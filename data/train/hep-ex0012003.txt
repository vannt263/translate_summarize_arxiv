    "@xmath0 compact muon solenoid ( cms ) @xcite is one of the two general - purpose major detectors for the lhc accelerator .",
    "the main goal of this experiment is a precise test of the standard model and observation of the higgs boson as well as the search for diverse signatures of new physics .",
    "it will be achieved by identifying and precisely measuring muons , electrons and photons over a large energy range , by determining the signatures of quarks and gluons through the measurement of jets of charged and neutral particles ( hadrons ) with moderate precision , and by measuring the missing transverse energy flow , which will enable the signatures of non - interacting new particles as well as neutrinos to be identified .",
    "@xmath0 the standard model higgs boson with a mass between 95 and 150 @xmath1 would be discovered via its two - photon decay , with a mass between 135 and 525 @xmath1  in the four - lepton channel .",
    "tagging the events produced by ww- and zz - fusion by detecting the characteristic forward jets , and using decay modes with larger branching ratios ( h @xmath2 ww @xmath2 lvjj , and h @xmath2 zz @xmath2 lljj ) should allow the discovery range for sm higgs boson to be extended up to 1 tev .",
    "the two - photon and four - lepton channels are also crucial for the discovery of the higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model",
    ". events with many high energy jets and large missing transverse energy are the obvious and model independent signature in searches for the supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons .    @xmath0the cms calorimeters will play a significant role in exploiting the physics potential offered by lhc .",
    "the main functions are to identify and measure precisely the energy of photons and electrons , to measure the energy of jets , and to provide hermetic coverage for measuring the missing transverse energy .",
    "in addition , good efficiency for electron and photon identification as well as excellent background rejection against hadrons and jets are required .",
    "@xmath0 one of the principal cms objectives is to construct a very high performance electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "a homogeneous scintillating crystal calorimeter with high granularity gives the best performance for energy resolution enhancing the h @xmath3 discovery potential at the initially lower luminosities .",
    "the choice of crystals for ecal , as well as the thinness of the barrel calorimetry , imposes severe constraints on the hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) design and tempers its performance .",
    "in particular , the cms calorimeter system is strongly non - compensating .",
    "this leads to a non - gaussian energy distribution and non - linear response in energy to hadrons .",
    "@xmath0 in order to ensure a gaussian response and good linearity of the calorimetry systems , different weighting methods for reconstruction of the hadron energy , which have the effect of simultaneously minimizing the non - linearity and the energy resolution can be employed .",
    "@xmath0the present paper is devoted to the application of a feed - forward neural network for reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cms calorimeter system by hadrons and jets .",
    "a significant improvement of the energy resolution and linearity in comparison with other weighting methods has been achieved .",
    "@xmath0the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 a brief description of the cms and its calorimeter system is presented . in section 3 ,",
    "some aspects of development of hadron showers in the sampling calorimeters are considered and two of the conventional weighting methods for reconstruction of the pion and jet energy in the case of cms are applied .",
    "a basic information about neural networks and their usage for processing signals from calorimetry systems is given in section 4 . in section 5 , details of our approach to the application of neural networks for energy reconstruction and the particular feed - forward network used in the case of cms detector are described .",
    "the results obtained are presented in section 6 .",
    "@xmath0 the cms @xcite detector has an overall length of 21.6 m , with a calorimeter coverage up to a pseudorapidity of @xmath4 , a radius of 7.5 m , and a total weight of about 12500 t ( see figure 1.cms ) .",
    "cms consists of a powerful inner tracking system , a scintillating crystal electromagnetic calorimeter followed by a sampling hadron calorimeter mounted inside the cryostat vessel of the 4 t solenoidal superconducting magnet , 13 m long with an inner diameter of 5.9 m. the magnet is surrounded by 5 `` wheels '' ( cylindrical structure ) and 2 endcaps ( disks ) of muon absorber and muon tracking chambers composing the muon detector system .",

    "the active medium is made out of scintillating lead tungstate crystals ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the choice is based on the following properties of these crystals : a short radiation length of 0.89 cm , a small moliere radius of 2.19 cm , the scintillating process is fast  85 @xmath7 of the light is emitted in 20 ns .",
    "the transverse granularity of @xmath8 x @xmath9= @xmath10 x @xmath10 . corresponds to a crystal front face of about 22 x 22 @xmath11 . in the endcaps @xmath12 ,",
    "the granularity increases progressively to a maximum value of @xmath8 x @xmath9= @xmath13 x @xmath13 .",
    "the total thickness of about 26 radiation lengths , corresponding to a crystal length 23 cm is enough to limit the longitudinal shower leakage to an acceptable level .",
    "the presence of a preshower ( 3 @xmath14 of lead ) in the endcap region allows the use of slightly shorter crystals ( 22 cm ) .",
    "the light produced by an incident particle is detected by avalanche photodiodes in the barrel and by vacuum phototriodes in the endcap .",

    "both the barrel and endcap calorimeters experience the 4 tesla field of the cms solenoid and hence are necessarily fashioned out of non - magnetic material ( copper alloy and stainless steel ) .",
    "the central hadron calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter : it consists of active material inserted between copper absorber plates .",
    "the absorber plates are 5 cm thick in the barrel and 8 cm thick in the endcap .",
    "the active elements are 4 mm thick plastic scintillator tiles read out using wavelength shifting plastic fibres .",
    "the tiles are arranged in a tower structure pointing to the interaction center .",

    "the ho has only single sampling layers .",
    "@xmath0 to extend the hermeticity of the central hadron calorimeter system up to @xmath21 , in order to have good missing transverse energy measurement , cms employs a separate forward calorimeter ( hf ) located 6 m downstream of the he endcaps .",

    "<    a copper absorber matrix .    @xmath0 in order to minimize non - gaussian tails in the hadron energy distribution and to ensure a linear response to hadron energy , the inner barrel hadron calorimeter is divided radially ( in depth ) into two sampling hadron compartments ( hb1 and hb2 ) .",
    "there is an initial layer of sampling immediately following the ecal electronics , and 17 layers of sampling coupled together into single tower read - out .",
    "the he is also segmented into two different sampling compartments ( he1 and he2 ) . there again is initial sampling layer , followed by 18 layers joined into a single tower read - out .",
    "the ho layers form towers matching the inner hadron calorimeter granularity and are read out separately . in this way , for reconstruction of the hadron energy , in every ( @xmath23 ) tower , signals from four longitudinal read - outs ( ecal , hb1 , hb2 and ho ) are used .",
    "@xmath0an important issue is the absolute calibration of the cms calorimeter system , used to determine the energy scale . for the ecal ,",

    "the absolute single hadron test beam calibration will be transferred to the rest of the calorimeter with the help of the same radioactive source .",

    "@xmath0the reconstruction of the energy of a particle entering the calorimetry system is a nontrivial task .",
    "the difficulties are determined , first of all , by the complicity of the physical processes taking place in the development of the electromagnetic and hadron showers and the mechanism of creation of the signal in the active elements of the detectors .",
    "this leads to big fluctuations in the signals of the calorimetry system , especially in the case of hadrons ( the so called intrinsic fluctuations ) . in the case of sampling calorimeters ,",
    "only a fraction of the shower energy is dissipated in the active medium and the energy resolution is affected significantly by the fluctuations in this fraction ( sampling fluctuations ) .",
    "hadron calorimeters , because the large depth required to incorporate almost the full shower , are by necessity sampling calorimeters .",
    "@xmath0there is an essential difference between development of a shower initiated by electrons and photons ( electromagnetic ) and the one initiated by hadrons . in the first case ( assuming enough deep calorimeter ) high energy electron or photon incident on a calorimeter initiates a cascade of secondary electrons and photons via bremstrahlung and pair production .",
    "the multiplication continues until the energies of secondary particles fall bellow the critical energy .",
    "the further dissipation of energy is dominated by ionization and excitation .",
    "the visible energy is proportional to the energy dissipated in the calorimeter even in the case of sampling calorimeter .",
    "@xmath0the mechanism for hadron shower production is quite different since it involves multiparticle production in deep inelastic hadron - nucleus collisions at high energies and thus the elementary processes are determined by the strong interactions .",
    "the large number of possible interaction processes makes the shower development more complex . the cascade is mostly composed of nucleons and pions . a significant part of pions are @xmath32 ( @xmath33 )",
    ", as a result the cascade contains two distinct components namely the electromagnetic one ( @xmath32 s etc ) and the hadron one ( @xmath34 , n , etc ) .",
    "the electromagnetic component is determined essentially by the first interaction and is subject of considerable event - to - event non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "it increases with energy due to the fact that the neutral pions , developing as electromagnetic showers , do not produce any hadron interactions .",
    "the response of hadron sampling calorimeter is a function of the energy deposited in the active elements by electromagnetic component , charged hadrons , low energy neutrons and energy lost in breaking up nuclei ( invisible energy ) .",
    "the last one can be large enough and for heavy absorbers it reaches up to 40 @xmath7 of hadron part of the energy .",
    "thus the ratio of response to electromagnetic and hadron showers ( @xmath35 ) is usually @xmath36 and is a function of the initial energy ( non - compensating calorimeters ) .",
    "this leads to a non - gaussian measured distribution for mono - energetic hadrons , a non - linear response in energy to hadrons and an additional contribution to the relative energy resolution ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is possible to achieve a compensation ( @xmath38 ) by suppression of the electromagnetic signal or by boosting the non e.m .",
    "however the requirement for precise electromagnetic calorimetry is non compatible with compensation and leads , as a rule , to strongly non - compensating calorimetry systems .",
    "@xmath0another problem caused by non - compensation is the dependence of the calorimeter response on the type of the incident particle .",
    "the response for single hadrons and jets is different , because significant part of the jet energy is carried by electrons and photons .",
    "due to the different cross - sections for creation of @xmath32-mesons even for pions and protons the response of the calorimetry system is not equal .",
    "the cms calorimetry system is a typical example for strongly non - compensating hadron calorimeter .",
    "@xmath0 in order to achieve a good linearity , gaussian energy distribution and the best possible energy resolution , different methods for reconstruction of the energy deposited in the calorimetry system are used .",
    "the idea is to find such calibration coefficients ( weights ) which take into account the peculiarities of the development of the hadron shower . in order to investigate the applicability of the various reconstruction techniques in the case of cms calorimetry system we have simulated the detector response to electrons and pions ( with energies 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 and 500 gev ) and single jets ( with energies 30,50,100,200,300 and 500 gev ) entering the ecal at @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath0 in the most common approach ( in what follows we shall refer to it as to sm ) , the energy of a single shower is given by the weighted sum of the energies deposited by it in the calorimetry system @xmath41 where the index @xmath42 corresponds to the four longitudinal compartments of the calorimeter ( ecal , hb1 , hb2 and ho ) and @xmath43 is the sum of the energies measured in the transversal towers in the @xmath44 readout .",
    "given a large enough number of showers with known incident energy @xmath45 , the weights are determined by minimization of the width of the energy distribution with additional constraint @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath0we have used the simulated pion data to determine the coefficients @xmath47 .",
    "the weights are energy dependent .",
    "this dependence is very strong for @xmath48 , which is not surprising , taking into account , that for the ecal @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath48 is fixed at the value obtained by using electron calibration , big non - linearity and non - gaussian tails in the energy distributions for pions and jets are observed , especially at low energies . the way to improve the situation is to determine @xmath48 using pions , but this requires a very clear identification in the off - line analysis of the type of the particles .",
    "the jet energy resolution evaluated by using the weights obtained for 300 gev pions ( this corresponds to calibration of the calorimeter in 300 gev pion beam , see the previous section ) is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : res300 ] . the linearity defined as    @xmath50",
    "is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : lin ] .",
    "the different electromagnetic content in the hadron showers developed by pions and jets and the non - compensation of the calorimetry system lead to the nonlinear response and induces a big constant term in the energy resolution .",
    "we have used the weights obtained for 300 gev jets ( that corresponds to in situ calibration with physical events ) to reconstruct the energy . as a result",
    "the linearity has been improved slightly ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lin ] ) and the constant term of the energy resolution has been reduced significantly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res300 ] ) .",
    "however this step does not solve the problem with non - gaussian tails in the energy distributions and non linear response of the calorimeter .",
    "when we use energy dependent weights for reconstruction of the energy , the linearity is restored but the energy resolution does not change ( fig .  [ fig : smh1fitr ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 in the sm method the weights are sensible to the average of the fluctuations in the development of the hadron shower . when applied to individual events",
    ", they always involve large errors .",
    "a better approach is to use a method where a different correction factor is applied to each event , depending on its nature .",
    "several weighting techniques have been developed @xcite with the idea to suppress the signal from the electromagnetic component of hadron shower ( the so called h1-technique ) .",
    "the h1-technique we apply is of the following form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy deposited in the jth transversal tower of the ith longitudinal read - out .",
    "the weights @xmath53 and @xmath54 have been determined in the same way like in the sm approach .",
    "the results obtained are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : res300 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : lin ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : smh1fitr ] . the energy resolution is slightly improved mainly due to the reduction of the constant term .",
    "however the nonlinearity is still too big , especially at lower energies .",
    "obviously within these methods it is not possible to achieve good linearity and gaussian response .",
    "@xmath0to ensure the best possible measurement of the energy , when dealing with noncompensating calorimeters , the following requirements should be satisfied :    @xmath0 to every individual event , different correction factor should be applied ( due to the big fluctuations of the hadron shower development ) ;    @xmath0 using the lateral and longitudinal energy distribution ( the only available information from the calorimeter ) , the amount of the energy dissipated in the calorimeter by electromagnetic showers ( electromagnetic part of the hadron shower ) should be estimated ;    @xmath0 the type of the particle ( electron / photon , hadron or jet ) should be determined .",
    "@xmath0of course the spatial energy distribution does not gives the full information about the development of the hadron shower , however it is possible taking into account correlations between signals to determine the type of the initiator of the shower , and to estimate roughly the energy of the electromagnetic part of the shower .",
    "for example , using the longitudinal distribution of the energy , it is possible to separate electrons ( big signal in the ecal and almost nothing in the hcal ) from pions and jets .",
    "there is a significant difference in the lateral radius of the electromagnetic and hadron showers  the radius of the hadron shower is much bigger then the electromagnetic one .",
    "this feature can be used for estimation of the electromagnetic content of the shower . in some sense",
    "the h1-technique accounts for this difference and manifests better energy resolution and linearity .",
    "@xmath0to solve the problem of energy reconstruction we need a method which is able to deal with many parameters , is sensitive to correlations between them and is flexible enough to react to fluctuations in the development of the hadron shower .",
    "one possible solution is the application of neural networks , which have proved their efficiency in such a complicated environment .",
    "@xmath0 the neural networks ( nn ) are a powerful tool , which can be used for feature extraction , association , optimization , function fitting , and modeling .",
    "they have found numerous applications @xcite in the high energy physics , such as classification of particles and final states , track reconstruction , cluster trigger , particle identification , reconstruction of invariant masses and other off - line analysis @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 the neural network is a system composed of many simple processing elements operating in parallel whose function is determined by network structure , connection strengths , and the processing performed at computing elements or nodes .",
    "the basic computing unit of nn is a neuron . a multi - layer feed forward ( mlff ) network consists of a set of input neurons , one or more layers of hidden neurons , and a set of output neurons .",
    "the neurons of each layer are connected to the ones in the subsequent layer .",
    "@xmath0the neurons ( fig .",
    "1.nn ) perform calculations in three steps via their input i , activation a and output o functions .",
    "usually they are chosen in the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the connections weights , @xmath57 is some threshold . in most of the architectures",
    "a bias @xmath58 is implemented as an incoming link connected to a constant value 1 .",
    "the weight of the connection is trained like all other weights .",
    "@xmath0 mlff networks are , usually , trained using the backpropagation learning algorithm @xcite .",
    "it includes three steps : presentation of a pattern to the network , comparison of the desired output with the actual network output , backwards calculation of the error and adjustment of the weights ( wij ) .",
    "this is done by minimization of the error function , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the output of the net and @xmath61 is the corresponding element of teaching sample .",
    "backpropagation algorithm uses an updating rule :    @xmath62 ,    where @xmath63 is the learning rate .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath63 varies significantly during the learning of the nn .",
    "for that reason we have chosen another learning algorithm  rprop @xcite .",
    "it uses an individual learning rate for each weight combined with the manhattan updating rule @xcite :    @xmath64\\ ] ]    at every step , @xmath63 is adjusted as :    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath0 there are two possible approaches to the problem of the energy reconstruction with the assistance of nn .",
    "the first one is to use nn directly to determine the energy dissipated in the calorimetry system .",
    "such an approach has been applied in the case of gamma - ray energy determination with gilda imaging silicon calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the energy reconstruction is performed in two steps . in the first stage ,",
    "a net performs a rough classification of the gamma energies in six groups .",
    "then , for each group , a dedicated net proceeds to discriminate among the different energy values . at the second stage",
    "each net has an output layer , which consists of ni nodes , equal to the number of the different energy subclasses used in the training phase .",
    "the net has a discrete output and is able to classify only those energies used during the training .",
    "since gamma rays have a continuous energy distribution , the following weighted average over the values of output neurons is performed :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the energy corresponding to gamma rays of class @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the activation value of the output neuron @xmath70 .    @xmath0 an analogues algorithm for reconstruction of the energy in the case of cms detector has been applied .",
    "this scheme has shown significant distortion of spectrum shape , bad energy resolution and a big nonlinearity .",
    "obviously , this is a consequence of the more complicated structure and bigger fluctuations of hadron showers in this case .",
    "@xmath0a slightly different approach was used to determine the energy correction factors for the atlas detector @xcite using recurrent neural network with nearest neighbour feedback in the input layer and a single output giving the corrected energy value .",
    "it was shown that the network performs satisfactory , but there is no comparison of the results obtained in this approach with results given by more conventional algorithms .",
    "@xmath0the second possibility is to use the neural network for adjustment of the weights @xmath72 in ( 1 ) on event by event basis .",
    "we shall developed it in what follows .",
    "@xmath0the idea of our method is : to tune the weights ( calibration coefficients ) @xmath47 in ( 1 ) for the four longitudinal readouts of the calorimetry system on event by event basis , using the available information about lateral and transversal development of the hadron shower .",
    "such an approach is more flexible and allows to take into account the quite different behaviour ( for example  different e / h - ratio ) of the electromagnetic and hadron compartments of the cms calorimetry system .",
    "@xmath0as it was mentioned above , the calorimeter system of cms is non - compensating . as a result",
    ", there is difference between optimal calibration coefficients for jets , hadrons and electrons .",
    "therefore , in order to improve the energy reconstruction , it is preferable to identify the type of the initiator of the shower .",
    "@xmath0 the data processing is divided in two steps : first , identification of the type of the incident particle and second , determination of the energy deposited in the calorimeter .",
    "correspondingly , we use two - level neural network .",
    "the first level network classifies the hadron showers in four classes , respectively , initiated by :    * mainly electromagnetic interacting particles - @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "* mainly strong interacting particles - hadrons .",
    "* muons .",
    "@xmath0the energy reconstruction is then performed by a dedicated network for each class of showers .",
    "the second level network has four subnets ( fig2.nn ) corresponding to the four longitudinal read - outs .",
    "the activation values of the four output neurons give the relevant correction factors for the weights in the sm .",

    "this corresponds to matrix of towers with size 41x41 for the ecal and with size 7x7 for the hcal . because the number of towers is too large , in order to reduce the number of network input neurons , we merge together transversal towers , by summing the energies in concentric squares as shown on fig . 3.nn .",
    "@xmath0 during the training phase the nn stands in need of some additional neurons . the supplementary part of the network is represented on fig .",
    "outputs ( out1 ... out4 ) of the basic network are connected with four hidden neurons with input function @xmath85 and activation function @xmath86 .",

    "additionally , we correct the output teaching samples with factor @xmath87 in order to obtain correct contribution from different energies to the error function ( 4 ) of the net . without this correction ,",
    "the contribution to the error function of events with low energies is minor and as a result , the connection weights of the nn are tuned to reconstruct well only high energy showers .",
    "the same correction is applied to the values of the extra inputs . during the learning phase",
    ", the weights of the connections ( @xmath88 ) - @xmath89 , ( @xmath90)-@xmath91 and ( @xmath92 ) - @xmath93 , are treated like all other weights in the nn .",
    "after the learning is finalized , the supplementary part of the net is removed .",
    "@xmath0the reconstructed energy is calculated as : @xmath94 where @xmath71 are activation values of the output neurons of nn , @xmath95 and @xmath80 are the energies deposited in the longitudinal read - outs .the coefficients @xmath96 are fixed during the learning of the nn .",
    "variations in the shower development are accounted by @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath0 of course it is possible to reach better efficiency of recognition using additional information from the central tracker , but for our purposes it is more important to classify the showers according to their specific energy distribution in the calorimetry system . then even in the case of wrong recognition of the initializing particle",
    ", it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the shower with good accuracy . the reconstructed energy by nn for 300 gev jet showers , classified by nn as single hadron showers is shown on fig .  [ fig : nnjp ] .",
    "the reason for misidentification is that in those cases the shower characteristics are very close to the one for pion showers .",

    "the part of wrongly classified events is small and the reconstruction of their energies is satisfactory .",

    "the stochastic term is lower than this evaluated with the h1 technique ( @xmath118 ) mainly due to the improvement of the resolution for low energies .",

    "first , the showers are classified by the nn , according to the type of the initializing particle ( muon , electron , single hadron , hadron jet ) , a high enough efficiency of recognition has been achieved .",
    "it is shown , that even if the shower is misidentified , its energy is reconstructed correctly . at the second step , for the every class of events ,",
