    "among the various types of so - called guest - host systems ( see e.g. , the recent review @xcite containing numerous relevant references ) one of the simplest type can be constructed from two kinds of particles , the strongly coupled host atoms forming structural cavities , and guest atoms , which can be captured in the cavities .",
    "the term guest atoms already indicates that they should not play a strong structural role although actual host structures may become unstable in the absence of the guest .",
    "we may , therefore consider the situation of guest particles that are confined within the cavities , but apart from this , are only weakly interacting with the host atoms .",
    "the interest to study these systems reflects both , their potential practical importance ( related to the possibility of selectively tuning mechanical , electrical , or thermal properties ) , and the associated theoretical challenges .",
    "however , complexity of composition of existing guest - host systems ( like clathrate hydrates , or skutterudites ) that underlies the rich physical properties , poses a formidable problem to theoretical and computational modeling efforts .",
    "although a number of detailed experimental investigations and sophisticated calculations and numerical computations have been published over the last few years ( see , e.g. , papers @xcite - @xcite , which partially will be commented upon in our paper , and much more can be easily added to this list ) , there is still a clear need for a simple ( but yet non - trivial ) theoretical model with predictions , which can be confronted with experimental observations .",
    "the fact ( perhaps a bit taste - dependent ) is that more or less realistic and complete theoretical or numerical investigations of existing guest - host systems ( with about 50 atoms per elementary cell ) do not yield simple intuitive ( yet based on firm physical principles ) explanations of the vibrational excitation broadening and the considerable reduction of thermal conductivity upon filling of the host structural cavities with guest atoms . in spite of the fact that the basic concepts describing vibrational excitations and thermal transport were born long ago and can be found in the textbooks @xcite , @xcite , many questions of principle remain to be settled for guest - host systems ( see e.g. the discussions about einstein rattlers in the very recent papers @xcite , @xcite , or about electric dipole force contributions in @xcite ) . in part",
    "this frustrating situation is just due to the lack of a simple and tractable analytical model .",
    "our motivation for adding one more paper to the topic is precisely to propose such a model .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section [ bas ]",
    "we formulate our model of a simplest guest - host system and calculate dispersion curves . in section [ mod ]",
    "we derive self - consistent equations for vibrational mode broadening , which are solved numerically in section [ num ] .",
    "based on this solution we compute also thermoconductivity coefficients .",
    "section [ con ] is devoted to a discussion , and summary of our main results .",
    "we shall recall certain basic facts about the guest - host systems .",
    "a generic structural feature of this class of solids is that their lattices are formed by the strongly interacting host atoms or molecules . on the contrary",
    "the guest molecules can be located only in the cages formed within the host structure .",
    "the basic interaction between the guest molecule and the host lattice is generally weaker than between the host molecules , i.e. the elastic force controlling the guest particle s vibrations is somehow small .",
    "however , for larger displacements the interaction between the guest and host lattice becomes stronger holding the guest particles firmly within the cage .",
    "the guest - host interaction can in this sense be assimilated to an inverted hard - core potential , soft in the center and hard outside .",
    "the weak elastic coupling property leads to the presence of low - frequency or soft dispersion sheets in the system , which correspond to the vibrations of the guest molecules within the cage . for the sake of simplicity , let us sketch first a one - dimensional cartoon ( see fig .",
    "1 ) corresponding to our model structure ( later on in the next section we will do a proper 3d calculation ) . essential for our model is that the guest - host structure elementary cell contains two kinds of particles : structural atoms @xmath0 ( host ) and guest atoms @xmath1 . in equilibrium",
    "the @xmath0 atoms occupy positions @xmath2 , and there are only nearest neighbor interactions between the @xmath0 atoms .",
    "guest atoms @xmath1 are located between the atoms @xmath0 at the equilibrium positions @xmath3 and they interact only with the host atoms forming their cages .        the elastic energy for such a system can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a displacement of atom @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the host -host and guest -host force constants .",
    "soft guest modes require that @xmath9 .    for the ease of algebra we are using dimensionless units where both masses ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms )",
    "are set equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamical equations describing the eigenmodes and eigenvectors of this system read as @xmath11    using the standard ansatz for the excitations of the form @xmath12 this system of equations reduces to @xmath13 nontrivial solutions exists at @xmath14 ( acoustic branch ) or @xmath15 ( optical branch ) given by the relation @xmath16 the spectrum of eigenmodes as defined by equation ( [ 4 ] ) is presented in figures [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the force constants are choose as @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] @xmath18 as before but the guest - host force constant is appreciably smaller , @xmath19 .",
    "calculating the eigenvectors of the system ( [ 3 ] ) it is easy to show , that the region of small wave - vectors within the acoustic branch corresponds to in - phase oscillations of both host and guest atoms . for the case presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the region of large wave - vectors of the lower `` soft '' branch corresponds to oscillations of dominantly the guest atoms .",
    "the flat part of this branch resembles that of einstein - like independent rattling oscillations , which are widely discussed in the literature @xcite - @xcite . despite a certain similarity",
    "we would like to stress that , in our model the flatness of the branch reflects the soft dynamics of the guest atoms , and not decoupled dynamics of einstein oscillators @xcite .",
    "( 1d model).,width=302 ]     ( 1d model).,width=302 ]    as can be easily demonstrated the property controlling the form of the spectrum ( [ 4 ] ) is the minimal value @xmath20 of the gap @xmath21 between the two branches .",
    "it reads as @xmath22 ( cp . with the direct absolute gap defined as @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore , as had to be expected the ratio @xmath24 is ( up to a scaling factor ) the only relevant parameter in our model . upon decreasing the ratio @xmath24 ,",
    "one gets a more extended  flat ",
    "part of the spectrum ( what is supposed to be a ",
    "rattler-like decay channel increasing mode broadening ) .",
    "even more , the reader may be surprised to learn that for sufficiently small @xmath25 the large @xmath26 ( short wavelength ) upper branch group velocity , could become larger than the long wavelength acoustic mode ( sound ) speed . in these unusual conditions",
    "one would have phonon broadening of this branch via interactions to the lowest lying long wavelength acoustic mode , which for normal downward sloping modes are forbidden due to momentum and energy conservation rules .",
    "however , upon decreasing the @xmath24 ratio , we simultaneously increase the gap ( [ h1 ] ) and therefore the mode anharmonic coupling ( see the next section [ mod ] for more details ) to provide comparable with a larger value of the @xmath24 broadening , should be much stronger .    thus for strong broadening there is a certain optimum value of the ratio @xmath24 , not too small ( to have a reasonably strong mode coupling ) and not too large ( to have a reasonably extended flat spectrum ) . instead of a full systematic study of these issues",
    "we perform in this work a few numerical estimates to narrow down the focus of our problem . in what follows just this optimal range of the model parameters",
    "will be investigated .",
    "summarizing up to this point , for our minimal model in the harmonic approximation we have at our disposition one physical parameter @xmath24 that allows us to tune two phenomena ( namely , mode flatness and mode softness , however not independently ) that contribute to vibrational broadening and thermoconductivity reduction .",
    "one might generalize the model to include also guest - guest coupling .",
    "however , because it is not a major goal of our work to achieve agreement between the results obtained with our phenomenological model and experimental measurements , we defer the generalization to future publications . nevertheless since the present understanding of mechanisms leading to thermoconductivity reduction in guest - host systems is incomplete , even our minimal model may be an appropriate tool for working out typical trends that in principle can be tested in experiments .",
    "phonons are crucial for the understanding not only of vibrational properties but equally of a material s electric and thermal transport .",
    "they are also at the heart of a broad range of interesting electro - mechanical effects .",
    "in particular for the transport properties phonon decay plays an important role .",
    "the problem of phonon decay has a rather long history , and the phenomenon has been treated in quite some depth in order to rationalize neutron scattering data concerning collective excitations .",
    "theoretical concepts on anharmonic vibrational modes in crystalline materials have been developed in the seminal papers by peierls @xcite , pomeranchuk @xcite , herring @xcite , and klemens @xcite ( see also early works on the decay of an optical phonon into two acoustic phonons via anharmonicities @xcite , @xcite , and a more recent publication @xcite ) .",
    "the short version of the formal machinery starts as its initial step to uncouple the coupled lattice oscillators , and then to express the hamiltonian for the vibrating lattice as a sum of separate oscillators .",
    "free phonons ( in our model with the dispersion laws ( [ 4 ] ) ) result from the quantization of these oscillators . in the harmonic ( quadratic over lattice displacements )",
    "approximation there is no interaction between phonon states , and an arbitrary number of phonons may be present in each mode .",
    "the anharmonic terms present the processes involving three and more phonons describing their decay or coalescence . to find the broadening for the phonon dispersions calculated in the previous section [ bas ] in the harmonic approximation one has to include phonon - phonon interaction self - consistently .",
    "the diagram technique is an appropriate tool to treat such a problem .",
    "we skip almost all general technical details , and focus here on ingredients indispensable for our calculations .    to be more specific we take into account only three wave interactions , because usually these interactions are responsible for the mode broadening @xcite - @xcite . in the symmetric case these three phonon couplings are vanishing , we thus have to introduce asymmetry into our simple model in order to achieve non - zero three - wave interaction .",
    "the asymmetry can be related to a off - center position of the guest atom within the cage , or merely non symmetric spring constants between the guest atom and the cavity walls . in this case",
    "the anharmonic higher order couplings do not introduce new physics , but only renormalize parameter values of the coupling terms . since these spring constants are not well known , we regard their values as phenomenological coefficients . in this sense",
    "our model should be treated as a working hypothesis .",
    "comparison of the qualitative predictions resulting from this hypothesis with experimental or microscopical numerical observations will show whether and when this hypothesis is justified .",
    "note also that it is a priori no problem to include also fourth order anharmonic couplings into the same self - consistent treatment .",
    "this will not affect our qualitative and semi - quantitative conclusions much ( albeit at the expense of rapidly increasing complexity ) .",
    "we do believe that with the aim of answering first simple questions transparency is worth a few simplifications .",
    "guided by this principle we consider in what follows only three wave couplings and only high temperatures @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the debye temperature .",
    "in canonical phonon variables the hamiltonian of the system can be presented as @xmath29 the vertex @xmath30 for the interaction of three phonons with quasi wave - vectors @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and frequencies @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is proportional to the product @xmath37 for simplicity we suppose that the parameter @xmath38 is a constant . for the sake of the skeptical reader we should note , that if the above mentioned asymmetry of the guest - host interactions or / and equilibrium positions is somewhat small",
    ", the three - wave interaction vertex @xmath30 has to be small as well .",
    "it is not to say that guest - host vibrational mode coupling is small . indeed , as a guest atom approaches the wall of the cavity , repulsive interactions become dominant and the host atoms in the vicinity of the wall are pushed back to decrease the unfavorable interactions .",
    "consequently , host - guest vibrations are strongly coupled , even though the direct attractive potential between the guest and the host lattice is small . to avoid too many unknown parameters we are not introducing explicitely this asymmetry coefficient in the ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "all the more that in this study we are predominantly concerned with only relative values of phonon mode broadenings and thermoconductivities for pure host and guest - host systems .",
    "the peculiarities of the phonon mode broadenings are related to the existence of the soft mode , and these effects are determined by inter - band coupling ( i.e. , the decay of one optical or acoustic phonon into two acoustic phonons , or into one acoustic and one optic phonon , and inverse coalescence processes , satisfying the simple selection rule that the created phonon must lie in a higher branch than at least one of the destroyed phonons ) integrated over the full range of wave vectors . in the one - loop approximation , the broadening of the phonon spectra can be determined from diagrams of the type schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] , where the lines describe phonons which decay or coalescence .",
    "we take into account all possible processes involving three phonons ( not only inter - band ones , mentioned above ) .        calculating these diagrams we end with the following system of equations to find the broadening of the phonon spectra @xmath39 here subscripts 1 and 2 stands for acoustic and optical branches of the spectrum",
    ", @xmath40 is the bose factor , @xmath41 . to stay in contact with experiments we consider only the high temperature case when the bose factor turns into the boltzmann law @xmath42 .",
    "one more comment is in order here .",
    "of course physical phonon damping is determined by the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 calculated at the actual mode dispersion laws ( [ 4 ] ) ( so - called  on - shell  phonon broadening ) .",
    "however as an intermediate step of calculations , when we wish to include self - consistently the effects of phonon damping ,  off - shell ",
    "functions @xmath45 can enter the above integral equations ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "we check that our self - consistent equations are stable with respect to off - shell virtual phonons , and thus their contributions are irrelevant for our work .",
    "then , the equations ( [ 7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . to take into account umklapp processes it is necessary to extend the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 into the region",
    "@xmath52 $ ] as a periodical repeat of the first brillouin zone @xmath53 $ ] . equations ( [ 8 ] ) give the imaginary part of the one - loop correction to the bare green functions , which determines the decrements .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the real part of this correction , which only changes the bare dispersion laws [ 4 ] , and treat the system ( [ 8 ] ) self - consistently in the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the system can be solved numerically , and as a result we can calculate the broadenings of the two branches ( [ 4 ] ) as a function of parameters @xmath56 and the ratio @xmath57 .",
    "these self - consistent equations ( [ 8 ] ) are derived yet for the one - dimensional model shown in fig . 1 , and the result overestimates the contributions from small wave - vectors ( although it is worth noting that as already pointed out by peierls @xcite for phonon - phonon interactions the major physical difference is between one dimension and higher .",
    "three - phonon interactions in one dimension are severely restricted and usually very weak )",
    ". however , the derivation can be easily generalized to three dimensional systems . because it is not a major goal of this work to achieve quantitative agreement between theoretical results obtained with this phenomenological model and experimental data , we restrict the three - dimensional consideration to the same vibrational modes ( one acoustic and one optic dispersion sheet ) . note",
    "also that for finite temperature ( @xmath27 ) three wave broadening , the integrals entering the self - consistent equations for the broadenings , only weakly depend on the region of wave vectors in the vicinity of the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "therefore , aiming only at a qualitative description of experimental data , in the first approximation one can perform this integration over an appropriately ( i.e. , with equal volumes ) chosen spherical volume . combining everything together we end up with the following three dimensional self - consistent equations for the mode broadening in the guest - host system .",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the self - consistency equations ( [ 9 ] ) include as pointed out above only two modes : one optic and one acoustic ( the latter one is longitudinal by its construction ) .",
    "thus , we have in particular neglected two transverse acoustic modes .",
    "lax et al . , @xcite have shown that a given acoustic phonon can not decay into other modes with higher velocity at any order in the anharmonicity . for the lowest - lying acoustic phonon mode one",
    "then expects anomalously long lifetimes .",
    "similarly the phonon umklapp processes have negligible effect on the heat flux carried by the low - energy phonons with small wave vectors .",
    "the latter would lead to very high thermal conductivity .",
    "for this reason , calculating the phonon broadening and thermal conductivity , we cut - off corresponding integrals ( see below ) at a certain small wave vector .",
    "being interested in the only relative effects upon inserting guest atoms into the host lattice , this , and some other approximations made above driven by pure desire to make formulae simpler and to clarify physical ideas , do not affect our conclusions on the thermoconductivity reduction qualitatively .",
    "moreover all these assumptions are easy to relax , if needed , for example other phonon - scattering mechanisms , providing finite broadening for long - wave phonons , can be considered on the same footing .",
    "the self - consistent integral equations ( [ 9 ] ) are our main results and they are ready for further inspection to find their solutions . solving the system ( [ 9 ] )",
    "we find the broadening of the spectrum .",
    "luckily for us the solutions to these rather complicated looking equations ( e.g. , they are not symmetric with respect to @xmath60 exchange , as one could expect since there is no symmetry relation between acoustic and optic modes ) can be found quite fast numerically ( a few minutes for pc even using standard mathematica software ) .",
    "thus we will present results in the form of computed mathematica plots .",
    "figure [ f4 ] presents the results for the following parameter values @xmath17",
    ", @xmath61 .",
    "each branch is presented by three lines , which correspond to @xmath50 and @xmath62 .",

    ".,width=302 ]    we should add that in the low - energy ( frequency ) region the vibrational density of states has to follow the well - known debye law @xmath63 .",
    "the wiggles shown in the fig .",
    "[ f5 ] on top of such a parabolic function are due to numerical artifacts .",
    "they can be easily eliminated by merely including more points in the integration code .",
    "since we are not interested in precise absolute numbers but only in the more or less correct shape of the curves , we restrict ourselves to only rather crude numerical calculations . in the harmonic approximation , the peaks in the vibrational density of states ( for the parameters corresponding to fig .",
    "[ f5 ] at @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) transform into van hove singularities ( see the fig .",
    "[ fnew5 ] ) .",
    "figure [ f6 ] presents the spectra for the parameter values @xmath18 , @xmath66 , and the same triple vertex @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see , that the broadening of the spectrum in this situation where the guest vibrations have softened with respect to the previous case is significantly larger .",
    ".,width=340 ]    figure [ f7 ] shows the calculated density of states for the same parameter values .",
    ".,width=340 ]    figure [ fnew7 ] shows ( similarly to fig .",
    "[ fnew5 ] ) the harmonic counterpart of the density of states shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] .",
    ".,width=340 ]    we should add that the value of the triple vertex used in our calculation was chosen such as to produce a broadening similar to that observed experimental in the case of soft guest vibrations , i.e.  such that for large wave - vector values the relative width of the phonon line @xmath67",
    ".    with all characteristics of the vibrational spectrum in hands , the thermal conductivity of the system @xmath68 can be calculated by the following expression derived from the boltzmann kinetic equation @xcite , @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the specific heat of the solid and the sum is taken over the two branches of the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , bluntly applied , this in the literature widely used formula for the thermoconductivity @xmath68 , is wrong .",
    "indeed , in the derivation of this expression it has been assumed that the three - phonon mechanism of thermal conductivity is operational for all phonon branches , because the energy fluxes carried by the various groups of phonons are additive , and the same is true for their contributions to @xmath71 .",
    "if that mechanism does not work for one group of phonons , it would not provide finite thermoconductivity .",
    "however , the expression ( [ 10 ] ) yields to a finite @xmath71 even if there were only normal ( conserving quasi - momenta ) processes , in contradiction to the notorious peierls theorem @xcite , claiming that normal processes yield to @xmath72 . luckily in our case ( isotropic three dimensional guest - host system with two modes with dispersion laws ( [ 4 ] )",
    ", this issue is not relevant .",
    "the predominant contributions into the integral ( [ 10 ] ) do not come from very small wave vectors ( excluded by our cut - off procedure ) , and for wave vectors larger than this cut - off , just the umklapp processes limit the thermal flux of higher energy phonons . the physical picture of heat transfer looks as follows .",
    "normal phonon - phonon collisions , in which the total quasi - momentum is conserved establish only local internal equilibrium in the phonons , and the umklapp processes adapt this local equilibrium to the temperature gradient , and establish a finite value for the thermal conductivity @xmath71 . with said above in mind we are calculating numerically @xmath71 accordingly with exp .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "we find that the thermal conductivity in the case , when guest vibrations are soft , turns out significantly smaller , than in the pure host system @xmath73 .",
    "this result is independent of the absolute value of the force constants and equally of the anharmonic coupling constant .",
    "thus , based on our calculations we anticipate that even a relatively modest softening of the guest atom vibrations should yield a noticeable reduction of thermoconductivity .",
    "we do believe that understanding of the underlying mechanisms is essential to predict the behavior .",
    "summarizing , in this paper we have investigated certain peculiar features of vibrational dynamics and thermal transport in guest - host systems . since these systems are rather complicated and depend on many not easily accessible microscopic parameters , any theoretical study has to rely first on very crude simplifications .",
    "the model investigated theoretically in our paper includes only the minimal ingredients necessary to capture generic features exhibited by the compounds studied by experiment .",
    "we consider only two kinds of particles : strongly coupled host atoms , which form the structural cavities , and guest atoms confined in these cavities . in spite of the confinement , for relatively small amplitude vibrations of the guest atoms , their interaction with the host particles",
    "is weaker than between the host atoms .",
    "one of the main difficulties in comparing the results of our effective and simplified model with specific experimental measurements or elaborated microscopic numerical simulations is the availability of an accurate connection between experimental control parameters and theoretical model coefficients .",
    "the actual values of the parameters are determined by the microscopic ( atomic level ) interactions , and are in fact unknown . without prior knowledge of the actual values of microscopic parameters",
    "we follow the logic of simplification . in our model",
    "the whole physics is lumped into the effective spring constants @xmath74 and @xmath75 and the three phonon interaction parameter @xmath76 .",
    "we calculate the vibrational mode ( phonon ) dispersion laws , and self - consistently the line broadenings for the empty and filled ( by the guest atoms ) cavities .",
    "we show that the soft phonon sheet ( which appears for guest atoms weakly bound in the cavities ) yields large mode broadening via three wave anharmonic mode coupling . in turn the umklapp part of this broadening reduces drastically the phonon thermoconductivity coefficient . we conclude that for a system with a soft mode vibrational spectrum the broadening is always considerably larger ( thermoconductivity is always considerably smaller ) than for a system without this soft mode ( provided all other characteristic are the same ) .",
    "many of the points made above can be found in the literature , and approaches similar to our paper have been made by other authors ( see e.g. the review paper @xcite and references therein ) . however , some important differences to our work should be noted .",
    "we focus our study ( and investigate in some detail ) on the interplay between softness of the guest mode vibration and the host atom elasticity . existing theoretical treatment of thermal conductivity is based on molecular dynamics simulations @xcite which should utilize model dependent microscopic interaction potentials , and the green - kubo relation for the extraction of the thermal conductivity from the heat current correlation functions .",
    "our calculations are much simpler and rely on a model ( with only two relevant phenomenological parameters ) that is based on general and qualitative assumptions .",
    "we feel that it accommodates a picture of the guest - host system vibrations and thermal transport without going into finer details .",
    "of course we are left with many questions unanswered which must be pursued in further work .",
    "more elaborated models including many particles in the elementary cell , a realistic ( corresponding to the crystalline symmetry ) brillouin zone etc .",
    ", can be treated within the same approach and with the same conceptual ingredients . for partially filled cavities in the gust - host systems",
    ", special care should be taken about defects ( both , point - like and extended imperfections , like pores and grain - boundaries ) . luckily some general conclusions can be obtained without calculations .",
    "first note that while the specific heat and group velocity entering the expression for the thermoconductivity ( [ 10 ] ) are not sensitive to crystal imperfections , the mean free path is . for point defects which are small compared to the wavelengths of interest , the phonon scattering cross section @xmath77 , ( where the coefficient @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath79 with @xmath80 effective volume of the defect , and @xmath81 is the mass difference between the defect , e.g. , guest atom , and the host atom mass @xmath82 ) .",
    "therefore point defects effectively scatter high frequency phonons ( however , it should be noted that this expression strictly applies to a random collection of dilute point defects , whereas the guest molecules are neither dilute nor randomly arranged ) . because mainly waves of a high group velocity make a substantial contribution to thermal conductivity , in our case mainly low frequencies play a role .",
    "it means that point defects are not very essential for our analysis .",
    "large size imperfections scatter independently of frequency with a scattering cross section of the order of their geometrical size .",
    "these separation of frequency scales would alow in principle to distinguish this contribution to the reduction of thermoconductivity from guest - host soft mode mechanism of the thermoconductivity reduction , investigated in our paper .",
    "in such a generalized model the precise mode spectrum turns out to be much more complicated than the one found in our paper .",
    "however , the additional subtleties do not modify the general picture beyond the thermoconductivity reduction . fact",
    "is that the parameter that tunes the anharmonic coupling in the high temperature limit @xmath27 only scales the final results .",
    "therefore we anticipate that in the optimum conditions ( see section [ bas ] above ) , the relative reduction of the thermal conductivity will be robust with respect to the made approximations and almost @xmath76 ( see the eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) ) independent . in this sense",
    "our minimal model is just at the border between those that are too primitive to fit even qualitatively the data , and those that fit the data too well by using too many parameters .",
    "our model may be an appropriate tool to generate predictions that can be in principle tested experimentally .",

    "<S> we propose a simple phenomenological model describing vibrational dynamics in a class of materials ( like clathrates ) , which are crystalline compounds with closed cavities in their structures . in the spirit of a minimalist approach , </S>",
    "<S> our model includes only the minimum of ingredients necessary to capture the generic features of this class of compounds as brought to light by experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we consider only two kinds of particles : strongly coupled host atoms , which form the structural cavities , and guest atoms confined in the cavities . in spite of the confinement , for relatively small amplitude vibrations of the guest atoms , </S>",
    "<S> their interaction with the host particles is assumed to be weaker than between the host atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate self - consistently the vibrational mode ( phonon ) line broadenings for the empty and filled ( by the guest atoms ) cavities . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the soft phonon dispersion sheet , which appears for weakly bonded guest atoms , yields to large mode broadening via three waves anharmonic mode coupling . in turn the umklapp part of this broadening reduces drastically the phonon thermoconductivity coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that for a system with a soft mode component in the vibrational spectrum phonon broadening is always larger and thermal conductivity is always appreciably smaller than for a system without this soft mode ( provided all other characteristics are the same ) . although our model is minimal , in the sense of ignoring the complexity of actual guest - host structures , when properly interpreted , it can yield quite reasonable values for a variety of measurable quantities . </S>"
