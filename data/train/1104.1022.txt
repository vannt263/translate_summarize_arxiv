    "so far , many different protocols have been proposed to generate such states in circuit qed setups @xcite .",

    "however , higher excitation modes of the quantum bus will introduce inhomogeneity because of the shorter wavelengths of the higher modes and decrease the ghz fidelity .",
    "moreover , uncontrolled dissipation might be coupled through the higher excitation modes and induce extra noise .",
    "it would be ideal to devise a ghz generation scheme that , while keeping the one - step , deterministic nature , would involve only a single mode of the quantum bus mediating the qubit interaction .    for this purpose , in the present paper , we consider @xmath0 superconducting transmon qubits homogeneously coupled to a superconducting transmission line resonator in the dispersive limit , i.e.",

    "we discuss how to probe the non - local nature and the genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement of the generated state and investigate the stability of the proposed scheme to inhomogeneities in the physical parameters .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , the qubit - resonator interaction does not commute with the free hamiltonian , and the qubit frequencies are tuned close to one resonator mode .",

    "our scheme is the first one - step deterministic generation protocol of ghz states which could be possibly implemented in the currently available circuit qed design .",

    "capacitively coupled to a superconducting transmission line resonator in the dispersive regime . in section [ protocol ]",
    "we describe the protocol for generating ghz states in our system . in section [ measuring ] , we discuss ways to confirm the @xmath0-partite nature of the entanglement in the generated states , and in section [ inhomogeneous_coupling_frequencies ] we study the effects of non - ideal physical parameters like inhomogeneities in the qubit - resonator coupling constants .",
    "we propose a solid - state implementation , based on an architecture of superconducting transmon qubits capacitively coupled to a quantum bus and derive an effective hamiltonian for the system , which exhibits the appropriate @xmath1 exchange interaction .",

    "the gate voltage involves a dc - part and an extra term depending on the state of the resonator , @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the interaction with the resonator appears via the gate charge @xmath22 , which implicitly includes the voltage @xmath23 .",
    "transmon qubits are more robust to @xmath24-noise than charge qubits due to their exponentially suppressed charge dispersion @xcite .",

    "since higher modes have frequencies which are multiples of the fundamental frequency , we can tune the qubit transition frequencies such that the detuning with respect to one mode of the resonator is one order of magnitude smaller than the detuning to all the other modes . under these conditions we can realize the dispersive limit for a single mode of the resonator and neglect the influence of higher modes , as is the case in experiments using one transmon qubit  @xcite .",
