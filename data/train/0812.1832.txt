    "water ( h@xmath0o ) maser emission is found throughout our galaxy , pinpointing unusual physical conditions towards many different astrophysical objects , including high- and low - mass star forming regions , planetary nebulae @xcite , mira variables @xcite and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite .",
    "they are also found outside our galaxy , such as in the centres of active galaxies @xcite . in order to study the occurrence of h@xmath0o  masers in our galaxy ,",
    "a large - scale untargetted survey has begun , called hops ( the h@xmath0o  southern galactic plane survey ; walsh et al .",
    "_ in preparation _ )",
    ". this survey will cover 90 square degrees of the southern galactic plane , searching for , amongst other things , h@xmath0o  masers .",
    "+ planetary nebulae ( pn ) are the end - phase of evolution for intermediate - mass ( @xmath3  1 - 8 m@xmath4 ) main sequence stars .",
    "these stars spend a significant fraction of their lives ( @xmath3  10@xmath5  yr ) on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , a phase characterised by copious mass - loss which results in thick , dusty , molecular envelopes ( see e.g. herwig 2005 for a review of agb evolution ) with expansion velocities of order  10 - 20  km  s@xmath1 . in the o - rich case , the envelopes of these agb stars can display emission from the masing species of sio , oh and h@xmath0o .",
    "the velocity profiles of these species ( e.g. deacon et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) are usually consistent with them having arisen in largely spherical shells around their host star ( e.g. cohen 1989 ) ; additionally , the velocity extent of the oh typically lies outside of and encloses that of the h@xmath0o .",
    "interferometric observations of these species reveal spatiokinematic distributions of maser spots that largely corroborate the suggested overall sphericity , sometimes with small deviations within the inner molecular envelopes ( e.g. bains et al .",
    "as the objects evolve past the tip of the agb , it is surmised that a fast wind emanates from the exposed stellar core @xcite and gradually the maser species are extinguished due to the loss of coherence length in the disrupted shell ( see e.g. van winckel 2003 for a review of post - agb evolution ) .",
    "it is this fast wind that is thought to amplify any existing asymmetries in the slower agb envelope , leading to the morphological evolution of the object from largely spherical to the array of shapes displayed by pn ( e.g. balick & frank 2002 ) .",
    "+ recent imaging of post - agb dust shells ( e.g. gledhill 2005 ) in scattered light has revealed a preponderance of axisymmetric structures , suggesting the window for turning on the shaping mechanism can be narrowed to the late agb / early post - agb phase .",
    "further , the slowly - growing subclass of ` water fountain ' sources ( first discovered and aptly named by likkel & morris 1988 ) , with about 10 members @xcite , can potentially elucidate the mystery of the shaping mechanism .",
    "water fountains are bipolar post - agb stars that display highly collimated and high velocity expanding regions ( typically @xmath6  @xmath7  100  km  s@xmath1 ) of h@xmath0o  maser emission .",
    "the spectral profile of the h@xmath0o  maser emission displays a larger velocity range of emission compared to that of oh , where present ; maps of the sources reveal that the oh emission traces the remnant molecular shell while the h@xmath0o  emission is shock - excited in collimated bipolar jets @xcite .",
    "observations seem to confirm the theory that these high velocity jets are likely driven by magneto - hydrodynamical processes @xcite .",
    "however , whether the observed strong magnetic fields originate from single stars or through binary interactions is still unclear .",
    "water fountains may therefore represent an extremely short - lived phase of post - agb evolution that all such objects pass through , where much of the shaping takes place via the sculpting caused by the high velocity jets .",
    "alternatively , they may be a special subset of stars , perhaps the more massive ones that evolve quicker and have sufficiently thick envelopes to shield clouds of h@xmath0o  vapour and preserve them to later be shocked into masing by the fast wind ( suarez et al .",
    "2007 ) . either way",
    ", their discovery represents an exciting new addition to the study of the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "+ in this letter , we report on the detection of a h@xmath0o  maser towards the young post - agb star known as oh  009.10.4 and b292 @xcite , which shows maser emission over the widest velocity range known in our galaxy , confirming it as a new addition to the short list of known water fountains . the post - agb star is associated with the iras source 180432116 .",
    "it is unusual in that it exhibits 1665mhz and 1612mhz oh maser emission , but not at 1667mhz @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is the only known post - agb star to show 1720mhz oh maser emission , which is thought to arise in the region where the agb and starting planetary nebula winds collide @xcite .",
    "previous observations of h@xmath0o  maser emission towards oh  009.10.4 @xcite showed emission covering 210kms@xmath1 , although the authors noted that there could be other maser features that were outside the observed velocity range . +",
    "the australia telescope national facility mopra telescope is a 22 m antenna located 26 km outside the town of coonabarrabran in new south wales , australia .",
    "it is at an elevation of 850 metres above sea level and at a latitude of 31@xmath8 south .",
    "+ observations of oh  009.10.4 were performed as part of the large survey hops on 2008 march 9 and 10 , using the on - the - fly mapping method .",
    "total on - source integration time is approximately two minutes .",
    "the mopra spectrometer ( mops ) was used in `` zoom '' mode , which allows us to simultaneously observe 16 different frequencies , each with 4096 channels across a bandwidth of 137.5mhz , corresponding to 0.45kms@xmath1  per channel . to observe h@xmath0o  masers , we employed two contiguous zoom bands , allowing us to search for maser emission over a velocity range between 2395 and + 1326kms@xmath1 .",
    "+ data were reduced using livedata and gridzilla , which are both aips++ packages written for the parkes radiotelescope and adapted for mopra .",
    "followup observations of oh  009.10.4 were made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on 2008 july 12 and 13 , using the h214 hybrid array .",
    "observations were made using three different frequencies spaced 26mhz apart , each 32mhz wide and containing 512 channels , equivalent to 0.84kms@xmath1  per channel .",
    "together , the three frequencies covered a velocity range of 395 to + 670kms@xmath1with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "observations were made with one linear polarisation , were phase referenced to either 1730130 or 1817254 and flux calibrated using 1934638 .",
    "we estimate the flux scale will be accurate to around 10% , which is typical for observations at this frequency . + for each frequency , seven snapshot observations of two minutes each were taken .",
    "the snapshots were evenly spaced throughout eight hours , to ensure a wide coverage of the uv plane .",
    "the data were reduced using the miriad package using similar techniques described in @xcite .",
    "strong maser emission was used to self - calibrate the data , and allowed data from antenna 6 to be included , greatly reducing the synthesised beam to 1.19@xmath9 2.75 .",
    "the initial mopra observations showed maser emission detected at velocities from 48 to + 286kms@xmath1 , as shown in the bottom spectrum of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this emission comprises of eleven individual maser spots .",
    "followup observations with the atca ( top spectrum in figure [ fig1 ] ) showed emission spanning a larger velocity range from 109 to + 289kms@xmath1  and comprising of 32 individual maser spots .",
    "the greater number of maser spots identified in the atca observations appears to be a result of the lower noise level in the atca spectrum , allowing weaker spots to be identified .",
    "however , intrinsic variablility of the masers has resulted in some brighter spots in the atca observations .",
    "this variability has taken place over 125 days and is most noticeable in the velocity range of + 40 to + 80kms@xmath1 , where the brightest emission occurs in the atca spectrum .",
    "+    o  maser spectra for oh  009.10.4 .",
    "the bottom spectrum was taken using the mopra radiotelescope .",
    "the top spectrum is combined data from three bandpasses using the atca and was taken approximately 125 days after the mopra spectrum .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents the systemic velocity of 87kms@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines in the upper ( atca ) spectrum show 10@xmath9 the solid line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    some overlap in the atca bandpasses allowed us to observe the same maser spots between 50 and 12kms@xmath1  on different nights . based on the two brightest maser spots ( @xmath101jy ) within this range ( at 21.8 and 47.7kms@xmath1 )",
    ", we find an absolute offset of not more than 1.9  between the observations made on different nights .",
    "we note that the weather on the second night of observations was considerably worse than the first night , with significantly higher phase noise .",
    "the second nights observations covered maser spots in the velocity range 12kms@xmath1  to 109kms@xmath1 . thus , we expect absolute positional data for the majority of maser spots , observed on the first night , to be better than 1.9 .",
    "we use the brightest maser spot in the spectrum ( based on integrated intensity , rather than the peak ) as the reference position of our observations , which is at 18@xmath1107@xmath1220@xmath1385 21@xmath816@xmath1412@xmath150 ( j2000 ) .",
    "+ with the small atca synthesised beam , we are able to accurately determine relative positions of each maser spot . for each maser spot , we integrated all channels showing emission , avoiding any channels which might be confused by emission from other spots .",
    "the resultant integrated image was fitted with a two - dimensional gaussian , using the `` imfit '' routine in miriad . for each maser spot , this allows us to determine its relative position more accurately than the beam size .",
    "we estimate the relative positional uncertainty of each maser spot as @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the synthesised beam ( 1.19@xmath9 2.75 ) and snr is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "+    o  maser spots in oh  009.10.4 .",
    "each maser spot is coloured according to their line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the error bars on each maser spot represent the estimated relative positional uncertainty based on the synthesised beam width and the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "positions are given relative to the strongest maser spot , which is located at 18@xmath1107@xmath1220@xmath1385 21@xmath816@xmath1412@xmath150 ( j2000 ) and occurs at a velocity of 53.1kms@xmath1 .",
    "red and blue ellipses indicate the offset and extent of the high velocity red- and blue - shifted components.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have detected h@xmath0o  maser emission over a radial velocity range of 398kms@xmath1  which we believe is the largest of any known water fountain , or indeed any maser source in our galaxy .",
    "based on the available information , we are unable to determine the orientation of this system with respect to the line of sight",
    ". if the orientation is not along the line of sight , the spread of maser velocities will be even greater .",
    "for example , if the orientation is 45@xmath8 to the line of sight , the masers will cover a velocity range of over 560kms@xmath1  in three dimensional space .",
    "this can be compared to recent observations of the water fountain iras 163423814 @xcite , whose radial velocities are measured over a spread of 270kms@xmath1  and whose three dimensional velocities range up to 370kms@xmath1 , based on an inclination angle of 45@xmath8 .",
    "thus , if oh  009.10.4 has a large inclination angle , it shows maser velocities far in excess of any other known water fountain .",
    "alternately , it may be aligned close to the line of sight with a three dimensional velocity slightly larger than that of iras 163423814 .    based on the systemic velocity of the post - agb star of 87kms@xmath1  @xcite , the highest velocity spots of the h@xmath0o  maser spectrum are at 196 and + 202kms@xmath1  along the line of sight , relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the velocity difference of the most redshifted maser spot to the systemic velocity closely matches the magnitude of the velocity difference between the most blueshifted component and the systemic velocity .",
    "in addition to this , we find 8 out of 13 maser spots ( 60% ) on the redshifted side have maser spot counterparts on the blueshifted side with similar magnitudes of velocity offset from the systemic velocity .",
    "such mirroring of the maser emission could be a result of symmetries between each lobe of a bipolar jet .",
    "+ figure [ fig2 ] shows the relative positions of the brightest 24 maser spots , together with their error bars .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , all the emission is found within a small area of @xmath2 .",
    "however , we do see significant differences between the positions of some maser spots .",
    "we assume a kinematic distance to oh  009.10.4 of 6.4kpc @xcite .",
    "thus , the maser spots are confined to a projected area of @xmath18au .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig2 ] , the h@xmath0o maser morphology of oh  009.10.4 does not resemble the distinct bipolar structures characteristic of the imaged water fountain sources .",
    "although there is a offset of @xmath19 ( corresponding to @xmath20  au ) between the most red- and blue - shifted maser features , the opening angle of the outflow of oh  009.10.4 appears to be much larger than that of the collimated jet of the typical water fountain sources .",
    "however , this could be due to projection effect when the source is observed almost along the outflow ( ` jet ' ) axis . assuming a regular bipolar outflow structure , the opening angle of the oh  009.10.4 outflow is given by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the inclination angle of the outflow axis from the line - of - sight . ignoring any possible contributions from jet precession",
    "as observed for w43a @xcite , a typical water fountain opening angle @xmath23 implies @xmath24 .",
    "we can also use the projected separation to estimate the dynamical age of the high velocity outflow from oh  009.10.4 . again assuming a regular bipolar outflow with constant velocity",
    ", the dynamical age @xmath25  yr . while a dynamical age as low as 10  yr can not be excluded , a more typical water fountain age of @xmath26  yr @xcite also implies a small inclination angle .",
    "thus , the high velocity h@xmath0o masers around oh  009.10.4 either originate from a typical water fountain jet observed almost along the jet axis , or they occur in an extremely young and fast wide - angled wind .",
    "these different scenarios can be directly tested by astrometric monitoring at very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) resolution , as a regular outflow implies proper motions of @xmath27  mas  yr@xmath1 for the high velocity h@xmath0o maser components .",
    "contrary to the other water fountain sources , the strongest h@xmath0o maser emission of oh  009.10.4 originates from within @xmath28kms@xmath1  of the stellar velocity . while the spatial extent and velocity of these masers are fairly typical for the standard agb h@xmath0o maser shells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , figure [ fig2 ] shows that the low velocity emission at the blue- and red - shifted sides of the spectrum also arises in separated regions .",
    "although high resolution observations are needed to properly probe the relation between the high- and low - velocity components , the emission could arise in an @xmath29kms@xmath1  equatorial wind as observed at somewhat lower velocities ( @xmath30kms@xmath1 ) in the water fountain sources iras  182860959 and iras  184600151 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the low - velocity components are excited in a slow wind or in accelerating material further down the fast outflow , possibly due to episodic ejections .",
    "we have observed the water fountain oh  009.10.4 with both the mopra and atca radiotelescopes .",
    "we find water maser spots covering an unprecedented velocity range of 398kms@xmath1  which we believe is the largest range of velocities for any known maser site in our galaxy . using the atca interferometer ,",
    "we have partially resolved the water maser emission , which covers a projected area of @xmath18au . from our current observations , it is not clear if the water fountain is aligned along the line of sight , or if it is inclined . if it is aligned along the line of sight , then this orientation offers a unique perspective on water fountains with the jet pointed towards us .",
    "if it is inclined to the line of sight , then the three dimensional velocities will be even larger than measured here .",
    "either way , oh  009.10.4 is certainly a unique and interesting water fountain , worthy of further investigation .",
    "+ we suggest that followup observations oh  009.10.4 at higher spatial resolution , such as with vlbi , will be able to tell us more about the nature of this region .",
