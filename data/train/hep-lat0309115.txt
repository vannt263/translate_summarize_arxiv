    "the potential of three heavy quarks has recently been the object of detailed numerical studies @xcite , which lend support to the so - called y law , inspired by a string picture of heavy baryons . here , we study the leading effect of string fluctuations on the potential , the analogue of the lscher term @xcite in the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "understanding such corrections to the y law is particularly important since the transition from @xmath0 to y law occurs at large quark separations @xcite .",
    "we study three static quarks in a @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space with periodic euclidean time extent @xmath2 . the potential is obtained from the @xmath3 limit , @xmath4    in the string picture , the classical ground state of the three - quark system",
    "is given by three strings meeting at a junction , whose position is determined by the requirement of minimal total length of the strings .",
    "the balance of tensions implies angles of @xmath5 between the strings .",
    "the classical potential is proportional to the total length of the strings in this configuration , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the same string tension that appears in the mesonic potential .",
    "@xmath8 represents the self - energy of the junction .    following the mesonic case @xcite",
    ", we shall expand the action to second order in the transverse fluctuations @xmath9 of the string world sheets @xmath10 around the classical configuration .",
    "transversality means @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a spatial unit vector in the direction of string @xmath14 . with @xmath15 denoting the position of the fluctuating junction , the boundary conditions are@xmath16 where @xmath17 , and periodic in @xmath18 .",
    "invariance under euclidean transformations inside the plane of the sheet and perpendicular to it fixes the leading term in a derivative expansion of the bulk string action to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the domain of @xmath21 implied by the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "we also include a boundary term , @xmath22 the change of area caused by fluctuations of the junction in the plane of a given sheet cancels in the sum over sheets .",
    "the three - quark potential including leading fluctuation effects can thus be extracted from the partition function @xmath23",
    "we shall compute @xmath24 in two steps . for fixed @xmath25 ,",
    "each of the string partition functions , @xmath26 splits into a minimal - area and a fluctuation part , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is harmonic and satisfies ( [ eq : bc ] ) and the determinant is computed with dirichlet boundary conditions on the domain @xmath29 .    to leading order in @xmath25 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the fourier components of @xmath15 .",
    "this implies @xmath32 which is the change in minimal area due to @xmath33 .",
    "the determinant induces a renormalisation of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . after applying a pauli  villars regularisation , the determinant , which can be expressed in terms of the heat kernel of @xmath0 ,",
    "can be computed by mapping the domain @xmath20 conformally to a rectangle @xmath34 .",
    "since the conformal map can not change the ratio @xmath35 ( the modular parameter of the cylinder ) , one has to choose @xmath36 .",
    "to leading order in @xmath25 , the conformal map is @xmath37 following ref .",
    "@xcite , the determinant on @xmath20 can be related to that on the rectangle , and one finds @xmath38 where @xmath39 is dedekind s function .",
    "the gaussian integral over @xmath25 in ( [ eq : zqqq ] ) can now be performed and @xmath40 be extracted from the limit @xmath3 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : vqqq ] ) .",
    "one obtains : @xmath41     \\ ; , \\notag\\\\    \\mskip-36mu    v_{1/l}^\\perp & = { -\\frac{\\pi}{24 } \\sum_{a}\\frac{1}{l_{a } } }    \\notag\\\\    & \\mskip12mu + \\int\\limits_0^{\\infty}\\!\\frac{{{\\mathrm{d}}}\\omega}{2\\pi } \\ln \\biggl [    \\tfrac13 \\sum_{{a } } { \\coth(\\omega l_{a } ) }    \\biggr ]    \\;.",
    "\\label{eq : result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have separated contributions from fluctuations in the plane of the three quarks , @xmath42 , and perpendicular to it , @xmath43 . note that both expressions are homogeneous in @xmath44 , representing exactly the @xmath45 term .",
    "as a check , we can ( artificially ) split the string connecting a quark and an antiquark into two sections of length @xmath46 and @xmath47 , pretending there is a junction in between .",
    "the mass of the junction should not affect the large-@xmath48 behaviour , and we should recover the known result . in this case , there is no contribution @xmath42 and the integral in @xmath43 becomes @xmath49     \\\\",
    "= \\frac{\\pi}{24 }    \\left ( \\frac{1}{l_1 } + \\frac{1}{l_2 } - \\frac{1}{l_1+l_2 }    \\right )     \\;,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which just corrects the lscher terms of the two string sections into that of the full string .",
    "the following special cases reveal interesting consequences of our result . in the equilateral case ,",
    "@xmath50 , it so happens that the fluctuations in the plane do not contribute .",
    "those perpendicular to it yield @xmath51 this means that there is no @xmath52 term in @xmath53 .    expanding about the equilateral case ,",
    "@xmath54 with @xmath55 , one finds @xmath56 so in @xmath53 , the @xmath52 term is positive",
    ". this makes @xmath40 non - concave as a function of the scale @xmath48 for fixed angles between the quarks .",
    "this is actually true for all geometries , not just almost equilateral ones .",
    "[ fig:3d ] shows a density plot of @xmath57 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) , as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for fixed @xmath58 . in @xmath59 ,",
    "the @xmath52 term is always negative , so @xmath40 is concave .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory were performed in @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath40 was extracted from polyakov loop correlators using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite on a @xmath60 lattice with lattice spacing @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , for one qqq geometry .",
    "the deviation from a pure y law ( with the measured mesonic string tension ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .    the asymptotic y law is clearly approached _ from above _ as predicted , making the potential non - concave , but the magnitude of the @xmath52 term appears too large : @xmath63 compared to a coefficient of @xmath64 as predicted by eq .  (",
    "[ eq : result ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to the small quark separations : even for the largest geometries , the shortest string in the classical configuration is only @xmath65 long , so the string picture is hardly applicable .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the numerical result is very sensitive to the estimate of the mesonic string tension .",
    "finally , a mandatory extrapolation to @xmath3 has not been performed yet , so that excited - state contributions may significantly affect the measured coefficient .",
    "a more thorough check of the string predictions should also include other geometries .",
    "finally , it would be very interesting to extend the calculation to larger @xmath66 gauge groups and compare with predictions from @xmath67 expansions .",
