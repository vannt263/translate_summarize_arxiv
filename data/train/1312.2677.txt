    "recently , topological classification for generic symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors was given by schnyder et al .",
    "@xcite and kitaev  @xcite . depending on the presence and properties of generic symmetries , namely the time - reversal and particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "ten symmetry classes can be identified , and for each of them depending on the space dimensionality , topological classification gives an integer invariant ( @xmath1 ) , a binary invariant ( @xmath2 ) , or no invariant ( only trivial , ` non - topological ' insulators in this class ) .",
    "one example of a topological insulator is provided by the time reversal invariant b - phase of superfluid helium-3 , which belongs to the diii symmetry class ; a hamiltonian in this class respects time - reversal and particle - hole symmetries  @xcite ( see section  [ subsec : classgen ] ) . in thin films of superfluid @xmath0he the time - reversal invariant planar phase  @xcite can become stable . in this phase ,",
    "the superfluid gap , isotropic in the b - phase , is anisotropic and vanishes for the direction , transverse to the film .",
    "nevertheless , in 2d this system is gapful ( ` insulating ' ) .",
    "while this phase has not been identified experimentally yet , in recent experiments  @xcite strong suppression of the transverse gap has been observed .",
    "the planar phase has an extra discrete symmetry , a combination of spin and phase rotations , which may modify the topological classification , adding extra topological invariants . in this paper",
    ", we set out to provide the topological classification of insulators with this additional symmetry .",
    "we are partially motivated by the above - mentioned experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , it is also interesting to see how additional symmetries modify the results for one of the ten classes .",
    "although in principle additional ( to time and charge reversal ) unitary symmetries can be dealt with in the altland - zirnbauer ( az ) approach ( cf .  ref .  ) , we also want to understand the relevant topology and topological invariants directly in the explicit language of the homotopy theory , that is by analyzing the homotopy equivalence of relevant mappings ( cf .  ref .  ) .",
    "this allows one to identify a topological class from the analysis of the topology of the band structure ( in the case of no disorder ) in the bulk .",
    "such direct view is also of interest for the basic ten classes .",
    "we begin with similar analysis for the b - phase ( that is for the diii symmetry class ) and reproduce the known results .",
    "the topological classification of topological insulators in class diii in @xmath3 dimensions is rederived , again in the explicit language of homotopy topology .",
    "we then account for the additional symmetry of the planar phase and modify the classification accordingly .",
    "the classification for the planar - phase symmetry in 2d is discussed , for which volovik and yakovenko give an integer ( @xmath1 ) topological invariant in ref .  .    an extra motivation to study this particular case of the planar phase",
    "is that we use it to construct a dimensional reduction for general class - diii topological superconductors .",
    "we show that the topological properties of a 3d system and an embedded ( 2 + 1)d system , which exist in any time - reversal invariant cross section of the momentum space , are connected . as an application of such a reduction",
    "we derive a generalized index theorem for 3d topological superconductors , which provides an example of the bulk - boundary correspondence in odd spatial dimensions .",
    "we consider here a particular additional symmetry , which is realized in the planar phase .",
    "this is a combination of a @xmath4 spin rotation around some axis followed by a @xmath5 phase rotation .",
    "this symmetry is satisfied in superfluid @xmath0he , in which the spin - orbit interaction is very weak , but not necessarily in other materials .",
    "nevertheless , the method of dimensional reduction , discussed below , can be applied to other classes of topological superconductors and insulators with various additional exact or approximate symmetries , such as the point symmetry groups in crystals , cf .  refs .  , and pseudo - spin rotations in graphene .",
    "our considerations of the planar - phase symmetry are based on those for the diii symmetry class , defined below , and we begin with the latter case .",
    "we consider non - interacting translationally invariant systems .",
    "this allows us to characterize the system by a single - particle bloch hamiltonian @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath6 is a mapping from the momentum space to the space of hamiltonians with certain constraints , depending on symmetry .",
    "this is easily extended to interacting systems using the green - function formalism , the effective hamiltonian being given by the green function at zero frequency , see , e.g. , ref .  . with such constraints ,",
    "topologically ( homotopically ) non - equivalent mappings are possible , and the goal of topological classification is to provide a complete list of the equivalence classes of such mappings ( two mappings are considered equivalent  homotopic  if they can be continuously transformed to each other ) . in order to deal with the topology of the mappings ,",
    "let us first discuss their properties in more detail .    in a completely translationally invariant @xmath7-dimensional system",
    "@xmath8 runs over the infinite momentum space . in the latter case for a spherically symmetric system ( @xmath0he - b ) at @xmath9",
    "the hamiltonian has a fixed matrix form ( up to an inessential positive constant ; cf .",
    "[ sec : bbint ] ) , and this allows one to compactify the momentum space by identifying all the points at @xmath9 to a single point , which reduces the @xmath7-dimensional momentum space @xmath10 to a sphere @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , in a system with discrete translational symmetry ( a periodic crystal , a topological band insulator ) , the ( quasi-)momentum space is the brillouin zone ( bz ) , which is a @xmath7-dimensional torus , @xmath12 .",
    "however , if we disregard the so called weak topological invariants and focus only on the strong topological invariants robust to disorder  @xcite , one can again replace @xmath12 by a sphere @xmath11 by gluing together all point at the bz boundary .",
    "thus , below we consider mappings from the @xmath7-dimensional ` spherical brillouin zone ' @xmath13 .",
    "below , we sometimes use the ` spherical ' language , assuming that @xmath14 is the north pole , and @xmath15 ( or the boundary of bz ) corresponds to the south pole .",
    "we further assume that opposite points , @xmath16 , correspond to the points on the opposite ends of a same - latitude line ( that is differ by a @xmath4-rotation about the @xmath17-axis ) .",
    "further , the properties of the mapping are fixed by the conditions that the hamiltonian is hermitian , non - degenerate ( i.e. has no zero energy eigenvalues , a gapful spectrum ) and by the symmetry constraints . in class diii of the ten - fold altland - zirnbauer classification@xcite ( see refs .   for a summary and further references ) , the system  the bogolyubov - de - gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian in the case of our current interest  possesses two symmetries , which are the time reversal and charge conjugation .",
    "we consider a @xmath18-dimensional space of states ( we show below that increasing this dimensionality does not modify the result ) .",
    "this corresponds to the spin and two bogolyubov indices , each taking one of two values ; below we use the pauli matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 for these indices , respectively . in our notations below the bdg hamiltonian",
    "has the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a spin - symmetric and momentum - odd matrix ( triplet pairing ) of the superfluid order parameter , while @xmath23 is the spectrum of excitations in the normal state , e.g. , @xmath24 .",
    "the simplest form of @xmath22 for @xmath0he - b and the planar phase is @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath27 . the time - reversal symmetry ( trs )",
    "implies that @xmath28 ( we follow the notations of schnyder et al .",
    "@xcite ) the charge - conjugation symmetry ( or particle - hole symmetry , phs ) also relates @xmath6 and @xmath29 , specifically , @xmath30 . since trs and phs are antiunitary symmetries , for convenience we use their combination , which basically constrains the structure of @xmath6 at each @xmath8 ( a chiral symmetry ) : @xmath31 that is @xmath6 anticommutes with @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that @xmath6 is block - off - diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath32 , and thus it is completely defined by its block @xmath33 above the diagonal ( the block below the diagonal being @xmath34 , cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "equivalently and more specifically , one easily finds from eq .",
    "( [ cond : trs - phs ] ) that @xmath35 is a real linear combination of 8 ( instead of the initial 16 ) terms : @xmath36 .",
    "then , the trs relates the values of these coefficients at @xmath8 and @xmath37 : the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 in front of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the same , while the other six change sign .",
    "it is convenient to combine these eight real numbers , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath7 , @xmath45 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath46 into the following matrix : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . then the condition that @xmath35 is gapped ( @xmath52 or , equivalently , @xmath53 ) reads @xmath54 and the phs maps @xmath55 .",
    "thus , our problem reduces to finding the classes of topologically equivalent mappings @xmath56 with the property @xmath57 we refer to this property by saying that the mapping @xmath33 is _",
    "odd_.    it is useful to further simplify the problem by reducing ( continuously tightening ) @xmath58 to @xmath59 in a standard manner .",
    "namely , each @xmath60 can be uniquely presented as a product @xmath61 of a unitary @xmath62 and a positive hermitian @xmath63 ( polar decomposition )",
    ". then @xmath63 can be ( e.g. , linearly ) retracted to the identity @xmath64 . formally speaking",
    ", this means that @xmath59 is a deformation retract  @xcite of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we have to classify mappings @xmath65 with @xmath66 ( one can easily check all the details of this reduction ) .",
    "each hamiltonian is described by a unitary @xmath62 , and we have to classify mappings @xmath67 with the proper symmetries . to find the classification , we recall that @xmath68 ; more specifically , each unitary @xmath62 can be presented as a product of a phase factor and a special unitary matrix , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) .",
    "this presentation is not unique , since one can change simultaneously the sign of both terms in the product .",
    "however , if we choose some presentation at one point , say , @xmath14 , we can follow how the phase factor and the matrix @xmath72 vary continuously over the bz .",
    "can be lifted to the covering @xmath73 of @xmath59 ( _ lifting theorem _ ) .",
    "of course , we have to choose the image of one point , say , @xmath74 , between two possibilities , but after that the covering mapping is uniquely defined . ]",
    "if we parameterize @xmath72 with a 4d unit vector @xmath75 as @xmath76 , the symmetry properties of @xmath77 ( the odd parity ) translate in the following : considering @xmath78 , we find that @xmath79 is either equal or opposite to @xmath80 . since they are equal at @xmath14 , we find that @xmath79 is even : @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that @xmath82 is odd , which means that @xmath83 are odd and @xmath84 is even : @xmath85    hence we have to classify mappings @xmath86 and @xmath87 with these symmetry properties ( [ sodd ] ) .",
    "the first mapping is obviously always topologically trivial because it is even .",
    "the mapping @xmath88 , however , may be nontrivial : because of the symmetry relation ( [ sodd ] ) , the points @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the poles of @xmath89 ) are mapped to @xmath90 .",
    "thus there is a topological @xmath2-invariant that shows _ whether they are mapped to the same or to different points_.    clearly , both values of this invariant can be realized , and this gives a complete classification , that is any odd mappings @xmath91 with the same value of this @xmath2-invariant are homotopic to each other within the class of odd mappings . to see this ,",
    "let us first consider the 1d case of the mapping @xmath92 from a 1d sphere ( a circle ) .",
    "in this case one can consider the mapping of one half of @xmath93 between the north and south poles : ( i ) in the even case ( with the zero @xmath2-invariant ) this can be contracted to its initial point , and the other half gets contracted as well by the odd symmetry ; hence the mapping is topologically trivial ; ( ii ) in the odd case ( @xmath2-invariant 1 ) this half starts at one pole of @xmath94 and ends at the other , and it can be deformed to any standard path between the poles ( e.g. , a meridian line ) , and the other half gets deformed by symmetry to the other half of the meridian ; hence all odd mappings can be deformed to each other continuously .",
    "a similar consideration can be found in the next section in more detail .",
    "going to the 2d case , one can imagine cutting @xmath89 by a meridian circle in two hemispheres , thinking of this circle as the 1d bz . by first deforming",
    "this 1d bz as above , and then gluing to it the two 2d halves of the 2-sphere , we arrive at the conclusion above .",
    "notice , however , that by going to @xmath95 and using the same procedure , one finds out that the 3d hemispheres of @xmath96 can be attached to the 2d frame in many topologically different ways , described by the degree of the mapping .",
    "thus we can see that in this case the ( integer ) degree of the mapping @xmath97 is the only topological invariant . in summary , in agreement with refs .",
    "we find for class diii a @xmath2-invariant in 1d and 2d and a @xmath1-invariant in 3d .",
    "let us also remark that if in addition we assert that far away from the fermi surface ( i.e. , ` far above and deep inside the fermi sea ' ) the hamiltonian is dominated by the normal - state part @xmath98 , so that we fix also the images of @xmath99 in @xmath100 ( to @xmath101 ) , then we have an additional @xmath1-invariant that tells us , how many ` half - times ' the image of @xmath102 encircles @xmath100 . in other words , this invariant is given by the winding number of @xmath103 along an arbitrary path from @xmath74 to @xmath15 , which is @xmath104 .",
    "as we have discussed in the introduction , the planar phase of superfluid @xmath0he has an extra symmetry as compared to @xmath0he - b .",
    "while in the bulk helium-3 only a- and b - phases are known to be stable ( in zero magnetic field ) , the planar phase may be stabilized in thin films . in recent experiments",
    "@xcite indications of the strongly distorted b - phase were found , and the planar phase may become observable too . as estimated in ref .  , the superfluid gap , which is isotropic in the b - phase in the bulk , becomes anisotropic in the films with the gap in the transverse direction suppressed by a factor of about 0.4 .",
    "( color online ) the mappings @xmath38 , analyzed for classification of the planar - phase symmetry class , are from the brillouin zone ( bz ) , compactified to a sphere @xmath13 with the poles at @xmath74 and @xmath15 , to the sphere @xmath105 ( see text ) .",
    "the mappings are odd : the images @xmath106 and @xmath107 on @xmath105 are related by a @xmath4 rotation around the ( vertical ) axis . (",
    "a ) the 1d bz  a circle .",
    "for the zero value of the @xmath2 invariant both poles of bz are mapped to the same pole of @xmath105 . in this case",
    "@xmath38 can be continuously deformed to the trivial mapping , which maps the whole circle to one point .",
    "indeed , the image of one semicircle ( blue solid line ) can be continuously contracted to the pole as indicated by the arrow ; the other semicircle ( red dashed line ) is contracted at the same time , because the mapping is odd .",
    "( b ) the 2d bz , a sphere , presented as a 1d frame ( 0 and @xmath108 meridians ) and two hemispheres .",
    "for the zero @xmath2 invariant , the 1d frame is contracted to a point ( dashed arrows ) .",
    "then the image of one hemisphere covers @xmath105 an integer number of times ( once in the figure ) , and for an odd mapping the other hemisphere  the same number of times , giving an even degree in total .",
    "( c ) for the non - zero @xmath2 invariant the two poles of bz are mapped to two different poles of @xmath105 .",
    "then the image of one semicircle from the 1d frame ( blue solid line ) can be deformed to a standard path ( zero meridian ) .",
    "the image of each hemisphere in bz covers the same half - integer part of @xmath105 , giving an odd degree in total ( degree one in the figure ) . ]",
    "this motivates us to analyze the topological classification for symmetry classes with ` extra ' symmetries on top of the basic trs and/or phs symmetries . on one hand , this can be analyzed within the general frame of the az approach  @xcite .",
    "however , explicit results for symmetries of interest and especially explicit expressions for respective topological invariants are of great interest ( cf .",
    "the discussion for crystalline solids  @xcite ) .",
    "we analyze the symmetry class of the planar phase , that is the diii class with an extra symmetry described below , and provide a complete classification .",
    "we show below that the @xmath2-invariant , found in the previous section for a 2d class - diii system , survives .",
    "moreover , the complete classification within this symmetry class gives rise to an integer topological invariant , with the @xmath109 invariant being its parity .",
    "we explain these results below in this section .",
    "the additional symmetry of the bdg hamiltonian in the planar phase in our notation is @xmath110 ( that is , @xmath111 ) , @xmath112 and we consider the symmetry class with this additional symmetry constraint . here",
    "@xmath113 is a combined @xmath109 symmetry  a combination of the spin @xmath4-rotation about the @xmath17-axis and the phase rotation by @xmath5 .",
    "note that the single - particle hamiltonian ( and green function ) commute also with the transformations generated by @xmath113 , @xmath114 , which form a continuous @xmath115 symmetry group in similarity , e.g. , to spin rotations about @xmath17 generated by @xmath116 .",
    "this , however , does not impose additional constraints on @xmath35 and hence does not change the topology of these single - particle quantities .",
    "furthermore , the many - body hamiltonian and multi - particle quantities ( e.g. , the two - particle green function ) obey only the discrete , but not the continuous symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonian satisfying ( [ eq : planarphasesymmetry ] ) can be transformed to the off - diagonal form with @xmath117 and thus @xmath118 .",
    "hence @xmath62 is either @xmath119 ( the case of little interest ) or @xmath120 , a spin rotation by @xmath4 around an arbitrary axis @xmath121 .",
    "this second choice provides the nontrivial topology .",
    "we have to classify mappings of the sphere @xmath89 to the sphere @xmath105 that are odd : opposite points are mapped to opposite points , and for both spheres _ opposite _ refers to points , related by a @xmath4-rotation around a specific axis ( the @xmath17-axis for @xmath89 and the @xmath122-axis or @xmath17 .",
    "below we have in mind the @xmath17-axis for both spheres , and refer to its ends as the north and south poles .",
    "] for @xmath105 ) .    in complete analogy with the 3d case for class diii above",
    ", we find that in 2d such mappings are completely classified by the _ degree of the mapping _ , which could assume any integer value .",
    "moreover , whether this value is even or odd , is related to the @xmath2 invariant , defined above .",
    "indeed , both @xmath74 and @xmath15 in bz are mapped to @xmath123 , and the @xmath2 invariant above determines , whether they are mapped to the same or to the opposite points of the @xmath121-sphere . we show below that in the former case the degree is even and in the latter case the degree is odd .    to prove this statement , in analogy to the previous section let us cut the bz - sphere in two halves with a line through @xmath74 and @xmath15 , for instance , with @xmath124 ( equivalently , in the language of spherical bz @xmath89 , with a full meridian circle on the bz - sphere , for instance , the zero and @xmath108-meridians , the blue solid and red dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps]b ) . because of the odd parity the mappings of one hemisphere completely defines the full mapping .",
    "however , the mapping of the hemisphere is constrained at the boundary ( the @xmath125 and @xmath108 meridians )  the opposite points of the boundary , @xmath126 , should be mapped to the opposite points of @xmath105 .",
    "such mappings can always be thought of in the following way : ( i ) we have a mapping of one half - meridian ( say , the @xmath125 meridian ) between the poles to @xmath105 ( with the ends mapped to the same or opposite poles , depending on the @xmath2 invariant ) ; ( ii ) the mapping of the other half - meridian ( @xmath108-meridian ) is determined by the symmetry ( odd parity ) ; ( iii ) and the mapping from the interior of the hemisphere somehow ( arbitrarily ) extends the mapping of the boundary .",
    "first , each mapping of the hemisphere can be continuously deformed under the constraint of odd parity to a simpler mapping . specifically , we can modify continuously the mapping of the half - meridian ( with the mapping fixed at its ends ) , the other half - meridian being modified in accordance with the odd parity .",
    "one can easily see that , because of the odd parity , this modification does not change the total area on @xmath105 covered by the image of the hemisphere in bz ( and again by odd parity , the other hemisphere covers the same area ) .",
    "it is more convenient to describe this modification separately for two possible values of the @xmath2 invariant .    in the case of the zero value of the @xmath2 invariant , when two ends of the zero meridian are mapped to the same pole ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps]a ) , the image of this meridian ( a loop starting and ending at the same pole ) can be continuously deformed to the pole itself . then , the area spanned by the hemisphere is an integer , and the total area covered by the mapping @xmath127 is even .",
    "( note that any integer degree can be realized : to see that , one could just map the whole meridian to the pole . ) in the other case of odd @xmath2 invariant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps]c ) , when two ends of the zero meridian on @xmath89 are mapped to the opposite poles , the image of this meridian can be continuously deformed to ` just a straight line ' , e.g. , to the zero meridian on @xmath105 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps]c",
    ". then , the area spanned by the hemisphere is half - integer , and thus the full sphere @xmath89 covers @xmath105 an odd integer number of times .",
    "thus _ the degree of the mapping is the only invariant_. it can take any integer value .",
    "this value is even , when @xmath74 and @xmath15 are mapped to the same point , and odd , if they are mapped to different ( then opposite ) points .",
    "these two cases correspond to two values of the @xmath2 invariant from the previous section .",
    "a comment is in order on higher - dimensional matrices .",
    "so far we considered the @xmath128-dimensional hilbert space of possible states .",
    "in general , in these symmetry classes we can consider higher(@xmath129)-dimensional spaces , with the 2d bogolyubov - nambu and @xmath130-dimensional ` internal ' space ( spin and other degrees of freedom ) ; large values of @xmath131 pertain to realistic condensed - matter systems  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry conditions for trs , phs , and the extra planar - phase symmetry then look the same as above ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "the anticommutation with @xmath32 again implies the block - off - diagonal form of the hamiltonian , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : det m ] ) , ( [ eq : m - trs ] ) , ( [ eq : m - planar_sym ] ) are valid .",
    "hence , as above we have to classify odd mappings ( [ eq : m - trs ] ) @xmath132 .",
    "the analysis follows the same route as above : for class diii , first , presenting @xmath133 with @xmath134 , we find that the map @xmath135 is always trivial ; as for @xmath136 , each of the poles @xmath137 is mapped to one of the two connected components of antisymmetric matrices from @xmath138 with the pfaffian @xmath139 , and this defines a @xmath2-invariant . as above from direct homotopic - theoretical considerations",

    "similar considerations apply for the planar - phase symmetry class , in this case we again find a @xmath2 classification in 1d and @xmath1 in 2d as opposed to a @xmath2 classification suggested earlier@xcite .",
    "note that this class contains @xmath141 disconnected components : @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) is a hermitian operator with @xmath144 positive and @xmath145 negative eigenvalues , where @xmath144 may vary from @xmath125 to @xmath130 and is related to the signature @xmath146 of the hermitian operator @xmath147 .",
