    "the ratio of binary to single stars on main - sequence is known to vary as a function of spectral type ( abt 1983 ) . in some star forming regions ( sfrs ) , this ratio is known to be in excess of the field star binary frequency ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , however , in other sfrs , it is the same as that of the field stars .",
    "siegler et al . ( 2003 , 2005 ) and burgasser et al . ( 2003 ) find evidence for a decreasing wide binary frequency associated with very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the field .",
    "binary frequency appears to also be a function of the mass ratio , as illustrated , for example , by the differences in the numbers of stellar versus substellar companions to g stars ( e.g. , duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; mazeh et al . 1992 ; marcy & butler 2000 ) . as searches for binary systems",
    "have become more complete , the observational findings create ever more stringent conditions that must be accounted for in any uniform model of star , brown dwarf , and planet formation .",
    "however , because the extent of dynamical evolution is an open question , the most useful observations for constraining binary formation models are those based on the youngest observable stars .",
    "multiplicity surveys of the last decade and a half have shown a surprising diversity of visual binary frequency in nearby star forming regions ( ghez et al .",

    "2003 ; ratzka et al .",
    "the differences appear to result from the influence of initial conditions in these regions on the frequency of binary formation ( mathieu et al .",

    "; covey et al . 2006 ; joergens 2006 ; kurosawa et al . 2006 ) for stellar and substellar companions are just beginning to produce results . some of these next generation surveys are larger in scope and some are higher in precision than previous work .",
    "large , complete surveys drawn from consistent samples are not yet available but will provide extremely useful input for theorists studying binary and planet formation ( e.g. , delgado - donate et al . 2004 ; boss 2006 ) .",
    "besides extending our knowledge of young star multiplicity to very low masses , spectroscopic binaries are important in their own right .",
    "such systems allow precise determination of dynamical properties such as the mass function ( for single - lined systems , sb1s ) , the mass ratio ( for double - lined systems , sb2s ) , and ultimately component masses ( for sb2s which are eclipsing or have angularly resolved orbits , yielding orbital inclination ) .",
    "mass is the single most important stellar property from which , given the metallicity , all other properties of an object may be derived .",
    "accurate masses are necessary to calibrate the theoretical pre@xmath0main - sequence ( pms ) evolutionary tracks ( simon et al . 2000 ;",
    "hillenbrand & white 2004 ) , particularly at low masses where there is significant scatter in models and very few objects with known masses ( white et al .",
    "1999 ; prato et al .",
    "2002a ; torres & ribas 2002 ; stassun et al .",
    "furthermore , mass ratio distributions and secondary mass distributions provide additional input to theories of binary formation .",
    "thus , the identification of young spectroscopic binaries is extremely useful .",
    "young m stars are of particular interest in that they are the most common stellar spectral type in most star forming regions , including ophiuchus , regardless of where exactly the mass function turns over near the substellar boundary ( e.g. , luhman et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "there are very few young , low - mass sb2s known .",
    "only 12.9% of the 31 sb2s listed in prato et al .",
    "( 2002a ) have primary masses less than 1 solar mass .",
    "although additional pms sb2s have been discovered since 2002 , the small percentage of sub - solar mass systems prevails .",
    "the reason for this bias is natural : surveying low - mass stars in sfrs with minimum distances of @xmath1140  pc , and therefore relatively faint magnitudes , is impractical at 1@xmath03  m class telescopes where most of the radial velocity studies of young stars have been conducted with visible light spectrometers .",
    "furthermore , radial velocity surveys for long - period systems , or for systems with very low - mass companions , require long time series observations .",
    "the 8@xmath010  m class telescopes have only been fully equiped and commissioned in the last 5@xmath010 years , therefore work of this nature has only recently become possible .",
    "my colleagues and i have developed a powerful approach to the study of sbs using high - resolution infrared spectroscopy ( prato 1998 ; steffen et al .",

    "low - mass primary stars emit most of their radiant energy at wavelengths @xmath31  @xmath4 m .",
    "also , because luminosity scales as a steeper function of mass in the @xmath5-band than , for example , in the @xmath6-band , it is easier to detect faint , low - mass secondary stars in the blended spectra of sbs at longer wavelengths .",
    "finally , the lower amplitude of star spot modulated fluctuations in the infrared compared to visible light also favors longer wavelength observations ( carpenter et al .",
    "it is simply most efficient to search for young m star spectroscopic binaries with a large aperture telescope in the infrared .",
    "this paper describes the initial results from a radial velocity survey of a homogeneous sample of m stars in the ophiuchus sfr with infrared observations at the keck ii 10-m telescope .",
    "the goal was to find young m star spectroscopic binaries in ophiuchus by searching for radial velocity variability and to measure the mass ratios of any new systems discovered .",
    "two sb2s , two sb1s , and one radial velocity variable were found .",
    "the results presented are preliminary in this first report ; because the phase coverage is sparse , it is only possible at this point to measure mass ratios .",
    "determination of the periods and other orbital elements will require intensive followup .",
    "a natural outcome of observing with a large aperture telescope located at a site with good seeing was the additional , serendipitous discovery of a number of close , visual binaries . in  2",

    "this is not a complete sample ; seven k6 and k7 stars and five m stars from martn et al . were not observed .",

    "martn et al .",
    "determined youth and membership with li  6708  measurements .",
    "i originally chose 31 m star targets in 28 fields ; several fields around the coordinates given in martn et al .",

    "in one such field ( rx  j1625.2@xmath02455 ) , two spectra taken of the fainter object , `` b '' in table 1 of martn et al .",

    "thus the final number of unresolved objects surveyed in this paper is 33 , located in 30 distinct systems .",
    "four of these are classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) , 24 are weak - lined t  tauri stars ( wtts ) , and 5 are post - t  tauri stars ( ptts ) , according to the classification of martn et al . among the distinct regions within ophiuchus described in martn et al . , i selected 2 targets from the `` streamers '' , 12 from the `` @xmath10 oph core '' , 7 from `` r7 '' , and 12 from the `` smoke rings '' ( see martn et al .",

    "the fei and oh features at @xmath11.563@xmath4 m are especially useful in the determination of spectral types . in order to assign spectral types to the targets and to thereby determine which templates to use for radial velocity measurements , i reordered the sequence of m0 to m4 templates to show a logical progression of fei and oh features .",

    "prato et al .",
    "( 2002b ) also note this mismatch .",
    "this discrepancy is likely the result of a number of factors .",
    "the visible and infrared light spectra do not necessarily sample the same regions in the m star atmospheres .",

    "dispersion solutions were derived from oh night sky emission lines for all spectra ; these are very well distributed across order 49 , the central order at this setting .",
    "another advantage of order 49 is the relative lack of telluric absorption lines in the region .",

    "the redspec package , software designed at ucla by s. kim , l. prato , and i. mclean specifically for the analysis of nirspec data , was used for all reductions .",
    "the observational set up and data reduction procedures followed were identical to those described in prato et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "this is true for both target stars as well as the spectral type template stars used in the analysis here .",
    "although most of the template stars were observed on runs in 2000@xmath02001 during which nirspec was used in conjunction with the keck ii adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( prato et al . ; mazeh et al .",

    "( 1998 ) ( using moderate resolution , visible light spectroscopy ) by up to 2 spectral classes . however , most typically agree to within 1 spectral class with martn et al.s results .",
    "radial velocities were measured for the targets by cross - correlating each spectrum of a particular target against the closest matching template , rotationally broadened to the best fit @xmath14sin@xmath15 .",
    "rotational broadening of the template spectra was accomplished using routines developed by c. bender ( priv .",
    "comm . ) , following gray ( 1992 ) with the limb - darkening law of claret ( 2000 ) .",

    "the cross - correlation peaks were fit with gaussian functions to determine the radial velocities .",
    "the uncertainty in velocity measurements depends in part on how well it is possible to measure the radial velocities of the template standard stars with nirspec . for the template library used here ,",
    "the systematic uncertainty was estiamted at @xmath11  km  s@xmath2 ( prato et al . 2002a ; mazeh et al . 2003 ) .",
    "column ( 8) of table  1 shows the average radial velocities measured for each young star target in this sample and column ( 9 ) provides the rms scatter for each object , @xmath16 .",
    "the average @xmath16 for the 30 objects in table  1 with more than one velocity measurement , excluding the two obvious sb2s , is 0.90  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "all objects with @xmath16 greater than about five times this average are defined as sbs .",
    "i categorize one object with @xmath17  km  s@xmath2 as radial velocity variable .",
    "if the two sb1s , the radial velocity variable , and roxr1 31 , for which the observed signal to noise ratio was rather low for one epoch ( see  4.3.6 ) , are also removed from the calculation , the average @xmath16 is 0.43  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "i therefore define the _ internal _ uncertainty in the radial velocity variability measurements as 0.43  km  s@xmath2 .    in table 1 , each of the 33 targets observed individually for spectroscopic multiplicity is listed separately .",
    "there are two sb2s , 2 sb1s , and one radial velocity variable .",
    "the primary star velocities for the sb1s and the radial velocity variable appear in table 3 .",
    "for the sbs , both the primary and secondary star velocities , along with the mass ratios and center of mass velocities , are given in table 3 ( see also  4.3 ) .",
    "the spectral types for the sb2s were derived from the spectra taken during minimum radial velocity difference between the components .",
    "this was the orbital configuration when the first spectrum was taken for both sb2s ; thus , both initially appeared single . because the mass ratios are both close to unity , the spectral types are are unlikely to differ by more than one spectral class . assuming that all of the newly discovered sb pairs presented here have equal flux ratios , if angularly resolved , none of the primary stars magnitudes would fall below @xmath1811.1 , the magnitude of the faintest object in the survey .",
    "thus , there is no bias towards inclusion of binaries in the sample based on brightness .",
    "the excellent seeing often afforded on mauna kea revealed that a number of the systems studied here have close visual companions , identified by inspection of the scam images .",
    "greene & young s ( 1992 ) study of infrared sources in the @xmath10  oph core region showed that the surface density of background _ field stars _ , appearing in the same region as the young stars with k magnitudes of @xmath1913 , is 0.07 per square arcminute , or 1.9@xmath1210@xmath20 field stars per square arcsecond . for m stars ,",
    "the @xmath21 colors are at most @xmath10.3 mag , so @xmath22-band data are an adequate surrogate for @xmath6-band observations . assuming a similar contamination surface density in all of the ophiuchus sub - regions i surveyed ,",
    "there is a 72% chance of one interloper within 20@xmath8 of the 30 systems observed and an 18% chance of an interloper within 10@xmath8 .",
    "the probability of a subarcsecond interloper is @xmath191% for the 30 systems on the whole .",
    "the contamination from the denser distribution of _ young _ stars in the @xmath10  oph core is 3.4 times greater than from field stars .",
    "thus the chance for a superposition of a young star within 10@xmath8 of one of the target stars is 63% .",
    "i therefore adopt a 10@xmath8 upper limit for a probable physical binary companion , consistent with that used by simon et al .",
    "given that the r7 , streamers , and smoke ring regions are probably less dense than the @xmath10  oph core region , this is likely an upper limit on the young star contamination probability .    in total",
    ", i discovered five visual binary systems with separations of @xmath11@xmath8 or less , all located in the smoke rings and r7 . for three of these pairs it was possible to take individual spectra of both components (  3 ) , hence the 33 individual , unresolved objects surveyed for radial velocity variability .",
    "the separations of the other two subarcsecond binaries were too small to obtain spectra of each component without nirspec behind the ao system ( comments , table 1 ) .",
    "there are two targets with companions between 1@xmath8 and 10@xmath8 ; in one case a fainter , presumably later type star is @xmath17@xmath8 away from rx  j1613.8@xmath01835 , and in the other , an f star is located just under 10@xmath8 from rx  1621.4@xmath02332 ( vrba et al . 1993 ) .",

    "i have therefore classified it as an m1 . a recent low - dispersion , visible light spectrum is consistent with this classification ( f. walter , priv . comm . ) .",
    "in addition to making the spectral type classification more difficult , broad absorption lines can complicate cross - correlation and yield less precise measurements of radial velocity .",
    "the four radial velocities measured for rx  j1628.0@xmath02448 appear in table 3 . in order to investigate the possibility that their variability is the result of poor measurement precision resulting from broad spectral lines",

    "there were no measurements of identical velocities made close in time to provide additional information .      despite the anomalous rms scatter in the 3 radial velocity measurements of this system ,",

    "although a follow - up measurement of this target will be important to conclusively rule out radial velocity variability , this is likely an example of the loss of precision associated with poor signal to noise observations .      excluding the four sbs , the radial velocity variable , and the object observed only on one occasion ( rx  j1612.6 - 1924ee )",

    "the average radial velocities of the three sub - regions studied here , in which more than 2 stars were observed , are also statistically indistinguishable from the overall average .",
    "this implies , as underscored in kurosawa et al . , that a single velocity measurement that is more than 2@xmath03  @xmath25 from this mean should be repeated to search for potential radial velocity variables .",
    "indeed , rx  j1612.6 - 1924ee may turn out to be a spectroscopic binary and , on the basis of its discrepant radial velocity , certainly merits follow - up observations (  4.3.2 ) .",
    "however , both of the sb2s discovered here were initially observed , coincidentally , at phases during which the stellar motions were tangential to the line of sight .",
    "at least two radial velocity measurements may therefore be crucial .",
    "covey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measured the radial velocities of a sample of class i prototstars and compared these to the velocity of the local co gas .",
    "they identify one candidate radial velocity variable m star in ophiuchus using this approach .",
    "the constancy of the velocity dispersion in the areas around the @xmath10  oph core , as well as in the more distant smoke rings region and in upper scorpius , provide input as to the nature of star formation in this molecular cloud complex . feigelson ( 1996 ) argues that this implies a slow and continuous rate of star formation over a long period , after which thermal motions disperse the members with a spread of @xmath11  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the chamaeleon cloud presents a similar star formation history , in contrast to that observed in the discreet bursts of star formation in isolated cloudlets , as observed in the taurus - auriga complex ( feigelson ) .",
    "the spectroscopic multiplicity of the low - mass targets listed in table 1 is 4/33 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the uncertainties were determined using a binomial probability distribution , after burgasser et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . including the radial velocity variable , rx  j1612.6@xmath01924ew (  4.3 ) , the spectroscopic multiplicity is 5/33 , or @xmath36 .",
    "mathieu et al . ( 1989 ) found a similar sb fraction in their study of weak - lined t  tauri stars in the taurus - auriga , scorpius - ophiuchus , and corona australis star - forming regions , 9%@xmath264% , although their sample consists of primarily g and k spectral type systems .",
    "indeed , only 2 out of the 25 young sbs listed in mathieu ( 1994 ) are m stars .",

    "( 1988 ; table 1 ) , on average about two times more massive than the sample described here .",
    "thus , although recent results from the surveys of joergens ( 2006 ) and kurosawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have focussed mainly on samples of about a dozen young substellar objects ( i.e. targets of spectral type later than m6 ) and a few very low mass ( spectral type m2.5@xmath0m5.5 ) stars , this paper describes the largest homogeneous survey of low - mass t  tauri stars to date .",
    "the average spectral type of those presented in table 1 is m1 .",
    "three of the four sbs are systems with m1 star primaries ; the fourth has a k7 primary .",
    "although the occurrence of sbs is greater therefore in the higher mass bins , it is consistent with the distribution of masses studied .",
    "it is unlikely that any sbs were missed in the lower mass bins on the basis of poor radial velocity precision as the scatter in radial velocity measurements is indistinguishable between the early and late spectral type bins .",
    "melo ( 2003 ) draws attention to an excess in the frequency of spectroscopic binaries in ophiuchus compared to other small sfrs , such as taurus .",
    "sbs were identified in the three sub - regions with more than two stars surveyed , the smoke rings , r7 , and l1688 core .",
    "surveys parallel to this one , including similar sample sizes selected with the same criteria , will help to verify a true differences between molecular cloud complexes .",
    "currently , the numbers of young stars in any given region observed for spectroscopic multiplicity are small and the samples irregular .",
    "for example , observations by melo ( 2003 ) of about a dozen systems in scorpius - ophiuchus , 8 of them visual binaries , did not angularly resolve the components . in some cases ,",
    "double lines can be detected if one or both components of a visual binary are sbs ; however , the blended light from three or more stars can also disguise the signal from a low - mass or long - period companion .",
    "reipurth et al .",
    "( 2002 ) studied a sample of @xmath1100 young stars in mainly southern sfrs and identified 2 sbs and 5 radial velocity variables .",
    "those authors conclude that a contributing factor to the low spectroscopic multiplicity detected may be attributable to complications arising from observations of the complex , classical t  tauri star spectra .",
    "my sample contains 4 classical systems , none of which were found to be spectroscopic binaries or even radial velocity variables .",
    "however , the average rms radial velocity scatter of these 4 targets , @xmath10.6  km  s@xmath2 , is fairly consistent with that of the non - sb average : @xmath10.43  km  s@xmath2 . therefore , it is possible that the low sb detection rate of reipurth et al . resulted from other factors as well , such as the relatively blue wavelength range of their observations , 3600@xmath05200   , subject to stronger veiling from accretion processes in classical t  tauri stars than @xmath6-band observations .",
    "the slightly lower resolution of their spectra , 20,000 , might also account for the lower detection rate .",
    "it is also possible that ophiuchus is unusually rich in spectroscopic binaries as noted above , and that few of the reipurth et al .",
    "targets besides haro  1 - 14c were located in this region .      in order to estimate the sensitivity of this survey to small mass ratio systems , i consider a test case in which a 5  km  s@xmath2 primary star amplitude was measured in a 3 year period , i.e. the duration of this survey .",
    "this amplitude is consistent with the largest velocity change measured for radial velocity variable rx  j1612.6@xmath01924ew . assuming that one fourth of the orbit is traversed in 3 years",
    ", the total orbital period is 12 years ( luhman 2000 ) , and p@xmath1312 years would have an angular separation of @xmath10.04@xmath8 at a distance of 140  pc .",
    "this separation is equivalent to the diffraction limit of the keck ii telescope in the @xmath6-band and therefore provides a convenient definition for a spectroscopic versus a visual binary . ] . for an sb with an edge - on , circular orbit , and",
    "given @xmath37  km  s@xmath2 and p@xmath1312 years , the present study is sensitive to early m star sbs with mass ratios , q@xmath13m@xmath38/m@xmath39 , down to 0.6 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "observations of shorter period systems , however , are sensitive to smaller values of q. for a primary star mass of @xmath10.6  m@xmath32 and a mass ratio of 0.1 , the velocity modulation of the primary in an edge - on circular orbit will only be detectable at 5  km  s@xmath2 for periods of @xmath4040 days , or 0.11 years .",
    "this illustrates the strong bias towards detection of unity mass ratio systems among longer period sbs .",
    "mass ratio distributions of sbs over a wide range of periods will reflect this bias ; however , improved velocity precision will help to alleviate this limitation .",
    "the 5  km  s@xmath2 radial velocity amplitude is also conservative ; a 5@xmath25 detection and the internal radial velocity uncertainty of 0.43  km  s@xmath2 implies that measuring a 2.5  km  s@xmath2 should be achievable using the simple techniques applied here . with a 2.5  km  s@xmath2 primary velocity amplitude ,",
    "a system with a mass ratio of 0.1 and an @xmath10.6  m@xmath32 primary could be detected with a period as long as about 310 days .",
    "the star spots which are common and at times abundant on young , active stars can affect radial velocity measurements ( saar & donahue 1997 ) .",
    "one of the most active weak - lined t  tauri stars known , parenago 1724 , manifests a star spot induced periodic radial velocity modulation of @xmath15  km  s@xmath2 ( neuhauser et al .",
    "the sb1s and sb2s identified in this sample have primary star velocity variations of 9@xmath080  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus spot induced apparent radial velocity modulation is probably not significant .",
    "i have surveyed a homogeneous sample of young ( @xmath11  myr ) m stars in the ophiuchus sfr . the goals of this program were to identify the sb frequency of the sample , measure mass ratios of sb2 pairs , and begin to search for long - period systems suitable for high - angular resolution and interferometric orbit mapping .",
    "the following points summarize the conclusions of this work : + ( 1 ) including all of the spectroscopic and visual binary components detected , i detected evidence for a total of 41 stars in this sample , located in 30 systems .",
    "33 individual targets were observed spectroscopically to search for variable radial velocities .",
    "+ ( 2 ) there are 2 sb2s , 2 sb1s , and at least 1 radial velocity variable .",
    "an internal precision of 0.43  km  s@xmath2 was achieved .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the average spectral type of the sample was m1 ; three of the sb primaries are m1 stars and one is a k7 .",
    "the objects in the sample are located in 4 sub - regions of ophiuchus .",
    "the average radial velocity of the entire sample and of the individual sub - region objects is indistinguishable , supporting a scenario for continuous star formation across this molecular cloud complex . + ( 4 ) counting the 4 identified sbs in 33 systems ,",
    "the spectroscopic binary frequency in this sample is @xmath41 , similar to that found by previous spectroscopic studies of higher mass young stars as well as field stars .",
    "therefore , there appears to be no dearth of low - mass , stellar sbs in ophiuchus .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the sample is rich in visual binary pairs ; this work revealed 3 new visual binaries , all of separation @xmath91@xmath8 .",
    "a hierarchical quadruple was also identified : rx  j1622.7@xmath02325n is an 0.9@xmath8 pair within which the eastern star is an 0.1@xmath8 binary and the western one an sb2 .",
    "+ ( 6 ) both the sb and visual binary frequencies measured here are almost certainly incomplete .",
    "adaptive optics or @xmath42 observations will reveal additional angularly resolved components .",
    "followup observations to identify long - period , highly eccentric , and low - mass ratio sbs will also be important for a more stringent completeness limit .",
