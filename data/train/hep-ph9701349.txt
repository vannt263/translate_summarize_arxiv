    "@xcite is an attempt in this direction .",
    "however , besides the bottom quark and @xmath0 lepton mass unification  @xcite , several relations have been noticed in the past , sometimes justified on a theoretical basis , like , e.g. , @xmath1",

    "moreover we require that these families are massless in the fermion sector and exactly degenerate in the scalar sector in the limit of unbroken symmetry , as suggested by the smallness of light fermion yukawa couplings and by the upper limits on fcnc phenomena .",
    "the only suitable continuous non abelian unitary group is then u(2 ) .",
    "we prefer to consider a non abelian group because the representation structure , and so the theory , is more constrained than in the abelian case , where there is a large freedom in choosing the horizontal quantum numbers . on the contrary , in the u(2 ) case , the transformation properties of the flavons can be guessed from the requirement of having mixing among the three fermion families .    we do not want direct couplings of the flavon fields @xmath6 to the fermion fields @xmath7 through renormalizable operators . rather , we suppose that the flavons appear only in non renormalizable effective operators generated below a `` flavour scale '' @xmath8 at which the physics that mediate the u(2 ) breaking is integrated out .",
    "an example of such a physics is given by the `` froggatt - nielsen mechanism '' , as explained by g. ross in his lectures  @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath9 provide the small parameters needed to describe the fermion mass and mixing structure without using small couplings .",
    "let us choose the transformation properties of the two light families , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , under u(2 ) : @xmath12 ( the third family , as the higgses , is supposed to be u(2)-invariant ) .",
    "then , in order to generate mixing between the third and the light families , it is necessary to have a flavon field @xmath13 that transforms in the conjugate way relative to @xmath10 .",
    "this flavon gives rise to 12/3 mixing through yukawa interactions like @xmath14 .",
    "but @xmath13 only breaks u(2 ) to u(1 ) ( at a scale @xmath15 with @xmath16 ) and the u(1 ) residual symmetry prevents the lightest generation to get mass and to mix with the heavier ones . in order to break u(1 ) and to generate the operator @xmath17 , it is necessary to have a flavon field @xmath18 with transformation properties under u(2 ) as indicated by the position of the indexes , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are their antisymmetric and symmetric irreducible components . since @xmath21 breaks u(1 ) and gives mass to the lightest family , the corresponding scale of breaking @xmath22 has to be lower than @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , in order to generate the @xmath23 ratio at the same scale of @xmath24 , @xmath20 should break u(2 ) at the @xmath15 scale .",
    "if we finally suppose that all breakings of u(2 ) at the @xmath15 scale leave unbroken the same u(1 ) , we are left with the following breaking pattern ( in a suitable basis ) @xmath25[c]{{\\alph{mysubequation}}}}}\\\\[0.2\\baselineskip ] { \\langle \\phi^a \\rangle } = \\begin{pmatrix } 0 \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix } , \\enspace   { \\big\\langle a^{ab } \\big\\rangle } = \\begin{pmatrix } 0 & v \\\\ -v & 0 \\end{pmatrix } , \\enspace   { \\big\\langle s^{ab } \\big\\rangle } = \\begin{pmatrix } 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & v ' \\end{pmatrix } , { \\stepcounter{mysubequation }         \\tag{\\theequation\\makebox[\\myem][c]{{\\alph{mysubequation}}}}}\\\\   v , v>0 , \\qquad v \\ll v \\approx |v'| \\ll m. { \\stepcounter{mysubequation }         \\tag{\\theequation\\makebox[\\myem][c]{{\\alph{mysubequation}}}}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] also u(2 ) invariant fields can develop an expectation value and play a role .",
    "we denote them with @xmath26 .    as a consequence of the previous breaking pattern , the yukawa matrices @xmath27 and the scalar masses @xmath28 are in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to a ckm matrix in the form  @xcite @xmath34 in terms of @xmath35 and of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the previous form of the ckm matrix is in agreement with the experimental values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , due to the @xmath40 term in the @xmath41 entry , in the down quark sector we have @xmath42 in agreement with the experimental values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and with the limits on @xmath43 given by the value of @xmath44 , the cp violation parameter in the @xmath45-@xmath46 system  @xcite . in models",
    "in which the 22 entry is vanishing or of order @xmath47 it is on the contrary @xmath48    the ckm matrix in   has been obtained by diagonalizing a yukawa matrix in the form of eq .   in each sector of given charge @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 without comparing the yukawa matrices of different sectors . by doing that , we immediately see that , to reproduce the suppression of the mass ratios in the @xmath49-sector relative to the @xmath50- and @xmath51-sector ones ( `` @xmath52 '' line in table  [ tab : relazioni ] ) , the 12 , 21 and 22 entries of the @xmath49-sector yukawa matrix , @xmath53 , have to be suppressed relative to the corresponding entries in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this suppression can be explained in terms of couplings of order one only in presence of vertical relations among the coupling constants as those ones provided by an unified gauge group .",
    "let us then consider the u(2 ) theory in the case of the minimal unified group su(5 ) , where each family is represented by a tenplet @xmath56 and an anti - fiveplet @xmath57 .",
    "the flavons must transform as @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 under su(5 ) , otherwise they can not have a sm - invariant expectation value or they can not contribute to the yukawa matrices linearly .",

    "the @xmath65 and @xmath66 suppressions can then be explained if this two operators are vanishing and these ratios are generated at second order in the expectation values .",
    "can this happen in a natural way ?",
    "let us consider first the operator @xmath63 .",
    "since only the symmetric part of the product @xmath68 participates in this interaction , if @xmath20 transforms as @xmath60 under su(5 ) the operator @xmath69 vanishes because it can not be constructed in a su(5 ) invariant way . if @xmath20 is not a @xmath60 of su(5 ) , the only case in which @xmath70 vanishes is when @xmath20 has two components transforming as @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , but only for a particular value of the ratio of their expectation values .",
    "this possibility has not a natural interpretation in the su(5 ) context but has to be taken in consideration when additional vertical structure is present , as it is the case in so(10 ) .",
    "analogously , the @xmath71 operator vanishes only if @xmath19 is a su(5 ) singlet or if @xmath19 has two components transforming as @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for a particular value of the ratio of their expectation values .",
    "thus the su(5)@xmath72u(2 ) theory allows a natural explanation of the suppression of the @xmath49-sector mass ratios that requires @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is very interesting that in this case the @xmath75 relations in table  [ tab : relazioni ] are _ automatically _ predicted as a consequence of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 that follow from the sm decomposition of the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "let us consider now full unification of every single families through so(10 ) . in this case ,",
    "the possible representations of the flavons are @xmath58 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is possible to implement the mechanism described above by using representations for @xmath19 and @xmath20 having components transforming as @xmath58 and @xmath60 respectively under su(5 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath20 must transform as @xmath83 under so(10 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to explain the suppression of the @xmath49-sector mass ratios using only singlets and adjoints of so(10 ) .",
    "this is possible if @xmath20 is a so(10 ) adjoint and if the particular value of the ratio of its components transforming as @xmath58 and @xmath59 under su(5 ) is the one characteristic of the @xmath84 generator .",
    "moreover the expectation value of @xmath19 must be su(5 ) invariant .    to generate higher order contributions to the fermion masses we use the u(2)-invariant so(10)-adjoint field @xmath26 .",
