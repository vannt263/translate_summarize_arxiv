    "the contributions of these components in the blank - sky background will be different from those in the source dataset .",

    "an additional background dataset was produced for each observation to enable the subtraction of the acis readout artifact . while a ccd is being read out , source photons are still detected , creating a streak of source photons along the readout direction .",
    "the ratio of the readout time to the exposure time of one frame is @xmath34 , so @xmath34 of the source photons will be affected . following the method described by @xcite , we account for this effect by generating an additional background dataset from the source dataset , with the photon chip - y positions randomised and coordinates and energies recalculated .",
    "this normalisation of this readout background is set to @xmath34 of that of the source , and the blank - sky background normalisation is reduced accordingly .",
    "we note that the readout artifact was only significant for the clusters with very bright central peaks in their surface brightness distribution , but this correction procedure was applied to all data for consistency .",
    "exposure maps were generated at an energy of @xmath35 , chosen to correspond to the peak acis effective area .",
    "point and extended sources in the field were detected using the wavelet detection algorithm of @xcite . a broad band ( @xmath36 ) exposure - corrected image was used for point source detection , while the @xmath37 band was used for the detection of extended emission .",
    "the latter energy band was chosen to optimise signal to noise for typical cluster spectra and was used for all of the following imaging analysis .",
    "the centroid of the cluster emission was then located by refining its position with 5 iterations within @xmath38 and then 5 iterations within @xmath39 centered on the previous centroid ( with point sources masked out ) .",
    "the target coordinates for each observation were used as the starting point for the iterations .",
    "this centroid was then used to define the position of the cluster throughout the analysis .",
    "extended sources that were detected as distinct separate sources compared to the target cluster were excluded , but any substructure that was detected in the cluster was left untouched .",
    "the division between separate extended sources and cluster substructure is not always simple , and in many cases redshifts were not available for different emission components .",
    "the thirteen clusters with excluded extended sources within @xmath21  ( in projection ) are noted in [ s.notes ] .",
    "exposure - corrected radial profiles of the source and background images were then produced , with point sources excluded .",
    "an iterative process was followed to define the outer detection radius of the cluster emission and correctly normalise the background image in the imaging energy band .",
    "we defined the detection radius ( @xmath40 ) as the outer radius of the last bin with a width between @xmath41 and @xmath38 in which emission was detected at @xmath42 .",
    "while this is a weak criterion for detection , our purpose here is to be conservative in defining a source - free region in each observation , and the detection radii were confirmed by visual inspection of the source and background radial profiles . in each step of the iteration ,",
    "the detection radius was determined , and a background scaling factor was defined as the ratio of source and background count rates in the imaging band , with the emission within @xmath43  excluded .",
    "the background image was renormalised by this factor , and a new detection radius was computed .",
    "the process was repeated until @xmath43  converged to within @xmath44 .",
    "this method provides a robust normalisation of the background in the imaging band , and definition of the background emission in the source image .",
    "the key assumption of this method is that some of the field of view is free of cluster emission .",
    "visual inspection of the source and background radial profiles showed that this was the case even for the brightest clusters in the sample .",
    "if the cluster emission were not fully excluded in this process , then the remaining cluster emission would cause the soft background level to be overestimated .",
    "this would result in a correlation between the derived background scaling and the cluster flux .",

    "a spearman s rank test gives a @xmath45 correlation between background scaling and flux .",
    "however , this can be caused by a selection effect whereby fainter clusters are preferentially observed in fields with lower soft x - ray background levels .",

    "we found significant positive correlations between the soft x - ray background and both the cluster flux ( at @xmath48 probability ) and our background scaling factor ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "these two relations were then combined to predict the expected relation between background scaling and cluster flux under the hypothesis that any relation between those two variables is only due to the association of fainter clusters with lower background regions .",

    "the @xmath3-model is used solely to allow us to investigate the steepening of the profiles at large radii , and provide a first measurement of the cluster morphologies via their ellipticity .    in order to measure the local surface brightness slope at @xmath21(@xmath60 ) , the background - subtracted , exposure corrected profiles were grouped into logarithmic bins .",

    "the x - ray emissivity of the intra - cluster medium depends strongly on the gas density and only weakly on its temperature .",

    "the absorption of the spectral model was set at the galactic value and the metal abundance was set at @xmath67 . as the data are not sufficient to allow temperature profiles to be measured for most of the clusters in the sample , the temperature of the spectral model in each radial bin was obtained from the mean temperature profile found by @xcite , normalised to the global temperature measured for each cluster ( see [ s.rv ] ) . as noted above",

    "the slope is often measured by fitting a simple @xmath3-model to the data , but this has been found to underestimate the slope of the data at large radii as the fit is driven by the higher s / n data in the inner parts of the profile @xcite .",

    "this is not simply due to the absence of cooler systems in the distant subset ; the significance was unchanged when the systems cooler than @xmath168 were excluded from the local subset .",
    "this result , while not strongly significant , could indicate that the self - similarity breaking is due to processes that become more important at lower redshifts .",
    "alternatively , the possible flattening of the @xmath164 relation with redshift could be related to the morphological evolution of the clusters .",
    "however , we find no correlation between @xmath60 and @xmath80 to support this hypothesis .      finally , the large size of the sample enabled us to examine how the uncertainties on measured spectral properties depend on the signal to noise ratio of the spectra .",

    "an important factor in these results is likely to be the higher cluster merger rate at high redshifts .",
    "this is predicted by cosmological simulations ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and explains the absence of relaxed , cool - core clusters at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the changing cool - core population in turn has an effect on the metal abundance evolution , both because the metal abundances in the cool cores is higher and because the high emissivity of those regions then biases the the global emission - weighted abundances towards higher values .",
