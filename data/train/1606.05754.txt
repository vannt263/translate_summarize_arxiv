    "very recently @xcite the @xmath4 pole mass was calculated in a strongly magnetized medium using the two flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite . with this aim , a generalization of the standard @xmath5 evaluation , within the rpa ( or ladder approximation ) @xcite , has been carried out to take into account the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the formalism employed in ref.@xcite is based on the use of field dependent feynman propagators @xcite and a field independent regularization scheme ( mfir ) @xcite which separates divergent vacuum contributions from finite thermo - magnetic ones .",
    "the advantages of using the mfir , specially in connection with high density effects , have been recently discussed in great detail @xcite . in those references",
    "it has been discussed that calculations which employ @xmath6dependent regularizations display , in general , a spurious behavior specially at high magnetic field values which constitute a serious drawback for their use in many physical situations of interest as discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "other powerful tools which have been employed in the evaluation of pionic observables include chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite and effective quark - antiquark lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic catalysis phenomenon ( mc ) , ie . , the enhancement of the quark condensate when the magnetic field increases is a common characteristic of all mean field calculations .",
    "however , accurate lattice calculations at zero chemical potential and finite temperature predict exactly the opposite behavior close to the ( pseudo ) critical temperature .",
    "this effect has been called inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) or magnetic inhibition @xcite .    in some recent calculations @xcite thermo - magnetic effects",
    "were included in the standard two - flavor version of the njl model , where the coupling constant @xmath7 has been allowed to become temperature and magnetic field dependent , i.e . , @xmath8 , and fitted according to recent lattice results for the quark condensates , emulating the running of the qcd coupling constant with magnetic field and temperature , and thus incorporating imc .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the thermodynamic quantities calculated with the su(2 ) njl model using @xmath9 behave in accordance with lattice predictions , something which is impossible to obtain in the traditional calculations with constant coupling .",
    "in the present letter we improve the application of ref .",
    "@xcite by determining an accurate running coupling , @xmath1 , at vanishing temperatures , following the procedure introduced recently in ref .",
    "@xcite where the thermo - magnetic running ( in the high-@xmath10 limit ) was determined .",
    "we show that in this case the neutral pion mass , which represents the soft mode , is in excellent numerical agreement with lattice qcd simulations  @xcite . at the same time",
    "we find that the scalar meson mass remains almost constant for a wide range of @xmath11 values .",
    "this interesting result , which is a byproduct of the stability of the effective quark mass within our approach , should be contrasted to the linear increase found when a fixed coupling is used , causing the scalar mode to decouple at strong magnetic fields .",
    "we also investigate the neutral pion decay constant and predict that this quantity increases with @xmath12 in a way compatible with the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation .",
    "finally , we also predict that the meson - quark couplings decrease with increasing magnetic fields .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in the next section we present the model and the formalism .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in sec . 3 and our concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "let us start by reviewing the main steps related to the evaluation of the mesonic properties using the rpa formalism within the mfir framework as done in ref .",

    "this was particularly important at finite temperatures since in general the ( pseudo)temperature is proportional to the value of the effective mass value at zero temperature ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ fig4 ] , our results for the neutral pion decay constant are shown .",
    "the same three sets of coupling constants of fig.[fig3 ] have been considered . a systematic increase of @xmath120 as a function of @xmath11 occurs for all three parameterizations and qualitatively both @xmath111 and @xmath71 constant coupling cases show a similar behavior , although a less dramatic increase takes place at fields greater than @xmath121 .",
    "our prediction for @xmath120 , @xmath122 and the quark condensates are compatible with the gor relation .",
    "notice that the validity of the approximation @xmath64 is confirmed since one can hardly see the difference between the calculations using @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",

    "[ fig4 ] , predicting a initial decrease of its values up to @xmath125 , and then a steadily increase with higher fields for both @xmath111 and @xmath71 cases , while for @xmath1 case we obtain a prediction of a continuous decrease which again could be anticipated by recalling that @xmath126 and that @xmath120 increases with @xmath12 .",
    "note also that the curve has the same shape as the one showed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath108 . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show once again our results for the neutral pion mass but now , having in mind a quantitative comparison with lattice qcd results , we use the parameter set iv of table i. in this parametrization the current quark mass is set equal to 50.16 mev in order to obtain for @xmath5 the @xmath0 mass of 417 mev , which is the value used in the lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "thus , we can compare the results using different coupling constants with the recent lattice results showing that the behavior of the masses as a function of @xmath11 is qualitatively the same as found in the top panel of fig .",
    "that is , in accordance with lqcd predictions , our results indicate that the neutral pion remains a soft mode over a rather wide range of @xmath12 values .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] indicates that only when @xmath1 is used in conjunction with a heavy current quark mass a very good quantitative agreement with recent lqcd results within the wilson fermions formulation @xcite is obtained . in those investigations ,",
    "the authors discuss how the lqcd results for the pion mass in external magnetic fields depend on the critical hopping parameters , in particular , they show that the impact of their results within the wilson fermions formulation has been ignored in previous works .",
    "the use of constant bare quark masses in the lqcd calculations implies that the neutral pion mass consistently decreases when @xmath11 grows .",
    "the agreement between our calculations and the lqcd results is also a good evidence that more sophisticated results can be achieved when one assumes that the njl su(2 ) coupling constant has a dependence on @xmath11 as proposed in refs .",
    "the properties of magnetized neutral mesons have been investigated using a fixed and a @xmath12-dependent coupling constant so that model predictions and lqcd results related to inverse magnetic catalysis agree .",
    "the evaluations have been performed using the two flavor njl model following the rpa - mfir framework presented in ref .",
    "one of our main results shows that the @xmath0 remains a soft mode even at rather high field strengths ( @xmath127 ) since its mass decreases by about @xmath128 .",
    "the quantitative agreement between our results and recent lqcd predictions is remarkable .",
    "another physically interesting result refers to the behavior of the scalar meson mass which is predicted to steadily increase when a fixed coupling is used reaching ( at @xmath129 ) a value which is two and half times higher than its value at @xmath5 , also indicating a decrease of the correlation length , while our results predict that @xmath59 remains quite stable .",
    "the different predictions can be easily understood by recalling @xmath130 and that , owing to the mc effect , the order parameter @xmath131 increases within both approaches . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective quark mass naturally increases when one uses a constant @xmath109 ( and @xmath71 ) and remains practically stable when @xmath1 is considered yielding the observed different type of behavior .",
    "although the quark mass does not necessarily represent a physical observable this is still an interesting result since the behavior of @xmath108 gets directly reflected in @xmath132 . when the different model prescriptions are used to evaluate the @xmath0 decay the one which employs @xmath1 predicts an increase which is sharper than the one predicted by using a constant coupling value and , together with our predictions for @xmath122 and quark condensates , observes the gor relation . finally , when comparing model predictions for the meson coupling constant @xmath133 we found that the use of @xmath1 and @xmath109 ( and @xmath71 ) indicate an opposite behavior since the former predicts this quantity to decrease with @xmath12 while the latter predicts it to increase .",
    "once again the differences are easily understood from the discussions above and by recalling that this coupling is proportional to @xmath134 .",
    "the results obtained in this letter seem to indicate that the use of a running coupling within a robust theoretical framework , such as the rpa - mfir , turns the simple njl into a useful tool to investigate magnetized quark matter .",
