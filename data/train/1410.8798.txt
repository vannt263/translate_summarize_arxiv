    "since the discovery of a fluid - to - solid transition in hard spheres by computer simulations @xcite , the hard sphere model has become one of the paradigms  @xcite for the study of nucleation and crystal growth  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the hard sphere interaction potential allows for the development of theoretical and computational approaches that allow for quantitative predictions in the context of crystallization phenomena  @xcite . the crucial thermodynamic parameter which governs the mechanism of homogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth of the crystal from the melt is the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy , @xmath1 , defined as the reversible work required to form an unit area of a crystal - liquid interface  @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous nucleation rate as well as the final morphology of the resulting crystal are strongly dependent on the magnitude and anisotropy of this quantity  @xcite",
    ".    several simulation as well as theoretical approaches [ based on density functional theory ( dft ) ] have attempted to determine the interfacial free energy of hard - sphere systems , though there have been some discrepancy in the results obtained from these various methods  @xcite .",
    "a direct determination of @xmath1 for hard sphere systems was made in ref .",
    "@xcite using a thermodynamic integration  @xcite approach known as the `` cleaving wall '' method .",
    "later , the estimates for @xmath1 were revised  @xcite after fixing an error in the previous ti scheme .",
    "the same authors carried out ti simulations with the soft - sphere potential and extrapolated the results to the hard - sphere limit  @xcite .",
    "data in ref .",
    "@xcite were a little higher than those reported for the pure hard sphere system  @xcite .",
    "the most reliable estimates from an indirect approach based on capillary fluctuations  @xcite were about @xmath2 higher than those reported in ref .",
    "results from dft  @xcite , while in good agreement with the `` cleaving wall '' and capillary fluctuation methods as regards the anisotropy is concerned , yielded larger values for the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "results from the tethered monte carlo approach are consistent with the capillary fluctuation method  @xcite but are a few percentages higher than those reported in ref .  @xcite    in the  cleaving walls \" scheme  @xcite , the thermodynamic integration was carried out by using an external wall , consisting of particles arranged in an ideal lattice structure , to split the bulk phases and then join them together .",
    "finally , the walls were removed resulting in crystal and liquid phases separated by two interfaces . in this approach , there were uncontrolled hysteresis errors in the last step when the external walls were removed .",
    "when both phases are joined together , the interface is formed at the walls . however ,",
    "when such `` cleaving walls '' are gradually removed , the interface drifts on account of thermal fluctuations . in long simulations , the interfaces can travel far from the walls by freezing at one end and simultaneously melting at the other end  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the reverse process ( when the cleaving walls are reinserted ) does not retrace the same path as the forward process , showing the existence of hysteresis .",
    "this affects the accuracy in the final estimates of @xmath1 . while the interfacial drift is not a problem for liquid - liquid interfaces  @xcite , it is far more severe for the crystal - liquid interface and needs to be overcome in order to obtain accurate values for @xmath1 .    in a recent work ,",
    "we have developed a novel ti scheme to compute @xmath1 for the lennard - jones potential  @xcite .",
    "our method is able to circumvent problems associated with the drift of the crystal - liquid interface and provides a better control of hysteresis errors associated with the latter drift .",
    "the strategy was to use extremely short - ranged and flat gaussian walls to constrain the position of the interface while imposing a negligible free energy penalty .",
    "another novelty of our scheme was the use of structured walls consisting of frozen - in crystalline layers to smoothly transform the system from separate bulk phases to two interfaces in contact with the bulk fluid and crystal phases .",
    "apart from the ti scheme , the reliability of @xmath1 estimates also depends on properly accounting for the finite - size effects .",

    "the hard sphere interactions are described by a very short - ranged inverse power - law potential ( see below ) .",
    "the reason for using such a short - ranged continuous potential is the easy adaptability of our ti scheme developed for the continuous lj potential into the soft - sphere potential . since our ti scheme involves a direct modification of the interaction potential , it is easier to fit it into a conventional md simulation with continuous potential rather than to a collisional event - driven md algorithm for a discontinuous hard - sphere potential  @xcite .    to account for errors due to finite size effects and",

    "compared to previous ti methods such as the  cleaving potential \"  @xcite or  cleaving walls \"  @xcite scheme , our approach differs in two crucial ways .",
    "firstly , in order to achieve minimal perturbation of the crystalline phase during the transformation , the liquid should be ordered into a crystal - like layers near the boundaries of the simulation box and this ordering must be compatible with the actual structure of the crystal phase . in our ti scheme , this is achieved by introducing a structured solid wall , consisting of particles belonging to the crystal phase , frozen into their instantaneous equilibrium position .",
    "interactions between the particles in the bulk phases and the structured wall are of the same kind as that between the bulk particles .    secondly , to tackle the problem associated with the movement of the crystal - fluid interface due to thermal fluctuations  @xcite , a gaussian flat wall is introduced to prevent the interface from drifting during the simulation . however , unlike the previous ti scheme @xcite , where an extremely short - ranged flat wall is introduced at the beginning of the scheme , here in the first step we introduce a flat wall with a similar range as the interaction potential between the particles . only in the final step ,",
    "the range of this wall is gradually reduced to a value much smaller than the effective size of the particles @xmath10 ( about @xmath21 times less ) .",
    "this trick saves computational time as a short - time step needs to be used in the final step to integrate the short - ranged forces .",
    "the use of a multiple time - step algorithm  @xcite in the final step further improves the computational efficiency of the scheme .",
    "initially , bulk liquid and crystal phases are simulated in a box with dimensions @xmath22 such that the two phases have the same volume but different particle numbers .",
    "the final state consists of two crystal - liquid interfaces connecting the bulk phases , with a total length @xmath23 along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "the ti scheme proceeds via six steps and in each step the transformations are carried out by directly modifying the interaction potential by a parameter @xmath25 .",
    "this idea is similar to the ti scheme presented in earlier works to compute @xmath1 and the interfacial free energies of liquid and crystal phases in contact with flat and structured walls  @xcite .",
    "the specific choices of the @xmath25 parameterizations adopted below , yielded smooth thermodynamic integrands allowing for an accurate numerical calculation of the integrals . in the following ,",

    "_ steps 1 and 2 _ : the initial thermodynamic state of our system consists of separate bulk liquid and crystal phases with periodic boundary conditions ( along the @xmath24 direction ) , while the final state involves liquid and crystal separated by two interfaces . to reach the final state , at some point during the transformation , interactions between the two sides of each phase through the periodic boundaries must be switched off while the interactions between the two phases must be turned on . while rearranging the periodic boundaries",
    ", it must be ensured that the particles belonging to each phase remain inside their respective simulation cells and do not cross the boundaries such that density of each phase in its box remains at the respective coexistence density .",
    "for this purpose , in the first and second steps , a gaussian flat wall is gradually introduced at both ends of the liquid and crystal simulation boxes respectively , along the @xmath24 direction [ sketch ( 1 ) in fig .",

    "( [ eq : hamilt_step5 ] ) , there is a one - to - one correspondence in the @xmath25-parameterizations such that interactions between the crystal and liquid phases are turned on while interactions with the structured wall are switched off to ensure a smoothly varying thermodynamic integrand .",

    "the last step involves removing the flat walls and it is difficult to achieve total control over the reversibility of the scheme . due to thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the two interfaces can move by melting on one side and refreezing on the other side , if the potential barrier due to the walls is weak enough , i.e.  ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , this makes the transformation irreversible since if the walls are reinserted , the position of the interfaces will not coincide with the position of the walls . as a result , in the two simulation boxes a mixture of liquid and crystal phases",

    "however , our simulations showed that reducing the range of the flat wall to such a low value is unnecessary for our purpose , since the combined numerical and statistical errors from steps one to five would be much larger than the total contribution from step 6b .    generally , the contribution of step 6b , depends on the average density of particles in the interface region .",
    "prior work on the crystal - liquid interface corresponding to hard sphere systems has shown that density near the interface is the mean of the bulk liquid and solid coexistence densities  @xcite . even accounting for capillary fluctuations , the average density will not be very far from this mean value . therefore , the contribution of step 6b will be close to that obtained for the flat wall - liquid interface .",
