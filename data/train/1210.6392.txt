    "a bes experiment looking for the decay of @xmath0 @xcite observed a neat peak close to the @xmath1 threshold which was tentatively associated to a @xmath9 state with mass around 1812 mev and width of about 105 mev .",
    "an experiment with ten times more statistics has been reported recently @xcite and the peak is reconfirmed , the reanalysis leading to claims of a state with mass @xmath10 mev and a width @xmath11 mev , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "they also report a product of branching ratios @xmath12 .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 is doubly ozi suppressed with a production rate that is smaller by at least one order of magnitude with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .    as usual , any new claim of a state",
    "is followed by theoretical suggestions for its interpretation , and in this case there have been works offering possible interpretations as a tetraquark state @xcite , a hybrid @xcite , a glueball state @xcite , a threshold cusp attracting a resonance @xcite and an effect due to intermediate meson rescattering @xcite .",
    "so far , none of these interpretations has been ruled out or supported by the experiment .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath15 is considered , where @xmath16 is a glueball state , followed by the decay of @xmath16 into vector - vector , which is studied in refs .",
    "@xcite within the vector meson dominance hypothesis .",
    "the possibility that the peak seen at bes could be a glueball is found likely , although other alternative explanations are not excluded .    in the present work we propose a different interpretation as due to the production of the @xmath6 resonance below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "we shall show that the presence of this resonance necessarily leads to a peak around the @xmath1 threshold with a shape and strength compatible with experiment . invoking the principle",
    "that if one phenomenon can be explained by an already established mechanism one should not make claims of new physics , we will conclude that the observed peak is not a signal of a new resonance but a manifestation of the @xmath6 .",
    "one might try to cast doubts on the peak seen in bes iii since a devoted search of the belle collaboration in the @xmath17 reaction @xcite does not see the peak .",
    "however , we shall provide an explanation of why these two facts are not contradictory .    a very strong argument against the peak being a new resonance decaying to @xmath7",
    "is provided by the fact that both the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 couple strongly to @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 can emit both a @xmath3 pair and one of the @xmath20 can be exchanged virtually between the two vectors , leading to a decay of the @xmath21 state into @xmath3 with @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ dec ] ) .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section ii .",
    "c and fig . 2 of ref .",
    "there one can see that the largest part of the width of a resonance with mass around 1800 mev coupling to @xmath7 would be due to the decay into the @xmath23 channel since there is practically no phase space for decay into @xmath7 or @xmath24 . in the @xmath23 decay channel the mass of the resonance",
    "would be very far from the @xmath23 threshold and the peak should be clearly observable , with no ambiguities about its interpretation decay channel . ] . yet , in the experiment studying @xmath25 decay into @xmath26 , clear peaks are seen for the @xmath27 and @xmath6 but no trace is seen of any peak around 1800 mev @xcite .",
    "similarly , mark iii  @xcite reports a clear signal for the @xmath6 in the @xmath23 spectra but no signal around 1800 mev .     of mass",
    "@xmath28 1800 mev , that couples to @xmath7 , decaying to @xmath23 . ]    at the same time a new resonance is being claimed with quantum numbers @xmath21 and mass close to 1800 mev , observed in the two pion and four pion mass spectrum , named @xmath29  @xcite and which one could be tempted to link to the peak found in @xmath30 .",
    "this possibility can be , however , easily ruled out by considering the fact that the decay of @xmath29 to @xmath23 has been found to be strongly suppressed as compared to @xmath31 or @xmath32 channels ( for a natural explanation of this property of the @xmath29 see ref .",
    "quoting textually from ref .",
    "@xcite :  a particular feature is that the @xmath33 is strong , but there is little or no corresponding signal for decays to @xmath23 \" . as a consequence , the enhancement observed near threshold in @xmath34 can not be related with the @xmath29 since the @xmath7 system would not have a suppressed decay to @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ dec ] ) , but just the opposite , as explained a few lines above .    among the theoretical papers",
    "mentioned , ref .",
    "@xcite deserves a special attention since the idea is also that the peak observed could be a manifestation of the @xmath6 resonance , as we state here , a possibility also hinted in ref .",
    "the idea in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the @xmath25 decays into @xmath35 , then the @xmath6 resonance couples to a pair of mesons ( vector mesons , particularly @xmath36 , were shown to be dominant ) and there is rescattering of these vector mesons to produce the @xmath1 final state .",
    "an enhancement close to the @xmath1 threshold was produced with this mechanism , with a strength much smaller than the experimental data , and no firm conclusions were drawn . yet , as the authors mentioned , there were many unknowns in the model , particularly tied to the interaction of vector mesons ( @xmath37 ) , where a perturbative approach was followed , assuming @xmath38 transition mediated by @xmath20 and @xmath39 exchange . an important step forward in this direction",
    "was taken later on in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a thorough study of the vector - vector interaction was done using a coupled channel unitary approach with the dynamics extracted from the local hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite .",
    "this study allowed to see that the vector - vector scattering matrices develop some poles as a consequence of the interaction , and resonances are generated .",
    "these resonant states qualify as molecular states of two vector mesons and are usually referred to as dynamically generated resonances . among many of them , the @xmath6",
    "is generated and couples strongly to @xmath40 and @xmath1 .",
    "in such a case , the mechanism for final @xmath1 production proceeds with a primary production of @xmath41 followed by rescattering of these vectors to produce @xmath1 in the final state . as we shall see , the primary production of @xmath1 is not allowed and only the @xmath42 rescattering leads to the @xmath1 in the final state .",
    "one could reinterpret the doubly ozi suppressed mechanism for @xmath43 production in this way , the first suppression applying to the production of all vv pairs without charm .",
    "this particular feature actually works in favor of having a more neat resonant shape since the @xmath1 comes only from rescattering of the vector mesons by means of an amplitude that incorporates the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "thus , a background from uncorrelated @xmath1 production is essentially absent in the mechanism of production and the effects of the @xmath6 show up more clearly . since the resonance is below the @xmath1 threshold , it is a combination of the tail of this resonance and the increasing phase space for @xmath1 production what produces the visible peak .",
    "an enhancement of the strength near threshold due to resonances below threshold is unavoidable and this is a well known effect .",
    "sometimes this shows up only as a deviation from phase space , with no peak structure @xcite , but , depending on the strength of the background , sometimes it can also show up as a clear peak .",
    "this was the case of the @xmath44 reaction , where one peak close to the @xmath45 threshold was observed and associated to a resonance in the belle collaboration work of ref .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that a better fit to the data occurred due to the presence of a scalar hidden charm state below the @xmath46 threshold , x(3700 ) , predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the absence of a significant background for @xmath1 production magnifies the resonance shape close to the @xmath1 threshold , to the point that in refs .",
    "@xcite a strong case was made about the discovery of a new resonance .",
    "we shall argue here that this is not the case , showing that the peak comes as an unavoidable consequence of the coupling of @xmath1 to the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the study of the radiative decay modes of the @xmath25 into a photon and one of the tensor mesons @xmath47 , @xmath48 , as well as the scalar ones @xmath49 and @xmath6 , was undertaken and a good agreement with ratios of branching ratios was obtained .",
    "we will follow closely this formalism since for our present study we need both the radiative decay of the @xmath25 into @xmath6 , as well as the more concrete one of the @xmath0 .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume , following the argumentation of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the mechanism of fig .",
    "[ f1]a     radiative decay considering the possibilities that : ( a ) the photon is radiated from the initial @xmath50 state and ( b ) the photon is radiated from the final hadronic state . ]    dominates the reaction .",
    "further support for this assumption was found in ref .",
    "then , the @xmath51 component after the @xmath52 radiation can decay into pairs of vectors , which inevitably will interact among themselves .",
    "this is shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .",
    "decay into a photon and one dynamically generated resonance . ]",
    "the following step is to recall that the @xmath51 object can be considered as an su(3 ) singlet and then the pair of original vectors in the primary step will couple to an su(3 ) singlet .",
    "the vector - vector content in the su(3 ) singlet can be easily obtained from the trace of @xmath53 @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the su(3 ) matrix of the vector mesons @xmath55 we , thus , find the vertex @xmath56 one then projects this combination of vv states , which are the building blocks of the resonance produced , into vv isospin states with unitary normalization ( an extra factor @xmath57 for identical particles or symmetrized ones ) and phase convention @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 with vv pairs in @xmath61 : @xmath62 it is interesting to note that there is no primary production of @xmath1 with this mechanism .",
    "production of @xmath1 will occur with the rescattering of the primary @xmath42 vectors as depicted in fig .",

    "the factor @xmath75 stands for the coefficient @xmath64 and @xmath76 are then the @xmath77 coefficients given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cg ] ) .",
    "the argument about the absence of @xmath7 tree level is quite powerful .",
    "indeed , take now the belle reaction mentioned in the introduction @xmath8 .",
    "this is a weak interaction process which does not conserve isospin , and , thus , su(3 ) . as a consequence we can not associate a unique su(3 ) representation to the @xmath7 system and then we can have tree level @xmath7 background which would blur the appearance of a possible peak .",
    "we shall give an example of this at the end of the results section .",
    "in view of this argument , the facts that a peak in the @xmath7 invariant mass is seen in the bes experiment but not at belle can be reconciled .",
    "thus , the belle finding can not be used to cast doubts on the bes peak , which we do not question .",
    "instead we show that it is unavoidable as a consequence of the presence of the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "the @xmath78 matrices can be traced back to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by writing for each resonance @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the couplings of the resonance to the @xmath81 channels .",

    "the value of this quantity is relevant because , together with the shape of the @xmath1 mass distribution , it can be compared with the experimental values .",

    "then , the agreement on the absolute values of the rate of production relative to @xmath130 is a strong point in favor of the idea exposed here that the peak observed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is due to the excitation of the @xmath82 resonance and its further decay into @xmath131 .",
    "we have stressed the relevance of not having the @xmath7 primary production to produce the shape of the experimental distribution . in order to further understand this point",

    "( [ eq : totalgamma ] ) by @xmath136 . in this case",
    "we observe that the background of the tree level largely dominates the distribution and only a very small peak at threshold appears that could be missed in an experiment with low resolution .",
    "in this work we had a look at the data of two bes experiments for the reaction @xmath0 , where a neat peak is observed in the @xmath1 mass distribution close to the @xmath1 threshold . in the experimental works",
    "this peak was seen as a signal of one new scalar meson state with mass around 1800 mev , not reported in the pdg .",
    "we made the important observation that both @xmath19 and @xmath18 couple strongly to @xmath3 ( with the same strength ) and a scalar resonance coupling to @xmath1 unavoidably would couple to @xmath3 , and it should be seen cleanly in the @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "the fact that no trace of a peak was seen in the experiment around this energy in the @xmath4 reaction was proof enough to rule out the peak observed in @xmath137 as a signal for a new state .",
    "we also noted that the lack of the tree level contribution for @xmath7 production in the @xmath0 reaction allowed to obtain a clear peak in the @xmath7 invariant mass distribution . in this sense , we showed that in a reaction like in the belle experiment @xmath8  @xcite there can be such @xmath7 tree level contribution and the large background can dilute the peak , otherwise observed in the bes experiment .",
    "the main part of the work has then been devoted to show that the peak observed in the experiment is naturally obtained from the excitation of the @xmath6 resonance and its coupling to @xmath1 .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath1 distribution with experiment was excellent and the absolute rates for the partial decay width of @xmath0 reaction were also in very good agreement with experiment .",
