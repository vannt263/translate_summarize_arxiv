    "since the birth of the kam theory ( see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) , the invariant tori are expected to be the key dynamical object which explains the ( nearly perfect ) quasi - periodicity of the planetary motions of our solar system .    among the consequences of the kam theory , which concern the tori of maximal dimension",
    ", the following one looks natural . in a planetary system including @xmath0 planets , one expects that the persistence under small perturbations should hold also for the @xmath0dimensional invariant tori , which are a slight deformation of the composition of @xmath0 _ coplanar circular _ keplerian orbits .",
    "however , a separate proof is needed in order to ensure the existence of these lower dimensional invariant tori which are said to be elliptic , because they correspond to stable equilibrium points of the secular motions . such a theorem has been recently proved by biasco , chierchia and valdinoci in two different cases : for the spatial three  body planetary problem and for a planar system with a central star and @xmath0 planets ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively ) . in our opinion , their approach is deep from a theoretical point of view , but is not suitable for explicit applications , even if one is interested just in finding the locations of the elliptic invariant tori . in order to clarify this point ,",
    "let us roughly summarize the scheme of their proofs as follows : first , they carry out all the preliminary canonical transformations that are necessary to bring the hamiltonian in a particular form , to which they can subsequently apply a theorem due to pschel ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , so to ensure the existence of elliptic lower dimensional tori .",
    "moreover , pschel s versions of this theorem are based on a careful adaptation of the usual arnold s proof scheme for non - degenerate systems : the perturbation is removed by a sequence of canonical transformations which are defined on a subset of the phase space excluding the `` resonant regions '' ( see  @xcite and  @xcite )",
    ". since resonances are everywhere dense ( but the width of the regions eliminated around them is suitably decreased , when the order of the resonances increases ) , therefore the change of coordinates giving the shape of the invariant elliptic tori is defined on a cantor set which _ does not contain any open subset_. the efficiency of an eventual explicit application based of such an approach is highly questionable and , as far as we know , it has never been used to calculate an orbit of a celestial mechanics problem .",
    "the original proof scheme of the kam theorem , introduced by kolmogorov himself , is in a much better position for what concerns the translation into an explicit algorithm constructing invariant tori ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) . in fact , this approach has been successfully used to calculate the orbits for some interesting problems in celestial mechanics ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the present work aims to adapt the kolmogorov s algorithm , in order to construct a suitable normal form related to the elliptic tori .",
    "moreover , this will allow us to explicitly integrate the equations of motion on those invariant surfaces , by using a so called semi - analytic procedure .",
    "when one is interested in showing the long term stability of a planetary system , the construction of a normal form related to some fixed elliptic torus could be a relevant milestone .",
    "in fact , it is possible to ensure the effective stability in the neighborhood of such an invariant surface by implementing a partial construction of the birkhoff s normal form ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite , where this approach is used in order to study the stability nearby an invariant kam torus having maximal dimension ) . for what concerns our solar system ,",
    "such an approach might be applied to some asteroids with small orbital eccentricities and inclinations . however , as explained in  @xcite , this same approach can not yet succeed in proving the long - time stability of the major planets of our solar system",
    ".    the location of the elliptic tori can be useful also for practical purposes .",
    "in fact , the regions close to them are exceptionally stable , being mainly filled by invariant tori of maximal dimension .",
    "therefore , they can be of interest for spatial missions aiming , for instance , to observe asteroids not far from the elliptic tori .",
    "moreover , our technique should adapt quite easily also to the construction of hyperbolic tori that can be used in the design of spacecraft missions with transfers requiring low energy .",
    "also in view of this kind of applications , lower dimensional tori of elliptic , hyperbolic and mixed type have been studied in the vicinity of the lagrangian points for both the restricted three ",
    "body problem and the bicircular restricted four - body problem ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the search for elliptic tori is applied just to a model not far from the sjsu _ planar _ system ( let us recall that the real orbits of the planets of our solar system _ are not _ lying on lower dimensional tori ) .",
    "therefore , sect .",
    "[ sec:2d_plan_ham ] is devoted to the introduction of our hamiltonian model and to the description of its expansion in canonical coordinates .",
    "this will allow us to write down the form of the hamiltonian to which our approach can be applied . by the way",
    ", we think that with some minor modifications our procedure should adapt also to the more general spatial case , after having performed the reduction of the angular momentum , which is not considered here in order to shorten the description of all the preliminary expansions ( for an introduction to some methods performing both the partial and the total reduction , see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "our algorithm constructing a normal form for elliptic tori is presented in a purely formal way in sect .",
    "[ sec : form_alg ] .",
    "let us recall that our procedure is mainly a reformulation of the classical kolmogorov s normalization algorithm , that is modified in a suitable way for our purposes .",
    "the theoretical background necessary to understand when our algorithm can converge is informally discussed in subsect .",
    "[ sbs : remarks_theory ] and it will be fully detailed in a future work ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "[ sec : num_tests ] is devoted to explain an application which is also a test of our procedure .",
    "first , in subsects .",
    "[ sbs : comp_algebra][sbs : expl_calc ] we describe the way to implement our algorithm , by using an algebraic manipulator on a computer so to produce both the normal form and the semi - analytic integration of the motion on an invariant elliptic torus . the fourier spectrum of the motions on elliptic tori is strongly characteristic : just the mean - motion frequencies and their linear combinations can show up .",
    "this simple remark allows us to check the accuracy of our results by using frequency analysis , as it will be described in sect .",
    "[ sbs : val_freq_anal ] .",
    "as claimed in the introduction , in order to fix the ideas , we think it is convenient to focus on a concrete planetary model , to which we will apply our algorithm constructing the elliptic tori in the next sections .",
    "let us consider four point bodies @xmath1 , with masses @xmath2 , mutually interacting according to newton s gravitational law . for shortness ,",
    "hereafter we will assume that the indexes @xmath3 correspond to sun , jupiter , saturn and uranus , respectively .",
    "let us now recall how the classical poincar variables can be introduced so to perform a first expansion of the hamiltonian around circular orbits , i.e. , having zero eccentricity .",
    "we basically follow the formalism introduced by poincar ( see @xcite and  @xcite ; for a modern exposition , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "we remove the motion of the center of mass by using heliocentric coordinates @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . denoting by @xmath6 the momenta conjugated to @xmath7 , the hamiltonian of the system has @xmath8 degress of freedom , and reads @xmath9 where @xmath10    the plane set of poincar s canonical variables is introduced as @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the semi - major axis , the eccentricity , the mean anomaly and the perihelion argument , respectively , of the @xmath15th planet .",
    "one immediately sees that both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are of the same order of magnitude as the eccentricity @xmath18 . using poincar s variables  ( [ var - poincare - piano ] )",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath19 can be rearranged so that one has @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the small dimensionless parameter @xmath25 highlights the different size of the terms appearing in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , let us remark that the time derivative of each coordinate is @xmath26 but in the case of the angles @xmath27 .",
    "thus , according to the common language in celestial mechanics , in the following we will refer to @xmath28 and to their conjugate actions @xmath29 as the _ fast variables _ , while @xmath30 will be called _ secular variables_.    we proceed now by expanding the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - iniz - poincare - var ] ) in order to construct the first basic approximation of the normal form for elliptic tori .",
    "after having chosen a center value @xmath31 for the taylor expansions with respect to the fast actions ( in a way we will explain later ) , we perform a translation @xmath32 defined as @xmath33 this is a canonical transformation that leaves the coordinates @xmath27 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 unchanged .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian @xmath36 can be expanded in power series of @xmath37 around the origin .",
    "thus , forgetting an unessential constant we rearrange the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath38 where the functions @xmath39 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath40 in the actions @xmath41 and of degree @xmath42 in the secular variables @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficients of such homogeneous polynomials do depend analytically and periodically on the angles @xmath27 .",
    "the terms @xmath44 of the keplerian part are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath40 in the actions @xmath45 , the explicit expression of which can be determined in a straightforward manner . in the latter equation the term which is both linear in the actions and independent of all the other canonical variables ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) has been separated in view of its relevance in perturbation theory , as it will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we also expand the coefficients of the power series @xmath47 in fourier series of the angles @xmath27 .",
    "the expansion of the hamiltonian is a traditional procedure in celestial mechanics .",
    "we work out these expansions for the case of the planar sjsu system using a specially devised algebraic manipulator .",
    "the calculation is based on the approach described in sect .",
    "2.1 of  @xcite , which in turn uses the scheme sketched in sect",
    ".  3.3 of  @xcite .       in table",
    "[ tab : scomp_spettr_urano ] we report our numerical results about the first @xmath48 summands of the decomposition  ( [ spettro - quasi - periodico ] ) for the uranus secular signal , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "let us point out that the values of the fast frequencies vector @xmath50 have been preliminarly calculated by looking at the main components of the fourier spectrum of the signals @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , we stress that the vectors @xmath53 listed in the third column are determined so to minimize the absolute difference @xmath54 with @xmath55 ; indeed , one has to fix some limits on the absolute value of @xmath56 , in order to make consistent its calculation , and our choice is motivated by the fact that the fourier decay of the analytic conjugacy function @xmath57 is such that the main contributions to the spectrum are related to low order harmonics .    .",

    "refer to the signal related to the motion starting from the initial conditions  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-9-passi ] ) [ ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-0-passi ] ) , resp . ] , i.e. the approximation of a point on an elliptic torus after having performed  @xmath62 [ @xmath63 , resp .",
    "] steps of the algorithm constructing the corresponding normal form . in both cases ,",
    "the results for just the first  @xmath48 components have been reported in the figure above.,width=453 ]    if the initial conditions  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-9-passi ] ) were exactly on an elliptic torus , each value @xmath54 reported in the fourth column of table  [ tab : scomp_spettr_urano ] should be equal to zero .",
    "all of them , except for the case corresponding to @xmath64 , are actually small enough to be considered as generated by round - off errors . on the other hand , we can definitely say that @xmath65 is a `` secular frequency '' , because its value is @xmath66 . indeed , let us recall that @xmath67 , but the mass ratio for uranus , i.e. @xmath68 , is even smaller .",
    "let us say that the occurrence of secular frequencies in the fourier decomposition of the signal should be expected .",
    "indeed , they could be completely avoided only in a very ideal situation , namely : ( i )  all the calculations described in sects .",
    "[ sec:2d_plan_ham ] and  [ sec : form_alg ] should be carried out without performing any truncations on the expansions , ( ii )  the initial conditions  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-9-passi ] ) should be replaced with @xmath69 , ( iii )  no numerical errors should be there . in a practical calculation",
    "the orbit can not be exactly placed on an elliptic torus , so the presence of secular frequencies just means that we are just close to it .",
    "nevertheless , it is very remarkable that the amplitude of the first found secular frequency is three orders of magnitude smaller than the main component of the spectrum . in our opinion , this is a first clear indication that our algorithm is properly working .",
    "other components corresponding to secular frequencies are expected to be even smaller than that found with @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , let us recall that the frequency analysis method detects the summands @xmath70 appearing in  ( [ spettro - quasi - periodico ] ) in a nearly decreasing order with respect to the amplitude @xmath58 ( for instance , one can easily see that just one exchange is needed in order to rewrite table  [ tab : scomp_spettr_urano ] in the correct decreasing order ) ; moreover , we calculated that the discrepancy @xmath71 is smaller than about @xmath72 for all the time values  @xmath73 for which we sampled the signal .",
    "let us emphasize that such an upper bound on the maximal discrepancy is just a little larger than the amplitude @xmath74 .",
    "a similar decomposition has been calculated for both the signals @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( which are related to the secular motions of jupiter and saturn , respectively ) .",
    "the behavior is very similar to that of table  [ tab : scomp_spettr_urano ] , so we omit the corresponding tables because the interesting results are more evident from the figures that we are going to present .      the most relevant information about such decompositions of the secular motions of the three planets is summarized in the plots done with the @xmath60 symbol appearing in figs .  [",
    "fig : ainf_giove][fig : ainf_urano ] .",
    "those figures contain also a comparison with the results provided by a , say , trivial approximation of an orbit on an elliptic torus .",
    "in fact , the dots marked with the @xmath61 symbol appearing in figs .  [ fig : ainf_giove][fig : ainf_urano ] refer to a frequency analysis which is performed exactly in the same way as that corresponding to the @xmath60 symbol , except the fact that the numerical integration of the equations of motion is started from the following initial conditions @xmath77 instead of that reported in formula  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-9-passi ] ) .",
    "let us remark that @xmath78 is a sort of trivial approximation of a point on the elliptic torus as it is provided by simply avoiding to apply the part of our algorithm constructing the normal form , as it is described in sect .",
    "[ sec : form_alg ] . in order to discuss in a more definite way",
    ", we have already assumed that the secular frequencies are @xmath66 , thus , let us separate them from the fast ones , when they are smaller than @xmath79 . by looking at the right side of figs .",
    "[ fig : ainf_giove][fig : ainf_urano ] , one can immediately remark that the parts of the spectra related to the fast frequencies are nearly indistinguishable when the initial conditions  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-9-passi ] ) or  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-0-passi ] ) are considered , because the dots marked with the symbols @xmath60 and @xmath61 superpose each other in a nearly exact way for what concerns all the main components . on the other hand , the secular parts of the spectra ( that are in the left side of figs .  [ fig : ainf_giove][fig : ainf_urano ] ) strongly differ .",
    "in fact , when the initial conditions  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-0-passi ] ) ( that trivially approximate a point on the elliptic torus ) are considered , three secular frequencies are detected ; while just one is found in the case of the more accurate initial data  ( [ cond - in - toro - ell - dopo-9-passi ] ) . moreover , by comparing the amplitudes , one can see that the unique secular component detected by both the frequency analyses is decreased by at least two orders of magnitude when our algorithm is applied . in our opinion , this comparison makes evident the effectiveness of our procedure constructing the normal form for an elliptic torus .",
