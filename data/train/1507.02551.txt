    "evidence of synchronized behavior has been found in mechanical , electronic and neuronal systems , as well as in chemical reactions and biological rhythms , to name but a few examples .",
    "a flurry of interest in synchronization started in the mid 1990s , with some earlier breakthroughs such as the kuramoto model @xcite paving the ground for it .",
    "the results of those fruitful years of research are reviewed in @xcite .    since the beginning of the previous decade",
    ", the focus has been moving from the study of the synchronized dynamics of just two or a few dynamical system , towards the study or large ensembles of oscillators with complex coupling arrangements . in this",
    "regard , the development of network theory @xcite allowed for a fruitful interaction between a dynamical point of view and a more topological perspective that has led to the present - day field of the synchronization of complex networks @xcite .    among these new developments ,",
    "the _ master stability function _ ( msf ) approach @xcite is a cornerstone of network synchronization research , and it provides the language in which the ideas we develop are written .",
    "the msf describes the stability of the synchronized state of a set of @xmath1 coupled dynamical units as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath2 and the topology of the network under study .",
    "given a network of @xmath1 dynamical systems , the evolution ( in isolation ) of the state of each node is described by a set of @xmath3-dimensional differential equations @xmath4 , where is the dynamic state vector of node @xmath5 . if nodes have a certain interaction between them , the evolution of the coupled systems is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath2 is the coupling strength , is a vectorial coupling function and @xmath7 are the elements of the network laplacian matrix .",
    "we here consider weighted networks : the connectivity is given by a weighted adjacency matrix whose elements @xmath8 are real numbers giving the link weights between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath9 if they are connected and zero otherwise .",
    "equivalently , the coupling can be represented ( as in eq .",
    "[ eq : msf ] ) by a weighted laplacian matrix defined as @xmath10 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : msf ] ) is equivalent to a diffusive coupling between the nodes of the network , the weight of the coupling contained in @xmath8 . due to the zero - row sum property of the laplacian matrix @xmath11 the synchronization manifold @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ,",
    "is an invariant set of the dynamics . under these conditions ,",
    "the msf approach provides a framework for the study of the stability of synchronization in which the topology and the dynamics are in some sense uncoupled .",
    "the stability of the synchronized dynamics or _",
    "synchronizability _ is established by computing the maximum lyapunov exponent of a suitably modified kernel that depends on a parameter @xmath14 , which is proportional to the coupling strength in the network @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this lyapunov exponent can be seen as the parameter giving the exponential divergence / convergence of perturbations orthogonal to the synchronization manifold , and when parameterized in terms of @xmath14 gives the msf curve , which we denote as @xmath16 .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath17 represents one of the nonzero eigenvalues of the graph laplacian matrix .",
    "the graph laplacian matrices of the networks considered in this work have a real and non - negative spectrum , with eigenvalues @xmath18 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes ( dynamical units ) of the network .",
    "moreover , as the networks are connected , only one eigenvalue is zero , and thus the corresponding to the different oscillation eigenmodes will be positive . for those values of @xmath14",
    "for which the msf is negative , perturbations transversal to the synchronization manifold damp out exponentially fast .",
    "for an uncoupled network , @xmath19 , the msf corresponds to that of the autonomous dynamics at each node , and is therefore either zero ( for regular dynamics ) or positive ( for chaotic dynamics ) .",
    "as @xmath14 is varied , the msf may become negative in some regions , and it is of specially interest to study the boundaries of those regions . when @xmath16 is negative for all , the synchronization manifold is stable and the network is said to be synchronizable @xcite .    for a given dynamical system and coupling function",
    ", three categories can be defined according to the classification proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : class i systems have a non - negative msf ( and are therefore not synchronizable ) , class ii systems are those that have an unbounded synchronizability region ( @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents the only zero of the msf ) and class iii systems are those that have a bounded synchronizability region ( @xmath20 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the two zeros of the msf ) . in practice , only a finite range of @xmath14 that is expected to cover all the cases of interest is considered , and the classification is applied in this restricted sense . if one considers larger @xmath14 ranges , msfs with more than two zero crossings are indeed possible , and some complicated msf curves have been reported for example in @xcite .    of these three main classes , class i and class ii are , in some sense , trivial .",
    "class i is not synchronizable , while class ii systems are always synchronizable for large enough @xmath2 , specifically for @xmath26 .",
    "however , the conditions for class iii systems to be synchronizable , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , imply that a topology such that @xmath29 is not synchronizable for any value of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , whatever the system , if it is class iii , a topology with a smaller eigenratio @xmath30 is easier to synchronize as the different @xmath31 that have to be accommodated within the synchronization region are bunched together more closely . following this argument",
    ", the optimal case is that for which @xmath32 , in which all the for @xmath33 , become equal , and the eigenratio @xmath34 reaches its minimum @xmath35 , leading to an optimal synchronizability ( i.e. , the one being stable for a larger range of @xmath2 ) .",
    "networks with this particular structure are known as _ maximally synchronizable networks _ ( msn ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the feasibility of transforming a given network into its msn and test its robustness to noise and parameter mismatch in real systems .",
    "while some publications have shown the possibility of enhancing the synchronizability of networks by rearranging the links @xcite , in many cases the creation or deletion of links is not available due to experimental restriction . here",
    ", we consider the architecture underlying the network topology to be fixed ( nodes are connected or disconnected once and for all ) , and try to achieve the graph that optimizes the stability of the synchronized state by tuning the link weights .",
    "we design an experimental implementation , by means of electronic circuits , of the msn and investigate its stability as a function of the coupling strength . interestingly ,",
    "we observe how the synchronization error is propagated through the network when the system is close to the synchronization boundaries .",
    "next , we analyze the effects of the deviations from the optimal topology on the synchronization of the whole system , and show the interplay between the _ topological noise _ with the coupling strength of the whole network .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    any undirected ( connected ) network can be converted into a msn by the following procedure @xcite :    1 .   select any node of the network as the initial node ( from now on , node @xmath36 ) .",

    "4 .   transform the links into unidirectional links pointing from the node that has been assigned the lower number to the node with the greater number .",
    "5 .   give a weight of @xmath39 to all incoming links of nodes @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the in - degree of node @xmath5 ( i.e. the number of neighbors whose links point to it ) , so that the total incoming weight of all nodes will be one , with the exception of node 1 ( which is zero ) .     are set to @xmath39 . ]    by following these steps , we obtain a directed weighted network with a weighted adjacency matrix such that @xmath42 if there is a link @xmath43 or zero otherwise . the corresponding elements of the resulting laplacian matrix are @xmath44 the full laplacian matrix therefore is a lower triangular matrix @xmath45 where the element @xmath7 for @xmath46 being denoted as @xmath47 means that it can be either @xmath48 if there is a link from @xmath9 to @xmath5 or zero if there is not .",
    "as the network is connected , node @xmath36 must have at least one neighbor , and therefore there must be a link from @xmath36 to @xmath49 , and that is why we do not apply this notation to @xmath50 , which is known to be @xmath51 .",

    "we conclude that the system size dependence of the synchronization region that is found experimentally can be attributed to the accumulation of synchronization error across the network layers .",
    "while the 12-bit resolution of the analog - to - digital acquisition card ( adc ) combined with a sampling of 100 @xmath82 ( kilosamples per second ) leads to truncation errors which are amplified due to the chaotic dynamics of the system ,    the synchronization error of these maps is normalized by the maximum achieved at any element of the matrix to facilitate comparisons between them .",
    "while in the completely asynchronous regime the propagation of the error does not have any significant effect , it is clear that within and around the synchronized regime the effect is quite visible , since nodes that are topologically further apart have a significantly larger synchronization error between them .",
    "so far we have been dealing with ideal msn topologies , where @xmath35 holds exactly ( within the small experimental errors because the electrical components have a 5% tolerance , the temperature is not a constant , and the recording equipment has a finite precision due to the analog - digital conversion ) .",
    "nevertheless , in experimental realizations , or real technological networks , noise is always at play and one can not expect such idealized model to reflect realistic conditions in less carefully controlled environments .",
    "not only is the intrinsic _ dynamical _ noise of the system present , but also deviations from the optimal topology can be expected ( i.e. , link weights could be affected by perturbations ) . in this section",
    "we propose some theoretical estimates about effect of _ topological noise _ on synchronizability , and validate these predictions experimentally .",
    "moreover , as frequently a very detailed knowledge of the topology may not be readily available , or may be extremely cumbersome to deal with if the network is very large , we favor an approach to the study of this issue based on a very limited knowledge of the system topology .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    let us assume the link weights in the msn are uniformly perturbed with additive noise .",
    "the perturbation that affects the link between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath9 ( assuming @xmath5 and @xmath9 are connected ) is denoted @xmath83 .",

    "for a given perturbed topology ( i.e. , for a given realization of @xmath83 for all @xmath5 and @xmath9 ) , we define @xmath89 , and @xmath90 analogously . the perturbed graph eigenvalues that affect the synchronizability properties of the system are therefore @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    in order to be able to make some concrete predictions , one has to assume a particular distribution for the noise terms .",
    "let us make the reasonable assumption that @xmath83 for all @xmath5 and @xmath9 are independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables of zero mean and standard deviation @xmath93 , which we denote @xmath94 ( our predictions can be , in principle , adapted to other probability densities ) . here",
    ", @xmath93 plays the role of the topological noise strength . from the well - known properties of the sums of gaussian random variables , @xmath95 for @xmath96 are therefore random variables distributed according to @xmath97 .",
    "we assume the only knowledge on the topology we have access to is a suitably defined _ typical degree _",
    "@xmath98 of the network . in regular random graphs such as erds - rnyi graphs",
    ", it makes sense to consider the mean degree , @xmath99 ; however , in scale - free networks where @xmath100 may be so much affected by the very large connectivity of some of the hubs , the median of the degree distribution may be a better choice @xmath101 .",
    "this very rudimentary knowledge can prove quite useful in giving estimates to the effect of noise , if one has also some information about the noise strength .",
    "a typical node is perturbed by a noise @xmath102 distributed according to @xmath103 , and we define the probability to obtain a value of @xmath102 that is larger than @xmath104 as @xmath105 obviously , the probability that @xmath102 is smaller than @xmath106 is also @xmath107 .",
    "as the noise affecting different nodes is stochastically independent , if @xmath108 holds , we may expect to have on average at least one node with noise intensity equal or greater than @xmath109 in absolute value .",
    "the procedure we propose consists in inverting the previous chain of reasoning . for a network of size @xmath1 and typical degree @xmath98 ,",
    "one first obtains the value @xmath104 such that the inequality above is exactly satisfied as an equality , @xmath110 .",
    "we denote this value as @xmath111 , while @xmath112 denotes the probability that a random variable distributed according to @xmath113 takes on values larger than @xmath111 .",
    "we expect that there will be on average one node in the network that is affected by a noise term greater than @xmath111 and also another one that is affected by a noise term smaller than @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and therefore @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "given the simplicity of the approximation , which is based only on knowledge of @xmath1 , @xmath98 and @xmath119 , one can not expect the estimates that result from it to be very precise .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that it usefully predicts the effect of topological noise on the network synchronizability quite satisfactorily .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    one has to consider that when a relatively weak noisy signal is injected to an electronic system in a controlled fashion to study its effects , the precise noise strength existing in the system is hard to determine , due to the intrinsic ( dynamical ) noise present in electronic circuitry and other experimental equipment that somehow add up to the noisy signal .",
    "a similar remark can be made about topological noise .",
    "the experimental study of the effects of topological noise on the synchronizability was designed with @xmath120 piecewise rssler oscillators coupled through a msn scheme obtained from a scale - free network following the procedure described above ( see fig [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we average @xmath121 independent realizations for coupling strengths around the area of the first zero @xmath24 of the msf .",
    "two gaussian noise strengths are considered , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , together with the case without topological noise @xmath124 .    as we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the onset of synchronization is seen to occur for larger @xmath2 as the noise strength is increased , as one would expect by the fact that the smallest eigenvalue is expected to decrease with respect to the msn case ( see the explanation above ) .",
    "moreover estimates of the effect of noise on the onset of synchronization based on the previous reasoning were also obtained ( using the median of the degree distribution @xmath125 as the only topological information , which plays the role of @xmath98 ) , showing that indeed the method outlined above is useful in predicting the effects of topological perturbations on the network synchronizability . in the experiment ,",
    "it is difficult to establish a well - defined onset of synchronization , as complete synchronization is never perfectly reached , and the level of synchronization achieved for any @xmath2 is dependent on @xmath93 .",
    "we consider the synchronization threshold to be @xmath126 , which indicated with a black vertical dashed line for @xmath127 .",
    "the associated increase in the coupling strength @xmath2 that is needed to reach the first zero of the msf ( considering @xmath128 ) is @xmath129 ( for @xmath122 ) and @xmath130 ( for @xmath131 ) .",
    "these estimates are indicated with vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]     with @xmath120 .",
    "the results here reported are averages of 20 independent realizations . ) . ]",
    "in summary , we have presented a strategy applicable to a generic connected and undirected network , which transform it into its directed , _ maximally synchronizable _ , configuration .",
    "our approach , indeed , allows tuning the directions and weights of the links of any given network , so as to reach the lowest possible eigenratio @xmath0 , which guarantees on its turn maintenance of the stability of the synchronous state across the longest possible range of coupling strengths in class iii systems .",
    "far from constituting a merely theoretical proposition , we have proved the feasibility , effectiveness and robustness of the method by means of an experiment with chaotic electronic oscillators , this way validating the technique also in the case of non perfectly identical systems .",
    "furthermore , our experiment allowed to monitor the propagation of the synchronization error throughout the network , as the system approaches the synchronization boundaries , as well as to analyze the effects of deviations from the optimal topology ( the maximally synchronizable configuration ) elucidating the crucial interplay between _ topological noise _ and the coupling strength of the whole network .",
    "our results are therefore useful as a guide for implementation of the method in other networked dynamical systems , as well as for engineering topologies of specific subgraphs of a larger network wherein one would desire synchronization dynamics to be supported and kept across a large variability of global parameters , such as the coupling strength .",

    "it is necessary to load the desired network topology so that the interface can define the links connecting the nodes .",
    "then , the time series of all variables of an isolated rssler oscillator circuit ( @xmath132 ) is recorded via an analogue - digital converter ( adc ) , with a sampling rate of 100 @xmath82 ( kilosamples per second ) and a 12 -bit resolution .",

    "importantly , the interface digitally performs the sum of the different signals entering a given node , after multiplying each of these by the appropriate link weight ( @xmath8 ) and network strength ( @xmath2 ) according to the connectivity matrix previously defined .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the coupling circuit has a digital control stage , which allows changing the coupling between nodes autonomously , thus conducting experiments with networks with a large number of elements is possible and only limited by the storage capacity on the hard drive of the computer ."
