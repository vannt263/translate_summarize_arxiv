    "the thermodynamics of strongly correlated fermi systems at high pressures are of growing importance in many fields , including shock and laser plasmas , astrophysics , solids and nuclear matter , see refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "in particular the thermodynamical properties of hot dense plasmas under high pressure are of importace for the description of plasmas relevant for laser fusion @xcite . further among the phenomena of current interest",
    "are fermi liquids , metallic hydrogen @xcite , plasma phase transition , e.g. @xcite and references therein , bound states etc . , which occur in situations where both coulomb _ and _ quantum effects are relevant",
    ". there has been significant progress in recent years to study these systems analytically and numerically , see e.g. @xcite . due to the enormeous difficulties to develop analytical descriptions for hydrogen plasmas with strong coupling , e.g. @xcite",
    ", there is still an urgent need to test the analytical theory by an independent numerical approach .",
    "an approach which is particularly well suited to describe thermodynamic properties in the region of high pressure , characterized by strong coupling and strong degeneracy , is the path integral quantum monte carlo ( pimc ) method .",
    "there has been remarkable recent progress in applying these techniques to fermi systems , for an overview see e.g. refs .",
    "however , these simulations are essentially hampered by the fermion sign problem . to overcome this difficulty , several strategies have been developed to simulate macroscopic coulomb systems @xcite : the first is the restricted pimc concept where additional assumptions on the density operator @xmath4 are introduced which reduce the sum over permutations to even ( positive ) contributions only .",
    "this requires knowledge of the nodes of the density matrix which is available only in a few special cases , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , for interacting macroscopic systems , these nodes are known only approximately , e.g. @xcite , and the accuracy of the results is difficult to assess from within this scheme .",
    "an alternative are direct fermionic pimc simulations which have occasionally been attempted by various groups @xcite but which were not sufficiently precise and efficient for practical purposes .",
    "recently , three of us have proposed a new path integral representation for the n - particle density operator @xcite which allows for _ direct fermionic path integral monte carlo _ simulations of dense plasmas in a broad range of densities and temperatures . using this concept we computed the pressure and energy of a degenerate strongly coupled hydrogen plasma @xcite and the pair distribution functions in the region of partial ionization and dissociation @xcite .",
    "this scheme is rather efficient when the number of time slices ( beads ) in the path integral is less or equal 50 and was found to work well for temperatures @xmath5 . in this paper we derive further improved formulas for the pressure and energy and give , for the first time , a detailed derivation of all main results and rigorously justify the use of the effective quantum pair potential ( kelbg potential ) in direct pimc simulations .",
    "further , in the present work this method will be applied to high - pressure plasmas ( @xmath6 mbar ) in such temperature regions were considerable deviations from the ideal behavior are observed .",
    "one difficulty of pimc simulations is that reliable error estimates are often not available , in particular for strongly coupled degenerate systems .",
    "moreover , in this region no reliable data from other theories such as density functional theory or quantum statistics , e.g. @xcite , are available which would allow for an unambiguous test .",
    "furthermore , results from classical molecular dynamics simulations exist , but they apply only to fully ionized and weakly degenerate plasmas , e.g. @xcite , which is outside the range of interest for this work . also , new quantum molecular dynamics approaches are being developed , e.g. @xcite , but they are only beginning to produce accurate results .    therefore , it is of high interest to perform quantitative comparisons of independent simulations , such as restricted and direct fermionic pimc , and to develop improved analytical approximations , which is the aim of this paper .",
    "we compare recent results of militzer et al .",
    "@xcite for pressure and energy isochors ( @xmath7 ) of dense hydrogen to our own direct pimc results .",
    "this is a non - trivial comparison since the two approaches employ independent sets of approximations .",
    "nevertheless , we find very good agreement for temperatures ranging from @xmath8 to as low as @xmath9 .",
    "this is remarkable since there the coupling and degeneracy parameters reach rather large values , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the plasma contains a substantial fraction of bound states .",
    "further , we use the new data to make a comparison with analytical estimates which are based on pad approximations for strongly ionized plasmas .",
    "these formulae were constructed on the basis of the known analytical results for the limiting cases of low density @xcite and high density @xcite .",
    "these pad approximations are exact up to quadratic terms in the density and interpolate between the virial expansions and the high - density asymptotics @xcite .",
    "we find that the results for the internal energy and for the pressure agree well with the pimc results in the region of the density temperature plane , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we now our direct pimc scheme .",

    "there are two different approaches to evaluate this expression .",
    "one is to first choose an approximation for the high - temperature density matrices @xmath41 and then to perform the differentiation .",
    "the other way is to first differentiate the operator expression for @xmath49 and use an approximation for the matrix elements only in the final result .",

    "@xcite .",
    "let us now turn to a comparison of the numerical results .",
    "the restricted pimc simulation data for dense hydrogen are taken from ref .",
    "a comparison of results for the pressure and the internal energy for a fixed value of the density ( @xmath137 ) is shown in fig . 1 and table i. at high temperatures , above 50,000 k , where only a small fraction of atoms is expected , the agreement is rather good .",
    "this is remarkable since the nonideality and the degeneracy reach values of 3 and 10 , respectively .",
    "this result demonstrates that , at least for @xmath138 and for @xmath139 both methods yield results which are more or less equivalent . at @xmath140 , where partial ionization is expected ,",

    "both pimc methods become less reliable , and a detailed analysis , although being very desirable , will have to be based on more extensive calculations in the future .",

    "i also pad results for the weakly nonideal region .",
    "we find good agreement with the pimc results for @xmath142 k. details on the method of these analytical calculations will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we give a comparison of the available data points from direct pimc calculations with analytical estimates based on pad approximations for strongly ionized plasmas @xcite .",
    "the comparison concentrates on h - plasmas in a region in the density - temperature plane with the following borders @xmath143 which will be called  rhomb of moderate nonideality and moderate degeneracy  ( see bold rhomb in fig .  1 ) . with respect to analytical treatment , this rhombic region is of particular difficulty since none of the known analytic limiting expressions is valid .",

    "we demonstrate below that the pad approximations which interpolate between the limits where theoretical results are available are a useful tool for the description of the available data points , at least for the case of moderate nonideality @xmath146 and moderate degeneracy @xmath147 .",
    "the pad approximations which we use here were constructed in earlier work , @xcite , from the known analytical results for limiting cases of low density @xcite and high density @xcite .",
    "the structure of the pad approximations was devised in such a way that they are analytically exact up to quadratic terms in the density ( up to the second virial coefficient ) and interpolate between the virial expansions and the high - density asymptotic expressions @xcite .",
    "the formation of bound states was taken into account by using a chemical picture .",
    "this means the plasma is considered as a mixture of free electrons , free ions , atoms and molecules which are in chemical equilibrium , being described by mass action laws or minimization of the free energy @xcite .",
    "we follow in large here this cited work , only the contribution of the ion - ion interaction which is , in most cases , the largest one , was substantially improved following recent work of kahlbaum , who succeeded in describing the available classical monte carlo data for the ions by accurate pad approximations @xcite . by using kahlbaum s formulas",
    "we achieve a rather accurate description of the thermodynamics in the region where the plasma behaves like a classical one - component ion plasma imbedded into a sea of nearly ideal electrons .",
    "this is the region where the electrons are strongly degenerate @xmath148 and the ions are still classical but nonideal @xmath149 this region lies in the upper left corner of fig .  1 .    with respect to the chemical picture",
    "we restrict ourselves to the region of strong ionization where the number of atoms is still relatively low and where the fraction of molecules is small as well , see below .",
    "we will discuss here only the general structure of the pad formulae .",
    "for example , the internal energy density of the plasma is given by    @xmath150    here @xmath151 is the internal energy of an ideal plasma consisting of fermi electrons , classical protons and classical atoms , and @xmath152 is the interaction energy @xmath153 the interaction contribution to the internal energy consists of four terms :    * ion - ion interaction contribution : this term which , in general , yields the largest contribution is generated by the ocp subsystem of the protons . for the ocp energy of protons many expressions are available , e.g. @xcite . we have used here the most precise formula due to kahlbaum @xcite which interpolates between the debye region , @xmath154 , and the high density fluid , @xmath155 .",
    "* electron - electron interaction : this term corresponds to the ocp energy of the electron subsystem .",
    "we used the rather simple expressions used in earlier work @xcite . *",
    "electron - proton interaction : this term corresponds to the interaction between the two ocp subsystems which is mostly due to polarization effects .",
    "again , we used the rather simple expressions proposed in earlier work @xcite .",
    "* van der waals contribution : in the region of densities and temperatures defined above this contribution gives only a small correction .",
    "therefore , this term was approximated here in the simplest way by a second virial contribution .",
    "the neutral particles were treated as hard spheres .    in the region of densities which are studied here , molecules do not play a role , therefore , the formation of molecules was taken into account only in a very rough approximation according to ref .",
    "the number density of the neutrals was calculated on the basis of a nonideal saha equation .",
    "we restricted this comparison to a region where the number density of neutrals is relatively small , the degree of ionization being larger than @xmath156 .",
    "the contributions to the pressure were calculated , in part , from scaling relations e.g. we used @xmath157 , and , for the other ( smaller ) contributions , by numerical differentiation of the free energy given earlier @xcite . in a similar way , the chemical potential which appears in the nonideal saha equation was obtained . for the partition function in the saha equation we used the brillouin - planck - larkin expression @xcite .",
    "the solution of the nonideal saha equation which determines the degree of ionization ( the density of the atoms ) was solved by up to 100 iterations starting from the ideal saha equation .",
    "since all the expression described so far are given in analytic form , the calculation of about 1000 data points for energy and pressure takes less than a minute on a pc . the result of our calculations for density - temperature points in the `` rhomb of moderate nonideality and moderate degeneracy '' are given in figs .",
    "further , we give in tab .",
    "i several data points obtained from the pad formulas .",
    "since the pad formulas used here do not apply to low temperatures , we included in tab .",
    "i only pad data for @xmath158 .    summarizing the results for the internal energy and for the pressure we find that the pad results , with a few exceptions , agree well with the pimc data in the region of the density temperature plane , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for the energies .",
    "[ the larger deviations for the pressure may be due to the numerical differentiation . ] in fact , the pad formulas used here in combination with the chemical picture works only in the case that the plasma is strongly ionized , i.e. the degree of ionization is larger than @xmath161 . the description of the region where a higher percentage of atoms and , due to this , also molecules is present needs a more refined chemical picture @xcite .",
    "finally , we compare the pad and pimc data along the isotherm @xmath145 which is given in fig .",
    "this figure shows the transition from a classical ideal gas ( low density ) to a nearly ideal quantum gas ( limit of high density ) . in the central part , @xmath162",
    ", coulomb interaction leads to strong deviations from the behavior of an ideal plasma .",
    "the strong increase of the energy at high density is due to the mott effect and to the increase of the ideal quantum contribution to the electron energy . comparing the pad and pimc results",
    ", we find good agreement up to electron densities @xmath163 . for higher densities ,",
    "the deviations are growing . for intermediate densities , @xmath164 the pimc data are more reliable . on the other hand , in the limit of very high density , @xmath165 ,",
    "the pad results are known to correctly approach the ideal quantum plasma limit whereas the pimc data should be regarded as preliminary due to the extremely high electron degeneracy .",
    "interestingly , we find that at high density the pad data approaches the ideal curves earlier than the pimc data which is important for further improvement of the presented monte carlo approach .",
    "this work is devoted to the investigation of the thermodynamic properties of hot dense partially ionized plasmas in the pressure range between 0.1 and 100 mbar .",
    "most of the new results are based on a quantum monte carlo study of a correlated proton - electron system with degenerate electrons and classical protons . in this paper",
    ", we gave a detailed derivation of improved estimators for the internal energy and the equation of state for use in direct fermionic path integral simulations .",
    "also , we gave a rigorous justification for the use of an effective quantum pair potential ( kelbg potential ) in pimc simulations .",
    "further , we compared our direct pimc results with independent restricted pimc data of militzer and ceperley for one isochor corresponding to @xmath166 , fig .",
    "2 . we found very good quantitative agreement between the two pimc methods for temperatures in the range of @xmath167 , where @xmath2 and @xmath168 .",
    "this region is particularly complicated as here pressure and temperature ionization occur and , therefore , an accurate and consistent treatment of scattering and bound states is crucial .",
    "this agreement is remarkable because the two simulation methods are completely independent and use essentially different approximations .",
    "we , therefore , expect that the results for the thermodynamic properties of high pressure hydrogen plasmas in this temperature - density range are reliable within the limits of the simulation accuracy .",
    "this is the main result of the present paper .    in future work",
    ", it will be important to extend the range of agreement . to analyze the deviations between the simulation methods",
    ", we also included some data for @xmath166 and lower temperatures , @xmath169 , fig .  2 .",
    "at this point , no conclusive answer about the reasons of the deviations can be given .",
    "for these parameters , the electron degeneracy is growing rapidly and , therefore , each of the simulation methods is becoming less reliable .",
    "so these data should be regarded as preliminary results which will be useful for future improvements of the simulations .",
    "furthermore , the monte carlo results allowed us to develop and test analytical approximations of pad - type which are improvements of earlier approximations @xcite in a region in the density - temperature plane bounded by @xmath159 and @xmath170 .",
    "this is a region of _ moderate nonideality and degeneracy and high degree of ionization_. we have shown that for these parameters , the pad approximations which interpolate between the limits where theoretical results are available agree well with the monte carlo data , cf .",
    "figs .  2 - 4 and table i. thus , these approximations provide a useful tool for the description of these plasmas which include hydrogen at a pressur between 0.1 and 100 mbar . at lower temperature",
    ", deviations from the monte carlo data are growing , cf .",
    "this is mostly due to the growing role of bound states .",
    "whether the pad approximations , in combination with an improved chemical picture ( mass action law ) , continue to work at lower temperatures , has still to be explored , first steps are under way @xcite .    also , we showed some data for @xmath171 and higher pressure , up to @xmath172 mbar , fig .  5 . here",
    "the monte carlo simulations are particularly difficult due to the high electron degeneracy , and they can benefit from the pade simulations , as the latter correctly reproduce the high - density limit , @xmath165 .",
