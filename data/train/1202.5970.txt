    "it is a simple and rather small step forward from this definition to consider the collection of all apparent horizons in the sense of he , and retain the name ah for the 3-dimensional hypersurface thus formed .",

    "the name `` light collapse region '' ( lcr ) is proposed here .",
    "unlike aah and ah , which are 3-dimensional hypersurfaces in spacetime , the lcr is a 4-dimensional subset of spacetime because the family of geodesics defining it is not uniquely determined .",

    "this is because the geodesics that define the lcr are not uniquely determined : the @xmath148 in ( [ 5.4 ] ) depends on the direction of the geodesic considered and takes a range of values at a given @xmath149 .",
    "consider the intersection of lcr with the aah , i.e. a locus where ( [ 4.8 ] ) and ( [ 5.6 ] ) hold simultaneously . within this set we have @xmath150 .",

    "the definition of this set is identical to the definition of aah , eq .",

    "the other three possibilities listed in the table are allowed .    as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows , even if part of the ingoing branch of the ah is timelike , a null curve crossing the ah outwards from the inside will be trapped in the funnel formed by the aah around @xmath68 .",
    "whether it later crosses the aah or not , it will be forced to hit the big crunch within a finite segment of its affine parameter .",
    "where the ah is spacelike , a null line that crossed it once can not cross it again without being redirected toward the past .",
    "this shows that in its outgoing part the ah acts as a black hole surface , even in that region where the aah is inside it .",
    "the conclusion is that the true horizon is the ah rather than the aah .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the following consideration . if a portion of the szekeres manifold , of finite spatial diameter , is matched to the schwarzschild solution , then , from ( [ 7.6 ] ) , the ah matches to the schwarzschild event horizon .",
    "thus , no signal can escape to infinity if it was within the szekeres ah while crossing the outer surface at @xmath231 .",
    "the intersection of the aah with the outer surface of the szekeres ball leaves no trace in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "in particular , this happens in that part of the szekeres region , where the aah is earlier than the ah ( e.g. in the left half of fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the above considerations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , which shows a family of the nearly radial nongeodesic null lines ( nrnl ) for the model discussed in sec .",
    "[ aahexplia ] .",
    "it is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but for clarity we only show one part of it , where the ah is below the aah .",
    "calculations showed that , depending on the direction and the value of @xmath74 , both the aah and ah can be spacelike or ingoing timelike .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the behaviour in the direction of maximal contribution from @xmath193 . in this direction",
    "the aah@xmath183 is everywhere spacelike , while the ah is ingoing timelike for @xmath247 ( the vertical line in fig . [ fig9 ] ) and spacelike for @xmath248 . in other directions parts of the aah can be timelike . the location of the border between the ingoing timelike and spacelike parts of the ah is direction - dependent , as follows from ( [ 7.10 ] ) .",
    "( this is so because the slope of the null cone generator is direction - dependent , as seen from ( [ 7.9 ] ) ) . in neither case",
    "can the aah or the ah be outgoing timelike . thus , even if in some regions radial null rays can propagate toward increasing @xmath0 , they can not escape from inside the ah and eventually they cross the aah .",
    "in order to gain a deeper insight into the quasispherical szekeres geometries we have investigated the spatial relation between the apparent horizon ( ah ) as defined by szekeres @xcite and the absolute apparent horizon ( aah ) .",
    "the concept of the aah was first introduced by hellaby and krasiski @xcite , but under the name of ah . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this spatial relation was investigated at a general level , at which it was not possible to give graphical examples .",
    "such graphical examples are given here in the simple subcase of the szekeres model defined by ( [ 6.1 ] )  ( [ 6.2 ] ) and ( [ 6.5 ] ) .",
    "the examples illustrate what was said in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the aah `` is a kind of oval with half inside @xmath7 and half outside '' .",
    "the shape of this `` kind of oval '' is shown here in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "an observer who would fall into the region between the surfaces of aah and ah ( top part of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] between the solid surface and dotted surface ) for a short while would have a chance to send a message some distance outwards ( i.e on a path with increasing @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is because in a general szekeres model the hypersurface at which the light rays begin to converge ( the ah ) does not coincide with the hypersurface at which all rays are forced to proceed toward decreasing areal radius @xmath0 ( the aah ) .",
    "however , the signal can not proceed far enough to escape the ah .",
    "moreover , if the szekeres spacetime is matched to the schwarzschild spacetime , the ah finds its prolongation in the schwarzschild event horizon .",
    "consequently , it is the ah that acts as a true horizon .",
    "whether the concept of aah can be usefully applied to astrophysical considerations about galactic black holes remains to be seen .",
    "for this purpose , the current position of the ah in space , inside the galaxy chosen for observation , would have to be precisely determined , which seems to be a rather remote possibility .",
    "we prove here that ( [ 4.11 ] ) is fulfilled by only one value of @xmath249 for each set of values of @xmath250 .",
    "we begin by recalling the following :    \\1 .",
    "equation ( [ 4.11 ] ) that determines @xmath251 on the aah is derived from ( [ 4.7 ] ) , and so all quantities in it are calculated along the nearly radial nongeodesic null line ( nrnl ) that obeys ( [ 4.4 ] ) with @xmath185 and @xmath186 being constant , i.e. @xmath252    \\2 .",
    "note , from ( [ 2.3 ] ) , that @xmath253 at every fixed @xmath250 , so @xmath254 is a monotonic function , in this range , i.e. @xmath255 for every fixed @xmath250 .",
    "now suppose that ( [ 4.11 ] ) has more than one solution for @xmath256 at a given @xmath250 , and call the solutions @xmath257 , with @xmath258 .",
    "then ( [ a.2 ] ) implies that there would be @xmath259 instants @xmath260 , at which the given nrnl would intersect the aah , all the @xmath261 corresponding to the same @xmath250 in ( [ 4.11 ] ) .",
    "our supposition thus implies that the inverse function to @xmath262 has the property @xmath263 .",
    "since this function is continuous ( even differentiable , see ( [ a.1 ] ) ) , this means that for some @xmath264 we have @xmath265 .",
    "but from ( [ a.1 ] ) we have @xmath266 this can be zero only where @xmath267 .",
    "this set is a neck @xcite ",
    "an analogue of the kruskal ",
    "szekeres wormhole in the schwarzschild solution .",
    "i.e. a special location in spacetime that may or may not exist , depending on whether @xmath73 attains the value @xmath268 anywhere .",
    "thus , for every nrnl obeying ( [ a.1 ] ) that does not traverse a neck , @xmath269 everywhere along it .",
    "this means that @xmath263 can not happen , i.e. that ( [ 4.11 ] ) has only one solution for @xmath256 at each given @xmath250 .",
    "for the numerical calculation we need to know the value of the function @xmath271 in ( [ 4.12 ] ) at @xmath168 .",
    "this has to be calculated exactly because numerical programs are unreliable in calculating limits . from ( [ 6.1 ] ) and ( [ 6.3 ] )",
    "we have @xmath272 so @xmath273 in order to calculate @xmath274 we use ( [ 4.11 ] ) . equation ( [ 4.15 ] ) shows that @xmath275 is finite in the full range @xmath276 $ ] .",
    "we take @xmath74 as the @xmath22-coordinate and observe from ( [ 2.1 ] ) that with @xmath173 given by ( [ 6.5 ] ) , @xmath277 will be finite at @xmath168 .",
    "then , substituting ( [ 6.1 ] ) and ( [ 6.3 ] ) in ( [ 4.11 ] ) we get @xmath278 ( because @xmath279 all along the aah ) .",
    "this is possible only when @xmath280 , which , in the collapse phase , means @xmath281 using this in ( [ b.2 ] ) we obtain @xmath282 i.e. the aah at @xmath168 coincides with the big crunch .",
