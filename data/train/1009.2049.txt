    "in the standard model ( sm ) the only source of flavor violation arises from the yukawa couplings . in the limit of vanishing quark masses",
    "the sm lagrangian acquires a large global symmetry ( known as flavor or horizontal symmetry ) mixing sm fermions of different generations .",
    "it is quite tempting to impose such a symmetry on the physics beyond the sm in order to suppress extra flavor violation . in the extreme case where all new physics effects are flavor universal up to small corrections satisfying the full flavor symmetry and proportional to the sm yukawa ,",
    "the scale of such new physics can be a tev .",
    "this idea , known as minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) is quite old @xcite , but recently is gaining ever more interest ( see @xcite ) as a consequence of the persistent failure to find flavor violation beyond the standard model .",
    "the idea of assuming horizontal symmetries to be true symmetries of nature is even older @xcite .",
    "unfortunately such assumption itself is not enough to suppress flavor violation below the experimental bounds when the flavor symmetry is broken at low scales .",
    "the classical arguments against low - scale flavor symmetry work as follows ( see , , @xcite for a nice review ) . in order to produce the sm yukawa couplings flavor symmetry must eventually be broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of some field ( `` flavon '' ) .",
    "this implies the presence of massless goldstone bosons ( gb ) and bounds from hadron decays and astrophysics on such states are even stronger than those from flavor physics .",
    "of course gbs can be easily avoided by gauging . in this case",
    ", however , there are flavor gauge bosons that mediate dangerous flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and their masses must be well above the tev scale .    even requiring that the only sources of flavor breaking are the sm yukawas is not enough to avoid large fcnc from the flavor gauge bosons . indeed if the masses of the gauge bosons are proportional to the sm yukawa couplings , they generate tree - level four - fermion operators proportional to inverse powers of the sm yukawa couplings , enhancing fcnc among the first generations .",
    "therefore despite the fact that the only spurions breaking flavor are the sm yukawa couplings , as in mfv , inverse powers of the spurions appear in the higher dimensional operators , producing _ de facto _ `` maximal '' flavor violating operators .",
    "this argument shows how mfv models can not arise directly from having a fundamental flavor symmetry in the underling theory but rather from accidental ones .    in the classical argument against low - scale flavor gauge bosons sketched above we",
    "can easily identify a way out .",
    "if the fields breaking the flavor symmetry are instead proportional to the inverse of the sm yukawa couplings , the effective operators generated by integrating out the flavor gauge bosons will be roughly proportional to positive powers of the yukawa couplings , suppressing flavor violating effects for the light generations , much like in mfv models .",
    "the spectrum of the extra flavor states , controlled by the flavon vevs , will thus present an inverted hierarchy , with states associated to the third generation much lighter than those associated to the first two .",
    "models implementing this inverted hierarchy were first introduced in @xcite .    remarkably , as we will show in this paper , the mechanism described above is automatic in the minimal extension of the sm with gauged flavor symmetries . with just the sm fermion content the full sm plus",
    "flavor gauge group would be anomalous .",
    "extra flavorful fermions have to be added to cancel these anomalies .",
    "such fermions are also welcome as they can make the sm yukawa terms arise from a renormalizable lagrangian , now that the yukawa couplings have been uplifted to dynamical `` flavon '' fields .",
    "the smallest set of fermions canceling all anomalies leads automatically to the inverted - hierarchy structure mentioned above .",
    "the quantum numbers of these extra fermions are indeed such that the mixing with the sm fermion is flavor diagonal while their masses are proportional to the flavon vevs .",
    "the sm fermion masses arise via a see - saw like mechanism , after integrating out the extra fermions , and are thus proportional to the inverse of the flavon vevs .",
    "all non - sm particle masses ( fermions , vector bosons and flavon fields ) are controlled by the flavon vevs , thus they are roughly proportional to the inverse of the sm yukawa .",
    "the resulting inverted hierarchy in the new physics sector protects the sm fermions from getting large flavor breaking effects even when the lightest new states lie at the electroweak scale .",
    "there are a number of analogies with mfv models : new physics effects are controlled by the flavor group , we may have models where only one spurion for each sm yukawa matrix breaks the flavor symmetry , and the flavor breaking effects follow the hierarchical structure of the yukawa couplings .",
    "however , this kind of models are not mfv . indeed , in these models there is a limit",
    "where all yukawa couplings vanish but flavor breaking effects remain finite . contrary to the naive intuition that flavor violating effects must be larger than in mfv , it is very easy to find values of the parameters that produce extra flavor non - universal states without incurring into a flavor problem .",
    "moreover , unlike in mfv , these could be light , even below the electroweak scale .",
    "the tightest bounds on this kind of models do not come from flavor breaking observables but rather from electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) and direct searches for new particles , opening the possibility for direct discoveries of flavor physics at the lhc .",
    "the mechanism protecting from flavor violations is robust against deformations of the model , both when more flavon fields are considered and when the nature of the flavor subgroup that is actually gauged is changed .",
    "of course the detailed structure of the flavor sector as well as the size of the flavor violations will depend on these modifications but the latter will continue to remain sufficiently small in most of the parameter space of the theory .    we should point out that the possibility of having non - universal gauge bosons ( and other flavorful physics ) at the tev scale is well known in the literature . in composite higgs models and similar extra - dimensional constructions , for example , there is the possibility of having extra flavorful gauge bosons . unlike in our case",
    "however , these vector fields are not `` the '' flavor gauge bosons ( _ viz .",
    "_ they are not the states eating the goldstone bosons of the broken flavor symmetry ) , but rather gauge bosons in some non - trivial representation of the flavor group , getting mass splitting from the breaking of the flavor symmetry ( which generically is explicit in these models ) . in this respect",
    "they are closer to realizing the mfv idea  ( see , , @xcite ) .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we give the details on how the mechanism works , we will discuss where the strongest bounds on the model come from and possible signatures at hadron colliders . for definiteness we will focus on the quark sector , gauging the full flavor group and considering mainly the minimal set of flavon fields , although the same mechanism can easily be applied to more general situations .",
    "in the absence of yukawas , focusing on the quark sector , the sm enjoys at the classical level the global symmetry @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 transform as fundamentals .",
    "we assume this to be an exact symmetry of nature . in order to allow yukawa couplings",
    "the flavor symmetry should be broken spontaneously by the vacuum .",
    "this can be most simply realized by the vevs of two bifundamentals flavon fields transforming as @xmath4 in general the vevs of these fields , while related , should not be confused with the yukawa matrices , as functions of @xmath5 may have equal transformation properties .",
    "indeed this will be the crucial feature of our model . to avoid problematic flavor violating gbs , the symmetry should be gauged . within the sm",
    "the gauging of the sm flavor symmetry ( [ flavorsymmetry ] ) is anomalous due to cubic and mixed hypercharge anomalies .",
    "the simplest option to cancel the cubic non - abelian anomalies is to add two right - handed colored fermions in the fundamental of @xmath6 , one left handed fundamental of @xmath7 and one left - handed fundamental of @xmath8 . in this way the fermions are vector - like with respect to the flavor gauge group but remain chiral with respect to the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "the other possibility , with the two right - handed triplets in an @xmath9 doublet is an uninteresting , non - chiral model .",
    "we are therefore led rather uniquely to the following model :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     and with @xmath10 the mass of the lightest ckm mode eigenstate .",
    "the contributions are so suppressed that @xmath11 can be as light as 100  mev without incurring into problems with flavor .",
    "the quantitative results above nicely fit with what is observed in the two flavor case , and the couplings of the canonically normalized ckm modes to the fermions are numerically compatible with the short - hand formula @xmath12 which is similar to the flavor preserving one for the radial modes of the diagonal flavon fields .",
    "in this appendix we derive the one loop expression for the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters in our model .      for simplicity we work in the limit where only the mixing of the top is important .",
    "from the couplings ( [ wcouplings ] ) , ( [ zcouplings ] ) the contribution of the third generation to @xmath14 ( obtained as the difference between the correlators in our model and their sm values corresponding to @xmath17 ) is given by , @xmath18\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the self energies @xmath19 with two left currents . in the limit",
