    "for several reasons , the schur functions can be said to be the most interesting and important basis for the ring of symmetric functions .",
    "while we will study schur functions from a combinatorial perspective , their importance is highlighted by their appearance in various other areas of mathematics .",
    "they appear in the representation theory of the symmetric group and of the general and special linear groups .",
    "they are intimately tied to schubert classes , which arise in algebraic geometry when studying the cohomology ring of the grassmannian , and they are also closely related to the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices . for more information on these and other connections see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the expansions of other symmetric functions in the basis of schur functions .",
    "for example , the skew schur function @xmath0 and the product @xmath1 of two schur functions are two of the most famous examples of _ schur positive _ functions , i.e. when expanded as a linear combination of schur functions , all of the coefficients are non - negative .",
    "schur positive functions have a particular representation - theoretic significance : if a homogeneous symmetric function of degree @xmath2 is schur positive , then it arises as the frobenius image of some representation of the symmetric group @xmath3 . motivated by the schur positivity of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , one might ask when expressions of the form @xmath4 are schur positive , and such questions have been the subject of much recent work , such as @xcite . it is well - known that these questions are currently intractable when stated in anything close to full generality .",
    "putting these questions in the following general setting will help put our work in context .",
    "let us first note that @xmath1 is just a special type of skew schur function @xcite .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider differences of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are skew diagrams .",
    "we could define a reflexive and transitive binary relation on skew schur functions by saying that @xmath7 is related to @xmath6 if @xmath5 is schur positive . to make this relation a partial order",
    ", we need to consider those skew diagrams that yield the same skew schur function to be equivalent ; see the sequence @xcite for a study of these equivalences .",
    "having done this , let us say that @xmath8 { \\leq_s}[a]$ ] if @xmath5 is schur positive , where @xmath9 $ ] denotes the equivalence class of @xmath6 . clearly @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] will be incomparable unless @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same number @xmath2 of boxes , and we let @xmath10 denote the poset of all equivalence classes @xmath9 $ ] where the number of boxes in @xmath6 is @xmath2 . restricting to skew diagrams with 4 boxes",
    ", we get the poset @xmath11 shown in figure  [ fig : p4 ] .",
    "@xmath12    our overarching goal when studying questions of schur positivity and schur equivalence is to understand these posets .",
    "our approach will be to restrict to a particular subposet of @xmath10 and derive necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 { \\leq_s}[a]$ ] .",
    "this contrasts with most of the aforementioned papers , which studied either necessary _ or _",
    "sufficient conditions for @xmath8 { \\leq_s}[a]$ ] .",
    "there are two previous examples in the literature of subposets of @xmath10 for which necessary and sufficient conditions are given .",
    "the first example concerns the class of _ horizontal strips _",
    "( respectively , vertical strips ) , which consists of all skew diagrams with at most one box in each column ( resp .",
    "it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.7 example 9(b ) ) that the poset that results when we restrict to horizontal ( resp",
    ".  vertical ) strips is exactly the dominance lattice on partitions of @xmath2 .",
    "the second example concerns _ ribbons _ , defined as connected skew diagrams with no 2-by-2 block of boxes . in other words",
    ", ribbons are connected skew diagrams with at most one box in each northwest to southeast diagonal . as we will show in lemma  [ lem : length ] , two ribbons are incomparable in @xmath10 unless they have the same number of rows . restricting to ribbons",
    "whose row lengths weakly decrease from top to bottom again results in dominance order , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are ribbons with the same number of rows and with row lengths weakly decreasing from top to bottom , then @xmath8 { \\leq_s}[a]$ ] if and only if the partition of row lengths of @xmath6 is less than or equal to the partition of row lengths of @xmath7 in dominance order .",
    "the next step would be to try to characterize the schur positivity order for general ribbons .",
    "more precisely , we would like conditions in terms of the diagrams of @xmath6 and @xmath7 that determine whether or not @xmath8 { \\leq_s}[a]$ ] . understanding the ribbon case would give insight into many `` portions '' of @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , we show that the subposet of @xmath10 consisting of ribbons with a fixed number of rows is a _",
    "subposet of @xmath10 . however , the general ribbon case is extremely difficult : figure  [ fig : ribbon94 ] shows that the set of ribbons with 9 boxes and 4 rows already yields a complicated poset .",
    "@xmath13    as progress towards a full characterization , we consider _ multiplicity - free _ ribbons , i.e.ribbons whose corresponding skew schur function , when expanded as a linear combination of schur functions , has all coefficients equal to 0 or 1",
    ". for details on the importance of multiplicity - free linear combinations of schur functions , see @xcite and the references given there . for example",
    ", multiplicity - free schur expansions correspond to multiplicity - free representations , the many applications of which are studied in the survey article @xcite .",
    "obviously , our first step is to determine which ribbons are multiplicity - free .",
    "conveniently , this can be deduced from the work of gutschwager and of thomas and yong ; see lemma  [ lem : multfreeribbon ] for the details . in short , a ribbon is multiplicity - free if and only if it has at most two rows of length greater than one and at most two columns of length greater than one .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the poset that results from considering all multiplicity - free ribbons with @xmath2 boxes and @xmath15 rows .",
    "as in the general ribbon case , we show that @xmath14 appears as a convex subposet of @xmath10 .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ th : bigdiff ] , which gives a complete description of the poset @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out to have a particularly attractive form , and is only a slight modification of a product of two chains .",
    "more precisely , @xmath14 can be obtained from a product of two chains by removing some join - irreducible elements . as an example , figure  [ fig : p12_6 ] shows @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the necessarily preliminaries regarding partitions and skew schur functions . in section  [ sec : reductions ] , we investigate general properties within @xmath10 . in particular , we prove our earlier assertions about incomparability of ribbons , and we show that the sets of ribbons and multiplicity - free ribbons each form convex subposets of @xmath10 .",
    "we also show that @xmath10 , the ribbon subposets , and @xmath14 each have a natural partition into convex subposets , where each convex subposet corresponds to a fixed multiset of row lengths .",
    "section  [ sec : fundamental ] contains our main lemmas which determine the edges of the hasse diagram of @xmath14 . in section  [ sec : main ] , we reindex multiplicity - free ribbons in terms of certain rectangles , which allows us to state our main result , theorem  [ th : bigdiff ] , fully describing all the order relations in @xmath14 . this reindexing also explains why @xmath14 closely resembles a product of two chains , and it gives a simple description of the meet and join operations .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] with some remarks about products of schubert classes and a lattice - theoretic property of @xmath14 .",
    "the authors would like to thank hugh thomas for helpful comments .",
    "the littlewood - richardson calculator @xcite and the posets package @xcite were used for data generation .",
    "we begin by reviewing some notions concerning partitions .",
    "we say that a list of positive integers @xmath18 is a _ partition _ of a positive integer @xmath2 if @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath21 .",
    "we call @xmath22 the _ length _ of @xmath23 and we call @xmath2 the _ size _ of @xmath23 , writing @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we call the @xmath25 the _ parts _ of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath26 then we will denote the sublist @xmath27 by @xmath28 . for convenience",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the unique partition of length and size 0 .",
    "two partial orders that exist on partitions are    1 .   the _ inclusion order _ : @xmath30 if @xmath31 for all @xmath32 , 2 .",
    "the _ dominance _ _ order _ : given @xmath33 , @xmath34 if @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "we say that a list of positive integers @xmath37 is a _ composition _ of @xmath2 if @xmath38 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath39 . as with partitions ,",
    "a composition has length @xmath40 and size @xmath41 with parts @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the composition whose parts are the parts of @xmath44 listed in reverse order , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "observe that every partition is a composition and that every composition _ determines a partition _ @xmath46 , which is obtained by reordering the parts of @xmath47 in weakly decreasing order .    given a partition @xmath18 , we associate to it a _ diagram _ , also denoted by @xmath23 , which consists of @xmath48 left - justified boxes in the top row , @xmath49 left - justified boxes in the second from top row etc .",

    "note that there exists a natural bijection @xmath64 between compositions of size @xmath2 and ribbons with @xmath2 boxes that takes the composition @xmath37 and sends it to the unique ribbon that has @xmath42 boxes in the @xmath53th row from the top .",
    "for example the skew diagram in example  [ ex : smallribbon ] is a ribbon and corresponds to the composition @xmath65 .",
    "for ease of notation we will often refer to a ribbon by its corresponding composition from now on .",
    "we conclude this subsection with two operations on skew diagrams .",
    "the first is antipodal rotation , given a skew diagram @xmath66 we form its _ antipodal rotation _",
    "@xmath67 by rotating @xmath66 by 180 degrees in the plane .",
    "observe that if @xmath66 is a ribbon corresponding to a composition @xmath44 then @xmath68 . the second operation is transposition . given a diagram @xmath23 we form its _ transpose _ @xmath69 by letting the leftmost column of @xmath70 have @xmath48 boxes , the second from leftmost column have @xmath49 boxes etc .",
    "we then extend this to skew diagrams by @xmath71 .",
