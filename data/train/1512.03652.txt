    "though the quantum no - clone theorem prohibits the perfect estimation of the unknown state of a single quantum system  @xcite , state reconstruction is possible via repeatedly measuring an ensemble of identical systems , a process usually called quantum state tomography ( qst ) . besides the standard qst strategies  @xcite , a novel tomography strategy , conventionally called _ direct state tomography _ ( dst ) , or weak - value tomography , has been widely investigated both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "dst is based on the quantum weak value theory introduced by aharonov , albert and vaidman ( aav ) in 1988  @xcite . in dst , each element of the unknown density operator is proportional to a single _ weak value _ , if we choose the appropriate variables in weak measurements @xcite . in this way , the wave function at each point can be determined directly , without the global inversion required in standard qst @xcite . because of this feature and the simplicity of experimental implementation ,",
    "dst can be conveniently realized and is probably the only choice for the tomography of high - dimensional states @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in  @xcite , dst suffers from the disadvantages , including low efficiency and systematical reconstruction bias .",
    "it is conceivable that these flaws mainly stem from the aav s weak - value formalism that built on first - order perturbation of the measurement strength  @xcite .",
    "that is , very weak coupling strength causes the low efficiency of dst  @xcite ; approximations produce unavoidable bias  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have constructed a new framework for quantum measurements with postselection  @xcite . in our formalism",
    ", weak value information can be generated exactly with measurements of any strength , provided that two _ coupling - deformed(cd ) pointer observables _ are read on the pointer of the quantum measuring device  @xcite .",
    "the general formula for determining the cd observables was also given in @xcite .",
    "in particularly , when a single qubit is used as the measuring device , it is also reported in refs .",
    "@xcite that weak values can be obtained from stronger measurements by standard state tomography of the qubit device .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a modified dst that works by applying the cd observables @xcite in state tomography ; it will be denoted as mdst hereafter .",
    "since mdst is valid over the full range of measurement strength , we will determine the optimal measurement strength at which mdst attains its highest efficiency .",
    "then , through monte carlo simulations , we demonstrate that the efficiency of mdst is much higher than that of dst .",
    "that is , to reach the same level of reconstruction accuracy , mdst needs far fewer samples . furthermore , mdst is also compared with su(2 ) tomography , one of the most efficient stand qst  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review su(2 ) tomography and dst in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , mdst is studied and the optimal coupling strength is given . in section [ sec4 ] , the performance of different state reconstruction strategies are compared using monte carlo simulation results .",
    "a short conclusion is presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly review su(2 ) tomography , and the original direct state tomography ( dst ) .",
    "su(2 ) tomography is a well - established state reconstruction technique .",
    "it is based on the formula  @xcite @xmath0 , % \\sum_{i}r_i^g \\langle r_i^g|\\rho_{in}|r_i^g\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the unitary irreducible square - integrable representation of a tomographic group @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) can be found in  @xcite . as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , a general unknown state @xmath4 could be reconstructed by a series of projective measurements onto the eigenstates of @xmath5 .",
    "when the tomographic group @xmath2 is selected to be the su(2 ) group , the tomography scheme is called _",
    "su(2 ) tomography _ ( see  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "additionally , standard tomography can be implemented with measurements of the basis operators of the space of density matrices .",
    "for example , an unknown qubit state can be expressed using the pauli matrices @xmath6 by measuring the three pauli matrices , we could reconstruct an unknown two - dimensional state .      the original direct state tomography ( dst )",
    "is based on weak measurements .",
    "suppose a system in unknown state @xmath4 is weakly measured by a pointer in state @xmath7 .",
    "the observables being measured on the system are chosen in the set @xmath8 .",
    "therein , states @xmath9 compose an orthogonal basis of the system s hilbert space . after that measurement",
    "we project the system onto another orthogonal basis @xmath10 of the system s hilbert space , a process conventionally called _ postselection _ ( in this article , _ postselection _ represents the final projective measurement , and no data is discarded in the state reconstruction process . ) .",
    "we then record the outcome of the postselection , read the pointer by the pointer observable denoted as @xmath11 , and generate the the _ weak value _ of each @xmath12 defined as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability of obtaining @xmath15 in postselection . for convenience , the measurement basis @xmath9 and the postselection basis @xmath10 are chosen to be the mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) that @xmath16  @xcite . using the weak values",
    "@xmath17 , we can reconstruct the unknown state using the formula @xmath18 this formula states that no samples are discarded , which is different with the original pure - state tomography case in ref . [ 11 ] . in the direct state tomography strategy of this article ,",
    "each sample is used to construct weak values @xmath17 no matter which of @xmath10 is obtained in postselection .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the setup of @xcite where the pointer is a qubit initialized in pure state @xmath19 , the eigenstate of @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "the weak measurement is described by the unitary coupling @xmath22 where the coupling strength @xmath23 is small .",
    "the weak value is determined via measuring two different observables on the pointer , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 for the real part and @xmath26 for the imaginary part .",
    "they could be @xmath27 the weak value is determined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "that is , the weak value information is obtained by measuring @xmath30 on the joint system .    the validity of eq .",
    "( [ dsm ] ) requires @xmath31 , which implies little information gain @xcite and low efficiency for dst .",
    "however , @xmath23 is small but finite in an actual experiment , thus a systematical error in the reconstruction is unavoidable .",
    "these two disadvantages of dst have been verified by numerical simulations in  @xcite .",
    "a recent work shows that weak value can be obtained exactly with measurements of any strength , if we measure the _ coupling - deformed _ ( cd ) pointer observables given in@xcite . in this section",
    ", we will use this strategy to propose a modified direct state tomography ( mdst ) , and identify the optimal coupling strength which maximizes the efficiency of mdst .      when @xmath32 , we measure the observable @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) on the pointer to get weak value information . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain the exact weak value information by measuring the cd observable @xmath34 that varies with @xmath23 , instead of @xmath11 .",

    "( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "we call this scheme modified direct state tomography ( mdst ) .    by comparing eq .",
    "( [ dsm ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ nwv ] ) , it is straightforward to see that in mdst , no approximation is applied , thus there will be no inherent bias in the reconstruction , and mdst can be implemented with any value of @xmath23 .    here",
    ", we would like to remark that our presentation of dst and mdst is slightly different from others focusing on aav s weak value , for example @xcite .",
    "if using the whole weak value , there will be an unknown normalization factor that can be fixed only after all the measurements are completed @xcite .",
    "this is seen as conflicting with the claim of directness @xcite .",
    "however , in our mdst , eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) clearly shows that one element is directly determined by @xmath40 , which could be obtained from the measurements described in eq .",
    "( [ nwv ] ) .      since in mdst @xmath23 can be any value , we need to search for the optimal strength to obtain the highest efficiency .",
    "first , we derive the optimal @xmath23 by statistical theory . in actual implementation",
    ", mdst suffers from statistical errors .",
    "this is the reason why there is a discrepancy between the true state @xmath41 and the reconstructed state @xmath42 .",
    "statistical errors can be quantified by the variance of the measured results .",
    "lower variance means less random error and higher reconstruction accuracy .",
    "we find that when gauging the performance of mdst by the variance of the reconstruction , the optimal value of @xmath23 will be appealingly state - independent .    from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , each element of the reconstruction @xmath42 @xmath43 is determined by two independent measurements , one for the real part and the other for the imaginary part of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the total variance of the reconstruction state @xmath42 can be defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for the real and imaginary part , respectively . from eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ nwv ] ) , the convention @xmath16 , and the error propagation theory @xcite , the total variance @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ nwv ] ) , the second term in the summation gives the squares of the real or imaginary parts of @xmath44 .",
    "since it is independent of @xmath23 , we only need to focus on the summation of the first term of eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) , which will be denoted as @xmath50 .",
    "using the relation that @xmath51 ( the identity on the system s hilbert space ) , we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 . since @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 which is independent on the input state @xmath41 . for @xmath56",
    ", we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 . since @xmath59 , tv1 is evaluated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the dimension of the unknown state .",
    "tv1 , and thus @xmath62 , attains the minimum at the optimal strength @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the value of tv1 against the coupling strength @xmath64 $ ] is illustrated for the two - dimensional systems . from eq .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) , the minimum of @xmath50 locates at @xmath65",
    ". it may be surprising at first glance that @xmath66 , which makes the coupling unitary eq .",
    "( [ uni ] ) describe the strongest measurement , is not optimal .",
    "our result @xmath67 is also consistent with the result of @xmath68 @xcite , which is calculated using the average fidelity as the figure of merit of the reconstruction of the pure qubit states in the scheme introduced by vallone and dequal  @xcite .    in order to align with the results in @xcite",
    ", we will use the trace distance to quantify the accuracy of the reconstruction . to locate the optimal strength with respect to trace distance , we use the standard monte carlo method to simulate mdst : first",
    ", a two - dimensional mixed state @xmath41 is selected randomly as the target state ; second , the reconstruction @xmath42 is produced by mdst with @xmath69 copies of @xmath41 for different coupling strengths ; third , the trace distance  @xcite between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath70 is calculated to gauge the performance of mdst .",
    "smaller trace distance @xmath71 means higher efficiency . in order to eliminate statistical fluctuations ,",
    "we have averaged @xmath71 over @xmath72 randomly selected @xmath41 .",
    "the simulation results are presented in fig .",
    "it coincides well with the prediction of variance that @xmath67 .",
    "( blue circles ) averaged over @xmath72 states , against the coupling strength . ]",
    "the value of tv1 diverges at the weak limit @xmath31 .",
    "this demonstrates the conclusion that dst at the weak limit suffers serious random noise , which leads to low efficiency .",
    "the exactness of the mdst formalism , and its validity over the entire range of measurement strength suggest that mdst can overcome the problems of low efficiency and intrinsic bias . in this section",
    ", we will examine this claim by using monte carlo simulations to compute the three strategies of quantum state reconstruction : mdst , dst , and su(2 ) tomography .",
    "the simulation goes as follows .",
    "first , a state is reconstructed by mdst , dst , pauli tomography and su(2 ) tomography ; second , the trace distance @xmath73 between the true state @xmath41 and the reconstructed state @xmath42 is used to gauge the estimation efficiency .",
    "given equivalent sample size , the smaller the trace distance is , the higher the efficiency of a tomography scheme will be .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , all the reconstruction strategies are affected by statistical errors",
    ". the trace distances decrease with the the numbers of the copies of the systems .",
    "as expected from the simulation results , the reconstruction @xmath42 of dst has a systematical bias , while the state @xmath42 obtained by mdst has no error bias .",
    "the trace distance @xmath73 continues to decrease as the number of copies increases .",
    "is plotted as the function of the number of copies n of the system .",
    "circles , d calculated from mdst with @xmath74 ; squares , d calculated from dst with @xmath75 ; diamonds , d calculated from pauli tomography ; stars , d calculated from su(2 ) tomography . ]    for quibts , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the efficiencies of mdst , pauli tomography and su(2 ) tomography differ little . for five - dimensional systems , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the relationship between the trace distance and the number of copies is given .",
    "these two figures clearly show that to reach the same level of trace distance , mdst uses far fewer samples than dst . that is to say ,",
    "the efficiency of dst is significantly improved by using stronger measurements and cd pointer observables .",
    "figure [ f3 ] also indicates that mdst is less efficient than su(2 ) tomography .",
    "for the same reconstruction precision , mdst needs more copies than su(2 ) tomography .",
    "this is consistent with the result found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the scheme of haar - uniform randomly chosen one - dimensional orthogonal projective measurements is more efficient than direct tomography methods .    in order to study the gap between the efficiencies of mdst and su(2 ) tomography ,",
    "we have performed further simulations for two , four , five , six , eight , nine , and ten - dimensional systems . in the tables of the appendix",
    ", we list the reconstruction precision gauged by trace distance , and the corresponding samples size @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which are averaged over 500 repeated reconstructions to decrease the statistical fluctuation .",
    "is plotted as the function of the number of copies n of the system .",
    "circles , d calculated from mdst with @xmath78 ; squares , d calculated from dst with @xmath75 ; stars , d calculated from su(2 ) tomography . ]",
    "as indicated in tables i - iii , for the expected trace distances @xmath79 , the results suggest that @xmath80 for two , four and five - dimensional systems , where @xmath61 is the dimension of the systems . in tables",
    "iv - v , for six and eight - dimensional states , it is shown that @xmath81 . in tables",
    "vi - vii , @xmath82 copies are needed in mdst to attain the same precision of su(2 ) tomography for nine and ten - dimensional systems . roughly speaking , we suppose @xmath83 .    from the data obtained in simulations",
    ", we estimate that to reach an equivalent level of reconstruction accuracy , the sample size required in mdst , @xmath76 , is about @xmath84 times of @xmath85 , the sample size required in su(2 ) tomography .",
    "mdst is clearly less efficient than su(2 ) tomography , especially for high dimensional systems .    since su(2 )",
    "tomography is predicted on measuring a complete set of non - commuting observables , a difficult task to realize in actual experiments .",
