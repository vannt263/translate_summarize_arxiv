    "determining distances by use of multiple methods has a long and distinguished history in astronomy from antiquity to the present day .",
    "aristarchus of samos first determined the moon - earth distance from the lunar eclipse .",
    "a century later , hipparchus checked aristarchus values using the independent method of terrestrial parallax : the position of the lunar limb during solar eclipse as seen from alexandria and hellespont .",
    "more recently , astronomers have demanded that multiple methods be employed for zeroing in on the precise parameters governing the currently observed and mysterious accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "pulsating variables have enjoyed a privileged role in the local volume . due to their characteristic light curves and relatively bright absolute magnitudes compared to the bulk of main sequence stars ,",
    "they can easily be identified and readily measured in nearby galaxies . with a local zeropoint for these systems , it is straightforward , modulo metallicity and reddening issues , to determine the distances to external systems .",
    "cepheids , and their more common , albeit fainter , relatives within the instability strip , the x ( rrl ) variables , have been two key elements in the historical endeavor to launch humanity out of the solar system and milky way and into the local cosmos . indeed",
    "the cepheids currently serve as the anchor of the cosmological distance scale , having allowed the most precise measurement the local rate of expansion of the universe , @xmath8 , to date ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 , freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) . in principle",
    ", once properly calibrated , all stars of known absolute magnitude should yield identical measurements of the distances to nearby galaxies .",
    "this has not historically been the case .",
    "in particular , the rrl @xmath9 calibration has varied by almost half a magnitude depending on the method adopted , and , therefore , consistency with the cepheid distance scale as well as other distance metrics has been difficult to establish . as a result",
    ", attempts to determine rrl absolute magnitudes were largely abandoned over the past decade with a few notable exceptions ( e.g. , dambis et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , recently there have been new efforts .",
    "benedict et al . ( 2011 ) used hst trigonometric parallaxes of 5 rrl stars ( including 4 rrab and 1 rrc variable ) to obtain an average @xmath10 .",
    "klein et al . ( 2011 ) recently used mid - ir data from the wise satellite to infer a mid - ir period - luminosity relation .    in this work ,",
    "we present a third measurement of rrl absolute magnitudes using the method of statistical parallax ( s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the large number of rrl that have been discovered in the last decade allow us to make a fresh assault on this issue . historically ,",
    "rrl star distance measurements from s@xmath11  have come in systematically shorter than other distance indicators , in particular cepheids ( barnes & hawley 1986 , hawley et al . 1986 , layden et al .",
    "( hereafter , l96 ) , popowski & gould 1998a , popowski & gould 1998b , gould & popowski 1998 ( hereafter , collectively pg@xmath12 ) , dambis et al . 2009 ) . it",
    "is not yet fully understood why either this method or these two classes of objects should yield different distances to the same galaxies .",
    "thanks to automated synoptic all - sky surveys like the all sky automated survey ( asas , pojmanski 2002 ) , the number of rrl stars that have reliable light curves has increased by a factor @xmath135 relative to the previous  state - of - the - art \" .",
    "the asas program has identified approximately 2000 rrl stars with 300 - 500 epochs of photometry . by obtaining high - resolution spectra for these targets",
    ", we can both measure the radial velocities and metallicities needed for s@xmath11  and address outstanding issues of systematics .",
    "the light curves allow us to accurately determine pulsation phases and permit the measurement of the radial velocity at a single fiducial phase at which the pulsation velocity equals the star s systemic velocity ( see kollmeier et al .",
    "traditionally , obtaining the radial velocity component for rrl was laborious , requiring multiple epochs of spectroscopic observation .",
    "the determination of the phase - velocity relationship for rrabc variables ( liu 1991 , kollmeier et al .",
    "2009 , preston et al .",
    "2011 ) allows a far more efficient strategy for obtaining critical radial velocity information with which to compute s@xmath11  as we discuss further in section 3 .",
    "historically , rrc variables have been either excluded from s@xmath11  analyses or only approximately analyzed .",
    "this is primarily due to two factors .",
    "first , their hotter temperatures make it more challenging to determine abundances from low - resolution , low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra ( see layden 1994 ) and , as a result , these objects can not be robustly classified by population ( halo / disk ) as required by modern s@xmath11 .",
    "however , high - resolution echelle observations circumvent this issue and allow , for the first time , a definitive s@xmath11  analysis from rrc variables alone .",
    "second , there are fewer rrcs relative to rrabs , and it is only now that samples are large enough to perform a robust , self - consistent , pure rrc s@xmath11  analysis .",
    "we analyze our full ( rrab + rrc ) sample in a future work ( kollmeier et al . in preparation ) and restrict our attention here to our rrc sample .    in section 2",
    "we present a brief overview of s@xmath11  to remind the reader of the basic principles of the technique . in section 3",
    "we present our sample selection , observations , data reduction , and analysis methods . in section 4",
    "we review our updated methodology for determining s@xmath11 , the results of which are discussed in section 5 and compared to previous s@xmath11  results in section 6 .",
    "finally , in section 7 we discuss our results in light of recent and historical works on the absolute magnitude scale of rrl variables .",
    "the basic principle that underlies statistical parallax is that the absolute magnitude of any stellar population characterized by a particular velocity ellipsoid should have a single true value when derived from either transverse or radial kinematics of that tracer population .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) determination of the ellipsoid is independent of any assumptions about distance , but the transverse determination requires an assumed value of the absolute magnitude .",
    "the rvs alone yield values for the the velocity ellipsoid in units of @xmath14 .",
    "the proper motions , when scaled by the square root of the flux ( @xmath15 ) , yield values for the velocity ellipsoid in units of @xmath16 .",
    "the ratio of these two is a distance , d , which is the distance that an rrl star would have to be in order to have @xmath17 . and",
    "hence , the absolute magnitude of the rrl stars is @xmath18 .      the basic formulae for computing statistical parallax in the presence of observational errors have been well - established ( clube & dawe 1980a , b ; murray 1983 ; hawley et al . 1986 ; strugnell , reid , & murray 1986 , pg@xmath12 ) .",
    "the method involves a 10-parameter maximum likelihood fit to the kinematic and photometric data : the distance scale @xmath19 , the 3 first moments ( `` bulk velocity '' ) @xmath20 of the sample velocity distribution , and the 6 independent second moments , @xmath21 .",
    "the key parameter of interest for distance scale determination is the value of the true versus assumed fiducial absolute magnitude of the tracer population . @xmath22",
    "the error in determining this distance scaling is given by ( popowski & gould 1998a ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and the last expression is for the ( more intuitive ) isotropic case @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the bulk motion , @xmath27 is the velocity dispersion , and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of stars with accurate rv measurements and @xmath30 is the number of stars with accurate proper motion measurements .",
    "the evaluation in equation  ( [ eqn : spi_err ] ) is for @xmath31 , which is typical of halo rrl samples .",
    "the distance scale accuracy improves as @xmath32 , i.e. , the sample of stars with _ accurate _ proper motions and radial velocities is increased in size .",
    "asas has provided a public catalog of rrl stars identified via high - cadence light curve analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition to photometry from the asas survey , these stars have proper motions from the second usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac-2 ; zacharias et al .",
    "2004 ) , which covers the entire southern hemisphere .",
    "radial velocity information is not published for the majority of the southern sky and what is therefore required are spectroscopically determined velocities for this large sample of objects that has corresponding proper motions and photometry . before beginning our extensive observational program",
    ", we evaluated the suitability of the asas sample for measuring s@xmath11  considering known systematic uncertainties .",
    "we discuss each of these below .",
    "the key underlying assumption of s@xmath11  is that the rrl are a faithful tracer population of a single velocity ellipsoid and do not exhibit poorly mixed kinematics , for example , from coherent stellar streams .",
    "clearly , as one goes to very large distance ( i.e. , the outer halo ) this assumption breaks down as rrl populations become increasingly contaminated by satellite debris on non - mixed orbits .",
    "indeed , this consideration alone prevents us from extending the survey to extremely faint magnitudes where the distances probed preferentially contain such kinematics ( e.g. kollmeier et al .",
    "the distribution of distances for the asas rrc sample is shown in figure  [ fig : distances ] . as can be seen",
    ", the majority of our sample lies within a distance of 4@xmath33 . the solar neighborhood on these scales is known to be sufficiently smooth that our statistics are unaffected by kinematic substructure ( e.g. , gould 2003 ) .",
    "the proper motion errors from ucac-2 are typically 5 - 6 @xmath16 for the majority of the sample corresponding to @xmath34 . at first sight",
    ", the proper motion errors may seem too large to be useful , given that the median distance is about @xmath35kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : distances ] , determined using an initial value for the absolute magnitude scale of @xmath36 ) , and the direction - averaged dispersion is about @xmath37 .",
    "together , these imply that the errors are typically a large fraction of the quantity being measured .",
    "in fact , s@xmath11  is extremely robust with respect to observational errors .",
    "equation ( 17 ) of popowski & gould ( 1998a ) ( hereafter pg98a ) shows that the statistical error should increase by _ only a few percent _ relative to equation  ( [ eqn : spi_err ] ) , given these errors .",
    "we verify that this is actually the case in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "equation ( 18 ) of pg98a shows that one must be careful about systematic errors that can result from _ misestimating _ the size of these errors .",
    "indeed , the s@xmath11  methodology contains an internal check on the proper motion errors .          since s@xmath11  uses apparent magnitudes , it is important to have robust extinction measurements for objects in the sample .",
    "we use the reddenings provided by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( sfd , 1998 ) and a standard extinction coefficient , @xmath38 to determine @xmath39 . of @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt the sfd values until a definitive calibration is agreed upon . ] because many of our sources are at high galactic latitude ( see figure  [ fig : skydist ] ) , this directly gives adequate values for these sources .",
    "we adjust the reported reddening values to account for the finite distance from the plane of our objects . in some instances , our objects are too close on the sky with other field stars in projection to yield reliable asas photometry ( see pojmanski ( 2002 ) for details of asas photometry ) .",
    "these objects are eliminated from our analysis .    with secure photometry and transverse kinematic measurements in hand",
    ", we began our spectroscopic survey .",
    "the observations presented here were made in 2011 and 2012 with the echelle spectrograph mounted on the 2.5 m du pont telescope at las campanas observatory as part of the larger carnegie rrl survey ( carrs ; kollmeier et al . in preparation ) . upon completion , our survey will have moderate signal - to - noise ratio spectra for approximately 1200 rrl stars observable from the southern hemisphere .",
    "the sky distribution of our full survey sample is shown in figure  [ fig : skydist ] .",
    "the grey points show rrab stars and the blue points show rrc stars .",
    "observations were designed to reach snr@xmath41 in the order containing the mg i triplet at 5170  at the target phase .",
    "exposures for a given target bracketed observations of a thar lamp through a 1.5x4-arcsec slit .",
    "the photospheric velocity of rrl stars changes by many @xmath14 over the course of a pulsation cycle .",
    "traditionally , one has taken multiple observations through the pulsation cycle and fit the resultant velocity function ( when the phase is known ) in order to obtain the systemic velocity of the target ( e.g. layden 1994 ) .",
    "we adopt the time - averaged velocity of the pulsation curve as the center - of - mass velocity of the star as detailed in @xcite and @xcite for rrabs .",
    "integration of detailed velocity curves of the rrc variables t  sex , tv  boo , dh  peg , and yz  cap , all measured with the du pont echelle , shows that the pulsation velocity is equal to the star s time - average velocity at phase 0.32 , reckoned relative to maximum light .",
    "our observations were all made as close to this phase as possible , and velocity corrections were applied adopting the following correction : @xmath42 figure  [ fig : phases ] shows the resultant phase distribution for our targets .",
    "note that these velocity corrections are no larger than @xmath43 for any given star .          in order to ensure uniform quality across our sizeable database",
    ", a data reduction pipeline was constructed following kelson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the pipeline divides the reduction process into first processing the calibration frames , and then using these to reduce the science frames and extract spectra .",
    "the calibration stages involve processing the frames for flat - fielding , determining the order edges and y - distortion using sky flats , and obtaining wavelength solutions using a th - ar lamp frame .",
    "once these frames are produced , the science spectra are reduced .",
    "the science spectra are first divided by the processed and normalized flat - field and then wavelength calibrated .",
    "the spectra are then sky - subtracted and the spatial profiles of the resultant 2-d spectra are used to find extraction apertures .",
    "the pipeline takes advantage of parallel processing , which speeds up the reduction process significantly for a large number of objects .",
    "post - extraction processing of the spectra was done with the iraf echelle package .",
    "radial velocities were measured relative to a high snr template of the metal - poor star hd140283 using the iraf fxcor routine .",
    "the template spectrum was taken with the du pont echelle spectrograph in the same configuration as survey stars .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity for hd140283 has been determined , independently in four separate high - resolution studies , to be @xmath44 ( e.g. tsangarides et al .",
    "2004 , aoki et al .",
    "2002 , lucatello et al .",
    "2005 , latham et al .",
    "the cross correlations were made on the wavelength interval 4900   5500 .",
    "objects that were originally classified as rrl stars based on their light curves but , upon inspection of their spectra , were found to be binaries or other non - rrl variables were removed from the sample .",
    "the radial velocity error estimates returned by fxcor are extremely small , so we estimate the true errors by making repeat measurements of the _ corrected _ velocities on a subset of 11 stars . from these",
    "we determine @xmath45 . we add this in quadrature to our mostly tiny formal errors .",
    "we note that , from pg@xmath46 , the velocity errors enter the final result as @xmath47 and so have no practical effect in any case .",
    "we nevertheless include this correction for completeness .",
    "the measurement of absolute abundances for large samples of rrc stars has not been undertaken previously .",
    "we therefore must calibrate our pipeline abundance measurements ( which yield consistent relative abundance determinations ) to the scant data currently available .",
    "based on analysis of the high snr du pont echelle spectrum of rrc variable yz cap , we adopted a single set of atmospheric parameters ( @xmath487000k , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , [ @xmath51/fe]=+0.35 ) for all survey stars .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is somewhat constrained by the small area occupied by rrc stars in the color - magnitude diagram , and our survey spectra are not of sufficiently high snr to determine this parameter independently .",
    "the abundance measurements in rrl stars are relatively insensitive to the adopted values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for our final calibration",
    ", we rely primarily on a detailed study ( govea et al . in preparation ) that examines the sensitivity of rrc abundance determinations with respect to stellar parameters using a small sample of high snr spectra also obtained with the du pont echelle .",
    "this is the only study we know of in which the sensitivity of rrc abundance measurements are systematically studied .",
    "we also compare to the known distribution of rrab metallicities , as a secondary calibration .",
    "we defer a more detailed analysis of this metallicity calibration to a future work where more high snr , high - resolution data are available for comparison ( kollmeier et al . in preparation ) .",
    "pipeline abundance measurements were performed by fitting to a grid of synthetic spectra generated by moog .",
    "spectra reduced by our spectroscopic pipeline were cleaned of remaining noise spikes and smoothed using a 3-pixel boxcar filter . owing to the relatively broad lines in rrl stars , this smoothing has essentially no effect on the abundance determination .",
    "rrl stars are warmer than the sun and generally metal - poor and therefore contain few spectral features beyond 5500 . as our snr is maximized between approximately 4400  and 5500 ,",
    "we therefore used two broad spectral ranges for our synthetic fits : 4400 - 4680  and 5150 - 5450 .",
    "the latter region contains primarily neutral - species transitions as well as the mg i b lines .",
    "the former region has numerous singly - ionized species including ba ii 4554 .",
    "the synthetic spectral grid covers a range of effective temperature ( @xmath55 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath53 ) , metal abundance and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the atomic line lists for the syntheses were begun with the kurucz line database , then refined until a good match was achieved for the spectrum of the sun .",
    "the smoothed synthetic spectra were compared with the observed spectra and the parameters of those with lowest @xmath56 were chosen as fits . in figure",

    "with the kinematic and chemical information measured as described above , we are prepared to segregate our sample into the halo and disk populations .",
    "we convert our proper motions and radial velocities to radial , rotational , and vertical velocities ( @xmath57 ) as per l96 .",
    "we correct these velocities for the dynamical solar motion ( + 9 , + 250 , + 7 @xmath14 ) and we rotate the sun - centric ( @xmath57 ) 3-space velocity to the local frame of the star assuming cylindrical symmetry of the galaxy . the cumulative distribution of these rotation angles is shown in figure  [ fig : angles ] .",
    "note that they span the range of roughly @xmath58 .",
    "the resultant velocities @xmath59 for our sample are shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : disk_halo ] for direct comparison with figure 3 of l96 which shows the same quantities for their sample of rrab stars . similarly , the right hand panel of figure  [ fig : disk_halo ] shows the rotational velocity component as a function of measured abundance for direct comparison with figure 4 of l96 .",
    "it is important to remind the reader again that we are using rrc stars rather than rrab stars as tracers of the velocity ellipsoid , in contrast to l96 . despite this difference in tracer population ,",
    "the kinematics of this sample are similar to those of l96 .",
    "while it is not possible to know with certainty whether any particular star is a member of the disk or halo , we can clearly see a track of stars that has chemical and kinematic properties similar to a disk - like population .",
    "these stars are relatively high metallicity and are rotating in the direction of the sun with similar speed .",
    "the exact demarcation of the disk / halo line is necessarily uncertain .",
    "following l96 , we therefore perform our analysis on subsamples with the aim of determining how sensitive our results are to these uncertainties .",
    "as we will show , they are not .",
    "we identify two halo / disk subsamples .",
    "the first ( halo-1/disk-1 ) considers all stars rightward ( upward ) of the line @xmath60 } - 225 $ ] to be members of the disk / thick disk and they are excluded from the halo population of interest . of our 247 objects ,",
    "this procedure assigns 34 to the disk and 213 to the halo .",

    "( 2004 ) report external tests only on their mean proper motion estimates and not on their error estimates .",

    "they will therefore be ignored in the following discussion .",
    "we first review the basic physics that permit such a test and then present results .",

    "the other , also called `` statistical parallax '' compared the amplitude of the dispersions ( @xmath68 ) in rv and proper motions . in modern s@xmath11 ,",
    "these are done simultaneously in a single fit .",
    "however , the errors in the proper - motion error estimates enter very differently into these two components . for the @xmath68 comparison",
    "an overestimate of the errors leads to a corresponding underestimate of the intrinsic proper motions of the stars , which can be reconciled with the dispersions measured in rv only by placing them further away .",
    "however , for the @xmath20 measurement , which is first - order ( not second - order ) in the proper motions , there is no such effect . if one wished to be completely safe from any such error - bar misestimates , one could in principle choose to just compute the `` secular parallax '' .",
    "however , the maximum likelihood formulation of s@xmath11  permits a more sophisticated approach .",
    "the likelihood function is a direct and sensitive indicator of the consistency of the two components of the s@xmath11  determination when the error bars are systematically rescaled .",
    "table  [ tab : rescale ] shows results for several such rescalings .",
    "the log - likelihood is maximized for a rescaling factor @xmath69 , while @xmath70 yields a log - likelihood that is lower than this @xmath71 .",
    "the probability of this occurring by chance is about @xmath72 . while this is certainly not an impossible statistical fluctuation , neither is there any compelling prior that the ucac-2 errors are exactly as given .",
    "we note that at @xmath73 , @xmath74 , which is very plausibly due to statistical fluctuations . because we do have some prior that these errors are not grossly overestimated , and because there is no statistical evidence that @xmath75",
    ", we adopt this as our best estimate of the errors .",

    "there is also a systematic error of about 0.05 dex in the metallicity scale , and so the mean metallicity at which this estimate is valid .    because the statistical errors are about 3.5 times larger than the systematic errors , a detailed investigation of the latter is not warranted at the present time",
    "this issue will become somewhat more pressing when we combine the analysis of carrs rrab and rrc stars .",
    "table 1 shows a comparison between the errors derived from the the mcmc and those predicted analytically using the formulae of pg98a , which assume zero measurement errors and isotropic sky coverage .",

    "in the main text , we showed that the analytic error estimates derived by pg98a for the 10 s@xmath11  parameters closely approximate the numerical errors in our sample , despite the fact that the analytic treatment assumes zero measurement errors , uniform sky coverage , and no rotation with galactic position . here , we extend the pg98a analytic treatment to the off - diagonal elements of the parameter determinations and compare the resulting correlation coefficients to our numerical values .    integrating equations ( 30)-(35 ) from pg98a over @xmath99 objects uniformly distributed on the sky",

    "this is the underlying reason that the pg98a linearized analysis matches numerical results so closely .",
    "here we derive the appropriate weighting scheme for an ensemble of rrl parallax measurements with different errors in both @xmath9 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "let us consider @xmath123 stars with measured absolute magnitudes @xmath124 and errors @xmath125 and each with perfectly known metallicity @xmath126 . and let us initially assume that the slope of the @xmath127 relation is known but the zero - point is not .",

    "this can be done if we choose @xmath134 in which case @xmath56 is minimized at @xmath135 regardless of @xmath130 .",
    "the error in this estimate is the point at which @xmath56 rises by unity , i.e. , @xmath136 hence , equation([eqn : q ] ) gives the effective metallicity at which the measurement is made .",

    "this result formally confirms one s naive idea that the metallicity error is `` equivalent '' to an additional error in the absolute magnitude , propagated by the slope @xmath152 of the relation .",
