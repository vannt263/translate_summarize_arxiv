    "this work deals with dynamics of populations experiencing intrinsic noise caused by the discreteness of individuals and stochastic character of their interactions .",
    "when the average size @xmath0 of such a ( stationary or quasi - stationary ) population is large , the noise - induced fluctuations in the observed number of individuals are typically small , and only rarely large . in many applications , however , the rare large fluctuations can be very important .",
    "this is certainly true when their consequences are catastrophic , such as in the case of extinction of an isolated self - regulating population after having maintained a long - lived metastable state , with applications ranging from population biology @xcite and epidemiology @xcite to genetic regulatory networks in living cells @xcite .",
    "another example of a catastrophic transition driven by a rare large intrinsic fluctuation is population explosion @xcite .",
    "rare large fluctuations may also induce stochastic switches between different metastable states @xcite ; these appear in genetic regulatory networks @xcite and in other contexts .",
    "less dramatic but still important examples involve large fluctuations in the production rates of molecules on the surfaces of micron - sized dust grains in the interstellar medium , where the number of atoms , participating in the chemical reactions , can be relatively small @xcite .",
    "as stochastic population dynamics is far from equilibrium and therefore defies standard methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics , large fluctuations of stochastic populations are of much interest to physics @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider single - species populations which are well mixed , so that spatial degrees of freedom are irrelevant . to account for stochasticity of gain - loss processes ( in the following  reactions ) and discreteness of the individuals ( in the following  particles )",
    ", we assume a markov process and employ a master equation which describes the time evolution of the probability @xmath1 to have a population size @xmath2 at ( continuous ) time @xmath3 .",
    "if the population exhibits neither extinction , nor a switch to another metastable state or to an infinite population size , a natural goal is to determine the stationary probability distribution of the population size @xcite . for metastable populations  populations experiencing either extinction , or switches between different metastable states ",
    "one is usually interested in the mean time to extinction or escape ( mte ) , and in the long - lived _ quasi_-stationary distribution ( qsd ) of the population size . for single - step processes these quantities can be calculated by standard methods .",
    "the mte can be calculated exactly by employing the backward master equation @xcite .",
    "this procedure yields an exact but unwieldy analytic expression for the mte which , for a large population size in the metastable state , can be simplified via a saddle - point approximation @xcite . in its turn , the qsd of a single - step process can be found , in many cases , through a recursion .    for multi - step processes",
    "neither the mte , nor qsd can be calculated exactly .",
    "many practitioners have used , in different contexts of physics , chemistry , population biology , epidemiology , cell biology , _ etc _ , what is often called  the diffusion approximation \" : an approximation of the master equation by a fokker - planck equation .",
    "the latter can be obtained via the van kampen system size expansion , or other related prescriptions . with a fokker - planck equation at hand ,",
    "the mte and qsd can again be evaluated by standard methods @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation is in general uncontrolled , and fails in its description of the tails of the qsd . as a result",
    ", it gives exponentially large errors in the mte  @xcite .",
    "until recently , the mte and qsd had been calculated accurately only for a few model problems involving multi - step processes .",
    "recently , escudero and kamenev @xcite and assaf and meerson @xcite addressed quite a general set of reactions and developed controlled wkb approximations for the mte and qsd for population switches @xcite and population extinction @xcite .",
    "when necessary , the wkb approximation must be supplemented by a recursive solution of the master equation at small population sizes @xcite , and by the van kampen system size expansion in narrow regions where the  fast \" and  slow \" wkb modes are coupled and the wkb approximation fails  @xcite .",
    "the techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) were formulated directly in the space of population size @xmath2 .",
    "an alternative approach invokes a complementary space which can be interpreted as a momentum space .",
    "the momentum - space representation is obtained when the master equation  an infinite set of linear ordinary differential equations  is transformed into a single evolution equation  a linear partial differential equation  for the probability generating function @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 , a complementary variable , is conjugate to the population size @xmath2 and plays the role of  momentum \" in an effective hamiltonian system which encodes , in the leading order of @xmath6-expansion , the stochastic population dynamics .",
    "one can then perform spectral decomposition of this linear partial differential equation for @xmath4 . in order to describe the stationary or metastable states",
    ", it suffices to consider the ground state and the lowest excited state of this spectral decomposition , whereas higher modes only contribute to short - time transients @xcite .",
    "the ordinary differential equations for the ground state and the lowest excited state are determined by the specific set of reactions the population undergoes .",
    "the order of these equations is equal to the highest order of inter - particle reactions . for example , for two- ( three- ) body reactions the equations are of the second ( third ) order , _",
    "etc_. in general , these ordinary differential equations can not be solved exactly , and some perturbation techniques , employing the small parameter @xmath7 , need to be used .",
    "the momentum - space spectral theory was developed  @xcite for two - body reactions .",
    "here we extend the theory to any many - body reactions .",
    "we also determine , in the general case , the previously unknown boundary conditions for the above - mentioned eigenvalue problems . if there is no absorbing state at infinity , the boundary conditions are  self - generated \" by the demand that the probability generating function @xmath4 be , at any @xmath3 , an entire function on the _ complex _ plane @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we show that , for two - body reactions , the population extinction problem can always be solved by matching the exact solution of a quasi - stationary equation for the lowest excited state ( see below ) with a perturbative solution of a",
    "_ non_-quasi - stationary equation for the same state .",
    "this procedure always works when @xmath0 is sufficiently large . for three- , four- ,",
    "@xmath8 body reactions the spectral decomposition can be used in conjunction with a @xmath5-space wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation which employs the same small parameter @xmath6 but does not rely on exact solution of the quasi - stationary equation .",
    "we find that there is a region of @xmath5 where the wkb approximation breaks down , and a region of @xmath5 where its accuracy is insufficient . in the former region",
    "a boundary - layer solution can be found and matched with the wkb solution . in the latter region a simple _ non_-wkb perturbative solution can be obtained .",
    "the theory extensions presented here turn the momentum - space spectral theory of large fluctuations into a more general tool .    as the evolution equation for @xmath4 is _ equivalent _ to the master equation ,",
    "the @xmath5-space approach is clearly advantageous , compared to the @xmath2-space approach , when the problem in the @xmath5 space admits an exact solution , see refs .",
    "otherwise , the technical advantages of the @xmath5-space approach are not _ a priori _ obvious . in any case",
    ", it provides a viable alternative , and an interesting perspective , to theory of large fluctuations of stochastic populations .",

    "iii deals with a well - studied prototypical chemical reaction scheme which describes a stationary production of hydrogen molecules on interstellar dust grains . here",
    "we show that the wkb approximation not only gives accurate results for the production rate ( including its fluctuations ) of hydrogen molecules , but also yields a complete stationary probability distribution function of the number of hydrogen atoms , including its non - gaussian tails . in sec .",

    "this yields @xmath379 to calculate other @xmath113 terms , one can use a recursion relation obtainable from the master equation ( [ master3 ] ) with @xmath380 . indeed , at @xmath363 one can neglect the terms @xmath381 and @xmath382 compared with the terms @xmath383 and @xmath384 , respectively , and arrive at the following relation : @xmath385 note , that the small-@xmath2 ( [ smalln3 ] ) and the wkb ( [ wkb3b ] ) segments of the qsd have a joint region of validity at @xmath360 .    a comparison between wkb result ( [ wkb3b ] ) and a numerical solution of ( a truncated version of ) master equation ( [ master3 ] ) is shown in fig .  [ prob3b ] .",
    "the inset compares the @xmath386 analytical asymptote [ see eqs .",
    "( [ pi123 ] ) and ( [ smalln3 ] ) ] with numerical results .",
    "excellent agreement is observed in both cases .",
    "it can be also seen that the gaussian approximation ( [ gauss3 ] ) strongly overestimates the qsd in the low-@xmath2 region , and underestimates it in the high-@xmath2 region .",
    "the @xmath5-space representation renders a unique perspective to theory of large fluctuations in populations undergoing markovian stochastic gain - loss processes .",
    "the stationary distribution of the population size is encoded in the ground - state eigenfunction of a sturm - liouville ( spectral ) problem for the probability generating function . in the case of a long - lived metastable population on the way to extinction ,",
    "the mte and the quasi - stationary distribution of population size are encoded in the eigenfunction of the lowest excited state .",
    "the uniqueness of solution in these problems is guaranteed by the condition that the probability generating function is an entire function on the whole complex @xmath5-plane except at infinity . as this work has demonstrated ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the @xmath5-space representation in conjunction with the wkb approximation and other perturbation tools employing a large parameter @xmath29 ( the mean population size in the stationary or metastable state ) yields accurate results for extreme statistics in a broad class of problems of stochastic population dynamics .",
    "such an accuracy is usually impossible to attain via the van kampen system size expansion which approximates the exact master equation by a fokker - planck equation .    how does the @xmath5-space approach compare with the  real \" space wkb method of refs .",
    "@xcite when the stationary or metastable population size is large , @xmath29 ?",
    "one advantage of the @xmath5-space representation is that , for two - body reactions , there is no need in the wkb approximation , as the quasi - stationary equation in this case is always solvable exactly .",
    "another advantage appears when the wkb solution for @xmath4 is valid for every @xmath387 , as occurs in the molecular hydrogen production problem , sec .",
    "in such cases one directly finds the entire probability distribution function , including the region of small @xmath113 . in the real - space approach a separate ( non - wkb ) treatment of the @xmath113 region , and a matching with the wkb - solution valid at @xmath103",
    "would be needed @xcite .    still , from our experience ,",
    "every problem which includes the large parameter @xmath29 , and can be solved in the @xmath5-space , can be also solved in the  real \" space .",
    "furthermore , for populations exhibiting escape to infinity @xcite , escape to another metastable state @xcite , or scenario b of extinction @xcite , the @xmath5-space representation meets significant difficulties .",
    "one difficulty is that one should account for a constant - current wkb solution in these cases @xcite .",
    "the constant - current solution comes from the deterministic line @xmath57 of the phase plane of the underlying classical hamiltonian . in the @xmath5-representation",
    "this line is vertical , as in figs .",
    "[ phasehyd ] , [ phasedb ] and [ phase3 ] , and so the constant - current solution can not be easily accounted for .",
    "in addition , it is unclear how to deal with the region of non - uniqueness of @xmath388 which is inherent , in the @xmath5-representation , in these cases .",
    "there are two wkb solutions in this region , one of them exponentially small compared with the other .",
    "the real - space approach avoids these difficulties , and the solution in these cases can be worked out in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the @xmath5-space representation stems from the fact that the evolution equation for @xmath4 is _ exactly _ equivalent to the original master equation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5-space approach is especially valuable for exact analysis , as illustrated by the example of molecular hydrogen production , see ref .",
    "@xcite and section iii .",
    "finally , generalization of the @xmath5-representation to interacting multi - species populations is quite straightforward , see ref .",
    "the resulting multi - dimensional evolution equation for the probability generating function can be analyzed in wkb approximation .",
    "as of present only the leading - order wkb - approximation for population extinction is available , and this is regardless of whether one uses the @xmath5- or @xmath2-space approach . in the leading wkb order",
    "the problem again reduces to finding a nontrivial zero - energy trajectory of the corresponding classical hamiltonian , and the action along this special trajectory .",
    "this problem can be solved numerically .",
    "if additional small parameters are present , the problem may become solvable analytically , again in both @xmath5- and @xmath2-spaces  @xcite .",
