    "binaries closer than @xmath4 au may even truncate the disc interior to its snow line , suggesting that giant planet formation is inhibited @xcite , although one must recall that the previously mentioned koi-1257 5.3 au binary hosts a 1.45 @xmath5 planet .",

    "[ fig : eb_test]b we produce the same histogram but for exomoon simulations from fig .",
    "[ fig : example_exomoon ] , again with @xmath72 , @xmath30 d and @xmath82 d. compared with the circumprimary case the range of @xmath40 permitting transits on the host is roughly the same .",
    "however , transits on the companion star only occur in a much narrower range of @xmath40 around @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , only 38% of exomoons transited the star did so when the planet _ did not",
    "_ transit .",
    "this suggests that for searches for transiting exomoons it is recommended but not required that the planet transits .",
    "finally , another advantage of a satellite that orbits an eclipsing binary or a transiting planet is that those eclipses / transits would also be identified by a continuous transit survey like _ kepler _ , _ tess _ or _ plato _ and can provide complementary information like eclipse / transit timing variations @xcite .",
    "the equations and n - body simulations in this paper have demonstrated that for circumstellar planets in close binaries and exomoons in planetary systems , orbital precession enhances transit probabilities and makes them inherently time - dependent .",
    "the transit probability of the satellite ( exomoon or circumstellar planet ) on the host body ( for the exomoon that is its planet ) rises roughly linearly over a precession period before plateauing at the value calculated in this paper",
    ". this probability may be as high as tens of per cent , largely as a function of the mutual inclination , and may be reached over a precession period as short as 5 - 10 yr for outer orbits of 100 - 200 d. transits come and go , exhibiting consecutive sequences whenever the satellite s inclination is near @xmath79 .",
    "transits on the companion body ( for the exomoon that is its star ) are systematically less likely but still have a time - dependence , which rises even slightly beyond the precession period .",
    "they may occur at any point during the satellite s precession period but depending on the orbital parameters may be in a sparse sequence and difficult to characterise .",
    "this odd transit signature draws parallels with inclined circumbinary planets @xcite , such as the marginally inclined ( @xmath84 ) kepler-413 @xcite . even if large circumstellar planets in close binaries have individually significant transits , they may be missed by automated detection pipelines that rely on transit regularity . for exomoons",
    "there is the added difficulty of the transits themselves generally being undetectably small , and a clever dynamical phase - folding would be necessary to recover a signal .",
    "searches for circumstellar planets in close binaries are enhanced ( and sometimes guaranteed ) if the binary is known to eclipse , particularly if transits are desired on both stars , but this is not a necessity .",
    "the sample of almost 3,000 eclipsing binaries found throughout the _ kepler _ mission , with more to come particularly from _ plato _ , provides hope of finding such planets _ if _ they exist . to find exomoons transit their star it",
    "is highly recommended that the planet transits too .",
    "finally , we note that this work may be applied to eclipses / transits of close triple star systems and similar - mass binary planets .",
    "thank you to my phd supervisor stephane udry for constant support and discussions , amaury triaud for our circumbinary work that inspired this paper , rosemary mardling for the orbital precession timescale , and jean schneider for the @xcite reference .",
    "this work was aided by the thoughtful comments of an anonymous referee .",
    "finally , i thank the financial support of the swiss national science foundation over the past four years ."
