    "for more than a decade , exciton - polariton physics has boomed , both on theoretical and experimental sides , in applied and fundamental science . in 2012 , polariton - related publications have crossed the line of 2500 citations per year .",
    "this success originates in the very nature of these quasi - particles .",
    "polaritons are formed in vcsel - like semiconductor microcavities of high optical and material quality .",
    "the magnified interaction between confined photons and quantum well excitons leads to the anticrossing of the light and matter resonances , producing these unique quasi - particles .",
    "polaritons take the best of both their components . from the photon",
    ", they inherit the very light mass ( five order of magnitude below the free electron mass due to the steep optical cavity dispersion ) and the coherence . from the exciton",
    ", they inherit the richness of spinor interactions .",
    "but the main interest of polaritons is their bosonic nature .",
    "the demonstration of bose einstein condensation of polaritons@xcite triggered a huge series of seminal works taking advantage of both polaritons bosonic character or interactions : superfluidity,@xcite half - quantized vortices,@xcite solitons,@xcite spin - hall effect,@xcite spin multistability@xcite ...",
    "polaritons have also progressively entered applied physics ; they have been proposed as optical transistors,@xcite all - optical spin memories @xcite , switches@xcite or even for neuronal optical circuitry.@xcite    in this work , polariton multistability is scrutinized by monitoring phase portraits of the polariton system .",
    "the aim is here to illustrate and deepen the understanding of the polariton spin dynamics and in particular the reliability of spin switching experiments realized by cerna et al.@xcite the model used in this article notably includes the formation of a non - radiative reservoir due to the pairing of polaritons into biexcitons.@xcite as experimentally demonstrated , this reservoir plays a crucial role in spin multistability , not only because of the nonlinear losses resulting in its formation but also because of its subsequent interactions with polaritons . here",
    "we demonstrate through phase space analysis that the reservoir formation can be tailored to optimize spin switching processes in polariton systems .",
    "exciton - polaritons are formed due to the strong coupling between the confined photon modes and the quantum well excitons of a semiconductor microcavity .",
    "two polariton modes are produced due to this anticrossing .",
    "they are called lower and upper polariton modes . in the present work",
    "we will focus on lower polariton modes , which show the simplest behavior as they are the ground state of the system .",
    "the lifetime - limited coherence of polaritons ranges between a few picoseconds to a hundred of picoseconds.@xcite nonlinearities due to polariton - polariton interactions are particularly strong compared to other weakly - coupled systems,@xcite .",
    "they are also stronger in materials with weak exciton binding energy such as ingaas and gaas and thus large bohr radii , which unfortunately penalizes large band - gap semiconductors where room temperature lasing can occur , such as zno and gan.@xcite due to their 2d character , polaritons feature a pseudo - spin 1/2 , equivalent to the ellipticity of light in the emission direction of the cavity . in the following",
    "we will mention the two polariton spin projection as @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "the polariton - polariton interaction is highly spin dependent due to pauli exclusion and excitonic complex formation.@xcite the copolarized polariton interaction ( which coefficient is called @xmath2 in the following ) is repulsive while the co - polarized polariton interaction ( @xmath3 ) is usually considered attractive and much smaller than the copolarized interaction .",
    "as detailed below , phenomena such as bistability and multistability highly depend on the linewidth of the polariton resonance .",
    "bistability could be observed in a planar microcavity with q - factor about 5000 ten years ago.@xcite however , spinor multistability is more difficult to observe because of the competition between the polarized modes",
    ". it was first observed in polariton mesas where the particles are confined in the 3 directions , limiting photonic - disorder - induced linewidth broadening ( q - factor about 10000).@xcite the full confinement of polaritons greatly helps to obtain sharp and well defined multistability hystereses as it has been seen experimentally .      to understand polariton bistability",
    "we can first restrict the system to the lower polariton modes and spinless particles .",
    "one can observe polariton bistability by different ways : in a wedged microcavity , where the cavity resonance depends on the spatial position , one can change continuously the detuning between the polariton resonance and the laser line by scanning the excitation spot position of a cw injection laser .",
    "this is the first experimental demonstration of this phenomenon.@xcite reciprocally , one could also scan the wavelength of a tunable cw injection laser at a given place on the sample .",
    "the last possibility is to detune the injection laser above the polariton resonance and vary the injection power .",
    "the latter protocol has been used to observe multistability of confined polaritons.@xcite we will focus on this one in the present article .",
    "the master equation of the bistable polariton system is a simple nonlinear shrdinger equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lower polariton field , @xmath6 , its linewidth and @xmath7 its resonance energy . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath2 refers to the polariton - polariton interaction coefficient .",
    "the cw injection laser field is defined by its amplitude and frequency , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "stationary solutions of this nonlinear equation are obtained by first solving the intensity relation , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13i.\\label{eq : ipoly}\\ ] ] the non - bijective character of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath15 when @xmath16 defines the bistability condition : the laser detuning should be much larger than the resonance linewidth for bistability to occur .",
    "an example of bistability hysteresis is provided in fig.1 a with parameters close to standard polariton systems .",
    "one can then make the polariton field explicit : @xmath17    a convenient way to map the bistability phenomenon consists in the use of phase portraits.@xcite they show an ensemble of trajectories of the nonlinear system for different initial conditions in phase space . in the present case , where @xmath8 is fixed",
    ", phases can be either @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "we will use the latter representation since it provides more straightforwardly information on phase and polarization relations between polariton fields and injection fields . we will use the injection laser phase as the phase reference for the polariton fields .    [",

    "the excitonic component of polaritons gives these composite bosons a unique interaction scheme which does not only consist in repulsive / attractive spinor interactions but also in nonlinear losses due to complex formation .",
    "to understand the dynamics of polariton spin multistability and spin switching , phase portraits are shown to be particularly useful .",
    "we observed the effects of polariton damping and laser - polariton energy detuning on the phase space landscape and linked this analysis to the spin switching phenomenon in a multistable spinor polariton system .",
    "the influence of nonlinear losses and reservoir - induced blueshift are found to play a crucial role in the reliability of tristable spin switching .",
