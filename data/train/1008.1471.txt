    "finally , let us also state that a slightly different combinatorial hopf algebra - the _ core hopf algebra _ - was defined in @xcite ( and independently in @xcite for vacuum graphs ) .",
    "its coproduct does not sum on the class of _ primitively divergent _ subgraphs but on _ all _ subgraphs of the respective graph : @xmath105 the definitions of the coproduct and counit follow in a straightforward manner .",
    "one can then verify that this structure is also a hopf algebra one .",
    "the cohomology of this core hopf algebra was also investigated ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "feynman ribbon graph are a straightforward generalization of the feynman graphs we have seen in the previous section .",

    ".    one can thus think of a ribbon graph as consisting of disks ( vertices ) attached to each other by thin stripes ( edges ) glued to their boundaries . for any such ribbon graph @xmath23 there is an underlying ordinary graph @xmath108 obtained by collapsing the disks to points and the ribbons to edges .",
    "two ribbon graphs are isomorphic if there is a homeomorphism from one to the other mapping vertices to vertices and edges to edges .",
    "a ribbon graph is a graph with a fixed cyclic ordering of the incident half - edges at each of its vertices .",
    "a * face * of a ribbon graph is a connected component of its boundary as a surface .",
    "if we glue a disk along the boundary of each face we obtain a closed riemann surface whose genus is also called the genus of the graph . the ribbon graph is called * planar * if that riemann surface has genus zero . the graph of fig .",
    "[ ex1 ] is planar while the one of fig .",
    "[ ex - graf - ribbon ] is non - planar ( it has genus @xmath88 ) .",
    "we also call a planar graph * regular * if the number of faces broken by external edges is equal to @xmath88 and respectively * irregular * if it is @xmath109 .",
    "the definition of the hopf algebra of non - commutative feynman graphs which drives the combinatorics of renormalization is formally the same as in the commutative case .",
    "as already mentioned it has been proved that the grosse - wulkenhaar model is renormalizable to all orders of perturbation , so such an algebraic structure makes sense also from a `` physical '' point of view .",
    "the class of primitively divergent graphs ( one now has to sum on in the definition of the coproduct ) takes explicitly into account the topology of the graph .",
    "thus , it was proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite and references within ) that the primitively divergent graphs of the grosse - wulkenhaar models are the _ planar regular _ ribbon graphs with @xmath37 and @xmath26 external edges .",
    "we denote by @xmath110 the unital , associative algebra freely generated by @xmath111 ribbon feynman graph .",

    "_ the only thing to prove is the coassociativity of the coproduct .",
    "once this is done , the definition for the antipode follows from the fact that @xmath17 is graded ( by the loop number , as in the commutative case described above ) , connected and from lemma [ lem : sfree ] .",

    "we emphasize here that a cyclic ordering can be defined at the level of this vertex .",
    "one sees that the number of faces to which the edges of that vertex belong is at most four .",
    "some of them may indeed belong to the same face .",
    "the gluing data necessary to the insertion of @xmath77 corresponds to a bijection between the edges of the vertex in @xmath76 and the external edges of @xmath77 .",

    "2 .   for condition [",

    "( qed )    the renormalized feynman amplitudes is defined analogously as in the commutative case ( see previous section ) .",
    "let us end this section by recalling that in @xcite it was also studied in detail the rle played in noncommutative quantum field theory ( both for the grosse - wulkenhaar and for the translation - invariant model @xcite ) by the hochschild cohomology of these types of hopf algebras ; non - trivial examples of @xmath88 and @xmath37 loops have been explicitly worked out .",
    "the main perspective of the combinatorial algebraic approaches presented here is their extension for the study of the renormalizability properties of quantum gravity models .",
    "the group field theory formalism of quantum gravity ( for a general review , see @xcite ) is the most adapted one for such a study , since it is formulated as a ( quantum ) field theory .",
    "these models were developed as a generalization of @xmath137dimensional matrix models ( which naturally make use of ribbon graphs just as noncommutative quantum field theories do ) to the @xmath138 and @xmath139dimensional cases .",
    "the natural candidates for generalizations of matrix models in higher dimensions ( @xmath140 ) are _ tensor models_. in the combinatorial simplest case , the elementary cells that , by gluing together form the space itself , are the @xmath141simplices ( @xmath142 being the dimension of space ) . since a @xmath141simplex has @xmath143 facets on its boundary , the backbone of group field theoretical models in @xmath141dimension should be some abstract @xmath144 interaction on rank @xmath142 tensor fields @xmath25 .    as the size of the matrix in matrix models increases , the scaling of observables promotes the particular class of planar graphs which corresponds to triangulations of the sphere ,",
    "higher genus surfaces being exponentially suppressed .    in a recent paper @xcite it was defined a contraction procedure on a particular family of feynman graphs of the @xmath106-dimensional tensor model , called feynman graphs of type @xmath88 . in commutative field theory ,",
    "all connected graphs can be contracted to points . in a noncommutative quantum field theory on moyal space ,",
    "the planar graphs can be contracted to a non - local moyal vertex ; this does not remain true for non - planar graphs , but renormalizability requires this only for planar graphs .",
    "what it was thus proved in @xcite is that , for the feynman graphs of type @xmath88 , the generalization of these contraction procedures can be defined at the level of the @xmath138dimensional tensor model    it is thus interesting to investigate weather or not these feynman graphs of type @xmath88 can be the primitively divergent feynman graphs of the @xmath138dimensional tensor model .",
    "one proposition for achieving this task is to use using the powerful tool of algebraic combinatorics that were sketched in this review .",
    "as explained above , in order to have an appropriate connes - kreimer combinatorial hopf algebraic structure ( which , in commutative and noncommutative theories on moyal space - underlies renormalizability ) one needs to find a way of inserting primitively divergent feynman graphs into primitively divergent feynman graphs such that the resulting graph is also primitively divergent .",
    "it is thus interesting to generalize this for the tensor feynman graphs of this type of model .",
    "note that this is highly non - trivial because of the complexity of the topological properties of this type of graphs .",
    "one needs to explicitly consider all pairings between the external edges of the graph to be inserted and the edges at the insertion place . for each such possibility ,",
    "one then has to investigate if the resulting graph remains of type @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , when performing this type of analysis one has to consider the symmetries of the vertex ( for example , in the case of the ribbon graphs of noncommutative field theories on moyal space , one has a cyclical symmetry at the vertex level , as explained in the previous section ) .",
    "these symmetries are responsible for identifying a priori distinct gluing data .",
    "one further property that one can prove using this method , is that the type 1 feynman graphs are the only feynman graphs which can be inserted in such a manner .",
    "finally , let us also stress on the fact that different topological and analytical insights on this type of formulation of quantum gravity models have been investigated in the recent literature ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us also recall that , in a different type of quantum gravity formulation ( the spin - foam one , see for example @xcite ) , this type of algebraic combinatorial study has already been performed @xcite .",
