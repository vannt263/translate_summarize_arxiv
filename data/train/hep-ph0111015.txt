    "at heavy ion collision energies at rhic and lhc , the initial number of heavy quark pairs produced in each collision will be qualitatively different than the number produced at sps energies .",
    "for example , the number of charm quark pairs is expected to be of the order of ten at rhic and several hundred at lhc in the most central collisions @xcite .",
    "let us attempt to extract features of @xmath1 formation from the initially - produced charm quarks which are independent of detailed dynamics .",
    "we consider scenarios in which the formation of @xmath1 is allowed to proceed through any combination of one of the @xmath2 charm quarks with one of the @xmath3 anticharm quarks which result from the initial production of @xmath0 pairs in a central heavy ion collision . for a given charm quark ,",
    "one expects then that the probability @xmath4 to form a @xmath1 is just proportional to the number of available anticharm quarks relative to the number of light antiquarks , @xmath5 where we normalize the number of light antiquarks by the number of produced charged hadrons .",
    "since this ratio is generally very small , one can simply multiply by the number of available charm quarks @xmath2 to obtain the total number of @xmath1 expected in a given event .",
    "@xmath6    where the use of the initial values @xmath7 is again justified by the relatively small number of bound states formed .",
    "for an ensemble of events , the average number of @xmath1 per event is calculated from the average value of initial charm @xmath8 , and we neglect fluctuations in @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 where we place all dynamical dependence in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "[ one can extend this formula to the case where @xmath1 formation is effective not over the entire rapidity range @xmath12 , but only if the quark and antiquark are within the same rapidity interval @xmath13 . in this case one",
    "makes the replacement @xmath14 . ]",
    "the essential property of this result is that the growth with energy of the quadratic dependence on total charm @xcite is expected to be much stronger than the corresponding growth of total particle production in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 production without this quadratic mechanism is typically some small energy - independent fraction of total initial charm production @xcite , so that we can expect the quadratic formation to become dominant at high energy .",
    "we show numerical results in table 1 for these quantities with a prefactor @xmath11 of unity .",
    "estimates for the charm and particle numbers are very approximate , but serve to show the anticipated trend with energy . at sps , this formation mechanism is most probably insignificant . at rhic",
    "it is comparable with  normal \" formation , while at lhc one might expect it to be dominant .",
    "of course , the exact result will depend on the details of the physics which controls the formation .",
    ".comparison of @xmath1 formation variation with energy [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      +",
    "this model is motivated by the success of attempts to explain the relative abundances of light hadrons produced in high energy interactions in terms of the predictions of a hadron gas in chemical and thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "such fits , however , are not able to describe the abundances of hadrons containing charm quarks . this can be understood in terms of the long time scales required to approach chemical equilibrium for heavy quarks .",
    "however , it is expected that for high energy heavy ion collisions the initial production of charm quark pairs exceeds the number expected at chemical equilibrium as determined by the light hadron abundances .",
    "the statistical hadronization model @xcite assumes that at hadronization these charm quarks are distributed into hadrons according to chemical equilibrium , but adjusted by a factor @xmath15 which accounts for oversaturation of charm .",
    "one power of this factor multiplies a given thermal hadron population for each charm or anticharm quark contained in the hadron .",
    "thus the relative abundance of @xmath1 to that of d mesons , for example , will be enhanced in this model .",
    "the enhancement factor is determined by conservation of charm , again using the time scale argument to justify neglecting pair production or annihilation before hadronization .",
    "@xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are calculated in the thermal equilibrium model grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the ratio of bessel functions is an approximate correction factor @xcite which converts to canonical ensemble particle numbers .",
    "this factor will only be significant for non - central collisions or lower energies in which the absolute number of charm pairs is quite small @xcite .",
    "we show in figure [ gammac ] calculated @xmath15 values . at large total charm",
    "there is linear behavior , which leads to the quadratic growth of @xmath1 formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the canonical suppression effect can be very well approximated by using a grand canonical formalism , supplemented by the averaging process for @xmath19 over a distribution of events .",
    "figure [ rhicjpsistat ] shows several applications for rhic conditions .",
    "the centrality dependence is modeled by the number of nucleon participants , and one sees the change in shape due to the transition between canonical and grand canonical formalism .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of @xmath20/charm are comparable with the initial production estimates of a fraction of a percent , indicating that this process may overwhelm suppression for central collisions at rhic .",
    "in this model , we investigate the possibility to form @xmath1 directly in a deconfined medium .",
    "the formation will take advantage of the mobility of initially - produced charm quarks in a spatial region of deconfinement , such that all combinations of a charm plus anticharm are allowed to form a bound state .",
    "for the purposes of this study , we consider a physical picture of deconfinement in which quarkonium is suppressed via collisions with free gluons @xcite .",
    "the dominant formation process , in which a quark and an antiquark in a relative color octet state are captured into a color singlet bound quarkonium state and emit a color octet gluon , is simply the inverse of the breakup reaction .",
    "it is then an inevitable consequence of this picture of suppression that the corresponding formation process must also take place .",

    "the reactivity @xmath11 is the reaction rate @xmath23 averaged over the momentum distribution of the initial participants , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath1 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the gluon density is determined by the equilibrium value in the qgp at each temperature .",
    "the system undergoes a longitudinal isentropic expansion , which fixes the time - dependence of the volume v(@xmath29 ) .",
    "it is evident that the solution of equation [ eqkin ] grows quadratically with initial charm @xmath0 , as long as the total @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31^{-1}\\ , d\\tau } ] , \\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the hadronization time determined by the initial temperature ( @xmath33 is a variable parameter ) and final temperature ( @xmath34 = 150 mev ends the deconfining phase ) .",
    "the function @xmath35 would be the suppression factor in this scenario if the formation mechanism were neglected .",
    "the momentum distribution of the charm quarks is allowed to vary over a wide range of possibilities .",
    "at one extreme we use a thermal equilibrium distribution at the qgp temperature .",
    "we also consider a distribution unchanged from that introduced in the initial perturbative qcd processes , plus several intermediate distributions with decreasing rapidity widths .",
    "the centrality dependence can also be modeled , using nuclear collision geometry to set the various spatial scales . for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we show the resulting ratios @xmath36/@xmath0 in figure [ rhicjpsiall ] ( for rhic ) and figure [ lhcjpsiall ] ( for lhc ) for a full range of the initial charm quark rapidity distributions . shown for comparison are some statistical hadronization model results , plus an indication of the value if only initial ( vacuum ) production were present .",
    "it is evident that although the absolute values depend strongly on the charm momentum distribution , the magnitudes are substantially above that expected if only initial production plus plasma suppression were present .",
    "the centrality dependence is quite striking . even after normalizing to initial charm",
    ", the ratio rises with increasing centrality .",
    "expectations based on general grounds for enhanced formation of heavy quarkonium in relativistic heavy ion collisions have been verified in two different models . in particular , one expects at rhic and lhc to see an enhancement in the heavy quarkonium formation rate , even when compared to unsuppressed production via elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions in vacuum . the magnitude of this effect is expected to grow with the centrality of the heavy ion collision , just opposite to the predictions of various suppression scenarios .",
    "the physics bases for these models , however , are quite distinct .",
    "their differences should manifest themselves in details of the magnitudes and centrality dependence . in this regard ,",
    "it is essential to have a simultaneous measurement of open flavor production to serve as an unambiguous baseline .    9 p. l. mcgaughey , e. quack , p. v. ruuskanen , r. vogt , and x .-",
