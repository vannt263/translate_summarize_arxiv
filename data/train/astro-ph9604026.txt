    "quite a few nearby galaxies seem to have compact radio cores in their nuclei , prominent cases are the milky way ( sgr a * ) , m31 and m81 .",
    "those radio cores resemble the cores of radio loud quasars , showing a very high brightness temperature and a flat to inverted radio spectrum that extends up to submm wavelengths .",
    "several models have been developed to explain those cores in the context of black hole accretion : melia ( 1992a&b ) suggested a spherical accretion model for sgr a * and , what he called , m31*. falcke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and falcke , mannheim , & biermann ( 1993 , hereinafter fmb93 ) proposed an alternative model , where sgr a * was explained as the core of a radio jet , fed by an underluminous , starving accretion disk ( see also falcke 1996a , for a review , and falcke & heinrich 1994 for m31 * ) .",
    "this model evolved into the jet - disk symbiosis approach ( falcke & biermann 1995 , hereinafter fb95 ; falcke 1996b ) that unified the explanation for radio cores of quasars ( falcke , malkan , & biermann 1995 , hereinafter fmb95 ) , galactic jet sources ( falcke & biermann 1996 ) and sgr a * into a single picture .",
    "the basic idea was to postulate that black holes , jets and disks form closely coupled systems with little variations from one system to another except for the accretion rate .",
    "recent vlbi ( bietenholz et al . 1996 ) , multiwavelengths ( ho , filipenko & sargent 1996 ) and submm observations ( reuter & duschl 1996 ) have now shown that the radio core in m81  which in analogy to sgr a * and m31 * , we will label m81 * hereafter  is very similar to sgr a*. this wealth of data now makes m81 * an excellent laboratory to test the jet - disk symbiosis in detail .",
    "one of the interesting findings of the vlbi observations ( de bruyn et al . 1976 ; bartel et al .",
    "1982 ; bietenholz et al .",
    "1996 ) is that the radio core of m81 * is elongated and its size is intrinsically frequency dependent with @xmath0 .",
    "a frequency dependent size was one of the basic predictions of the jet model and excludes any homogenous , optically thin models ( e.g. as in duschl & lesch 1994 ) .",
    "however , the measured size - frequency relation is slightly shallower than in the blandford & knigl ( 1979 , hereinafter bk79 ) free jet model adopted by fb95 , and the radio spectrum of sgr a * and m81 * are both slightly inverted rather than flat as in the simple model . here",
    "we show , that a self - consistent treatment of the bk79 model implies a weak acceleration of the bulk jet flow due to its longitudinal pressure gradient which can naturally explain the observed size- and spectral indices in compact radio cores .      as in fb95",
    ", we shall describe the jet core within the framework of relativistic gasdynamics of a relativistic gas with adiabatic index @xmath1 .",
    "we consider only the supersonic regime and impose as boundary condition , that the jet expands freely with its initial soundspeed @xmath2 without any lateral gradients behind the jet nozzle .",
    "this leads to the familiar conical jet with @xmath3 ( bk79 ) , where adiabatic losses due to lateral expansion need not be considered . for a confined jet scenario ( e.g. sanders 1983 ) at larger scales the adiabatic losses could",
    ", however , be quite severe with energy densities scaling as @xmath4 .",
    "nonetheless , even in a simple , free jet at least some work due to expansion will be done , because there is always a longitudinal pressure gradient , which will accelerate the jet along its axis .",
    "this acceleration is described by the z - component of the modified , relativistic euler equation ( e.g. pomraning 1973 , eq .",
    "9.171 ) in cylindrical coordinates where we set @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 here , @xmath8 ist the enthalpy density of the jet , @xmath9 is the internal energy density , @xmath10 is the particle density , and @xmath11 is the pressure in the jet ( all in the local rest frame ) . for",
    "the ` maximal jets '  the radiatively most efficient type of jet ( fb95 )  to be discussed here , we demand the equivalence of internal energy and kinetic ( or better rest mass ) energy @xmath12 , hence @xmath13 and @xmath14const at the sonic point @xmath15 . in the free jet with conical shape",
    "the energy density evolves as @xmath16 and we do not consider any loss mechanisms other than adiabatic losses due to the longitudinal expansion . using the relations mentioned above , the euler equation becomes    @xmath17    with @xmath18 . for @xmath19 this is analogous to the euler equation for the well known isothermal , pressure driven winds , with the wind speed replaced by the proper jet speed and the sound speed is constant and fixed by the required equivalence between internal and rest mass energy density at a value @xmath20 .    the asymptotic solution of eq .",
    "[ euler2 ] for @xmath21const and @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "if we ignore terms of the order @xmath24 we could approximate the solution by @xmath25 .",
    "for the following calculations we will , however , use the exact , numerical solution to eq .  [ euler2 ] ( @xmath26const ) , but the deviation from the approximate , asymptotic solution is rather small .",
    "the basic ideas how to derive the synchrotron emissivity and basic properties of a jet in a coupled jet - disk system have been described extensively in fmb93 and fb95 .",
    "the power @xmath27 of _ one _ jet cone is a fixed fraction of the disk luminosity , relativistic particles and magnetic field @xmath28 are in equipartition within a factor @xmath29  which we hereafter set to one , and the energy fluxes are conserved along the conical jet ( for a moment we will forget the adiabatic losses ) .",
    "mass conservation requires that the mass loss in the jet @xmath30 is smaller than the mass accretion rate in the disk @xmath31 , thus @xmath32 , while mass and energy of the jet are coupled by the relativistic bernoulli equation @xmath33 ( fmb93 ) .    here",
    "we will make use of the same logic and notation but with three changes with respect to fb95 , namely ( 1 ) applying the velocity law eq .",
    "[ v ] , ( 2 ) neglecting the energy contents in turbulence and ( 3 ) considering only a quasi monoenergetic energy distribution for the electrons at a lorentz factor @xmath34 ( usually @xmath35 ) .",
    "the latter is indicated by the steep submm - ir cut - off of sgr a * ( zylka et al .",
    "1995 )  and probably also m81 * ( reuter & lesch 1996 )  which is different from typical blazar spectra and precludes an initial electron powerlaw distribution ( as in fmb93 ) .",
    "the semi - opening angle of the jet is @xmath36 , and the magnetic field in the comoving frame of a maximal jet with the given sound speed , @xmath37 erg / sec , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 cm becomes ( see eq .  19 in fb95 ) @xmath40    the number of relativistic electrons that are to be in equipartition with the magnetic field are a fraction @xmath41 of the total particle number density , and the energy density ratio between relativistic protons and electrons is @xmath42 . from the energy equation @xmath43 we find that the characteristic lorentz factor and electron density required to achieve equipartition are @xmath44 finally , to incorporate adiabatic losses we now have to make the following transitions with respect to the equations in fb94 @xmath45      the local spectrum of the jet will be @xmath46 between the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath47 and the characteristic frequency @xmath48 = @xmath49 ( here we will use an average pitch angle @xmath50 ) . for the maximal jet using equations [ b ] , [ gamma ] , [ n ] and [ adloss ] , we have in the observers frame @xmath51 with the doppler factor @xmath52 for an inclination @xmath53 of the jet axis to the line of sight .    to find the local synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath54 we have to solve the equation @xmath55 and transform into the observers frame .",
    "the jet radius is @xmath56 and the synchrotron self - absorption cross section for a monoenergetic electron distribution is given by @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 , yielding    @xmath60    if we now use the velocity profile eq .",
    "[ v ] we can invert eq .  [ nuc ] to find the size of the jet as a function of observed frequency .",
    "for the asymptotic regime @xmath61 , @xmath62 is approximated for a fixed inclination angle to within a few per - cent by a powerlaw in @xmath63 , such that    @xmath64    where the parameters are @xmath65  au , @xmath66  ghz , @xmath67 and @xmath68 au for @xmath69 .",
    "the total spectrum of the jet is obtained by integrating the synchrotron emissivity @xmath70 along the jet : @xmath71 , which can again be approximated using powerlaws :    @xmath72    for @xmath73 mpc , and @xmath74 ) respectively .",
    "this means that the resulting spectrum is no longer flat but tends to be inverted with @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the spectral index , like the size index , is a function of the inclination angle of the jet and tends to become flatter for smaller @xmath53 .",
    "we can now apply this formalism to the situation in m81 * , where we have five observed quantities , namely the time averaged spectral index @xmath77 ( reuter & lesch 1996 ) , the flux @xmath78 mjy , the size @xmath79 au , the frequency dependence of the size @xmath80 with @xmath81 ( bietenholz et al . 1996 ) , and the bolometric luminosity of the nuclear source ( ho , filipenko , & sargent 1996 ) which is @xmath82 erg / sec .    most of the model parameters are already well constrained . as the cosmic - ray ratio @xmath83 and the fractional number of electrons",
    "@xmath84 are almost interchangeable we keep the latter fixed at @xmath85 .",
    "the jet - disk ratio @xmath86 was determined in fmb95 to be @xmath87 for a flat spectrum . to bring this model with an inverted spectrum and a peak at submm wavelengths to the same fluxscale one",
    "has to increase this value to @xmath88 where disk luminosity and jet have equal powers ; here we do not intent to change this value .",
    "the size of the nozzle @xmath89 enters only weakly into the equations ; if we assume that the high - frequency cut - off which is somewhere around 1000 ghz correspond to the size scale of the nozzle ( in analogy to sgr a * in falcke 1996 ) we find by extrapolation that @xmath90 au as an order of magnitude estimate . for a nozzle size of 10 - 100 gravitational radii",
    "this correponds to black hole masses of @xmath91 which is consistent with dynamical estimates ( ho et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "this leaves us with two main input parameters : @xmath53 and @xmath92 .",
    "the cosmic - ray ratio determines the electron lorentz factor and is well constrained ; by definition @xmath93 and from the condition @xmath94 we here have @xmath95 ( eqs .",
    "[ nuc]&[nus ] ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the predicted sizes and fluxes of the model for various @xmath92 and @xmath53 , indicating that in m81 * @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( fmb95 used @xmath98 for quasars ) .",
    "the predicted spectral index then is @xmath99 and the predicted size index is @xmath100 . considering the simplicity of the model , those values are reasonably close to the observed ones .",
    "the jet - disk symbiosis emission model by fmb93 and fb95 which was initially developed to explain the radio core of sgr a * and radio loud quasars can also explain the nuclear radio source in m81 in detail . simply by scaling the accretion disk luminosity by several powers of ten to the observed value properly predicts flux , size , spectral index , and size index of the vlbi radio source .    if one inserts m81 * into the universal @xmath101radio correlation presented in falcke & biermann ( 1996 ) it falls right onto the line that connects sgr a * and radio loud quasars .",
    "this suggests that all these sources are powered by a very similar ( jet / disk ) engine . in this context",
    "it is quite interesting to note that m81 * and sgr a * are in spiral galaxies , yet appear radio loud in these diagrams .",
    "m81 also has recently shown double - peaked broad emission lines , a feature usually seen only in radio - loud galaxies ( bower et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "like in quasars and sgr a * , one has to choose the most efficient , equipartition jet model to explain m81 * , with high internal energy and a jet power that equals the disk luminosity .",
    "this leaves one with no free parameters for m81 * other than the jet inclination angle which according to the current model is around @xmath102 .",
    "some caution is , however , neccessary , as the pa of the vlbi component seems to change with frequency , something we have ignored here .",
    "it is not clear whether this indicates bending , helical motion , or an extrinsic effect and thus is difficult to interpret .",
    "some of these effects could change the results slightly  but not to an order of magnitude .    in this _",
    "letter _ we have considered for the first time the effects of the longitudinal pressure gradient in the bk79 and fb95 jet model . without any sophisticated mechanisms , this gradient alone will already lead to a moderate acceleration of the jet to bulk lorentz factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "consequently , the lorentz factor will increase towards lower frequencies and for a fixed viewing angle outside the boosting cone the flux will become doppler - dimmed with respect to higher frequencies .",
    "this can provide a natural explanation for the inverted spectrum seen in compact radio cores in general and for the size / frequency relation of m81*. such a mildly accelerating jet may also be of interest for quasar and bl lac radio cores or galactic jet sources .",
    "the biggest advantage , however , is that the jet velocity , which was previously a free parameter , now is fixed by a simple physical model .",
    "another interesting point of the presented model is the usage of an initial , quasi monoenergetic electron distribution for which we find @xmath103 .",
    "this not only reduces another free parameter ( the electron distribution index ) but also can explain the submm - ir cut - offs seen in sgr a * and m81*. if the jet in m81 * does not have strong shocks to re - accelerate those electrons into the ususal power - law , the jet would have size - dependent high - frequency cut - offs and thus explain the apparent absence of extended vlbi components in m81*.    this research was supported by nasa under grants nagw-3268 and nag8 - 1027 .",
