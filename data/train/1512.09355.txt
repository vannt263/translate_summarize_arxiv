    "pion decay has provided an important testing ground for the weak interaction and radiative corrections from the beginnings of modern subatomic physics .",
    "the unexpected suppression of the direct electronic decay of the pion ( @xmath7 , or @xmath1 ) led to an early examination of the nature of the weak interaction and to the prediction of a low branching fraction of @xmath8 @xcite as a consequence of the @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  nature of the weak interaction , through helicity suppression of the right - handed state of the electron . in the meantime , the extraordinary success of the standard model has opened significant opportunities for precision tests of its underlying symmetries , lepton and quark - lepton coupling universality , and a host of related issues through precision measurements of pion decays",
    ". we will address the specific motivation and physics reach for each channel separately below .",
    "a recent in - depth review of the subject is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "muon decay , a purely leptonic electroweak process , serves a special role in the standard model because it calibrates the strength of the weak coupling .",
    "its precise theoretical description , via the so - called michel parameters @xcite , positions it uniquely to provide constraints on possible contributions outside the @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  standard electroweak model .",
    "below we discuss new results on the muon radiative decay @xmath12 , the only process that gives access to the decay parameter @xmath13 .",
    "at the tree level , the ratio of the @xmath15 to @xmath16 decay widths is given by @xcite @xmath17 where the ratio of squared lepton masses for the two decays , comes from the helicity suppression by the @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  lepton-@xmath18 boson weak couplings . if , instead , the decay could proceed directly through the pseudoscalar current , the ratio @xmath19 would reduce to the second , phase - space factor , or approximately 5.5 .",
    "more complete treatment of the process includes @xmath20 , the radiative and loop corrections , and the possibility of lepton universality violation , i.e. , that @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the electron and muon couplings to the @xmath18 , respectively , may not be equal : @xmath23 where the `` @xmath24 '' indicates that radiative decays are fully included in the branching fractions .",
    "improvements of the theoretical description of the @xmath1 decay have culminated in a series of calculations that have refined the sm prediction to a precision of 8 parts in @xmath25 : @xmath26 a comparison with equation ( [ eq : pi_e2_tree ] ) reveals that the radiative and loop corrections amount to almost 4% of @xmath27 .",
    "however , the current experimental precision @xcite @xmath28 lags behind the theoretical one by more than an order of magnitude .    because of the large helicity suppression of the @xmath1  decay , its branching ratio is highly susceptible to small non-@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  contributions from new physics , making this decay a particularly suitable subject of study , as discussed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "this prospect provides the primary motivation for the ongoing pen @xcite and pienu @xcite experiments . of the possible `` new physics '' contributions in the lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath1  is directly sensitive to the pseudoscalar one . at the precision of @xmath29",
    ", @xmath19 probes the pseudoscalar and axial vector mass scales up to 1,000tev and 20tev , respectively @xcite .",
    "for comparison , cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix unitarity and precise measurements of several superallowed nuclear beta decays constrain the non - sm vector contributions to @xmath30tev , and scalar to @xmath31tev @xcite . although scalar interactions do not directly contribute to @xmath19 , they can do so through loop diagrams , resulting in sensitivity to new scalar interactions up to 60tev @xcite .",
    "the subject was recently reviewed at length in ref .",
    "in addition , @xmath32 provides limits on masses of certain susy partners @xcite , and on neutrino sector anomalies @xcite .      between 2008 and 2010 , pen , a collaboration of 7 institutions from usa and europe , has carried out measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays at rest at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) with the aim to reach @xmath35 , and is currently analyzing the data @xcite .",
    "the pen experiment uses an upgraded version of the pibeta detector system , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and previously used in a series of rare pion and muon decay measurements @xcite .",
    "the main component of the pen apparatus , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pen_det ] ,        is a spherical large - acceptance ( @xmath36sr ) electromagnetic shower calorimeter .",
    "the calorimeter comprises 240 truncated pyramids of pure csi , 12 radiation lengths ( r.l . ) deep .",
    "beam particles entering the apparatus with @xmath37mev/@xmath38 are tagged in a thin upstream beam counter ( bc ) and , after a @xmath39 m long flight path in a 5 mm thick active degrader ( ad ) and a low - mass mini time projection chamber ( mtpc ) , finally to reach a 15 mm thick active target ( at ) where the beam pions stop .",
    "decay particles are tracked non - magnetically in a pair of concentric cylindrical multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc1,2 ) and an array of twenty 4 mm thick plastic hodoscope detectors ( ph ) , all surrounding the active target .",
    "the bc , ad , at and ph detectors are all made of fast plastic scintillator material .",
    "detector waveforms are digitized at 2gs / s for bc , ad , and at , and at 250ms / s for the mtpc .     and @xmath40 events .",
    "the two processes are distinguished primarily by the total @xmath41 energy and by the absence or presence , respectively , of an extra 4.1mev ( muon ) in the target due to @xmath42 decay .",
    "the @xmath1 data are shown with a pion lifetime @xmath43ns exponential decay function superimposed .",
    "the @xmath40 data , prescaled by a factor of @xmath441/64 , are shown with the cut on the probability of @xmath45% for a second , pile - up muon to be present in the target at @xmath46 .",
    "the turquoise histogram gives the @xmath40 yield constructed entirely from the measured @xmath7 data folded with the @xmath47 decay rate , and corrected for random muons ; it perfectly matches the bold dark blue histogram .",
    "the two lower plots show the observed to predicted ratios for @xmath1  and @xmath40 events , respectively ; the observed scatter is statistical in nature . ]    a key source of systematic uncertainty in @xmath1  measurements at rest has been the hard to measure low energy tail of the detector response function , caused by electromagnetic shower leakage from the calorimeter mostly in the form of photons , masked by the overwhelming @xmath48 background events .",
    "other physical processes , if not properly identified and suppressed , also contribute events , mainly to the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "they include : ordinary pion decay into a muon in flight , before the pion is stopped , with the resulting muon decaying within the time gate accepted in the measurement , and radiative decay events . the latter process is well measured , analyzed , and properly accounted for in the pen apparatus .",
    "shower leakage and pion decays in flight can only be well characterized if the @xmath40 chain can be well separated from the direct @xmath49 decay in the target .",
    "therefore much effort has been devoted to digitization , filtering and analysis of the target waveforms @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf_fits ] .",
    "the decay time histograms of the @xmath7 decay and @xmath50 sequence , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pen - decaytime ] for a subset of data recorded in 2010 , illustrate best the quality of the pen data .",
    "the @xmath7 data follow the exponential decay law over more than three orders of magnitude , and perfectly predict the measured @xmath40 sequential decay data once the latter are corrected for random ( pile - up ) events .",
    "both event ensembles were obtained with minimal requirements ( cuts ) on detector observables , none of which bias the selection in ways that would affect the branching ratio .",
    "the probability of random @xmath51 events originating in the target can be controlled in the data sample by making use of multihit time to digital converter ( tdc ) data that record early pion stop signals . with this information",
    "one can strongly suppress events in which an `` old '' muon was present in the target by the time of the pion stop that triggered the readout .    during the 2008 - 10",
    "production runs the pen experiment accumulated some @xmath52 @xmath7 , and more than @xmath53 @xmath40 events , as well as significant numbers of pion and muon radiative decays .",
    "a comprehensive blinded maximum likelihood analysis is under way to extract a new experimental value of @xmath27 . as of this writing , there appear no obstacles that would prevent the pen collaboration to reach a precision of @xmath54 .",
    "the pienu experiment at triumf , discussed below , has a similar precision goal .",
    "the pienu experiment at triumf builds on the earlier measurements at the same laboratory @xcite , aiming at a significant improvement in precision through refinements of the technique used .",
    "major improvements in precision in pienu over the earlier triumf tina measurement derive from improved geometry and beamline , a superior calorimeter , as well as high - speed digitizing of all detector signals .",
    "the apparatus is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pienu_det ] .",
    "a 75mev/@xmath38 @xmath33 beam from the improved triumf m13 beam line @xcite is tracked in wire chambers , identified by plastic scintillators , and stopped in a 0.8 cm thick scintillator target .",
    "fine tracking near the target is provided by two sets of single - sided silicon strip detectors located immediately upstream and downstream of the target assembly .",
    "the positrons from @xmath7 and @xmath40 decays are detected in the positron telescope , which consists of a silicon strip counter , two thin plastic counters , and an acceptance - defining wire chamber that covers the front of the crystal calorimeter .",
    "the calorimeter is 19 r.l .",
    "deep and consists of a large single crystal of nai(tl ) surrounded laterally by an array of 97 pure csi crystals .",
    "the solid - angle acceptance of the telescope counters is 20% of 4@xmath55sr .",
    "thus , pienu achieves better energy resolution than pen , at the expense of lower solid angle coverage .",
    "the pienu experiment completed data acquisition in 2012 , and is in the analysis stage as of this writing .",
    "the pienu collaboration has recently published an analysis of 1/5 of their data @xcite with the result @xmath56 which is consistent with the previous world average @xcite as well as with the standard model prediction of eq .",
    "[ eq : pi_e2_full_sm ] , and has the effect of reducing the previous world average uncertainty by almost a factor of two , as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : pi_e2_2015_avg ] .",
    "the decay @xmath2 proceeds via a combination of qed ( inner bremsstrahlung , @xmath58 ) and direct , structure - dependent ( @xmath59 ) amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the strong helicity suppression of the primary non - radiative process , @xmath7 , discussed above , also suppresses the @xmath58 terms , making the structure - dependent amplitudes measurable in certain regions of phase space @xcite . to describe the @xmath59 amplitude , standard @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  electroweak theory requires only two pion form factors , @xmath60 , axial vector , and @xmath61 , vector ( or polar - vector ) .",
    "for the minimum value @xmath62 ( red dot ) plus 1 , 2 , and 4 units , respectively , in the @xmath60-@xmath61 parameter plane .",
    "the range of the cvc prediction @xmath63 is indicated by the dashed vertical lines .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details . ]",
    "the amplitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 in principle depend on the 4-momentum transfer @xmath64 to the @xmath65-@xmath66 pair ( or to the @xmath18 boson ) ; in @xmath3  decay @xmath67 is a good approximation ( `` soft pion limit '' ) . for a long time",
    "radiative pion decay measurements had access only to one structure dependent amplitude , the @xmath68 , with weak or no sensitivity to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore most evaluations took the value of @xmath61 from the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis prediction based on the @xmath70 decay width @xcite .",
    "recent pibeta collaboration results @xcite led to an order of magnitude improvement in the precision of the @xmath3  branching ratio determination , as well as of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and a first evaluation of the @xmath64 dependence of @xmath61 .",
    "however , the measurement was most sensitive to the low @xmath71 segment of phase space which is strongly dominated by the @xmath72 amplitude , resulting in a very narrow constraint on @xmath73 , as shown in fig .  [ fig : f_a - f_v-2013 ] .",
    "the pen data analysis is expected to add significantly to the more than 60k pibeta @xmath3  event set , but with increased sensitivity to the @xmath74 amplitude due to better controlled backgrounds .",
    "thus , the extremely skewed ellipse of fig .",
    "[ fig : f_a - f_v-2013 ] would give way to a more balanced set of limits , and , thus , an improved independent limit on @xmath61 , as well as a further tightening of the limit on @xmath75 , the long hinted - at tensor contribution @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the ratio of @xmath76 enters directly into the chiral perturbation theory lagrangian at the leading order through the @xmath77 term @xcite , and is among the basic low energy chiral constants .",
    "unlike @xmath1 , the extremely rare , @xmath79 , pion beta decay is not suppressed ; its low rate derives from the restricted phase space of final states , entirely due to the small difference between the @xmath80 and @xmath81 masses . as a pure vector",
    "@xmath82 transition , it is fully analogous to the superallowed fermi ( saf ) nuclear beta decays ; indeed it is the simplest realization of the latter , fully free of complications arising from nuclear structure corrections .",
    "saf decays have historically led to the formulation of the cvc hypothesis , and have played a critical role in testing the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix through evaluations of the @xmath83 element @xcite .",
    "the @xmath440.5% pibeta @xmath5  measurement @xcite is the most precise one to date . because it used @xmath1  decay events for normalization",
    ", this result will receive a slight improvement in precision once the pen and pienu results become available . although not competitive with the saf based @xmath83 , there are no plans to improve the pibeta result precision until the current crop of experiments studying the more easily accessible neutron beta decay are completed ( for a more detailed discussion of that topic see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the meantime , however , one can use the pibeta @xmath5 branching ratio to evaluate @xmath19 by fixing @xmath83 to its very precise pdg 2014 recommended value of @xmath84 @xcite and adjusting @xmath19 until the extracted value of @xmath85 agrees .",
    "this exercise yields : @xmath86 in good agreement with direct measurements reviewed in the above section on @xmath1  decay .",
    "a 2004 pibeta set of @xmath440.5 m radiative muon events was recently analyzed ; the relevant measured and monte carlo simulated spectra , including backgrounds , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmd ] , are in excellent    agreement within the design acceptance of the spectrometer .",
    "the analysis yields a preliminary branching ratio for @xmath88mev , and @xmath89 : @xmath90 which represents a 29-fold improvement in precision over the previous result @xcite , and is in excellent agreement with the sm value : @xmath91 .",
    "minimum-@xmath92 analysis of the most sensitive data subset ( with roughly balanced systematic and statistical uncertainties ) yields a preliminary value for the @xmath13 parameter ( @xmath93 ) : @xmath94 a 4-fold improvement over previous limits @xcite .",
    "details of this analysis , including a discussion of the uncertainties , are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "vigorous efforts are presently under way to measure precisely the branching ratios for allowed rare decays of the charged pion as well as of the muon .",
    "the experimental precision still lags by about an order of magnitude behind sm calculations . as that gap is narrowed , this field of research , complementary to collider searches , will realize its full potential for discovery or further improvement of the limits on various possible extensions of the standard model beyond the well established @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  form . specifically , a significant improvement of the precision of the @xmath1  branching ratio is expected from the full pen and pienu analyses which are forthcoming in the near future , with attendant limits on lepton universality and non-(@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 ) interaction terms ."
