    "in the standard model of low - mass star formation , dense cores are the precursors of star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , to understand the process of star formation , one needs to observe the physical conditions of these cores .",
    "embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) are sometimes detected in these cores .",
    "these ysos are partially obscured by the dust within the cores . to accurately model their physical properties",
    "requires knowledge of the quantity of dust and its composition , since both affect the degree of attenuation , or extinction , of starlight . by studying the dust",
    ", one can learn about its chemistry and evolution .",
    "furthermore , the dust provides a direct measure of the column density and mass .",
    "molecular tracers can suffer depletion in dense regions , making mass estimates from them unreliable .",
    "in this paper we use _ spitzer _ and deep ground - based @xmath9 observations to probe the dust properties within four cores : l204c-2 , l1152 , l1155c-2 , and l1228 .",
    "two of our cores , l1152 and l1228 , have known protostars while the other two do not .",
    "our first goal in this paper is to examine the yso population of these cores and to look for faint previously unknown protostars in all four cores .",
    "second , we will compute the extinction law in each core and compare it to the predictions of three dust models to draw conclusions about the dust properties within the cores .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  [ sec : observe ] describes our observations and data processing pipeline including source classification , the removal of misidentified background galaxies , and how we computed line - of - sight ( los ) extinctions to each star . in  [ sec : core - ext ] we use these los extinctions to create extinction maps for each core .",
    "[ sec : coreysos ] explores the yso content in our cores . in  [ sec : dust ] we compute the relative extinction as a function of wavelength , the extinction law , for each core .",
    "we also create maps of the @xmath4 maps of the difference between the observed and predicted extinction laws and compare to the extinction maps .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "table [ tab : corebasic ] lists the location and our assumed distance to each of our cores : l204c-2 , l1152 , l1155c-2 , and l1228 .",
    "these cores were all observed as part of the _ spitzer _ legacy science program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) @xcite . using _ spitzer _ , we re - observed these cores with @xmath10 the integration time as c2d to look for faint protostars in the cores .",
    "these observations were part of go program # 3656 .",
    "we observed each core in two epochs , where the second epoch was separated from the first by as little as one day but could be up to almost a month later .",
    "l204c-2 is located at an ecliptic latitude where asteroids may be a problem ; the separation of the two observing epochs ensures we can identify these sources .",
    "irac ( @xmath11 m ) and mips1 ( @xmath6 m ) were observed separately , resulting in four _ spitzer _ astronomical observation requests ( aors ) per core .",
    "our _ spitzer _ aors are listed in table [ tab : coreobs ] .    to complement our _ spitzer _ data",
    ", we obtained deep @xmath9 data using the florida multi - object imaging near - ir grism observational spectrometer ( flamingos ) @xcite instrument installed on the 4-meter telescope at kitt peak .",

    "the flamingos field - of - view is @xmath12 .",
    "each field consisted of multiple dithers with small offsets around a central position .",
    "the total integration time per pixel was 12 minutes ( @xmath13 ) , 6 minutes ( @xmath14 ) , and 3 minutes ( @xmath15 ) . for two fields each in l1152 and l1155c-2 ( centered on the core ) we took even deeper observations with total integration times of @xmath16 hour ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath16 hour ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath17 minutes ( @xmath15 ) . except for a small corner in l204c-2",

    "spitzer_. in figures [ fig : rgb - l204c-2]-[fig : rgb - l1228 ] we show three - color images of each core and also selected subregions .",
    "we reduced our @xmath9 data using python and pyraf .",
    "each flamingos field consisted of multiple dithers with small offsets around a central position . to create our science images , we first subtracted a median filtered dark image from each dither .",
    "second , the dithers were flat - fielded by dividing out a dome flat .",
    "next , we subtracted off the sky .",
    "this is critical for ir observations where the sky is typically much brighter than the astronomical objects of interest .",
    "we used a two - pass sky subtraction with a running median : stars were identified from the first pass , then masked out in the second pass to produce an improved sky subtraction .",
    "finally , we averaged together the individual dithers for each field .",
    "we used the 2mass catalog to correct the coordinates in each field and also to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the stars in each field were found using the iraf task ` daofind ` and we used ` daophot ` to compute their point spread function ( psf ) photometry .",
    "we visually inspected the results to remove false sources identified by ` daofind ` and also to add sources missed by the source extractor .",
    "finally , we bandmerged the individual @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 detections into a single @xmath9 catalog for each core .",
    "our _ spitzer _ data were processed through the standard c2d pipeline . for a full description of this pipeline",
    ", please refer to the c2d data delivery documentation available on the spitzer science center s ( ssc ) website .",
    "we will summarize the pipeline here .",
    "we started with the basic calibrated datasets ( bcds ) processed by the ssc using their s13 pipeline .",
    "we then corrected several image artifacts caused by bright sources and cosmic rays and also some instrumental effects .",
    "lastly , we applied location - dependent photometric corrections that account for variations in the detector response across the array .    after improving the bcds we combined them into mosaics for each core using the ssc s software mopex @xcite .",
    "we then extracted sources using a modified version of dophot @xcite .",
    "dophot fits psfs and as sources are found they are subtracted from the images .",
    "next , we bandmerged the individual detections from the @xmath5 to @xmath6 m wavebands and attempted to determine upper limits for non - detections .",
    "since we did not obtain any short integration `` high dynamic range '' ( hdr ) observations , we used the c2d observations that _ do _ contain hdr frames to correct for saturated fluxes .",
    "we compared our fluxes with the c2d fluxes in each irac band and empirically determined a flux limit at which our values systematically diverged from c2d s .",
    "we then substituted the c2d fluxes for any sources with a c2d flux brighter than this limit .",
    "these limits were : 35 , 35 , 300 , and 150 mjy for the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and @xmath18 m bands , respectively .",
    "finally , we combined our @xmath5 to @xmath6 m and deep @xmath9 catalogs to create bandmerged catalogs from @xmath19 to @xmath6 m for each of the four cores .",
    "the mean difference in position between sources in our @xmath9 catalogs and in the 2mass catalogs is @xmath20 , and 95% of our sources have a difference in position of @xmath21 ( around 2 pixels on the flamingos ccd ) .",
    "we also computed the flux difference between our kitt peak observations and the 2mass catalog .",
    "the resultant distributions are gaussian with mean @xmath22 mjy and @xmath23% in all three of the @xmath9 bands .",
    "even though our _ spitzer _ data are not part of the c2d program , we processed them through the c2d pipeline so we expect the errors in the _ spitzer _ wavebands will be similar to c2d s .",
    "the c2d delivery documentation discusses three sources of uncertainty : statistical , systematic , and absolute .",
    "the first two of these are incorporated into the photometric uncertainties listed in the c2d catalog .",
    "these errors are derived from the repeatability of flux measurements using the c2d pipeline .",
    "the c2d documentation lists a @xmath24 systematic error for irac and @xmath25 for mips . combining the systematic and statistical errors , our final photometric uncertainties are approximately @xmath26 in irac and @xmath27 in mips .",
    "the absolute uncertainties in the flux calibration are 1.5% and 4% , respectively , for the irac and mips1 ( @xmath6 m ) bands .",
    "we obtained these values from the infrared array camera ( irac ) data handbook , version 3.0 and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) data handbook , version 3.3.0 .",
    "the absolute uncertainties are added in quadrature with the photometric errors during source classification , but are not used elsewhere since they are smaller than the photometric errors .",
    "table [ tab : limits ] lists our @xmath28 and @xmath29 limits for each wavelength .",
    "our @xmath28 @xmath9 limits are @xmath30 magnitudes deeper than the 2mass limits of 15.8 , 15.1 , and 14.3 magnitudes , respectively . in the dense core regions of l1152 and l1155c-2 we were able to take even deeper @xmath9 observations .",
    "these limits are listed in parentheses in the table . as for the _ spitzer _ wavebands , our @xmath28 limits are 1.5 - 2 magnitudes fainter in the irac bands and 2.5 magnitudes fainter in the mips1 band compared to c2d .",
    "we used a modified version of the c2d data pipeline to classify sources based on their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from @xmath19 to @xmath6 m .",
    "the standard c2d pipeline uses all available wavelengths to compute the extinction towards each star :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the stellar photosphere model , @xmath33 is the scaling factor of the model for a particular star , and is the ratio of the extinction at wavelength @xmath34 to visual extinction from the dust extinction law . @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath35 can be derived from the linear @xmath4 fit of this equation by adopting stellar photosphere and dust extinction models .",
    "the stellar models used are based on the kurucz - lejeune models and come from the ssc s online `` star - pet '' tool .",
    "for the 2mass bands , the observed @xmath36 and @xmath37 colors of stars @xcite were translated to fluxes relative to @xmath38 band and the difference between the @xmath38 and @xmath15 bands was ignored .",
    "sources fit by equation [ eq : fit ] with a goodness - of - fit @xmath39 were classified as reddened stars , while those that did not fit were compared with other templates to classify them .",
    "the goodness - of - fit , @xmath40 , is the incomplete gamma function and gives the probability that the statistical @xmath4 distribution would exceed our observed @xmath4 ( computed from eq.[eq : fit ] ) by chance .",
    "thus , a very small @xmath40 means it is unlikely that the differences between our data and a given @xmath41 are due to chance , i.e.the model is unlikely to be an accurate fit to the data @xcite .",
    "our minimum @xmath40 value of 0.1 is the same one used by the c2d team for identifying stars .",
    "we slightly modified this procedure for this paper .",
    "first , the extinction is computed for each source using the @xmath9 bands and the nicer technique @xcite .",
    "the nicer technique relies on the assumption of intrinsic values for the @xmath36 and @xmath42 colors of stars . for this paper",
    "we adopted the values @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these values were derived from the average stellar model computed in appendix [ sec : avgmodel ] .",
    "then , using equation [ eq : fit ] , we identified the stars with the extinction held fixed .",
    "we also computed extinctions in @xmath45 rather than the more traditional @xmath35 so we can directly compare our results with those of other authors .",
    "we made this change because one of our goals in this paper is to compute the extinction law at the irac and mips wavelengths .",
    "the method we use for deriving the mid - infrared extinction law ( @xmath46 ) is dependent on @xmath45 so we can not use these wavelengths when computing @xmath45 .",
    "however , we still need to choose an appropriate extinction law .",
    "this will be used to compute @xmath45 from the @xmath9 bands and also for the source classification .",
    "we considered two dust models , the @xcite @xmath47 and @xmath48 models . the @xmath47 model ( hereafter wd3.1 )",
    "is designed to reproduce the extinction law of the diffuse interstellar medium ; the @xmath48 model ( hereafter wd5.5 ) fits the observed law of denser regions .",
    "we found in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) that some heavily extincted stars may only fit the wd5.5 dust model rather than the more traditional wd3.1 extinction law . in lower extinction regions both models tend to fit equally well",
    "therefore , for source classification we have chosen to use the wd5.5 dust model .",
    "the c2d data pipeline classifies sources according to their sed and infrared colors . among other classifications ,",
    "sources are identified as stars , ` galaxy candidates ' ( galc ) , or ` young stellar object candidates ' ( ysoc ) . with ysoc , galc , and other infrared excess sources",
    "we can not separate out the expected flux of the sed from changes in those fluxes due to variations in the extinction law .",
    "therefore , we want to concentrate on those sources classified as stars for studying the variations in the extinction law .    to create our high - reliability star catalogs we first selected all sources classified as stars , excluding those classified as stars when one waveband was dropped because we did not want a prominent absorption or emission line to bias our results .",
    "furthermore , because accurate extinctions are essential to our analysis , we required sources to have detections @xmath49 in each of the @xmath9 bands .",
    "lastly , we removed suspected faint background galaxies from our star catalogs using the criteria listed in  [ sec : cores - faintgalaxy ] .",
    "the number of stars in our high - reliability catalogs is : 3,244 ( l204c-2 ) , 4,038 ( l1152 ) , 3,926 ( l1155c-2 ) , and 1,850 ( l1228 ) .",
    "we then removed a few sources , as described below , to obtain our final catalogs .",
    "the percentage of sources removed is @xmath50 for l204c-2 , l1152 , and l1155c-2 , and 2.2% in l1228 .",
    "although we carefully selected only the most reliable stars to construct our catalogs , it appears that some faint background galaxies are misidentified as stars .",
    "this can be readily seen in figure [ fig : ahak - withgal ] , where we plot @xmath36 versus @xmath42 for the stars in our cores .",
    "the stars brighter than 15th magnitudes at @xmath15 ( black points ) follow the reddening vector , while many of the fainter sources ( gray crosses ) do not .",
    "the ` known ' stars and background galaxies are shown as white and dark gray circles , respectively .",
    "our method for creating these two populations of sources is described below .",
    "most of the ` known ' background galaxies are grouped to the right of the bright sources , in the same area as those gray crosses which do not follow the reddening vector .",
    "this suggests that these gray crosses are actually background galaxies .",
    "@xcite , using near - infrared data from perseus , also concluded that sources in this approximate region of a @xmath36 versus @xmath42 color - color diagram are likely to be background galaxies .",
    "background galaxies are not the only explanation for these sources .",
    "it is possible that a few of them may be ysos . in  [ sec : constraints ] we will discuss the prospects for faint ysos in the cores .    to create samples of ` known ' stars and background galaxies , we could not start from the high - reliability catalogs since those explicitly exclude non - star objects . instead , we began with the full catalogs and imposed the same @xmath51 cutoff in the @xmath9 bands as we did for the high - reliability star catalogs .",
    "second , we selected only those sources with @xmath6 m detections @xmath52 .",
    "the resultant sources are plotted in figure [ fig : corek24 ] .",
    "we used different symbols depending on how sources were classified in  [ sec : class ] : stars are shown as circles , galc sources are squares , ysoc s are shown as triangles , and plus signs for everything else .",
    "furthermore , the shaded contours are the c2d processed swire data of region elais n1 @xcite . since the elais n1 region is near the north galactic pole , it should contain nothing but stars and background galaxies making it useful for comparison . from this figure , we selected ` known ' populations of stars and background galaxies .",
    "the stars are those sources with @xmath53 \\leq 1 $ ] and the background galaxies have @xmath54 and @xmath53 \\geq 4 $ ] .",
    "we will follow a procedure similar to that in paper i to eliminate the misidentified background galaxies from our high - reliability star catalogs .",
    "first , we select suspected background galaxies with the following colors : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "these selections are shown as dashed lines in figure [ fig : ahak - withgal ] .",
    "then , just using the sources selected by these colors , we plotted them on two color - color diagrams in figure [ fig : cc - bad - cores ] along with our ` known ' star and background galaxy samples .",
    "there is a clear separation between the ` known ' stars and background galaxies .",
    "the dashed line in the figure is : @xmath58 , where x is either @xmath59 $ ] or @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "we combine these two selections to remove our misidentified background galaxies .",
    "these selection criteria are the same empirically derived ones used in paper i , but with one important difference : because there is such a large degree of non - overlap spatially between the four irac bands , we relaxed the second criterion from paper i so that sources only need to satisfy either the first half or the second half of it .",
    "our criteria are :    1 .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath56 , and @xmath62 2 .",
    "@xmath63)$ ] or @xmath64)$ ]    sources satisfying both criteria were removed from our catalogs .",
    "after removal of these sources , the number of stars in our final high - reliability catalogs is : 3,219 ( l204c-2 ) , 4,010 ( l1152 ) , 3,891 ( l1155c-2 ) , and 1,810 ( l1228 ) .",
    "our star catalogs contain a line - of - sight extinction measurement to each star calculated using the nicer technique @xcite and the wd5.5 dust model .",
    "we converted these randomly distributed samplings of the true extinction within each core into uniformly sampled maps by overlaying a grid on each core with an @xmath65 spacing between grid elements . at each grid position ,",
    "an extinction value was computed as the average of the individual measurements within a @xmath66 radius . this average is weighted both by the uncertainty of each line - of - sight extinction value and also by a gaussian function with full width half maximum ( fwhm ) equal to @xmath66 .",
    "thus , our final maps have @xmath66 resolution with 5 pixels across the fwhm . by setting our integration radius to equal the fwhm ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "we capture @xmath68 of the total area of the gaussian weighting function , and avoid the unrealistic scenario of utilizing extinction values from arbitrarily large distances away from each grid position .",
    "we subtracted foreground stars in a simple way : for each cell with more than 2 stars , we computed the mean and median @xmath45 values . if these two statistics differed by @xmath69 , then we dropped the source with the lowest @xmath45 and recomputed the mean .",
    "if the difference between the old and new mean is less than 25% , we re - added the dropped source to our catalog . after identifying all sources to drop , we recomputed the extinctions in every cell .",
    "despite its simpleness , we found this procedure to be very effective in removing foreground stars .",
    "the @xmath70 cutoff was empirically chosen after we ran some tests with different cutoff parameters .",
    "we chose the @xmath66 resolution because this gave us a reasonable number of stars per cell for good statistics .",
    "the median number of stars per cell is @xmath71 for l204c-2 , l1152 , and l1155c-2 , and 18 in l1228 .",
    "the percentage of cells with @xmath72 stars is @xmath73% in l1152 and l1155c-2 , @xmath74% in l204c-2 , and @xmath75% in l1228 .",
    "figures [ fig : l204c-2ak ] - [ fig : l1228ak ] are extinction maps of our four cores .",
    "the contours in each map start at @xmath76 mag in steps of 0.15 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we also plotted the ysoc and galc sources from our catalogs on the extinction maps and numbered the ysos from  [ sec : coreysos ] .",
    "lastly , because ysoc and galc sources can be classified only in regions with irac1 through irac4 and mips1 , we outlined the area in each core where all these bands overlap .",
    "the core of l204c-2 has a peak extinction of @xmath78 .",
    "extending northward from the central core is a dust filament with two other lower density extinction peaks .",
    "west of the core is a low density clump with a peak extinction of @xmath79 .",
    "we detect no ysos in l204c-2 .",
    "one galc object is located near the center of the core , however , as we will discuss in  [ sec : coreysos ] this source has an sed consistent with a heavily extincted background star .",
    "l1152 is a small core with peak @xmath80 . to the east",
    "are two additional separate extinction peaks .",
    "both of these have a lower column density than the main core .",
    "a bright ysoc is embedded in the primary core , slightly northeast of the extinction peak .",
    "one lobe of an outflow can be seen in @xmath13 through irac4 extending southwest from this yso .",
    "the other two ysos are northeast of the core , and slightly offset from the northernmost extinction peak .",
    "l1155c-2 is an extended core with two extinction peaks , the northernmost has a higher peak extinction of 1.7 magnitudes .",
    "a dust filament that is part of l1155e appears in the southern third of the map . like l204c-2",
    ", this core also appears starless .",
    "the central core of l1228 contains two extinction peaks and appears pinched in the middle .",
    "the peak extinction in this core is 2.2 magnitudes .",
    "this pinching may simply be an artifact caused by the lower median number of stars per cell compared with the other cores or it may indicate clearing by the outflow since the pinch direction lines up with the east - west outflow seen in figure [ fig : rgb - l1228 ] .",
    "several other extinction peaks are nearby , mostly north of the core .",
    "l1228 has previously been classified as a starred core , and several ysos are identified in the core ; most have not been previously identified . despite having similar galactic coordinates as l1152 and l1155c-2 , only two galc objects appear in this core .",
    "this is because l1152 and l1155c-2 have deeper @xmath9 data than l1228 , therefore many more galc objects fall into our high - reliability catalogs for those cores than in l1228 .",
    "ten sources are classified as ysoc in our cores",
    ". however , a source can be classified as a ysoc only if it is detected in all _ spitzer _ wavebands from @xmath5 to @xmath6 m .",
    "this is because various empirically derived _",
    "colors and magnitudes are used in classifying ysoc sources @xcite .",
    "therefore , to our initial list of 10 sources we added six potential ysos that were not classified as ysoc .",
    "first , we included sources from figure [ fig : corek24 ] with @xmath53 \\ge 3 $ ] and @xmath81 .",
    "most of the sources in this region are classified as ysos already .",
    "this selection added two sources in l1228 , neither of which is classified as ysoc because they are outside of the area observed in irac2 and irac4 ( @xmath82 and @xmath7 m ) .",
    "it is also possible that faint ysos may be misidentified as galc .",
    "therefore , we also selected four galc objects from figures [ fig : l204c-2ak]-[fig : l1228ak ] that were located near the dense cores ; one source each in l204c-2 and l1152 and two in l1228 .",
    "this brought our total number of possible ysos to 16 .",
    "after we visually inspected all 16 sources , we excluded the galc objects in l1152 and l1228 since all were visually extended in mosaics , meaning they are likely to be true background galaxies .",
    "we also excluded the one galc object from l204c-2 because this source has the sed of a heavily extincted star . in figure",
    "[ fig : corek24 ] , this source is the galc at @xmath53 = 1.5 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we excluded one of the ysoc objects in l1228 that is clearly a knot of emission from the outflow and not a real source .",
    "lastly , we also excluded one of the non - ysoc sources in l1228 that only has an infrared excess at @xmath6 m .",
    "the @xmath6 m flux for this source appears confused with two other nearby sources detected at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we are left with 10 ysos , three in l1152 and seven in l1228 .",
    "note that now we are identifying these sources as young stellar objects and not young stellar object candidates . in table",

    "neither l204c-2 nor l1155c-2 appear to contain any ysos . in ",
    "[ sec : constraints ] we will place some upper limits on unidentified ysos in our cores .    we modeled the sed for our 10 ysos using an online tool @xcite .",
    "this tool fits an input sed to a pre - computed grid of yso models . in figure",
    "[ fig : yso - sed ] we show all models with @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the @xmath4 for the best - fitting model . the best - fit model for each yso",
    "is shown in black with other models shown in gray .",
    "each model has numerous parameters , a few of which we have listed in table [ tab : robitaille ] .",
    "we show the range of values for envelope accretion rate , disk mass , interstellar extinction ( @xmath35 ) , and bolometric luminosity plus the average value for each quantity .",
    "note that the robitaille models do include stellar masses , however these are not constrained for embedded objects , so we will not use them here ( robitaille , private communication ) .",
    "we also classified our ysos based on their value of @xmath86 , the best - fit slope of a straight line to the sed from @xmath15 to @xmath6 m .",
    "we then separated the ysos into one of four classes using the method of @xcite . following an evolutionary sequence from youngest to oldest yso , they are : class i ( @xmath87 ) ; flat spectrum ( @xmath88 ) ; class ii ( @xmath89 ) ; and class iii ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we have included sources with @xmath91 in class i since these were undefined by @xcite .",
    "our ysos are a mixture of class i , flat spectrum , and class ii sources , but no class iii objects .",
    "this suggests that the yso population in these cores is relatively young .",
    "two of the three ysos in l1152 , iras 20353 + 6742 and iras 20359 + 6745 , are previously known and both have outflows associated with them .",

    "we show both of these features in figure [ fig : rgb - l1152 ] .",
    "the remaining yso is approximately @xmath93 to the west of iras 20359 + 6745 .",
    "we found no references to this source in simbad .",
    "we identified seven ysos in l1228 .",
    "six of these are classified as ysoc based on their colors while the remaining one can not be classified as such because it appears outside of the area covered by irac2 and irac4 .",
    "five of the ysoc sources appear to be spatially coincident with the core of l1228 .",
    "the brightest source is # 7 and is identified as iras 20582 + 7724 .",
    "this is the only previously known yso in the core of l1228 .",
    "it appears to be the driving source for a co outflow , hh 199 @xcite .",
    "the axis of the co outflow is about @xmath94 different from the east - west axis formed by the infrared knots . @xcite",
    "conclude this is likely due to precession of the jet that drives the outflow . in figure",
    "[ fig : rgb - l1228 ] the green dashed line shows the axis of the infrared knots while the red dashed line shows the axis of the co outflow .",
    "sources # 5 and # 6 are located about @xmath95 northwest of iras 20582 + 7724 and separated from each other by @xmath96 .",
    "because of this separation , they are not resolved at @xmath83 m ( @xmath97 ) and not fully resolved at @xmath6 m ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "even though we were able to extract a flux at @xmath6 m for both sources , we suspect that the @xmath6 m flux for source # 6 is artificially high . when fitting yso models , we found that excluding this datapoint decreased @xmath85 from 174 to 48 , the latter is more in line with the @xmath85 for the other sources .",
    "therefore , we excluded this datapoint for the models listed in table [ tab : robitaille ] and shown in figure [ fig : yso - sed ] .",
    "it is also possible that the @xmath83 m flux for source # 5 includes some contribution from source # 6 as well .",
    "@xcite detected a series of infrared emission knots that form the hh 200 outflow which has its origin at the position of sources # 5 and # 6 .",
    "it is unknown which of these is the driving source of the outflow .",
    "we show the approximate axis of this outflow as a yellow dashed line in figure [ fig : rgb - l1228 ] .",
    "there is some outflow emission immediately to the northeast of sources # 5 and # 6 which lies along the outflow axis .",
    "lastly , the two ysos not spatially coincident with the l1228 core are sources # 4 and # 10 .",
    "source # 10 does not meet the criteria for ysoc because it is lacking irac2 and irac4 fluxes .",
    "we did not detect any ysoc sources that were not already detected by c2d .",
    "the converse is also true , in the c2d catalogs of all four cores , there is only one ysoc object not in our catalogs .",
    "however , after inspection we determined this object to be another emission knot from the east - west outflow .",
    "this lack of additional ysoc sources is not too surprising since the ysoc selection criteria were tuned to the sensitivity of the c2d - processed swire data .",
    "therefore , any sources fainter than those limits are likely to be automatically classified as galc .",
    "it was for this reason that we also considered some galc sources when compiling our yso catalog .",
    "however , from figures [ fig : rgb - l204c-2]-[fig : rgb - l1228 ] it is clear that there are many bright @xmath6 m sources in our cores , far more than the number of ysoc and galc objects .",
    "we would like to use these objects to place limits on possible faint ysos in these cores .",
    "if we select sources from the overlap region of all five bands with @xmath6 m detections @xmath99 , then exclude any star or ysoc sources and also any galc sources in figure [ fig : corek24 ] , we are left with 634 sources in all four cores .",
    "these 634 sources have a median @xmath6 m flux of 0.21 mjy ( 11.3 magnitude ) .",
    "just 47 of them are detected at @xmath15 , but these have a median flux of 0.04 mjy ( 18.1 magnitude ) .",
    "our @xmath100 detection limit for @xmath15 is 18.4 magnitudes , or 19.3 magnitudes for the deep observations . if we assume that the remaining sources must be fainter than these limits in order to be undetected at @xmath15 , that means they must have @xmath53 \\gtrsim 7 - 8 $ ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : corek24 ] , the boundary between flat / class i is at @xmath53 = 8.31 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we expect any new ysos existing among these 634 sources to be fainter than 18 - 19 magnitudes at @xmath15 and to be very young flat / class i objects .    to put an upper limit on the luminosity of any embedded ysos , we integrated our median sed assuming a blackbody extrapolation shortward of @xmath13 band and longward of @xmath6 m .",
    "the temperature of the blackbody was derived from the flux ratio of the first two and last two wavelengths , for the shortward and longward extrapolations , respectively .",
    "the luminosity ranges from @xmath1 l@xmath101 for l204c-2 ( the closest core ) to @xmath2 l@xmath101 for the two furthest cores ( l1152 and l1155c-2 ) .",
    "are any of these sources ysos ? to answer this question is beyond the scope of this paper . however , given that the sources are distributed throughout the observed regions , it is very likely that most , if not all , are background galaxies .",
    "spectra of individual sources would be needed to identify any ysos hidden among the galaxies .",
    "the dust properties affect the extinction law .",
    "so , to study the dust properties , we will compute the extinction law . by using the extinctions computed from the @xmath9 bands we can extrapolate the extinction law in the _ spitzer _ wavebands .",
    "starting from equation [ eq : fit ] , but using @xmath45 instead of @xmath35 , we re - arrange it to solve for @xmath102 , defined as @xmath103 :    @xmath104\\ ] ]    since we are only interested in _ differences _ in the extinction law , we can subtract @xmath105 to eliminate the need for @xmath33 , the scaling factor .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( all stellar models are scaled relative to @xmath15 ) , the equation simplifies to :    @xmath108 + 1\\ ] ]    for @xmath41 we will use the average stellar model derived in appendix [ sec : avgmodel ] .      in this section",
    "we will create a two - dimensional map of how the extinction law changes in each core .",
    "we start by defining a reduced @xmath4 for each star :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is computed from equation [ eq : cext ] , @xmath111 is the extinction law for a given dust model , and @xmath112 is the uncertainty in @xmath113 .",
    "we sum only over the irac bands because , as we will see , the extinction law at @xmath6 m does not fit any current dust models and therefore we excluded this wavelength to avoid biasing our @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we excluded any negative values for @xmath46 as unphysical",
    ". we will discuss the biases introduced by this assumption in  [ sec : error ]",
    ". we will refer to this reduced @xmath4 as `` @xmath4 '' in this paper .    using equation [ eq : chi2 ] we computed the line - of - sight @xmath4 value for each star .",
    "then , to convert our line - of - sight measurements into a map , we followed the same procedure as we did when creating our @xmath45 maps . in figures [ fig : l204c-2-chi2 ] - [ fig : l1228-chi2 ] we show maps of the extinction and @xmath4 calculated using both the wd3.1 and wd5.5 dust models .",
    "the @xmath4 maps have the same resolution as the extinction maps , @xmath66 .",
    "our contours start at @xmath114 because we observe a definite transition between the wd3.1 and wd5.5 dust models at this approximate @xmath4 value ( see figure [ fig : cores - chi2ak ] ) .",
    "statistically , a @xmath114 would arise by chance about @xmath26 of the time .",
    "the correspondence between the extinction , @xmath45 , and the @xmath47 @xmath4 maps is quite remarkable . in all of our cores , the overall shape and the extinction peaks",
    "are mirrored in the wd3.1 @xmath4 map .",
    "many of the extinction features not associated with the cores also appear in the @xmath4 map such as the dusty filament to the north of l204c-2 , the two separate extinction peaks in l1152 , and much of the structure in l1228 .    to make a quantitative comparison between @xmath4 and @xmath45 , we binned our data in @xmath45 and for each bin determined the average @xmath4 with both the wd3.1 and wd5.5 models .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fig : cores - chi2ak ] .",
    "@xmath115 @xmath4 is shown in black while @xmath48 is shown in gray . at low extinction , @xmath116 , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath4 are very similar to each other , suggesting that at low extinctions it is difficult to distinguish between these two models with our technique . above @xmath117",
    "the @xmath47 @xmath4 rises sharply while the @xmath48 @xmath4 stays roughly constant or increases only slightly .",
    "the observed behavior in our @xmath4 maps is consistent with the idea of grain growth in dense cores .",
    "most regions of moderate to high extinction show up in the @xmath47 @xmath4 map but not in the @xmath48 @xmath4 map .",
    "this suggests the wd3.1 extinction law is _ not _ valid in extincted regions because @xmath114 ( the first contour level ) corresponds to at least a 95% chance that the data do not fit the model .",
    "the differences in these two extinction laws is reflected by the differences in the properties of the dust models .",
    "the wd3.1 dust model was constructed to match observations of the diffuse ism .",
    "in contrast , the wd5.5 model has significantly fewer small silicate grains ( @xmath118 m ) and significantly more large carbonaceous ones ( maximum radius @xmath119 larger ) .",
    "although most of our observations can be explained by the idea of grain growth within dense regions , both l1152 and l1228 contain regions that appear strong in the wd5.5 @xmath4 map .",
    "both of these cores have outflows associated with them which may be changing the dust sizes and compositions . in the next section ,",
    "we explore changes in the observed extinction law as a function of wavelength and @xmath45 .",
    "this will help us to understand exactly how the dust is changing within our cores .      as we saw in the last section",
    ", the @xmath4 is strongly dependent on @xmath45 . to explore this further ,",
    "we started by binning the observed extinction law for each star into three @xmath45 ranges : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . in each extinction bin , we combined the individual @xmath110 measurements to obtain a weighted average value of @xmath46 .",
    "as we did when computing @xmath4 , we again excluded any negative values of @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig : coreaklaw ] shows the observed average extinction law as a function of wavelength for our cores .",
    "each row is a different core and each column is a different range of @xmath45 .",
    "the errorbars for each data point are the minimum uncertainty due to systematic errors in measuring flux .",
    "in addition to the wd3.1 and wd5.5 dust models , we also plot a third one , labeled kp v5.0 ( pontoppidian et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "this model is one from a grid of models constructed starting from the @xcite parameterization of the grain size distribution .",
    "icy mantles of water and other volatiles were then added .",
    "the specific model we use from this grid is the one with the `` best fit '' to the c2d mid - infrared extinction law and ice features .",
    "several ice absorption features in this model can be seen in the figures , these are due to h@xmath123o , co@xmath123 , or co.      from @xmath5 to @xmath7 m , our extinction law is relatively flat for all ranges of @xmath45 with the trend that it becomes slightly flatter as @xmath45 increases . in table",
    "[ tab : extlaw ] we list the average extinction law combined over all four cores ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "again , the uncertainties represent the minimum error due to uncertainty in the flux . for comparison we also list the extinction law from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and our three dust models .",
    "our data are in good agreement with other authors results and also with the wd5.5 dust model .",
    "our flat extinction law for @xmath120 seems surprising since this result contradicts our expectation that low extinction regions should follow wd3.1 , a diffuse interstellar medium dust model . in paper",
    "i we calculated the extinction law in three molecular clouds and found that for @xmath125 the extinction law was consistent with wd3.1",
    ". these conflicting results may be because extinction measures the column density , not the number density , along the line - of - sight .",
    "if we assume each core has an approximate angular size of @xmath126 ( the lengthwise distance of any irac observation ) , and given the distances listed in table [ tab : corebasic ] , then our cores have linear sizes of @xmath127 au .",
    "compare these sizes to those of the clouds in paper i. the cloud distances in table 1 of that paper are @xmath128 pc ( ophiuchus ) , @xmath129 pc ( perseus ) , and @xmath130 pc ( serpens ) .",
    "assuming cloud angular sizes of @xmath131 , then the clouds have linear sizes of @xmath132 au . finally ,",
    "if we assume spherical clouds and cores , then these linear sizes also represent the depth of each cloud and core .",
    "therefore , the number densities in our cores may be up to @xmath133 larger than in our clouds for a given column density ( extinction ) .",
    "grain growth is a collisional process and proceeds more rapidly at higher number densities .",
    "hence , the grains in our isolated cores quickly achieve at least modest grain growth ( represented by wd5.5 and kp v5.0 ) compared with the wd3.1 dust grains .",
    "l1152 and l1155c-2 both show a strong deviation at @xmath134 m from wd5.5 for @xmath122 .",
    "water ice has an absorption peak at @xmath135 m due to h - o - h bending @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the high value of @xmath136 is due to the presence of water ice in these two cores , even more than predicted by the kp5.0 dust model .",
    "mid - infrared spectra will be necessary to address this possibility .",
    "we have only 13 stars with positive @xmath137 values .",
    "these have an average value of @xmath138 .",
    "this value compares favorably with other empirical results .",
    "@xcite were able to measure the @xmath6 m extinction law for two of their five regions and found @xmath139 and @xmath140 for serpens and ngc 2068/71 , respectively .",
    "even though @xcite did not measure the extinction longward of @xmath141 m , if their flat extinction law were projected out to @xmath6 m , it would also have a value of @xmath142 .",
    "our result also agrees with paper i ( when a model flux of 0.012 mjy at @xmath6 m was assumed ) .    although the empirical results agree with each other , they are much higher than the @xmath6 m extinction law predicted by dust models .",
    "our average value for @xmath137 is @xmath143 larger than either the wd3.1 or wd5.5 models .",
    "the kp v5.0 dust model has a much broader @xmath144 m silicate peak which significantly raises the predicted @xmath6 m extinction .",
    "even so , it is still too low by about @xmath145 compared to our empirical measurement .",
    "new dust models will need to incorporate additional extinction at @xmath6 m .",
    "we circled in red two regions in l1152 and l1228 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : l1152-chi2 ] and [ fig : l1228-chi2 ] ) with high @xmath146 @xmath4 .",
    "these regions stand out because their high @xmath4 values are not caused by a single star , nor are they associated with regions of high @xmath45 .",
    "we selected all the sources within the red circles and within the @xmath114 contour and plotted the average extinction law for each region in figure [ fig : aklaw - blobs ] .",
    "compared to elsewhere in the cores , the extinction law is much steeper in these two regions and more similar to the wd3.1 dust model rather than wd5.5 .",
    "because these regions are near known outflows , one possible explanation is that the outflows in each core have destroyed the bigger dust grains via shocks to produce a dust grain distribution that more closely resembles the wd3.1 diffuse ism dust .",
    "since neither region lines up with the outflow axis , this may be evidence for precession of the outflows , which is already observed in l1228 @xcite .",
    "these extinction laws could not be caused by a foreground star skewing the average because we have a total of 35 stars in the two selected regions , none with @xmath147 .",
    "a foreground star would appear to have almost zero or negative extinction , and would not greatly impact the average extinction law .        in this paper",
    "we have excluded negative values for @xmath148 as unphysical because it would imply that dust amplification , rather than extinction , is occurring .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the derived extinction or the measured flux for that wavelength is incorrect . by excluding these negative values",
    ", we introduce some potential bias into our results , which will be discussed here .    the magnitude of the bias varies with wavelength and extinction , but is much larger at low @xmath45 .",
    "the percentage of negative @xmath148 values for a given wavelength ranges from @xmath149 for @xmath150 , @xmath151 for @xmath152 , and @xmath153 for @xmath122 .",
    "if we utilized these negative @xmath148 values when computing the average extinction law , then the averages shown in figure [ fig : coreaklaw ] would be @xmath154 lower for @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the displayed errorbar due to the minimum uncertainty in the flux . for higher extinctions ,",
    "the bias is much lower because there are far fewer negative @xmath148 values .",
    "the average extinction law decreases @xmath157 for @xmath158 and for @xmath159 , the decrease is @xmath160 .",
    "the large bias we find for @xmath150 suggests that our technique for computing the extinction law breaks down at low extinctions .",
    "we discussed this before in relation to figure [ fig : cores - chi2ak ] .",
    "we have not attempted to incorporate any bias from excluding the negative @xmath148 into our errorbars since the bias is partially due to the fluxes , and we already set a lower limit on the errors due to our minimum uncertainty in measuring the fluxes at different wavelengths .",
    "however , our results presented in this paper may slightly overestimate the mid - infrared extinction law , primarily for @xmath161 .",
    "many authors have fit the near - infrared extinction to a power law , @xmath162 , with @xmath163 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the wd3.1 and wd5.5 models are very similar in the near - infrared @xmath9 bands , reflecting this apparent universality of the near - infrared extinction law .",
    "these two models both have @xmath164 .",
    "this law does agree with the apparent reddening vector in our data ( see figure [ fig : ahak - withgal ] ) and makes our results directly comparable with other authors results who have made the same assumption .",
    "however , it is possible that the extinction law could be steeper in some regions .",
    "this would introduce another source of error into our calculated extinction law . to calculate the magnitude of this effect",
    ", we modified the wd5.5 dust model to have @xmath165 in the @xmath9 bands and used this law instead of the wd5.5 model for classifying sources and computing the extinctions and the extinction law .",
    "our results can be seen in table [ tab : extlaw ] and figure [ fig : beta18 ] . as stated before , the uncertainties in our average extinction law are the minimum errors due to uncertainty in the flux .    using a @xmath165 law slightly decreases our mid - infrared extinction law , however the qualitative results of this paper are unchanged . even with @xmath166 our extinction law is more consistent with wd5.5 for all ranges of extinction .",
    "the biggest difference is for @xmath122 in l1152 and l1155c-2 . with @xmath166 , the excess @xmath136",
    "extinction disappears .",
    "we argued in ",
    "[ sec : spatiallawirac ] that this excess could possibly be explained by the existence of water ice in these two cores .",
    "the circled regions in our @xmath4 figures that may be caused by outflows destroying the big dust grains appear even stronger with our @xmath165 law .",
    "this is because the difference from wd5.5 is enhanced .",
    "in this paper we presented deep @xmath9 and _ spitzer _ photometry of four isolated cores : l204c-2 , l1152 , l1155c-2 , and l1228 . based on previous observations ,",
    "two of these cores were classified as starred and two were classified as starless .",
    "our data support these original classifications .",
    "we detect 10 ysos , three within l1152 , seven within l1228 , and none within l204c-2 or l1155c-2 .",
    "seven of these ysos have not been previously discovered . among these , we are able to resolve the driving source of the hh200 outflow in l1228 into two sources separated by @xmath96 , but we were unable to identify which of the two sources is responsible for the outflow .    to put constraints on possible faint ysos in all four cores , we selected 634 sources with @xmath6 m detections @xmath99 which are either undetected or too faint at other wavelengths to be considered in our high reliability catalogs .",
    "we computed the median sed for these sources and integrated the sed to obtain a luminosity of @xmath167 to @xmath168 l@xmath101 with colors of a very young flat spectrum or class i yso @xcite .",
    "in addition to studying the yso content of these cores , we used the line - of - sight measurements of the extinction and the extinction law to create maps of the extinction and @xmath4 deviation from specific dust grain models .",
    "our extinction law is nearly flat for all ranges of extinction in all four cores . in the irac bands ( @xmath11 m )",
    "this extinction law matches the predictions of the wd5.5 dust model , a model designed to simulate the grain growth that occurs in dense regions , and also agrees with the other authors results @xcite . in the densest regions of l1152 and l1155c-2 , the @xmath134 m extinction law is higher than the wd5.5 model",
    ". this could be evidence for water ice in these cores or a steeper near - infrared extinction law than the average value . at @xmath6",
    "m , our data are consistent with the extinction law remaining constant as the total extinction increases .",
    "the observed extinction law is much higher than that predicted by dust grain models , but does confirm the similarly large value found by other authors @xcite .    from the @xmath4 maps we identified cavities in l1152 and l1228 where the extinction law is more consistent with the wd3.1 dust model .",
    "the molecular outflows in these cores produce shocks , which may be destroying the large dust grains , thus producing a dust distribution similar to wd3.1 these cavities are visible in our @xmath4 maps , but would be missed in averages over an entire core .",
    "it is critical to create new dust grain models which reproduce the observed flat extinction law , especially at @xmath6 m . in this paper",
    "we used the @xcite models to estimate the luminosities of our ysos .",
    "however , @xcite assumed an extinction law that is between wd3.1 and wd5.5 in the irac bands and predicts a @xmath6 m extinction that is about @xmath70 of our observed value .",
    "the best - fit yso parameters would undoubtedly change with a flatter extinction law .",
    "furthermore , it is important to understand the mid - infrared extinction law because future telescopes , such as the james webb space telescope , will operate at these wavelengths .",

    "to compute the expected stellar distribution for each core , we used the galaxy model from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "given the galactic coordinates , distance , and average extinction for a core , this model produces source counts broken down by spectral type .",
    "these source counts provide a rudimentary weighting function that can be used in computing the average stellar model .",
    "however , a weighting function from the raw source counts ignores the reality that not all spectral types are equally observable at each wavelength .",
    "our next step was to correct for the detection limits of our actual observations .",
    "the galaxy model lists the extincted @xmath15 magnitude for each star and its extinction , @xmath35 .",
    "we used this information , the @xcite @xmath47 extinction law , and the stellar templates from the ssc s `` star - pet '' tool to compute the magnitude of each star at every observed waveband from @xmath13 to @xmath6 m .",
    "we then arbitrarily discarded any detection falling below the @xmath100 cutoff for the given waveband ( table [ tab : limits ] ) .",
    "lastly , we used the normalized , final , corrected source counts at each waveband as a weighting function , and computed the overall average stellar model .",
    "we repeated this procedure using both the @xcite @xmath48 extinction law and also using the magnitude limits from our deeper @xmath9 observations .",
    "both variables have a negligible effect on the final fluxes .",
    "after these calculations , we made one final adjustment to our average stellar model .",
    "in paper i we determined that the above method produces a @xmath6 m flux that is very likely too high .",
    "however , we can independently put an upper - limit on the @xmath6 m flux value .",
    "if we select all stars with line - of - sight @xmath120 and compute the average @xmath6 m to @xmath15 flux ratio , this will give us an estimate of the true average @xmath6 m stellar flux .",
    "since these stars have small amounts of extinction , this ratio will over - estimate the true value because the @xmath15 band is more extincted than @xmath6 m . there are 28 stars in our cores with @xmath6 m fluxes @xmath169 and within the extinction range @xmath120 .",
    "these have an average @xmath6 m to @xmath15 flux of @xmath170 with an average extinction of 0.19 @xmath45 .",
    "this is the same as the value derived using the galaxy count models .",
    "given the non - zero average extinction , the true flux ratio will be lower .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will assume it is actually 0.012 .",
    "our final average stellar flux for the @xmath9 , irac1 - 4 , and mips1 bands , respectively , is : @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 .",
    "note that all fluxes are scaled relative to the @xmath15 band .",
