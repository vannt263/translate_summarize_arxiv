    "the application of long - baseline optical interferometry to the study of classical be stars , although still a developing observational field , has already resulted in significant contributions to our understanding of these objects .",
    "this is in part related to the fact that the circumstellar regions associated with the closest be stars can be spatially resolved using optical interferometers with only modest baseline lengths ( 1040  m ) , especially if the observations are sensitive to the h@xmath2 line emission .",
    "the interferometric observations at such baselines typically yield only angular sizes of the emitting regions , and in some cases also the apparent ellipticity .",
    "however , when these types of results are combined with polarimetry or spectroscopy , then a number of different intrinsic properties of these regions can be investigated or constrained .",
    "for example , @xcite combined optical interferometric and spectropolarimetric observations of seven be stars and showed that the disk orientation inferred from the two completely independent data sets agree . furthermore , because the smallest upper limit on the disk opening angle derived by @xcite from the apparent ellipticity of the circumstellar region was @xmath320@xmath4 , this was the first study that spatially resolved the circumstellar disks and supported the thin - disk paradigm for be stars .",
    "@xcite constructed disk models for the be star @xmath5  tau with large ( tens of degrees ) and small ( few degrees ) disk opening angles , where both models were consistent with the spectropolarimetry . using the interferometric results of @xcite the large opening angle solution was rejected by @xcite .",
    "another example of the synergy between spectroscopy and long - baseline interferometry was demonstrated by @xcite when the observations of the be star @xmath5  tau at two epochs were used to detect the presence of a one - armed oscillation in the circumstellar disk . in a similar study , @xcite",
    "have shown that the variable asymmetric brightness distribution in the disk of @xmath0  cas deduced from the optical interferometric data correlate with the spectral variations seen in the h@xmath6 emission line , and these in turn can also be explained with a precessing one - armed oscillation in the equatorial disk . although the combination of spectroscopic and interferometric observations is necessary in studies related to temporal variability , these types of data sets can also be combined to put direct constraints on the physical conditions within the circumstellar regions of be stars .",
    "for example , @xcite combined h@xmath2 emission profiles from spectroscopy with interferometric observations in h@xmath2 for a number of different be stars and showed that there exists a direct relationship between the physical extent of the emitting region and the net h@xmath2 luminosity .",
    "the total number of be stars investigated with optical interferometry to date still remains quite small .",
    "this can be attributed to the relatively small number of long - baseline interferometric instruments that are sensitive to one of the strongest spectral features produced within the circumstellar disk , i.e. , the h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "even the instruments that are sensitive to the h@xmath2 emission line , or any other emission line for that matter , and have baselines long enough to spatially resolve the circumstellar regions , still need to separate the signatures from the resolved disk and the unresolved ( or nearly unresolved ) central star that is detected at the continuum wavelengths .",
    "for this reason , it is imperative that the instrument be configured such that the contribution from the stellar photosphere to the interferometric observations at the h@xmath2 line is minimized .",
    "this can be accomplished by either sufficiently high spectral dispersion or with the use of narrowband filters .",
    "the navy prototype optical interferometer  ( npoi ) is by design a multi - spectral instrument .",
    "however , the continuum bandpass recorded by the instrument in the h@xmath2 region , as defined by the spectral channel characteristics , can be too wide for sources with weak h@xmath2 emission .",
    "therefore , as part of a proof - of - concept , we equipped the npoi with a set of custom narrowband filters filters were manufactured by david e. upton of omega optical , brattleboro , vt . ] centered on the h@xmath2 line to further decrease the stellar contribution at the continuum wavelengths in the spectral channel containing the h@xmath2 emission line  @xcite .",
    "these initial observations demonstrated that , with only small modifications to our current instrumental configuration , interferometric observations of be stars can be obtained with the narrowband filters .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the quantitative results based on the narrowband interferometric observations of two stars known for their relatively strong h@xmath2 emission , @xmath0  cassiopeiae  ( = hr  264 ) and @xmath1  persei  ( = hr  496 ) .",
    "because the circumstellar regions of both stars were resolved by long - baseline interferometry in the past , they are suitable targets for direct comparison of the results produced by the new observational setup with those already presented in the literature  @xcite .",
    "also , the interferometric observations presented in this study represent some of the highest spatial resolution measurements of the h@xmath2-emitting regions obtained to date .",
    "this allows us to test the various models for intensity distribution at high enough spatial frequencies so that the degeneracy between the various models is eliminated .",
    "the npoi consists of four stationary astrometric stations and a y - shaped imaging station configuration where movable siderostat elements can be repositioned  ( see the description of the instrument by * ? ? ?",
    "currently , two movable stations are operational . the goal is to have six movable stations that will allow simultaneous observations with up to six reconfigurable elements .",
    "although the successful combination of light from six stations has been already demonstrated with the npoi  @xcite , at the time of the observations presented in this paper only four stations were available for observations .",
    "these four stations gave access to baselines with lengths in the range of 18.9 to 64.4  m , as shown schematically in figure  [ fig : baselines ] .",
    "the instrument was designed to accept stellar light from up to 6 siderostats simultaneously , where each element sends a 12  cm light beam through vacuum pipes to the beam combiner lab . at the beam combiner ,",
    "the light beams are split and recombined in such a way that the interference fringes between all siderostat pairs  ( for a total of 15 unique pairs ) are constructed . figure  [ fig : beamcombiner ] illustrates the propagation of light for six input beams .",
    "the three output beams that are intercepted are dispersed by a set of three prisms onto individual lenslet arrays , which in turn are fiber - coupled to a cluster of photon - counting avalanche photodiodes .",
    "each fiber corresponds to a single channel with spectral characteristics set by the position of the lenslet array and the physical width of a single lenslet along the dispersion direction .",
    "the spectra of be stars show many spectral lines in emission .",
    "for example , in the 510880  nm region covered by our interferometric observations emission lines of elements such as h  i , he  i , o  i , si  ii , and fe  ii can be detected .",
    "however , except for hydrogen lines all of the emission lines are very weak having equivalent widths  ( ew ) of @xmath7  0.1  nm , and therefore will be lost in the continuum signal present in each spectral channel  ( the widths of the spectral channels range from 10 to 26  nm ) . even in the case of the hydrogen lines present in our spectral region of interest",
    "only the h@xmath2 line has large enough ew to contribute a detectable interferometric signal in the h@xmath2 containing channel .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of the h@xmath2 observations , the lenslet array is aligned such that the emission line is centered on a single channel that has a spectral width of 15  nm . because the typical equivalent widths of h@xmath2 emission lines in be stars are usually not more than 4  nm  ( see for example table 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the contribution from the circumstellar region to the net signal is typically less than 25  % . for sources with very weak emission , the fractional contribution to the net signal can be much less than the magnitude of the random and systematic uncertainties , which are typically at the few percent level .    to increase the contrast between the interferometric signatures from the h@xmath2-emitting circumstellar region and the central star , we have inserted a narrowband filter at each of the three outputs from the beam combiner  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : beamcombiner ] ) .",
    "these filters have a high transmission  ( @xmath390  % ) in a 2.8  nm region centered on the h@xmath2 line , which suppresses the nearby continuum emission , but does not significantly attenuate radiation outside a @xmath3100  nm region centered at the line . because we need to detect the interferometric signal outside of the spectral channel containing the h@xmath2 emission , for both calibration and fringe tracking purposes",
    ", the filter has high enough transmission in the 500600 and 710850  nm regions that the continuum channels are still usable .",
    "the transmission curve of the custom - made filter is shown in figure  [ fig : filter ] along with the superposed locations of the spectral channels that were used to record the fringe signals .    in the current instrumental setup the signals from up to 32 channels can be recorded simultaneously by the npoi electronics . because these channels are divided equally between two output beams from the beam combiner , data from one of the three output beams is currently not recorded  ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : beamcombiner ] ) .",
    "this results in interferometric observations that do not sample all the baseline configurations that are possible with a given set of elements , as shown in figure  [ fig : baselines ] . furthermore , because the long - delay lines are not implemented yet , the maximum path difference that can be introduced between a pair of siderostats  ( to compensate for the different distances between each station and the star ) is currently 35  m and this results in restricted ranges of declination and hour angle over which a star can be observed at a given baseline .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : sky ] shows the accessible sky coverage for three different configurations ; in one case all four elements ( ac , aw , ae , and w7 ) are used and in the other two configurations either the ac or the w7 station is excluded .",
    "therefore , for @xmath0  cas the observations utilizing the ac  w7 baseline are not currently possible , whereas for @xmath1  per , which is 10@xmath4 lower in the sky , such observations are possible . of course ,",
    "with the expected implementation of the long delay - lines , optical path difference compensation of up to @xmath3400  m will become possible and the accessible sky coverage will be significantly less restrictive .",
    "the typical npoi observing and data reduction procedures are described in @xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief review of the process . during a",
    "30  s observation fringe data are recorded every 2  ms .",
    "the squared visibility  ( @xmath8 ) estimators from the 2  ms data are averaged on 1  s intervals and the 1  s data points are processed using a suite of custom reduction software .",
    "outlier points are flagged on the basis of the residuals of the delay , seeing indicators , photon rates , and squared visibilities .",
    "finally , depending on how many 1  s data points have been flagged as bad , up to 30 points are averaged to produce a single squared visibility measure for each 30  s interval , also known as a `` scan '' . typically , following a procedure similar to that used in obtaining the @xmath8 data",
    ", the closure phase and triple amplitude can also be obtained for each scan . however , because these quantities were not obtained for the data presented in this paper , we do not include them in our discussion .",
    "the @xmath8 value for a single scan is obtained in the same way for both the target and the calibrator star , as well as for the incoherent scans  ( also known as the `` off - the - fringe scans '' ) .",
    "the typical observational sequence consists of a pair of coherent and incoherent scans on a target , followed by the same pair of scans on a calibrator .",
    "the procedure is repeated for as long as the scans of the target star are acquired .",
    "the incoherent scans are necessary to estimate the additive bias terms affecting the squared visibility measures  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "the bias term is a squared visibility measure that one obtains in the case of a completely incoherent signal , which for an ideal system should be exactly zero . because the calibration procedure removes multiplicative effects , the subtraction of the additive bias term must be performed before calibration corrections are applied .",
    "we remove the bias terms from the squared visibilities of both the target and the calibrator stars following the method described in @xcite and @xcite .    as we have discussed in ",
    "[ sec : setup ] , @xmath0  cas could not be observed on the ac ",
    "w7 baseline because of its high declination that places the star outside the accessible sky coverage  ( defined by the limits imposed by the optical path compensation components ) .",
    "@xmath1  per was not constrained by the same limitation having slightly lower declination . because the two stars are separated in right ascension by less than 50  min it was more efficient to observe both stars in the same mode  ( i.e. , using only 3 stations ) .",
    "the loss of one station for @xmath1  per was compensated by the extended hour angle range over which it was possible to observe this star  ( recall fig .  [",
    "fig : sky ] ) .",
    "another advantage of having only one baseline on each spectrograph is the elimination of multi - baseline cross - talk effects that may be present in the data  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of having only two simultaneous baselines is that some interferometric observables such as closure phase and triple amplitude could not be obtained because they require at least three simultaneous baselines .",
    "we observed @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per during november and december of 2004 .",
    "although we lost many nights due to poor weather , we still managed to obtain @xmath3100 scans for each star with almost all the scans providing data on two baselines .",
    "table  [ tab : obslog ] shows a log of the observations . on 2004",
    "dec 8 the vacuum pipes between the 6th and 7th station on each of the three arms were disconnected  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : baselines ] for the layout of the imaging array ) in order to install safety vacuum valves .",
    "this resulted in the w7 station being unavailable for observations starting 2004 dec 10 , and therefore , only observations utilizing the ae , ac and aw stations were recorded for the rest of the observing run . on 2004  dec",
    "2 we temporarily removed the narrowband filters from the outputs of the beam combiner to obtain observations without the use of the filters , but with the same instrumental configuration .    for the purpose of the analysis presented in this paper , we are only interested in the squared visibilities from the spectral channels that contain the h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "however , before these @xmath8 values can be extracted from the observational data set , we need to calibrate these quantities .",
    "we follow the calibration procedure outlined in @xcite , which we only summarize here .",
    "the calibration procedure uses the continuum channels at a given scan and baseline to estimate a correction function that has a quadratic dependence in @xmath9 , which is then applied to the squared visibility measure in the spectral channel that contains the h@xmath2 emission line . because the correction function is a slowly varying function across channels , it can not account for any high order channel - to - channel variations .",
    "therefore , in the current analysis we estimated the @xmath8 amplitudes of the high order variations across the spectral channels using the residuals that could not be removed with the quadratic polynomials from the scans of the calibrator stars .",
    "the calibrators used for @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per were @xmath10  cas  ( = hr  542 ) and @xmath5  cas  ( = hr  153 ) , respectively .",
    "both calibrators are b - type stars and were verified by spectroscopic observations to have h@xmath2 in absorption . after confirming that the channel - to - channel variations established based on observations of the calibrators are stable on time scales longer than one night , we calculated nightly averages that were then divided out of the scans of the target stars .",
    "after applying the bias and the calibration corrections to all scans , we extract the squared visibilities for the h@xmath2 channel forming two large data sets , one for @xmath0  cas  ( with 169 data points ) and the other for @xmath1  per  ( with 186 data points ) .",
    "the observations obtained on 2004  dec  2 , when the narrowband filters were not used , are treated as separate data sets .",
    "figures  [ fig : gamcas - uv ] and  [ fig : phiper - uv ] show the resulting ( @xmath11)-plane coverage at the ac ",
    "aw , and ae ",
    "w7 baselines in the h@xmath2 channel for @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 data for the two stars are shown in figures  [ fig : gamcas - all - data - fit ] and  [ fig : phiper - all - data - fit ] for observations obtained with the narrowband filter , whereas the @xmath8 observations obtained without the filters are shown in figures  [ fig : gamcas - no - filter ] and [ fig : phiper - no - filter ] .",
    "the interferometric observations obtained with the npoi do not contain enough spectral information to help us establish the properties of the h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "therefore , we observed @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per using a fiber - fed echelle spectrograph  ( also known as the solar - stellar spectrograph ; sss ) , which is located at the lowell observatory s john s.  hall 1.1  m telescope .",
    "the sss instrument produces spectra in the h@xmath2 region with the resolving power of @xmath310,000 and a signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) of few hundred in the h@xmath2 region .",
    "the sss observations were reduced using standard reduction routines written in idl  @xcite , and the resulting h@xmath2 profiles of @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per are shown in figures  [ fig : halpha_gcas ] and  [ fig : halpha_pper ] , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission of @xmath0  cas is known to be stable on time scales greater than @xmath12  yr and our spectra confirm this .",
    "the ews of the four h@xmath2 profiles shown in figure  [ fig : halpha_gcas ] range from @xmath13 to @xmath14  nm . because the largest uncertainty associated with these values is the precision of continuum normalization , which we estimate at 3% , for the purpose of our study we use an ew of @xmath15  nm for the h@xmath2 emission of @xmath0  cas .    as we will discuss in ",
    "[ sec : disk_truncation ] , @xmath1  per is a be+sdo spectroscopic binary with a period of 127  d and is known to show h@xmath2 variability .",
    "the observed variability is attributed in part to the radiative effects of the hot secondary on the circumstellar region associated with the primary .",
    "although our temporal coverage is limited , we confirm the presence of h@xmath2 emission variability in @xmath1  per .",
    "the equivalent widths of the three profiles shown in figure  [ fig : halpha_pper ] are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  nm , which were obtained on 2004  dec  3 , 2005  mar  3 , and 2005  apr  1 , respectively . however , because the relative shape of the h@xmath2 profile does not appear to change significantly , we conclude that combining all of the interferometric observations from our observing run should not result in any significant errors  ( we will return to this point in   [ sec : model_fitting ] ) . for this reason we adopt an h@xmath2 ew for @xmath1  per of @xmath19  nm , where the larger uncertainty should account for the intrinsic variability during our interferometric run .",
    "the squared visibilities from the spectral channels containing the h@xmath2 emission contain two signatures , one due to the central star and the other due to the circumstellar region .",
    "therefore , these data must be modeled with a two component model of the form @xmath20",
    "^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the visibility functions representing the photosphere of the central star and the circumstellar envelope , respectively , and @xmath23 is the fractional contribution from the stellar photosphere to the total flux in the h@xmath2 channel .",
    "generally , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be complex functions , but because the models we consider in this analysis are all point - symmetric , as well as concentric , the functions are real and can be treated as visibility amplitudes .    to decrease the number of free parameters in our models we treat the angular diameter of the central star as a known quantity .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the central stars are not significantly resolved even at our longest baseline .",
    "furthermore , as we discussed in @xcite , our best - fit models describing the h@xmath2-emitting regions are not very sensitive to the assumed diameter of the central star  ( changing the diameter by a factor of 2 results in @xmath3  1  % change in the best - fit disk parameters ) . for the same reason we can also ignore any effects related to the rapid rotation for which be stars",
    "are well known for , because the geometrical distortion and gravity darkening near the stellar equator will only weakly affect our best - fit disk parameters .",
    "the most widely used approach for predicting a stellar angular diameter is to use empirically established relationships between the stellar color index and the surface brightness , which in turn is related to the angular size  @xcite .",
    "another approach would be to use tabulations of linear stellar diameters as a function of spectral class  @xcite .",
    "however , because there is an intrinsic scatter in stellar diameters at each spectral class , and the distance to the source needs to be known to convert the linear diameter to the angular size needed for interferometry , this is not the preferred approach . therefore ,",
    "for @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per we adopt the same stellar angular diameters as were used by @xcite , which were derived using the photometric relations of @xcite .",
    "the angular diameters we adopt for @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per are 0.56 and 0.39  mas , respectively .",
    "we model the stellar photosphere of each star with a circularly symmetric uniform disk brightness distribution .",
    "this ensures that the central star is modeled in exactly the same way , at the continuum channels during the calibration procedure  ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) and at the h@xmath2 channel via equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "therefore , we represent the visibility function of the photospheric component of an angular diameter @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a first - order bessel function and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the spatial frequencies , which are given by the east - west and south - north components of the projected baseline on the plane of the sky divided by wavelength  ( see  4.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for the definition of @xmath27-@xmath28 plane ) .",
    "our interferometric observations were obtained at high spatial frequencies  ( i.e. , at high spatial resolution ) , and therefore , we can compare different models of brightness distribution .",
    "previously published work on disk models of be stars has demonstrated that the thermal structure of the circumstellar disks can be quite complex  @xcite . however , for this first investigation with this new observational technique we choose to model our data with three simple models , uniform disk  ( ud ) , uniform ring  ( ur ) , and a gaussian distribution  ( gd ) . the visibility amplitudes for all three models can be written as @xmath29 & { \\rm ur}\\\\ \\exp [ - ( \\pi \\theta_{\\rm gd } s)^2 / 4\\ln 2 ]       & { \\rm gd } \\end{array } \\right . , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 correspond to the angular diameters of the ud and ur models , respectively , and @xmath32 corresponds to the full - width at half - maximum  ( fwhm ) of the gaussian model . because we allow all three models to have elliptical distribution on the sky , all of the above diameters describe the dimensions along the major axis .",
    "the other variables in equation  ( [ eqn : envelope ] ) are , @xmath10 that describes the inner diameter of the ring model along the major axis  ( in units of @xmath31 ) , and @xmath33 that is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the axial ratio and @xmath1 is the position angle  ( pa ; measured east from north ) of the major axis  ( when @xmath36 ) . for circularly symmetric structures  ( @xmath37 ) , equation  ( [ eqn : s ] ) reduces to a simple expression for a radial spatial frequency in the @xmath38-plane that is given by @xmath39 .      to obtain a best - fit for each of the three models",
    ", we used a nonlinear least - squares idl procedure based on the levenberg - marquardt method  @xcite .",
    "each model is represented by equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) , with the appropriate expression for the envelope component from equation  ( [ eqn : envelope ] ) , and a fixed visibility function for the photospheric component  ( eq .  [ [ eqn : star ] ] with a fixed stellar diameter @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , the ud and gd models have four free parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath40 , @xmath35 , and @xmath1 , whereas the ur model has @xmath10 as an extra parameter .",
    "table  [ tab : best_fit ] lists the best - fit values for the parameters for all three models along with the reduced @xmath41 values . by inspecting the reduced @xmath41 values in table  [ tab : best_fit ] for the three @xmath0  cas models ,",
    "it is evident that the ud and ur models can not represent the observations obtained at all three baselines .",
    "therefore , we have also fitted models to observations of @xmath0  cas from the shortest two baselines only , where all three models yield similar quality fits  ( these models are also listed in table  [ tab : best_fit ] ) . to check for any possible variations in the models that could be attributed to the temporal variability of our sources  ( especially in the case of @xmath1  per ) , we fitted models to various subsets of our large data set . although typically the uncertainties of the best - fit parameters are larger for models fitted to smaller data sets , all results were consistent with our solutions based on all observations .    to illustrate why the ud and ur models fail to represent the observations of @xmath0  cas obtained at all three baselines , in figure  [ fig : compare_modelsgc ] we plot the best - fit ud , ur , and gd models , which were only fitted to data from the shortest two baselines .",
    "each baseline provides data over a different spatial frequency range  ( because of different physical lengths ) and these ranges are marked with thick solid lines in figure  [ fig : compare_modelsgc ] .",
    "a small fraction of each range corresponds to an instant at which the projected baseline on the sky was oriented along the major axis for which these model curves were evaluated .",
    "the model curves demonstrate the inherent degeneracy present between the three models at low spatial frequencies  ( i.e. , at low spatial resolutions the three models look the same ) .",
    "however , the longest baseline provides data at high enough spatial frequencies so that the degeneracy between the three models is eliminated  ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : gamcas - all - data - fit ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the ud and ur models are inconsistent with the data obtained at the longest baseline  ( largest spatial frequencies ) , whereas the gd models fit the observations at all baselines .",
    "the observations of @xmath1  per are more challenging because the angular size of its circumstellar region is smaller than for @xmath0  cas , as well as the projected baselines on the plane of the sky are not oriented along its major axis .",
    "this results in interferometric observations that do not resolve the region sufficiently well to break the degeneracy between the different models .",
    "this is also the reason all three models for @xmath1  per listed in table  [ tab : best_fit ] yield the same @xmath42 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare_modelspp ] demonstrates the differences between the model curves based on the three best - fit models evaluated at three different projections .",
    "the three projections were chosen to correspond to the minor axis  ( that is 27% of the major axis ) , along a direction where the extent is 50% of the major axis , and along the major axis . because we do not have observations that resolve the major axis  ( recall fig .  [",
    "fig : phiper - all - data - fit ] ) , the spatial frequency ranges over which we have data are marked only on the curves that correspond to the minor axis and 50% of the major  ( marked with thick solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_modelspp ] ) . based on figure  [",
    "fig : compare_modelspp ] we conclude that in order to break the degeneracy between the models , either observations at higher spatial frequencies , or along the major axis , are required  ( as demonstrated in the case of @xmath0  cas ) .      for",
    "@xmath1  per we can not exclude the ud and ur models in favor of the gd model based on interferometric data alone , however , we can demonstrate that the gd model is the preferred solution .",
    "this is because the three models that fit the @xmath1  per data equally well , have different best - fit values for the @xmath23 parameter , which can be constrained by spectroscopy . for example , if the ew of the continuum flux from the star in the h@xmath2 channel is @xmath43  ( which has units of length ) and the ew of the net h@xmath2 emission is @xmath44 , then the fractional photospheric contribution in the absence of a narrowband filter  ( @xmath45 ) can be expressed as @xmath46 with the narrowband filter @xmath43 gets reduced to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fractional transmission in the h@xmath2 channel .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission gets reduced by the filter as well , but because the h@xmath2 emission lines have fwhm @xmath7 1 nm , which is less than the width of 2.8  nm of the narrowband region , we can approximate the transmission at the h@xmath2 line  ( @xmath49 ) by the peak transmission of 92  % of the narrowband region  ( recall fig .  [",
    "fig : filter ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath23 parameter for the case including the filter can be written as @xmath50 taking the ratio of equations  ( [ eqn : cp_star ] ) and  ( [ eqn : cp_filter ] ) allows us to obtain an expression for @xmath48 of the form @xmath51 which does not depend on @xmath43 or @xmath52 .",

    "* ) . the net h@xmath2 emission of @xmath55  nm for @xmath1  per results in @xmath23 of @xmath56 .",

    "we interpret this as an indication that the brightness distribution of the circumstellar disk of @xmath1  per is best represented by a gd model .",
    "it is interesting to note , if we follow the same reasoning for @xmath0  cas data from the shortest two baselines  ( where the degeneracy between the three models also exists ) we arrive at the same conclusion that the gd model is the preferred solution . for @xmath0  cas , based on its h@xmath2 ew of @xmath58  nm and an estimated component accounting for the absorption line of 0.26  nm",
    ", we estimate that @xmath59 , which again is closest to the value obtained for the gd model .",
    "we conclude that out of the three models we have considered in our analysis the gd model is the only model that fits @xmath0  cas observations and is the preferred model for @xmath1  per based on spectroscopic constraints .",
    "therefore , in table  [ tab : parameters ] we list our final best - fit parameters describing the circumstellar regions of @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per based on the gd model fits .",
    "the model squared visibilities calculated based on these models are shown with red solid lines in figures  [ fig : gamcas - all - data - fit ] and  [ fig : phiper - all - data - fit ] for @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per , respectively .",
    "because the number of published parameters describing the circumstellar regions of @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per is still very small , it is worthwhile to compare our results to those published in the literature .",
    "both , @xcite and @xcite fitted a gd model to their observations and therefore their model values can be compared directly with those listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "using observational data from the mark  iii interferometer @xcite obtained best - fit model parameters for @xmath0  cas of @xmath60  mas , @xmath61 , and pa of 19@xmath62 .",
    "@xcite reported results based on older npoi observations  ( with a maximum baseline of 37.5  m ) , which had @xmath63  mas , @xmath64 , and pa of 32@xmath65 .",
    "our new determination of the angular size of the major axis of @xmath66 , fully confirms the previous estimates .",
    "the apparent axial ratio of @xmath67 that we find for @xmath0  cas is smaller than the published values and this might be related to the fact that our interferometric observations cover much larger range of baseline projection angles on the plane of the sky  ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : gamcas - uv ] ) .",
    "our best - fit value for the pa of @xmath68 agrees with our previous estimate  @xcite , but differs from the pa reported by @xcite whose value was at right angle to the polarization vector they obtained from polarimetry .",
    "possible sources for this discrepancy could be the intrinsic variability of the polarization of the source  ( see for example table  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the residual effects associated with the removal of the interstellar polarization , or the effects of non - axisymmetric scattering surface  ( i.e. , only for axisymmetric sources can one expect the polarization vector to be _ exactly _ perpendicular to the plane of the disk ) .    for @xmath1  per , @xcite obtained model values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and pa of @xmath71 , but they point out that the value for @xmath35 might be an upper limit because their baselines were not long enough to resolve the minor axis .",
    "indeed , our results based on observations that utilize baselines that are more than twice as long than those used in their study yield a best - fit value of @xmath72 for the axial ratio . however , the angular size of the major axis of @xmath73 and pa of @xmath74 that we obtain in this study fully agree with their values .",
    "since @xmath1  per was not observed by any other interferometer than mark  iii , our results represent the first confirmation of the values reported by @xcite .",
    "our interferometric observations of the spatially resolved circumstellar regions , which show an apparent ellipticity , can be used to estimate the inclination and disk - opening angles .",
    "for example , if we assume that the circumstellar disk is circularly symmetric , we can obtain a lower limit on the inclination angle  ( @xmath75 ) using the observed axial ratio  ( @xmath35 ) using @xmath76 the minimum value corresponds to a geometrically thin disk , where the entire signature of the apparent ellipticity is interpreted as a projection effect in this case .",
    "similarly , if we assume that the geometry of the circumstellar region can be represented with a simple equatorial disk model with a half - opening angle @xmath77 and radius @xmath78  ( see for example fig .  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can then obtain an upper limit on @xmath77 using @xmath79 where the maximum value corresponds to a system viewed edge - on .    in table  [ tab : parameters ] we list the estimated limits on the inclination and half - opening angles for both @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per based on their best - fit values of @xmath35 obtained from the elliptical gaussian models .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath1  per the lower limit of @xmath80  74@xmath4 for @xmath75 is consistent with the 80@xmath4 to @xmath81 range originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "although @xcite did not describe the circumstellar region in terms of an opening angle , the disk thickness of 1.32.7  @xmath82 and the disk radius of 7.7  @xmath82 can be translated to a half - opening angle between 5 and 10@xmath4 , which again is consistent with our upper limit of @xmath83 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the upper limits we obtain for @xmath77 of @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per to the value of 15@xmath4 adopted by @xcite in their study of almost 60 be stars based on far - ir iras observations .",
    "@xcite estimated a number of different be stellar characteristics , such as the mass loss rate and the disk density , which had a dependence on @xmath77 .",
    "although the authors assumed an error of a factor of 1.5 in @xmath84 , our upper limit for the disk half - opening angle for @xmath1  per is half their adopted value . in the case of @xmath1  per , the mass loss rate derived by @xcite will be overestimated by at least a factor of two , or more if the source is not viewed edge - on .",
    "our upper limit on the half - opening angle of 17@xmath4 for @xmath0  cas is consistent with the value adopted by @xcite .",
    "however , based on the line profile classification scheme established by @xcite we can conclude that @xmath0  cas is not viewed edge - on and therefore its half - opening angle is most likely less than 17@xmath4 . in the case of the be star @xmath5  tau , for which the apparent ellipticity of the circumstellar region has also been detected  @xcite",
    ", one can conclude that @xmath85 .",
    "it is possible that other be stars also have small disk opening angles . to further test the generality of this hypothesis , future interferometric observations should concentrate on systems that are thought to be viewed at large inclination angles  ( for example using h@xmath2 profile classification of * ? ? ?",
    "we can also compare our interferometrically determined opening angles with those predicted by @xcite who has calculated the disk opening angles for a number of be stars based on the flux in the brackett continuum near 2.2  @xmath86 m using the simeca code  @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of the simeca model is that for a fixed disk density at the stellar photosphere , the opening angle is directly proportional to the continuum flux , so that a large flux in the @xmath87-band corresponds to a large opening angle .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained a value of 14@xmath4 for the full - opening angle of the disk of @xmath1  per , which agrees with our upper value of 16@xmath4 .",
    "however , our upper limit for the full - opening angle for @xmath0  cas is 34@xmath4 , which is significantly less than the 54@xmath4 obtained by @xcite for this star",
    ". this discrepancy may be due to the fact that @xcite might have used apparent and not absolute magnitudes to derive the disk - opening angles , in which case the values reported in that study should be reevaluated .",
    "@xcite showed that the h@xmath2-emitting region of the binary be star @xmath5  tau was well within the estimated roche lobe of the primary , which suggests that the disk is truncated .",
    "another example of a possible disk truncation was presented by  @xcite for @xmath2  ara , where the vlti operating in the @xmath88 band did not resolve any structure and therefore allowed the authors to put an upper limit on the extent of the circumstellar region . because this limit was smaller than the expected spatial extent based on the models that were fitted to the balmer emission lines ,",
    "the authors suggest that disk truncation by an unseen companion might be occurring .",
    "evidence is accumulating which suggests that @xmath0  cas is a member of a binary system .",
    "@xcite published the first orbital radial velocity curve for @xmath0  cas based on observations collected in the 628672  nm range from 1993 to 2000 .",
    "their analysis suggests that this star is the primary component of a spectroscopic binary with a period of @xmath89 days and an eccentricity of 0.26 .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite using high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the h@xmath2 line obtained over a similar time period .",
    "they report a periodic change of 205 days in this line , which they also attribute to the binary system .",
    "although @xcite concludes that the secondary could be either a hot compact object or a low luminosity late - type star , they estimate that the separation between the components at periastron could be between 250 and 300  @xmath90 . the distance to @xmath0",
    "cas is @xmath91  pc based on the _ hipparcos _ satellite measurements  @xcite , which places the separation between the components at 6.27.4  mas .",
    "our best - fit value for the fwhm of the major axis is @xmath92 and therefore the circumstellar disk is well within the orbit established by @xcite .",
    "however , because the binary parameters of @xmath0  cas are not well established this comparison is tentative .",
    "the binary nature of @xmath1  per is much better established since it was recognized as a binary in the early 1900 s  @xcite .",
    "@xcite documents the development in the understanding of @xmath1  per s binary nature over the succeeding decades , and suggests that a subdwarf o star is the secondary .",
    "@xcite detected the secondary in ultraviolet spectra obtained with the hubble space telescope and confirmed poeckert s prediction .",
    "per is now part of a group of four candidate be@xmath93sdo binaries , the others being hr 2142  @xcite , 59  cyg  @xcite , and fy  cma  @xcite .",
    "be@xmath93sdo binaries may result from a spin - up of the b star as a result of mass transfer from the progenitor of the evolved subdwarf companion .",
    "estimates of the orbital parameters of @xmath1  per are available in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the semi - major axes of these two orbital solutions range from approximately 230 to 310 r@xmath94 . using the _ hipparcos _ distance of 220@xmath95  pc for @xmath1  per  @xcite we expect an angular separation of 4.96.6 mas between the components of @xmath1  per .",
    "as we would expect , this separation is larger than the angular radius of any of the models of @xmath1  per listed in table  [ tab : best_fit ] .",
    "the radial extent of the gaussian model can be approximated with the fwhm measure of 3.12@xmath960.08  mas  ( 148@xmath9630  @xmath90 ) we obtain for @xmath1  per  ( i.e. , we are assuming that the radial extent is twice the half - width of the gaussian ) .",
    "this disk radius is very close to the 178204  @xmath90 roche radius of the primary obtained by @xcite .",
    "this is most likely another example of a h@xmath2-emitting region that is close in size to the actual extent of the circumstellar region , and this suggests that disk truncation is occurring in this system .",
    "we should note that in the case of @xmath1  per the presence of a truncated disk has been predicted .",
    "@xcite used the iras observations of @xmath1  per at 12 , 25 , and 60  @xmath86 m to measure the ir excess and constrained the density distribution of @xmath97 with @xmath98 for the disk model . because he obtained a value of @xmath99 for two other",
    "be stars , @xmath100  cen and @xmath101  oph , which also happens to correspond to a velocity law that has more gradual increase with distance  ( something that is predicted based on the h@xmath2 spectroscopy ) , he argued that a density distribution with @xmath99 might be more appropriate for @xmath1  per , which could be only satisfied if the disk model was truncated at @xmath102  ( or @xmath346  @xmath90 ) .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between our values for the size of the truncated disk might be related to the different wavelength regimes of our studies , as well as to the assumption made by @xcite that the system is viewed pole - on , whereas @xmath75 might be very close to 90@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite also predicted a second h@xmath2-emitting disk associated with the secondary component .",
    "although our @xmath8 data in the h@xmath2 channel does not have a very high snr , we do not detect any deviations from the elliptical gaussian model that would suggest a binary signature in the h@xmath2 signal .",
    "therefore , we are forced to conclude that if the secondary star does possess a h@xmath2 emitting disk it does not contribute significantly to the net h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "this is also consistent with the secondary s disk radius of 68  @xmath90 estimated by @xcite based on the peak separation of the he  ii emission line .",
    "assuming that the h@xmath2 emission is proportional to the area of the disk , as demonstrated by @xcite , we conclude that the h@xmath2 emission from the disk of the secondary will contribute less than @xmath31% to the total h@xmath2 flux .",
    "the direct detection of the secondary with the npoi is unlikely as @xcite report a brightness ratio of 0.15  ( or @xmath103 m of 2 ) at 164.7  nm .",
    "the npoi operates over a bandwidth of 550850  nm and at these wavelengths the magnitude difference between the two components is likely to be much larger than 2 .",
    "a search for a binary signature  ( a sinusoidal variation ) across the continuum channels in both @xmath0  cas and @xmath1  per yielded null results . on the other hand , a binary signature with a small @xmath8 amplitude  ( less than @xmath33  % )",
    "could not be ruled out .",
    "in fact , it might be possible to detect the signature of binarity in both stars at longer wavelengths since @xmath0  cas may be associated with a cool companion , and @xmath1  per might contain large contributions from the circumstellar disks of both components due to the free - free and free - bound emission .",
    "we have successfully demonstrated the use of a narrowband filter in the npoi to increase the contrast between the h@xmath2-emitting material and the central star .",
    "our observations of two be stars , @xmath0 cas and @xmath1 per , and our subsequent analysis have yielded the following results :    1 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the uniform disk or ring - like models are inconsistent with the observations of the circumstellar region of @xmath0  cas , whereas a gaussian model is fully consistent with the data .",
    "however , since the thermal structure of the circumstellar disks of be stars can be quite complex , as suggested by recent models  @xcite , it might turn out that a more complicated brightness distributions may be required to fully describe these regions .",
    "2 .   the circumstellar disk of @xmath0  cas appears to be consistent with the orbital parameters published in the literature .",
    "however , higher precision binary solutions are required to test for the possible disk truncation by the secondary .",
    "3 .   based on interferometric and spectroscopic data",
    "we have shown that the brightness distribution of the h@xmath2-emitting circumstellar region of @xmath1  per is best represented by a gaussian distribution .",
    "4 .   our analysis supports the earlier prediction by @xcite that the disk of @xmath1  per is truncated due to the presence of an orbiting companion .",
    "however , the disk size we report is different than the value determined by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to different wavelength regimes used in each study and/or due to the low inclination angle assumed by @xcite for this star , whereas we obtain @xmath104 .",
    "a natural extension of the analysis presented in this study is the direct comparison of interferometric data with theoretically predicted interferometric observables , such as synthetic squared visibilities .",
    "future observations and modeling are planned that combine narrowband interferometry with spectroscopy for several other be stars , especially those that possess weak h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the goal of this work is to place greater constraints on the spatial extent and physical properties of the circumstellar material .",
    "these constraints will allow various dynamical models to be tested with greater certainty .",
