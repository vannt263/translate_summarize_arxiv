    "low scale supersymmetry , augmented by an unbroken @xmath9 matter ( r- ) parity , largely overcomes the gauge hierarchy problem encountered in the standard model ( sm ) and also provides a compelling cold dark matter candidate . in the msugra / constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( cmssm )  @xcite , as well as in many other realistic models , the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) is stable  @xcite with a relic density that is compatible with the wmap dark matter measurements  @xcite . to be compatible with the latter , and assuming thermal relic abundance",
    ", a pure higgsino or wino lsp mass should be around a tev or so  @xcite , which is about an order of magnitude larger than the most sensitive discovery region ( @xmath10 gev ) of the ongoing direct detection experiments .",
    "on the other hand , the small annihilation cross section of a pure bino lsp with mass of around 100 gev does not permit one to easily reproduce the required relic dark matter abundance  @xcite .",
    "a variety of scenarios that enhance the bino annihilation cross section have been proposed .",
    "for instance , the lsp could be a suitable bino - higgsino admixture with mass @xmath10 gev and compatible wmap relic density  @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "a somewhat different and well studied option is co - annihilation , which is realized in the cmssm as bino - stau or bino - stop co - annihilation  @xcite . in this case",
    "the bino and the relevant nlsp ( where nlsp stands for next to lightest supersymmetric particle ) sfermion are sufficiently close together in mass , such that the ensuing co - annihilation processes in the early universe allow one to reproduce the desired bino relic density .",
    "another interesting scenario of this kind is bino - gluino co - annihilation .",
    "this scenario is not possible in the cmssm , but it has been implemented in models with non - universal gaugino masses  @xcite , and a class of ( third family ) yukawa unified models  @xcite .",
    "the collider signatures of these three ( stop , stau , gluino ) co - annihilation scenarios have been discussed in the literature  @xcite and references therein .",
    "a somewhat less well studied region of the mssm parameter space is the so - called sbottom co - annihilation ( or nlsp sbottom ) scenario .",
    "this was proposed in the context of supersymmetric @xmath11 with @xmath12 unification and non - universal supersymmetry breaking scalar @xmath13 terms for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 matter multiplets  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the nlsp sbottom scenario was re - considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated by studies related to the international linear collider ( ilc ) . yet another suggestion , put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to employ non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "be that as it may , in our study we do not specify any particular theoretical models to explore the sbottom - bino co - annihilation scenario .",
    "a satisfactory implementation of the nlsp sbottom scenario with the correct wmap compatible lsp relic density requires a relatively small mass difference , less than or of order 20% , between the sbottom and the bino  @xcite .",
    "the sbottom decay into @xmath16-jet , @xmath17 , then becomes the unique channel if the mass difference is larger than @xmath16 quark mass and suggests a search for nlsp sbottom via @xmath18 this search was performed with the first run ii data in the d0 experiment , but at that time the @xmath16-tagging techniques were not available .",
    "other groups have studied the detection possibility at the tevatron  @xcite and ilc  @xcite but , to the best of our knowledge , the analysis for lhc is still lacking .",
    "the di-@xmath16 jet events is also the leading search channel for the sm - like higgs boson , but the identification criteria is different .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we study , without relying on any specific nlsp sbottom model , the collider phenomenology of this scenario .",
    "we discuss here the signal properties and the relevant backgrounds .",
    "the nlsp sbottom discovery limits at the 7 and 14 tev lhc are discussed in section iii , and our conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "with the requirement that @xmath19 the nlsp sbottom essentially decays into a bottom quark and lsp @xmath20 , and consequently the relevant kinematic constraint is @xmath21 if this two - body decay is allowed . together with the requirement of sbottom - bino co - annihilation",
    ", we have the following @xmath4 region for a given sbottom mass : @xmath22 we discuss below the discovery potential of nlsp sbottom and lsp @xmath20 at the lhc with the mass boundary in eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) .",
    "the current bound on the sbottom mass comes from lep ii , namely @xmath23 gev  @xcite .",
    "the pair production rate of sbottom with @xmath24 gev mass is around the pico - barn level . for nlsp sbottom ,",
    "we focus on the sbottom pair production followed by the unique two - body decay @xmath17 .",
    "namely , @xmath25 induced by gluon fusion and @xmath26 annihilation processes . in principle , there also exist same sign sbottom pair productions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "they arise from third generation parton scattering with @xmath29-channel neutralino exchange . due to the smallness of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of third generation sea quarks at large @xmath30 collision energy",
    ", we ignore this contribution in our study .",
    "therefore , the sbottom production and subsequent decay only depend on the two mass parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ sbottom ] we show the total cross section of sbottom pair production at the 7 tev ( dashed ) and 14 tev ( solid ) lhc .",
    "the decays , on average , of the relatively long lived @xmath31-mesons in the final states take place @xmath32(mm ) away from the primary interaction vertex . with the detection at the so - called secondary vertex",
    ", tagging jets with decaying @xmath31-mesons significantly reduces the qcd jet background .",
    "the @xmath16-jet production in the sm is mainly due to gluon splitting , and so the @xmath16-jets always arise as pairs .",
    "we therefore propose to tag two @xmath16-jets both in the signal and background events , and the sm @xmath2 production would become the leading irreducible background . besides the @xmath16 quark , the dark matter particles @xmath20 also appear in sbottom decays .",
    "the missing transverse energy @xmath33 is another characteristic feature of the signal .",
    "the irreducible sm background for @xmath33 is from @xmath34 production , with the branching fraction of @xmath34 invisible decay @xmath35 of 20% .",
    "the other source of @xmath16-jet production in the sm is from top quark decay originating from top pair production .",
    "it can mimic our signal if both @xmath36 s decay leptonically and the charged leptons are not detected , which is assumed to occur if the leptons are too soft with transverse momentum @xmath37 gev and are not in central range with pseudo - rapidity @xmath38 .",
    "there also exist reducible backgrounds due to other jets being mis - identified as @xmath16-jets .",
    "the sm backgrounds we consider in our study are then @xmath39    we generate the sm background events with madgraph / madevent  @xcite and pass them into pythia  @xcite for parton shower and hadronization . due to the uncertainty of mis - measurement in jet energy or momentum in the detector , the @xmath2 events without @xmath34 can also induce missing energy . the pythia output",
    "is then fed into the fast detector simulation pgs-4  @xcite , in order to simulate the important detector effects .",
    "the @xmath16-tagging efficiency and mis - tagging rate in pgs-4 are based on the technical design reports of atlas and cms , and we use the default values in our analysis .",
    "the following basic kinematical cuts on the transverse momentum ( @xmath40 ) , the pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath41 ) , and the separation in the azimuthal angle - pseudo rapidity plane ( @xmath42 ) between two jets have been employed for jet selection  @xcite : p^j_t > 15  gev , |_j| < 2.0  , r_jj>0.4 .",
    "[ basic ]    for the susy signal we also use pythia to generate events and then forward to pgs-4 to smear the observed particles as well .",
    "the hardness of the @xmath16-jet in final states depends on the mass difference @xmath43 .",
    "the larger the @xmath44 we impose , the harder the @xmath16-jet is , as also the missing transverse energy @xmath33 , in which case more events would pass the selection cuts .",
    "the @xmath33 is reconstructed according to the smeared @xmath16-jets . in fig .",
    "[ met ] we show the @xmath33 distribution of the signal and backgrounds including basic cuts in eq .",

    "one can see that the @xmath33 of backgrounds is rather soft because the dominant background source is pure @xmath2 , and its missing energy is just from small uncertainty of @xmath16-jets mis - measurement .",
    "we find that by requiring a significant @xmath33 cut , namely @xmath45 the sm backgrounds can be significantly suppressed .",
    "however , @xmath2 is still the leading background and one order of magnitude larger than our signal because of its extremely large size to begin with . to further suppress the contribution from processes where the missing energy comes from jet energy mis - measurement , we require that @xmath33 is not parallel to any @xmath16-jets in events  @xcite , namely @xmath46 furthermore",
    ", the @xmath2 events are expected to be back - to - back , and thus peaked at small transverse sphericity @xmath47 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ st ] . around @xmath48 ,",
    "the behavior of backgrounds reaches a level two orders of magnitude lower than the peak value .",
    "we thus require  @xcite @xmath49 to reject @xmath2 events .",
    "after these selection cuts , the sm @xmath2 background can be completely eliminated .",

    "the total production cross section for @xmath65 is about 7 fb at the 14 tev lhc , with approximately 27% branching ratio of gluino decay into @xmath66",
    ". the @xmath16-jet and nlsp sbottom will be highly boosted , and the signal from heavy gluino decays will consequently be two extremely hard jets with one of them being the collimated sbottom . however , if we require the two energetic @xmath16-jets to be identified , the production rate will be further suppressed because the @xmath16-jet tagging efficiency declines as its @xmath40 increases , with @xmath67 gev in this case .",
