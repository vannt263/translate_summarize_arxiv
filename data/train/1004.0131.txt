    "pulsars , magnetic oblate spheriods of nuclear densities @xmath3 kilometers in diameter , have been found rotating at speeds of up to almost one thousand times a second ( hessels et al . 2006 ; see also galloway 2008 ) in some of the most exotic settings in the known universe .",
    "for example , some pulsars are found within x - ray binaries ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2007 ) and others with compact object companions in close binaries ( hulse & taylor 1975 ) thought to be emitting gravitational radiation ( see landau & lifshitz 1951 ; paczyski 1967 ; clark & eardley 1977 ) .",
    "recently , the number of known binary pulsars has been rapidly increasing ( lorimer et al . 2006a ; galloway et al . 2008 ) .",
    "there are now in excess of @xmath4 galactic disk binary pulsars .",
    "this includes rotation powered pulsars ( radio pulsars : atnf pulsar catalogue manchester , hobbs , teoh & hobbs 2005 ) and accretion powered pulsars ( x - ray binary pulsars : liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2007 ; galloway 2008 ; galloway et al .",
    "more than @xmath5 of these are accreting from a range of stellar masses and companion types ( galloway 2008 ) , @xmath6 are thought to orbit another neutron star ( van den heuvel 2007 ; stairs 2008 ) , while others ( @xmath7 ) dwell in detached systems with white dwarfs companions ( atnf pulsar catalogue , manchester et al . 2005 ) and possibly main sequence ( ms ) companions ( champion et al . 2008 ) . from observations of pulsars in such systems",
    "it is possible to constrain computational modelling of binary evolutionary phases that are general to many non - pulsar related systems including , but not limited to , tidal evolution , roche - lobe overflow and common envelope ( ce ) evolution .",
    "it is the most rapidly rotating pulsars that best constrain uncertainties in the theory related to these processes .",
    "such work has been attempted in kiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kiel & hurley ( 2009 : kh09 ) , where models of the complete galactic pulsar population have been made . however , we note that these models are yet to include selection effects which are critical when interpreting the results of pulsar surveys ( taylor & manchester 1977 ; oslowski et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "short gamma - ray bursts provide an alternative method to study the physics of compact stars . here",
    "compact stars are considered to be the most compact of remnants : neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "we define a double compact binary ( dcb ) to be any combination of these compact objects within a binary system ( without any limit on the orbital period ) and close dcbs are those systems with orbital periods of less than a few days .",
    "the dcbs that merge within the assumed @xmath8gyr age of the galaxy ( i.e. during our simulations ) are defined as coalescing dcbs .",
    "it is postulated that gamma - ray emission is produced during the coalescence of these systems and that radiation of gravitational waves occurs during the preceding in - spiral phase ( clark & eardley 1977 ) . in particular it is thought that short gamma - ray bursts are produced by coalescing double neutron star systems ( paczynski 1986 ) .",
    "gamma - ray burst observations are very interesting in themselves , however , dcb systems offer other observational features of importance . not only can many tests of general relativity be performed but they offer insights into a host of observable phenomena ( e.g. taylor , fowler & mcculloch 1979 ; lyne et al .",
    "the formation of close dcbs requires two stars of sufficient mass to interact gravitationally , triggering mechanisms to decrease the separation between them during their stellar lifetimes .",
    "what seems to be the most important binary evolutionary mechanism in forming close dcbs is the common - envelope phase ( paczyski 1976 ) where the evolution following the first supernova ( sn ) generally requires at least one such event .",
    "the modelling of the ce phase is associated with much uncertainty ( see , for example , dewi , podsiadlowski & sena 2006 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2007a ) and will be discussed further in the following section .",
    "interestingly , voss & tauris ( 2003 ) found that @xmath9 of bh - ns dcb systems can be formed via the direct - sn mechanism ( kalogera 1998 ) and therefore a ce phase is not required in all cases . adding further uncertainty to the mix brown ( 1995 ) suggested that unless the initial mass ratio is very close to unity nss spiraling - in within a ce should always accrete enough matter to collapse and form bhs .",
    "this work examines population characteristics of dcbs , including predictions of double neutron star ( ns - ns ) distributions and correlations between orbital properties and location .",
    "the results are extended to detail both long and short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their progenitors , modelling tidally enhanced collapsars and coalescing dcbs . in particular , projected distances from the host galaxy of model grbs are compared to observations .",
    "no detailed conclusions from direct comparison to observations are attempted , as in belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) who account for redshift and different galaxy masses . nor",
    "do we consider the evolution of systems in globular clusters ( see e.g. ivanova et al .",
    "2008 ; sadowski et al .",
    "section  [ s : bpbk ] briefly outlines the population synthesis tool used in this body of work .",
    "the results are spread over sections  [ s : dcbns - ns ] , [ s : coal ] and [ s : grb ] , which examine the bound dcb and ns - ns populations ( even if they go on to eventually coalesce ) , coalescing dcb populations and grb populations , respectively .",
    "the following work utilizes theoretical studies into ns binary and stellar evolution ( kiel et al . 2008 ) and galactic kinematics ( kh09 ) .",
    "the modelling of stellar and binary evolution is performed by binpop , a monte - carlo population synthesis scheme that incorporates the detailed binary stellar evolution ( bse ) code , developed by hurley , tout & pols ( 2002 ) and updated in kiel et al .",
    "bse facilitates modelling of the latest theoretical stellar and binary evolution prescriptions such as : tides , stellar composition , magnetic braking , gravitational radiation , mass accretion over a range of timescales and realistic angular mometum evolution of pulsar systems .",
    "all of which are important evolutionary features when modelling populations of dcbs .",
    "an aspect of binary evolution crucial to the formation and characteristics of close dcbs is common - envelope evolution ( paczyski 1976 ; webbink 1984 ; iben & livio 1993 ) .",
    "the treatment of ce evolution within binpop / bse has previously been described in detail ( hurley , tout & pols 2002 ; kiel & hurley 2006 ) . however , considering the potential influence of this phase on the outcomes of close binary population synthesis we also give an overview here so as to assist the reader in the interpretation of our results , noting that a full investigation of how uncertainties involved in modeling this phase affect the properties of the dcb populations will be left to future work .",
    "a ce phase is assumed to be initiated if a giant star ( with a sizeable convective envelope ) fills its roche - lobe and the ensuing mass - transfer is calculated to occur on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the envelope of the giant then rapidly expands and envelops both the companion star and the degenerate core of the giant , thus forming a ce .",
    "as suggested by paczyski ( 1976 ) , the companion star and giant core will then spiral towards each other while transferring orbital energy to the envelope via dynamical friction .",
    "the eventual outcome of this process is essentially determined by a race between the spiral - in and the removal of the envelope owing to the energy transfer : if the companion and the giant core come into contact first then a merger results , otherwise the result is a close binary composed of the former core ( now a remnant star ) and the companion .",
    "although some detailed hydrodynamic models of this process have been attempted ( bodenheimer & taam 1984 ; taam & sandquist 2000 ; ricker & taam 2008 ) the treatment within population synthesis codes remains simplistic as a detailed theory is lacking .",
    "in binpop / bse modelling of the ce phase is summed up by the equation : @xmath10 which describes the energy balance between the binding energy of the envelope and change in orbital energy .",
    "these are related by an efficiency parameter , @xmath11 , which encapsulates the uncertainty of the model within what is known as the @xmath12-formalism ( nelemans & tout 2005 ) .",
    "also included in the calculation are the mass of the giant star , @xmath13 , the mass of the giant core @xmath14 , the mass of the companion , @xmath15 , the gravitational constant , @xmath16 , the structure constant of the giant , @xmath17 , the radius of the giant , @xmath18 , and the initial and final orbital separation , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as documented in hurley , tout & pols ( 2002 ) and kiel & hurley ( 2006 ) , this is roughly the equivalent of using @xmath21 in the alternative formulation given by iben & livio ( 1993 : where we have taken the liberty of using @xmath22 to distinguish between the two methods ) and thus corresponds to efficient transfer of energy within the ce .",
    "kiel & hurley ( 2006 ) found that using @xmath23 aided comparison of the relative ns - low - mass x - ray binary and bh - low - mass x - ray binary formation rates to observations .",
    "previous use of @xmath24 produced a dearth of bh - low - mass x - ray binaries compared to ns - low - mass x - ray binaries .    within the @xmath12-formalism the greater the value of @xmath11",
    "the more efficient the spiral in process is at driving away the envelope .",
    "values greater than unity may suggest an energy source other than gravitational potential energy is also important in driving off the envelope .",
    "the effect of the assumed value of @xmath11 ( or @xmath22 ) on the results of binary population synthesis have been documented previously ( e.g. tutukov & yungleson 1996 ; belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 ; hurley , tout & pols 2002 ; voss & tauris 2003 ; kiel & hurley 2006 ) .",
    "a large @xmath11 prescription is also equivalent to a large value of @xmath17  a diffuse stellar envelope . in the past",
    "there have been three methods of accounting for the structure of the giant donor star with @xmath17 ( see voss & tauris 2003 for a similar discussion on this point ) .",
    "one method is to include it with the ce efficiency and to simply vary a combined @xmath25 parameter ( e.g. belczynski et al .",
    "2002a , b ; nelemans & tout 2005 ; pfahl , podsiadlowski & rappaport 2005 ; belczynski et al .",
    "another method is to assume a constant value of @xmath17 ( with @xmath26 typically used ) separate to the assumed @xmath11 value ( numerically consistent with the previous method : portegies zwart & yungleson 1998 ; hurley , tout & pols 2002 ; dewi , podsiadlowski & sena 2006 ; kiel & hurley 2006 ) .",
    "the final method is to include an algorithm which provides varying values of @xmath17 depending upon ( see tauris & dewi 2001 ) the mass ( core and envelope ) and stellar evolutionary phase of the donor star ( e.g. voss & tauris 2003 ; podsiadlowski , rappaport , han 2003 ; kiel & hurley 2006 ) .",
    "tauris & dewi ( 2001 ) show that @xmath17 values may range between @xmath27 ( the average for massive stars being @xmath28 : dewi & tauris 2001 ; dewi , podsiadlowski & sena 2006 ) . in this body of work",
    "we use a variable @xmath17 that ranges from @xmath29 depending upon the donor type and we assume @xmath11 to be either @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "another feature of the ce phase which has been shown to clearly affect the resultant populations of double compact binaries is the possibility that ce initiated by stars on the hertzsprung gap ( hg ) always leads to coalescence ( belczynski et al .",
    "2007a ) . following this assumption belczynski et al .",
    "( 2007a ) found that the merger rate of bh - bh binaries decreased by @xmath32 orders of magnitude compared to models without such a restriction .",
    "this concept is based on the study of ivanova & taam ( 2003 ) who , in agreement with the suggestion of podsiadlowski , rappaport & han ( 2003 ) found that all their detailed models in which a hg star initiates ce resulted in coalescence of the two cores . at this stage",
    "we do not impose such an outcome explicitly .",
    "however , the possibility of coalescence is increased by the use of a varying @xmath17 during ce . here",
    "the value of @xmath17 may drop to as low as @xmath33 during the hg phase ( e.g. podsiadlowski , rappaport & han 2003 ) accounting for the lack of a convective envelope especially for those stars near the hayashi track .    during the rapid and explosive formation of compact objects impulsive asymmetric mass - loss can lead to the transmission of momentum to the central compact object . to model this transfer of momentum",
    "we assume an instantaneous sn velocity kick for nss in the form of a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion of @xmath34 ( see kiel et al .",
    "2008 ) . for bh systems there are difficulties in statistically determining a realistic description for the sn kick magnitudes of the population .",
    "the magnitude of stellar bh velocity kicks is believed to vary between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( e.g. jonker & nelemans 2004 ; willems et al . 2005 ) . to account for this uncertainty",
    "we produce models where bhs receive no kicks or where bh kicks are drawn from a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion of @xmath34 .",
    "we also can include electron capture sn ( ec sn ; miyaji et al .",
    "1980 ) events in our models .",
    "the capture of electrons onto primarily magnesium atoms within an oxygen - neon - magnesium core depletes the core of electron pressure resulting in the collapse and supernova explosion .",
    "the details of our ec sn model are found in kiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and here we provide models with and without this assumption . during ec sne the sn kick is taken from a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion assumed to be @xmath37 ( typical values range anywhere from @xmath38 ) .",
    "the lower dispersion value arises because of the lower energy yield of ec sne as compared to typical sne .",
    "modelling of stellar and binary kinematic evolution within a galaxy is completed using binkin .",
    "this code , developed in kh09 , solves four coupled equations of motion to evolve forward in time the galactic positions of systems of interest .",
    "binkin uses a recipe for the galactic gravitational potential structure , initial birth positions , initial system velocities and output from binpop to calculate the kinematic details for a population of stellar systems within a galaxy .",
    "the particular output from binpop of interest for binkin is information on sn recoil velocities ( time , direction and magnitude ) and the birth time of each system within the galaxy ( randomly selected from a flat distribution between @xmath39gyr ) .",
    "previously , both binpop ( kiel et al .",
    "2008 ) and binkin ( kh09 ) were used to examine pulsar systems exclusively .",
    "dcb and grb systems , on the other hand , have not been considered directly or in such detail by us until now .",
    "we outline the modelling of grbs systems below and consider their population characteristics in section  [ s : grb ] .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are found to occur on two timescales .",
    "there are long grbs ( lgrbs ) , where the observed bursting event occurs over timescales of typically @xmath5s , and short grbs ( sgrbs ) , with a median burst duration of @xmath40s ( woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "the majority of population synthesis works have examined the evolution of what is believed to be sgrb progenitors  coalescing dcb systems ( portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 ; bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1999 ; hurley , tout & pols 2002 ; belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 ; voss & tauris 2003 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ; sadowski et al . 2008 ) and similarly paczyski ( 1990 ) modelled grbs taking their locations as those of an old ns population .",
    "at present it is believed that lgrbs are formed during core - collapse type ibc supernovae ( sne ) of massive stars whose cores at the time of explosion are rapidly rotating ( woosley 1993 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ; termed as the ` collapsar ' model by macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "models suggest that the fall back accretion disks of sne are more energetic and have longer timescales than models of double compact coalescence ( woosley 1993 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "this leads to a longer grb event for the former .",
    "some alternative models of progenitor sgrbs are outlined in the review of nakar ( 2007 ; and references within ) .",
    "these models include accretion induced collapse of nss into bhs , type ia sne , magnetar giant flares and phase conversion from nss to quark or hyper - stars .",
    "recently , realistic population synthesis models of grbs have examined the formation and evolution of lgrbs produced from population ii progenitors ( see bogomazov , lipunov & tutukov 2008 and detmers , langer , podsiadlowski & izzard 2008 ) and population iii progenitors ( belczynski et al .",
    "it has been shown that magnetic fields extract angular momentum from wolf - rayet ( lgrb progenitor ) cores , slowing the spin of the core below the rate required by grb theory ( petrovic , langer , yoon & heger 2005 ; woosley 1993 ) .",
    "detailed modelling can produce rapidly rotating wolf - rayet cores at collapse if the initial stellar metallicity is reduced below solar quantities ( yoon , langer & norman 2006 ) .",
    "however , in terms of population synthesis both bogomazov , lipunov & tutukov ( 2008 ) and detmers et al .",
    "( 2008 ) assumed that the formation of lgrbs must have occurred within a binary system . here",
    "a companion star can exert a tidal influence on the wolf - rayet core , keeping the system tidally locked until the sn and formation of lgrb and black hole .",
    "bogomazov , lipunov & tutukov ( 2008 ) examined in some detail the effect modifying the metallicity and wind mass loss had on the formation of lgrbs , in line with the detailed models of yoon , langer & norman ( 2006 ) .",
    "detmers et al .",
    "( 2008 ) investigated , via detailed stellar models , whether the effect of tides in close binary systems at solar metallicities can spin up a wolf - rayet star sufficiently enough to form a collapsar - lgrb .",
    "although detmers et al .",
    "( 2008 ) produced collapsar systems they found it could only arise from those systems that had some mass transfer and/or merger event during their lifetimes .",
    "detmers et al .",
    "( 2008 ) then perform a population synthesis study to compare their model birthrate to observations .",
    "they found that the tidally spun - up collapsar model could only produce a small fraction of the lgrb formation rate , however , carbon - oxygen and/or helium star mergers with bhs occur more readily and could possibly form some fraction of grb systems .    for our lgrb models we follow the method of detmers et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which requires a system that contains a carbon - oxygen star to be tidally influenced by a bh .",
    "the rapidly rotating ( tidally locked ) carbon - oxygen star then goes on to form a bh and in the process a lgrb .",
    "it is not relevant if the resultant bh - bh system becomes disassociated .",
    "we consider a binary system to be tidally locked when the ratio of carbon - oxygen star radius to the orbital separation is greater than @xmath41 ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is on dcb and grb systems produced in population synthesis models . to compare with our previous pulsar population synthesis work we provide analysis of model c@xmath42 from kh09 .",
    "this model was introduced briefly in kh09 but is used in detail here .",
    "it involves the evolution of @xmath43 binary systems which is two orders of magnitude greater than the main suite of models presented in kh09 .",
    "model c@xmath42 incorporates the favoured binary evolutionary model of kiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , model fd , and the favoured kinematics of kh09 .",
    "details for the model can be found in table 1 of kiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and table 1 of kh09 . for clarity",
    "we show the full set of possible parameters in binpop and binkin within table  [ t : binpopbinkin ] along with their values for model c@xmath42 . to address some possible deficiencies of model c@xmath42",
    "we also examine the resultant dcb and grb populations of an additional set of models that include different evolutionary assumptions .",
    "the model changes include assuming : ( i ) @xmath24 ; ( ii ) bhs receive velocity kicks at birth ( from the same sn kick distribution as nss ) ; and , ( iii ) bhs receive kicks _ and _ nss may form via ec sn . including these effects allow us to determine the extent by which such assumptions affect the final model dcb and lgrb populations .",
    "the initial number of binary systems in these additional models is @xmath44 , an order of magnitude less than in model c@xmath42 .",
    "as shown in kh09 this decrease in model initial binary number still provides statistical significant results for binary evolution and galactic kinematics , while being preferable for computational efficiency . in our models",
    "we define the galactic region of interest to include all stars with @xmath45kpc and @xmath46kpc .",
    "we note that when discussing dcb systems the order of compact star formation is depicted by the placement within the system name . for example",
    "the ns is created first in a ns - bh binary ( i.e. before any sn the initially more massive star transfers much of its mass to the initially less massive star facilitating ns formation prior to bh formation ) .    [ cols=\"^,<,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tables  [ t : tableformrates ] and  [ t : tablemergerates ] we show the formation and merger rates respectively for the four dcb system types in our models . to calculate the rates we first count the fraction of stars in the model that led to a type ii supernova , combine this with the assumption that the fraction of binaries in the galaxy is 0.5 , and normalize this to the empirical galactic type ii sne rate ( @xmath47 : cappellaro , evans & turatto 1999 ) .",
    "the relative numbers of the dcb systems and mergers are then calibrated against this to produce the rates .",
    "this method of calculation is commonly employed in binary population synthesis ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2002 ; belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 ; voss & tauris 2003 ; pfahl et al .",
    "2005 , for example ) so facilitates easy comparison with previous work .",
    "an alternative method uses the galactic star formation rate ( e.g. kiel & hurley 2006 ) . with either method the uncertainties involved in the calibration",
    "make it more appropriate to discuss relative rather than absolute rates .",
    "this is also true of the uncertainties in rates owing to variations in the parameters of binary evolution models .",
    "these uncertainties have been well documented in the past .",
    "for example , belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) find ns - ns merger rates in the range @xmath31@xmath48myr@xmath1 as a result of a comprehensive exploration of the available parameter space . while oshaughnessy et al .",
    "( 2005b ) favor models with ns - ns merger rates within the range @xmath49@xmath50myr@xmath1 , although the total model range of merger rates extends far beyond these limits .",
    "conversely , we find that rates quoted for a particular model ( with a set choice of parameter values ) vary by only a few percent at most with repeated realisations using distinct random number distributions ( as was also found by belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 ) .",
    "we note that in calculating our rates we have assumed an age of @xmath51gyr for the galaxy . if we instead take an age of @xmath52gyr the quoted rates increase by less than 10% .",
    "we quote rates for our model c@xmath42  with parameter values and distribution functions as listed in table  [ t : binpopbinkin ]  and a set of comparison models in which we alter the common - envelope efficiency parameter , the treatment of bh velocity kicks , and the possibility of ns formation via electron - capture sne .",
    "a number of trends are immediately evident from tables  [ t : tableformrates ] and  [ t : tablemergerates ] : ( i ) decreasing @xmath11 can reduce the rates by as much as an order of magnitude ; ( ii ) without kicks for bhs the bh - bh rates are very high ; and , ( iii ) the inclusion of ec sne leads to a sharp increase in the ns - ns rates . looking first at the ns - ns systems the merger rates of all models",
    "are in agreement with the empirical estimates of @xmath31@xmath53myr@xmath1 made recently by kim , kalogera & lorimer ( 2006 ) .",
    "they are also in agreement with the ranges found in the binary population synthesis works of belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) and oshaughnessy et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , as is the noted behaviour of rates with variations in @xmath11 .",
    "the ns - ns merger rate found by belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) in their standard model was @xmath54myr@xmath1 which is higher than in our model c@xmath42 which has a rate of @xmath55myr@xmath1 .",
    "belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) used @xmath56 in their standard model which , assuming @xmath57 , means @xmath58 and consequently a more efficient ce process than in model c@xmath42 ( which effectively uses @xmath59 : see section  2 ) .",
    "thus the difference is consistent with the expected trend in ce efficiency but there are numerous more subtle differences between the models which could also play a role .",
    "a noticeable outcome of our models is the high formation and merger rates for bh - bh binaries predicted by model c@xmath42 , which are above previous predictions in the literature ( e.g. lipunov et al 1997 ; portegies zwart & yungleson 1998 ; voss & tauris 2003 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2007a ) , in some cases by more than an order of magnitude . following the methodology of belczynski et al .",
    "( 2007a ) the bh - bh merger rate of model c@xmath42 , given in table  [ t : tablemergerates ] , sets a detection rate for the current ligo gravitational wave detector at approximately @xmath60 .",
    "ligo has been running in detection mode for longer than this without a detection and therefore the model c@xmath42 rate is inconsistent and thus an over - estimate .",
    "reducing the efficiency of the ce spiral - in process halves the predicted bh - bh merger rate which is a step in the right direction . a further reduction result from the introduction of bh velocity kicks . in our model",
    "where bhs are given velocity kicks from the same distribution as for nss ( maxwellian distribution with dispersion of @xmath61 km s@xmath1 ) the bh - bh formation and merger rates decrease to @xmath62myr@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we now find that the merger rate of ns - ns systems is larger than for bh - bh systems in agreement with the majority of previous works ( other than voss & tauris 2003 ) .",
    "this is further accentuated with the inclusion of ec sne which increases the ns - ns merger rate to @xmath63 myr@xmath1 while leaving the bh - bh rate untouched .",
    "the models with bh velocity kicks lead to more plausible merger rate predictions as they are safely below the limit requiring a ligo detection .",
    "they also agree well with the rates from the models of belczynski , kalogera & bulik ( 2002 ) with similar input parameters and assumptions ( see belczynski et al .",
    "2007a for a discussion of these rates ) . as mentioned in section  2 , belczynski et al .",

    "that is , these systems never survive ce .",
    "belczynski et al .",
    "( 2007a ) show that adopting this pathway reduces the merger rates of bh - bh systems by a factor of 500 compared to a reduction of only a factor of 5 for ns - ns mergers .",
    "this swing would account for the stark difference in the bh - bh / ns - ns merger ratios found in our models compared to belczynski et al .",
    "( 2007a ) and also makes a bh - bh gravitational wave detection less likely .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves with advanced ligo ( lazzarini 2007 ) will go a long way towards constraining the ns - ns and bh - bh merger rates and importantly reduce the uncertainty in the bh - bh merger rates predicted by models .",
    "this has been highlighted previously by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "the detection of a pulsar orbiting a black hole would also help to constrain many features of compact binary and pulsar evolution .",

    "the curves for all coalescing dcb system types are provided , noting that bh - bh mergers can not form gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we see that the different sgrb progenitor populations all follow very similar curves .",
    "the only slight difference is the bh - bh systems which receive reduced recoil velocities on average ( see figures  [ f : fig12ns - ns ] and  [ f : fig15ns - ns ] ) causing them to coalesce slightly closer to their original radial birth location compared to the other system types .",
    "importantly , even the ns - ns cumulative curve follows the stellar radial birth cumulative curve ( not shown ) closely . at first glance",
    "such a result is surprising : previously it has been argued that because nss receive large recoil velocities ( hobbs et al .",
    "2005 ) sgrbs should not typically appear in star forming regions ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2002 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to lgrbs whose progenitors are thought to be massive stars  young stellar systems  which should correlate well with star forming regions ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2002 ) .",
    "yet owing to a population of close double compact systems , and thus a large population of systems that coalesce rather promptly ( see figure  [ f : fig182ns - ns ] which is in line with those produced in belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 and voss & tauris 2003 ) , many of the model sgrbs merge at similar radial positions to their birth positions .",
    "as noted in section  [ s : coal ] this feature of coalescing ns - nss is also responsible for the smaller scale height of coalescing ns - nss compared to that of bh - ns coalescence ( see table  [ t : table3 ] ) .    as shown in kh09 the form of the host galaxy potential plays an important role in determining the resultant stellar kinematics .",
    "the galactic potential of our model , taken from paczyski ( 1990 ) , is more dominant than that used in voss & tauris ( 2003 ) but we do not see a significant difference in the sgrb distributions . we find that our model projected distances compare best with model f of bloom , sigurdsson & pols ( 1998 ) which assumes a similar circular velocity ( @xmath65 km s@xmath1 compared to our @xmath66 km s@xmath1 ) and an identical sn velocity kick dispersion of @xmath61 km s@xmath1 .    in figure",
    "[ f : fig19ns - ns ] we compare our sgrb models to observations of projected lgrb distances from their host galaxy centers according to bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski ( 2002 ) .",
    "we see that all model c@xmath42 coalescing dcb populations fail to reproduce the lgrb observations .",
    "this is not exactly a surprise and agrees with previous studies ( e.g. bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1999 ; belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 ; voss & tauris 2003 ) .",
    "what we emphasise here is that the difference does not arise from sne recoil velocities but instead could be telling us something about the assumed initial birth distribution of the stars and binaries . in our model",
    "the birth distribution is based on observations , in particular the distributions of ob stars and hii in the galaxy as determined by yusifov & kucuk ( 2004 ) . of course",
    ", at this stage , we are reliant upon making comparisons of two different populations , observed long gamma - ray bursts and model short gamma - ray bursts , and we note that statistics of observed sgrbs do not yet allow for meaningful comparisons ( savaglio , glazebrook & le borgne 2009 ) .",
    "another factor is that our models so far have been for the milky way whereas the lgrb observations are predominantly from dwarf galaxies ( see figure  [ f : fig22ns - ns ] and associated text ) .    to understand the grb distributions",
    "further we next provide results of lgrb models ( rather than our previous sgrb models ) to compare with the observations of _",
    "long_-grbs ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2002 ) .",
    "the method of determining lgrb progenitors is outlined in section  2 and the important point to note is that the average age of each system ( at the time of the lgrb ) is young , less than @xmath67myr , with little dependence of the formation mechanism on uncertain features of binary evolution .",
    "so it is safe to assume that the lgrbs will trace the birth positions of their progenitors very closely .",
    "this is distinct from the sgrb models where the lifetimes of coalescing systems depend upon a number of evolutionary features and assumptions ( common - envelope evolution and sne velocity kicks , for example ) as discussed in detail in sections  [ s : dcbns - ns ] and  [ s : coal ] and belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) .",

    "[ f : alphacomparison],width=317 ]    the model lgrb projected distance distribution is compared in figure  [ f : fig21ns - ns ] to the lgrb observations and our previous ns - ns - sgrb distribution .",
    "this clearly shows that both our model grbs  long and short  can not reproduce the observations of grb distances from their host galaxies .",
    "this is the case even when we allow an unrealistic radial birth description that is flat in galactic radius ( dashed - dotted line of figure  [ f : fig21ns - ns ] ) .",
    "assuming a flat radial birth distribution does increase the number of lgrbs that occur in the inner galactic regions compared to our standard lgrb and sgrb models ( though not enough compared to observations ) , however , it also produces too many grbs beyond @xmath68kpc compared to the other models .",

    "the observations of bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski ( 2002 ) are depicted by the jagged histogram .",

    "the only noticeable difference between model c@xmath42 and our @xmath24 model is the distributions beyond about @xmath72 . here",
    "the greater relative number of systems with large merger times cause the distribution to slope upward to unity slightly slower .",
    "unfortunately it is the other end of the distribution , at small distances , where the models depart from observations .",
    "this leads us to examine models of what is believed to be a more typical grb host galaxy  a dwarf galaxy .",
    "dwarf galaxies contain less mass than the galaxy , with masses of order @xmath73 , and are typically modelled by simple potentials such as in bloom , sigurdsson & pols ( 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , belczynski , bulik & rudak found that the best match to grb observations arose from a galaxy mass of @xmath74  the typical mass of a lgrb host galaxy .",
    "bloom , sigurdsson & pols ( 1999 ) and voss & tauris ( 2003 ) also accounted for different galaxy masses , however , their initial stellar birth positions were not based on observations of ob stars but instead followed the exponential disk potentials  something which can be estimated from stellar kinematics ( e.g. kuijken & gilmore 1989 ) and light profiles ( e.g. de vaucouleurs 1948 ) .",
    "however , such observations measure stellar systems that differ from grb progenitors .    to examine the effect such a small mass galaxy and gravitational potential has on our lgrb and sgrb populations we have produced two new galaxy models .",
    "the first model is a scaled down version of our galaxy where , in line with bloom , sigurdsson & pols ( 1999 ) , belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2002 ) and voss & tauris ( 2003 ) , we scale our previous model galaxy mass , as described in kh09 , by the scale parameter @xmath75 , giving us @xmath76 . assuming a constant density distribution between models , @xmath77 we then rescale the model scale lengths , scale heights and initial birth positions , also described in kh09 , by @xmath78",
    "this first dwarf galaxy model assumes @xmath69 ( giving us a similar galaxy mass and size of the favoured galaxy model in the work of belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002 ) , from which the mass of the dwarf galaxy is @xmath79 .",
    "the second model takes a spherical hernquist ( 1990 ) potential as used in kh09 but scaled so the galaxy mass is the same as in our first dwarf galaxy model , thus @xmath70 .",
    "however , we keep @xmath69 when scaling the birth distribution in galactic @xmath80 and @xmath18 .",
    "we then evolve our sgrb and lgrb progenitor systems in each of the dwarf galaxy models .",
    "the resultant projected distance curves are compared with the observations of bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski ( 2002 ) in figure  [ f : fig22ns - ns ] ( note we do not plot the sgrb model for the first scenario ) .",
    "all populations now more closely fit the observations than those in figure  [ f : fig21ns - ns ] , however , our lgrb models seem to over - estimate the number of grb systems displaced between @xmath81kpc from the host galaxy central region and under - estimate the number of grb systems displaced less than @xmath82kpc from the host galaxy .",
    "it is interesting that the best fit to the observations arises from our sgrb model , although this also under - estimates the number of grb systems that occur in the inner galactic region .",
    "the observed grb host galaxies span a great range in red shift ( @xmath83 : savaglio , glazebrook & le borgne 2009 ) and as such many grb host galaxies are low metallicity galaxies ( fruchter et al .",
    "2006 )  the average host galaxy metallicity being roughly one quarter solar ( savaglio , glazebrook & le borgne 2009 ) .",
    "the initial stellar metallicity has an important effect on governing the progenitor mass range for the formation of compact stars , in particular we note that nss may emerge from lower mass stars in low metallicity environments than could possibly occur for higher metallicity populations .",
    "therefore , compared to solar metallicity galaxies the resulting stellar and binary evolution in low metallicity galaxies could possibly extend the lifetimes of pre- and post - ns - ns formation , allowing such systems more time to evolve kinematically",
    ". this motivated us to examine what effect a low metallicity environment would have on the resultant sgrb population . to complete this we produced a sgrb model in our spherical hernquist potential and assumed a metallicity of @xmath71 , which is depicted within figure  [ f : fig22ns - ns ] .",
    "even with such a large difference in metallicity of the two sgrb models shown there does not appear to be a significant difference between their projected distance distributions .",
    "the number of model systems found close to the host galaxy ( projected distance @xmath84kpc ) is still underestimated in this model although the slope of the distribution does become less steep .",
    "although this suggests that metallicity does not play a major role in kinematics of sgrbs ( and it does not within the assumptions used here ) , if mass loss rates are found to vary strongly with z ( vink , de koter & lamens , 2001 ; belczynski et al . 2010 ) and the kick strength prescription is allowed to vary with mass of the exploding star ( e.g. from fallback as assumed in belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ) then there could indeed be a greater level of dependence on metallicity for sgrb kinematics .    our models appear to confirm current observations that lgrbs are born in star forming regions ( kelly , kirshner & pahre , 2008 ; dado & dar 2009 ) .",
    "we find that the final model grb projected distance distributions are close to their respective birth distributions , while , when compared to observations , we under - estimate the number of grbs that occur in the inner galactic region .",
    "recently fruchter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have suggested that there is a difference in lgrb and core collapse sn galactic environments .",
    "this could indicate that there is a difference in the birth distributions of the progenitors of these systems or that they arise from the same star formation distribution but from distinct progenitor mass ranges . within our models",
    "we use the same birth distribution for both our lgrb and sgrb progenitors , namely the distribution according to yusifov & kucuk ( 2004 ) which should be realistic for sn progenitors and indeed was shown in kh09 to work well for pulsar models .",
    "however , as observations of the galaxy suggest ( muno et al .",
    "2006a ; muno et al .",
    "2006b ) there appears to be a relatively large population of massive stars within the inner @xmath85pc .",
    "this may be the case for many galaxies and suggests that the yusifov & kucuk ( 2004 ) radial birth distribution is inappropriate for modelling the central galactic region .",
    "thus it is quite possible that massive stellar systems may be born with a different galactic birth distribution than standard stars . in particular",
    ", the massive stellar birth distribution may be a combination of the the typical stellar distribution and a more centralised distribution .",
    "this scenario would suit both our models and observations that the material surrounding lgrbs is being highly irradiated by approximately @xmath86 times more intensive uv radiation than that of the solar neighbourhood ( tumlinson et al . 2007 ) and that lgrbs occur in relatively low stellar density regions ( hammer et al .",
    "2006 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "it is also possible that this difference in the radial birth distribution may arise from open clusters with more massive stellar components falling quickly into the central galactic regions and becoming tidally disassociated ( as in muno et al .",
    "2006b ) or perhaps these more massive stars are formed from a metal poor distribution , allowing the birth of more massive stars that can evolve in isolation and still cause a lgrb ( yoon , langer & norman 2006 ) .",
    "the issue of whether or not lgrb and sgrb progenitors follow the same radial birth distributions has important consequences for the role that population synthesis studies can play in understanding grb observations .",
    "if they do follow the same birth distribution then population synthesis models can not reliably distinguish between lgrb and sgrb progenitors via the resultant grb - galaxy off - sets .",
    "this is because both grb populations trace star forming regions ( although given time sgrbs can also occur in old stellar systems ) .",
    "however , if the two grb populations have different galactic birth distributions , as raised in the above discussions , then further modelling of grb populations can figure prominently in shedding light on the continuing grb progenitor problem .",
    "this work investigated the stellar , binary and galactic kinematical evolutionary features of double compact binary systems and possible short gamma - ray burst ( coalescing ns - nss ) and long gamma - ray burst ( tidally influenced collapsars ) objects .",
    "the main conclusions from this investigation are summarised here :    * ns - ns systems are typically more kinematically active and have the greatest scale height of all dcbs , eclipsing the bh - bh population especially when bhs are assumed not to receive velocity kicks at birth . including electron capture supernovae into models alters this somewhat . when assuming electron capture supernovae occur and that bhs receive kicks the bh - bh population has a comparable scale height to ns - nss .",
    "* we find the double neutron - star formation rate ranges between @xmath87myr@xmath1 and @xmath88 .",
    "the lower value is set by assuming @xmath24 , the upper value by assuming ec sne occurs . our model without ec sne and with @xmath89",
    "gives a double neutron - star formation rate of @xmath90 .",
    "* our model double black - hole formation rate ranges between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the lower value arises when we assume bhs receive kicks , the upper value arises when we do not assume bhs receive kicks . *",
    "if ns - nss merge it is likely they do so within a time scale of a few million years and with a merger rate that ranges between @xmath93myr@xmath1 and @xmath94 for our models .",
    "the double neutron - star merger rates closely reflect their birth rates .",
    "* bh - bh systems typically merge more slowly than ns - ns systems and this difference is enhanced when bhs do not receive kicks .",
    "the range of merger rates for double black holes is @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "the most limiting factor is the addition of sn kicks to bh formation , while assuming @xmath24 results in a merger rate of @xmath97 .",
    "the maximum double bh merger rate arises when we assume they do not feel kicks at birth .",
    "such a high merger rate suggest that at least one merger event should have been detected with ligo .",
    "the null detection of gravitational waves by ligo gives credence to the latest findings that bhs should receive kicks at birth .",
    "* common envelope evolution is reconfirmed to be a very important process for dcb formation .",
    "in particular , merger time scales are sensitive to the number of ce phases that occur within the intervening time between sn events . decreasing the efficiency of",
    "the ce process decreases the typical merger time scale and final number of ns - ns systems .",
    "the ce phase is also important in shaping the final ns - ns eccentricity - orbital period distribution .",
    "* we find good agreement of the shape of eccentricity - orbital period distribution when compared to observations but poor agreement with observations on the relative number of high eccentricy to low eccentricy systems .",
    "including electron capture sn evolution into population synthesis models does not rectify the situation , as has been suggested previously .",
    "* we find poor agreement between the projected distance of long gamma - ray bursts from their host galaxy and the projected distances of ns - ns systems within a milky way model .",
    "* we find much better agreement between observations and models when the model galaxy mass and size is scaled down by a factor @xmath98 .",
    "owing to the short life times of our model systems ( both short gamma - ray burst and long gamma - ray burst ) the final projected distances depend heavily on the assumed radial birth distribution .",

    "<S> understanding the nature of galactic populations of double compact binaries ( where both stars are a neutron star or black hole ) has been a topic of interest for many years , particularly the coalescence rate of these binaries . the only observed systems thus far are double neutron star systems containing one or more radio pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> however , theorists have postulated that short duration gamma - ray bursts may be evidence of coalescing double neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries , while long duration gamma - ray bursts are possibly formed by tidally enhanced rapidly rotating massive stars that collapse to form black holes ( collapsars ) . </S>",
    "<S> the work presented here examines populations of double compact binary systems and tidally enhanced collapsars . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of binpop and binkin , two components of a recently developed population synthesis package . </S>",
    "<S> results focus on correlations of both binary and spatial evolutionary population characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> pulsar and long duration gamma - ray burst observations are used in concert with our models to draw the conclusions that : double neutron star binaries can merge rapidly on timescales of a few million years ( much less than that found for the observed double neutron star population ) , common envelope evolution within these models is a very important phase in double neutron star formation , and observations of long gamma - ray burst projected distances are more centrally concentrated than our simulated coalescing double neutron star and collapsar galactic populations . </S>",
    "<S> better agreement is found with dwarf galaxy models although the outcome is strongly linked to the assumed birth radial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the birth rate of the double neutron star population in our models range from @xmath0myr@xmath1 and the merger rate ranges from @xmath2myr@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper and lower limits of the rates results from including electron capture supernova kicks to neutron stars and decreasing the common envelope efficiency respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our double black hole merger rates suggest that black holes should receive an asymmetric kick at birth .    </S>",
