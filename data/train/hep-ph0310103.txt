    "while susy particles are yet to be discovered , a wide range of data has begun to limit the allowed susy parameter space .",
    "we review here what has happenned over the past year to further restrict susy models of particle physics .",
    "a number of new experimental and theoretical analyses have occurred :    the current experiments that most strongly restrict the susy parameter space are the following :    * wmap data has greatly constrained the basic cosmological parameters * while the analysis of @xmath5 data for the muon anomalous magnetic moment has not yet been completed , there has been further experimental results and theoretical analysis that have modified the theoretical standard model ( sm ) prediction of @xmath6 . * the b - factories , babar and belle measurements of the cp violating b decays , particularly @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9",
    "impose new constraints on any new theory of cp violation when they are combined with theoretical advances that have occurred in calculating these decays .",
    "in addition one must continue to impose the previously known constraints on the susy parameter space .",
    "the most important of these are :    * the light higgs mass bound @xmath10114.1 gev @xcite * the @xmath11 branching ratio constraint @xcite * the light chargino mass bound @xmath12 gev @xcite * the electron and neutron electric dipole moments bounds @xcite    in order to analyze these phenomea it is necessary to chose the susy model . at one extreme one has the mssm with over 100 free parameters ( with 43 cp violating phases ) . at the other one",
    "has msugra with four parameters and one sign ( often augmented with two or four additional cp violating phases ) .",
    "the large number of free parameters in the mssm generally allows one to fit each experimental constraint seperately by tuning one or another parameter . for msugra , where the parameters are specified at the gut scale , @xmath13 gev ,",
    "the situation is far more constrained .",
    "one can ask here if all the data taken together is still consistent with msugra ( or indeed with the standard model ) .",
    "the new b - factory data appears to be putting the greatest strain on msugra , and if the current data is confirmed , it may be that one is seeing a breakdown of msugra ( and also the sm ) for the first time and one may need a modification of the universal soft breaking assumptions of msugra .",
    "( figtanbeta10lcwmsc.eps width 8 cm )    ( figtanbeta40sugra20_3.eps width 8 cm )    ( figtanbeta50lcwm.eps width 8 cm )    we begin by reviewing the status of msugra models with r - parity invariance as of a year ago .",
    "recall that msugra depends on the following parameters : @xmath0 , the universal soft breaking mass at @xmath4 ; @xmath14 , the universal gaugino mass at @xmath4 ; @xmath15 where @xmath16 gives rise to @xmath17 quark masses .",
    "in addition , the model allows @xmath18 and the @xmath19 parameter to be complex ( where @xmath19 is the higgs mixing parameter in the superpotential term @xmath20 ) .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rge ) leading to electroweak symmetry breaking at the electroweak scale determine @xmath21 and so there can be two cp violating phases , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( in addition to the ckm cp violating phase ) . to accomodate the electron and neutron electric dipole moments",
    "we will also allow the three gaugino masses at @xmath4 to have phases : @xmath24 with the convention @xmath25 .",
    "the allowed parameter space for @xmath26 tev is shown in figs .  1 , 2 , 3 for @xmath27 , 50 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath19 real)@xcite .",
    "here the lightest neutralino @xmath30 is the dark matter candidate , and the narrow rising ( pink ) band is the region of parameter space where the predicted amount of relic dark matter left over after the big bang is in agreement with the cmb measurements of @xmath31 as of a year ago from the various balloon flights . here",
    "@xmath32 is the dark matter ( dm ) mass density , and @xmath33 is the critical density to close the universe ( @xmath34 , @xmath35=hubble constant , @xmath36=newton constant )    it is important to realize that the narrowness of the dark matter allowed band is _ not _ a fine tuning but rather a consequence of the co - annihilation effect for @xmath30 and the light @xmath37 in the early universe .",
    "this arises naturally in msugra ( and are generic features for many gut models ) due to the near accidental degeneracies between the @xmath37 and the @xmath30 and the fact that the boltzman exponential factors in the early universe annihilation analysis produces sharp cut offs in the relic density .",
    "thus the bottom of the allowed band is at the experimental lower bound on @xmath38 ( where @xmath39-@xmath40 takes its minimum allowed value ) and the top corresponds to the experimental upper bound on @xmath38 ( above which @xmath39-@xmath40 is too large to get efficient early universe annihilation ) .",
    "if one allows @xmath0 and @xmath14 to be in the multi - tev region , two additional region occur with acceptable relic density @xcite : ( 1 ) the  focus point \" region where @xmath41 tev and @xmath42 400 gev and ( 2 ) the funnel region where @xmath43 tev and @xmath44 is large .",
    "these have been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the @xmath6 data eventually confirms a deviation from the sm , would be eliminated ( as shown in the blue regions of figs . 1 - 3 )",
    "but this is still in doubt as we discuss below .",
    "however , aside from @xmath6 , these are regions of relatively high fine tuning .",
    "thus one can define the fine tuning parameter @xmath45^{1/2};\\,a_i = m_0,\\,m_{1/2},\\ , etc.\\ ] ] and @xmath46(100 km / sec mpc ) .",
    "large @xmath47 implies significant fine tuning .",
    "figs 4 and 5 @xcite show the values for @xmath47 for the focus - point region ( @xmath48 ) and the funnel region @xmath49 .",
    "one sees that in the co - annihilation region @xmath50 , while in the focus point or funnel regions @xmath51 . whether this is an argument to exclude these high fine tuning regions is a matter of taste .",
    "( figcft171.eps width 8 cm )    ( figcft50p.eps width 8 cm )",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has determined the basic cosmological parameters with remarkable precesion .",
    "what is measured is the baryon density @xmath52 , the total density @xmath53 , the hubble constant @xmath54 , as well as many other cosmological parameters . characterizing the difference between @xmath53 and @xmath52 by a cosmological constant @xmath55 , wmap finds @xmath560.044@xmath570.004 , @xmath580.27@xmath570.04 , @xmath590.73@xmath570.04 , @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is in good agreement with the direct measurement of @xmath55 using type ia supernovae @xcite and @xmath62 agrees very well with the hubble key project s direct measurement @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 is then given by @xmath64 , and there is a general concordance with a cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant .",
    "( the distinction between a cosmological constant and and a quintessence model is not yet measurable ) .",
    "the wmap @xmath65 range for @xmath63 is @xmath66 this is to be compared with the previous balloon flight measurements of @xmath67 .",
    "thus wmap has reduced the uncertainty in the amount of cold dark matter by nearly a factor of four !",
    "this can be seen in figs.1 - 3 , where the wmap allowed region is the narrow blue band .",
    "particularly striking is the reduction of parameter space for @xmath68 as seen in fig.3 .",
    "in addition an upper bound @xmath69 tev is found in @xcite .",
    "as the data becomes more and more accurates the cmb measurements will effectively determine one of the msugra parameters i.e. determine a relation of the form ( neglecting cp violating phases)@xmath70",
    "while there has been no new data this year on the muon magnetic moment anomaly @xmath72 , there has been a re - evaluation of some of the old data used to calculate the sm contribution , which has reduced the significance of the effect .",
    "we begin first by reviewing where things stood last year .",
    "first , the current experimental values of the electron @xcite and muon @xcite anomalies are @xmath73 @xmath74 the theoretical values of @xmath75 can be expressed as a power series in @xmath76 @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 begins as @xmath79 ( the schwinger term ) and the last term in eq.(6 ) are the electroweak and hadronic contributions .",
    "one equates eqs.(4 ) and ( 6 ) and solves for @xmath76 .",
    "this is currently the most accurate detremination of the fine structure constant at zero energy : @xmath80 this number is about 1.6@xmath2 down from the previously given values due to the correction of an error recently found in the @xmath81 term @xcite .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath82 can be divided into qed , electroweak and hadronic parts : @xmath83 the qed part has been calculated through order @xmath84 . fortunately , the new value of @xmath76 does not change this significantly @xcite : @xmath85 the electroweak contribution has been calculated to two loop order ( the two loop part being surprisingly large ) by two groups@xcite with good agreement yielding an average @xmath86 the hadronic contribution can be divided into three parts , a leading order , a higher order and a scattering of light by light ( lbl ) part .",
    "the latter two have been done by several groups , and there is now reasoable agreement in the lbl part:@xmath87    the term which is most unclear is the leading order hadronic contribution .",
    "this can be calculated by using a dispertion relation : @xmath88\\ ] ] in principle , one uses the experimental @xmath89hadrons cross section to calculate the integral which is dominated by the low energy part .",
    "note that @xmath90 means the experimental cross section corrected for initial radiation , electron vertex and photon vacuum polarization ( so one does not count the higher order contributions ) .",
    "a large number of experimental groups have contributed to the determination of @xmath90 and two independent ways have been used : + ( i ) direct measurement of @xmath91 with the above mentioned radiative corrections made . this data has been dominated by the very accurate cmd-2 experiment .",
    "+ ( ii ) one uses the 2@xmath92 decays of the @xmath93 , which goes through the vector ( v ) interaction , and then uses cvc to determine @xmath94 for @xmath95 gev ( the kinematic reach of the @xmath93 decay ) . here",
    "one must make corrections to account for the breaking of cvc .",
    "this data is dominated by aleph .",
    "the results of these calculation , as of last year were very puzzling .",
    "three groups did the analysis using method ( i ) getting almost identitical answers@xcite .",
    "an average value was @xmath96 .",
    "however , using the @xmath93 data ( augmented by the @xmath97 data at higher energy ) , ref.@xcite found @xmath98 .",
    "( in fact , the @xmath97 and @xmath93 data were inconsistent with each other at the level of 4.6@xmath2 ! ) the @xmath97 data gave rise to a 3.0@xmath2 disagreement between experiment and the sm while the @xmath93 gave a smaller 1.0@xmath2 disagreement .",
    "recently , however there have been new results that have significantly reduced the discrepancy between the two approaches and between experiment and the sm .",
    "cmd-2 found an error in its analysis of the radiative correction to be made to their @xmath99 had data ( a lepton vacuum polarization diagram was omitted ) . a full re - analysis of the sm value of @xmath100",
    "was then carried out in @xcite with the results now of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the discrepancy with the sm now becomes @xmath103 @xmath104 corresponding to 1.9@xmath2 and 0.7 @xmath2 descrepancy respectively .",
    "however the @xmath93 data still disagrees with the @xmath97 data at a 2.9@xmath2 level ( the disagreement occuring particularly at @xmath105 mev ) and so a puzzle still remains .",
    "one may expect some further clarification in the not too distant future .",
    "thus the brookhaven analysis of their @xmath5 data should reduce the experimental error on @xmath106 .",
    "further , new data from kloe and babar can check the cmd-2 results . in figs.(1 - 3 )",
    ", we have shown the excluded region in the parameter space ( blue ) if the descripency with the sm is @xmath107 ( i.e.about 1@xmath2 from zero ) .",
    "a large amount of parameter space is eliminated .",
    "babar and belle have now measured with increasing accuracy a number of cp violating b decays .",
    "this has opened up new tests of the standard model and new ways to search for new physics .",
    "simultaneously , improved techniques for calculating these decays have been developed over the past two years by beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda @xcite ( bbns ) and these procedures have been further discussed by du et al .  @xcite . in previous analyses using the so - called  naive factorization \" , decay amplitudes for @xmath108 depend on the matrix elements of operators @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and these matrix elements were factorized to calculate them . in the bbns scheme ,",
    " non - factorizable \" contributions can be calculated allowing the calculations of the strong phase , which is needed to discuss direct cp violation .",
    "we consider here the decays @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the results below are presented using the bbns analysis and we discuss here the decays for sugra models . we require , of course , the simultaneous satisfaction of the dark matter , the @xmath114 branching ratio , the electron and neutron edm constraints etc .    the b - factories measure a number of parameters of the b decays that relate to cp violation .",
    "thus the time dependent cp asymmetry for @xmath115 decaying into a final state @xmath116 is given by : @xmath117 which is parametrized by @xmath118 with @xmath119 is the @xmath120 mass difference .",
    "for charged modes one has @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath123 give a measure of direct cp violation .",
    "in addition the branching ratios have been well measured .",
    "we consider first the decay @xmath111 .",
    "the babar and elle measurements give @xcite .",
    "@xmath124 in the standard model for any decay @xmath125 , @xmath126 should be close to @xmath127 of the ckm matrix and indeed an evaluation of the ckm @xmath128 ( without using the b - factory data ) gives @xcite @xmath129 in good agreement with eq.(19 ) .",
    "since @xmath111 proceeds through the tree diagram in the sm while susy effects begin only at the loop level , one would expect only a small susy correction to @xmath130 , again in accord with eqs .",
    "note also that the smallness of @xmath131 implies that there is very little direct cp violation .",
    "we consider next the @xmath3 decays .",
    "these decays begin for both the sm and susy at the loop level and so deviations from the sm result might occur . using the recent new data from belle @xcite and the preliminary analysis of new babar data",
    "@xcite one has : @xmath132    we see that @xmath133 differs from the expected standard model result of @xmath134(given in eq.(19 ) ) by higher than the published older data@xcite , are so if the latter were used the discrepancy would be even larger ] 2.7 @xmath2 .",
    "in addition babar has measured @xcite @xmath135% .",
    "further suggestion that there may be a breakdown of the standard model comes from the babar and belle measurements of the branching ratios @xcite : @xmath136 @xmath137    [ 0.85]branching ratio of @xmath138 at @xmath139 .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to @xmath140 , dashed curve for @xmath141 with @xmath142 and the dot - dashed curve for @xmath140 with @xmath143 .",
    "the two straight lines correspond to the cases without weak annihilation @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.80]branching ratio of @xmath138 at @xmath144 .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to @xmath140 , dashed curve for @xmath141 with @xmath145 and the dot - dashed curve for @xmath140 with @xmath143 .",
    "the two straight lines correspond to the cases without weak annihilation @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    while the bbns analysis is a significant improvement over naive factorization , it is not a complete theory .",
    "the largest theoretical uncertainty comes from the weak annihilation diagram ( where a gluon splits into two final state quarks ) .",
    "these diagrams have divergent end - point integrals @xmath146 ( which are cut off at @xmath147 ) and parametrized by : @xmath148 fig .",
    "6 shows the dependence of @xmath149 on @xmath150 for @xmath151 , and fig .",
    "7 the dependence on @xmath152 for @xmath150=0 .",
    "we see that the branching ratio over the most of the parameter space is @xmath153 and does not get large unless @xmath152 is near its maximum ( @xmath154 ) and @xmath150 is near 0 ( or 2@xmath92 ) .",
    "however , figs 6 and 7 also show that when the branching ratio becomes large and is then in accord with the experimental value of eq.(23 ) , the weak annihilation diagram dominates the decay amplitude , and so the theory is least reliable .",
    "thus in the region where the theory is most reliable the predicted sm branching ratio is too small and in order to obtain a sm value in accord with experiment , one must go to a region of parameters where the theory is least reliable .",
    "( a similar result holds for @xmath155 .",
    ") however , even if one were to do this , it would not resolve the 2.7@xmath2 discrepancy of @xmath133 , since @xmath133 is insensitive to @xmath152 and @xmath150 .",
    "hence that discrepancy with the sm would still remain .",
    "one can next ask if the susy corrections of msugra can resolve the difficulties of the sm for the @xmath156 decays .",
    "the answer is no .",
    "one finds , as one varies @xmath44 , @xmath18 , @xmath14 that @xmath157 which is essentially the same as the sm value and is in disgareement with the experimental value of eq.(21 ) ) . also , unless the weak annihilation diagrams are larger @xmath158 for msugra and again is too small to account for the experimental values of eqs.(22 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "the reason msugra can not account for a reduction of @xmath133 from the sm value is that in msugra the only flavor violating source is in the ckm matrix which can not provide enough flavor violation in the @xmath159 transition of the @xmath160 decays .",
    "one can ask whether one can add any non - universal soft breaking terms to msugra to try to account for the apparent disagreement between experiment and the sm in @xmath133 . in a gut model ,",
    "at least the sm gauge group must hold at @xmath4 and so there are only two ways one can enhance mixing between the second and third generations .",
    "one can have non - universal squark masses , @xmath161 , at the gut scale or non - universal a terms in the u or d sectors .",
    "the first possibility gives rise to left - left or right - right couplings only , and it was shown in @xcite that these produce only a small effect on the @xmath160 decays .",
    "we therefore consider instead @xmath162 terms which produce left - right couplings@xcite .",
    "we write @xmath163 here @xmath164 are the yukawa matrices and so the first term in the universal contribution .",
    "we assume that @xmath165 has non - zero elements only for @xmath166 , @xmath167 or @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and write @xmath170 . tables 1 and 2 , for @xmath48 and 40 show that there is a wide range of parameters that can accommodate the experimental results of eq .",
    "( 21 ) with @xmath171 .",
    "we assume here parameters such that the weak annihilation effects are small and so the theoretical uncertainty is reduced . in spite of this the large experimental branching ratio of @xmath3 are achieved as can be seen in table 2 .",
    "( @xmath172 is @xmath173 for all entries of table 1 ) .",
    "the parameter space giving satisfactory results for the case of @xmath174 is more restrictive generally requiring large @xmath44 and lower @xmath14 as can be seen in the examples in table 3 .",
    "however , it is still possible for the theory to be within @xmath175 of the experiment with reasonable choices of parameters .",
    ".@xmath176 at @xmath48 with non - zero @xmath177 and @xmath178 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in all the above cases ( @xmath179 or @xmath180 ) the direct cp violating effects are small i.e. @xmath181% and also we find @xmath182% .",
    "we see thus that a non - universal a term can account for the b - factory results on @xmath3 decays .",
    "we have surveyed here three developments of the past year that have further narrowed the parameter space of possible susy models : the new wmap data , the status of the muon magnetic moment anomaly , and the belle and babar data on cp violating b decays .",
    "we have examined these questions within the framework of sugra gut models as these have fewer free parameters , and so are more constrained by the array of other data , the full set of all the data allowing one to see more clearly what the constraints on susy are .",
    "the wmap data has determined the basic cosmological parameters with great accuracy , and this new data has reduced the error in the values of the cold dark matter density by a factor of about four . in the region of parameter space @xmath0 and @xmath1 tev , it implies for msugra ( and many sugra gut models ) that the lightest stau is only 5 -10 gev heavier than the lightest neutralino ( the dark matter candidate ) .",
    "as the data from wmap ( and later planck ) become more and more accurate , these measurements will effectively determine @xmath0 in terms of the other msugra parameters , a result that could be tested later at high energy accelerators .",
    "the cmd-2 reanalysis of their @xmath183 data has reduced the disagreement between the standard model prediction of the muon magnetic moment and the brookhaven measurements . thus using this data one",
    "now finds a 1.9@xmath2 disagreement , but using instead the tau decay into 2 @xmath92 final states plus cvc , there is only a 0.7@xmath2 discrepancy .",
    "however , the matter is still not clear as the @xmath183 data is still in disagreement with the tau data at the 2.9 @xmath2 level .",
    "future precision data from kloe and perhaps babar using the radiative return method should help clarify the issue as these experiments will be able to check the cdm-2 data .",
    "the brookhaven analysis of their @xmath5 data will further reduce the experimental error on the muon magnetic moment .    perhaps the most interesting new data this year is the belle and babar measurements of the cp violating parameters and branching ratios of @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "current data for @xmath186 is in disagreement with the standard model at the 2.7@xmath2 level , and further , susy corrections based on msugra give essentially the same results as the standard model .",
    "in addition , over most of the parameter space , the standard model and msugra predict branching ratios for these decays that are a factor of two or more too low .",
    "sugra models offer an essentially unique way of accommodating both anomalies by adding a non - universal contribution mixing the second and third generations in either the up or down quark sectors to the cubic a soft breaking terms at @xmath4 . if added to the down quark sector , this term would also lower the cp odd higgs mass opening up a new region in the @xmath187 plane satisfying the relic density constraint .",
    "( dark matter detector signals would not be increased , however . )",
    "if added to the up quark sector it would lower the stop mass again giving a new region consistent with dark matter , and making the @xmath188 more accessible to colliders .",
    "thus if this new data is further confirmed , it would indicate the first breakdown of the standard model and perhaps point to the nature of physics at the gut and planck scales , as string models with this type of non - universality can be constructed .",
