    "<S> we present a model for the seeding and evolution of magnetic fields in protogalaxies . </S>",
    "<S> supernova ( sn ) explosions during the assembly of a protogalaxy self - consistently provide magnetic seed fields , which are subsequently amplified by compression , shear flows and random motions . </S>",
    "<S> our model explains the origin of strong magnetic fields of @xmath0 g amplitude within the first starforming protogalactic structures shortly after the first stars have formed .    </S>",
    "<S> we implement the model into the mhd version of the cosmological n - body / sph simulation code gadget and we couple the magnetic seeding directly to the underlying multi - phase description of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we perform simulations of milky way - like galactic halo formation using a standard @xmath1cdm cosmology and analyse the strength and distribution of the subsequent evolving magnetic field .    within starforming regions and given typical dimensions and magnetic field strengths in canonical sn remnants , </S>",
    "<S> we inject a dipole - shape magnetic field at a rate of @xmath210@xmath3 g gyr@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the magnetic field strength increases exponentially on timescales of a few ten million years within the innermost regions of the halo . furthermore , turbulent diffusion , shocks and gas motions transport the magnetic field towards the halo outskirts . at redshift z@xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , the entire galactic halo is magnetized and the field amplitude is of the order of a few @xmath0 g in the center of the halo and @xmath210@xmath3 g at the virial radius .    </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we analyse the intrinsic rotation measure ( rm ) of the forming galactic halo over redshift . the mean halo intrinsic rm peaks between redshifts z@xmath24 and z@xmath22 and reaches absolute values around @xmath5 rad m@xmath6 . while the halo virializes towards redshift z@xmath20 , the intrinsic rm values decline to a mean value below @xmath7 rad m@xmath6 . at high redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of individual starforming and thus magnetized regions is widespread . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a widespread distribution of large intrinsic rm values .    in our model for the evolution of galactic magnetic fields , the seed magnetic field amplitude and distribution </S>",
    "<S> is no longer a free parameter , but determined self - consistently by the star formation process occuring during the formation of cosmic structures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it provides a solution to the seed field problem .    </S>",
