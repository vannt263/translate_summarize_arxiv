    "cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with ultra - relativistic jets from short - lived powerful sources such as hyper - accreting , just - born black holes .",
    "the jet starts as an opaque blackbody fireball that accelerates , expands and releases its thermal radiation at the photospheric radius @xmath2 .",
    "one may expect a quasi - blackbody spectrum from such jets ( paczyski 1986 ; goodman 1986 ) , similar to the relict radiation from the big bang .",
    "however , the simpe blackbody model is inconsistent with observations ( e.g. preece et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is clear that some form of heating operates in the jet and changes its radiation from blackbody .",
    "heating may occur at radii @xmath3 and change the photospheric radiation via comptonization .",
    "it may also occur at radii @xmath4 and generate nonthermal synchrotron emission .",
    "two heating mechanisms are usually considered in grb jets : internal shocks and dissipation of magnetic energy .",
    "the details of both mechanisms are uncertain as they depend on complicated _ collisionless _ processes in the plasma .",
    "a long - standing problem is the radiative efficiency of these processes .",
    "recent observations by _ fermi _ telescope provided new data in a broad spectral range from 8 kev to @xmath5  gev .",
    "the data confirm the previous batse result that the prompt grb spectrum typically peaks near mev ( preece et al .",

    "the spectrum of grb emission at very high energies @xmath8  gev remains so far uncertain .",
    "multi - gev photons overlapping the prompt mev radiation have been detected in about 5 per cent of grbs , however they may be produced by a distinct source at large radii , e.g. by the blast wave from the explosion .",
    "the distinct source is visible in several gev - emitting bursts ( e.g. abdo et al .",
    "2009b ; ryde et al .",

    "observational search for this emission usually assumed that it has a quasi - thermal spectrum ( e.g. ryde 2005 ) .",
    "it was argued that the absence of the photospheric emission component would imply that the jet is magnetically dominated and cold , with negligible initial thermal energy ( e.g. daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ; zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "the main finding of the present paper is that the band - type spectrum naturally forms in grb jets as a result of _ collisional _ heating .",
    "most of radiation produced by this mechanism is emitted near the photosphere @xmath6 and therefore it may be called photospheric to a first approximation .",
    "our result supports the view that photospheric emission is not a rare quasi - thermal component ; instead , it is the main band component of grb emission that is routinely observed in all bursts .",
    "this paper considers the standard model of a baryonic jet with comparable numbers of neutrons and protons ( our model would not work for jets that are completely dominated by magnetic field , with negligible baryonic loading ) . before becoming transparent to radiation",
