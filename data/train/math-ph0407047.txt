    "spectral graph theory studies linear operators which are associated with graphs .",
    "the goal is to see how properties of the graph are reflected in properties of the operators and vice versa .",
    "this has attracted vivid interest in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "the kind of graphs we shall be concerned with in this paper are bond - percolation graphs @xcite , a special type of random subgraphs of the @xmath0-dimensional integer lattice .",
    "they are of popular use in physics for modelling various types of random environments @xcite . on these graphs we consider laplacians with different kinds of boundary conditions at cluster borders and study some of their spectral properties . apart from the non - randomness of the spectrum , and of the spectral components in the lebesgue decomposition",
    ", we show the existence and self - averaging of the integrated density of states .",
    "the main result establishes lifshits tails of the integrated density of states at the lower and upper spectral edge in the non - percolating phase . depending on the boundary condition and on the spectral edge , the lifshits tail discriminates between stretched ( i.e.  linear ) and condensed ( i.e.cube- or ball - like ) clusters which contribute the dominating eigenvalues .",
    "the crucial technical estimates in our proof are cheeger @xcite and faber - krahn @xcite isoperimetric inequalities on graphs .",
    "our analysis here is facilitated by the fact that in the non - percolating phase almost all graphs consist of infinitely many finite clusters . yet",
    ", the non - percolating phase gives rise to interesting phenomena , because it supplies clusters of arbitrarily large size . in the percolating phase one",
    "has to cope with the infinite cluster , too , which requires a more intricate understanding",
    ". this case will be studied in @xcite .",
    "related previous work can be found in @xcite .",
    "spectral properties of laplacians on bond - percolation ( or related ) graphs have been studied in the physics literature , see the general accounts @xcite or the recent examples @xcite for applications to soft matter .",
    "the lifshits tails , whose existence we prove here , were sought after in the numerical simulations @xcite for the neumann laplacian on two- and three - dimensional bond - percolation graphs .",
    "the tails could not be observed there due to finite - size corrections and the considerable numerical effort needed to access such rare events . for the different case of erds  rnyi random graphs , however",
    ", the existence of lifshits tails for the neumann laplacian was known on the basis of analytical , non - rigorous arguments @xcite , which inspired our proof here .",
    "moments of the eigenvalue density for this model were rigorously analysed in @xcite .",
    "other models in the physics literature deal with the adjacency operator on bond - percolation graphs @xcite .",
    "quite often , this goes under the name quantum percolation . yet , from a rigorous mathematical point of view , all of the above models with off - diagonal disorder have remained widely unexplored , see however @xcite .",
    "in contrast , laplacians on _ site_-percolation graphs of the @xmath0-dimensional integer lattice belong to the class of models with diagonal disorder . therefore they are closer to the range of applicability of the highly developed theory of random schrdinger operators @xcite .",
    "this is partly of help for analysing their spectral properties with mathematical rigour . for finite - range hopping operators on site - percolation graphs , the non - randomness of the spectrum and existence of the integrated density of states",
    "was shown in @xcite .",
