    "in the current literature on quantum mechanics an almost disproportionate amount of attention is being attracted by the so called exactly solvable ( es ) models of dynamics . after a more detailed inspection",
    "the concept gets split into several subcategories .",
    "the main divide may be spotted between the es property of the piece - wise constant `` point '' interactions ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref.@xcite ) and the es property of a family of polynomially solvable analytic potentials ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , one of their lists in ref.@xcite and the recent developments of the _ exceptional _ and the _ multi - indexed orthogonal polynomials _ in refs.@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the resulting point - or - analytic classification of the es models is not too satisfactory , for several reasons . in what follows",
    "we intend to emphasize that one of these reasons is that the respective construction techniques ( i.e. , the matching of wave functions in the case of point interactions and the closed - form constructions of wave functions in the case of analytic interactions ) are independent and could be combined .",
    "thus , in place of the point - or - analytic divide one encounters a non - empty third domain of the possible coexistence of the two approaches .    in the language of mathematics",
    "the new , intermediate es domain will inherit some weaknesses of the former , elementary - function es domain which admits non - polynomial wave functions and in which the related determination of spectra is partially numerical",
    ". only the latter , analytic - solvability domain remains , strictly speaking , non - numerical and characterized not only by the polynomiality of the wave functions but also by the presence of various inherent symmetries in combination with a comparatively low degree of flexibility  _ pars pro toto _ let us mention the frequent `` shape invariance '' property and/or the supersymmetry - representing relations between the different analytic es potentials @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the essence of the former , point - interaction approach to the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath4 may be seen in a suitable _ ad hoc _ split of the real line of coordinates @xmath5 into subintervals , @xmath6 inside these subintervals the potential function @xmath0 is being chosen constant ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , the square - well model nr.26 on p.52 in @xcite with @xmath7 or several other models of this type in @xcite ) or at least sufficiently elementary  cf . ,",
    "e.g. , the @xmath8 coulomb + square - well model nr.28 on p.64 in @xcite or the most recent symmetrized morse - potential short - range - interaction one - dimensional model of ref.@xcite with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in practice , the piecewise - nonconstant potentials @xmath0 are rarely treated as es ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite or the model nr.28 in @xcite once more ) . even in the above - mentioned methodical studies  @xcite",
    "it has been revealed that from the purely numerical point of view the traditional `` shooting and bracketing '' algorithm seems more efficient than the direct use of the available ( viz . , confluent hypergeometric function ) piecewise analytic and asymptotically correct representations of the individual bound - state wave functions @xmath11 .",
    "recently , a fairly persuasive counterargument against the resulting scepticism has been provided by ishkhanyan @xcite . in a way which we now perceive as disproving the discouraging experience of refs.@xcite he took into consideration a new @xmath9 model with @xmath12 ( and , in our present language , with @xmath10 )",
    ", he constructed its asymptotically correct wave functions @xmath11 ( again , in a closed form derived from the confluent hypergeometric functions ) and , finally , he succeeded in showing that the matching condition ( in the origin ) appears numerically extremely friendly .",
    "the ishkhanyan s conclusions may be perceived as a gem of a new paradigm , recommending an immediate extension of the standard es domain of the use of matching techniques which were , up to now , virtually exclusively applied just to the piecewise constant potentials . in parallel ,",
    "the ishkhanyan s experience may be also perceived as a decisive encouragement of transition to the infinite - series versions of special functions . indeed , a transition to non - truncated , non - polynomial confluent hypergeometric wave functions is also one of the key characteristics of his `` screened - coulomb '' model with @xmath12 .",
    "see also the most recent ref.@xcite in this context .    in certain sense",
    "these innovative observations may be perceived as weakening the well known exclusivity of the confluent hypergeometric functions in elementary quantum mechanics ( well sampled by their applications in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the essence of their popularity may be traced back to their ability of termination ( to laguerre polynomials ) . naturally ,",
    "there exist several other special functions _ without _ such a degeneracy option . in the new paradigmatic framework , their possible use in solving eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) should certainly be thoroughly reconsidered at present , therefore .",
    "we shall recall here the bessel functions as one of the most natural illustrative examples .",
    "a serendipitous additional merit of these functions is that they might provide the piecewise analytic general solutions of eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) in the case of various piecewise exponential potentials such that @xmath13 for @xmath14 . in what follows",
    "we shall simplify the problem ( choosing @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and we shall bring a number of arguments supporting the effective es status of the model .",
    "our one - dimensional schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) will be considered with potential @xmath15 the model may admit , first of all , the discrete and non - degenerate and finitely many bound - state energies @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "see the fourth paragraph in appendix a in this connection .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions must be normalizable , @xmath18 .",
    "since the potential is parity invariant , @xmath19 , the eigenfunctions are also parity invariant , @xmath20 according to the conventional oscillation theorems @xcite the subscript @xmath21 counts the _ nodes _ of the eigenfunctions .",
    "moreover , we may only consider the ( say , positive ) half - axis of @xmath22 , with @xmath23 i.e. , with the eigenfunctions constrained by the parity - dependent boundary condition in the origin .",
    "let us introduce an auxiliary function @xmath24 , @xmath25 which maps @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] to @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "with this function , the schrdinger equation for the discrete spectrum @xmath29 is rewritten as the equation for bessel functions , @xmath30 the general solutions are obtained as linear combinations of two types of bessel functions . in the maple - inspired notation @xcite we may use either the negative - sign ansatz ,",
    "@xmath31 or its positive - sign alternative , @xmath32 these solutions are to be constrained by the appropriate asymptotic boundary conditions and by the matching of their logarithmic derivatives in the origin .",
