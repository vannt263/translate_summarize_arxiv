    "the chemostat model provides the foundation for much of current research in bio - engineering , ecology , and population biology @xcite . in the engineering literature ,",
    "the chemostat is known as the continuously stirred tank reactor .",
    "it has been used for modeling the dynamics of interacting organisms in waste water treatment plants , lakes and oceans . in its basic setting , it describes the dynamics of species competing for one or more limiting nutrients .",
    "if there are @xmath0 species with concentrations @xmath1 for @xmath2 and just one limiting nutrient with concentration @xmath3 and dilution rate @xmath4 , then the model takes the form    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the per capita growth rate of species @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the time derivative of any variable @xmath9 .",
    "( in much of the paper , we simplify our notation by omitting the arguments of the functions .",
    "for instance , when no confusion can arise from the context , we denote @xmath10 simply by @xmath3 . ) the functions @xmath6 depend only on the nutrient concentration , and are zero at zero , continuously differentiable and strictly increasing , although non - monotone functions have been the subject of research as well .",
    "the conversion of nutrient into new biomass for each species @xmath7 happens with a certain yield @xmath11 and the natural control variables in this model are the input nutrient concentration @xmath12 and the dilution rate @xmath13 .",
    "the latter variable is defined as the ratio of the volumetric flow rate @xmath14 ( with units of volume over time ) and the reactor volume @xmath15 which is kept constant .",
    "therefore it is proportional to the speed of the pump that supplies the reactor with fresh medium containing the nutrient .",
    "the equations ( [ model - full ] ) are then straightforwardly obtained from writing the mass - balance equations for the total amounts of the nutrient and each of the species , assuming the reactor content is well - mixed .",
    "the full model ( [ model - full ] ) is illustrated in figure [ chem ] .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the case where there is just one species with concentration @xmath16 , in which case the equations ( [ model - full ] ) take the form @xmath17 ( but see theorem [ iss - track ] below for results on chemostats with disturbances , and section [ several ] for models involving several species ) .",
    "we assume @xmath12 is a given positive constant , while the per capita growth rate @xmath18 is a monod function ( which is also known as a michaelis - menten function ) taking the form @xmath19 for certain positive constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 that we specify later .",
    "the dilution rate is an appropriate continuous positive periodic function we also specify below . since @xmath22",
    "when @xmath23 is near zero , one can readily check that ( [ model - reduced ] ) leaves the domain of interest @xmath24 positively invariant ( i.e. , trajectories for ( [ model - reduced ] ) starting in @xmath25 remain in @xmath25 for all future times ) ; see theorem [ iss - track ] for a more general invariance result for perturbed chemostats .",
    "since we are taking @xmath12 to be a fixed positive constant , we rescale the variables to reduce the number of parameters . using the change of variables @xmath26 and dropping bars , we eliminate @xmath12 and @xmath27 and so obtain the new dynamics @xmath28 again evolving on the state space @xmath29 .    .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the literature focusing on what makes our approach different . in section",
    "[ track ] , we fix the reference signal we wish to track . in section [ define ] , we precisely formulate the definitions and the stability problem we are solving .",
    "we state our main stability theorem in section [ thm ] and we discuss the significance of our theorem in section [ discuss ] .",
    "we prove our stability result in section [ main ] . in section",
    "[ several ] , we show that the stability is maintained when there are additional species that are being driven to extinction .",
    "we validate our results in section [ simulations ] using a numerical example .",
    "we conclude in section [ concl ] by summarizing our findings .",
    "the behavior of the system @xmath30 is well understood when @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive constants , as well as cases where @xmath31 and either of these control variables is held fixed while the other is periodically time - varying .",
    "see @xcite for periodic variation of @xmath12 and @xcite for periodic variation of @xmath13 and the general reference @xcite on chemostats . when both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants , the so - called `` competitive exclusion principle '' holds , meaning that at most one species survives .",
    "mathematically this translates into the statement that system @xmath30 has a steady state with at most one nonzero species concentration , which attracts almost all solutions ; see @xcite .",
    "this result has triggered much research to explain the discrepancy between the ( theoretical ) competitive exclusion principle and the observation that in real ecological systems , many species coexist .",
    "the results on the periodically - varying chemostat mentioned above should be seen as attempts to explain this paradox .",
    "they involve chemostats with @xmath31 species , and their purpose is to show that an appropriate periodic forcing for either @xmath32 or @xmath33 can make the species coexist , usually in the form of a ( positive ) periodic solution .",
    "few results on coexistence of @xmath34 species are available .",
    "an exception is @xcite , where a periodic function @xmath32 is designed ( with @xmath13 kept fixed ) so that the resulting system has a ( positive ) periodic solution with an arbitrary number of coexisting periodically varying species .",
    "the stability properties of this solution are not known .",
    "more recent work has explored the use of state - dependent but time invariant feedback control of the dilution rate @xmath13 to generate coexistence ; see @xcite for monotone growth rate functions in the @xmath31 species case , and @xcite for the @xmath35 species case .",
    "the paper @xcite considers feedback control when the growth rate functions are non - monotone . in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "coexistence is proved for models taking into account intra - specific competition . in these models ,",
    "the usual growth functions @xmath36 are replaced by functions @xmath37 which are decreasing with respect to the variable @xmath1 .",
    "all the results discussed so far apply to a more general model than @xmath38 involving @xmath39 species .",
    "this is because the main purpose of these papers is to investigate environmental conditions under which the competitive exclusion principle fails and several species can coexist .    here",
    "we will not consider any coexistence problems .",
    "our main objective is to provide a proof of stability of a periodic solution based on a lyapunov - type analysis and to investigate the robustness properties of the periodic solution with respect to perturbations .",
    "as an illustration we show that the stability of the periodic solution is robust with respect to additional species that are being driven to extinction , or to small disturbances on the initial nutrient concentration or dilution rate .",
    "these features set our work apart from the known results on periodically forced chemostat models which do not rely on the construction of a lyapunov function .",
    "proving stability in the chemostat usually relies on reduction and monotonicity arguments , and not so often on lyapunov functions ( but see for instance theorem @xmath40 in @xcite which uses a lyapunov function introduced in @xcite and more recently @xcite ) .",
    "finally we point out that closely related to our results is @xcite where a single - species chemostat with a continuous and bounded ( but otherwise arbitrary ) function @xmath32 and constant dilution rate is investigated ; there it is shown that two positive solutions converge to each other . however , the proof is not based on a lyapunov function .",
    "the advantage of having a lyapunov function is that it can be used to _ quantify _ the effect of additional noise terms on the stability of the unperturbed dynamics .",
    "in fact , to our knowledge , our work provides the first input - to - state stability analysis of chemostats whose dilution rates and initial concentrations are perturbed by small noise ; see remark [ aboutiss ] for a discussion on the importance of input - to - state stability in control theory and engineering applications .",
    "we first choose the dilution rate @xmath41 that will give a reference trajectory @xmath42 for ( [ model ] ) which we show to be stable .",
    "we assume a growth rate with constants @xmath43 as @xmath44 @xmath45 which we refer to as a _ reference trajectory _",
    "when we choose @xmath46 condition ( [ mbound ] ) then provides constants @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for all @xmath49 : @xmath50 see figure [ refff ] for the graph of @xmath33 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we wish to solve the following stability problem :    * * * given any trajectory @xmath53 for ( [ model ] ) corresponding to the dilution rate @xmath33 from ( [ chli ] ) and @xmath18 as in ( [ mbound ] ) ( i.e. for any initial value for @xmath54 ) , show that the corresponding deviation @xmath55 of @xmath54 from the reference trajectory ( [ reftraj ] ) asymptotically approaches @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "we will solve ( sp ) by proving a far more general tracking result for a single species chemostat acted on by a disturbance vector @xmath58 as follows : @xmath59(1+u_2(t)-s(t))-\\mu(s(t))x(t)\\\\[.5em ] \\dot x(t)&= & x(t)[\\mu(s(t))-d(t)-u_1(t ) ] \\end{array } \\right .. \\ ] ] we will quantify the extent to which the reference trajectory ( [ reftraj ] ) tracks the trajectories of ( [ mod1 ] ) . to this end , we need to introduce a priori bounds on @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; see remark [ bound - u ] .",
    "our main theoretical tool will be the input - to - state stability ( iss ) property @xcite which is one of the central paradigms of current research in nonlinear stability analysis ; see remark [ aboutiss ] .",
    "the relevant definitions are as follows .",

    "for example , @xmath86 is the solution of ( [ mod1 ] ) for the disturbance @xmath87 satisfying the initial condition @xmath88 .",

    "[ aboutiss ] the theory of iss systems originated in @xcite .",
    "iss theory provides the foundation for much current research in robustness analysis and controller design for nonlinear systems , and has also been used extensively in engineering and other applications @xcite .",
    "the iss approach can be viewed as a unification of the operator approach of zames ( e.g. @xcite ) and the lyapunov state space approach .",
    "the operator approach involves studying the mapping @xmath103 of initial data and control functions into appropriate spaces of trajectories , and it has the advantages that it allows the use of hilbert or banach space techniques to generalize many properties of linear systems to nonlinear dynamics .",
    "by contrast , the state space approach is well suited to nonlinear dynamics and lends itself to the use of topological or geometric ideas .",
    "the iss framework has the advantages of both of these approaches including an equivalent characterization in terms of the existence of suitable lyapunov - like functions ; see remark [ pba ] below . for a comprehensive survey on many recent advances in iss theory including its extension to systems with outputs , see @xcite .    to specify the bound @xmath104 on our disturbances @xmath105 ,",
    "we use the following constants whose formulas will be justified by the proof of our main stability result : @xmath106",

    "the positive invariance of @xmath120 follows .",
    "[ means ] theorem [ iss - track ] says that in terms of the error signals @xmath144 , any componentwise positive trajectory of the unperturbed chemostat dynamics ( [ mod1 ] ) converges to the nominal trajectory ( [ reftraj ] ) , uniformly with respect to initial conditions .",

    "hence , only componentwise positive solutions are of interest . therefore ,",

    "our reasons for using the transformed form of the error are as follows .",
    "the function @xmath159 goes to @xmath160 when @xmath16 goes to zero .",
    "this property is relevant from a biological point of view .",
    "indeed , in the study of biological systems , it is important to know if the concentration of the species is above a strictly positive constant when the time is sufficiently large or if the concentration admits zero in its omega limit set . in the first case ,",
    "the species is called _",
    "persistent_. the persistency property is frequently desirable , and it is essential to know whether it is satisfied .",
    "hence , the function @xmath161 has the desirable properties that ( a ) it goes to @xmath162 if @xmath163 does , ( b ) it is equal to zero when @xmath164 is equal at time @xmath165 to the value of @xmath148 , and ( c ) it goes to @xmath166 if @xmath164 goes to zero .",
    "therefore , roughly speaking , if the species faces extinction , then it warns us .",
    "[ pba ] our proof of theorem [ iss - track ] is based on a lyapunov type analysis .",

    "the function @xmath174 we will construct in the proof of theorem [ iss - track ] is not an iss - lf for the chemostat error dynamics because of the specificities of the state space , which preclude the existence of the necessary functions @xmath175 in condition 1 above .",
    "hence , we can not directly apply the result that the existence of an iss lyapunov function implies that the system is iss e.g. ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) to prove our theorem .",
    "instead , we prove our theorem [ iss - track ] directly from the decay inequality satisfied by the time derivative of @xmath174 along the trajectories .",
    "the proof that the decay inequality implies iss is very similar to that part of the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) , so we only sketch that part of our proof in the appendix .",
    "[ bound - u ] our estimate ( [ cru1 ] ) would not hold if we had instead chosen the full control set @xmath176 .",

    "therefore extinction would occur and ( [ cru1 ] ) would not be satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , if our set @xmath146 is replaced by @xmath183 ^ 2 $ ] for any fixed constant @xmath184 , then the chemostat error dynamics instead satisfies the less stringent _ integral _ iss property ; see remark [ iiss - rk ] below for details .",
