    "be pushed to the highest possible values , but also the collision rate , i.e. the machine luminosity , needs to be pushed to unprecedented values . in consequence , new or interesting physics events will be covered by a large amount of well established standard model processes .",
    "todays largest collider complexes are the actual running tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory , batavia , il in the united states and the soon to be completed lhc at cern , geneva , switzerland .",

    "the interval between subsequent beam - crossings amounts to 396  ns , corresponding to a beam - crossing rate of 2.5  mhz .",
    "two general - purpose experiments , d  @xcite and cdf  @xcite are recording those proton  anti - proton collisions passing their respective trigger schemes .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a proton - proton super - conducting collider operating at @xmath2  tev at a nominal luminosity of @xmath3 .",

    "+ , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    reading out the detector data at the fixed beam crossing rate and analyzing the data off - line is beyond imagination of todays data acquisition , data storage , and data processing systems . a powerful selection mechanism is therefore needed to select , as early as possible in the data acquisition chain , only those particle collisions promising to contain interesting physics while simultaneously reducing the overall data rate by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this is the role of the trigger , which e.g. at the tevatron detectors cdf and d  reduce the initial beam crossing rate by @xmath9 , and at the lhc detectors atlas and cms by @xmath10 .",
    "one has to note here that the number of proton - proton collisions is , due to multiple interactions per beam crossing , in average @xmath11 times larger than the beam crossing rate at the tevatron collider and even @xmath12 times larger at the lhc .",
    "given that only one of these multiple interactions give raise to a trigger signal , one can also state that the actual physics selection of the trigger system selects one proton - proton collision out of @xmath10 at cdf and d  and one out of @xmath13 at atlas and cms .",
    "the data acquisition system , however , can not distinguish between the actual proton - proton collision that activated the trigger and the extra collisions that took place within the same beam crossing .",
    "all proton - proton collisions in a beam crossing are read - out simultaneously ; in analogy of looking at a photo that has been exposed multiple times .",
    "this changes terminology of what is meant by an event . often , an event is referred to as all the tracks and energy deposits for a single proton - proton collision .",
    "however , in high luminosity colliders , a event is whatever tracks and energy deposits are read out per beam crossing . tracks and energy deposits , not originating from the primary proton - proton collision that caused the trigger to fire ,",
    "is called _ pile - up_.    precision measurements in contrast to discovery physics are often severely disturbed in the presence of large pile - up .",
    "therefore , data taken when instantaneous luminosity is reduced ; e.g. in the start - up phase of a new accelerator ( assuming an already well understood detector ) or at the end of an accelerator coasts , has much reduced pile - up and thus provides a cleaner environment to allow for some precision studies  at the cost of a reduced statistical data set for the analysis .",
    "a powerful and flexible trigger is the cornerstone of a modern high energy and high luminosity collider experiment .",
    "it dictates what physics processes can be studied properly and what is ultimately left unexplored .",
    "the trigger must also offer sufficient flexibility to respond to changing physics goals and to new ideas . if the trigger is not able to achieve sufficient selectivity to meet these requirements , the physics potential of the experiment will be seriously compromised .    in an idealistic high energy physics experiment , enough bandwidth and enough cpu power would be available to analyze every single proton - proton collision and then decide whether the event contained interesting physics . in real life , available resources are limited and trigger strategies based on the existence of one or few trigger objects need to be implemented in a cost efficient manner .      features that distinguish interesting and/or new physics from the bulk of standard model processes at colliders are typically the presence of high-@xmath14leptons @xmath15 , photons , and jets , or large missing transverse energy ( neutrinos , or other weakly or non interacting new particles ) , as they occur in very hard interactions or as decay products from new heavy particles .",
    "especially clean signatures arise if the leptons , photons or non - interacting particles are not covered inside jets but are _ isolated_.      triggering on high-@xmath14leptons provides the primary means of selecting events containing w , z and higgs bosons in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 decays , as well as super - symmetric particles in @xmath19 , @xmath20 decays .",
    "leptons can also tag heavy quarks such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 s through their semi - leptonic decays . in the latter",
    ", a @xmath22-tag can be obtained through a lifetime selection of the relatively long lived b - meson , which leads to non - pointing high-@xmath14leptons with respect to the primary interaction vertex .",
    "triggering on high-@xmath14tau - leptons can lead to increase in statistical samples , where the high-@xmath14electron- and muon - trigger samples need to be enhanced .",
    "however , the signature of tau s is all but clean due to leptonic decays of the tau into a lighter lepton and two neutrinos @xmath23 or its semi - leptonic decays into hadrons and a tau neutrino @xmath24 .    in the pure leptonic case ,",
    "the electron- or muon - trigger have a chance to select tau events in cases where the energy carried away by the escaping neutrinos is not too high and the transverse momentum @xmath14of the decay lepton is still above the trigger threshold .",
    "semi - leptonic tau - decays can be triggered by means of isolated , high-@xmath14tracks or very narrow jets .",
    "high-@xmath14tau - triggers are more complex than other lepton triggers , still they provide an important handle to new physics . for instance , due to the relative strong coupling of tau to the higgs particle , which is enhanced with respect to the coupling to lighter leptons as @xmath25 , the decay mode @xmath26 is of interest for higgs discovery in the low higgs mass region  @xcite . in some of the large @xmath27 susy scenarios ,",
    "@xmath28 is grossly enhanced over a wide range of higgs mass  @xcite .      triggering on high-@xmath14photons",
    "is of prime interest for light higgs searches , such as @xmath29 , as a very clean signal is expected for higgs masses below @xmath30120 gev  @xcite .    on the other hand , high-@xmath14photons occurring in qcd processes via quark - gluon compton scattering or quark - anti - quark annihilation",
    "are often seen as background for the quest of new physics . nevertheless , these photons are useful in global fits providing parton density functions to be used in monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "photons from highly energetic @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons are a major background to prompt photon signals .",
    "as these mesons are produced within jets , an isolation criteria can be used to suppress such photons .",
    "photons originating from high-@xmath14electrons undergoing bremsstrahlung are another source of background , which can be suppressed after reconstruction of the electron track , and after identification of a kink in the electron track .      triggering on high-@xmath14jets",
    "is hampered by the fact that jets are produced abundantly in hadron colliders , as the standard qcd processes @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with one or more extra gluons produced by qcd bremsstrahlung .",
    "high-@xmath14jets which can hint for new physics occur from @xmath36 , with x being a new heavy particle decaying hadronically into quark - quark , quark - lepton , or quark + missing energy .",
    "as the cross section for high-@xmath14qcd jets is dropping more steeply than the expected cross section for jets stemming from new heavy particles they can be distinguished statistically in the high energy end range of the jet energy spectrum .",
    "it is therefore useful to look for combinations of multiple high-@xmath14jets , high-@xmath14jets plus leptons or high-@xmath14-jets plus missing energy in order to reach conclusive results about possible heavy states in proton - proton collisions .    another possible way to improve the signal to",
    "noise ratio stemming from qcd jets is to select those jets only that manifest from the hadronization of a @xmath22-quark .",
    "with the @xmath37 production cross section being @xmath38 lower than the production of light di - quarks , signal to noise ratios can be expected up to @xmath39 enhanced , depending on the process under study .",
    "higgs searches in the low mass region relying solely on a @xmath22-tag to search for @xmath40 events is close to impossible for reasons of bandwidth and cpu power available for the trigger selection processing , because the @xmath37 production rate is @xmath41 . in associated higgs production , where besides the higgs particle also two top - quarks are produced , as in @xmath42",
    ", the @xmath43 process can be searched for .",
    "this requires a multi - object trigger , with asking for two @xmath22-tagged jets from the @xmath43 decay , another two @xmath22-tagged jets from the two top - quark decays with @xmath44 and depending on the decay modes of the w - boson a lepton tag from the @xmath16 decay or two light - quark jets from the @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays .",
    "triggering on missing energy is a window for new physics occurring from @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being one or more new heavy particles which are either stable and non - interacting with the surrounding detector elements , or which decay into particles of which at least one escapes detection due to non - interaction with the surrounding detector elements .",
    "important for missing energy is that the invisible particle carries away a large amount of the available energy in transverse direction to the beam line .",
    "missing energy combined with leptons / photons or jets can be a manifestation of the presence of large extra dimensions , different susy configurations , or other new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "events containing multiple leptons and missing energy are often referred to as the _ gold - plated _ susy discovery mode .    obviously , missing energy can occur also due to detector inefficiencies , dead areas , noise , as well as non - hermeticity of the detector .",
    "still , triggering on missing energy is key for the quest in finding new physics , which requires a detailed understanding of the detector response .      triggering on total scalar sum of all transverse energy deposits in all calorimeter cells and without further requirements on the event topology",
    "allows for an open search for new heavy state particles .",
    "however , the summing up of all calorimetric cell energy deposits can be very susceptible to both noise and pile - up effects and can not be easily calibrated unlike calibrating individual jet energies . therefore a modified total scalar transverse energy sum @xmath49is used instead . experiments usually define @xmath50as the sum over the leading jet s transverse energies :    @xmath51    often the leptons transverse energies and @xmath52are also added :    @xmath53    note that electrons and to some extent taus , via the electron from the @xmath54 decay , are already accounted for in @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath49trigger can capture high jet multiplicity events such as those from fully hadronic top decay , hadronic decays of squarks and gluinos .",
    "these events have a total transverse energy of several hundred gev .",
    "they may actually fail the jet triggers because individual jet transverse energies can be softer than the sustainable thresholds of individual- and multi - jet triggers .      in a first step ,",
    "the trigger has to identify the trigger objects in every event .",
    "identifying e.g. an isolated high-@xmath14electron and measuring at least its transverse momentum is a multi - step procedure . in an initial step ,",
    "energy deposits in the trigger towers of the electro - magnetic calorimeter need to be looked for and pattern recognition is needed to identify close - by energy deposits as a single energy cluster and then to determine the total energy deposit , and the centre of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , pattern recognition needs to identify whether the cluster is well isolated from other energy deposits and especially whether it is well isolated from energy deposits in the hadronic calorimeter , which usually follows the electro - magnetic calorimeter .",
    "after these steps , an isolated electromagnetic cluster is identified that could either stem from an isolated electron or photon .",
    "distinguishing the two cases requires further analysis of the tracking system . in the most trivial formulation ,",
    "a cluster that stems from an electron has also a corresponding electron - track pointing to it .",
    "however , as electrons can undergo bremsstrahlung and as photons can convert into electron - positron pairs , deciding whether an electro - magnetic cluster stems from an electron is complex and resource intensive .",
    "the trigger performs a chain of selection criteria on every trigger object hypothesis to discriminate between promising physics within the huge background .",
    "this is often called a _ trigger chain _",
    "( sometimes also called _ trigger line _ or _ trigger path _ by different experiments ) . for every trigger object hypothesis one or more trigger chains",
    "are operated in parallel on every event .",
    "this includes also combinations of trigger objects , where e.g. two high-@xmath14muons or jets are asked for .",
    "select events according to some well known properties of the wanted physics process , often including event topology and invariant mass cuts , and usually lead to relatively small accept rates .",
    "trigger objects are combined at the trigger level and an event is rejected if none of the wanted topologies is found .",
    "try to be as open as possible and select events based on the presence of a single trigger object ; e.g. a lepton with a transverse momentum @xmath14larger than a defined threshold .",
    "inclusive trigger chains can lead to very high accept rates , even beyond the capacity of the data acquisition system for detector read out .",
    "a remedy for this is to raise the energy and momentum thresholds for these trigger objects until acceptable rates are obtained that the data acquisition system can handle .",
    "needless to mention that doing so can lead to missing a certain class of physics events .",
    "therefore , inclusive trigger chains at relatively low energy and momentum thresholds need to be maintained .",
    "the high accept rates are reduced based on a random selection ; i.e. only every @xmath55 event will be accepted for detector read out , which is often called _ pre - scaling_.      are formed from all trigger chains , exclusive , inclusive , pre - scaled and non - pre - scaled , that are operated together and in parallel during a data taking run .",
    "the trigger menu defines the strategy of selecting events , which are believed in advance of being interesting .",
    "i.e. theoretical models and detailed monte carlo simulations guide the definition of the trigger menus .",
    "nevertheless , the unexpected shall not be lost and thus trigger menus usually contain a mixture of exclusive and inclusive trigger chains .",

    "potential biases that can be introduced by such methods need to be controlled and cross - checks with pre - scaled trigger chains at reduced transverse energy and momentum thresholds are needed .",
    "often so called minimum bias events are used for the determination of selection efficiencies . since the probability for finding a high-@xmath14trigger object in a minimum - bias data sample is usually very low , minimum - bias events are only useful to measure selection efficiencies of trigger chains that themselves require only a moderate-@xmath14 . therefore",
    ", low- and/or moderate-@xmath14trigger objects need to be added to the trigger menu , usually with a high pre - scaling . from there",
    "onwards , a recursive procedure can be defined that allows to measure the selection efficiency of all trigger chains .",
    "the trigger menu must also ensure the allocation of adequate bandwidth for calibration , monitoring , and background samples .",
    "these must be provided in order to calibrate the detector and to control systematic errors .",
    "balancing the event rates and the data volume , which can still be handled by the data acquisition system , while maximizing the physics reach of the experiment is just one of those optimizations that will continuously need to be taken care of  throughout the lifetime of an experiment ..    trigger menus especially need to be adjusted following the accelerator instantaneous luminosity , where ( some of ) the trigger chains need to be pre - scaled or even be disabled completely according the actual instantaneous luminosity , beam and detector conditions and taking into account the priorities of physics goals defined by the collaboration .",
    "the trigger has to be capable of implementing the full trigger menu with all trigger chains being executed in parallel .",
    "every trigger chain in turn implies the execution of a number of sequential steps that step by step validate the trigger chain or reject it .",
    "the initial steps need to be executed at the bunch crossing rate dictated by the accelerator , whereas later steps have more relaxed timing constraints .",
    "it is therefore natural to implement a multi - level trigger to execute the sequences of the trigger chains .",
    "the first level trigger ( l1 ) has to operate at the collision rate of the accelerator and usually can not be implemented using commodity components . an implementation based on custom electronics and utilizing fast field programmable gate arrays",
    "( fpgas ) and digital signal processors ( dsps ) is unavoidable .",
    "only a small sub - sample of the detector data can realistically be fed into the l1 trigger hardware , and only relatively simple algorithms can be executed . furthermore , changing algorithms at l1 , other than what can be done by re - configuration of pre - scales and threshold values , is close to impossible or implies major upgrades .    for second and third level triggers ( l2 ) and ( l3 ) relaxed requirements on decision latency and data volume exist .",
    "this allows the use of more generic processing units and even personal computers ( pcs ) to be used .",
    "the big advantage that follows from such an approach is the utmost flexibility on the trigger algorithms that implement the sequences of every trigger chain .",

    "the l1 electronics for the rpcs is based on the spatial and time coincidence of hits in four rpc muon stations .",
    "the candidate track is formed by a pattern of hits that matches with one of many possible patterns pre - defined for muons with defined transverse momenta .",
    "the @xmath14value is thus given .",
    "trigger primitives from the dt , csc and rpc l1 electronics are collected and converted into muon tracks where also transverse momentum @xmath14 , pseudo - rapidity @xmath32 and azimuth @xmath82 are assigned .",
    "in addition , the @xmath83 coordinates are correlated with the signals from the calorimetric towers to decide whether the muons are isolated .",
    "the cms l1 trigger electronic is limited to a maximum accept rate of @xmath84  hz and delivers trigger decisions in 3  @xmath59s at the beam - crossing rate of 40  mhz .",
    "random coincidences , energy - loss fluctuations and multiple - scattering need to be taken into account in the l1 trigger logic and softens the sharpness with which a muon s @xmath14can be determined .",
    "the effect of this can also be seen in figure  [ fig : cmsl1muon ] , where the cms l1 muon rate is shown as a function of the muon-@xmath14 .",
    "the l1 muon rate is constant just below @xmath84  hz for muon-@xmath14@xmath85  gev and falls off softer than the `` true '' muon rate , which has been generated using monte - carlo simulation , for larger values of @xmath14 . even at a @xmath14threshold of 100  gev , where signal muon events will be rare , close to 100  hz of muon l1 trigger accept rate",
    "is expected .",
    "a higher level trigger decision is thus needed to re - analyze these muons with greater precision .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc did not chose to build a l1 tracking trigger .",
    "however , the cdf and d  experiments at tevatron does trigger on tracks already at l1 .",
    "the reason for atlas and cms of not implementing tracking triggers at l1 are primarily due to involved complexity and extra costs for with respect to the expected gain in physics coverage . with an l1",
    "accept rate of up to 100  khz and a data acquisition system providing ample bandwidth to move detector data following a l1 accept to the next trigger level , extra tracking information at l1 becomes redundant . only in the case where low-@xmath14physics , where all particles produced in a collision are below threshold of @xmath86  gev , would need to be studied more carefully ,",
    "tracking at l1 becomes relevant .",
    "the standard model use case motivating tracking rigger at l1 is b - physics , where a b - quark fragments into a relatively long - lived b - meson that decays either hadronically or leptonically into particles showing a common displaced vertex with respect to the main @xmath7 collision vertex . looking again at figure  [ fig : xsec ] , one recognizes a total rate of @xmath37 production of close to @xmath87  hz , which would be unimaginable to handle in a general purpose experiment as atlas or cms",
    ". the lhcb experiment is specially built to measure b - physics and its first trigger level has indeed an accept rate of @xmath88  hz  @xcite . atlas and cms will play their role in b - physics whenever the b - particle decays in a sufficiently high-@xmath14muon or muon - pair  @xcite .    at tevatron",
    "the cdf and d  experiments both implement tracking triggers at l1  @xcite , which allows them to further reduce the l1 accept rate .",
    "fake muon tracks selected by the l1 muon system , but due to random coincidences , neutron background or from real muons that stem from @xmath89 decays will thus no - longer contribute to the overall l1 accept rate .",
    "in addition , the cdf experiment also identifies displaced vertices already at l1 which improves the b - physics potential of the cdf experiment .",
    "trigger objects identified by the l1 calorimeter , muon and , if applicable , tracking trigger need to be combined and matched against the trigger menu before a global l1 trigger decision can be taken .",
    "this is the task of the _ l1 global trigger _",
    "( sometimes also called _ l1 central trigger _ by different experiments ) . in most experiments this is done by counting the number of isolated and non - isolated l1 trigger objects that are above a predefined set of transverse energy and transverse momentum threshold . in most experiments no exclusive trigger chains can thus be applied in l1 trigger menus .    a special feature worth noting is the capability of the cms l1 global trigger which also considers topological features of trigger objects based on pseudo - rapidity @xmath32 and azimuth @xmath82 information  @xcite .",
    "the cms l1 trigger menu can thus be enriched with a set of exclusive trigger chains .",
    "an example being e.g. two isolated electrons or muons with a back - to - back signature and opposite charge , or any other relative opening angle .",
    "although the atlas l1 trigger provides extra geometry information with every l1 trigger object , this information , however available , is not further considered at l1 but directly passed to the l2 trigger .",
    "the strategy of l2 triggers is to refine l1 trigger decisions and to combine trigger objects identified by l1 , e.g. in combining data across detectors to form higher quality trigger objects and examining event - wide correlations in all l2 trigger objects .",
    "the d  and cdf experiments pass the l1 trigger objects and some detector data to the l2 electronics .",
    "the l2 triggers for d  and cdf are both based on a mixture of custom built electronic boards and general purpose processors accepting input signals at the respective l1 accept rates of @xmath90  khz in the case of d  and @xmath91  khz in the case of cdf .",
    "a l2 decision is taken in @xmath92s to reduce the event rate further down to @xmath63  khz at d  and in @xmath93s to reduce the event rate further down to @xmath94  khz at cdf .",
    "the differences in the l2 accept rates and latencies for the two experiments is a mere choice of the collaboration .",
    "large latencies imply more time to execute the selection steps for every trigger chain of the trigger menu on the cost of providing larger buffering and also larger processing environment in proportion to the l1 accept rate times latency .",
    "when a large latency of @xmath39  ms or higher can be afforded , an interesting possibility opens .",
    "it becomes possible to implement the execution of the selection steps in a pure software based environment , providing utmost flexibility in adopting selection strategies and improving trigger menus according the evolving needs and requirements that come up during the whole running time of the experiment .",
    "this has been the choice of the atlas and cms experiment .",
    "the atlas l2 trigger is a farm of @xmath95  pcs equipped with dual multi - core cpus . as pcs",
    "are commodity devices , they can be easily replaced with faster models and thus a continuous improvement of the total available processing power can be expected .",
    "every l2 pc in atlas treats one or more l1 accepted events in parallel . for every event ,",
    "information from the l1 trigger is passed to a l2 pc , which consists of so called region of interest ( roi ) information .",
    "the roi information contains meta data of the l1 trigger objects found , such as trigger object types e.g. electron / photon clusters , jets , @xmath52 , muons and their respective trigger thresholds passed , and for every trigger object also their coordinates in pseudo - rapidity @xmath32 and azimuth @xmath82 space .",
    "the l2 pc subsequently collects detector data from the atlas read - out system in order to confirm or reject one l1 trigger object after the other , and to refine trigger objects with extra detector data ; e.g. in finding tracks from the inner tracker that match with a cluster found in the calorimeter or with a muon track found in the muon system .",
    "an average latency of @xmath96s of cpu time spent per event is deemed to be sufficient to execute the atlas l2 selection . with most events being rejected within @xmath97s , and a correspondingly larger time budget available for more interesting events .    only about 2% of the data volume of 1.6  mb per event",
    "needs to be moved at l1 rate from the detector read - out system to the l2 trigger and analyzed , corresponding to @xmath98  gb / s .",
    "a dedicated commodity gigabit ethernet network can handle such data volumes .",
    "an important difference between the atlas and the cms experiment is that the cms experiment decided against a dedicated l2 trigger as cms performs the next selection step directly at l3 .      in all experiments at tevatron and lhc ,",
    "the l3 trigger is a computer farm that uses software algorithms for particle identification after event reconstruction . the final rate for writing events to tape is between @xmath99  hz for the various experiments .",
    "high level triggers ( hlts ) are pc farms that are flexible , that do not require special infrastructure for the development of trigger algorithms other than a laptop . in principle",
    "complex offline - like algorithms can be executed . on the other side , many hundreds or thousands of pcs need to be operated reliably in a huge farm . assuring a proper load - balancing when assigning an event to be executed on an individual pc requires non - trivial management of the data flow that also needs to be robust against non - responding pcs due to crashes or other failures .",
    "the cms experiment decided for a hlt farm capable of absorbing the events at the 100  khz accept rate of their l1 trigger .",
    "the main problem for this is again the data movement , as at a l1 event rate of 100  khz and a typical event size of 1  mb a total data volume of 100  gb / s arises .",
    "the final size of the farm is not yet determined as this depends a lot on the availability of fast multi - core cpus and the execution speed of the selection software . at an average latency of @xmath78",
    "ms per event , one estimates @xmath100  cpu cores that need to be operated in parallel  @xcite . today ,",
    "pcs with 8  cpu cores are easily available and pcs with 16 and more cpu cores are expected within a year .",
    "this translates to @xmath101  pcs to be operated .",
    "also atlas plans to deploy 2000  pcs for its hlt operation , with @xmath102  pcs being used for the l2 trigger and @xmath103  pcs utilized for the l3 selection .    at the time of this write - up it",
    "is not yet clear which of the two approaches will result as the better choice for the experiments trigger selection .",
    "as the trigger chains require sequential steps to be executed , the decision taking processes become equivalent in both experiments .",
    "the difference however is that in the case of cms the complete event data is available for processing already after l1 , which in principle allows to play sophisticated tricks with some exclusive selection of lower-@xmath14physics events that otherwise would not have been selected online  assuming availability of enough cpu resources to execute more trigger chains in parallel .",
    "note that also the atlas l2 trigger has access to all detector data - in principle . with more cpu resources available and an upgrade of the commodity gigabit ethernet network",
    ", low-@xmath14track searches could also be performed in atlas .",
    "a question that is often asked is whether it is possible to discover physics that was not thought for when defining the trigger chains and when setting up the trigger menu .",
    "there is no simple answer to this question .",
    "as can be seen from the trigger menu presented in table  [ tab : cmsmenu ] , simple trigger chains have been defined for selecting single - jet events at l1 with a transverse momentum as low as @xmath14=20  gev .",
    "however , a huge pre - scale value of @xmath58 is required to yield an accept rate of 1.7  khz . if there are enough cpu resources available at the following selection steps , a detailed search for low-@xmath14phenomena can still be done  with a corresponding loss of available luminosity for such a trigger chain , as given by the pre - scale value .",
    "another exotic case that can be difficult to trigger on are the production of slow but heavy particles that only decay after having traveled many centimeters or even meters into the detector  @xcite . as these particles are supposedly slow , they may or may not be associated in the read - out with their original beam - crossing and could appear as a stand - alone events .",
    "the original event may or may not show enough missing transverse energy @xmath72and the decay products of this heavy particle are likely not to match any of the trigger masks that would execute a l1 accept , especially if it decays into muons or even worse , into neutrinos .",
    "thus there is always room for the unexpected to escape detection , even in the most sophisticated trigger systems of today .",
    "a powerful and flexible trigger system is decisive in a modern high luminosity collider experiment .",
    "it dictates on the physics processes that can be explored and on what is ultimately left unexplored .",
    "trigger menus need to be carefully composed from trigger chains , which ultimately identify the trigger objects in a sequence of processing steps that define the selection process and span over multiple trigger levels .",
    "discarding unwanted trigger objects early in a sequence of selection steps is key in reducing the overall requirements for bandwidth and cpu resources .",
    "the largest fraction of rate reduction is therefore usually performed at the l1 trigger level , which , due to its hardware - based implementation , and fixed wiring , also provides the most rigid infrastructure for event selection .    with the availability of higher bandwidth for read - out and the massive amount of cpu resources that can be provided by means of large cpu farms ,",
    "the event selection is , wherever possible , no longer performed in a custom built electronics environment , but in a flexible and adaptive software environment , executing selection processing on many hundred or thousands of pcs , all working in parallel .",
    "this trend will continue , as it provides the most flexible environment to adopt new trigger strategies , and to compose new trigger menus containing new ideas for individual trigger chains ; e.g. taking into account complex event topologies .",
    "the lhc accelerator is proposed to be upgraded to the super - lhc ( slhc )  @xcite , where luminosity will be increased by a factor of ten to @xmath104  =  @xmath105  @xmath106s@xmath107 while the proton - proton centre of mass energy will remain at @xmath108  tev .",
    "the beam - crossing interval is likely to double to 50  ns , with its final value not yet concluded .",
    "assuming 50  ns , an average of 500  pile - up events will occur with every beam - crossing , which will lead to higher occupancy and radiation - levels in the detector systems .",
    "replacing some of the detector infrastructure , notably the tracking devices , will likely be required . regarding the trigger systems , the l1 calorimetric triggers of atlas and cms",
    "may just need to be raise their thresholds , whereas the l1 muon triggers will suffer from a higher fake muon rate .",
    "this is especially true for the cms muon system , where multiple scattering of muons in the iron - core has lead to the definition of many more patterns that need to be matched against hits found in the cms muon systems to form l1 muon tracks . at slhc ,",
    "the l1 muon fake rate is likely to be a major issue and a match with l1 tracks from a new to be built inner tracker is being considered  @xcite .",
    "the atlas l1 muon system is much less exposed to multiple scattering effects due to its air - core toroid magnet .",
    "therefore , the atlas l1 muon trigger is thought to be able to cope even with a ten - fold increase of luminosity .",
    "average event size will be higher at slhc , due to higher occupancy in the detector elements .",
    "the read - out elements and bandwidth to the pc farms for the higher level triggers , as well as their cpu resources will need to be upgraded .",
    "however , the overall strategy , as it has been described in this paper , provides enough flexibility to be also valid at slhc .      the international linear collider ( ilc ) global design  @xcite effort proposes the next high energy and high luminosity collider to be an electron - positron linear collider at a centre of mass energy of @xmath109  gev at a luminosity of @xmath110  @xmath106s@xmath107 .",
    "the beam will arrive in a train of 2625 bunches within 970  @xmath59s , with a bunch spacing of 370  ns .",
    "every 200  ms a new train of 2625 bunches will arrive at the collision point , which leaves an interval of 199.3  ms with no collisions . for the trigger and data - acquisition system at a future ilc experiment , an interesting possibility opens . during the 970  @xmath59s ,",
    "where collisions take place every 370  ns , all the detector signals can be kept in on - detector memories . during the 199.3  ms with no collisions , all the detector signals can be read out and sent to a big pc farm , where the complete trigger menu can be executed .",
    "a hardware based l1 trigger , with its rigidity against adopting trigger strategies , is no longer needed ; assuming that enough bandwidth for the read - out and enough cpu resources for the execution of the trigger menu can be provided .",
    "as pointed out in section  [ triggerstrategies ] , the _ ideal _ trigger for a high energy and high luminosity collider can become reality at future ilc experiments .",
    "the author likes thank his many colleagues widely spread over many experiments from d , cdf , atlas and cms . without having tea or coffee with many of them at the cern cafeteria and elsewhere ,",
    "this article would not have been possible to realize .",
