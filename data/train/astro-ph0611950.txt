    "though the existence of intermediate - mass black holes in star clusters remains controversial , our theoretical understanding of the problem has advanced on two fronts .",
    "first , important conclusions have been reached from purely theoretical considerations , including the density profile of the cusp surrounding the black hole @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as the response of the stellar distribution to the steady transport of stars into the vicinity of the black hole , where they are tidally disrupted , contributing to the growth of the black hole .",
    "two - body relaxation is the vital process which controls the rate at which this flux can be sustained .",
    "second , a succession of simulations have added much detail to the general theoretical picture .",
    "these simulations have been based on a variety of techniques : monte carlo methods based on a fokker - planck treatment of relaxation with an anisotropic distribution of velocities @xcite ; finite - difference solution of the fokker - planck equation for both anisotropic @xcite and isotropic distribution functions @xcite ; gas models , in which relaxation is mimicked by a suitably crafted form for thermal conductivity in a self - gravitating gas @xcite ; a tree code @xcite ; and , most recently , direct @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .    in many of these studies",
    ", emphasis is given to the details of the cusp and the growth of the black hole , and less attention is paid to the evolution of the star cluster . in this letter",
    "we shall show that rather simple considerations allow us to predict also the evolution of the structure of the cluster , in particular its core radius .",
    "the basic idea is a familiar one in the stellar dynamics of star clusters , where it was introduced by @xcite .",
    "this idea is that the flux of energy from the centre of a star cluster must reach an equilibrium with the flux ( by relaxation ) across the outer parts of the cluster , conventionally taken to be the half - mass radius .",
    "if too much energy is generated the core of the star cluster must expand to quench the generation of energy there , no matter what is the mechanism of energy generation ; while insufficient generation of energy leads to the familiar process of core collapse .",
    "for the case of a central black hole , energy is generated as stars fall by relaxation towards the radius around the black hole at which they are disrupted . though the link between the energy generated in the cusp and the expansion of the system has been discussed previously ( see sec.[sec : discussion ] ) , we believe that the theoretical estimate of the core radius in this letter ( eq.([eq : scaling ] ) ) is novel .",
    "here is an outline of the letter . in the following section we review the basic results on the flow of energy through the cusp around the black hole",
    "then we apply hnon s argument , which establishes the way in which the radius of the core varies with the mass of the black hole .",
    "next we compare our prediction with existing data from simulations , and finally discuss the place of our result within the literature on this subject .",
    "we consider a cluster of mass @xmath2 containing a central black hole of mass @xmath3 . the black hole is surrounded by a cusp , which merges at its edge into a core of nearly constant density ( fig.[fig : fit ] ) . beyond the core radius the density falls off again in the halo of the star cluster .    inside the cusp ,",
    "the flux of energy at radius @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the stellar density , @xmath7 is the mean square stellar velocity , and @xmath8 is the relaxation time .",
    "this is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath11 is the individual stellar mass .",
    "hence @xmath12 in the part of the cluster where the potential is dominated by the black hole , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the velocity dispersion in the core of the cluster , we have @xmath15 , and so @xmath16 if the flux is independent of @xmath4 @xcite we get @xmath17 .    at the edge of the cusp we have @xmath18 , and",
    "so the radius of the cusp is @xmath19 at this radius we also have @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the density in the core , and so @xmath22",
    "in steady post - collapse expansion this must balance the energy flux at the half - mass radius , which is @xmath23 where the subscript @xmath24 denotes conditions at the half - mass radius .",
    "estimating @xmath25 and equating @xmath26 to @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath28 if conditions are approximately isothermal between the core radius , @xmath29 , and the half - mass radius , we can estimate @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whence @xmath32    this scaling of core radius with black hole mass is expected to be approximately valid provided that the resulting core radius exceeds that of the cusp around the black hole ( eq.[eq : rcusp ] ) . using the above estimate for @xmath33 , it follows that @xmath34 for a sufficiently massive black hole , the density profile may show no sign of a core radius .",
    "this conclusion was already reached by @xcite , though they modelled systems with a core radius independent of the black hole mass .",
    "a fit to numerical data ( sec.[sec : fit ] ) , however , yields a coefficient of about @xmath35 in eq.([eq : rcusp_on_rc ] ) , and we find that , even up to a black hole mass of order 10% of the cluster mass , the radius of the cusp is less than half the core radius . on the other hand unless @xmath3 is large enough , the cusp contains too few stars to provide a signature of the presence of the black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite have carried out a series of @xmath1-body simulations with stars of equal mass and several different values for the initial black hole mass .",
    "in addition , unpublished data from some of these runs allow us to measure the core radius for intermediate values of the black hole mass , which increases during the course of each simulation .",
    "the measurement of core radius is not entirely straightforward , however .",
    "while the @xmath1-body code itself gives a current value of the `` core radius '' @xcite , this is based on a density - weighted average of the distances of stars from the density centre .",
    "because the computed density around the black hole increases with increasing black hole mass , this approach introduces a mass - dependent bias which leads to an underestimate of the true core radius for large black hole masses .",
    "@xcite adopted a more observational procedure , and estimated the core radius as the radius at which the surface density drops to half its central value ; but this is also biased in the same way .",
    "therefore we have taken a different approach , in which we fit the density distribution in the simulation by a template which describes the cusp around the black hole embedded in a core . specifically , we fitted the density at radius @xmath4 by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are parameters . for @xmath38 ( no cusp )",
    "this resembles closely the so - called eff model for the distribution of density in a star cluster with a core @xcite .",
    "the fit is not good at large radii ; by experimenting , we found that the mean square residual was minimised if data outside about @xmath39 were rejected ( fig.[fig : fit ] ) .",
    "[ fig : fit ]    figure [ fig : radii ] shows fits of our theory to the data we have obtained in this way .",
    "the points on the left ( crosses ) come from one simulation , and plot the evolution of @xmath40 as the black hole grows .",
    "the early points in particular do not fit the predicted power law very well , and we consider that these correspond to the period during which equilibrium has not yet been established between the flux of energy at the half - mass radius and that provided by the cusp .",
    "the points on the right ( boxes ) represent four different simulations , with different initial black hole mass , late in the evolution .",
    "the agreement with our theory is better , but the theory depends implicitly on a homology assumption , and the slightly discrepant slope may be due to small departures from homology ; this is not unexpected , given that the values of @xmath40 extend up to about @xmath41 .",
    "the important result to be obtained from this figure is that the core radius _ increases _ with black hole mass , which is the opposite of the conclusion that would be drawn from table 1 of @xcite in that table should be @xmath42 . ] .",
    "there the core radius was estimated from the radius at which the surface density drops to half its central value ( see above ) , and the fact that their paper considered clusters with a stellar mass function is not relevant in the present context .",
    "@xcite found that the dependence of core radius on @xmath3 is flatter than we predict , but there the quoted core radius was estimated as in @xmath1-body models ( see above ) .    [ fig : radii ]",
    "in this letter we have argued that a balance is reached between the energy production of the cusp and the energy required for expansion of the entire cluster .",
    "previously @xcite considered that there should be a balance between energy production of the cusp and that required for expansion of the _ core_. this , however , leads to the relation @xmath43 constant , independent of the mass of the black hole and cluster .",
    "this is certainly incorrect when the the black hole mass is very small .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite also , in effect , equated the generation of energy in the cusp to the energy required to expand the core ; in fact , however , most of the energy passes through the core to the half - mass radius , as it provides the energy needed for the expansion of the entire cluster .",
    "@xcite equated the energy generation to that required at @xmath44 , but assumed a constant value of @xmath45 . @xcite and @xcite took a homology model for the stellar system , which was thus characterised by a single scale radius .    the theory we have presented depends on a number of assumptions .    1 .",
    "it applies only to systems with stars of equal mass , though there is no reason to suppose that it does not extend , with suitable modification of detail , to systems with a realistic mass spectrum .",
    "2 .   it also depends , though in an inessential way , on the assumption that @xmath46 . in fact @xmath1-body models , albeit with a mass spectrum @xcite , show that the @xmath7 varies by only about 30% between @xmath44 and @xmath47 . if instead we had assumed that @xmath48 , where these results imply that @xmath49 , our result ( eq.([eq : scaling ] ) ) would have changed from a power law index of @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles of some clusters require larger values of @xmath52 , however ( e.g. @xmath53 cen @xcite , m15 @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   the theory applies only when sufficient time has elapsed for achieving a balance between the energy produced in the cusp and the flow of energy across the half - mass radius . in almost all galactic nuclei , and even in many globular clusters @xcite , the relaxation time would be too long for the conditions assumed in this letter to be established .",
    "4 .   the theory does not apply to systems where some other mechanism , e.g. interactions of primordial binaries , provide energy more efficiently .",
    "it does not apply to systems that are so dense ( including many galactic nuclei ) that the structure of the cusp is dominated by the role of physical collisions , and the power law is altered @xcite .",
