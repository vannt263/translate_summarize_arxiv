    "quantum cavity optomechanics  @xcite deals with the physics of a mechanical element coupled to the light field of an optical resonator by radiation forces in the quantum regime . in the simplest and most",
    "commonly used model a single mechanical harmonic oscillator is coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity by radiation pressure interaction being proportional to the light intensity .",
    "the prototype of an optomechanical setup is a fabry - perot cavity with pendular end - mirror , whose microfabricated realization  @xcite , but also other implementations  @xcite , have been developed in the laboratories worldwide .",
    "the optomechanical coupling allows for optical control of the mechanical object , manifesting itself in strongly modified mechanical properties what ultimately can lead to laser cooling  @xcite towards the mechanical ground state , as has been demonstrated in a certain setup  @xcite , marking a requisite milestone on the way to quantum applications .    for typical realizations ,",
    "the optomechanical coupling is clearly smaller than the mechanical frequency . in such a regime ,",
    "laser cooling can be considered as a consequence of raman scattering of photons with stokes- and anti - stokes events , where a single vibrational quantum is deposited or taken away with the scattered photon .",
    "these processes play the central role in the cooling dynamics , similar as in the lamb - dicke regime of laser cooling of atoms .",
    "when anti - stokes scattering prevails , the mechanical system is cooled .",
    "the balance between stokes- and anti - stokes scattering can be adjusted by the laser parameters and for resolved sideband cooling , when the cavity s linewidth is smaller than the mechanical frequency @xmath0 , the pump laser optimally has to be detuned to the red side of the cavity resonance by @xmath0 .",
    "the optomechanical coupling strength is typically even so weak , that cooling with single photons turns out to be much too slow to overcome the rethermalization rate due to the coupling with the mechanical element s environment at cryogenic or even room temperature . to overcome this obstacle , in many setups a strong pump laser is used to effectively boost the optomechanical interaction . beyond that , more sophisticated cooling schemes are based on pulsed pump schemes exploiting interference effects  @xcite , or dynamically controlled cavity dissipation  @xcite in order to improve the cooling efficiency .",
    "short optical pulses can also be used for state preparation and reconstruction  @xcite , and modulated driving allows for the generation of squeezed quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the modulation of the mechanical frequency was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the result that squeezing and entanglement are enhanced in an resonant manner when the modulation frequency is twice the mechanical frequency , while the mean vibrational occupation number is simultaneously increased .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the behavior of laser cooling when the mechanical frequency and the mechanical damping is varied in time .",
    "this investigation was motivated by the recent experimental work  @xcite using dielectric membranes oscillatingly mounted inside a fabry - perot cavity . by local heating of the membrane with the help of a laser beam , both the resonance frequency of a vibrational mode and the linewidth",
    "can be altered in a controlled way .",
    "we extend the theory of optomechanical cooling to include modulations of the mechanical frequency in an adiabatic way and compare the predictions with numerical results .",
    "moreover , we discuss how the modulated damping rates influences the cooling behaviour .",
    "we find that in the resolved sideband limit and for strong periodic modulations , additional cooling resonances appear . for weaker modulations or larger cavity linewidths",
    "these resonances overlap and with the help of different pulse shapes , the form of the resulting resonances can be influenced .",
    "moreover , we systematically scan a large range of modulation parameters and discuss the cooling behavior in the various regimes .",
