    "in recent years , many efforts have been made to understand the effect of breakup of weakly bound nuclei during the fusion reaction in very asymmetric reactions where the capture cross section is equal to the complete fusion cross section  @xcite .",
    "the light radioactive nuclei , especially halo nuclei , such as @xmath3he , @xmath4b , @xmath5be , and the stable nuclei @xmath6li and @xmath7be are weakly bounded , hence there is a chance of the breakup in the colliding process . by performing a comparison of fusion data with theoretical predictions which do not take into account the dynamic breakup plus transfer channel effects , it has been shown  @xcite , that for energies from about @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the height of the coulomb barrier ) complete fusion in the reactions @xmath6li+@xmath11pb,@xmath12bi and @xmath7be+@xmath13y,@xmath14sn,@xmath11pb,@xmath12bi is suppressed by about 30% .",
    "however , the @xmath7be+@xmath15sm data is out of the systematics , showing a much smaller suppression of about 15% . the total fusion ( incomplete fusion + sequential complete fusion + complete fusion ) cross section for the same projectiles on targets of any mass , including @xmath7be + @xmath16al,@xmath17zn , does not seem to be affected by the dynamic breakup and transfer effects  @xcite . as the charge of the target decreases , one expects that the coulomb breakup becomes weaker , and consequently the complete fusion suppression and incomplete fusion probability decrease .",
    "the lack of a clear systematic behavior of the complete fusion suppression as a function of the target charge was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite by different effects of the transfer channels on the complete fusion and by some problems with the experimental data analysis .    in the present article",
    "we try to reveal a systematic behavior of the complete fusion suppression as a function of the target charge @xmath18 and colliding energy @xmath19 by using the quantum diffusion approach  @xcite and by comparing the calculated capture cross sections in the absence of breakup with the experimental complete and total fusion cross sections .",
    "the effects of deformation and neutron transfer on the complete fusion are taken into consideration .",
    "in the quantum diffusion approach  @xcite the collision of nuclei is described with a single relevant collective variable : the relative distance between the colliding nuclei .",
    "this approach takes into account the fluctuation and dissipation effects in collisions of heavy ions which model the coupling with various channels ( for example , coupling of the relative motion with low - lying collective modes such as dynamical quadrupole and octupole modes of the target and projectile nuclei  @xcite ) .",
    "we like to mention that many quantum - mechanical and non - markovian effects accompanying the passage through the potential barrier are considered in our formalism  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear deformation effects are taken into account through the dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential on the deformations and mutual orientations of the colliding nuclei . to calculate the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential @xmath20 , we use the procedure presented in refs .  @xcite . for the nuclear part of the nucleus - nucleus potential , a double - folding formalism with a skyrme - type density - dependent effective nucleon - nucleon interaction",
    "is used . within this approach",
    "many heavy - ion capture reactions with stable and radioactive beams at energies above and well below the coulomb barrier have been successfully described  @xcite .",
    "one should note that other diffusion models , which include the quantum statistical effects , were also proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the sub - barrier capture mainly depends on the optimal one - neutron ( @xmath21 ) or two - neutron ( @xmath22 ) transfer with a positive @xmath23-value .",
    "our assumption is that , just before the projectile is captured by the target - nucleus ( just before the crossing of the coulomb barrier ) which is a slow process , the transfer occurs that can lead to the population of the first excited collective state in the recipient nucleus  @xcite .",
    "so , the motion to the @xmath24 equilibrium starts in the system before the capture because it is energetically favorable in the dinuclear system in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier .",
    "for the reactions under consideration , the average change of mass asymmetry is connected to the one- or two - neutron transfer . since after the transfer the mass numbers , the isotopic composition and the deformation parameters of the interacting nuclei , and , correspondingly , the height @xmath25 and shape of the coulomb barrier are changed , one can expect an enhancement or suppression of the capture . when the isotopic dependence of the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential is weak and the deformations of the interacting nuclei",
    "after the transfer have not changed , there is no effect of the neutron transfer on the capture cross section .",
    "this scenario was verified in the description of many reactions in ref .",
    "all calculated results are obtained with the same set of parameters as in ref .",
    "we use the friction coefficient in the relative distance coordinate which is close to that calculated within the mean field approaches  @xcite .",
    "the absolute values of the quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath26 of even - even deformed nuclei are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the nuclei deformed in the ground state ,",
    "the @xmath26 in the first excited collective state is similar to the @xmath26 in the ground state . for the quadruple deformation parameter of an odd nucleus ,",
    "we choose the maximal value of the deformation parameters of neighboring even - even nuclei . for the double magic and neighboring nuclei , in the ground state we set @xmath27 .",
    "there are uncertainties in the definition of the values of @xmath26 in light - mass nuclei .",
    "however , these uncertainties weakly influence the capture cross sections in the asymmetric reactions treated . in the calculations for light nuclei we use @xmath26 from ref .",
    "@xcite .      in figs .",
    "1 - 13 we compare the calculated @xmath28 capture cross sections with the experimental @xmath29 complete and total fusion cross sections in the reactions induced by projectiles @xmath7be , @xmath30b , @xmath0li , @xmath31he @xcite .",
    "the difference between the capture cross section and the complete fusion cross section can be ascribed to the breakup effect . comparing @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ", one can estimate the breakup probability @xmath32 if at some energy @xmath33 , the values of @xmath28 was normalized so to have @xmath34 at any energy .",
    "note that @xmath35 contains the contribution from two processes : the direct fusion of the projectile with the target ( @xmath36 ) , and the breakup of the projectile followed by the fusion of the two projectile fragments with the target ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "a more adequate estimate of the breakup probability would then be : @xmath38 which leads to larger values of @xmath39 than the expression employed by us .",
    "however , the ratio between @xmath36 and @xmath37 can not be measured experimentally , but can be estimated with the approach suggested in refs .",
    "the parameters of the potential are taken to fit the height of the coulomb barrier obtained in our calculations .",
    "the parameters of the breakup function @xcite are set to describe the value of @xmath29 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and in our calculations , in the @xmath4be+@xmath11pb reaction the fraction of @xmath37 in @xmath29 does not exceed few percents at @xmath404 mev .",
    "this fraction rapidly increases and reaches about 1220% , depending on the reaction , at @xmath4110 mev .",
    "because we are mainly interested in the energies near and below the barrier , the estimated @xmath37 does not exceed 20% of @xmath29 at @xmath4210 mev .",
    "the results for @xmath39 are presented taking @xmath36 into account in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    as seen in figs .",
    "14 and 15 , at energies above the coulomb barriers the values of @xmath39 vary from 0 to 84% . in the reactions",
    "@xmath43be+@xmath15sm,@xmath11pb,@xmath12bi the value of @xmath39 increases with charge number of the target at @xmath44 mev .",
    "this was also noted in ref .",
    "however , the reactions @xmath43be+@xmath13y,@xmath14sn are out of this systematics . in the reactions @xmath3li+@xmath15sm,@xmath45pt,@xmath12bi the value of @xmath39 decreases with increasing charge number of the target at @xmath44 mev .",
    "while in the reactions @xmath43be+@xmath13y,@xmath15sm,@xmath11pb,@xmath12bi the value of @xmath39 has a minimum at @xmath46 and a maximum at @xmath47 mev , in the @xmath43be+@xmath14sn reaction the value of @xmath39 steady decreases with energy . in the reactions @xmath3li+@xmath15sm,@xmath45pt,@xmath12bi , @xmath48li+@xmath11pb,@xmath12bi , and",
    "@xmath43li+@xmath11pb there is maximum of @xmath39 at @xmath49 mev .",
    "however , in the reactions @xmath3li+@xmath11pb and @xmath48li+@xmath50ho @xmath39 has a minima @xmath51 mev and no maxima at @xmath46 . for @xmath43be ,",
    "the breakup threshold is slightly larger than for @xmath3li .",
    "therefore , we can not explain a larger breakup probability at smaller @xmath52 in the case of @xmath43be .    in figs .  1 - 13 we also show the calculated capture cross sections normalized by some factors to obtain a rather good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results",
    ". these average normalization factors are 0.7 , 0.75 , 0.9 , 0.64 , 0.7 , 1 , 0.9 for the reactions @xmath43be+@xmath12bi,@xmath11pb,@xmath15sm,@xmath14sn,@xmath13y,@xmath17zn,@xmath16al , respectively , 0.52 , 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.42 , 0.65 for the reactions @xmath3li+@xmath12bi,@xmath11pb,@xmath45pt,@xmath15sm,@xmath17zn , respectively , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.65 , 0.6 , 0.65 , 0.75 for the reactions @xmath48li+@xmath12bi,@xmath53au,@xmath50ho,@xmath54tb,@xmath17zn,@xmath16al , respectively . for the reactions @xmath43li+@xmath11pb ( fig .",

    "13 ) and @xmath5b+@xmath54 tb ( fig .",
    "13 ) , a satisfactory agreement between experimental fusion data and capture cross sections can be reached with average normalization factors 0.6 , 0.68 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 0.7 , 0.82 , and 0.95 , respectively .",
    "note that these average normalization factors do not depend on @xmath19 . with the @xmath7be projectile",
    "we obtain the complete fusion suppressions similar to those reported in refs .  @xcite . for lighter targets ,",
    "when the coulomb breakup becomes weaker , one expects that the suppression of complete fusion becomes smaller than for heavy targets .",
    "an expected behavior for complete fusion suppression is that fusion probability increases with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "however , one can observe deviations from this rule . in the reactions",
    "@xmath7be+@xmath14sn,@xmath13y the data show quite larger complete fusion suppression ( 3036)% . for the reactions induced by a @xmath55li projectile , one can see that the fusion suppression is nearly independent of @xmath18 .",
    "the replacement of @xmath57li by @xmath55li in the reactions in fig .",
    "9 almost does not change the experimental  @xcite and calculated data .",
    "the coulomb fields for very light systems @xmath43be+@xmath16al , and @xmath3he,@xmath48li+@xmath17zn are not strong enough to produce an appreciable breakup .",
    "it is not realistic that the fusion suppression in the @xmath43be+@xmath17zn reaction is smaller than the one in the @xmath43be+@xmath16al reaction or the suppressions of fusion coincide in the reactions @xmath58he+@xmath17zn ( fig .",
    "11 ) with stable and exotic projectiles .",
    "note that the experimental data for the reactions @xmath6li+@xmath16al,@xmath17zn and @xmath7be+@xmath16al,@xmath59zn are for the total fusion .",
    "in general , the total fusion does not seem to be affected by breakup  @xcite .",
    "so , there is a lack of a systematic behavior of the complete fusion suppression for the systems treated .",
    "the possible explanation of it is that there are probably some problems with the data analysis which were earlier noted in refs .",
    "@xcite from the point of view of a universal fusion function representation .",
    "it could be also that at energies near the coulomb barrier the characteristic time of the breakup is larger than the characteristic time of the capture process and influences the complete fusion .",
    "for the reactions @xmath6li+@xmath11pb , the characteristic times of the prompt and delayed breakup were studied recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the large positive @xmath60-value in the @xmath43li+@xmath11pb reaction  @xcite gives a possibility of a two - neutron transfer before the capture .",
    "however , the capture cross sections calculated with and without neutron transfer are very close to each other because the effect of neutron transfer is rather weak in asymmetric reactions  @xcite . the calculated capture",
    "cross sections normalized by a factor of 0.6 are shown by the dotted line in the lower part of fig .",
    "10 . in the upper part of fig .",
    "10 , the predicted capture cross sections for the reaction @xmath5li+@xmath11pb are shown .",
    "the lack of a clear systematic behavior of the complete fusion suppression as a function of the target charge requires new additional experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the quasielastic backscattering has been used  @xcite as an alternative to investigate fusion ( capture ) barrier distributions , since this process is complementary to fusion . since the quasielastic experiment is usually not as complex as the capture ( fusion ) and breakup measurements , they are well suited to survey the breakup probability .",
    "there is a direct relationship between the capture , the quasielastic scattering and the breakup processes , since any loss from the quasielastic and breakup channel contributes directly to capture ( the conservation of the reaction flux ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the reflection quasielastic probability , @xmath63 is the breakup ( reflection ) probability , and @xmath64 is the capture ( transmission ) probability .",
    "the quasielastic scattering is the sum of all direct reactions , which include elastic , inelastic , and transfer processes .",
    "equation  ( 3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the quasielastic and capture probabilities , respectively , in the absence of the breakup process . from these expressions",
    "we obtain the useful formulas @xmath68 using eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) , we obtain the relationship between breakup and quasielastic processes : @xmath69=1-p_{qe}(e_{\\rm c.m.},j)[1 + 1/a ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-p_{qe}(e_{\\rm c.m.},j)/p_{qe}^{nbu}(e_{\\rm c.m.},j).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation is one of important results of the present paper .",
    "analogously one can find other expression @xmath70 which relates the breakup and capture processes .    the reflection quasielastic probability @xmath71 for bombarding energy @xmath19 and angular momentum @xmath72",
    "is given by the ratio of the quasielastic differential cross section @xmath73 and rutherford differential cross section @xmath74 at 180 degrees  @xcite . employing eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 8) , and the experimental quasielastic backscattering data with toughly and weakly bound isotopes - projectiles and the same compound nucleus , one can extract the breakup probability of the exotic nucleus .",

    "one concludes that the quasielastic technique could be a very important tool in breakup research .",
    "we propose to extract the breakup probability directly from the quasielastic cross sections of systems mentioned above .",
    "comparing the calculated capture cross sections in the absence of breakup data and experimental complete fusion data , we analyzed the role of the breakup channels in the reactions with the light projectiles @xmath7be , @xmath0li and @xmath2he at near - barrier energies . within the quantum diffusion approach",
    "the neutron transfer and deformation effects were taken into account . analyzing the extracted breakup probabilities",
    ", we showed that there are no systematic trends of breakup in the reactions studied .",
    "moreover , for some system with larger ( smaller ) @xmath18 we found the contribution of breakup to be smaller ( larger ) . almost for all reactions considered we obtained a satisfactory agreement between calculated",
    "capture cross section and experimental fusion data , if the calculated capture cross section or the experimental fusion data are renormalized by some average factor which does not depend on the bombarding energy .",
