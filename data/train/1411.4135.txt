    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are off - nuclear point x - ray sources in nearby galaxies with isotropic luminosities @xmath11 @xmath12 erg  s@xmath9 ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . since their discovery more than 30 years ago",
    "@xcite , the true nature of ulxs has remained a mystery .",
    "early _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations revealed that most ulxs should contain accreting black holes @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a firm upper limit of @xmath13 @xmath14 on the mass of a black hole in a ulx suggesting that most ulxs are indeed stellar - mass black holes .",
    "however , discovery of x - ray pulsations @xcite in one of the ulxs in m82 galaxy suggests that ulxs may also be powered by accretion onto magnetized neutron stars . in ulxs ,",
    "mass estimates of the compact objects remain highly debatable because no dynamical measurement has been possible yet .",
    "however , recent optical / uv observations reveal that ulxs in m101 @xcite and ngc 7793 @xcite harbour stellar - mass black holes .",
    "since luminosities of ulxs exceed the eddington rate for a 10 @xmath14 black hole , it has been suggested that ulxs might harbour intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) with mass in the range @xmath15 @xmath14 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "other popular models proposed to explain the ultraluminous nature of ulxs are : ( 1 ) normal x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) accreting at super - eddington rate @xcite , ( 2 ) xrbs accreting at sub - eddington rate with beamed emission @xcite .",
    "however , the beaming scenario suffers from several difficulties , e.g , a lack of evidence of radio jets in ulxs ( see @xcite ) and the presence of a strong qpo in m82 x-1 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a new accretion state named the _ ultraluminous state _ implying a super - eddington accretion rate for ulxs .",
    "based on the early observations with _ xmm - newton _ , some ulx spectra ( 0.3 - 10.0 kev ) were modelled with a simple phenomenological model ( i.e. , disc emission and power - law component ; @xcite ) with a characteristic disc temperature of @xmath6 @xmath4 0.1 - 0.5 kev .",
    "the presence of a cool disk component and very high luminosities , which indeed triggered the hypothesis that ulxs may contain a imbh , may not be a valid prescription to explain most of the x - ray observational features .",
    "recent studies ( see , @xcite for details ) showed that the energy spectra can be well described by an optically thick corona ( @xmath16 , whereas @xmath17 for corona seen in galactic black hole binaries ) coupled with an accretion disc .",
    "in addition , the presence of a high - energy curvature ( @xmath18 kev ) , not seen in galactic black hole binaries @xcite accreting at a sub - eddington rate , is now considered as one of the ulx spectral signatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , combining both spectral and temporal variabilities , @xcite classified three spectral regimes for ulxs , namely _ broadened disc _ , _ hard ultraluminous _ and _ soft ultraluminous _ class .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated a larger sample of observations for studying the spectral evolution with a different approach ( i.e. , based on _ colour - colour _ and _ hardness - intensity diagram _",
    "analysis ) .",
    "all these studies further corroborate the idea of a new accretion state ( i.e. , _ ultraluminous state _ ) for ulxs @xcite .",
    "the study of short - term variability may also put constraints on the various accretion models in ulxs ( see @xcite ) . in a few ulxs ( m82 x-1 , ngc 5408 x-1 , ngc 6946 x-1 , m82 x42.3 + 59 ) , qpos",
    "have been detected in the frequency range of @xmath4 3 mhz to 200 mhz @xcite .",
    "a qpo around 200 mhz has been reported in holmberg x-1 @xcite , but was not confirmed later ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported twin - peak qpos in m82 x-1 at frequencies of 3.32 and 5.07 hz .",
    "several ulxs show the short - term variability with ( or without ) the presence of qpos in the power spectra , whereas the variability is found to be completely suppressed in some sources @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the short - term variability in the ultraluminous state can be produced by variable obscuration due to clumpy winds ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ic 342 x-1 is a ulx in the nearby spiral galaxy ic 342 at a distance of 3.3 mpc @xcite .",
    "the source was discovered by the _",
    "einstein _ satellite @xcite .",
    "this source was also detected by _",
    "rosat _ in the ultra - luminous state @xcite .",
    "_ asca _ observations of the source taken during 1993 and 2000 revealed spectral transitions from a high / soft to a low / hard spectrum @xcite .",
    "the analysis carried out using _ suzaku _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ swift _ revealed two different power - law ( pl ) states in this source @xcite : low - luminosity pl state and high luminosity pl state .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a clear change in a recent _ chandra _ spectrum with a much softer spectrum than seen in all previous observations and it has been modelled with a standard accretion disc emission .",
    "the source has also been detected in radio using vla , but the presence of a compact radio jet was not confirmed in the high spatial resolution data as observed with vlbi @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the recent quasi - simultaneous observations of ic 342 x-1 made by _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ in august 2012 .",
    "recently , @xcite also analysed the same data sets in order to understand the broadband spectral nature of the source . from our detailed analysis",
    "( see  2 &  3 ) , we report the detection of qpo in ic 342 x-1 along with the spectral properties of the source .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed ic 342 x-1 six ( 6 ) times between 2001 and 2012 .",
    "we use the data obtained on 2012 august 11 with an exposure time of 55 ks ( obs-1 ) and on 2012 august 17 for a total exposure of 50 ks ( obs-2 ) . the previous data sets ( i.e. , initial four observations )",

    "we find that the above filtering process removes the large background flares at the end of the observations .",
    "we also observe that the filtering process produces two data gaps of 500  s and 300  s in the lightcurves of obs-1 corresponding to two short flares and * a * 300  s data gap in the lightcurves of obs-2 .    the task _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ are used to create response matrix file ( rmf ) and ancillary response file ( arf ) .",

    "the background subtracted lightcurves of ic 342 x-1 observed with _ xmm - newton _ at two different epochs ( obs-1 & obs-2 ) are shown in figure 1 with effective exposure times ( resulted after removing the high background intervals ) of 43.5 ksec and 37.5 ksec respectively .",
    "the average count rate for obs-1 is @xmath24 and that for obs-2 is @xmath25 .",

    "we use a binsize of 0.220 s ( 3 times the temporal resolution ) to construct the pds .",

    "the pds in the 0.3 - 5.0 kev range shows qpo at 653 mhz ( fig .",
    "however , no qpo is observed in the 5.0 - 10.0 kev power spectrum ( fig .",
    "we fit the pds in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev and 0.3 - 5.0 kev bands ( for obs-1 ) with a model composed of a lorentzian for a qpo peak , a power - law ( ae@xmath26 , @xmath27 = 1.5 @xmath28 0.8 for the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band , @xmath27 = 1.95 @xmath28 0.9 for the 0.3 - 5.0 kev band ) and a constant to account for the poissonian noise .",
    "we get @xmath29 = 1.02 ( @xmath30 ) for the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band and @xmath29 = 1.06 ( @xmath31 ) for the 0.3 - 5.0 kev band .",
    "the resultant fits are shown in fig .",
    "2a and fig .",
    "2b respectively .",
    "fitting the power spectra ( obs-1 ) in the 0.3 - 10 kev and 0.3 - 5.0 kev bands with a power - law and a constant gives @xmath29 = 1.51 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath29 = 1.57 ( @xmath33 ) respectively .",
    "so , overall fitting is improved upon considering the lorentzian component for the qpo feature .",
    "fitting the power spectra of obs-2 in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev and 0.3 - 5.0 kev bands with a power - law and a constant gives @xmath29 = 1.22 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath29 = 1.02 ( @xmath35 ) respectively .",
    "we note that no lorentzian component is required to improve the fit of the pds of obs-2 in both energy bands ( see fig .",
    "2d , 2e ) .",
    "we also note that the pds in the 5.0 - 10.0 kev energy bands for both observations ( obs-1 and obs-2 ) are featureless and can be fitted with a constant to account for the poissonian noise ( see fig . 2c , 2f ) .",
    "the significance of the qpo parameters in both bands are estimated with f - test statistics .",
    "the best fit model in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band gives a qpo of centroid frequency @xmath0 mhz , a q - factor ( @xmath36 ) = 11.6 and an amplitude ( rms ) of 4.1% with significance of 3.6@xmath37 .",
    "the best fit qpo parameters in the 0.3 - 5.0 kev band are centroid frequency @xmath38 mhz , q - factor = 9.8 and amplitude ( rms ) of 4.5% .",
    "the qpo in the 0.3 - 5.0 kev band is detected with a significance of 3.7@xmath37 .",
    "the total integrated power ( 0.01 - 2.5 hz ) is @xmath4 7.2% in the energy band of 0.3 - 10.0 kev for obs-1 and 3.2% for obs-2 .",
    "all errors quoted are computed using @xmath39 .    note that considering the time interval ( obs-1 ) before the short flares results in 36.5 ks continuous observation .",
    "the pds created using this exposure time ( 36.5 ks ) shows a qpo feature with similar parameters .",
    "however , the significance of the qpo changes from 3.6 to 3.4@xmath37 .",
    "the energy spectra of epic - pn and _ nustar / fpma _ are analysed using xspec version 12.8.1 .",
    "we fit the combined epic - pn ( 0.3 - 10.0 kev band ; obs-1 ) and _ nustar_/fpma ( 3.0 - 40.0 kev ; 2012 august 10 ) data ( epoch-1 ) with : 1 ) _ power - law _ , 2 ) power - law with exponential cutoff ( _ cutoffpl _ in xspec ) , 3 ) _ cutoffpl _ with an addition of multi - temperature disk component for the standard thin accretion disk ( _ diskbb _ in xspec ; @xcite ) , 4 ) _ diskbb _ plus comptonization model ( _ comptt _ model of xspec ; @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the _ tbabs _ model @xcite for all the spectral models in order to model the extinction ( @xmath40 ) on the line of sight to the source .",
    "similarly , the second quasi - simultaneous data ( epoch-2 ) obtained with epic - pn ( 0.3 - 10.0 kev ; obs-2 ) and _ nustar_/fpma ( 3.0 - 40.0 kev ; 2012 august 16 ) are also analyzed and fitted with above mentioned models .",
    "the cross - calibration constant between _",
    "nustar / fpma _ and _ xmm - newton / epic - pn _ is found to be close to 1 ( @xmath4 0.95 ) .",
    "the best fit parameters for all the models are listed in table 1 .",
    "all errors quoted are computed using @xmath39 ( at 68% confidence ) .",
    "the @xmath40 values are found to be in the range of 0.5 - 0.7 @xmath7 10@xmath41 @xmath42(see table 1 ) .",

    "the probability that the fit is improved by chance is 1.59 @xmath7 10@xmath46 .",
    "hence a simple _ power - law _",
    "model is not the best description of the data and the spectrum shows a clear high energy cutoff . since * a",
    "* soft excess modelled with the _ diskbb _ has been observed in many ulxs @xcite , we fitted the epoch-1 spectrum with the _",

    "the fit results in @xmath47 ( @xmath44 = 634/640 ) and chance improvement probability equals to 1.12@xmath7 10@xmath48 for inclusion of the _ diskbb _ component , suggesting that a soft excess component below 2 kev is required to improve the fit .",
    "analysis of xmm - newton data of several ulxs revealed that the disc emission plus cool ( @xmath49 3 kev ) and optically thick ( @xmath50 5 - 30 ) comptonized component models the spectral data well @xcite .",
    "hence , we tried with the _ comptt _ model also instead of _ cutoffpl_. the combination of _ diskbb _ plus _ comptt _ model , where the seed photon temperature is tied to the inner disc temperature , gives @xmath51 ( @xmath44 = 645/640 ) .",
    "hence , the _ diskbb+cutoffpl _ model is the best description for the epoch-1 observation .",
    "epoch-2 data can also be well modelled with the _",
    "diskbb+cutoffpl _ model resulting in @xmath52 ( @xmath44 = 729/699 ) .",
    "the disc temperature is 0.33 @xmath28 0.03 kev and 0.47 @xmath28 0.06 kev respectively for the epoch-1 and epoch-2 data .",
    "the _ diskbb _",
    "normalization is found to be unphysically small for both spectra .",
    "the cutoff energy ( @xmath5 ) is 7.92 @xmath28 0.91 kev and 7.27 @xmath28 0.99 kev respectively for epoch-1 and epoch-2 spectra ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the _ diskbb+cutoffpl _ model is the best description of the spectra , the _ diskbb+comptt _ model also provides statistically good description of the spectra for both epochs .",
    "the best fit optical depth ( @xmath53 ) and electron temperature ( @xmath54 ) for the epoch-1 spectrum are 13.32 @xmath28 0.66 and 3.35 @xmath28 0.17 kev respectively .",
    "the best fit @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the epoch-2 are 12.31 @xmath28 0.41 and 3.29 @xmath28 0.15 kev respectively .    in table 1",
    ", we also give the estimated unabsorbed total flux in 0.1 - 100.0 kev band and corresponding luminosities for all the models using a distance of 3.3 mpc .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes and corresponding errors are computed using the convolution model _",
    "cflux _ of xspec .",
    "in the present work , we report the discovery of a qpo in the _ xmm - newton _ data of the ulx source ic 342 x-1 , a system harbouring a black hole ( see @xcite ) . the detection of a peak at @xmath4 642 mhz ( q @xmath4 11.6 , rms @xmath4 4.1% and significance @xmath2 ) in the power spectrum of ic 342 x-1 ( obs-1 ) could be used to constrain the mass of the ` hole ' as this technique was employed for other ulxs @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the qpo detection in ic 342 x-1 is also the highest frequency observed in a ulx to date , whereas the subsequent _ xmm - newton _ observation ( 6 days later ) does not show any signature of qpo like feature .",

    "diskbb _ plus a _ comptt _ model .",
    "the best fit model parameters indicate that the source was in a hard spectral state ( @xmath55 , @xmath53 @xmath4 13.32 , @xmath5 @xmath4 7.92 kev ) that is unlike the canonical hard state as commonly seen in galactic black hole binaries ( gbhbs ) .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of the source is found to be around @xmath56 erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "similar spectral features are also seen in the epoch-2 observation .",
    "all these observational results are consistent with the findings of @xcite and implies that the source could be in the hard ultraluminous state @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the power spectra of gbh sources are characterized by various broad noise components ( power - law like red noise , flat - top noise etc . ) along - with a narrow noise component ( i.e. lorentzian type for qpo like feature ) .",
    "the high temporal variability and low frequency qpos ( @xmath57 hz ) observed in bh sources are mostly associated with the hard or intermediate states .",
    "in general , the low frequency qpos seen in galactic bhs are classified as a , b and c type @xcite . as an example",
    ", the c - type qpo has a high q - factor ( 6 - 12 ) , a large amplitude ( 3% - 16% rms ) and shows complex phase lag behaviour along with flat - top noise component .",
    "moreover , the low frequency qpos evolve with the spectral states and completely disappear in the thermally dominated soft state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since the qpos scale inversely with the mass of a black hole in gbh sources @xcite ,",
    "the observed qpos can be used to infer the mass of the putative black hole .",
    "in contrast , the nature of the power spectra and short - term variability are more complex in ulxs @xcite .",
    "few sources show signature*s * of qpos without any change in the centroid qpo frequency ( except m82 x-1 , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the recent discovery of twin - peak x - ray qpos ( 3:2 frequency ratio ) in m82 x-1 is found to be stable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "no definite correlation exists between the qpos and spectral states in ulxs , but a defined correlation exists for most gbhbs . in the case of ic",
    "342 x-1 , the power spectrum of obs-1 can be modelled with a constant and a lorentzian feature ( for qpo ) along with a power - law component .",
    "the observed intrinsic variability is around @xmath58 .",
    "this form of pds is a common characteristic of ulxs ( see @xcite ) , where significant variability is observed and the power spectra are modelled with a power - law or with a broken power - law component .",
    "interestingly , the power spectrum of obs-2 ( 6 days later ) does not show any presence of a qpo but both observations ( obs-1 & obs-2 ) show similar spectral nature ( see table 1 ) .",
    "another important thing to note * is * that the hard x - ray energy spectra of gbhbs ( i.e. , hard or intermediates states ) have connection with the strong qpos and compact radio jets observed in the sources @xcite .",
    "the high energy spectral curvatures observed in gbhbs ( in the range of 30 - 100 kev ) are the manifestation of optically thin corona with characteristic temperature of @xmath59 kev ( @xcite ) . however , in ulxs the spectral nature is quite different with spectral curvature of electron temperature of few kev and optical depth in the range of 5 to 30 ( thick corona ) . also , the connection between the hard x - ray spectral nature , the qpos and compact jets is not well established in ulxs .",
    "so , it is hard to compare the spectral nature of ulxs with that of gbhbs .    since the characteristic time - scale of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or a gbh scales with the compact object mass ( mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ) , one can raise the following basic question - could the observed qpo in ic 342 x-1 be analogous to any type of qpos observed in galactic black holes ? there have been several attempts to identify the qpos seen in ulxs @xcite with those seen in gbhbs .",
    "however , the classification of qpos observed in ulxs remains unclear @xcite .",
    "the detection of 642 mhz qpo in ic 342 x-1 which shows some of the characteristics ( q - factor = 11.6 and rms = 4.1% ) of c - type qpo , can be used to constrain the black hole mass in ic 342 x-1 .",
    "however , true classification requires phase lag study which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the heaviest galactic bh source grs 1915 + 105 @xcite shows c - type qpos in the frequency range 1 - 3 hz . if we consider that the 642 mhz qpo is a scaled - down version of the qpos seen in grs 1915 + 10 along with the assumption that the qpo frequencies scale inversely proportional to the bh masses @xcite , then we can estimate the black hole mass in ic 342 x-1 as @xmath60 ( considering the mass of grs 1915 + 105 @xmath4 14 @xmath61 ) .",
    "it implies that for the bolometric luminosity @xmath56 erg  s@xmath9 , the black hole at the centre of ic 342 x-1 is accreting matter at near - eddington rate ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "another possibility for estimating the mass of the black hole in ic 342 x-1 is to consider the observed qpo as a scaled - down version of those hfqpos which are observed in gbhbs ( eg .",
    "65 - 67 hz in grs 1915 + 105 ; see @xcite ; 66 hz in igr j17091 - 3624 ; see @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    ", the estimated mass could be in the range of @xmath63 ( considering the mass of grs 1915 + 105 @xmath4 14 @xmath28 4 @xmath61 ) .",
    "it would imply that the central black hole accretes matter at sub - eddington rate ( 0.02 - 0.05 @xmath64 )",
    ". this may not be the case for ic 342 x-1 , as the observed spectral properties favour the _ hard ultraluminous state _ of ulxs , explained by a system harbouring a stellar - mass black hole accreting at and above the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "we are then left with the possibility that the central ` hole ' of ic 342 x-1 might be harbouring a ` massive ' stellar - mass black hole of mass @xmath65 .",
    "the present stellar evolution models also predict massive bh remnants ( @xmath66 ) that could be formed from direct collapse of the progenitor without any supernova explosion @xcite .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) at 642 mhz in an _ xmm - newton _ observation of the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) ic 342 x-1 . </S>",
    "<S> the qpo has a centroid at @xmath0 mhz , a coherence factor of @xmath1 , and an amplitude ( rms ) of 4.1% with significance of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence study shows that the qpo is stronger in the energy range 0.3 - 5.0 kev . a subsequent observation ( 6 days later ) </S>",
    "<S> does not show any signature of the qpo in the power density spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the broadband energy spectra ( 0.3 - 40.0 kev ) obtained by quasi - simultaneous observations of _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ can be well described by an absorbed _ diskbb _ plus _ cutoffpl _ model . </S>",
    "<S> the best fitted spectral parameters are power - law index ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 1.1 , cutoff energy ( @xmath5 ) @xmath4 7.9 kev and disc temperature ( @xmath6 ) @xmath4 0.33 kev , where the qpo is detected . </S>",
    "<S> the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity is @xmath4 5.34@xmath7 10@xmath8 erg  s@xmath9 . comparing with the well known x - ray binary grs 1915 + 105 , our results are consistent with the mass of the compact object in ic 342 x-1 being in the range @xmath10 . </S>",
