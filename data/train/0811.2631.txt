    "the electron - phonon ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) interaction in quantum dots ( qds ) is evaluated theoretically by invoking the discontinuous dielectric property ( between qds and substrate ) and quantum adiabatic approximation in order to understand the coupling between electrons in qds and the phonons in both qds and substrate . in order to do so ,",
    "we propose here that the elemental composition of the qds and the substrate need to be explicitly considered .",
    "we further show that such consideration will lead us to understand the dephasing mechanisms in qds accurately for any non - free - electron qds and substrate .",
    "apparently , ( 1 ) the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction within the qds and ( 2 ) between qds and the substrate are crucial to the understanding of the dephasing mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "pure dephasing process is defined as due to the elastic interaction between electrons and phonons that only further corrects the unperturbed energy levels in qds .",
    "such a process does not excite the electrons or change the excited carrier density or the carrier occupation numbers  @xcite . whereas , inelastic dephasing requires phonons to assist the electrons and/or holes to be relaxed to a lower energy - level , or electron relaxation due to phonon emission  @xcite .",
    "both pure- and inelastic - dephasing processes hinder the storage of quantum information , which are characterized by the timescales , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively  @xcite",
    ". the respective @xmath2 and @xmath3 timescales are also known as the phase and population relaxation lifetimes .",
    "presently , there are several theories on these dephasing processes and are given in the refs .",
    "@xcite that employ the adiabatic approximation . in those treatments",
    "however , the adiabaticity is invoked between the nuclear motion and the electronic excitation with respect to degeneracies , without incorporating the phonons from the substrate  @xcite .",
    "apart from that , a polaronic model based on the polaron relaxation was proposed to understand the relaxation mechanisms in qds  @xcite , which employs the approach of klemens , barman and srivastava  @xcite . in their study , only fr@xmath4hlich polarons or the electron - lo(longitudinal optical ) phonon interaction was considered .",
    "this model is an improved version of other reported relaxation models , namely , ( 1 ) the semi - classical approach  @xcite and ( 2 ) a phenomenological model that invoked the anharmonic mechanism for the bulk lo phonons within the fermi golden rule framework  @xcite . in all these approaches , ( 1 )",
    "the origin of phonons is from the qds , where the lo phonon contributions from the substrate or wetting layer are ignored by assuming the substrate phonons are the low - energy acoustic phonons , and ( 2 ) the phonons are independent of elemental composition .    here",
    ", we take another step forward to understand the influence of substrate phonons ( both acoustic and optical ) on qds dephasing mechanisms ( both pure and inelastic ) in detail .",
    "the influence of substrate phonons will be captured by studying the elemental compositions in qd and substrate materials separately .",
    "we will invoke the ionization energy theory ( iet ) to analyze how different elemental compositions in qds and substrate will give rise to pure or inelastic dephasing processes or both .",
    "the reasons for incorporating the elemental compositions in qds and substrate are ( 1 ) to investigate the reports that claim the matrix and/or substrate are indeed influencing both the electronic and phononic properties of the qds  @xcite , and ( 2 ) to develop a strategy based on the iet to distinguish the contradicting results obtained by sanguinetti et al .",
    "@xcite and others : zibik et al .",
    "@xcite and chernikov et al .",
    "for example , pure dephasing was found to be responsible in gaas qds on al@xmath5ga@xmath6as substrate  @xcite . whereas , inelastic dephasing played the major role in inas qds embedded in the gaas matrix  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our primary intention here is to understand why and how different constituent atoms in qds and substrate materials may contribute to the different electronic relaxation or dephasing mechanisms in qds .    in order to achieve this",
    ", we will employ the iet , which has been developed earlier  @xcite .",
    "the reason to use the iet is because the theory is straightforward and the physical mechanisms derived from the iet can be directly related to the atomic constituents of any non - free - electron systems  @xcite .",
    "we organize the paper in the following order . a brief introduction to the iet",
    "is given in the following section .",
    "subsequently , technical discussion are developed on the technique of isolating the qds from its substrate .",
    "the qds are first electronically isolated and followed by adiabatic isolation",
    ". detailed discussion on experimental proofs and the possible applications of the iet are highlighted with predictions .",
    "in addition , we also explain how the different dephasing rates due to defects , impurities , electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions , and spins are related to the ionization energy concept .",
    "we start from the many - body hamiltonian , which is given by  @xcite    @xmath7    where , the eigenvalue is exactly equals to @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the total energy of the system at zero temperature ( @xmath10 k ) , @xmath11 is the energy - level difference in a given atom or the ionization energy .",
    "importantly , the iet presented here can be used to study any non - free - electron materials . if a given material is a free - electron metal , then eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) reduces to the standard time - independent schr@xmath4dinger equation given by , @xmath12 , where one needs other theoretical and computational methods to solve it by means of variational principle  @xcite . for solids",
    "however , the parameter @xmath11 in the total energy , @xmath8 refers to the energy level differences in solids , which is difficult to be determined .",
    "therefore , we will use the ionization energy approximation , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the atomic ionization energy ( for an isolated or free atom ) .",
    "mathematically , the ionization energy approximation can be written as    @xmath15    where ,",
    "the subscript @xmath16 counts the first , second , ... , @xmath17 ionization energy of each constituent atom for a given material . here",
    ", @xmath18 gives the changes to the average ionization energy of a given system .",
    "in addition , in this approximation , one needs to rely on the accuracy of the ionic valence states of the constituent atoms and as such , knowing accurate valence state values are important , and usually , they are easily predictable . for example , these valence states can be obtained from their stable oxidation states and these states are also known to vary significantly as a result of defect - formation and/or other structural deformations  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we can substitute the new total energy , @xmath19 ( after the approximation ) into the ionization energy based fermi - dirac statistics  @xcite as given below    @xmath20/k_bt } + 1 } , \\nn \\\\ & & f_h(e_0,e_i ) = \\frac{1}{e^{[e_f^{(0 ) } - \\left(e_0 - e_i \\right)]/k_bt}+1}. \\label{eq:14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note here that for qds , @xmath21 can be regarded as the highest occupied energy - level at @xmath22 = 0 k , and @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the probability functions for electrons and holes , respectively . even though eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is for @xmath10 k , the temperature effect can be taken into account via eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "note here that the appearance of @xmath11 in any equations simply means that the ionization energy approximation has not been invoked .",
    "after applying the approximation , one must replace the @xmath11 with @xmath14 in all the equations .",
    "this approximation will be used later to calculate the average ionization energy of the elements present in a given qd .",
    "the size effect is easily obtained from a simple one - dimensional infinite square - well potential , which is given by  @xcite    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the width of the potential well and we can see the inverse proportionality between @xmath27 and @xmath11 , while @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the electronic mass , planck constant and the principal quantum number , respectively .",
    "importantly , @xmath14 is unique for each atom that will assist us to capture the effect of different constituent atoms in qd and substrates on their electronic excitation probability and the electron - phonon interaction . therefore , the only input parameter is the type of atoms or ions that may exist in a given sample , and their appropriate valence states .",
    "more details about the iet and its approximation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the subsequent sections",
    "however , we will use @xmath11 throughout instead of @xmath14 for notational clarity .",
    "thus , any values calculated for @xmath11 implies that we have invoked the ionization energy approximation .",
    "in the following sections , the electronic interaction between the arrays of qds and the substrate is evaluated with respect to the possibility of isolating the electronic property of qds from the substrate .",
    "after that , these qds are separately ( 1 ) coupled to qd and substrate phonons , and ( 2 ) isolated from those phonons adiabatically .",
    "this adiabatic approach is used to understand the influence of the substrate and qd phonons with qd electrons .",
    "we also compare our theoretical results with recent experimental observations .",
    "let us first evaluate the charge distribution of the qds with respect to its substrate using the gauss and green s theorems . from the gauss theorem  @xcite ,",
    "we can write    @xmath31    where , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the volume , unit vector normal to the surface and any given vector , respectively with @xmath35 = 1 , 2 , ... @xmath28 counts the number of closed surfaces ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we can now use eq .",

    "subsequently , by substituting them into eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) we can obtain    @xmath41    thus far , we have not explicitly described the quantity , @xmath42 , which is a dielectric constant .",
    "however , @xmath42 is obviously discontinuous at the boundary between the substrate and qds . for a given array of qds on a particular substrate",
    ", there will be @xmath43 surfaces enclosed by the @xmath44 surface and similarly , there will be @xmath45 surfaces enclosed by the @xmath46 surface for the substrate ( sub ) . the purpose of writing eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) is to obtain separate charge distributions in qds and substrate . by isolating them",
    ", one can further evaluate the strength of charge accumulation in qds , as compared to their substrate .",
    "as such , one can rewrite eq .",

    ", we will consider three conditions , namely ,    @xmath50    these conditions will be used to identify whether the electrons in qds are both electronically and/or adiabatically isolated from their substrate . satisfying condition ( i )",
    "implies that one can use the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) to obtain ( after using poisson equation , @xmath51 )    @xmath52    where , @xmath53 is the charge density , which is given by  @xcite    @xmath54    where @xmath0 is the electronic charge , while @xmath55 , in which @xmath56 is the bohr radius and @xmath57 denotes the permittivity of free space .",
    "note here that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the charge and carrier densities , respectively at @xmath10 k and without any external disturbances . whereas , the induced charge density , @xmath60 capture the charge accumulation due to temperature , @xmath61 k and due to other external disturbances . the potential , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the external potential .",
    "if @xmath60 = 0 , then we will arrive at the green s reciprocation theorem  @xcite .",
    "for example , after letting @xmath64 = @xmath35 and @xmath65 = @xmath28 , so that , @xmath66 ( for mathematical convenience )    @xmath67    or equivalently    @xmath68 \\approx 0 , \\label{eq:21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 denotes the surface charge density and subsequently , we can arrive at    @xmath70    because , @xmath71 or @xmath72 , which is to say , both qds and the substrate are approximately uncharged in the absence of temperature and external disturbances .",
    "now , we can repeat this procedure exactly by only switching the indices , qd and sub to obtain condition ( ii ) , @xmath73 .",
    "hence , both conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) imply that the qds are electronically isolated from the substrate . however , condition ( iii ) , @xmath74 gives rise to @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction between qds and its substrate .",
    "for example , from condition ( i ) , we have @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath76 @xmath78 , thus , the characteristic electronic ( subscript @xmath0 ) excitation probability for qds is much higher compared to its substrate , and vice versa for condition ( ii ) ( for example , see eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) ) .",
    "note here that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    where condition ( iii ) holds",
    ", the electronic properties of the substrate will also affect qds and vice versa .",
    "this means that the electronic excitation probability for both qds and the substrate are identical and therefore they ( qds and the substrate ) are electronically coupled .",
    "in other words , condition ( iii ) also implies that the confinement energy is close to zero .",
    "however , this electronic coupling does not occur in real qds that have finite confinement energies .",
    "this may explain why the qds are always electronically isolated if the confinement energy @xmath81 0 .",
    "shapes of qd structures also significantly affect their electronic properties  @xcite . this shape dependence will give rise to anisotropic ionization energy , and becomes important , if and only if we are comparing qds of different shapes . in reality , for a given nanoscale synthesis process , shapes of qds are quite similar , whereas size non - uniformities are quite substantial  @xcite . in cases where qds have different shapes , @xmath11 can be spatially averaged by incorporating the qd size , @xmath27 correctly ( will be a complicated algebraic function ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "the next issue here is to understand the phonon contribution to the electronic properties of qds .",
    "we will investigate the possibility of isolating the substrate phonons from qds , or coupling them to qds .",
    "the motivation to study these electronic ( given earlier ) and adiabatic isolations are important so as to evaluate the dephasing mechanisms namely , elastic ( pure ) and inelastic dephasing .",

    "the next step is to identify the relationship between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where we can define four inequalities , + a1   @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104-@xmath105 @xmath103 @xmath106 , + b2   @xmath107 @xmath103 @xmath104-@xmath108 @xmath103 @xmath109 , + c3   @xmath110 @xmath103 @xmath104-@xmath105 @xmath103 @xmath111 , + d4   @xmath112 @xmath103 @xmath104-@xmath108 @xmath103 @xmath113 , + where @xmath114 is the electronic relaxation lifetime or dephasing rate in the qds . both a1 and b2 will give rise to pure dephasing because the phonons timescales from the substrate ( @xmath115 ) and qds ( @xmath116 ) are low energy phonons compared to the qd energy - level difference ( @xmath100 ) . invoking condition ( i )",
    "implies a1 and b2 are unlikely and thus pure dephasing is negligible . on the other hand , the inequalities in c3 and d4",
    "satisfy condition ( i ) and will lead us to inelastic dephasing because of the adiabatic coupling between the electrons in the qds and phonons from both qds and substrate .",
    "hence , there is always a finite probability for the absorption and emission of qd ( @xmath104-@xmath108 ) and/or substrate ( @xmath104-@xmath105 ) phonons @xmath117    now , we know that condition ( i ) gives rise to inelastic dephasing as the dominant mechanism .",
    "therefore , the relaxation lifetime , @xmath114 can only be made longer by further enforcing the inequalities @xmath113 and/or @xmath111 .",
    "in other words , we need to satisfy and enforce the inequalities , @xmath112 and/or @xmath110 .",
    "for example , enforcing the inequality , @xmath112 means @xmath118 .",
    "this is exactly what have been done by zibik et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for example , the inequality , c3 ( and/or d4 ) have been achieved recently by deliberately changing the elemental composition of ingaas / gaas qds via annealing  @xcite .",
    "note here that @xmath119 .",
    "they have ( a ) obtained the inelastic dephasing due to c3 and/or d4 satisfying the theoretical results discussed above , and ( b ) achieved longer relaxation lifetime in qds ( @xmath114 ) by enforcing @xmath120 . in other words , they systematically reduce the photoluminescence ( pl ) energy peaks by annealing their samples .",
    "reducing pl energy peaks means decreasing @xmath100 and therefore increasing the magnitude of @xmath121 . as a result",
    ", they have enforced the inequalities , @xmath113 and/or @xmath111 as predicted by the iet and condition ( i ) .",
    "* claim 2 * : the electrons in qds can also be made adiabatically independent from the substrate phonons by employing condition ( ii ) , which is @xmath122 . in this case , we have @xmath123 @xmath76 @xmath124 and therefore , the @xmath104-@xmath105 interaction between qd electrons and the substrate phonons can be assumed to be switched - off ( no inelastic dephasing ) . to see this conclusion clearly , we need to recall proof 1 given earlier .",
    "* proof 2 * : after invoking condition ( ii ) , c3 and d4 are unlikely and therefore the inelastic dephasing is negligible .",
    "consequently , we are left with the inequalities given in a1 and b2 , which satisfy condition ( ii ) and pure dephasing as the dominant mechanism @xmath117    here , the relaxation lifetime , @xmath114 can only be made longer by further enforcing the inequalities @xmath106 and/or @xmath109 as given in a1 and b2 . based on condition ( ii ) , we need to enforce the inequalities , @xmath107 and/or @xmath102 with appropriate changes to the elemental composition of the qds or substrate or both .      finally , if the qds were to satisfy condition ( iii ) , then these qds are just dots with no electronic confinement effect and however , their @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction can not be understood without additional complications . in this case , the ionic mass will start to play a crucial role as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) .",
    "in other words , condition ( iii ) does not guarantee the relation , @xmath126 , and the reduced mass of the qds and substrate will determine the correct relationship .",
    "for example , the reduced mass ( @xmath127 ) is defined as @xmath128 and even if condition ( iii ) is fulfilled , we may still have @xmath129 , which will lead to @xmath130 . to understand this effect clearly ,",
    "let us first assume that the qds and the substrate are of same materials and elemental composition , and we do not intend to change the elemental composition .",
    "this assumption implies , @xmath131 and the inequality , @xmath132 is due to @xmath133 , which is entirely due to size .",
    "in addition , in this hypothetical case , condition ( iii ) can be achieved by making the size of the of qds larger . by doing so ,",
    "these qds lose both their electronic and phononic confinements .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the qds and the substrate materials are different ( @xmath129 ) , then condition ( iii ) can be achieved by changing the elemental composition of the qds . as a consequence , we have both @xmath129 and @xmath134 , which imply that the qds are not electronically isolated , but are still isolated with respect to phonons . in this second scenario , it is essential to note that one can not vary @xmath100 independent of @xmath135 .",
    "apart from that , small changes in the reduced mass does not play a significant role in the presence of condition ( i ) and ( ii ) because the strength of the electronic polarizability for each ion is more effective in determining the @xmath98 .",
    "this electronic polarizability is related to the interaction potential constants , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , which takes the deformable - ion effect into account .",
    "therefore , if we have a situation where @xmath138 @xmath76 @xmath139 and @xmath133 @xmath76 @xmath132 , then @xmath127 and @xmath11 compete with each other . in this case",
    ", @xmath11 is more sensitive than @xmath127 because the ionization energy that control the rigidity ( or deformability ) of the ions determines the @xmath98 .",
    "for example , slight changes in the reduced mass can change the phonon frequency , but not as effective as the ionization energy that control the ions deformability .",
    "however , any huge changes to @xmath127 will significantly reduce the effect of the ionization energy on @xmath98 .",
    "in this section we will scrutinize qds made of two different materials in which , one of them has been studied by sanguinetti et al .",
    "@xcite while the other one was investigated by zibik et al .",
    "note that the qds and their respective substrates discussed here have zincblende crystal structure  @xcite and therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:25 ] ) and  ( [ eq:26 ] ) can be applied directly  @xcite .",
    "the former group  @xcite studied gaas qds on al@xmath5ga@xmath6as substrate grown using modified - droplet epitaxy with qd density of the order of 10@xmath140 @xmath141 .",
    "they observed that the exciton dephasing of the qds is independent of confinement energy with no quantum - size effect .",
    "this conclusion was based on their temperature - dependent pl spectra measurements of which , the confinement - energy ( @xmath142 160 mev ) of one of their smaller qd sample , is much larger than the calculated activation energy ( @xmath142 30 mev , related to gaas longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon ) .",
    "therefore , the lo phonons do not contribute to inelastic dephasing  @xcite .",
    "as such , pure dephasing is the likely process with gaas lo phonons .",
    "these low - energy lo phonons do not cause electron relaxation from an excited state to the ground state .",
    "let us now apply our theory described earlier using conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) to gaas qds on al@xmath5ga@xmath6as substrate .",
    "the average ionization energies for both ga and as are given by , @xmath143 = ( 578.8 + 1979.3 + 2963)/3 = 1840 kjmol@xmath144 and @xmath145 = ( 947 + 1798 + 2735)/3 = 1827 kjmol@xmath144 , respectively .",
    "prior to averaging , all the ionization energies mentioned in this work were obtained from ref .",
    "this gives the total value of @xmath146 = 1827 + 1840 = 3667 kjmol@xmath144 .",
    "similarly , the total average for the substrate can be calculated as , @xmath143 = [ 0.7@xmath147(578.8 + 1979.3 + 2963)]/3 = 1288 kjmol@xmath144 , @xmath148 = [ 0.3@xmath147(577.5 + 1816.7 + 2744.8)]/3 = 514 kjmol@xmath144 , therefore , the total value for the substrate is @xmath149 = 1288 + 1827 + 514 = 3629 kjmol@xmath144 .",
    "thus , the difference is , @xmath146 @xmath150 @xmath149 = 3667 @xmath150 3629 = 38 kjmol@xmath144 = 400 mev atom@xmath144 and we have @xmath149 @xmath151 @xmath146 @xmath76 @xmath152 @xmath151 @xmath153 @xmath76 @xmath97 @xmath154 @xmath96 .",
    "obviously , this satisfies condition ( ii ) and gives rise to adiabatically independent qds and elastic dephasing is expected from our theory , in accordance with the experimental results and interpretations given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from that , the inequality , @xmath149 @xmath151 @xmath146 implies that the electrons in the substrate has a higher probability to be excited at any given temperature , compared to the electrons in qds . as a consequence ,",
    "the substrate ions deformability is larger due to large electronic excitation probability , which in turn , explains why the lattice vibrational frequency for the qds is larger than the substrate  @xcite .",
    "this means that , the ions in the qds are more rigid compared to their substrate .",
    "now , using the reduced mass ( in atomic mass unit ) as the main argument , we can obtain @xmath155 ( 28.98 ) @xmath151 @xmath135 ( 36.11 ) @xmath76 @xmath152 @xmath154 @xmath153 , which is in contradiction with the analysis stated above .",
    "however , as explained earlier , we have assumed that the effect of the small reduced mass is not as substantial as the ionization energy effect in accordance with ref .",
    "physically , what this means is that when the change in the reduced mass competes with the change in the ionization energy , then for as long as the change in the reduced mass is relatively small , the ionization energy effect will stay significant .",
    "the second evidence comes from the work of zibik et al .",
    "their qds are made from inas grown layer - by - layer with gaas as the matrix and barrier .",
    "they used the four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) spectroscopy to study the dephasing mechanism in qds .",
    "the samples were grown using the molecular beam epitaxy in the stranski - krashtanow mode and the qds were separated by 50 nm wide gaas barriers to prevent structural and electronic coupling between the qd layers  @xcite .",
    "both their calculations and experimental results point toward intersublevel ( inelastic ) dephasing in electron - doped qds , which revealed oscillatory behavior for the polarization decay ( for times @xmath151 5 ps ) . by repeating our @xmath11 averaging as shown above , and",
    "after identifying the gaas matrix / barrier as the substrate , we can arrive at @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath146 = 3667 @xmath150 3521 = 146 kjmol@xmath144 = 1500 mev atom@xmath144 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath149 @xmath154 @xmath146 @xmath76 @xmath152 @xmath154 @xmath153 @xmath76 @xmath97 @xmath151 @xmath96 .",
    "hence , inas qds satisfy condition ( i ) in which , the phonons from gaas coupled to qds non - adiabatically and favor the inelastic dephasing mechanism .",
    "the inequality , @xmath149 @xmath154 @xmath146 also implies that the electrons in the substrate have a lower probability to be excited at any given temperature , compared to the electrons in qds . as a consequence ,",
    "the substrate ions deformability is smaller due to smaller electronic excitation probability , which in turn , explains why the lattice vibrational frequency for the qds is smaller than the substrate  @xcite .",
    "this means that , the ions in the qds are less rigid compared to their substrate . as anticipated , our results again agree qualitatively with the results calculated and measured experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unlike the gaas qds discussed earlier , the reduced mass effect for inas qds also further supports the conclusion that @xmath152 @xmath154 @xmath153 . in other words , for inas / gaas system , we find that @xmath155 ( 36.11 ) @xmath151 @xmath135 ( 45.34 ) @xmath76 @xmath152 @xmath154 @xmath153 , which eventually satisfies the inequality , @xmath97 @xmath151 @xmath96 .",
    "one can surmise here that there is no competition between the ionization energy effect and the reduced mass contribution to the phonons .      at this juncture ,",
    "one may wonder two possibilities , namely , ( 1 ) if the size of the qds are much smaller than the substrate , then the inequality , @xmath149",
    "@xmath154 @xmath146 as stated for inas qds may not be true for all qd sizes , and as a result of this , ( 2 ) there is a possibility to grow dots that are not electronically isolated , in other words , during growth , the dots at a certain small size may satisfy @xmath149 @xmath156 @xmath146 , or even @xmath149 @xmath151 @xmath146 for very small inas qds .",
    "hence , one can indeed in principle grow dots with zero confinement energy by choosing the appropriate qd size and elemental composition for a given substrate .",
    "however , the changes in ionization energy due to size is much less compared to the change due to elemental composition ( between inas qds and gaas matrix ) . in other words , the inequality , @xmath149 @xmath154 @xmath146 will not be physically reversible for inas qds surrounded by gaas matrix by only changing the qd size because of large contribution due to elemental composition ( 1.5 ev atom@xmath144 ) .",
    "to see this effect clearly , let us write down the respective ionization energy approximation equations for the inas / gaas system , which can be obtained from ( using eq .",
    "( 8) given in ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath157    where    @xmath158",
    "consequently , we can identify @xmath159 as the atomic screened coulomb potential by assuming that qds are artificial atoms , which is given by  @xcite ( we apply eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) to two - electron hydrogen - like atomic systems )    @xmath160    and its solution is given by  @xcite    @xmath161 ^ 5}. \\label{eq:11a } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath162 is the atomic number ,    @xmath163    here , @xmath164 is the screening parameter s constant of proportionality and    @xmath165 . \\label{eq:12a } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) and  ( [ eq:11a ] ) , we can surmise that indeed smaller @xmath166 gives rise to smaller confinement .",
    "now , the change in @xmath166 due to elemental composition is @xmath167 . whereas , the change in the @xmath11 due to size is @xmath168 .",
    "since the change in the ionization energy due to size is smaller compared to elemental composition , we can assume that @xmath169 @xmath154 @xmath170 , which was done earlier .",
    "even if @xmath169 @xmath154 @xmath170 is not true , then it is possible to grow very small qds that are electronically coupled to the substrate .",
    "recall here that this electronic coupling means that the electronic excitation probabilities for both qds and the substrate are identical .    in summary , using the iet , it is possible for us to select suitable substrate and qd materials ( elemental composition ) in order to switch - off the contribution of substrate phonons .",
    "this will help the experimenters to grow qds with specific application in mind , be it for quantum computing ( with negligible phonon contribution from substrate ) or photovoltaic cells ( with large confinement energy and small @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering ) .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] indicates what to expect if we were to change the doping in ga@xmath171as@xmath172 and in@xmath171as@xmath172 qds systematically .",
    "regardless of doping @xmath173 , we will find that the total ionization energy of the ga@xmath171as@xmath172 qds will always be larger than their substrate s value .",
    "the reason is that the total ionization energies for both @xmath174 and @xmath175 are still larger than their substrate s averaged value , 3629 kjmol@xmath144 . on the other hand ,",
    "the total ionization energies for in@xmath171as@xmath172 qds for both @xmath174 and @xmath175 are smaller than their substrate s value , which is 3667 kjmol@xmath144 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "consequently , these qds will always be electronically isolated regardless of the doping @xmath173 .",
    "in other words , ga@xmath171as@xmath172 qds will remain adiabatically independent from their substrate for all doping @xmath173 ( pure dephasing ) .",
    "whereas , for in@xmath171as@xmath172 qds , the substrate phonons will keep influencing the electrons in the qds for all doping @xmath173 ( inelastic dephasing ) .",
    "it is important to note here that even if we were to increase the size of these qds to form thin films , these thin films will still be electronically isolated from their substrate due to their different elemental composition .",
    "that is why thin films of different elemental composition from their substrate will have different electronic properties compared to their substrate .",
    "this will remain true for as long as the elemental composition between the substrate and the thin films are different .",
    "here , we discuss the various types of dephasing rates ( relaxation lifetimes , @xmath176 ) due to defects ( def ) , impurities ( imp : magnetic and non - magnetic ) , spin , @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath1 interactions , and how they are related to the iet .",
    "these effects are first analyzed in the absence of any external perturbations such as laser ( to create excitons ) and applied magnetic fields .",
    "subsequently , further evaluations are carried out based on the changes in the spin transition probability by identifying the fact that the inelastic dephasing is favorable with increasing transition probability between the spin - down and spin - up states . whereas , pure dephasing is preferred if the transition probability approaches zero .",
    "hence , our strategy here is to relate the changes in the spin transition probability with the iet , and subsequently to the inelastic or pure dephasing mechanism .",
    "apparently , we can not use this strategy to calculate the dephasing rates .",
    "however , the changes in the transition probability can be related to the dephasing rates .",
    "this means that , if the transition probability approaches one , then the dominant dephasing rate is determined by the inelastic dephasing .",
    "in contrast , in the event where the transition probability approaches zero , then the pure dephasing will act as the dominant mechanism and determines the dephasing rate .",
    "importantly , the ionization energy approximation requires that all the electrons are correlated and they are not free - electrons , be it in the conduction or valence band .",
    "thus , this approach is not suitable for free - electron metallic substrates . recall that our strategy here is to develop a theory to understand why the experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite is different from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , the total dephasing rate ( relaxation lifetime ) for qds can be written as  @xcite    @xmath177    where , @xmath178 is the total dephasing rate in a qd , while the other respective dephasing rates are due to @xmath0(qd)-@xmath0(qd ) , @xmath0(qd)-@xmath1(sub ) and @xmath0(qd)-@xmath1(qd ) interactions , impurities , defects and spin . for non - magnetic and/or magnetic system above the kondo temperature and in the absence of applied magnetic field , we can ignore @xmath179 , while @xmath180 and @xmath181 can be re - labeled as @xmath182 that includes all types of defects ( vacancy , interstitial , substitution at different sites ) , including different types of elements .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : a1 ] ) can now be rewritten as    @xmath183    the next step is to invoke eqs .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) and  ( [ eq:26 ] ) , which imply that the electrons in the qd ( e(qd ) ) are influenced by the phonons from the qd ( ph(qd ) ) and substrate ( ph(sub ) ) .",

    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) in the form of eq .",
