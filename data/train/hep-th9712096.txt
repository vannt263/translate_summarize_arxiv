    "back in 1962 schwinger considered the possibility that a vector gauge field can imply a nonzero mass gauge particle .",
    "he showed this is indeed the case for an exactly solvable model , namely two - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath1 ) with a massless fermion field @xcite .",
    "this simple , although non - trivial , field theory has become since an arena to probe different aspects of quantum field theory @xcite . for instance , the axial anomaly , the charge screening and the bosonization presented by the model , together with alternative methods of solution , have been studied by different authors @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the results from qed@xmath1 that might shed light on the non - perturbative features not only of qed@xmath2 but also of qcd@xmath2 and quantum gravity in its gauge - theory - like formulation @xcite .    being qed@xmath2 the gauge theory _ par excellence _",
    "it was considered worth adopting loop variables techniques in its description @xcite because in this way gauge invariance could be explicitly implemented .",
    "lattice qed@xmath2 has been successfully developed along these lines and computational calculations have been improved with respect to simulations @xcite .",
    "also , a four - dimensional ( continuum ) gravitational analogue constructed out of gravity plus fermions has been studied in this framework @xcite . in every case",
    "the presence of fermions is automatically accounted for by including open curves , besides loops , to parametrize operators and state vectors .",
    "the fermions necessarily stand at the end points of the open curves .",
    "moreover , the dynamics gets geometrically coded into the breaking , rejoining and rerouting of such open curves and loops through their intersection points .",
    "this is deeply significant for non - perturbative quantum gravity where the role of diffeomorphism invariance is central and such a description naturally fits in @xcite . for the qed@xmath2 case this geometrical picture of dynamics led to useful criteria to approximate the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "wilson loops are computed in terms of the holonomy elements associated to the parallel transport along closed curves . in the maxwell case",
    "the holonomies are elements of the u(1 ) group .",
    "they are not only invariant under small gauge transformations generated by the gauss law constraint , but also under large gauge transformations . that is the reason why they naturally describe compact electrodynamics , which is also characterized by the property that the range of @xmath3 , in the weyl gauge for the two - dimensional case , is the circle instead of the real line as it is in the standard noncompact case . this fact is well known and has far reaching consequences in higher dimensions .",
    "polyakov @xcite has argued that it is necessary to decide , based on physical grounds , what version of qed is realized in nature . in particular , the fact that in the non abelian case the non compact version can not be formulated on a discrete lattice leads him to consider that , if qed arises as a subgroup of some nonabelian gauge theory , we are necessarily dealing with the compact version . earlier discussions of compact qed in the lattice can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "the schwinger model has been recently studied in the hamiltonian @xcite and lagrangean@xcite lattice loop representation . in these papers",
    ", it is shown that the chiral symmetry is broken and the @xmath0-dependence of the vacuum is not present .    in what concerns the case of higher dimensions",
    ", it has been shown that monopoles arising in the compact abelian sector of 2 + 1 qcd play a fundamental role in the confinement process . in polyakov",
    "s analysis loops are crucial to understand this process . in particular , he has recently shown that the loop world sheets acquires string like degrees of freedom due to the presence of a diluted gas of monopoles @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "loop variables are introduced for the compact schwinger s model along the lines of @xcite . starting with the canonical analysis of qed@xmath1 , which yields the gauss law first - class constraint ,",
    "loop variables are defined such that they have zero poisson brackets with it .",
    "they form a closed algebra and turn out to be enough to describe the dynamics .",
    "the hamiltonian is reexpressed as a limit of some of these loop variables when the curves shrink down to a point .",
    "the quantum theory is defined such that the poisson algebra becomes a commutator algebra and the loop representation is built by choosing one of these loop operators to create a state with an extra loop ( open curve ) out of an arbitrary state and then using the operator algebra .",
    "thus , it is possible to work entirely in the loop representation . in order to recover the standard ( local ) physical information , like the energy spectrum for example",
    ", one has to take the corresponding limit of the loops ( open curves ) shrinking to a point . before determining the properties of the energy spectrum of the full theory",
    ", we found it convenient to study the semiclassical situation where there is a quantum fermion field interacting with a classical electromagnetic field .",
    "some technicalities become more transparent if use is made of a bi - local fourier transform of the operators parametrized by open curves .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "this procedure yields a built - in _ gauge - invariant _ point - split regularization for the fermion vacuum energy . in this semiclassical context , the vacuum to vacuum expectation value for the divergence of the axial current produces the known value for the axial anomaly in a straightforward manner .",
    "also , the vacuum expectation value of the so called anomalous commutators are directly derived from the loop variables algebra .",
    "remarkably enough , the corresponding poisson brackets algebra already contains the relevant information . using the separability of the full schroedinger equation for the system ,",
    "the zero mode sector of the spectrum is considered next .",
    "the non - equally spaced results for the zero mode energy found in this case seem to indicate that , in the general compact case , the spectrum does not correspond to a free massive boson . by considering the limit in which the length of the @xmath4 spatial slice goes to zero",
    "one recovers the typical harmonic oscillator spectrum for the zero mass mode together with its free bosonic behavior , which is characteristic of the non - compact schwinger model .",
    "as we have previously emphasized , loop variables naturally describe a compact version of the electromagnetic interaction . in order to recover the noncompact theory it is necessary to introduce additional angular variables , which are conjugated to the integer numbers characterizing the large gauge transformations .",

    "no independent loop variable is obtained by considering a gauge invariant non local variable containing @xmath37 as an insertion .",
    "it is important to recall , once again , that in this approach all the information about the theory is encoded in terms of loop variables , which are gauge invariant under small and large gauge transformations .",

    "an alternative route in understanding the compact schwinger model is been pursued in ref.@xcite , following the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "some preliminary results are the following . since the gauss law still implies that the wave function is independent of the excited modes of the vector potential in the weyl gauge , there are no boundary condition modifications related to these variables arising from the compactification .",
