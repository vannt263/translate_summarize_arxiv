    "the particles interact through a two - body potential @xmath0 which admits a negative energy bound state . at zero temperature and low particle densities",
    ", this leads to the formation of diatomic molecules forming a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it was realized in the 80s @xcite that bcs theory can be adequately applied to such types of tightly bound fermions .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that in the low density limit the macroscopic variations in the pair density should be well captured by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation . from a mathematical point of view ,",
    "the emergence of the gp functional in the low density limit was recently proven in @xcite for the static case , and the dynamical case was subsequently treated in @xcite .",
    "the assumption , that the two - body interaction potential allows for a bound state plays a crucial role . in the case of weak coupling where the potential is not strong enough to form a bound state",
    ", the pairing mechanism may still play an important role for the macroscopic behavior of the system , but the separation of paired particles can be much larger , in this case , than the average particle spacing .",
    "in fact this is the case in the usual bcs description of superconducting materials .",
    "close to the critical temperature the macroscopic variation of the pairs is captured by the ginzburg - landau equation in this case , as pointed out by gorkov @xcite soon after the introduction of bcs theory .",
    "the first mathematical proof of the emergence of ginzburg - landau theory from bcs theory was recently given in @xcite , which itself relied on earlier work on the bcs functional @xcite .",
    "in the current paper our starting point is the full bcs hartree - fock functional .",
    "that is , we include the direct and exchange terms in the interaction energy .",
    "one also finds this functional under the name bogolubov - hartree - fock ( bhf ) functional in the literature .",
    "the inclusion of the density - density interaction adds additional difficulties concerning stability of the system .",
    "it forces us to restrict to systems with a two - body potential @xmath0 that , on the one hand , has an attractive tail deep enough to allows for a bound state and , on the other hand , is sufficiently repulsive at short distances to guarantee stability .",
    "this is consistent with typically considered interaction potentials @xcite .    .",
    "]    we shall investigate the ground state energy of the bhf functional in the low density limit .",
    "we introduce a small parameter @xmath1 playing the role of the inverse particle number , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "we consider external potentials that confine the particles on a length scale of order @xmath3 , while the range of the interaction among the particles is of order one .",
    "this implies that the density of particles is of the order @xmath4 .",
    "hence the small parameter @xmath1 represents the square root of the density as well the ratio between the microscopic and macroscopic length scale .",
    "we are going to show that in the low density limit the fermions group together in pairs , such that the leading order in the energy is given by the number of pairs , @xmath5 , times the binding energy of a pair , @xmath6 .",
    "the next to leading order is given by the energy of a repulsive bose gas , consisting of fermion pairs , in a trap , and can be described in terms of the gross - pitaevskii energy functional .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath7 denotes the bhf energy of @xmath8 fermions we shall obtain @xmath9 for small @xmath1 , where @xmath10 denotes the gross - pitaevskii energy with appropriate interaction parameter @xmath11 , which can be computed in terms of the microscopic quantities .",
    "the prefactor @xmath12 should be interpreted as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of fermion pairs and @xmath15 is the macroscopic length scale .",
    "we will also give a detailed description of the corresponding ground state of the bhf functional .",
    "its minimizer turns out to be given , to leading order in @xmath1 , in the form of the two particle wavefunction @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ground state of a bound fermion pair with energy @xmath6 , and @xmath18 solves the gp equation and describes the density fluctuations of the pairs .",
    "our work is an extension of @xcite in two directions .",
    "first , we include exchange and direct terms in the energy functional .",
    "second , we avoid working with infinite , periodic systems , which allows us to significantly simplify the proof and also to improve the error bounds , utilizing ideas in @xcite . in particular",
    ", we do not need to use here the rather involved semiclassical estimates of @xcite .",
    "our work presents the first proof of the occurrence of pairing in the ground state of a non - translation invariant bogolubov - hartree - fock system .",
    "( for a translation invariant system this was previously shown in @xcite . )",
    "the ground state properties of the bhf functional , in the context of newtonian interaction , were studied in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "still it could not be shown that the fermions in the ground state exhibit pairing .",
    "its occurrence was only shown numerically in @xcite . in the low density limit , which we are studying here ,",
    "the ground state actually predominately consists of pairs , in a sense to be made precise below .",
    "in particular , it is essential for our results that the pairing term is included in the energy functional ; the hartree - fock functional for particle - number conserving states would lead to markedly different results , and is inappropriate for the description of low density gases .",
    "as in bcs theory , the state of a fermionic system is described by a self - adjoint operator @xmath19 , satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "it is determined by two operators @xmath21 and has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is trace class and @xmath24 is hilbert - schmidt and symmetric , i.e. @xmath25 , which implies that @xmath26 .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 , @xmath28 the operators with kernels @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we note that we do not include spin variables here , but rather assume @xmath31-invariance of the states @xcite .",
    "the full , spin - dependent cooper - pair wave function is the product of @xmath24 with an anti - symmetric spin singlet . since @xmath24 is symmetric ,",
    "the latter is thus anti - symmetric , as appropriate for fermions .",
    "given an external potential @xmath32 and a two - particle interaction potential @xmath0 , the corresponding bogolubov - hartree - fock functional ( bhf ) is given by @xmath33 we note that the terms in the first line represent the bcs functional , while the last line contains the additional exchange and direct terms in the interaction energy .",
    "a formal derivation of this functional from quantum mechanics can be obtained via restriction to quasi - free states , see @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) or @xcite .",
    "let us mention that our methods also allow to include a magnetic external vector potential , but for simplicity we shall not do so here .",
    "we study a system of @xmath3 fermions interacting by means of a two - body interaction @xmath34 , confined in an external potential of the form @xmath35 .",
    "i.e. , the external potential varies on a scale of order @xmath8 whereas @xmath0 varies on a scale of order one . since the trap @xmath32 confines the particles within a volume of order @xmath36 ,",
    "the particle density is of the order @xmath4 .",
    "hence the limit of small @xmath1 corresponds to a dilute or low density limit .",
    "since we expect the interaction energy per particle pair to be of the order of the density , we shall also consider suitably weak external potentials , i.e. , we replace @xmath32 by @xmath37 .",
    "it is convenient to use macroscopic variables instead of microscopic ones , i.e. , we define @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting bhf functional is then given by ( now dropping the subscripts @xmath1 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding ground state energy is denoted as @xmath44    , while the external potential varies on a scale of order @xmath45 . ]    for @xmath46 the gp functional is defined as @xmath47 the factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , in the first two terms result from the fact that describes fermion _ pairs_. the interaction parameter @xmath50 will be determined by the bhf functional and represents the interaction strength among different pairs .",
    "we denote the ground state energy of the gp functional as @xmath51    we shall consider the minimization problem and show that its value in the limit @xmath52 is to leading order given by the binding energy of the fermion pairs , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "this assumes , of course , that the two - body interaction potential @xmath0 allows for a negative energy bound state , which is part of the following assumption .",
    "[ asm : v ] let @xmath54 be real - valued , with @xmath55 , such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 has a normalized ground state @xmath17 with corresponding ground state energy @xmath58 .    including direct and exchange term into the bcs functional gives rise to a new problem . a priori it is not clear whether the functional guarantees stability of the second kind . to ensure it we impose the following further assumption on @xmath0 .",

    "the following construction shows that it is easy to find potentials @xmath0 with the desired properties of assumptions  [ asm : v ] and  [ asm : v : dir_ex ] : choose a potential @xmath63 which is strictly negative on an open set @xmath64 , such that @xmath60 .",

    "[ thm : gp ] partly relies on ideas in @xcite , where the corresponding time - dependent problem was studied for the bcs functional , i.e. , in the absence of direct and exchange term .",

    "before giving a sketch of the proof of theorem  [ thm : gp ] we show how assumption  [ asm : v : dir_ex ] gives rise to stability of the second kind .",
    "in fact we simply show that the assumption guarantees that the sum of the direct and exchange terms is non - negative . to this aim",
