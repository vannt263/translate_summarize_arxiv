    "<S> let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the number of isis equal to @xmath70 and to @xmath71 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then it is readily checked that the constructed sequence is a solution of ( [ eq : t_map ] ) at the feedback delay time @xmath72 red dotted lines in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> note that these solutions lie exactly on the numerical branches which validates the above reasoning . </S>",
    "<S> however , some parts of the branches are unstable and not observable . </S>",
    "<S> since each bipartite solution corresponds to a pair of points @xmath74 and @xmath75 , solutions with identical @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to the same points in the bifurcation diagrams in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> let us consider the limit @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the isis @xmath88 and @xmath89 tend to the same limit @xmath90 which is the period of the rs at the bifurcation point . </S>",
    "<S> then , ( [ eq : tau - n1-n2 ] ) converges to @xmath91 , while all bipartite solutions converge to the rs with period @xmath92 .    </S>",

    "<S> numerical simulations show that many of the bipartite solutions stabilize leading to high multistability . in particular , we observe that all bipartite solutions with same values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 exhibit identical stability . </S>",
    "<S> this emergence of numerous irregular spiking , or jittering , regimes motivates the choice of the name `` multi - jitter bifurcation '' .    </S>",
    "<S> high multistability is a well - known property of systems with time delays . </S>",
    "<S> a common reason is the so - called reappearance of periodic solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism may cause multistability of coexisting periodic solutions , whose number is linearly proportional to the delay . due to multi - jitter bifurcation , multistability can develop much faster , since the number of coexisting solutions grows exponentially with the delay [ cf . </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that the underlying mechanism is quite different .    </S>",
    "<S> irregular spiking regimes similar to the ones described here were reported previously for systems exhibiting a dynamical `` memory effect '' , where the effect of each incoming pulse lasts for several periods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in system ( [ eq:1 ] ) , however , the effect of a pulse decays completely within one period . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the origin of jittering must be different . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it relies on another kind of memory , which is provided by the delay line and stores the last @xmath25 isis . </S>",
    "<S> this memory preserves fundamental properties of time , which are responsible for the degeneracy of the multi - jitter bifurcation . to explain this </S>",
    "<S> let us consider ( [ eq : t_map ] ) as a @xmath25-dimensional mapping @xmath93 disregarding the calculation of the new isi @xmath4 as in ( [ eq : t_map ] ) , all the map does is to move the timeframe by shifting all isis one place ahead . </S>",
    "<S> the rigid nature of time allows no physically meaningful modification of this part of the map which could unfold the degenerate bifurcation . moreover , the new isi @xmath4 depends exclusively on the sum of the previous isis which has the effect that all past intervals have an equal influence on the new isi regardless of their order . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the combinatorial accumulation of coexisting solutions with differently ordered isis is generated .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the delayed feedback , another essential ingredient for the multi - jitter bifurcation is the existence of points where the prc fulfills @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> since the prc is a characteristic that can be measured for an arbitrary oscillator @xcite , this condition gives a practical criterion for the occurence of jittering regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in this context it is worth noticing that the condition @xmath94 is equivalent to the non - monotonicity of the system s response to an external pulse , i.e. there are such phases @xmath95 that a pulse can reverse their order as @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for a smooth one - dimensional system as ( [ eq:1 ] ) the reversal of phases is only possible if the feedback takes the form of @xmath97-pulses . with pulses of finite duration two continuous orbits connecting the different phase values before and after the pulse can not cross each other . </S>",
    "<S> this prevents a reversal of phases . </S>",

    "<S> where the rs regime is unstable , the system switches to irregular spiking , and we mainly observe @xmath63-periodic bipartite solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the insets in the lower part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bifdiags - hh - fhn](a ) show two such period-5 bipartite regimes of the fitzhugh - nagumo oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> note that both of them coexist at @xmath100 ms , which illustrates the multistability of the system . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , two period-4 bipartite regimes coexisting for @xmath101 ms for the hodgkin - huxley model are shown in [ fig : bifdiags - hh - fhn](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> bipartite solutions are a basic form of jittering both in phase - reduced models and realistic systems . however , beyond the multi - jitter bifurcation the bipartite solutions may undergo subsequent bifurcations . in system ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we observed higher - periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes for larger steepnesses of the prc ( @xmath102 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar regimes were also found for the hodgkin - huxley model . </S>",
    "<S> an example showing aperiodic jittering is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bifdiags - hh - fhn](b ) for @xmath103 ms . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> we show more examples of aperiodic jittering [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s7 ] ] .    to conclude , in a phase oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback ( [ eq:1 ] ) we discovered a surprising bifurcation leading to the emergence of a large number ( @xmath104 ) of jittering solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that this multi - jitter bifurcation does not only appear in phase - reduced models , but also in realistic neuron models and even in physically implemented electronic systems . </S>",
    "<S> these findings support our theoretical results and provide motivation for a deeper study of the multi - jitter phenomenon .    the possibility of jittering depends on the steepness of the prc which is an easily measurable quantity for most oscillatory systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our findings provide an easy criterion to check for the existence of jittering in a given system . </S>",
    "<S> this may prove useful in a variety of research areas , where pulsatile feedback or interactions of oscillating elements takes place . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , this might be one of the mechanisms behind the appearance of irregular spiking in neuronal models with delayed feedback @xcite and timing jitter in semiconductor laser systems with delayed feedback @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for applications which exploit complex transient behavior such as liquid state machines @xcite the high dimension of the unstable manifold at the bifurcation can be interesting . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in view of the possibility of a huge number of coexisting attracting orbits beyond the bifurcation the system can serve as a memory device by associating inputs with the attractors to which they make the system converge .    </S>",
