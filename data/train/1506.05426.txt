    "however , setting @xmath322 yields a counterexample because @xmath323 .    the author has found that investigating bounds of the function @xmath315 naturally leads to a question about the infinitude of twin primes , which hints at the potential difficulty of the problem .",
    "indeed , harrington and jones @xcite have arrived at the same conclusion while studying the function @xmath324 , and they conjecture that the values of @xmath325 can be arbitrarily large . to avoid the unpredictability of the values of the function @xmath326 , harrington and jones have restricted the domain of @xmath326 to the set @xmath327 of positive integers @xmath17 with the property that none of the numbers in the set @xmath328 has a prime factor that is congruent to @xmath4 modulo @xmath213 . with this restriction of the domain of @xmath326 ,",
    "these two authors have established results analogous to those that shapiro gave for the function @xmath312 mentioned earlier .",
    "in fact , we speculate that methods analogous to those that harrington and jones have used could easily generalize to allow for analogous results concerning functions @xmath329 if one is willing to use a sufficiently restricted domain of @xmath330 .",
    "we next remark that , in theorem [ thm2.4 ] , the requirement that @xmath248 is essential . for example , write @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , and @xmath335",

    "lastly , we have not spent much effort analyzing the  sizes \" of the functions @xmath6 or searching for @xmath6-perfect numbers .",
    "we might inquire about the average order or possible upper and lower bounds for @xmath6 for a general positive even integer @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , it is natural to ask if there even are any @xmath6-perfect numbers other than @xmath310 for even positive integers @xmath5 .",
