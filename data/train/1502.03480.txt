    "water is an important material in industry , technology and biological processes due to its unusual properties .",
    "water unusual properties comprise many anomalous behavior , with 70 known anomalies  @xcite , like the maximum value of its density in @xmath0c at room pressure , and the increase of the diffusion as the system is compressed  @xcite .",
    "these anomalies have been explained in terms of the formation of hydrogen bond network .",
    "the water molecules form open and compact ( bonded and nonbonded ) clusters of tetramers . from the competition between these structures",
    "the anomalies arise .    as a natural consequence of the polimorphism of water clusters",
    "the pressure - temperature phase diagram of water is very complex . at low temperatures",
    ", water shows a coexistence of two amorphous phases : a low density amorphous and a high density amorphous . for higher temperatures , these two amorphous phases might lead to the appearance of two liquid phases , separated by a first order phase transition line ended in a liquid - liquid critical point ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "whereas , homogeneous nucleation occurs in this region , that is called _ no man s land _ , and because of that , it is a incredible hard task to do experimental measures of liquid water in bulk systems in this region .",
    "theoretically , the existence of these two liquid phases was evidenced in the atomistic st4 model by poole and co - authors  @xcite and confirmed in recent simulations  @xcite . as well , new experiments shows a evidence of the coexistence of a high - density and low - density liquid phase of water  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath1 was also predicted for others atomistic models of water  @xcite , and in models for phosphorus  @xcite , silica  @xcite , silicon  @xcite , carbon  @xcite , hydrogen  @xcite and colloidal systems  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies suggests that the @xmath1 can be a open trend on supercooled water and other materials .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", there is still several open questions about the @xmath1 .    as an attempt to avoid the crystallization of water in the _ no man s land _",
    ", experiments with nanoconfined water have been performed recently  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a confining structure changes the number of hydrogen bonds , avoiding the nucleation .",
    "some experiments of water confined in nanopores , performed by x - ray and neutron scattering , show that liquid states persist down to temperatures much lower than in bulk  @xcite .",
    "the nanopores size has important influence in the crystallization of the system  @xcite , and hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopores can lead to distinct results as well  @xcite .",
    "classical atomistic models for water are important tools to understand its properties . on the other hand ,",
    "coarse - grained models arise as an interesting tool to see the universal mechanisms that lead to anomalous waterlike properties .",
    "coarse - grained models may reproduce diffusion and density anomalies and can be modeled by core - softened ( cs ) potentials with two length scales , that can be constructed using a shoulder or a ramp potential  @xcite .",
    "these coarse - grained models for anomalous fluids are able to capture the bulk waterlike anomalies and averaged properties in the confined materials .",
    "when confined by fixed hydrophilic plates , the fluid - wall interaction can induce solidification and shift the anomalous properties to higher temperatures , while hydrophobic nanopores lead the system to remain in liquid state and shift the waterlike anomalies to lower temperatures in relation to bulk  @xcite .",
    "whereas , when the nanopore has at least one degree of freedom , the anomalous behavior of the fluid disappear and distinct phase transitions are observed  @xcite .",
    "cs fluids confined in nanotubes also present interesting findings , similar to obtained in atomistic models for water , as the increase in diffusion coefficient and flux for narrow nanotubes associated to a layer to single - file transition and a discontinuity in the enhancement flow factor  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of these core - softened potentials is that due to the simplicity of the two length scales , they are not capable to reproduce the effects related to the third coordination shell of the anomalous fluid what might be relevant under confinement  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the relevance of the detail structure of the liquid , the structure of the confining system is also relevant since biological and physical materials do not exhibit the smoothness and regularity of the flat walls and tubes enployed in the simulations .",
    "this naturaly raises the question of what is the role played by the structure of the liquid and of the interface in the thermodynamic , dynamic and structural behavior of confined systems .",
    "recent simulations have shown that the hydrophobic or hydrophilic behavior of the confining surfaces are governed by the interfacial free energy , that strongly depends on the surface structure  @xcite . even thought these simulations do not observe important differences in the diffusion of the systems confined between smooth and rough walls  @xcite",
    ", they show that the adsorption behavior and the solvation pressure are significantly affected by the roughness of the confining surface  @xcite and that different liquid and solid phases that exist in the smooth confined are not present in the rough case  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the question of which are the effects of the roughness of the nanopore wall in the physical properties of a anomalous fluids .",
    "our analysis is done in the framework of an effective model that incorporates not only the two length scales traditionally present in the cs potentials but additional length scales representing the third coordination shell of the fluid .",
    "our goal is also to understand the effect of the structure of the liquid in the thermodynamic , dynamic and structural properties of a fluid confined in a nanopore .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and the methods and simulation details are described ; the results are given in sec .",
    "iii ; and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in this paper all physical quantities are computed in the standard lj units  @xcite , @xmath2 for distance , density of particles and time , respectively , and @xmath3 for the pressure , energy and temperature , respectively , where @xmath4 is the distance parameter , @xmath5 the energy parameter and @xmath6 the mass parameter . since all physical quantities are defined in reduced lj units , the @xmath7 is omitted , in order to simplify the discussion .",
    "the fluid is composed by @xmath8 spherical particles of diameter @xmath9 and mass @xmath6 confined between two parallel and fixed plates .",
    "we have studied two kinds of nanopores : with smooth and structured walls .",
    "smooth plates are modeled by force fields and do not have structure , interacting continuously with the fluid .",
    "structured plates are formed by spherical particles in a square lattice with punctual interactions . a schematic depiction for the systems with ( a ) smooth and ( b ) structured plates is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the particles of the fluid interact through the isotropic effective potential  @xcite given by @xmath10 +    \\sum_{j=0}^{4}h_j\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{r - c_j}{w_j}\\right)\\right ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with the parameters given in the table [ table1 ] . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the potential versus distance in dimensionless units . in this work ,",
    "we use @xmath11 .",
    "this effective potential was derived from the ornstein - zernike and integral equations applied to the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function of the atomistic model st4  @xcite . at short distances",
    "it shows two characteristc length scales : one at @xmath12 and another at @xmath13 , as in the usual coarse grained potentials proposed to model the anomalous liquids .",
    "in addition a third length scale at @xmath14 is also present .",
    "since the derivation of the potential was based in the oxygen radial distribution function these length scales represent the oxygen - oxygen distances related to the relevant coordination shells in the liquid .",
    "the bulk system exhibits waterlike anomalies , and the liquid - gas and liquid - liquid critical points predicted for water  @xcite .    in the confined system the particles of the fluid interact with the wall by the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the standard 12 - 6 lj potential  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff distance is @xmath17 . for smooth plates ,",
    "the interaction occurs just in @xmath18 direction and the potential is written as @xmath19 .",

    "[ fig12 ] summarizes the behavior of ( a ) @xmath1 and ( b ) @xmath20 for the different nanopores sizes and structured walls .",
    "the location of both critical points changes with the distances between the plates .",
    "as the nanopore width @xmath21 decreases , the @xmath1 goes to lower temperatures and higher pressures , while the @xmath20 is shifted to lower temperatures and lower pressures too .",
    "in this work we have studied the effects of the nanopore structure and of the water potential length scales in the waterlike properties of a anomalous fluid .",
    "first , we tested the effect of using a three length scales potential for analyzing the fluid behavior . in this case",
    "the system confined by very small distances exhibits a different behavior when compared with confinement by intermediate and large distances .",
    "this difference can be explained by the the arrangement of the fluid particles in the first , second or third length scale of the potential .",
    "then we check the differences in the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of the fluid when it was confined between smooth and structured walls . when observed , the density and diffusion anomalies are shifted to lower temperatures and higher pressures in relation to bulk for both kinds of confinement .",
    "however , the critical points and the limit between solid and fluid phases present a significant difference for each system . for high degrees of confinement the properties of the fluid",
    "is very well defined when confined by smooth nanopores , but the fluid crystallizes for structured walls and small @xmath21 . for intermediates separation of walls , smooth confinement present solidification and structured confinement do not .",
    "so , a non - monotonic behavior is observed in the properties of the fluid with @xmath21 when confined by smooth plates and a monotonic behavior with @xmath21 when confined between structured plates .",
    "the scales of the fluid - fluid and the fluid - plate interaction potential are responsible for the different behavior observed for each kind of confinement .",
