    "in experimental designs , the completely randomization is usually recommended to avoid the bias caused by the factors that are not controlled .",
    "however , in many industrial or agricultural experiments , there often exist factors whose levels are difficult to change .",
    "these factors are called the whole - plot factors .",
    "the other factors whose levels are easy to change are called the subplot factors . if whole - plot factors exist in an experiment and the completely randomization is conducted , then the experimental cost will increase due to frequently changing levels of the whole - plot factors .",
    "to reduce the cost , the two - stage randomization strategy is usually suggested .",
    "first the randomization is conducted only for the treatments of whole - plot factors , call the whole plots .",
    "then in each whole plot , the second randomization is conducted for the treatments of subplot factors , called the subplots .",
    "this kind of experiments was first introduced by fisher ( 1925 ) and the design used for the experiment is referred to as the split - plot design ( spd ) .",
    "the two - stage randomization results in the multistratum structure of the split - plot design and leads to two error terms , the whole - plot errors and the subplot errors .",
    "therefore , traditional analysis methods for completely randomized designs are no longer appropriate and the optimal completely randomized designs may not be optimal for the split - plot experiment . in literature , many approaches for constructing optimal split - plot designs have been proposed .",
    "a common construction method is based on the minimum aberration criterion , which can be found in huang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , binham and sitter ( 1999a , 1999b , 2001 , 2003 ) , mukerjee and fang ( 2002 ) , and tichon et al .",
    "the minimum aberration criterion aims to find the optimal design which minimizes the alias of the important effects .",
    "an idea of this method is that the powers to detect significant effects are not the same for whole - plot factors and subplot factors .",
    "it is usually assumed that the subplot variability is smaller than the whole - plot variability , which implies that the power to detect significant subplot effects is greater than the power to detect significant whole - plot effects .",
    "hence , subplot factors are considered more important and should be given shorter world length than whole - plot factors .",
    "the design that sequentially minimizes the wordlength patterns is selected as the minimum aberration split - plot design . since the minimum aberration criterion minimizes the alias , the optimal split - plot design constructed by this criterion should have less bias of the estimation for the important effects .",
    "another widely used criterion for constructing optimal split - plot designs is the @xmath0-optimal criterion , which can be found in lesinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , goos and vandebroek ( 2001 , 2003 , 2004 ) and jones and goos ( 2007 ) .",
    "the basic idea of this construction method is that a good split - plot design should have higher estimation ability for the fitted model .",
    "this estimation ability can be evaluated by measuring the determinant of the information matrix of a design , called the @xmath0-efficiency .",
    "the @xmath0-optimal split - plot design is the one which has the highest @xmath0-efficiency among all of designs .",
    "since maximizing the @xmath0-efficiency of a design is equivalent to minimizing the determinant of the variance - covariant matrix of the estimation , the @xmath0-optimal split - plot design should have smaller variances and covariances for the estimation of the effects .",
    "a good review of split - plot designs can be found in jones and nachtsheim ( 2009 ) .",
    "although the minimum aberration criterion and the @xmath0-optimal criterion are commonly used for constructing optimal split - plot designs , the optimal designs selected by the two criteria may have higher mean square error ( mse ) , which consists of the square of the bias matrix and the variance - covariance matrix of the estimation .",
    "the minimum aberration criterion focuses on minimizing the bias of the estimation but less considers minimizing the variances and covariances .",
    "therefore , the optimal split - plot design constructed by this criterion may have higher mean square error due to higher variances or covariances of the estimation . on the contrary , the @xmath0-optimal criterion aims to minimize the variances and covariances but ignores the bias of the estimation . when the fitted model is misspecified , there exists a bias for the estimation .",
    "therefore , the optimal split - plot design constructed by the @xmath0-optimal criterion may have higher mean square error due to higher bias of the estimation . in this paper , we take the model misspecification into account . when the fitted model differs from the underlying true model",
    ", a good split - plot design should be able to simultaneously control the variance - covariance matrix and the bias matrix of the estimation .",
    "an appropriate criterion to deal with the model misspecification is the @xmath0-optimal minimax criterion proposed by zhou ( 2001 , 2008 ) , wilmut and zhou ( 2011 ) , lin and zhou ( 2013 ) and yin and zhou ( 2014 ) .",
    "this criterion is usually applied on the construction of the robust completely randomized design for model misspecification . in this paper , we extend the application of the @xmath0-optimal minimax criterion to the split - plot designs and provide a general form of the loss function used by this criterion .",
    "this general form of the loss function allows us apply the @xmath0-optimal minimax criterion to selecting optimal design for split - plot experiments or completely randomized experiments with or without model misspecification .",
    "to more efficiently construct and search for the robust split - plot design , we combine the point - exchange algorithm proposed by goos and vandebroek ( 2001 ) and the anneal algorithm proposed by zhou ( 2001 ) .",
    "the update formulas suggested by arnouts and goos ( 2010 ) are applied to increasing the computing speed for calculating the loss function for the @xmath0-optimal minimax criterion .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . section  [ se : cri ] introduces the split - plot design and the @xmath0-optimal minimax criterion with the general form of the loss function , which can be used for selecting robust split - plot designs or completely randomized designs .",
    "section  [ se : au ] provides an algorithm which combines the point - exchange algorithm and the anneal algorithm for constructing and selecting the robust split - plot design for model misspecification .",
