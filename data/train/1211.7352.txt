    "the transfer of the intensity and polarization of radiation propagating in a relativistic magnetized plasma has been a long standing problem which still remains incompletely solved .",
    "its potential diagnostic applications have long been known @xcite and it has recently attracted renewed interest @xcite in connection with the study of the magnetic field structure of synchrotron emitting objects where the high - energy emitting particles may constitute the bulk of the plasma .",
    "polarization data constrain the structure of geometrically complex sources and of their magnetospheres .",
    "astrophysical environments such as the vicinity of the central black hole in the milky way @xcite , jet - sources , galactic @xcite or extragalactic @xcite , pulsars @xcite or disks around black holes @xcite have been studied by these methods .",
    "the perspectives of using polarization data to constrain magnetic fields have improved strongly by the deployment of the low frequency array , lofar , @xcite , and will blossom with the advent of square kilometer array , ska , @xcite , ranging from the largest scales @xcite to the smallest ones @xcite .",
    "using polarization data for the reconstruction of the magnetic field distribution in volume from multiwavelengths observations of relativistically hot astrophysical media rests on the availability of good polarization tranfer codes and on the knowledge of the transfer coefficients that would modify the intensity and the polarization of light as it propagates in the medium .",
    "synchrotron radiation plays an important role in the emission of magnetized high - energy sources .",
    "the polarization properties of its emission and absorption caused by the high - energy population are well known .",
    "the non - dissipative transfer coefficients of faraday rotation and faraday conversion from circular to linear polarization have been more difficult to derive .",
    "substancial progress has nevertheless been achieved in time @xcite .",
    "however , the polarization transfer coefficients for high harmonic numbers have not been generally expressed yet in a manner similar to the dissipative transfer coefficients that involve , for any given distribution function , the integral of the product of some derivative of it with a well - defined energy- and direction - dependent kernel .",
    "such an expression would be most useful for use in data inversion codes .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain such expressions for the polarization transfer coefficients in a relativistic homogeneous magnetized plasma for any distribution function and provide efficient means to calculate the general two - variable kernel .",
    "these expressions are reduced to simple one - variable quadratures for isotropic distributions and for a large class of non - isotropic ones as well .",
    "the derivation of these results parallels that of dissipative transfer coefficients .",
    "it is based on an expression of the high frequency conductivity tensor of a magnetized relativistic plasma that has not been hitherto used in this context and involves , at some late stage of the derivation , well - justified approximations that allow us to explicitly sum series of principal parts in the limit of large harmonics numbers .",
    "our results are shown to exactly coincide with previously known exact results in the case of thermal distributions .",
    "section  [ derivation ] summarizes the basics of polarized radiation transfer in a uniformly magnetized medium .",
    "section  [ secresults ] presents in anticipation the end results of our derivation of the polarization transfer coefficients as a double regular quadrature and illustrates it for isotropic and anisotropic distributions , where it can sometimes be reduced to a single quadrature .",
    "this unconventional presentation has been chosen because the derivation of these results from those in section  [ derivation ] , which is carried in section  [ secderivation ] and section  [ sec : nr - qr ] , is mathematical in some respects , as many previous contributions to this subject @xcite .",
    "the reader who would like to closely follow the derivations presented in sections [ secderivation ] and [ sec : nr - qr ] is invited to consult the series of appendices that are available in the on - line version of this paper only .",
    "sections [ secderivation ] and [ sec : nr - qr ] can be skipped on a first read .",
    "section [ seclowfrequencylimit ] focuses on analytical results applicable to isotropic distribution functions in the low - frequency ( lf ) limit .",
    "section  [ secdiscussion ] wraps up .",
    "this section briefly establishes ab initio some known results concerning the description of polarized radiation transfer in a uniformly magnetized medium and the associated derivation of the high - frequency electrical conductivity from which the elements of the transfer matrix are obtained .",
    "meanwhile , we set our notations and specify the nature of the large harmonic number approximation on which this work is based .",
    "the polarization properties of transverse electromagnetic radiation are represented by a column vector of four stokes parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 denoting the transpose of the matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the stokes vector @xmath3 depends on the frequency and direction of propagation of the radiation , as well as on the point in space and on the time at which it is observed . in the limit where the frequency is higher than any gyrofrequency",
    ", the stokes vector satisfies a radiative transfer equation in which the generalized emission coefficient is a four - component column vector @xmath4 and the generalized absorption coefficient is a 4@xmath54 transfer matrix .",
    "this transfer equation can be written , for radiation of frequency @xmath6 and group velocity ( based on an isotropic mean conductivity ) @xmath7 as : @xmath8 the four matrix elements @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the emission column vector @xmath13 result from dissipative effects .",
    "the emission column vector @xmath13 represents the emission rate and polarization of the spontaneously emitted radiation .",
    "the elements @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 of the transfer matrix result from non - dissipative effects caused by the slowly varying phase difference between different transverse components of the electric vector of the radiation .",
    "the elements of the matrix in equation  ( [ lequationdetransfert ] ) can be expressed in terms of the components of the high - frequency conductivity tensor @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( [ lequationdetransfert ] ) has been established by a number of authors and by different methods @xcite . a direct derivation of the absorption - like term is presented below .",
    "the derivation of the emission term is less straightforward @xcite .",
    "since the wavelengths of the plasma eigenmodes of a given frequency @xmath6 do not differ by much from each other at high frequency , their phase difference evolves slowly in space and time . as a result",
    ", the correlations between these phases , which determine the state of polarization , are maintained over a length much longer than the wavelength , justifying a radiative transfer approach .",
    "when the plasma frequency @xmath18 exceeds by much the gyrofrequencies @xmath19 of all particle species @xmath20 , the wavelengths of the eigenmodes still differ by a little amount when @xmath21 although the dispersion relation may depart from the vacuum one when @xmath6 is of order @xmath18 . in any other case ,",
    "the difference of the phases of the eigenmodes evolves on a wavelength scale and the radiative transfer approach is inappropriate .",
    "assuming there are only two eigenmodes with transverse components , if their phases would be correlated at some point and time , the rapid growth of their difference would reduce this correlation to nothing in only a few wavelengths .",
    "thus , the polarization state of radiation supported by modes of largely different wavelengths for a given frequency reduces to that of the sum of two mutually incoherent eigenmodes .",
    "equation  ( [ lequationdetransfert ] ) is then only relevant in the high - frequency limit , @xmath21 .",
    "it can be written in this form in the weakly anisotropic medium approximation , in which the wave dispersion is approximated by neglecting the longitudinal component of partially transverse eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "we now show how the elements of the absorption matrix relate to those of the conductivity tensor .",
    "we start from the propagation equation of the electric field @xmath22 , deduced from maxwell s equations : @xmath23 our equations are written in the mksa system of units , where @xmath24 is the dielectric permittivity of vacuum and @xmath25 its magnetic permeability .",
    "the velocity of light in vacuo is @xmath26 . in equation ( [ propagcrue ] )",
    ", @xmath27 is the electric field and @xmath28 the current density .",
    "the electric field is assumed to be transverse , so that @xmath29 , which is a good approximation at high frequencies .",
    "the microscopic electric field is then fourier expanded , its complex vectorial amplitude @xmath30 being regarded as slowly depending on space and time , which is equivalent to coarse graining in fourier space . the electric current density @xmath31 is similarly expanded .",
    "the phase , and possibly the amplitude , of the microscopic electric field is a random variable . omitting the indices @xmath32 for simplicity",
    ", each term of the fourier expansion can be written as @xmath33 the current in equation  ( [ propagcrue ] ) is the sum of an induced current @xmath34 , which results from the electric field @xmath22 and a spontaneous current @xmath35 , the microcurrent created by the individual plasma particles , which gives rise to spontaneous emission , while the induced current gives rise to the absorption - like term in equation  ( [ lequationdetransfert ] ) .",
    "this latter part of the current is given in terms of the electric field by a linear non - local and causal conductivity tensor operator : @xmath36 in the weakly anisotropic medium approximation , the conductivity operator can be split into a scalar isotropic part , @xmath37 , and a tensorial anisotropic part @xmath38 .",
    "the isotropic part may , for example , represent the dispersive properties of a cold population of relatively large density , neglecting the magnetization of these particles .",
    "an isotropic conductivity has no effect on the polarization but affects the propagation properties of electromagnetic waves .",
    "no component of the conductivity need to be separated out when the propagation is represented well enough by the vacuum dispersion relation .",
    "the tensorial anisotropic part consists of the anisotropic residual of the conductivity , not included in @xmath37 , and of the conductivity of populations which negligibly contribute to the dispersive properties of the plasma waves .",
    "the frequency @xmath6 supposedly being much larger than all gyrofrequencies , the component @xmath38 must be small .",
    "its contribution to the dispersion properties may be neglected but it nevertheless contributes to the polarization transfer matrix .",
    "the form of the electric field in equation  ( [ quasimono ] ) is inserted in equations ( [ propagcrue ] ) and ( [ conductoperator ] ) .",
    "when acting on the imaginary exponential phase factor the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 are of order @xmath6 and @xmath41 respectively , but when acting on the slowly varying amplitude @xmath42 they are of order @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 being the time and length scales on which @xmath47 varies , which are much longer than the wave period and wavelength . only the terms of first order in @xmath48 and @xmath49 are retained . for consistency , this requires that @xmath50 in equation  ( [ conductoperator ] ) be expanded as : @xmath51 the time and space integrations in equation  ( [ conductoperator ] ) then involve the fourier transforms of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( no index @xmath56 ) , the latter being a tensor , and the derivatives of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath58 .",

    "the three subdominant terms in equation  ( [ propagqmbrut1 ] ) reduce to : @xmath63 where the amplitude @xmath47 , which slowly varies with position and time , is only non - vanishing when the wave vector @xmath58 and the frequency @xmath60 are linked by the dispersion relation in equation  ( [ disprelationisotr ] ) . an equation for the correlation tensor of the electric field of this radiation",
    ", @xmath64 can be derived from equation  ( [ propagcharcute ] ) by tensorial multiplication by @xmath65 , the superscript  @xmath66 denoting complex conjugation , and averaging over the statistical distribution of the phases ( and possibly of the amplitudes ) of the components of @xmath47 .",
    "this operation is represented by brackets .",
    "the electric field supposedly being transverse , it pertains the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction @xmath67 and may be represented by its components on two abitrarily chosen unit basis vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 in this plane .",
    "an intensity tensor with components @xmath70 relative to this basis that is proportional to the two - dimensional electric field correlation tensor must be defined such that it has the dimension of a specific intensity .",
    "we define the stokes parameters of the radiation as being related to this intensity tensor by @xmath71 the transfer equation for the components @xmath70 can be deduced from equation  ( [ propagcharcute ] ) which writes , using the dummy index rule @xmath72 by equation  ( [ stokesdecorrtensor ] ) , the term on the right of equation  ( [ eqproppolarinduit ] ) can be be converted into the transfer matrix term in equation  ( [ lequationdetransfert ] ) , some elements of which turn out to involve the hermitian ( dissipative ) part of the conductivity while others involve its anti - hermitian ( non - dissipative ) part .",
    "these parts are respectively defined by : @xmath73 the elements of the transfer matrix in equation  ( [ lequationdetransfert ] ) are given in terms of these parts of the conductivity by : @xmath74 these matrix elements refer to the components of the local conductivity for the wave vector @xmath75 and frequency @xmath76 related to it by the dispersion relation in equation  ( [ disprelationisotr ] ) .",
    "the relations in equation ( [ coeffdesigmaha ] ) between the transfer coefficients and the elements of the conductivity matrix agree with those in @xcite given the relation between conductivity and dielectric tensors for perturbations varying as in equation ( [ quasimono ] ) and accounting for the fact , mentioned above , that their definition of the stokes parameter @xmath77 differs from ours by a sign .",

    "limit , when qr contributions to these integrals are negligible , the transfer coefficients can be more simply written as @xmath557 within the hf limit , these expressions are also completely general .",
    "the integrands in equations ( [ ffinalpisigma ] ) and ( [ hfinalpisigma ] ) are more regular than those in equations ( [ fexactsummary])([hfinalpisigma ] ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath153 in equations ( [ ffinalpisigma ] ) and ( [ hfinalpisigma ] ) , although it is meant to cover the nr domain only , extends in the hf limit to the full physical domain by lack of a qr contribution , the @xmath558 domain then being ill - populated .",
    "we have particularized equations ( [ ffinalpisigma ] ) and ( [ hfinalpisigma ] ) to a number of different physical situations . for isotropic distribution functions they reduce to equations ( [ fisotfinal ] ) and ( [ hisotfinal ] ) , which coincide with known results for thermal distribution functions , as shown in section  [ sec : thermal ] .",
    "a quadrupolar anisotropy , represented by a distribution functions as in equation ( [ eq : ansaztfaniso ] ) , produces the transfer coefficients shown in equations ( [ fanisotfinal ] ) and ( [ hanisotfinal ] ) while anisotropies of higher multipolar orders generate the coefficients compiled in appendix  [ app : anisotrotropic ] . in all these cases , the expression of the transfer coefficients is reduced to a one - variable quadrature over the energy of the particles . for anisotropies that can not be expanded in a sum of a few multipolar terms ,",
    "the hf coefficients are obtained by performing the double integrals in equations ( [ ffinalpisigma ] ) and ( [ hfinalpisigma ] ) , either in these variables or in others , as shown in the case of a beam in section  [ sec : beam ] .",
    "the hf approximation progressively loses validity as the fraction of particles with a lorentz factor @xmath108 large enough to interact with the wave in the lf mode increases .",
    "a regime change occurs when the qr contribution ceases to be negligible , which , for a given frequency and a given direction of propagation , happens for lorentz factors such that their characteristic synchrotron frequency , defined in equation ( [ defomegacritsynch ] ) , is of the order of or larger than the frequency of the radiation considered .",
    "we offer clear physical and mathematical explanations for this behaviour , that has been previously well observed in the results of @xcite and @xcite : the regime change occurs when particles in quasi - resonance make a contribution comparable to the nr one . from a mathematical standpoint",
    ", the two - variable kernels in equations ( [ fexactsummary ] ) and ( [ hexactsummary ] ) must be represented differently in these two regimes , in terms of nicholson s approximations for quasi - resonance or in terms of the debye expansion of high order bessel functions for non - resonance .    in full generality , the qr contributions to the transfer coefficients are given by equations ( [ fqr ] ) and ( [ hqr ] ) .",
    "the qr contribution to @xmath155 is however better expressed as in equation ( [ hqrreduit ] ) .",
    "when qr contributions are important , the nr and qr contributions should eventually be added and care should be taken to integrate the qr contributions in equations ( [ fqr ] ) and ( [ hqrreduit ] ) over the qr domain only and the nr contributions in equations ( [ ffinalpisigma ] ) and ( [ hfinalpisigma ] ) over the nr domain only . we have compared the qr and nr contributions to the faraday coefficients in section  [ comparqrnr ] , and shown that in the lf limit none of them predominates . for a given frequency , the qr contribution to the faraday conversion coefficient @xmath155 grows when @xmath471 to a value comparable to , and in fact numerically larger than , the nr one . in the limit of large energies , the angular integration over the qr domain covers a very small interval in pitch angle space , as can be seen from equation ( [ conditionsqr ] ) . across this interval ,",
    "the partial derivative @xmath416 usually varies by only a little amount .",
    "our estimation in section  [ comparqrnr ] of @xmath450 is for this reason expected to be a reliable one , that can be written in the lf limit as @xmath559 equation ( [ khqrsidominant ] ) is one among different contributions to @xmath155 .",
    "it is is meant to apply only to values of @xmath150 that are relevant to the asymptotic lf limit .",
    "it is otherwise general and valid for any distribution function whatever the pitch angle distribution , the latter being anyway irrelevant to the qr contribution .",
    "the complication of accounting for both nr and qr contributions has been overcome for isotropic distribution functions by actually calculating their sum in the lf limit .",
    "this has lead to the results in equations ( [ defnoyauxisotropes ] ) , ( [ flfdetail ] ) and ( [ kernelisotroplowfreq ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic lf contribution to the faraday coefficients is in this case @xmath560 these simple analytical results , which apply to the asymptotic lf regime @xmath561 , do not seem to have appeared so far in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite provide intermediate and lf regime fits to numerical results .",
    "for application to specific distributions functions , equations ( [ fexacteanticip ] ) and ( [ hexactanticip ] ) , ( [ fcoupure ] ) and ( [ hcoupure ] ) , ( [ ffinalpisigma ] ) and ( [ hfinalpisigma ] ) or ( [ khqrsidominant ] ) may of course be expressed in terms of any set of physical variables , such as the lorentz factor @xmath108 and pitch angle @xmath109 of the particles , as was partly done in sections [ secisotrope ] and [ secanisotrope ] .",
    "we proposed in equations ( [ fisointerpol])([hisointerpol ] ) approximate expressions of the kernels of the faraday coefficients for isotropic distribution functions that interpolate between the hf regime and the asymptotic lf one .",
    "these approximations to the kernels generate reasonably accurate expressions of the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath155 that can be written in the form of a simple one - variable quadrature over the entire energy range . in the hf limit , we have similarly reduced to a one - variable quadrature on energy the expression of the faraday coefficients for a large class of anisotropic distribution functions proportional to legendre polynomials of low degree depending on the cosine of the pitch angle .",
    "these functions may be used as a basis for expanding distribution functions of any simple kind of anisotropy . for distribution functions with sharp anisotropies",
    "our results can be made completely explicit by performing a double integration over energy and angle .",
    "our analytical results have been deduced from a new , but straightforward , calculation of the anti - hermitian part of the conductivity tensor expressed in a form in which the usual sum over discrete synchrotron resonances is exactly replaced by an integration over a continuous variable .",
    "this particular representation of the conductivity tensor has not been hitherto used in this context .",
    "the integral over this continuous variable has principal value singularities that can be exactly reduced to the sum of a regular part and of a residual part that has been shown to be safely negligible . as a result ,",
    "simple , general , quasi - exact and non - singular expressions for the transfer coefficients have been obtained in a form that parallels that of the familiar expressions of the synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients , but differs from the form in which faraday coefficients are usually expressed in the literature .",
    "not - withstanding this difference our results exactly coincide with known exact ones for thermal distributions .",
    "unlike the hermitian part of the conductivity , which describes synchrotron absorption , the anti - hermitian part is never dominated by the contribution of a small qr population travelling close to the direction of propagation of the considered wave . on the contrary ,",
    "nr particles make most of the contribution to the non - dissipative coefficients in the hf limit and can not be ignored otherwise .",
    "the transfer properties of relativistic plasmas may sensibly differ from those of cold plasmas , which may be a useful diagnostic .",
    "for example , the faraday rotation coefficient @xmath92 of a symmetric pair plasma , with equal densities of electrons and positrons having identical distribution functions , exactly vanishes but its faraday conversion coefficient @xmath155 does not .",
    "the study of a field - aligned beam in section  [ sec : beam ] also revealed that the faraday rotation coefficient is enhanced in this case for radiation travelling in the beam .",
    "the knowledge of transport coefficients in all physical regimes , hf or lf , should allow optimal use of inversion algorithms of multiwavelength polarization data to yield the density and magnetic structure of the source and of the intervening medium .",
    "the reconstruction of the magnetic field distribution in volume , from multiwavelength polarization observations of synchrotron emitting astrophysical media , has been attempted either partially ( faraday synthesis ; * ? ? ? * ) or fully @xcite , but in the latter case assuming a known distribution of the electronic population(s ) responsible for the synchrotron emission and/or the faraday rotation . in the case of cold plasmas (",
    "e.g. the interstellar medium of our galaxy or nearby galaxies ) where the circular polarization is negligible ( both from emission and transfer ) , these assumptions about the underlying electronic spatial distribution(s ) are a real limitation to reconstructing the magnetic field structure .",
    "however , it was also shown @xcite that in the case of relativistic sources where a single electronic distribution would be responsible for both synchrotron emission and radiative transfer effects ( through their contribution to the dielectric properties of the plasma ) , the multiwavelength observation of circular polarization ( in addition to intensity and linear polarization ) should in principle allow the simultaneous reconstruction of the magnetic field _ and _ electronic spatial distributions . in this context , the faraday rotation and conversion coefficients derived in this work are of particular interest .",
    "the diagnostic of relativistic jets from galactic nuclei and of pulsar winds by these methods would be of particular interest .",
    "it should be noted however that our present results only yield the transfer coefficients in the plasma rest frame and should be transformed to the observer s frame for use in the inversion algorithm for example along the lines described by @xcite .",

    "<S> the polarization transfer coefficients of a relativistic magnetized plasma are derived . </S>",
    "<S> these results apply to any momentum distribution function of the particles , isotropic or anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> particles interact with the radiation either in a non - resonant mode when the frequency of the radiation exceeds their characteristic synchrotron emission frequency , or quasi - resonantly otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> these two classes of particles contribute differently to the polarization transfer coefficients . for a given frequency </S>",
    "<S> , this dichotomy corresponds to a regime change in the dependence of the transfer coefficients on the parameters of the particle s population , since these parameters control the relative weight of the contribution of each class of particles . </S>",
    "<S> our results apply to either regimes as well as the intermediate one . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the transfer coefficients involves an exact expression of the conductivity tensor of the relativistic magnetized plasma that has not been used hitherto in this context . </S>",
    "<S> suitable expansions valid at frequencies much larger than the cyclotron frequency allow us to analytically perform the summation over all resonances at high harmonics of the relativistic gyrofrequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the transfer coefficients are represented in the form of two - variable integrals that can be conveniently computed for any set of parameters by using olver s expansion of high - order bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> we particularize our results to a number of distribution functions , isotropic , thermal or power - law , with different multipolar anisotropies of low order , or strongly beamed . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , earlier exact results for thermal distributions are recovered . for isotropic distributions , </S>",
    "<S> the faraday coefficients are expressed in the form of a one - variable quadrature over energy , for which we provide the kernels in the high - frequency limit and in the asymptotic low - frequency limit . </S>",
    "<S> an interpolation formula extending over the full energy range is proposed for these kernels . a similar reduction to a one - variable quadrature over energy </S>",
    "<S> is derived at high frequency for a large class of anisotropic distribution functions that may form a basis on which any smoothly anisotropic distribution could be expanded .    </S>",
