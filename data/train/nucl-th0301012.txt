    "<S> the strong interaction effects of isospin- and spin - dependent nucleon - nucleon correlations observed in many - body calculations are interpreted in terms of a one - pion exchange mechanism . including such effects in computations of nuclear parity violating effects </S>",

    "<S> a larger effect arises from the one - boson exchange nature of the parity non - conserving nucleon - nucleon interaction , which depends on both weak and strong meson - nucleon coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> using values of the latter that are constrained by nucleon - nucleon phase shifts leads to enhancements of parity violation by factors close to two . </S>",

    "<S> the parity non - conserving nn potential , @xmath1 of desplanques , donoghue and holstein ( ddh ) @xcite , constructed so that the only unknown quantities are the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants , which govern the strength of the weak meson - nucleon vertex function , has been the standard tool to analyze these data because the parity - violating observables have been expressed as linear combinations of these , presumably fundamental , weak coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in various reviews @xcite , a problem occurs because different values of the weak coupling constants are needed to describe different experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath0cs anapole moment requires a pion - nucleon weak coupling constant @xmath2 that is larger than that predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but the observation of circularly polarized @xmath3 rays in the decay of @xmath4f data require a very small value for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a recent analysis of heavy compound nuclei@xcite finds parity violating effects that are larger ( by factors @xmath5 ) than those predicted using ddh potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we next explain why the results of nuclear structure calculations @xcite cause us to examine the effects of spin - isospin , nucleon - nucleon , correlations on parity violation . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear parity violating effects have been typically analyzed in terms of a parity - violating single nucleon shell model potential , constructed from the ddh potential using a hartree - fock approximation and rpa correlations ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , two - particle - two - hole correlations are known to be as vital elements of nuclear structure . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - independent effects of the short range correlations are often incorporated @xcite using the miller - spencer correlation function@xcite , but this does not take into account all of the correlation effects@xcite .    in particular , recent variational studies of nuclear matter @xcite and @xmath6o @xcite have demonstrated that spin - isospin correlations are very important . to be specific , </S>",
    "<S> consider two - nucleon pair correlation functions defined by the expectation values _ </S>",

    "<S> other operators @xmath13 cause much smaller effects and are ignored here .    </S>",
    "<S> what is the impact of spin - isospin correlations on calculations of parity - violating observables ? consider the construction of the single - particle pnc potential @xmath14 which governs the interaction between a valence nucleon @xmath15 with a spin 0@xmath16 core . in using the hartree - fock approximation , </S>",
    "<S> one folds the operator @xmath17 with the density matrix of the core . </S>",
    "<S> the pion exchange term contains the operator @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents the core nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of this operator vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> but if one includes spin - isospin correlations , the relevant matrix elements include a factor @xmath20 , and the product @xmath21 contains a non - vanishing term , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a new non - vanishing contribution will appear .    </S>",
    "<S> the starting point for our evaluation of the pnc single - particle potential is the effective parity - violating nucleon - nucleon potential@xcite between two nucleons ( i , j ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the nucleon mass , @xmath25,\\;$ ] @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> we wish to incorporate is that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ddh ] ) is not the complete pnc interaction between two - nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the pnc potential acting once , occurs in the midst of all orders of the strong potential , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting pnc reaction matrix @xmath31 is a generalization of the bruckner reaction matrix and is given by : & & g^pnc(e)= ^(e ) v^pnc(e),[2pt ] + & & ( e)=1 + qe - h_0v(e ) = 1 + qe - h_0g(e),[om]where @xmath32 is an energy to be discussed below , and @xmath33 is an operator which projects onto unoccupied states .    </S>",
    "<S> our focus is on a first estimate of the effects of spin - isospin correlations . </S>",

    "<S> [ pvu ]    the goal of this work is to assess the influence of tensor and spin dependent correlation effects on calculations of pnc observables . </S>",
    "<S> since these are usually ignored , performing a schematic calculation seems appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> it might seem easiest to parameterize the different contributions to @xmath35 as function of @xmath36 , the procedure of miller & spencer . </S>",
    "<S> such a strategy will not work here , with the emphasis on finding hitherto neglected contributions to the direct term . to see this consider the terms of the ddh potential of the form @xmath37\\sim   { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}}\\cdot \\bfr$ ] . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ pvu ] ) would involve a vanishing volume integral of @xmath39 times a function of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the pv effective potential arises from the dependence of @xmath35 on the relative momentum = ( * p*- ) /2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the spin - isospin correlations arises from the exchange of pions @xcite , so we separate the potential @xmath30 into a one pion exchange term , @xmath40 and a remainder approximated as being a central potential , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we include the effects of the central potential ( which include the short - distance repulsion ) to all orders and keeps terms of first - order in @xmath40 . </S>",

    "<S> this is in contrast with many other nuclear structure effects which reduce the effects of pnc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present results constitute an argument that the effects of spin - isospin correlations need to be included in quantitative calculations of pnc effects , but are not large enough to not have a major impact@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , uncertainties due to nuclear structure effects might not have a large impact on pnc observables .    </S>",
    "<S> but there is a more obvious source of change to present evaluations . </S>",
    "<S> examination of the ddh potential , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> is equivalent to increasing the coefficient of the terms proportional to @xmath74 by a factor of 1.9 . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of using values such as those of table i have been noticed previously@xcite .    1.8 cm    ( 6,6)(-0,-6.2 )    to make a first assessment of the impact of this finding , we revise the results of table vii and fig .  9 of ref </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath60tl result with its large error band is almost consistent with that set of parameters , but the @xmath0cs , and @xmath60tl experimental results are not compatible , as pointed out earlier@xcite . the results from compound nuclei are typically not shown in plots such as fig .  2 , but using the bonn parameters of table i , would reduce the discrepancies between theory and experiment .    the constraints arising from @xmath78 scattering experiments are not shown in fig .  2 , </S>",
    "<S> because currently interpreted provides constraints very similar to that of the @xmath79f experiment , and the calculations are not not complete . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath14 , which should be complex , is treated as real . </S>",
    "<S> but it is worth remarking that an @xmath80 experiment would provide very different constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the parity violation predicted using the original ddh potential is very small due to a cancellation between the pionic and vector meson exchange terms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the bonn coupling constants ( table  i ) leads to a value of @xmath81 ( see eq .  ( 18 ) of @xcite ) instead of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this would be increased further by using a smaller value of @xmath2 ( indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) than the ddh `` best guess value '' of ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 .    </S>",
    "<S> the ranges of weak - coupling constants covered by fig .  2 are roughly consistent with the ddh `` reasonable ranges '' and the same coupling constants account for much of the data , except for that of @xmath0cs . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes some success in explaining pnc phenomena , but the main improvement obtained here by using larger strong coupling constants could itself be true only within one - boson exchange models . </S>",
    "<S> all such models have large values of @xmath69 and @xmath85 , but two - boson exchange models have smaller values of @xmath85@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the one - boson - exchange approach is not consistent with the present state of the art treatments of nucleon - nucleon scattering , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an appropriate treatment of pnc effects is one which involves incorporating pnc effects within an updated treatment of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , holstein has recently advocated an effective field theory treatment@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus our summary is that the present results demonstrate the need for an improved , updated , consistent incorporation of strong and weak interaction effects , and also indicate that the nuclear structure uncertainties might not be very severe . </S>",
    "<S> thus the improvement of calculations of nuclear pnc effects seems to be an interesting and feasible task , even though much remains to be done . </S>"
