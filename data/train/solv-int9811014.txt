    "at the turn of the century there was an interest in finding new functions defined by differential equations ; this led to the discovery of the six  equations @xcite , @xmath3 .",
    "these six ordinary differential equations ( odes ) were discovered through a classification of second order odes of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is rational in @xmath6 , algebraic in @xmath7 and analytic in @xmath8 , whose solutions have no movable branch points . here",
    "a singularity is said to be movable if its location in the complex plane depends on constants of integration .",
    "the requirement made was thus one of single - valuedness of solutions except at fixed singularities ; this property is today referred to as the  property .",
    "in addition to defining new transcendental functions , the six  equations have a number of other remarkable properties .",
    "for example , they can each be written as the compatibility condition of a corresponding linear system , which then allows them to be solved using the inverse monodromy transform method @xcite .",
    "also , at least for @xmath0@xmath9 , they have a variety of transformations and special integrals ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is the derivation of these last two properties , but for a hierarchy of higher order odes , that we are interested in here .",
    "as an example , consider the second  equation , @xmath0 , v-2v^3-vx-=0 .",
    "[ p2 ] this has the well - known  transformation v = v + , = - [ p2btb ] where @xmath10 , and where @xmath11 satisfies @xmath0 with parameter @xmath12 , that is @xmath13\\equiv \\~v''-2\\~v^3-\\~vx-\\a=0.\\ ] ]    the second  equation @xmath0 ( [ p2 ] ) also has special integrals for certain choices of the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "for example , with @xmath15 we have the special integral @xcite i_1/2 v-v^2-x = 0 [ i11 ] which , modulo @xmath0 with @xmath15 , satisfies the relation @xmath16 the riccati equation ( [ i11 ] ) can be linearised via @xmath17 to yield  + x=0 , [ peq1 ] which thus gives the well - known airy function solutions of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the  transformation ( [ p2btb ] ) , together with the discrete symmetry @xmath18 , then allows us to derive special integrals @xmath19 with @xmath20 , for any integer @xmath21 . similarly ,",
    "rational solutions can be constructed for integer values of @xmath14 , beginning with the trivial solution @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "later we will see a little known connection between the sequence of special integrals ( airy function solutions ) , and this sequence of rational solutions .",
    "modern - day interest in the  equations was to a large extent sparked by the observation of ablowitz and segur @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that they arise as similarity reductions of many completely integrable partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "the generalised symmetries of such pdes then give immediately a means of writing down higher order odes that may define new transcendental functions .",
    "these form hierarchies of odes obtained as similarity reductions of hierarchies of completely integrable pdes .",
    "however , although examples have been written down ( see for example @xcite ) , it is only recently that much interest has been shown in such odes @xcite .",
    "the question of whether some of the higher order odes obtained in this way define new functions remains to be answered . answering this question",
    "is made more difficult by the fact that since the time of  only restricted progress has been made in the systematic ( order by order ) classification of odes having the  property .",
    "we do not address this particular question in the present work .",
    "we are interested instead in the question of how to obtain  transformations and special integrals for hierarchies of odes . here",
    "we consider one particular hierarchy , the @xmath0 hierarchy @xcite , which is obtained by similarity reduction from the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) hierarchy .",
    "we show that the so - called  truncation method , a technique commonly applied to pdes @xcite , can not be applied directly to odes .",
    "we show how these difficulties can be overcome , and accordingly modify the pde approach in order to obtain systematically the auto-  transformations presented ( without derivation ) in @xcite ; these results provide a generalisation of ( [ p2btb ] ) above . using these results we are able to find sequences of special integrals for the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "such special integrals have not been presented before for higher members of this hierarchy .",
    "we also give a  transformation relating the @xmath0 hierarchy to another hierarchy of odes , namely a @xmath1 hierarchy ( so called because its first member is equivalent to equation xxxiv of chapter 14 in @xcite , which is commonly referred to as @xmath1 ) .",
    "in addition we show how to obtain a little known transformation ( due to gambier @xcite ) for @xmath0 itself .",
    "this last allows us to relate solutions of @xmath0 with parameter value @xmath15 to solutions of @xmath0 with parameter value @xmath23 .",
    "the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) hierarchy can be written as u_t_2n+1 + _ x _n+1[u ] = 0 , n=0,1,2 ,  , [ kdv ] where @xmath25 , and the sequence @xmath26 satisfies the lenard recursion relation @xcite @xmath27 beginning with @xmath28 = \\tfr12 $ ] , this then gives @xmath29 = u , \\qquad \\l_2[u ] = u_{xx } + 3 u^2 , \\qquad \\l_3[u ] = u_{xxxx } + 10 u u_{xx } + 5 u_x^2 + 10 u^3,\\ ] ] and so on .",
    "the mkdv hierarchy is obtained from the kdv hierarchy via the miura map @xmath30 , and can be written as w_t_2n+1+_x(_x+2w)_n[w_x - w^2]=0 , n=0,1,2,  [mkdvh ] the @xmath0 hierarchy @xcite is obtained from this equation via the similarity reduction @xmath31^{{1}/(2n+1 ) } } , \\qquad x = \\frac{x}{[(2n+1)t_{2n+1}]^{{1}/(2n+1)}},\\ ] ] which gives ^(n)[v,_n](+2v)_n[v-v^2]-vx-_n=0 , n=1,2,3,  [p2h ] where we have excluded the trivial case @xmath32 from consideration .",
    "we note for future reference that the @xmath0 hierarchy has the discrete symmetry @xmath33 , inherited from the associated discrete symmetry @xmath34 of the mkdv hierarchy .    since @xmath35=u$ ] we see that the first member of this hierarchy is the second  equation ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "the next member of this hierarchy is the fourth order equation ^(2)[v,_2 ] v-10v^2v-10v(v)^2 + 6v^5-xv-_2=0 .",
    "[ p24 ] in what follows , our results on  transformations and special integrals will all be presented in general , i.e.  for any member of the @xmath0 hierarchy . however , in order to provide concrete examples , we will also give specific results in the special cases @xmath36 , i.e.  @xmath0 ( [ p2 ] ) , and @xmath37 , i.e.  @xmath38 ( [ p24 ] ) .",
    "for pdes important information can be obtained using a so - called truncated expansion @xcite . here",
    "we consider the application of this technique to odes , and the modifications that must be made in order to extract information about  transformations .",
    "we take as our example the @xmath0 hierarchy ( [ p2h ] ) .",
    "we begin by making the change of variables v= , [ str ] which gives ( + ) _n - x-_n=0 , n=1,2,  [se ] where @xmath39 is the schwarzian derivative of @xmath40 .",
    "since the schwarzian derivative is invariant under the action of the mbius group , setting @xmath41 gives v=-+ [ vphi ] which is a solution of the @xmath0 hierarchy ( [ p2h ] ) provided that ( + -2 ) _n- ( -2)x-_n=0 , n=1,2, ",
    "[e19 ] it then follows that @xmath42 given by v=-+v , [ tr ] where v = , [ vt ] is a solution of the @xmath0 hierarchy ( [ p2h ] ) provided that ( + 2v -2 ) _n[v-v^2 ] -(v-)x-_n=0 , n=1,2, ",
    "[ptr ] holds .",
    "equation ( [ ptr ] ) , or equivalently equation ( [ e19 ] ) , is the result of substituting a truncated  expansion into the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "the expansion for the principal family @xmath43 has resonances at @xmath44 , at @xmath45 , and at @xmath46 ( these are the same as those for the corresponding family of the mkdv hierarchy @xcite , with the omission of that at @xmath47 , which arises from the extra differentiation of the dominant terms in ( [ mkdvh ] ) ) .",
    "substitution of the truncated expansion ( [ tr ] ) into the @xmath0 hierarchy therefore leads at @xmath48 to the determination of @xmath11 as given by ( [ vt ] ) , and then at @xmath49 we find that all coefficients vanish since these correspond to the resonances @xmath45 .",
    "we are then left with the terms at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and it is these terms that are given by ( [ ptr ] ) .    setting coefficients of different powers of @xmath52 to zero",
    "independently then gives _n[v-v^2]-x=0 [ 3a ] and ( + 2v)_n[v-v^2]-v x -_n=0 .",
    "[ 3b ] together these two equations imply that we must have @xmath53 .",
    "the result of using a truncated  expansion is therefore that if @xmath11 satisfies ( [ 3a ] ) , then @xmath42 given by ( [ tr ] ) and ( [ vt ] ) is a solution of ( [ p2h ] ) for @xmath53 .",
    "that is , we obtain a map from ( [ 3a ] ) to ( [ p2h ] ) , though not an auto-  transformation for the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "we do , however , obtain information about special integrals of the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "since @xmath54 , our result is that any solution of @xmath55-\\tfr{1}{2}x=0\\ ] ] provides a solution of ( [ p2h ] ) for @xmath53 .",
    "therefore this defines the special integral @xmath56 , i^(n)_1/2_n[v-v^2]-x=0 .",

    "for @xmath37 we obtain the special integral i^(2)_1/2v-2vv+(v)^2 - 6v^2v+3v^4-x [ i21 ] which provides solutions of ( [ p24 ] ) when @xmath64 .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath36 , this result that the truncated  expansion leads only to special integrals of @xmath0 appears in @xcite .",
    "weiss , again for @xmath36 , attempted to overcome this problem @xcite by considering the symmetries of a particular integral ( the integration constant is set equal to zero ) of equation ( [ se ] ) . in this way he was able to obtain , albeit rather implicitly , the auto-  transformation for @xmath0 . in what follows we give an alternative and altogether much more explicit derivation of the auto-  transformations of the entire @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "thus far we have obtained the special integrals ( [ in1 ] ) of the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "special integrals in the case @xmath65 are obtained using the discrete symmetry @xmath66 .",

    "it is clear that in order to do so we need to modify the above truncation approach .",
    "the first point to notice is that equations ( [ p2h ] ) and ( [ 3b ] ) are copies of the @xmath0 hierarchy in @xmath42 and @xmath11 , but with the _ same _ value of the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "yet it is known that auto-  transformations for odes , in particular the equations , may involve changes in the value of any parameters in the ode .",
    "our first step therefore is to assume that @xmath11 is a solution of the @xmath0 hierarchy for a _ different _ choice of parameter , that is ^(n)[v,_n](+2v)_n[v-v^2]-vx-_n=0 , n=1,2,  .",
    "[ p2a ]    we now return to equation ( [ ptr ] ) .",
    "our added assumption that @xmath11 satisfies ( [ p2a ] ) means that we now have a  transformation ( [ tr ] ) from the @xmath0 hierarchy in @xmath68 , ( [ p2a ] ) , to the @xmath0 hierarchy in @xmath69 , ( [ p2h ] ) , provided that ( [ vt ] ) and ( 2_n[v-v^2]-x ) + ( _ n-_n)=0 , n=1,2,  [rh ] hold .",
    "we note now that we can not set all coefficients of different powers of @xmath52 equal to zero in ( [ rh ] ) , since this would force @xmath70 and we would be back where we were before , i.e.  with the standard  truncation .",
    "what we do therefore is to use ( [ rh ] ) to eliminate @xmath52 from our  transformation .",

    ", we can write our  transformation as v = v + , _",
    "n = -_n , [ hbt12 ] where @xmath76 . using this discrete symmetry",
    "is equivalent to using the truncation @xmath77 , that is , the truncation for the second principal family of the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "we note that this  transformation is an involution , if we iterate keeping the same value of @xmath78 .",
    "we also note that it preserves the quantity @xmath79 ; for @xmath11 a solution of ( [ p2a ] ) , we have @xmath80 .",
    "thus we have obtained , using a modification of the truncated  expansion technique , the auto - bcklund transformations of airault @xcite , one for each member of the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "these could now be used to generate sequences of rational solutions for members of the @xmath0 hierarchy or , as we shall see later , sequences of special integrals .",
