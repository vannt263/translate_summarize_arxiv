    "mode conversion in the solar atmosphere has been a problem of interest for many years .",
    "it is important when the plasma @xmath0 , the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure , is close to unity ; this is the region where the sound and alfvn speeds are of comparable magnitude . outside this area",
    "the modes are effectively decoupled , with one behaving like an acoustic wave and the other displaying a strong magnetic nature .",
    "understanding the processes that occur as waves propagate through this @xmath1 layer may in turn tell us the modes involved in coronal heating , and alert us to what we should be searching for observationally .",
    "stein ( 1971 ) presented a full and detailed study of mode conversion across a density step , using the dispersion relations and boundary conditions to calculate transmission and reflection coefficients for fast , slow , and alfvn waves .",
    "the conditions under which the different modes are coupled to each other were also described .",
    "zhugzhda ( 1979 ) and zhugzhda and dzhalilov ( 1981 ; 1982a , b ) tackled the problem analytically , focusing on an isothermal atmosphere , stratified by gravity , and permeated by a uniform vertical magnetic field .",
    "a solution was found in terms of meier - g functions , specifically @xmath2 , allowing transformation coefficients to be found for waves propagating from high @xmath0 , low in the atmosphere , to low @xmath0 , high in the atmosphere .",
    "this study was extended by cally ( 2001 ) , who found that this solution could be expressed fully in terms of the equivalent hypergeometric @xmath3 functions .",
    "reflection , transmission and conversion coefficients were again found for waves incident from below , with another set of coefficients discovered in addition to those found by zhugzhda and dzhalilov ( 1982a ) .",
    "our work uses the same simple one - dimensional set - up as these authors , but instead of studying the propagation from high @xmath0 to low @xmath0 we examine propagation in the opposite direction .",
    "this study takes the form of a numerical investigation backed up by analytical work .",
    "similarly , mclaughlin and hood ( 2006 ) examined the behaviour of a fast magnetoacoustic wave travelling from a low-@xmath0 to a high-@xmath0 plasma , in this case as it approaches a magnetic null point .",
    "as the wave front crosses the @xmath1 region , the fast wave can be seen to partially convert into a slow wave .",
    "further numerical simulations have been carried out in two dimensions @xcite , two - and - a - half dimensions @xcite , and in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "all of these simulations found that the magnetic canopy ( defined to be the isosurface where @xmath4 ) is a crucial factor in mode conversion , along with the attack angle for the incident wave .",
    "this is supported analytically by cally ( 2006 ) , and by bloomfield _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2006 ) who found observational evidence that the dominant wave mode changes from the fast mode to the slow mode as the waves propagate across the magnetic canopy .",
    "however , due to the complex nature of the numerical simulations it is difficult to disentangle individual physical effects .",
    "the simplicity of the model used in our investigation allows a much clearer picture to be built up , greatly aiding the understanding of the processes involved in mode conversion .",
    "this in turn will aid the interpretation of results from more complex models and simulations .",
    "the paper has the following outline . in section  [ basic equations ]",
    "we introduce the mhd equations in the form that we shall be using them , detailing the assumed @xmath5-dependence and the non - dimensionalisation .",
    "the numerical simulations are discussed in section  [ num sims ] , particularly in relation to their agreement with previous analytic studies .",
    "finally we summarise our findings in section  [ conc.sec ] .",
    "throughout we work with the standard ideal mhd equations , namely @xmath6{\\bf v}&=&-{\\bf\\nabla}p+\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\left({\\bf\\nabla}\\times{\\bf b}\\right)\\times{\\bf b}+\\rho{\\bf g},\\\\ \\frac{\\partial{\\bf b}}{\\partial",
    "t}&=&{\\bf\\nabla}\\times\\left({\\bf v}\\times{\\bf b}\\right),\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}+{\\bf\\nabla}\\cdot\\left(\\rho{\\bf v}\\right)&=&0,\\\\ \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+{\\bf v}\\cdot{\\bf\\nabla}\\right)p&=&\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+{\\bf v}\\cdot{\\bf\\nabla}\\right)\\rho,\\\\ p&=&\\frac{r\\rho t}{\\widetilde{\\mu}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the mass density , @xmath8 is the plasma velocity , @xmath9 is the plasma pressure , @xmath10 is the magnetic permeability , @xmath11 is the magnetic field , @xmath12 is gravitational acceleration , @xmath13 is the ratio of specific heats which we take to be @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the universal gas constant , @xmath16 is the temperature , and @xmath17 is the mean molecular weight which takes a value of @xmath18 in the solar atmosphere .      a very simple , uniform , vertical equilibrium magnetic field , @xmath19 , is chosen and the background pressure and density can be calculated from the momentum equation under equilibrium conditions of uniform temperature ( @xmath20 ) and the ideal gas law . @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coronal scale height ( @xmath23 mm ) .",
    "thus the plasma @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) is dependent on @xmath25 , ensuring that our waves will cross the @xmath1 layer .    to study the nature of this propagation we use the linearised mhd equations .",
    "using subscript @xmath26 for equilibrium quantities and subscript @xmath27 for perturbed quantities we have the linearised equation of motion @xmath28 the linearised induction equation @xmath29 the linearised equation of mass continuity @xmath30 and the energy equation @xmath31 henceforth it is assumed that we are working with the linearised equations and subscripts on the perturbed quantities are dropped .      to reduce our problem down to one dimension",
    "we assume that all variables are invariant in @xmath32 , and choose the @xmath5-dependence to be given by trigonometric functions of @xmath33 @xmath34    we also non - dimensionalise all variables by setting @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where a bar denotes a dimensionless quantity and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are constants with the dimensions of the variable they are scaling .",
    "we can then set @xmath51 and @xmath52 , thus our speed is measured in units of @xmath45 which represents a constant background alfvn speed .",
    "we also set @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the plasma @xmath0 at a reference height of zero ; note that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "thus we generate the dimensionless versions of equations  ( [ linmo.eqn])([linen.eqn ] ) . under these scalings @xmath57 ( for example )",
    "refers to @xmath58 ; _ i.e.  _ the time taken for a wave to travel a distance @xmath49 at the reference background alfvn speed .",
    "the bar on quantities is now dropped and it is understood that we are working with dimensionless values .",
    "the linearised equations are @xmath59 these may then be combined to form two second - order wave equations @xmath60 which are in agreement with ferraro and plumpton ( 1958 ) .",
    "this form of the equations is much easier to analyse with the wkb approximation , as is done in section  [ largek.sec ] .",
    "we numerically solve equations  ( [ lineqns.eqn ] ) using the maccormack method .",
    "this is a two - step , predictor - corrector , lax - wendroff method which is second - order accurate in time and space and , for linear harmonic waves , not strongly affected by numerical dispersion or diffusion .",
    "as we wish to study the propagation of waves incident from above , we drive @xmath61 on the upper boundary , where we apply the conditions @xmath62 imposing @xmath61 on the upper boundary means that we are predominantly driving a slow wave .",
    "since the slow wave also has a small component of @xmath63 , the condition @xmath64 means that there is a small component of the fast mode generated ; however , this mode is evanescent and does not propagate . to ensure that our code is as accurate as possible , we use backward differencing for the predictor steps and forward differencing for the corrector steps ; thus we are using the corrected values on the upper boundary .",
    "the simulations are run for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; the end time is chosen so that we stop the simulation just before the wave front hits the lower boundary thus eliminating reflection effects . in all simulations ,",
    "we choose @xmath67 and @xmath49 equal to the coronal scale height ( @xmath68 ) so that @xmath69 corresponds to one coronal scale height .",
    "having set these values , we are left with two free parameters : the driving frequency ( @xmath70 ) and the wavenumber in the @xmath5-direction , @xmath71 . by altering these parameters we can make comparisons between our results and different analytical models .",
    "as we wish to investigate wave propagation across the @xmath1 layer we shall describe the properties of waves above and below this region .",
    "an uncoupled slow magnetoacoustic wave ( @xmath72 limit ) propagating through a low-@xmath0 plasma will change its behaviour to that of a fast magnetoacoustic wave as it passes into high-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "similarly an uncoupled fast wave will change its behaviour to that of a slow wave as it travels from low to high-@xmath0 plasma . despite this change in behaviour ,",
    "the wave mode is the same , no conversion has occurred .",
    "thus , when we discuss mode conversion , the slow wave driven on the upper boundary retains the properties of a slow wave as it propagates down into the high-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "we do not see any evidence of upward - propagating fast waves from the mode - conversion region .",
    "the transmitted part of the incident slow wave will continue into the high-@xmath0 plasma as a fast wave .",
    ", @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 layer is denoted by a dashed line . ]",
    "this is demonstrated by the numerical simulations seen in figure  [ trans.fig ] , which shows our variables under the transformations @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "these transformations remove the exponential behaviour , which is due to gravity , from the plots making other effects much clearer .",
    "the wave driven in on the upper boundary is , as discussed , predominantly a slow wave and this behaviour is retained until the wave reaches the @xmath75 layer . at this point ,",
    "mode conversion occurs , and in the high-@xmath0 plasma ( to the left of the dashed line ) the converted part of the wave propagates as a slow wave and the transmitted part as a fast wave .",
    "the plots of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in figure  [ trans.fig ] clearly show the fast wave out in front at @xmath85 , the interference seen for @xmath86 is due to the interaction of the fast and slow waves .",
    "the plots for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 illustrate that the interference stops at @xmath90 because this is as far as the slow wave has propagated .",
    "gravity does not seem to affect the position of the mode conversion layer , which was also found to lie at @xmath75 in a weakly non - uniform medium .    ) for @xmath91 and @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 layer is denoted by a dashed line . ]",
    "we now consider the effect of varying the wavenumber , @xmath71 , on the mode conversion .",
    "figure  [ varyk2pi.fig ] shows the transformed vertical velocity , @xmath82 , at @xmath91 for a range of values for @xmath71 .",
    "the driving frequency , @xmath74 , corresponds to driving in a wave with a period of one alfvn time , or @xmath92s .",
    "it is clear from the wave equations  ( [ wav.eqns ] ) that when @xmath72 the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are completely decoupled .",
    "this can be observed in figure  [ varyk2pi.fig ] where no mode conversion is seen for @xmath72 , and indeed is not even visible for very small @xmath71 .",
    "as @xmath71 increases further the amount of mode conversion also increases , until almost none of the incident wave can be seen beyond the @xmath75 layer for @xmath93 . in section  [ smallk.sec ]",
    "we quantify the proportion of mode conversion using an approximation valid for small @xmath71 , and in section  [ largek.sec ] we investigate behaviour for large @xmath71 .",
    "cairns and lashmore - davies ( 1983 , 1986 ) and cairns and fuchs ( 1989 ) developed a method of solving mode - conversion problems , which derives differential equations describing the coupled mode amplitudes from the local dispersion relation .",
    "these equations can then be solved analytically to find the transmission and conversion coefficients . in relation to our simulations",
    "this method can be applied when @xmath71 is small , and @xmath70 is sufficiently large compared to @xmath71 .    starting with equations  ( [ wav.eqns ] ) we take the time variation as @xmath94 so that @xmath95 and let @xmath96 . under the assumption that @xmath71 is small and @xmath70 large , the derivatives of @xmath97 and @xmath63 with respect to @xmath25 are larger than the functions themselves .",
    "thus , our equations may be reduced to @xmath98 the equation for @xmath63 is driven by the @xmath97 that is imposed at the upper boundary .",
    "this inhomogeneous term has a wavenumber in @xmath25 given by @xmath99 and at @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , there is a resonance and the amplitude of @xmath63 increases rapidly while the amplitude of @xmath97 is reduced .",
    "this is mode conversion .    expanding @xmath102 around the mode conversion region ( _ i.e .",
    "_ for the downward propagating waves described by the brackets containing minus signs ) and letting @xmath103 away from this region , our equations may be written @xmath104 these satisfy the condition for energy conservation @xmath105 eliminating @xmath63 from equations  ( [ cairns.eqn ] ) and making the transformations given by cairns and lashmore - davies @xmath106 we obtain @xmath107 the solution of this equation is given by the parabolic cylinder function @xmath108 where @xmath109 the asymptotic behaviour of these functions is described in detail in abramowitz and stegun ( 1964 ) .    .",
    "the solid line gives the values predicted using equation  ( [ amp.eqn ] ) and the stars are values calculated from numerical simulations run for @xmath110 . ]",
    "equations  ( [ cairns.eqn ] ) may also be compared directly to the expressions used in cairns and lashmore - davies ( 1983 ) to find the energy transmission and so the ratio of wave amplitudes in high and low-@xmath0 is given by @xmath111 thus , if we know the amplitude of the incident slow wave , we may multiply by @xmath112 to predict the amplitude of the transmitted fast wave .",
    "a comparison between this analytical approximation and our numerical data is shown in figure  [ logamp.fig ] .",
    "the logarithm has been taken to highlight that the data is in excellent agreement for small @xmath71 ; no visible difference could be seen between the analytical prediction  ( [ amp.eqn ] ) and the original numerical data .",
    "cally ( 2006 ) and schunker and cally ( 2006 ) apply ray tracing theory to the mode conversion problem .",
    "they also find these transmission coefficients .      for large @xmath71 we may compare our numerical simulations with an analytical approximation derived by roberts ( 2006 ) . in the limit of large @xmath71 the first of our wave equations  ( [ wav.eqns ] ) reduces to @xmath113",
    "we may use this to eliminate @xmath63 from the first wave equation giving @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the tube speed .",
    "if we introduce @xmath116 then our equation can be written in the form of the klein - gordon equation @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a cut - off frequency .    using the klein - gordon equation  ( [ klein.eqn ] ) with",
    "the term involving the cut - off frequency neglected , and the formal wkb method , as described in bender and orszag ( 1978 ) , we find a solution of @xmath119 , valid for @xmath70 large , to leading order @xmath120\\right\\}\\\\&=&dc_t^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(z\\right)\\sin \\left\\{\\omega\\left[t+\\frac{1}{c_s}\\ln\\left|\\frac{\\left(c_t\\left(z\\right)+c_s\\right)\\left(c_t\\left(z_{m}\\right)-c_s\\right)}{\\left(c_t\\left(z\\right)-c_s\\right)\\left(c_t\\left(z_{m}\\right)+c_s\\right)}\\right|\\right.\\right.\\\\&&\\left.\\left.-2\\left(\\frac{1}{c_t\\left(z\\right)}-\\frac{1}{c_t\\left(z_{m}\\right)}\\right)\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is a constant and @xmath122 is the maximum value of @xmath25 .",

    "this expression agrees extremely well with the data obtained from the numerical simulations , as can be seen in figure  [ ampvz.fig ] .",
    "an analytical approximation to @xmath63 can then be calculated using equation  ( [ vxapprox.eqn ] ) ; a comparison of this result with the numerical data is shown in figure  [ ampvx.fig ] .",
    "the agreement between the numerical simulations and the analytical approximation is clearly not as good for @xmath63 ( figure  [ ampvx.fig ] ) as it is for @xmath61 ( figure  [ ampvz.fig ] ) . if we remove the exponential behaviour from the vertical velocity , as is shown in figure  [ transampvz.fig ]",
    ", we can see that for @xmath126 the agreement between the analytical and numerical results worsens .",
    "this is the same area for which we begin to see a deviation between the two solutions for the horizontal velocity . in order to improve agreement",
    "a higher - order wkb solution should be found .",
    "in this paper we have considered the downward propagation of linear waves in an isothermal atmosphere permeated by a vertical background magnetic field .",
    "more specifically , we concentrated on the region where the wave passes from low-@xmath0 to high-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "as expected our simulations show mode conversion occurring as the wave passes through this region at the point where the sound and alfvn speeds are equal ( figure  [ trans.fig ] ) , similar to a weakly non - uniform medium .",
    "one of the free parameters in our simulations is the horizontal wavenumber ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "figure  [ varyk2pi.fig ] shows that the value of @xmath71 has a strong effect on the amount of mode conversion that occurs . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the two wave modes are completely decoupled and no mode conversion occurs , and as @xmath71 increases so does the degree of mode conversion . as the wavenumber was shown to be an important factor , we then looked at analytical approximations in the limit of both small and large @xmath71 .    for small @xmath71 we applied the method developed by cairns and lashmore - davies ( 1983 ) for analysing mode conversion .",
    "this allowed us to find a solution for the vertical velocity ( @xmath61 ) which is valid in the mode - conversion region .",
    "this solution is related to the parabolic cylinder function , for which asymptotic solutions are readily available @xcite .",
    "we also found the amplitude of the transmitted wave , predicted from the amplitude of the incident wave , is in excellent agreement with our numerical data ( figure  [ logamp.fig ] ) .",
    "this equation backs up our observation that the mode conversion increases with @xmath71 and reveals that @xmath70 also has an effect on mode conversion , namely mode conversion decreases as @xmath70 increases .",
    "however , the effect due to the wavenumber @xmath71 is the stronger of the two .    for large @xmath71 we followed an analysis carried out by roberts ( 2006 ) .",
    "from this we found a wkb solution for @xmath61 valid for large @xmath70 ( equation  ( [ analvz.eqn ] ) ) .",
    "this in turn was used to find an analytical solution for @xmath63 using equation  ( [ vxapprox.eqn ] ) .",
    "figure  [ ampvz.fig ] shows very good agreement between the analytical and numerical results for the vertical velocity , however once the exponential behaviour is removed ( figure  [ transampvz.fig ] ) we see that the analytical solution begins to deviate from the numerical results for @xmath126 .",
    "this is also true of the horizontal velocity ( @xmath63 ) shown in figure  [ ampvx.fig ] .",
    "equation  ( [ vxapprox.eqn ] ) linking @xmath63 to @xmath61 itself is a very good approximation provided @xmath71 is large .    a thorough investigation of this very simple one - dimensional model has yielded some very interesting results , giving us some insight into the mode conversion problem .",
    "we hope to extend this work to include a non - isothermal atmosphere , making the model more physically realistic ."
