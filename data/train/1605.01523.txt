    "the extra - galactic background light , or ebl ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) , represents the flux received today from a steradian of extragalactic sky .",
    "it includes all far - uv to far - ir sources of photon production since the era of recombination , and thereby encodes a record of the entire energy production history of the universe from @xmath7380,000yrs after the big bang to the present day  see @xcite and @xcite for an interesting digression regarding the ebl s relation to olber s paradox . by convention , the ebl is defined as the radiation received between 0.1@xmath0 m to 1000@xmath0 m ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this arises predominantly from star - light , agn - light , and dust reprocessed light  with some minimal ( @xmath8 ) contribution from direct dust heating due to accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photon production occurs not only at far - uv to far - ir wavelengths , but across the entire electro - magnetic spectrum ( e.g. , the cosmic x - ray background , see @xcite ; and the cosmic radio background , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , based on integrated energy considerations ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , the cosmic emission is dominated , in terms of newly minted photons , by the far - uv to far - ir range .",
    "compared to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) the integrated - ebl is smaller by a factor of @xmath10 , despite the @xmath11 diminution of the cmb photon energies , but more than a factor of @xmath12 brighter than the other backgrounds . putting aside the cmb and the pre - recombination universe , the ebl is a product of the dominant astrophysical processes which have taken place over the past 13  billion years , in terms of energy redistribution ( baryonic mass @xmath13 photons ) . in particular , because of the expansion , the precise shape of the spectral energy distribution of the ebl depends on the cosmic star - formation history , agn activity history , and the evolution of dust properties over cosmic time .",
    "it therefore represents rich territory for comparison to galaxy formation and evolution models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ebl can be broken down into two roughly equal contributions from the uv - optical - near - ir and the mid- to far- ir wavelength ranges : the cosmic optical background ( cob ; 0.1@xmath0 m  8@xmath0 m ) and the cosmic infrared background ( cib @xmath14 m  1000@xmath0 m ; @xcite ) . despite the different wavelength ranges ,",
    "the cob and cib ultimately derive from the same origin : star - formation and gravitational accretion onto super - massive black holes .",
    "the cob represents the star- and agn-",
    "light which directly escapes the host system , and obsequiously pervades into the inter - galactic medium .",
    "the cib represents that component which is first attenuated by dust near the radiation sources , and subsequently re - radiated in the mid- and far - ir .",
    "the near equal balance between the energy of the integrated cob and cib is very much a testimony to the severe impact of dust attenuating predominantly uv and optical photons , particularly given the very modest amount of baryonic mass in the form of dust ( @xmath15% relative to stellar mass , see for example @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "previous measurements of the ebl have come two flavours : direct measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and integrated galaxy - counts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these two methods should converge if the ebl is predominantly derived from galaxies ( including any agn component ) , and if the photometric data used to detect these galaxies are sufficiently deep .    until fairly recently , insufficient deep data existed to completely resolve the ebl using galaxy number - counts , and direct measurements appeared the more compelling constraint .",
    "however , with the advent of space - based facilities ( _ galex _ , _ hst _ , _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ ) , and large ground - based facilities ( vlt , subaru ) , deep field data have now been obtained across the entire far - uv to far - ir range .",
    "the comparison of the direct estimates and integrated number - counts are proving fertile ground for debate . in the cib , the direct estimates agree reasonably well with the integrated source counts , which account for over 75% of the directly measured cib ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining discrepancy can be readily reconciled from extrapolations of the source counts , plus some additional contribution from lensed systems ( @xcite ) . in the optical and near - ir the situation is less clear , with many direct estimates being a factor of five or more greater than the integrated galaxy counts",
    "( see for example the discussion on the near - ir background excess in @xcite or @xcite ) , despite the advent of very wide and deep data .",
    "either the integrated source counts are missing a significant quantity of the ebl in a diffuse component , or the direct measures are over - estimated ( i.e. , the backgrounds are under - estimated ) .",
    "recently a third pathway to the ebl has opened up , via the indirect attenuation of tev photons emanating from blazars , as observed with very high energy ( vhe ) experiments ( e.g. , the high energy stereoscopic system , h.e.s.s .",
    ", and the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov telescope , magic ) . here the tev flux from a distant blazar , believed to extrude a well behaved power - law spectrum , interacts with the intervening ebl photon - field .",
    "preferential interactions between tev and micron photons create electron - positron pairs , thereby removing power from the received tev spectrum over a characteristic wavelength range .",
    "the proof of concept was demonstrated by @xcite and comprehensive measurements have recently been made by both the h.e.s.s .",
    "consortium ( @xcite ) and the magic team ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two independent measurements very much favour the low - ebl values .",
    "however , uncertainty remains as to the strength , and hence , impact of the inter - galactic magnetic field , the intrinsic blazar spectrum shape , and the role of secondary pev cascades .",
    "moreover , the two vhe studies mentioned above require a pre - defined ebl model , and use the shape of the received tev signal compared to the assumed intrinsic spectrum , to provide a normalisation point .",
    "hence spectral information is essentially lost .",
    "trickier to determine but more powerful is the potential for the vhe data to constrain both the normalisation _ and _ the shape of the ebl spectrum .",
    "a first effort was recently made by @xcite who again found results consistent with the low - ebl value , but perhaps more crucially provided independent confirmation of the overall shape across the far - uv to far - ir wavelength range .",
    "nevertheless , caveats remain as to the true intrinsic blazar spectral slope in the tev range , contaminating cascades from pev photons , the strength of any intervening magnetic fields , and in some cases the actual redshift of the blazars studied .    here",
    "we aim to provide the first complete set of integrated - galaxy light measurements based on a combination of panchromatic wide and deep number / source - count data from a variety of surveys which collectively span the entire ebl wavelength range ( 0.1@xmath0 m  1000@xmath0 m ) .",
    "our approach varies from previous studies , in that we abandon the concept of modeling the data with a galaxy - count ( backward propagation ) model . instead , as the number - count data is bounded in all bands",
    " in terms of the contribution to the integrated luminosity density  we elect to fit a simple spline to the luminosity density data .",
    "in section  2 , we present the adopted number - count data , the trimming required before fitting , and estimates of the cosmic ( sample ) variance associated with each dataset . in section  3 , we describe our fitting process and the associated error analysis .",
    "we compare our measurements to previous estimates in section 4 , including direct and vhe constraints , before exploring possible sources of missing light .",
    "we finish by using the ebl model of driver & andrews ( see @xcite and @xcite ) as an appropriate fitting function to derive the total integrated energy of the cob and cib .",
    "all magnitudes are reported in the ab system , and where relevant we have used a cosmology with @xmath16 , and , @xmath17km / s / mpc .",
    "this work has been motivated by the recent availability of a number of panchromatic data sets which extend from the far - uv to the far - ir . in particular :",
    "galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; cosmos / g10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; _ hubble space telescope _ early release science ( ers ; @xcite ) ; and the _ hubble space telescope _ ultra - violet ultra - deep field ( uvudf ; @xcite , @xcite ) . for each of these datasets great care has been taken to produce consistent and high quality photometry across a broad wavelength range .",
    "we have been responsible for the production of the first three catalogues , with the fourth recently made publicly available .",
    "we describe the various datasets in more detail below .",
    "gama represents a survey of five sky regions covering 230  @xmath18 @xcite , with spectroscopic data to @xmath19mag obtained from the anglo - australian telescope @xcite .",
    "complementary panchromatic imaging data comes from observations via _ galex _",
    "@xcite , sdss @xcite , vista @xcite , _ wise _ @xcite , and _ herschel _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the gama panchromatic data release imaging @xcite was made publicly available in august 2015 ( http://gama-psi.icrar.org ) . the 180  @xmath20 which makes up the three gama equatorial regions ( g09 , g12 & g15 ) ,",
    "has since been processed with the custom built panchromatic analysis code lambdar @xcite , to derive matched - aperture and psf - convolved photometry across all bands .",
    "the wright - catalogue is @xmath21-band selected using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the sextractor - defined apertures are convolved with the appropriate point - spread function for each facility , and used to derive consistent flux measurements in all other bands .",
    "care is taken to manage overlapping objects and flux share appropriately ( see @xcite for full details ) .",
    "as part of the quality control process , all bright and all oversized apertures ( for their magnitude ) , were visually inspected and corrected if necessary .",
    "the wright - catalogue then uses these apertures to provide fluxes in the following bands : fuv / nuv , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24-@xmath25 , pacs  100/160 , spire  250/350/500 .",
    "number - counts are generated by binning the data within 0.5mag intervals and scaling for the area covered .",
    "random errors are derived assuming poisson statistics ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) with cosmic variance errors included in the analysis as described in sections 2.5 and 3.3.4 .",
    "note that in generating number counts , the @xmath21-band selection will lead to a gradual flattening of the counts in other bands , particularly those bands furthest in wavelength from @xmath21 , i.e. , a colour bias .",
    "the very simple strategy we adopt here is to identify the point at which the gama wright - catalogue counts diverge from the deeper datasets and truncate our counts 0.5  mag brightwards of this limit .",
    "see @xcite for full details of the gama analysis including aperture verification .",
    "cosmos / g10 represents a complete reanalysis of the available spectroscopic and imaging data to gama standards , in a 1  sq .",
    "degree region of the _ hst _ cosmos field @xcite , dubbed g10 ( gama @xmath27 ; see @xcite , @xcite for full details ) .",
    "the primary source detection catalogue uses sextractor applied to deep subaru @xmath28-band data , following trial and error optimisation of the sextractor detection parameters .",
    "all anomalous apertures were manually inspected and repaired , as needed . as for gama ,",
    "the lambdar software was used to generate matched aperture photometry from the far - uv to far - ir .",
    "the photometry for the cosmos / g10 region spans 38 wavebands , and combines data from _ galex _",

    "( @xcite and @xcite ) and _ herschel _ ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as for gama the number - counts are derived in 0.5mag bins yielding counts in : fuv / nuv , u , griz , yjhk , @xmath29 , mips  24/70 , pacs  100/160 , spire  250/350/500 .",
    "the cosmos / g10 catalogue is @xmath28-band selected , and hence a gradual decline in the number counts will occur in filters other than @xmath28 , as either very red or blue galaxies are preferentially lost . in particular ,",
    "a cascading flux cut was implemented as the optical priors were advanced into the far - ir to minimise erroneous measurements . as for gama",
    "we use the departure of the cosmos / g10 counts from the available deeper data to identify the magnitude limits at which the counts become incomplete . see @xcite for full details of the cosmos / g10 analysis including data access .",
    "the _ hst _ ers dataset @xcite represents one of the first fields obtained using _ hst _",
    "s wfc3 , and built upon earlier optical acs imaging of the goods south field .",
    "the analysis details are provided in windhorst et al ( 2011 ) , and counts are derived in 11 bands : f225w , f275w , f306w , f435w , f775w , f850lp , f098 m , f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w covering 40 - 50 arcmin@xmath30 to ab @xmath31@xmath32  mag . for the _ hst _",
    "ers , data catalogues were derived independently in each band , hence avoiding any color bias .",
    "_ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ data exists for the _ hst _ ers field , but is currently not part of this analysis due to its much coarser beam and the resulting faint - end confusion .",
    "in due course , we expect to reprocess the ers data using lambdar .",
    "in addition to the _ hst _ ers field the asu team have also measured deep counts in various bands in the udf and xdf fields using an identical process as that described for the _ hst _ ers data , but including a correction for incompleteness by inserting false galaxy images into real data and assessing the fraction recovered as a function of magnitude .",
    "see @xcite for full details of the _ hst _ ers and deep field analysis .",
    "the _ hst _ uvudf dataset ( @xcite ) represents a major effort to bring together data on the hudf field spanning a broad wavelength range and consisting of 11 bands from the near - uv to the near - ir ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the uvudf team also use an aperture matched point - spread function corrected method to derive the photometry .",
    "the area of coverage varies from 7.3 to 12.8 arcmin@xmath30 across the bands .",
    "the initial detection image is derived from the combination of 4 optical and 4 near - ir bands ( weighted by the inverse variance of each image on a pixel - by - pixel basis ) .",
    "as the near - ir data is variable in depth , this does produce a catalogue with a slightly variable detection wavelength .",
    "however , the basic strategy of object detection based on multi - filter stacked data combined with pixel weighting , should mitigate most of the color selection bias in the count data . the rafelski et al .",
    "catalogue is publicly available and counts are derived by binning the data in 0.5mag intervals and scaling for area .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "uvudf dataset contains counts in the following bands : f225w , f275w , f336w , f435w , f606w , f775w , f850lp , f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w .",
    "see @xcite for full details of the uvudf data analysis .",
    "in addition to the four primary catalogues mentioned above , we include a number of band specific surveys to extend the range of our number count analysis into the far - uv , mid - ir and far - ir .",
    "these datasets , along with the four primary datasets , are summarised in table  [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "all datasets will be susceptible to cosmic variance particularly at the fainter ends of the _ hst _ datasets , where the volumes probed will be very small . for each dataset",
    "we therefore derive a cosmic ( sample ) variance error ; listed in col .",
    "5 of table  [ tab : datasets ] using equation 4 from @xcite .",
    "these values are based on the quoted field - of - view , the number of independent fields , and an assumed redshift distribution and the adopted values are also shown in table .",
    "[ tab : datasets ] .",
    "we refer the curious reader to our online calculator : http://cosmocalc.icrar.org ( see survey design tab ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^ , > , < \" , ]     notes : table  [ tab : counts ] is published in its entirety in a machine readable format .",
    "a portion is shown here for guidance regarding its form and content .",
    "table  [ tab : counts ] provides an extract of our trimmed data listing our compiled number counts and associated errors , as used for our spline fitting for each wave - band .",
    "this data file in machine readable format from the apj online edition .",
    "there are a number of possible sources of error ; in particular we consider those arriving from a systematic photometry error ( zero - point shift , or background over / under estimation ) , the fitting process , those implied from the errors in the count data , and the possible impact of cosmic variance .",
    "we explore each of these in turn .      in most cases where we have multiple datasets",
    "we see that the counts agree within 0.05  mag , despite the potential for filter offsets due to small bandpass discrepancies .",
    "generally , errors in absolute zero - points , particularly in _ hst _ data are expected to be @xmath33@xmath34  mag .",
    "however the process of sky - subtraction , object detection , and photometric measurement can lead to significant _ systematic _ variations . the easiest way to quantify",
    "the impact is to _ systematically _ shift all datasets by @xmath35  mag and re - derive our measurements .",
    "the value of @xmath35  mag comes from the amount required to align the various deep datasets , and is taken here to represent the systematic uncertainty in the entire photometric extraction process .",
    "this level of uncertainty should be considered conservative  surveys such as gama , for example typically quote errors of @xmath36 in photometric measurements  but high-@xmath37 galaxies are often asymmetric , and their photometry distorted by ambiguous deblends .",
    "hence , a larger assumed error of @xmath35 mag seems plausible and prudent .",
    "6 of table  [ tab : ebl ] shows the perturbation to the best - fit value if all data - points are systematically shifted by @xmath35 mag . only for mips",
    "@xmath38 m does this error dominate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] , green line ) .",
    "the fitting process we adopt arbitrarily uses a 10-point spline - fit .",
    "this was judged to be the lowest number of spline points required to represent the data well .",
    "we repeat our analysis using an 8 or 12 point spline - fit and report the impact ( col .",
    "7 ) on our best - fit value using these alternative representations , i.e. , @xmath39 . in all cases except for @xmath24-@xmath40 , where other issues have already been raised , the variation due to the fitting process is negligible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] , red line ) .      to assess the error arising from the uncertainty in the individual data - points , we conduct 10,001 monte - carlo realizations where we randomly perturb each data - point by its permissible error , assuming the errors follow a normal distribution . for each sequence of perturbations we re - fit the spline and extract the 16@xmath41percentile and the 84@xmath41 percentile values for the luminosity density .",
    "the uncertainty given in col .  7 of table  [ tab : ebl ] is then @xmath42 .",
    "we see that this error becomes dominant for data longwards of mips @xmath38 m ( fig .  [ fig : errors ] , blue line ) .",
    "finally we assess the error introduced by cosmic variance ( or sample variance ) , as discussed by @xcite . for each dataset shown in table .",
    "[ tab : datasets ] , we derive and assign a cosmic variance estimate based on equation 4 in @xcite , using the appropriate areas of the various datasets and some assumption of the likely redshift range contributing to the counts ( see table .  [ tab : datasets ] ) .",
    "we conduct 10,001 monte - carlo realizations , where we perturb each dataset by a random amount defined by its cosmic variance ( assuming the cv offset can be drawn from a normal distribution ) .",
    "we extract the 16@xmath41percentile and the 84@xmath41 percentiles , from which we derive an uncertainty , as , @xmath43 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] ( orange line ) that this error dominates for most of the uv , optical , near - ir , and mid - ir bands .      combining random and systematic errors",
    "is not entirely straightforward , with some proponents advocating simply adding them while others adding in quadrature , or keeping the systematic and random errors separate .",
    "here we take the most conservative approach of adding the errors linearly , but provide the individual errors in table  [ tab : ebl ] for those wishing to combine them in other ways .",
    "the data points shown on subsequent figures are calculated according to @xmath44    fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] shows the contribution of each of the individual errors to our eigl measurements and highlights the transition from being dominated by cosmic variance error at shorter wavelengths to random errors at longer wavelengths . at one wavelength ( @xmath24-@xmath40 )",
    ", we note that the fitting error itself dominates because of the complex shape of the data .",
    "one clear consequence from fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] is that deep , wide data are essential to reduce this error component , which should be readily achievable in the optical and near - ir , with the upcoming _ euclid _ and the _ wide field infrared space telescope ( wfirst ) _ space - missions . assuming calibration errors can be minimised , there is the distinct possibility of obtaining eigl measurements to better than 1% over the next decade .      fig .",
    "[ fig : eblall ] shows various igl and ebl measurements as reported over the past few years .",
    "most of the data comes from the comprehensive compilation by @xcite ( see their tables 3 , 4 & 5 for detailed references , although most appear here in the introduction and text ) , plus more recent measurements by @xcite .",
    "we colour code the data into three sets following dwek & krennrich : lower limits on the igl ( grey ) , igl measurements based on various extrapolated number counts ( orange ) ; and direct measurements of the ebl via various methods ( blue ) .",
    "our new data is shown in red and appears consistent with most previous eigl measurements . within the eigl data we only see one major discrepancy which is with the @xcite value in the @xmath24-@xmath45 band .",
    "we find a significantly ( @xmath46 ) lower value .",
    "@xcite also combine galaxy count data from a number of sources and use two methods for deriving photometry , profile fitting and apertures .",
    "both require significant corrections ( upward shifts of @xmath47% ) .",
    "the value reported is from profile fitting , however , we note that their corrected aperture value is significantly lower ( @xmath48 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 ) , and consistent with our measurement ( @xmath49 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 ) .",
    "we argue that , as our 3.6@xmath0 m measurement lies in between our @xmath50 m and @xmath51 m measurements , it is likely that the @xcite profile - fit value is biased high .    in the far - uv and near - uv , we recover higher measurements than those reported by @xcite , although formally at the @xmath52 error - limits .",
    "however , this is nonetheless consistent with the data shown in @xcite ( see their figure  1 ) where their number counts in both the far - uv and near - uv , to which their model is fitted , do appear to fall systematically below the comparison datasets .",
    "see also figure  6 of @xcite which shows an offset between the data of @xcite and @xcite . table .  2 of @xcite reports eigl measurements by @xcite and @xcite as well as @xcite and earlier studies .",
    "our value agrees well  lies between  the two estimates provided by @xcite . in the near - uv",
    "our result is dependent on an entirely different dataset , namely f225w observations of the uvudf .",
    "this base data is very different to the hst acs sbc data of @xcite , and agrees closely to the much earlier hst stis data of @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the uv excess seen in our data against the model is supported by three distinct datasets and therefore likely real and significant .    in the far - ir",
    ", we see that our measurements mostly agree with those previously reported .",
    "the one obvious outlier is the pacs 160@xmath0 m data , however we note ( see table  [ tab : ebl ] ) that a significant amount of flux is coming from the extrapolation .",
    "in particular the deepest data points from @xcite do include significant completeness corrections .",
    "if we re - fit using only data with completeness corrections at @xmath53% ( their filled data points on their figure  6 ) , we recover a much more consistent value ( see the second entry in table  [ tab : ebl ] and orange data point on fig .  [",
    "fig : eblall ] ) .",
    "we therefore elect to adopt this revised data point as the more robust estimate .",
    "most apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : eblall ] is the discrepancy in the optical to near - ir between all the eigl data ( including our own ) , and the direct measurements .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the far - ir where the eigl and ebl measurements agree within the specific errors . in the case of the far - ir ,",
    "the agreement is reassuring , and the much smaller error bars on the eigl measurements suggest that the eigl route is the more robust .",
    "why then do we see such a discrepancy in the optical ?",
    "the model curve ( black ) shows the energy evolution model reported in @xcite , which agrees closely with the eigl data .",
    "both the model and the general consensus in the far - ir would therefore suggest that the error may lie in the direct measurements , some of which do concur with the eigl estimates .",
    "it is worth noting that direct measurements rely on a robust subtraction of the foreground light of which there are two dominant sources : the milky way stellar population and zodiacal light ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . that the discrepancy is most apparent at a wavelength comparable to the peak in the solar spectrum",
    "also suggests that one or both of these foregrounds is the source of the problem , and that either the milky way model or the zodiacal model have been underestimated .",
    "one indication for the latter over the former is the reanalysis of data taken between 19721974 at 0.44@xmath0 m and 0.65@xmath0 m by the _ pioneer  10/11 _ spacecraft @xcite . during that period",
    "the spacecraft were approximately 4.66au away from the sun where the zodiacal light contribution should be negligible .",
    "matsuoka found significantly lower ebl measurements that are in agreement with our eigl values .",
    "we advocate that given this information , it might be useful to adopt the eigl as the _ de facto _ measurements of the ebl , and use these to help improve the zodiacal light and inner solar system dust model .",
    "[ fig : vhe ] shows the comparison of our eigl data to three vhe datasets ( as indicated ) .",
    "the agreement is much better than with the direct estimates , and provides additional independent evidence that the direct estimates may be in error .",
    "note that the h.e.s.s . and magic datasets each adopt a pre - defined ebl model and",
    "solve for the normalisation , hence the slight shape discrepancy between the vhe and eigl data is of no significance .",
    "formally , the datasets overlap within the 1@xmath54 errors , although the error range of the vhe data is fairly broad ( @xmath55 ) . as discussed in the introduction , the vhe data also comes with some caveats , in particular the assumption of the intrinsic shape of the blazar spectra(um ) , the possibility of other interactions , e.g. , with the intergalactic magnetic field or with pev cascades .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement is extremely encouraging and taken at face value suggests that our eigl measurements are close to the underlying ebl values .      before equating our eigl measurement to the ebl we should first acknowledge , in particular , the possible contributions from the low surface brightness universe : that from intra - cluster and intra - group light @xcite , also referred to as intra - halo light or ihl @xcite ; and that from the epoch of reionisation @xcite .",
    "the space - density of low surface brightness galaxies is currently poorly constrained , however observations in the local group suggest that the luminosity density is very much dominated by the milky way and andromeda . this picture is generally supported by our own estimates of the low surface brightness population from the _ hst _ hdf @xcite and the millennium galaxy catalogue ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both studies explored the low surface brightness universe and , while finding numerous new systems , they ultimately contribute only small amounts of additional light ( @xmath53% ; @xcite ) .",
    "studies of rich clusters have also been very successful at finding low surface brightness systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , yet not in sufficient quantities to significantly affect the total luminosity density , e.g. , the thousand new galaxies found in the coma cluster by @xcite collectively add up to just one extra l@xmath56 galaxy .",
    "two final arguments can be made for a minimal amount of missing light from low surface brightness galaxies based on the number - count and igl data itself .",
    "firstly , as each survey would have distinct surface brightness cutoffs , any large population would be truncated at different surface brightness levels leading to stark mismatches between the distinct surveys .",
    "that the surveys overlap so well is a strong argument for any missing population being relatively modest in terms of their luminosity density .",
    "secondly , any missing population of galaxies will contain both optical emission from the starlight , and dust emission from reprocessed starlight .",
    "hence the consistency between the far - ir ebl and eigl can provide a constraint . to assess this we compare our values of the eigl to the direct ebl measurements of @xcite , and derive ( eigl / ebl ) ratios of 0.96 , 0.97 , 1.05 and 1.03 in 160 ,",
    "250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m bands for an average of 1.01 , i.e. , on average 100% of the direct ebl is `` resolved '' by our eigl measurements .",
    "this therefore only gives no room for an upward adjustment for missing `` dusty '' galaxies .",
    "however we do acknowledge that the errors in both our data and the fixsen data are significant ( typically 40% per band ) , and hence this close agreement must be somewhat coincidental . folding in the errors there is potentially room for an @xmath57 upward adjustment , i.e. , @xmath58 , before our eigl exceeds the fixsen ebl measurements by their reported 1@xmath54 errors .",
    "of course this argument assumes that the dust properties of low surface brightness galaxies are consistent with those of normal spiral galaxies , which may not be the case .",
    "a similar conclusion , with regards missing galaxy light , was also reached by @xcite , who specifically explored the potential impact of surface brightness selection in deep subaru number counts , and concluded that any impact from missing low surface brightness galaxies , via number - count modeling , was @xmath53% in the @xmath59 bands .",
    "our range of 20% is comparable and hence we can adopt a possible 020% upward adjustment range for missing low surface brightness galaxies .      the case for the intra - cluster light",
    "is slightly less clear - cut .",
    "@xcite shows spectacular images of nearby systems , including virgo , which typically contain between 10 - 20% of the light in a diffuse component . in the frontiers cluster a2744 ,",
    "@xcite find that the icl makes up only 6% of the stellar mass .",
    "similarly , the study by @xcite also finds a relatively modest amount of mass ( 8% ) in the clash - vlt cluster macs j1206.2 - 0847 .",
    "earlier studies of coma , perhaps the most studied system , found significantly more diffuse light , extending up to almost 50% @xcite , and simulations by @xcite suggest the icl might contain anywhere from 10 - 40% of a rich cluster s",
    "total luminosity .",
    "hence , studies of the icl could be used to argue for an upward adjustment of the optical - only light of between 10 - 50% .",
    "however it is important to remember that rich clusters , such as coma , the frontier s , and clash clusters are exceedingly rare @xcite , with less than 2% of the integrated galaxy light coming from @xmath60m@xmath61 haloes ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the absence of quality data ,",
    "intuition can lead one in both directions , as the fraction of diffuse light is likely to be a function of the halo velocity dispersion , and the galaxy - galaxy interaction velocity , duration , and frequency .",
    "certainly evidence from the local group suggests a fairly modest contribution , with the magellanic stream representing the only significant known source of diffuse light .",
    "furthermore the deep study of m96 ( leo i group ) by @xcite , failed to identify any significant intra - group light to limits of 30.1 mag / sq arcsec .",
    "intra - halo light will only affect the optical bands as it is dust free due to the uv flux pervading the icm destroying any dust particles .",
    "we can therefore gauge the possible level by comparing our eigl @xmath62 band measurement to the ebl . as mentioned earlier , because of uncertainties in the zodiacal light model we can not use most of the direct estimates , however we can use the values provided by @xcite obtained from _",
    "pioneer  10/11_. using these we find eigl / ebl ratios of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the @xmath62 and @xmath21 bands respectively ( with the errors dominated by the uncertainty in the _ pioneer _ estimates ) .",
    "the errors are large but suggest that the contribution from the ihl ( which can only be positive ) lies in the range 3 - 32% but with a possible extreme upper limit of @xmath735% ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) upward correction of the optical and near - ir data ( in - line with our earlier discussion of the icl ) .",
    "reionisation could potentially provide an additional diffuse photon field in the near - ir range , i.e. , where ly@xmath66 is redshifted longwards of @xmath67 m .",
    "recent modeling by @xcite suggests the flux of reionisation today might be in the range 0.1 - 0.3 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at @xmath68 m , i.e. a 3% effect .",
    "this is well below our quoted errors and so reionisation is unlikely to significantly impact upon our measurements .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the reionisation models are uncertain , and a more rigid upper - limit of @xmath69 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at @xmath67 m was set by @xcite , based on arguments which related to the production of excessive metals if the reionising flux was any stronger .",
    "this latter level is plausibly detectable and could cause our eigl to underestimate the ebl by @xmath10% in the near - ir .",
    "hence comparison of the near - ir eigl to direct ebl measurements could conceivably detect the reionisation field .",
    "the eigl and the ebl are , from the discussion above , slightly different entities where the eigl represents the sum of all radiation from bound galaxies while the ebl includes , in addition , diffuse light from the ihl and the epoch of reionisation .",
    "however we have estimated in comparison to the available direct ebl estimates that the eigl should match the ebl to within 035% in uv - optical - near - ir bandpasses and 020% in far - ir bandpasses .",
    "these numbers are also consistent with the discrepancy between our eigl measurements and the indirect vhe measurements . specifically in @xmath70 band",
    "we find an eigl value of @xmath71 while the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration find a range for the ebl of 18.5-11.5 and the magic team a range of 14.89.8 .",
    "formally our values are consistent .",
    "again the means our value is low by 45% and 18% but with no ( @xmath72 significance ) .",
    "the take home message is more that the eigl and vhe ebl data show promising consistency , and if the errors in both can be reduced in significance comparisons could potentially provide very interesting constraints on the diffuse universe .      finally , to determine the cob and cib from our data we need to identify an appropriate fitting function . in this case",
    "the most straightforward option is to adopt a model which closely matches the data . shown on figs .",
    "[ fig : eblall ] &  [ fig : vhe ] is a model prediction from @xcite which is based on an update to the two - component phenomenological model of @xcite . in this model , we link spheroid formation to agn activity , and adopted the axiom that spheroid formation dominates at high - redshift . the variation of agn activity with redshift",
    "provides the shape , and the cosmic star - formation history provides the normalisation , for the star - formation history of spheroids only .",
    "the star - formation history of discs is then the discrepancy between the total cosmic star - formation history , and the spheroid star - formation history . with the star - formation history of spheroids and discs defined",
    ", we use a stellar population synthesis code and some underlying assumption of the metallicity evolution ( linear increase with star - formation ) , to predict the cosmic spectral energy distribution at any epoch , and compare to the available data at @xmath73 ( see @xcite for full details ) .",
    "the model has now been developed to included obscured and unobscured agn , bolstering the uv flux , as well as dust reprocessing and the model will be presented in detail in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eblplot2 ] we again show our eigl data compared to our adopted model which provides a reasonable fit across the full wavelength range shown .",
    "we perform a standard error - weight @xmath74-minimisation of the model against the data to determine the optimal normalisation and the @xmath52 error ranges on this normalisation .",
    "note that we fit the ebl data to the cob and cib separately , and while the overall normalisations agree the recovered @xmath52 errors are slightly broader for the cib data ( reflecting the large associated errors ) .",
    "we now integrate the ebl model using the @xmath75 ( integrate ) function from @xmath76 to 8@xmath0 m and @xmath77 to 1000@xmath0 m to obtain the total energy contained within the cob and cib .",
    "we find values of @xmath2 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 and @xmath5 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 respectively , essentially a 48:52% split .",
    "[ fig : compare ] shows some of the cob and cib measurements reported in the literature based on either integrated galaxy counts ( mauve ) , direct estimates ( cyan ) , numerical models ( red ) or vhe data ( green ) .",
    "our values agree well with previous eigl estimates , and in particular with the most recent cib measurement of @xcite ( @xmath78 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 ) .",
    "this should not be particularly surprising as our cib fits lean heavily on the bthermin source - count data , however the consistency in the measurement and errors is reassuring .",
    "in general we do see a trend , that the eigl values are the lowest , the direct estimates the highest , and that the vhe data is closer , but slightly higher , than the eigl estimates .",
    "this does imply that there may indeed be an additional diffuse component ( photon field ) at the @xmath79% level . as discussed above this",
    "could plausibly be due to some combination of low surface brightness galaxies , intra - halo light , and or any diffuse radiation from reionisation . at the moment the errors are to broad to draw any firm conclusion however , as observations improve in wide area imaging ( _ euclid , wfirst , lsst _ ) , and in vhe capabilities , there is a strong possibility of placing a meaningful constraint on this diffuse component . in our analysis the dominant errors in the cob , at least , are very much due to cosmic variance which are currently at the 5 - 10% level but can conceivably be reduced to below 1% in the near future .",
    "the normalised ebl model is available in machine readable format from the apj online edition .",
    "we have brought together a number of panchromatic datasets ( gama , cosmos / g10 , _ hst _ ers , uvudf and other mid and far - ir data ) to produce galaxy number counts which typically span over 10 magnitudes and from the far - uv to the far - ir .",
    "having homogenized the data , we apply a consistent methodology to derive an integrated galaxy light and an extrapolated galaxy - count light ( eigl ) measurement .",
    "the method avoids traditional galaxy number - count models and , as all datasets are bounded in terms of the contribution to the igl , are simply fit with a 10-point spline . integrating",
    "the spline with or without extrapolation then leads to a complete set of igl measurements from the far - uv to far - ir .",
    "our error analysis includes four key components : a systematic photometry and/or zero - point offset of @xmath35 mag in all datasets , a re - fit based on 8 or 12 point splines , 10,001 monte - carlo realizations of the random errors , and 10,001 monte - carlo realizations of the cosmic variance estimates .",
    "we combine the errors linearly to produce our final eigl measurements , which are accurate to 2 - 30% depending on bandpass .    in comparison to previous data",
    "we generally agree with previous igl measurements , agree with direct measurements in the far - ir , but disagree with direct measurements in the optical ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eblall ] , blue data points ) .",
    "we question whether the milky way or zodiacal light model requires revisiting for the direct optical and near - ir measurements .",
    "in particular we note ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eblplot2 ] ) that the direct estimates from _ pioneer _ agree well with our eigl estimates as do the constraints from very high energy experiments , suggesting a possible issue with the inner solar system dust model .",
    "we briefly acknowledge that the eigl measurements could potentially miss light from low surface brightness systems ( 0 - 20% ) and intra cluster / group light ( 0 - 35% ) .",
    "insofar as studies exists evidence suggests such emissions are likely small ( @xmath80% ) and within our quoted errors .",
    "however studies to further constrain both the space - density of low surface brightness galaxies and the intra - halo light would clearly be pertinent .",
    "finally we overlay the two - component model of @xcite , which now includes agn @xcite and find that we can explain the eigl distribution rather trivially in terms of a spheroid / agn formation phase ( @xmath81 ) , followed by disc formation ( @xmath82 ) . using a slightly modified version of the model as a fitting function",
    "we find that the cob and cib contain @xmath2 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 and @xmath5 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 respectively , essentially a 48:52% split .    over the coming years with the advent of wide - field space - based imaging , and in particular _",
    "euclid _ and _ wfirst _ , we note the great potential to constraint the uv , optical and near - ir optical backgrounds to below 1% .",

    "<S> we combine wide and deep galaxy number - count data from gama , cosmos / g10 , _ hst _ ers , _ hst _ uvudf and various near- , mid- and far- ir datasets from eso , _ spitzer _ and _ herschel_. the combined data range from the far - uv ( 0.15@xmath0 m ) to far - ir ( @xmath1 m ) , and in all cases the contribution to the integrated galaxy light ( igl ) of successively fainter galaxies converges . using a simple spline fit </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the igl and the extrapolated - igl in all bands . </S>",
    "<S> we argue undetected low surface brightness galaxies and intra - cluster / group light is modest , and that our extrapolated - igl measurements are an accurate representation of the extra - galactic background light . </S>",
    "<S> our data agree with most earlier igl estimates and with direct measurements in the far - ir , but disagree strongly with direct estimates in the optical . </S>",
    "<S> close agreement between our results and recent very high - energy experiments ( h.e.s.s . and magic ) , suggest that there may be an additional foreground affecting the direct estimates </S>",
    "<S> . the most likely culprit could be the adopted zodiacal light model . </S>",
    "<S> finally we use a modified version of the two - component model to integrate the ebl and obtain measurements of the cosmic optical background ( cob ) and cosmic infrared background ( cib ) of : @xmath2 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 and @xmath5 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 respectively ( 48:52% ) . over the next decade , upcoming space missions such as _ euclid _ and _ wfirst _ , have the capacity to reduce the cob error to @xmath6 , at which point comparisons to the very high energy data could have the potential to provide a direct detection and measurement of the reionisation field . </S>"
