    "the particle content of the standard model ( sm ) has been completed by the discovery of the 125 gev higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no clear signal beyond the sm in laboratory experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the cosmological problems such as the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) and identification of the cold dark matter still remain unsolved within the sm .",
    "one of the mechanisms for generating the bau is electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg )  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the bau arises during the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , and its feasibility depends on properties of models at the gev / tev scales . from the viewpoint of the testability , ewbg is the first scenario that is verified or falsified by the ongoing and upcoming experiments , among others .",
    "as is well known , the sm has the two drawbacks that prevent it from generating the bau : absence of both a strong first - order ewpt  @xcite and a sufficient amount of cp violation  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models may naturally solve those issues simultaneously .",
    "for example , in the the minimal susy sm model ( mssm ) , a light scalar top ( stop ) could induce the strong first - order ewpt , and the fermionic superpartners provide the substantial amount of cp violation .",
    "however , it turns out that the light stop scenario in the mssm is not consistent with the lhc run 1 data such as the higgs signal strengths and the direct stop searches  @xcite .",
    "given this fact , the colored particles may no longer the candidates for archiving the strong first - order ewpt .",
    "therefore , whatever a uv theory might be , the possibility of ewbg can be investigated in the framework of an effective field theory of non - colored particles after integrating out irrelevant heavy degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 experiments that are most sensitive to the cp violation are measurements of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of electron , neutron and atoms etc . clarifying relationships between the bau - related cp violations and the edms are indispensable for the test of the ewbg scenario . in some analyses in the literature ,",
    "the cp - violating effect is incorporated by higher dimensional operators assuming only one higgs doublet and by which the bau is evaluated .",
    "in such a case , the cp - violating effects peculiar to the finite temperature , such as a resonant enhancement pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , are missing , which drastically changes the correlation between the bau and edm .    in this letter",
    ", we clarify similarities and differences between the bau - related cp violation and the edm - related one with particular emphasis on the structure of the interactions and the mass dependences of the relevant particles . as an illustration",
    ", we consider a framework in which the higgs sector is augmented by an additional higgs doublet and a singlet , and in addition , su@xmath1 doublet fermions and singlet fermion are introduced to accommodate cp violation for baryogenesis . in our setup , the structure of the cp - violating interactions are more generic than those in susy models .",
    "we evaluate the cp - violating source term for the bau in the closed - time - path formalism and relate it with the electron edm .",
    "the correlation between the two cp - violating quantities is elucidated as functions of the ew - interacting fermion masses .    as a specific example",
    ", we consider a next - to - mssm - like model and work out the relationship between the bau and electron edm .",
    "it is found that the electron edm is the useful probe of the baryogenesis favored region as long as the bau - related cp violation predominately exists in the model .",
    "however , there is a case in which a bau - unrelated cp violation , if it exists , alters the intimate connection between the bau and edm , which makes it difficult to test ewbg via the electron edm experiment only . nevertheless , such a specific case is possible only in the case that the doublet - singlet higgs boson mixing exists , which is needed for a tree - potential - driven strong first - order ewpt , and thus still testable in combination with higgs physics .",
    "before going to present our model , we here give a simple but rather generic argument about the relationship between the bau - related cp violation and edm . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we consider the framework in which two higgs doublets and two species of ew - interacting fermions ( denoted as @xmath2 ) are present . for definite ,",
    "@xmath3 is assumed to be dirac fermion and @xmath4 majorana fermion .",
    "this setup applies to the bino - driven ewbg in the mssm  @xcite , the singlino - driven ewbg in the next - to - mssm  @xcite and the @xmath5ino - driven ewbg in the u@xmath6-mssm  @xcite in proper limits .",
    "we expect that the following discussion would hold in other cases by making an appropriate translation .",
    "let us parameterize the relevant interactions as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , and @xmath9 are the complex parameters . with this lagrangian",
    ", we evaluate the source terms in the diffusion equation of @xmath3 in the closed - time - path formalism  @xcite .",
    "the vector current of @xmath3 has the form @xmath10 where only the cp - violating source term is shown on the right - hand side .     with the higgs bubble walls , which leads to a dominant cp - violating source term for the bau.,width=207 ]    in a vev insertion approximation  @xcite , @xmath11 to leading order",
    "is induced by the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : self_fer ] , which is cast into the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 for @xmath14 , @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 are the masses of @xmath2 , @xmath20 is the time derivative of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denotes a thermal function as will be given below .",
    "one can see that @xmath23 would vanish not only for @xmath24 but also the cases in which one of the following condition is fulfilled : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "since the ewpt is of first order , the higgs vevs depend on a spacetime variable @xmath28 , and the profiles of which can be determined by static bubble configurations at a nucleation temperature . in most cases ,",
    "the shapes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 would be approximated by kink - type configurations , so the @xmath20 is proportional to a variation of @xmath30 along the line connecting broken and symmetric phases . in the mssm",
    ", @xmath20 roughly scales as @xmath31  @xcite , where @xmath32 is the cp - odd higgs boson mass , which implies that @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ scpv ] ) would completely disappear if the higgs sector is composed of only one higgs doublet , as already indicated in the case of @xmath17 . from this argument",
    ", it is expected that the presence of the extra higgs boson with a nonzero vev may be essential for successful ewbg , regardless of the strong first - order ewpt realization . here",
    ", it should be reminded that there is another type of the source term that is not suppressed in the large @xmath32 limit , which may appear as a higher order correction to the approximation we have made here ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as long as the bau",
    "is explained by a resonant enhancement , which is indeed the case in our analysis , such a source term would not play a central role .",
    "the behavior of the thermal function @xmath22 is somewhat complicated , and in some specific region it is strongly governed by the finite temperature physics .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath22 is  @xcite @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the thermal widths of @xmath38 . here , @xmath39 and @xmath40",

    "one can see that @xmath22 vanishes if @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represents a typical coupling in a model and @xmath47 a temperature , @xmath23 first emerges to order of @xmath48 assuming @xmath49 .    as is well known , @xmath11 has a resonant enhancement at @xmath50 , the behavior of which comes from @xmath40 . since @xmath51 , one may approximate @xmath40 as @xmath52 one can see that @xmath40 has a peak at @xmath53 , which can yield the dominant source for the bau .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     now , we define our model and give basic ingredients for calculating the bau and the electron edm .",
    "the particle content of the higgs and the new ew - interacting fermion sectors in the model is shown in table  [ charge_assign ] .",
    "the total lagrangian is given by @xmath54 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{1.5 cm } + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_{\\tilde{s}}+\\kappa s)\\tilde{s}^0\\tilde{s}^0+{\\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the two - component spinors , and @xmath57 . as is the case in the mssm , to avoid a lepton flavor violation",
    ", we impose a matter parity under which new ew - interacting fermions are odd and the sm fermions are even .",
    "furthermore , as in the ordinary 2hdm , another @xmath58 symmetry ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) is enforced to evade tree - level higgs - mediated flavor - changing - neutral current processes .",
    "depending on @xmath58 charge assignments for the fermions , four types of the yukawa interactions are possible .",
    "however , the following analysis does not depend on those types since the top yukawa coupling is the only relevant that is common to all the types .",

    "the detailed comparison between the two cases will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "since we have the singlet higgs boson in this model , @xmath68 mixes with @xmath69 through a mixing @xmath70 as @xmath71 in our scenario , @xmath72 is the sm - like higgs boson whose mass is @xmath73 gev , and @xmath74 is the singlet - like higgs boson which is assumed to be heavier than @xmath72 .",

    "<S> we study general aspects of the cp - violating effects on the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) and electric dipole moments ( edms ) in models extended by an extra higgs doublet and a singlet , together with electroweak - interacting fermions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the emphasis is on the structure of the cp - violating interactions and dependences of the bau and edms on masses of the relevant particles . in a concrete mode </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a relationship between the bau and the electron edm for a typical parameter set . as long as the bau - related cp violation predominantly exists </S>",
    "<S> , the electron edm has a strong power in probing electroweak baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> however , once a bau - unrelated cp violation comes into play , the direct correlation between the bau and electron edm can be lost . </S>",
    "<S> even in such a case , we point out that verifiability of the scenario still remains with the help of higgs physics . </S>"
