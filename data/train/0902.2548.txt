    "eclipsing binary stars are one of nature s best laboratories for determining the fundamental physical properties of stars and thus for testing the predictions of theoretical models . detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries ( hereafter ebs ) yield direct and accurate measures of the masses , radii , surface gravities , temperatures , and luminosities of the two stars .",
    "these are measured directly via combined analysis of multi - band light curves and radial velocity measurements ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "knowledge of the distance to the eb is not required , and thus the physical properties of the stars can be measured with exquisite accuracy . as an example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* morales et al .  ( 2008 ) ) have measured the component masses and radii of the low - mass eb cm  dra ( fig .",
    "[ cmdra ] ) with an accuracy better than 0.5% , perhaps the most accurate measurements ever made for a low - mass eb .",
    "similar accuracy has been achieved for the high mass @xmath7 aur ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* southworth et al .  2007 ) ) .",
    "indeed , at this level of precision , a non - negligible contributor to the error budget is the uncertainty on newton s gravitational constant ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* torres & ribas 2002 ) ) .",
    "such high quality measurements allow the predictions of theoretical models to be rigorously tested . for a main - sequence star of a given mass and metallicity ,",
    "the radius is a monotonic function of age .",
    "thus the models should assign the same age to the components of an eb ( i.e. , they should lie on a single model isochrone in , e.g. , the @xmath8@xmath9 plane ) , assuming that the components formed from the same material at the same time .",
    "the apparent difference in age , @xmath10 , of the two components is thus a direct measure of the error in the age calibration of the models . as we now discuss",
    ", the accuracy of the age calibration is principally a function of stellar mass , varying from @xmath2% for @xmath11 m@xmath1 , to @xmath6% for @xmath12 m@xmath1 , to 5090% for @xmath13 m@xmath1 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "in general , theoretical models perform best in predicting coeval ages in main - sequence ebs with @xmath15 . for example , ( * ? ? ?",

    "they find @xmath17% for the typical case and @xmath18% for all of the ebs in their sample .",
    "this excellent performance of the models includes a few ebs near the terminal - age main sequence ( tams ) , where the stars are evolving very rapidly toward the red giant phase and for which any discrepancies in the models are amplified .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ xiphe ] shows the case of @xmath19 phe , a particularly challenging eb with a 2.6  m@xmath1 secondary and a 3.9  m@xmath1 primary that is leaving the main sequence .",

    "a good example is cv boo , an old main - sequence eb with component masses of 1.03 and 0.97 m@xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* torres et al .",
    "the primary shows evidence for having entered the h shell - burning stage , for which the predicted model age of 8 gyr is in good agreement ( fig .",
    "[ cvboo ] ) . however , the secondary appears to be 25% older due to its radius being @xmath6% larger than predicted by the 8 gyr isochrone .",
    "the oversized radius of the secondary is likely due to its magnetic activity ( see  [ activity ] ) .    of course , the sun is the only star for which an absolute age can be determined directly ( e.g. , chemical dating of meteorites ) . while the sun s physical properties can by matched to better than 1% at the solar age by models that incorporate all of the observational constraints ( including , e.g. , helioseismology )",
    ", the sun s age can not be predicted to better than @xmath23% if given only its observed mass , radius , temperature , and metallicity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young & arnett 2005 ) ) .",
    "this is likely to be the best absolute accuracy that can be achieved with current models applied to ebs with a similar set of observational constraints .",
    ", width=211 ]      the past several years have seen rapid progress in the number of low - mass ebs that have been discovered and their components analyzed .",
    "a consistent finding among these studies is that the observed stellar radii are 1020% larger than predicted by the models .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lpez - morales ( 2007 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ribas et al .  ( 2008 ) ) have compiled the literature data for low - mass ebs with @xmath24 .",
    "they find that in virtually all cases the theoretical main sequence predicts radii smaller than those observed ( fig .",
    "[ bigradii ] ) .",
    "these oversized radii make the stars appear 5090% older or younger than expected ( depending on whether post or pre  main - sequence models are used ; see also fig .",
    "[ cvboo ] ) .",
    "importantly , there are now several low - mass ebs for which there exist independent age constraints ( e.g. , yy gem , v818 tau , v1061 cyg ) , and in these systems the same age discrepancies are verified ( fig .",
    "[ yygem ] ) .",
    "a few ebs in young open clusters have also been found ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * hebb et al .",
    "2006 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* southworth et al .  2004 ) ) , again verifying these trends .",
    "more ebs such as these with independent age determinations are very much needed .         .",

    "there is now very good evidence that the unexpectedly large radii of low - mass ebs is related directly or indirectly to magnetic activity on these stars .",
    "several of the authors who published the original analyses of low - mass ebs had noted that the stars showing larger - than - predicted radii also show evidence for activity , in the form of h@xmath25 emission , x - rays , spot - modulated light curves , and other tracers .    more recently ,",
    "* lpez - morales ( 2007 ) ) has demonstrated the relationship explicitly ( fig .",
    "[ activity - fig ] ) .",
    "this is very good news , not only because it points clearly to an underlying cause for the observed oversized radii , but also because the tight correlation with x - ray luminosity suggests that this effect can be calibrated and the ages corrected . indeed ,",
    "single - lined ebs  which can be regarded as effectively single stars and which are thus less likely to have magnetic activity driven through interactions with a companion  do not show systematically oversized radii ( fig .  [ bigradii ] , right ) .",
    "in addition , recent modeling that incorporates the effects of magnetically suppressed convection in low - mass stars due to magnetically active surfaces is now able to fit the observed oversized radii of active ebs extremely well ( fig .  [ chabrier - fig ] ) .",
    "in addition , these models simultaneously can explain the systematically low effective temperatures of these stars .        in these new models , strong magnetic fields",
    "cause a suppression of convection near the surface .",
    "heat flow to the surface is inhibited ( by analogy to dark sunspots on the sun ) , resulting in a decrease in the star s effective temperature . however , the star s overall luminosity is roughly fixed by internal processes far removed from the surface boundary condition , and thus the star s radius adjusts to a larger size in order to radiate the flux .",
    "it should be stressed that at present these models use parametrizations of surface spots and of suppressed convection in place of a full physical treatment of convection and surface fields .",
    "even so , several additional lines of evidence corroborate this general picture .",
    "first , the observed properties of young , low - mass ebs are in general best fit by model isochrones with low convective efficiency , @xmath26 ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mathieu et al .  2007 ) ) .",
    "second , the observed surface lithium abundances of young , low - mass ebs clearly indicate weak convective mixing ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stassun et al .  2004 ) ) .",
    "third , analyses of low - mass ebs have found that indeed the luminosities of the stars are in good agreement with the models even when the radii and temperatures are very discrepant .",
    "for example , in the brown - dwarf eb 2m053505 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stassun et al .  2006 ) ) , the brown dwarfs display @xmath27 oversized radii , and the temperature of the very active primary ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reiners et al .  2007 ) ) has been so severely suppressed that it is in fact cooler than the lower - mass secondary .",
    "however , the luminosities remain in good agreement with model predictions for brown dwarfs at an age of @xmath4 myr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stassun et al .  2007 ) ) .",
    "finally , these findings have implications for low - mass stars more generally .",
    "first , because activity has the effect of decreasing the effective temperature but leaving the luminosity relatively unaffected , we can expect to see these stars scattered horizontally in the h - r diagram .",
    "second , these effects will need to be taken into account when deriving ages from other means , such as age - activity relations and surface lithium abundances .",
    "testing the accuracy of stellar evolutionary models via the @xmath10 test , as we have done above , assumes that ebs represent _ coeval _ systems of two stars that formed from the same material at the same time .",
    "indeed , in many cases , this assumption of the coevality of eb components has been used to calibrate the various input parameters of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young & arnett ( 2005 ) ) have adjusted model parameters such as core overshooting , and have determined secondary stellar properties such as metallicities , on the basis of requiring that the evolutionary tracks yield the same model ages for the two stars of an eb .",
    "similarly , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* luhman ( 1999 ) ) has adjusted the temperature scale of young , low - mass stars on the basis of requiring that pre ",
    "main - sequence evolutionary tracks yield coeval ages for the components of pre  main - sequence binaries .",
    "star from the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "dotted lines show the result of changing the stellar mass by 0.015 m@xmath1 uncertainty in the measured masses .",
    "vertical error bars on the points represent the combination of measurement and systematic uncertainties .",
    "horizontal error bars represent the range of ages for which the theoretical models are consistent with the measurements within the uncertainties ( including systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "note that the uncertainties in the temperatures , radii and luminosities are not independent between the two stars , because they are connected by precisely determined ratios ; thus , for example , the primary star can not be forced cooler while simultaneously forcing the secondary warmer .",
    "the nominal age of the orion nebula cluster in which this eb is found is @xmath4 myr .",
    "adapted from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stassun et al .  ( 2008 ) ) . , width=508 ]    we now have evidence that , in at least some cases , the components of very young binaries may not in fact be strictly coeval .",
    "in particular , par 1802 is a recently discovered eb in the orion nebula , with a mean age of @xmath4 myr , whose components are identical in mass to within 2% ( @xmath28 m@xmath1 ; ( * ? ? ? * stassun et al .",
    "2008 ) ) . having the same mass ,",
    "these ` identical twin ' stars are predicted by the models to have identical temperatures , radii , and luminosities .",
    "however , the components of par 1802 are found to have different temperatures ( @xmath29k , or about 10% ) , radii that differ by 5% , and luminosities that differ by a factor of @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ stassun ] ) .",
    "these surprising dissimilarities between the two stars can be interpreted as a difference in age of @xmath31% .",
    "it has been speculated that this age difference likely reflects differences in the star formation history of the two stars , differences that may be specific to binary star formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* simon et al .  ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , if such non - coevality turns out to be a common feature of young binaries , then par 1802 suggests that using very young ebs to calibrate the evolutionary model ages may be limited to @xmath5% accuracy .",
    "fortunately , these effects are largely erased after @xmath6 myr .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ? * stempels et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) find that the components of asas j052821@xmath320338.5 , a solar - mass eb with an age of 12 myr , are coeval to @xmath33% .",
    "the central importance of ebs for stellar age determinations implies an ongoing need for precise and accurate eb data . as sky surveys are gaining on both precision and diversity , and since more and more medium",
    "size observatories are being refurbrished into fully robotic telescopes , there is a  fire - hose \" of photometric and spectroscopic data coming our way .",
    "methods to reduce and analyze the data thus can not rely on manual labor any longer ; rather , automatic approaches must be devised to face the challenge of sheer data quantity .",
    "pioneering efforts of automating the analysis of survey data by several groups , most notably wyithe & wilson ( 2001 , 2002 ) , wyrzykowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , devor ( 2005 ) , and tamuz et al .",
    "these are reviewed in pra & zwitter ( 2007 ) .",
    "a recent stab at automation is implemented within the eclipsing binaries via artificial intelligence project ( ebai ; pra et al .",
    "a back - propagating neural network is applied as a non - linear regression tool that maps eb light curves onto a subset of parameter space that is sensitive to photometric data .",
    "its performance has been thoroughly tested on detached eb light curves ( fig .",
    "[ prsa ] ) and applied successfully to ogle data . in a matter of seconds , the network is able to provide principal parameters of tens of thousands of ebs .",
    "the results that come from such an engine may be readily used to select those ebs that are most interesting for the studies of stellar formation and evolution . given the number of surveys , we are talking thousands of interesting ebs !",
    "since our understanding relies on these systems , such a disproportionate jump in data quantity will surely provide further insights and enhance statistical significance of our results ."
