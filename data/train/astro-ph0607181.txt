    "the origin of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is one of the most challenging problems in modern astrophysics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields on the order of @xmath8 g are detected in galaxies as well as in clusters of galaxies .",
    "it is generally assumed that the coherent large scale @xmath0 g magnetic fields observed in disk galaxies are amplified and maintained by an @xmath9 dynamo , which continuously generates new fields by the combined action of differential rotation @xmath10 and helical turbulence @xmath11 . however , the dynamo mechanism needs seed magnetic fields and sufficient time in order to amplify them .",
    "there have been many attempts to explain the origin of seed fields .",
    "one of the most popular is that they are generated by the biermann mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this mechanism acts in diverse astrophysical systems , such as large scale structure formation @xcite , cosmological ionizing fronts @xcite , and formation of supernova remnants of the first stars @xcite .",
    "outflows is an additional means of filling protogalaxies with magnetic fields .",
    "for example , in section iii .",
    "g , we discuss outflows of magnetic fields from extragalactic jets , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "another suggestion for the origin of seed fields is that they were created by different mechanisms in the very early universe , before galaxy formation took place .",
    "for example , such fields may have been created during the quark - hadron phase transition ( qhpt ) , when the universe was at a temperature @xmath12 ( section iii .",
    "a ) , during the electroweak phase transition ( section iii .",
    "b ) , or in the inflation era ( section iii .",
    "one major difficulty with most scenarios for the creation of magnetic fields in the very early primordial universe ( @xmath13 1 sec ) , such as those discussed in  3.1 - 3.3 , is the small coherence lengths of the fields at redshifts _ z _ @xmath14 10 .",
    "the coherence length is limited by the radius of the horizon at the time of the creation of the magnetic field . when expanded to the present time , the coherence length is too small to explain the existing observed large coherent magnetic fields on the order of the size of galaxies .    in this paper , we suggest that the observed magnetic fields have their origin in the electromagnetic fluctuations in the hot dense plasmas of the very early universe .",
    "this is a natural way to create magnetic fields and circumvents the problem of small coherence lengths .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation - theorem predicts very large magnetic fields in the equilibrium plasma immediately after the qhpt .",
    "we evolve these fields to a redshift @xmath15 , when galaxies were beginning to form and find them to be sufficiently strong to explain the magnetic field observations in both high and low redshift galaxies .",
    "we investigate the magnitude of the present magnetic fields in galaxies and the intergalactic medium created by the plasma fluctuations shortly after the quark - hadron - phase transition ( qhpt ) , when the plasma properties are well understood .",
    "the magnetic fields , created by the plasma fluctuations before the qhpt , are poorly understood and we leave their evaluation for a future investigation .    using the fluctuation - dissipation - theorem ( fdt ) , @xcite studied the magnetic fluctuations as a function of frequency in the primordial nucleosynthesis era and found that they were very large , in particular , at zero frequency .",
    "this can be compared with the black body prediction which has a zero amplitude magnetic fluctuation at zero frequency .",
    "@xcite suggested that the large magnetic fluctuations predicted by the fdt at an early epoch did not dissipate , but continued to exist to the present epoch and now contribute to the dominant magnetic field .",
    "this scenario is investigated in detail here .",
    "since the largest magnetic fluctuations in the plasma occurred shortly after the qhpt , we begin our calculations at this epoch .",
    "primordial magnetic fields can effect the incoming directions of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) above @xmath16 ev . in the last section ( section vi )",
    "we discuss the possible importance of our predicted primordial magnetic fields on uhecrs .",
    "we review the observations of astrophysical magnetic fields in section ii previous suggestions for creating primordial magnetic fields are given in section iii .",
    "the creation of magnetic fields in the fluctuations of the hot dense primordial plasma is discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v , we discuss our model , based on the analysis in section iv .",
    "our conclusions as well as a discussion of our results are presented in section vi .",
    "the magnetic fields in our galaxy have been studied by several methods .",
    "measurements of the zeeman effect in the 21 cm radio line in galactic hi regions reveal magnetic fields @xmath17 g . similar values for the magnetic fields in other galaxies have been obtained from faraday rotation surveys .",

    "high resolution frms of high _ z _ quasars allow for the probing of magnetic fields in the past . a magnetic field of @xmath0 g in a relatively young spiral galaxy at _ z _",
    "= 0.395 was measured by frms from the radio emission of the quasar pks 229 - 021 , lying behind the galaxy , at _ z _ = 1.038 @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields @xmath20 g are also observed in @xmath21 clouds at redshifts _ z _ @xmath4 2.5 @xcite .",
    "there have been various scenarios suggested for the source of primordial magnetic fields . in this section ,",
    "we review some of the most important ones .      in the magnetogenesis scenario at the quark - hadron phase transition ( qhpt ) , proposed by @xcite , an electric field",
    "was created behind the shock fronts due to the expanding bubbles of the phase transition .",
    "the baryon asymmetry , which was presumed to have already been present , resulted in a positive charge on the baryonic component and a negative charge on the leptonic component of the primordial plasma , so that the charge neutrality of the universe was preserved . as a consequence of the difference between the equations of state of the baryonic and leptonic fluids , a strong pressure gradient was produced by the passage of the shock wave , giving rise to a radial electric field behind the shock front . @xcite",
    "estimated the strength of the electric field to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of the energy density of the two fluids , @xmath24 , @xmath25p is the pressure gradient , and _",
    "l _ is the average comoving distance between the nucleation sites .",
    "they suggested that non- negligible fields were produced when shock fronts collided , giving rise to turbulence and vorticity on scales of order _ l_. it was found that the magnetic field produced on the comoving scale @xmath2 au has a present magnitude @xmath4 @xmath26 g.    @xcite showed that strong magnetic fields might have been produced during the coexistence phase of the qhpt , during which a baryon excess builds up in front of the bubble wall as a consequence of the difference of the baryon masses in the quark and hadron phases . in this scenario ,",
    "magnetic fields were generated by the peculiar motion of the dipoles , which arose from the convective transfer of the latent heat released by the expanding walls .",
    "the field created at the qhpt was estimated by @xcite to be @xmath27 g at the present epoch , on a comoving coherence length @xmath28 . on a comoving galactic length scale , they estimated the field to be @xmath29 g.    @xcite predicted a present magnetic field",
    "@xmath30 g. however , they used very special conditions , such as efficient amplification by hydromagnetic instabilities during the qhpt .",
    "there have been some suggestions made for the origin of primordial magnetic fields based on the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) .",
    "a first order ewpt could possibly have generated magnetic fields @xcite . during the ewpt ,",
    "the gauge symmetry broke down from the electroweak group @xmath31 to the electromagnetic group @xmath32 .",
    "the transition appears to have been weakly first order , or possibly second order , depending upon various parameters , such as the mass of the higgs particle @xcite .",
    "if it were first order , the plasma would have supercooled below the electroweak temperature , @xmath33 gev .",
    "bubbles of broken symmetry would have nucleated and expanded , eventually filling the universe . at the time of the ewpt , the typical comoving size of the hubble radius and the temperature were @xmath34 10 cm and @xmath35 100 gev , respectively .",
    "a comoving bubble of size @xmath36 would have been created with @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the fluids would have become turbulent when two walls collided .",
    "fully developed mhd turbulence would have led rapidly to equipartition of the field energy up to the scale of the largest eddies in the fluid , assumed to have been comparable to @xmath38 .",
    "the magnetic field strength at the ewpt would have been @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy density at the time of the ewpt @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields could also have arisen in cosmological phase transitions even if they were of second order @xcite . in the standard model ,",
    "the ewpt occurred when the higgs field @xmath41 acquired a vacuum expectation value @xmath42 . to estimate the field strength on larger scales",
    ", @xcite assumed that @xmath41 executed a random walk on the vacuum manifold with step size @xmath43 . over a distance @xmath44 , where n is a large number , the field @xmath41 changes on the average by @xmath45 . on a comoving galactic scale ,",
    "l = 100 kpc , at the recombination era ( @xmath46 ) , @xcite found a magnetic field @xmath47 g.      inflation naturally produced effects on large scales , very much larger than the hubble horizon , due to microphysical processes operating in a causally connected volume before inflation @xcite .",
    "if electromagnetic quantum fluctuations were amplified during inflation , they could appear today as large - scale coherent magnetic fields .",
    "the main obstacle to the inflationary scenario is the fact that in a conformally flat metric , such as the robertson walker , the background gravitational field does not produce relativistic particles if the underlying theory is conformally invariant @xcite .",
    "this is the case for photons , for example , since classical electrodynamics is conformally invariant in the limit of vanishing fermion masses ( i.e. , masses much smaller than the inflation energy scale ) .",
    "several ways of breaking conformal invariance have been proposed .",
    "@xcite considered three possibilities :    1 .   introducing a gravitational coupling , such as @xmath48 or @xmath49 , where r is the ricci scalar , @xmath50 the ricci tensor , and",
    "@xmath51 is the electromagnetic field .",
    "these terms break gauge invariance and give the photons an effective time - dependent mass .",
    "@xcite showed that for some suitable ( though theoretically unmotivated ) choice of parameters , such a mechanism could give rise to galactic magnetic fields , even without invoking the galactic dynamo ; 2 .   introducing terms of the form @xmath52 or @xmath53 , where m is some mass scale , required by dimensional considerations .",
    "such terms arise due to one loop vacuum polarization effects in curved space - time .",
    "they can account , however , for only a very small primordial magnetic field ; and 3 .",
    "coupling of the photon to a charged field that is not conformally coupled or anomalous coupling to a pseudoscalar field .",
    "@xcite proposed a model invoking a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of electromagnetism , implying non - conservation of the electric charge in the early evolution of the universe .",
    "@xcite investigated the generation of magnetic fields by the biermann battery in cosmological ionization fronts , using simulations of reionization by stars in protogalaxies .",
    "they considered two mechanisms : 1 ) the breakout of ionization fronts from protogalaxies ; and 2 ) the propagation of ionization fronts through high - density neutral filaments .",
    "the first mechanism was dominant prior to the overlapping of ionized regions @xmath54 , whereas the second mechanism continued to operate after that epoch as well .",
    "after overlap , the magnetic field strength at @xmath55 closely traced the gas density and was highly ordered on comoving megaparsec scales .",
    "the present mean field strength was found to be @xmath56 g in their simulation .",
    "their results corroborate those of @xcite .",
    "the generation of magnetic fields by nonminimal coupling was investigated by @xcite . from general relativity",
    ", it can be shown that if we have a mass spinning at the origin , the space time metric @xmath57 is equal to the vector product of the angular momentum l and the radial vector r , times @xmath58 , where g is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xcite suggested that the magnetic field created is proportional to the curl of @xmath59 , where the proportionality constant @xmath60 was used , based on the data of the planets in our solar system @xcite .",

    "the spin parameter was @xmath62 .",
    "they found present galactic magnetic fields @xmath4 0.58 @xmath6 g for a decoupling redshift @xmath64 = 100 and noted that galactic magnetic fields @xmath0 g could be produced by this mechanism without the need for dynamo amplification .",
    "primordial supernova explosions could also be the origin of magnetic fields in the universe @xcite .",
    "the scenario investigated was a generic multicycle explosive model , in which a population iii object collapsed and then exploded , creating a shock .",
    "matter was swept up by the shock , increasing the density by a factor of 4 ( for the case of a strong shock ) .",
    "this matter was heated to a high temperature , which then cooled down .",
    "eventually spheres of radii of approximately half the shell thickness formed and subsequently collapsed into population iii stars",
    ". they then exploded , starting a new cycle .",
    "the supernova shells produced eventually coalesced .",
    "it was assumed that the gradients of temperature and density in the resultant shell were not parallel and that , therefore , a magnetic field was created due to the biermann mechanism .",
    "the rate of change of the magnetic field with time is equal to the vector product of the density gradient and the temperature gradient times @xmath65 , where n is the particle density and @xmath66 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "it was found that this process creates a galactic seed magnetic field @xmath67 g , which could be later amplified by a dynamo mechanism .",

    "turbulence has been suggested as the primordial source of magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite has made a detailed study of this scenario .",
    "we summarize here their analysis and results and compare them with the analysis and results of the present paper .",
    "it was assumed by @xcite that non - standard out - of - equilibrium stochastic magnetic fields were created at high cosmic temperatures t @xmath70 mev - 100 gev , corresponding to quark - hadron or electroweak phase transitions .",
    "their numerical simulations were performed using the zeus-3d code .",
    "gaussian random fields were used to create the non - standard initial turbulent fluctuations . a power - law with distance @xmath71 was assumed for the magnetic amplitudes , ( @xmath72 , n = 1 - 2 ) .",
    "the initial stochastic velocity field was generated in the same way as the initial magnetic field .",
    "a correlation length scale l was defined which contains most of the magnetic and fluid kinetic energy .",
    "the dissipation of the energy into heat occurs via energy cascading from large eddies ( @xmath4 l ) to small eddies ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "ever since the work of kolmogorov , it has been known that cascading of energy occurs due to eddies on a scale @xmath71 breaking up into smaller eddies ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "typical energy dissipation times due to the eddy flows from large to small flows are given by the eddy turnover time on the scale l. in the article of @xcite , the turnover time on the scale",
    "l is comparable to the hubble time .",
    "thus the turbulent energy introduced in the magnetogenesis era is dissipated in one hubble time .",
    "for example , the dissipation time is @xmath75 s for the quark - hadron transition .",
    "the predicted present magnetic field in this turbulent eddy scenario depends on the turbulent spectrum assumed at the quark - hadron or electroweak phase transitions .",
    "@xcite found the present magnetic field to be correlated with the comoving correlation length @xmath76 : b @xmath77 g , where @xmath76 is measured in pc .",
    "typically , it was found that @xmath78 ( eq .",
    "( 52 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the turbulent eddy scenario , with the large eddy energy transfers to small scales , where energy dissipation rapidly occurs , typically predicts @xmath67 g on @xmath79 pc scales .",
    "there can be substantial energy transfer to larger scales if the turbulent magnetic field possesses some magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "the above can be compared with the magnetogenesis in the present paper , due to the natural fluctuations in thermal equilibrium plasmas .",

    "they have an average intensity @xmath82 = @xmath83 , where t is the temperature . describing the magnetic fluctuations as dipoles ,",
    "the magnetic field over a distance @xmath71 due to the randomly oriented magnetic fields follows a power law : @xmath84 .",
    "this power law dependence is similar to the power law dependence in the turbulent magnetogenesis model , but without a transfer of energy from large to small scales . for a thermal equilibrium plasma , the eddy turnover velocity of size",
    "@xmath71 is the thermal rotation velocity of the mass of plasma with a diameter @xmath71 . in the power - law spectrum @xmath85 with @xmath86 , the eddy turnover time is greater than the hubble time .",
    "there is thus negligible energy transfer from the large scale @xmath71 to the small scale @xmath87 . on the small scale @xmath87 , dissipation ,",
    "has already been taken into account by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the present predicted magnetic field in our magnetogenesis model can be compared with the predicted magnetic field of the turbulent eddy model . whereas , in the turbulent eddy model , a present magnetic field @xmath67 g over a comoving correlation length @xmath79 pc is predicted , our model predicts a present magnetic field @xmath88 g over a comoving length @xmath89 1 pc .",
    "the predicted magnetic field in our model is , thus , nine orders of magnitude greater ( over a comoving length two orders of magnitude greater ) than that in the turbulent magnetogenesis model .",
    "this large difference is due to the fast energy transfer from large to small dissipation scales in a hubble time in the turbulent magnetogenesis model , which does not occur in our model .",
    "thermal electromagnetic fluctuations are present in all plasmas , including those in thermal equilibrium , the level of which is related to the dissipative characteristics of the medium , as described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite [ see also @xcite ] .",

    "this plasma was composed primarily of electrons , photons , neutrinos , muons , baryons and their antiparticles .",
    "the baryons were essentially stationary and did not contribute to the fluctuations while the muons also contributed very little and for a very short time . since neutrinos are essentially massless and act qualitatively like photons , albeit with much smaller cross sections , we assume that they also affect the magnetic fluctuations very little .",
    "therefore we consider only an electron - positron - photon plasma before the electron - positron annihilation era and an electron - proton plasma thereafter .",
    "most of the electromagnetic fluctuations in the primordial plasma that were created immediately after the qhpt fall into two broad categories : those with large wavelengths ( k @xmath14 @xmath120/c ) at near zero frequency ( @xmath93 @xmath13 @xmath120 ) and those with very small wavelengths ( k @xmath121 @xmath120/c ) and frequencies greater than @xmath120 .",

    "magnetic field fluctuations are created immediately after the qhpt as predicted by the fdt , which we evolve to the recombination era and beyond .",
    "magnetic field fluctuations are also predicted to be created by the fdt at the recombination era .",

    "magnetic fields were adiabatically amplified at _ z _ @xmath4 10 as the baryon matter collapsed to form galaxies .",
    "although the magnetic energy density of neighboring magnetic dipoles is of the same order as the energy density of the average magnetic field when they are not at the average distance from each other , the magnetic energy density appreciably increases when the neighboring dipoles approach each other . since the field of a dipole is proportional to @xmath135 , where r is the distance from the dipole , the magnetic energy density of neighboring dipoles is proportional to @xmath136 . decreasing the separation distance by a factor of 2(4 ) for example ,",
