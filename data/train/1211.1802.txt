    "calculation of continuum states corresponding to processes where a particle hits a bound @xmath0-body system requires in principle knowledge of the corresponding @xmath4-body wave function at large distances . needless to say ,",
    "the technical difficulties one has to face in order to obtain the wave function increase dramatically with @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , already for @xmath5 , calculation of the three - body wave function is far of being trivial .",
    "however , even if knowledge of the @xmath4-body wave function is unavoidable , the possibility of reducing the distance at which such wave function is needed is in itself an important step forward in the description of the reaction . as shown in @xcite , this",
    "can indeed be done by means of two integral relations that are based on the kohn variational principle .",
    "these two integral relations are a generalization to more than two particles of the integral relation given in @xcite , and they permit to obtain the @xmath6- ( or @xmath7)-matrix of the reaction by using only the internal part of the wave function . therefore , all the physical information concerning a given @xmath8 reaction can be obtained without an accurate knowledge of the asymptotic part of the wave function .",
    "the fact that the asymptotic part is not needed anymore leads to a drastic reduction of the computer effort required to extract the @xmath6-matrix .",
    "the only condition necessary to obtain accurate second - order estimates of the @xmath6-matrix through the integral relations is that the trial wave function must fulfill the schrdinger equation only in the interaction region .",
    "this means that , for instance , scattering states can be described with bound - state - like trial wave functions @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the integral relations were implemented to describe @xmath9 reactions below the breakup threshold . when used in combination with the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method the dimension of the @xmath6-matrix describing the reaction",
    "is dictated by the number of adiabatic potentials related to the possible outgoing elastic or inelastic channels , which typically is very small .",
    "furthermore , thanks to integral relations , the convergence of the @xmath6-matrix in terms of the adiabatic channels included in the expansion of the wave function is highly accelerated . actually , the pattern of convergence is similar to the one found when the same method is used for the description of bound states @xcite .",
    "this is in fact not a minor issue , since as proved in @xcite , when used to describe low - energy scattering states , the convergence of the adiabatic expansion slows down significantly , even to the point that an accurate calculation of the @xmath6-matrix would require infinitely many adiabatic terms in the expansion , what in practice makes the procedure useless .",
    "the success of the method for energies below the breakup threshold immediately suggests its extension to describe low - energy breakup reactions . in this case",
    "the dimension of the @xmath6-matrix is not finite , since contrary to the elastic and inelastic channels or transfer reactions , the full three - body continuum states are described by infinitely many adiabatic potentials .    the first goal of this work is to generalize the method described in @xcite for @xmath8 reactions to energies above the threshold for breakup of the bound target .",
    "this generalization will be shown in section ii , where a short summary of the method described in @xcite will be given . in section iii ,",
    "the @xmath10 reaction , for which a series of benchmark calculations are available @xcite , will be used as a test of the method .    the second goal , which will be discussed in section iv , concerns the use of the new method to investigate the @xmath2he+@xmath2he@xmath3 atomic reaction above the dimer breakup threshold .",
    "the case of the @xmath11 state will be considered . in particular ,",
    "we will focus on the use of soft - core @xmath2he-@xmath2he potentials . as shown in @xcite , the use of an attractive gaussian potential reproducing the same two - body properties as a standard hard - core potential ( like for instance the lm2m2 potential ) leads to equivalent bound three - body systems and phase - shifts for the elastic @xmath2he+@xmath2he@xmath3 reaction , but only once that the soft - core potential is used together with a three - body short - term force .",
    "the possibility of using the same kind of potentials also to describe the breakup channel is interesting , since it automatically eliminates all the technical difficulties arising from the presence of a hard - core repulsion in the potential ( see for instance ref.@xcite ) .    finally , we close this work with a short summary and the conclusions .",
    "in refs.@xcite @xmath9 reactions were described within the framework of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method for energies below the threshold for breakup of the dimer .",
    "therefore , only elastic , inelastic , and transfer processes were possible .",
    "since the formalism is described in great detail in ref.@xcite , here we just summarize its main aspects , which are given in the first part of this section .",
    "in particular , we will focus on those key points that will permit an easier understanding of the generalization of the method to energies above the two - body breakup threshold , which will be shown in the second part of the section . in the last part we will describe the integral relations , which are actually the tools that permit to extract the @xmath6-matrix of the reaction from the internal part of the wave functions .      given a three - body system ,",
    "the corresponding wave function within the frame of the adiabatic expansion method is written as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the usual jacobi coordinates , and @xmath15 are the hyperradius and the five hyperangles obtained from @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the wave function has a well defined total angular momentum @xmath16 , but for simplicity in the notation we omit this index ( and its projection ) in the expression above .    in hyperspherical",
    "coordinates the hamiltonian operator @xmath17 takes the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hyperradial kinetic energy operator , @xmath20 contains all the dependence on the hyperangles , and @xmath21 is an arbitrary normalization mass .    the angular functions @xmath22 , which form the complete basis used for the wave function expansion ( [ eq1 ] ) , are actually the eigenfunctions of @xmath20 , @xmath23 in such a way that the adiabatic effective potentials @xmath24 enter in the coupled set of radial equations that permit to obtain the radial functions @xmath25 , @xmath26 f_n(\\rho ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\sum_{n'\\neq",
    "n } \\left ( -2 p_{n n ' } \\frac{d}{d\\rho } - q_{n n ' } \\right)f_{n'}(\\rho ) = 0    \\label{eq4b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 where the subscript @xmath28 indicates integration over the hyperangles only ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "a typical behavior of the adiabatic potentials is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "they correspond to a three - body system where two of the two - body subsystems have a bound state .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the two lowest effective adiabatic potentials go asymptotically to the binding energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 of each bound two - body system .    in the figure",
    "the different regions defined by the energy of the incident particles are depicted .",
    "all the three - body energies @xmath31 such that @xmath32 ( like @xmath33 in the figure ) correspond to processes where only one channel is open . only the elastic collision between the third particle and the bound two - body state with energy @xmath29 is possible",
    "when the three - body energy increases up to the region @xmath34",
    "( @xmath35 in the figure ) a second channel is open .",
    "two different collisions are now possible , the one where a particle hits the bound state with binding energy @xmath29 , and the one where a particle hits the state with binding energy @xmath30 . in the same way ,",
    "each of these reactions has two possible outgoing channels , corresponding to the two allowed bound two - body states and the third particle in the continuum . in other words , in this energy range the inelastic ( if the two bound two - body states correspond to the same subsystem ) or transfer ( if the two bound two - body states correspond to different subsystems ) channel is open .",
    "when @xmath36 ( like @xmath37 in the figure ) , the breakup channel is also open , and it is described by the remaining infinitely many adiabatic potentials .    the coupled system of radial equations ( [ eq4b ] ) decouple asymptotically , and each of the radial wave functions behave at large distances as dictated by : @xmath38    when @xmath39 corresponds to a closed channel the radial wave function @xmath40 vanishes asymptotically . for values of @xmath31 below the two - body breakup threshold ,",
    "as considered in @xcite , and for a given incoming @xmath9 channel , only outgoing @xmath9 channels are allowed ( either elastic , inelastic , or transfer ) . in this case , as shown in @xcite , the equation above describing the asymptotic behavior of the open - channel wave functions becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the relative angular momentum between the dimer and the third particle , @xmath43 refers to the modulus of the jacobi coordinate between the center of mass of the outgoing bound two - body system and the third particle , and @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the binding energy of the bound two - body system associated to the open channel @xmath39 .    with this in hand , it is not difficult to see @xcite that the asymptotic form of the corresponding three - body wave function is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 refers to the incoming channel , @xmath48 is the number of open channels ( all of them @xmath9 channels ) , and @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the usual regular and irregular bessel functions ( provided that we are dealing with short range potentials ) .    as shown in @xcite , eq.([eq7 ] ) can be written in a compact matrix form as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a column vector with @xmath48 terms corresponding to the @xmath48 open channels , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57 matrices made by the @xmath58 and @xmath59 elements in eq.([eq7 ] ) , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are again column vectors whose @xmath48 terms are given by eqs.([eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "from the equation above it is clear that the @xmath6-matrix of the reaction is given by : @xmath62 this matrix is real , and from it one can easily obtain the @xmath7-matrix as @xmath63 .",
    "when the total three - body energy @xmath31 in a @xmath9 reaction is above the threshold for breakup of the dimer , the first consequence is that infinitely many adiabatic channels are then open ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath64 ) .",
    "of course , still a finite number of them correspond to elastic , inelastic , or transfer processes , and the infinitely many remaining ones describe the breakup channel .",
    "therefore , in this case the corresponding @xmath6- ( or @xmath7- ) matrix has infinite dimension .    in any case , for the finite open channels corresponding to outgoing @xmath9 structures , the expressions given in the previous subsection are still valid .",
    "this means that for these particular outgoing channels the three - body wave function behaves asymptotically as given by eq.([eq7 ] ) , and eqs.([eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) are still valid .    on the other hand , the breakup channels are characterized by the fact that the effective potentials @xmath65 associated to them go asymptotically to zero as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the grand - angular quantum number defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath42 are the orbital angular momenta associated to the jacobi coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath70 . therefore , asymptotically",
    ", each breakup adiabatic potential is associated to a fixed value of @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , the corresponding angular eigenfunction @xmath22 is , also asymptotically , a linear combination of hyperspherical harmonics with that particular value of @xmath67 .",
    "when inserting ( [ eq13 ] ) into ( [ eq5 ] ) , we easily obtain that , asymptotically , the radial wave function for an outgoing breakup channel @xmath39 satisfies the equation : @xmath71 f_{n}(\\rho)=0,\\ ] ] which is formally identical to the eq.([eqas ] ) , which is satisfied by the radial wave functions associated to outgoing @xmath9 channels , but replacing @xmath42 by @xmath72 , @xmath73 by @xmath74 , and @xmath43 by @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , in the more general case where the breakup channel is open , and assuming an incoming @xmath9 channel @xmath47 , the asymptotic form of the corresponding three - body wave function is given by : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are still given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , but of course , with the understanding that when @xmath39 corresponds to an outgoing breakup channel the replacements @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 have to be made ( note that the relations @xmath82 and @xmath83 permit to write eqs.([eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) in terms of the bessel functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which is how the asymptotic form of the breakup channels is usually presented in the literature ) .    of course , the matrix form in eq.([eq11 ] ) of the asymptotic wave function can still be used .",
    "as before , the @xmath6-matrix of the reaction is given by @xmath86 , but now the matrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 have in principle infinite dimension and some truncation is then required .",
    "due to the fact that the hyperradius @xmath75 appears as the natural radial coordinate describing the asymptotic behavior of the breakup channels , we then have that , for these channels , the adiabatic expansion is able to reach the correct asymptotic behavior for a sufficiently large , but finite , value of @xmath75 .",
    "for this reason , for processes without @xmath9 open channels ( @xmath87 processes ) , the @xmath6-matrix could in principle be extracted with sufficient accuracy from the asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , this is not true when @xmath9 channels are open . for these channels the correct asymptotic form ( described by ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) ) can not be reached until the jacobi coordinate @xmath88 and hyperradius @xmath75 are equal , which only happens at infinity .",
    "therefore it is essential in this case to use a formalism in which the @xmath6-matrix is not extracted from the asymptotic part of the wave function but from its internal part .",
    "the derivation of the integral relations has been shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "this derivation is completely general , and it is not particularized to the case of incident energies below the breakup threshold .",
    "therefore , the same expressions derived in @xcite apply when the breakup channel is open . according to it , by making use of the kohn variational principle",
    ", it has been proved that when using a trial three - body wave function @xmath89 , one can obtain the matrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 accurate up to second order in @xmath90 , and their matrix elements are given by : @xmath91 where @xmath92 describes each possible incoming channel and the index @xmath93 refers to each possible outgoing channel ( either @xmath9 or breakup ) .    in this work",
    ", the trial three - body wave function will be the one obtained as sketched in subsection [ sub2a ] . to be precise , it will be obtained by solving the faddeev equations by means of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .    since the regular and irregular functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 are asymptotically solutions of @xmath94 , it is then clear that the integral relations ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) depend only on the short - range structure of the scattering wave function @xmath89 .",
    "it is important to note that the function @xmath61 , defined in eq.([eq9 ] ) , is irregular at the origin . in order to avoid the problems arising from this fact ,",
    "the @xmath61 function is regularized .",
    "this means that in eq.([eq17 ] ) the bessel function @xmath95 contained in @xmath61 is actually replaced by another function that goes to zero at the origin and behaves exactly as @xmath95 at large distances . in @xcite",
    "this was done by using @xmath96 , where @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) is a parameter . however ,",
    "in our case , where the index @xmath99 can reach pretty high values ( @xmath100 in the breakup channels ) this procedure is not appropriate .    in this work",
    "we have regularized the irregular bessel function by solving eq.([eq5 ] ) for each individual adiabatic potential .",
    "the solutions of this equation behave asymptotically as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the phase - shift , and the index @xmath103 is equal to @xmath42 for the @xmath9 channels , and @xmath72 for the breakup channels . then , the irregular bessel function implicitly contained in eq.([eq17 ] ) is replaced by : @xmath104 which by construction is regular at the origin and goes asymptotically to @xmath105 .",
    "the benchmark solutions for neutron - deuteron breakup amplitudes are shown in @xcite .",
    "for this reason we take this case as a test for the method shown in this work .",
    "in particular , the nucleon - nucleon interaction is chosen to be the revised malfliet - tjon i - iii model @xmath1-wave potential @xcite , which for the spin triplet and singlet cases takes the form : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is given in fm , and the potential in mev .",
    "also , @xmath108=41.47 mev @xmath109 .",
    "the potential above leads to a binding energy for the deuteron of 2.2307 mev .    in the calculation",
    "only @xmath1-waves are considered .",
    "therefore , two different total angular momenta are possible , the quartet case ( @xmath110 ) , for which only the triplet @xmath1-wave potential ( [ eq19 ] ) enters , and the doublet case ( @xmath111 ) , for which both , the singlet and the triplet potentials contribute . in fig.[fig2 ] we show the computed adiabatic effective potentials ( eq.([eq5 ] ) ) for the doublet case .",
    "as you can see , they follow the general trend of the potentials shown in fig.[fig1 ] , although in this case there is only one @xmath9 channel , which corresponds to the neutron - deuteron reaction that we want to investigate .",
    "the corresponding adiabatic potential is given by the thick - solid line in the figure , and it will be labeled as channel 1 . as expected , the asymptotic value of this potential corresponds to the binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath7-matrix implies that given an incoming channel , for instance channel 1 ( @xmath112 channel ) , we have that @xmath113 , or , in other words , @xmath114 which means that an accurate calculation of the elastic term @xmath115 amounts to an accurate calculation of the infinite summation of the @xmath116 terms ( @xmath117 ) corresponding the breakup channels .    also , the complex value of @xmath115 can be written in terms of a complex phase - shift @xmath118 as : @xmath119    .inelasticity parameter @xmath120 for the neutron - deuteron scattering for two different laboratory neutron beam energies ( 14.1 mev and 42.0 mev ) for the doublet and quartet cases .",
    "the value of @xmath121 is the @xmath67-value associated to the last adiabatic potential included in the calculation .",
    "the numbers within parenthesis have been obtained without use of the integral relations .",
    "the last row gives the value quoted in ref.@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the importance of the inclusion of the three - body force is also seen when investigating the @xmath122 reaction for incident energies ( @xmath123 ) above the threshold for breakup of the dimer , i.e. , @xmath124 ( or @xmath36 ) . in table  [ tab4 ] we give the inelasticity ( @xmath120 ) and the real part of the phase - shift ( re(@xmath118 ) ) for energies @xmath125 and @xmath126 mk .",
    "as in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] , @xmath121 is the grand - angular quantum number associated to the last adiabatic term included in the expansion ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the boldface numbers have been obtained when the three - body force has been included in the calculation ( @xmath127 k and @xmath128 a.u . ) , and the results within parenthesis have been obtained without the three - body force .",
    "as we can see , the pattern of convergence is similar to the one observed in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] for the neutron - deuteron reaction .",
    "a @xmath121 value of around 12 is enough to get a rather well converged inelasticity , while re(@xmath118 ) requires a few more adiabatic terms in order to reach convergence .",
    "similarly to what found in @xcite for energies below the breakup threshold , the inclusion of the three - body force gives rise to relevant changes in the computed values .",
    "these changes are particularly noticeable for re(@xmath118 ) , which for the two energies under consideration increases up to 6 degrees when the three - body force is not included in the calculation .",
    "also , we observe that for @xmath125 mk the breakup probability ( @xmath129 ) is still rather small , clearly smaller than 1% ( with three - body force ) , while for @xmath126 mk this probability rises up to 17% ( 12% without three - body force ) .    with the @xmath7-matrix in hand , we can now compute the dissociation rate for the @xmath122 collision .",
    "the analytic form of this rate is given in ref.@xcite , and for @xmath11 states it becomes : @xmath130 where @xmath131 @xmath132 is the mass of the @xmath2he atom , and @xmath123 is the incident energy in the center of mass frame ( @xmath133 is the binding energy of the @xmath134 dimer ) .    in fig.[fig3 ]",
    "we show the dissociation rate as a function of the three - body energy @xmath31 .",
    "the thin - dashed and thin - solid lines are the results obtained with the gaussian soft - core potential ( [ soft ] ) without and with the additional three - body force ( [ 3b ] ) , respectively .",
    "the low energy behavior of the dissociation rate follows the @xmath135 rule derived in @xcite , where @xmath136 is the smallest grand - angular quantum number associated to the continuum adiabatic channels ( @xmath137 in our case of three indistinguishable bosons coupled to @xmath138 ) .    from the figure",
    "we can see that the effect of the three - body force is quite important .",
    "in fact , for small energies the three - body force reduces the rate by a factor of 2 . at higher energies , beyond 10 mk , the effect is the opposite , and the three - body force increases the rate by a factor close to 1.5 .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the same dissociation rate has been computed .",
    "the corresponding curve is shown in fig.[fig3 ] by the dotted curve .",
    "as we can see , there is an important difference compared to our calculation . except at high energies ( @xmath139 mk ) , where our result ( with three - body force ) and the one in @xcite basically coincide , for small energies",
    "our rate is about a factor of 3 bigger .",
    "however , we have to note that the hard - core two - body potential used in @xcite gives rise to somewhat different dimer properties compared to the soft - core potential ( [ soft ] ) and the lm2m2 potential @xcite . in @xcite",
    "they have used the potential based on the symmetry - adapted perturbation theory ( sapt ) derived in @xcite .",
    "the two - body properties obtained with this potential are given in the last column ( upper part ) of table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the two - body dimer is 20% more bound than with the lm2m2 potential , and therefore the scattering length and the interatomic distance are smaller than in the lm2m2 case .    to investigate the sensitivity of the dissociation rate to the details of the two - body interaction we have then constructed a second gaussian soft - core potential reproducing the two - body properties of the sapt potential .",
    "this potential takes the form : @xmath140 where the strength is given in k and the range in a.u .. the corresponding two - body properties are given in the fourth column ( upper part ) of table  [ tab3 ] under the label `` soft - core 2 '' .",
    "again , when moving to the three - body system , this new soft - core potential presents the same deficiencies as the previous one , i.e. , overbinding of the three - body bound states and a too small atom - dimer scattering length .",
    "as before , this problem is solved by inclusion of the three - body force , whose parameters are again fitted to reproduce the ground state binding energy of the helium trimer provided by the sapt potential . the three - body properties with and without three - body force , as well as the parameters used for the three - body force are given in the last three columns ( lower part ) of table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "making use of this new soft - core potential and the corresponding three - body force , we can compute again the dissociation rate ( [ disso ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig3 ] by the thick - dashed curve ( no three - body force ) and the thick - solid curve ( with three - body force ) .",
    "the new rates are now smaller than the ones obtained with the previous soft - core potential .",
    "furthermore , when the three - body force is included , and therefore not only the two - body properties but also the three - body ones agree with the ones obtained with the sapt potential , our dissociation rate and the one given in @xcite agree well for the whole range of energies . only a small difference can be seen at about 1 mk .",
    "we can therefore see that the dissociation rate is very sensitive to the details of the two - body interaction .",
    "an additional 20% binding of the dimer , and the corresponding decrease in the scattering length , leads to a factor of 3 decrease in the rate .",
    "the same conclusions are reached when investigating the recombination rate corresponding to the inverse process @xmath141 .",
    "this rate is given by the same @xmath7-matrix elements as in the dissociation case , and its analytical form for three identical bosons with angular momentum and parity @xmath11 is given by @xcite : @xmath142 where @xmath143 @xmath132 is the mass of the @xmath2he atom , and @xmath31 is the total three - body energy .",
    "the computed recombination rate is shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the meaning of the curves is as in fig.[fig3 ] . in ref.@xcite the recombination rate @xmath144",
    "was proved to behave at low energies as @xmath145 ( @xmath136 is the smallest grand - angular quantum number associated to the continuum adiabatic channels ) , which means that in our case , where @xmath137 , @xmath144 should be constant at very low energies , as observed in the figure .",
    "again , inclusion of the three - body force reduces the rate by a factor of 2 to 3 at small energies ( compare the dashed curves and the corresponding solid curves in the figure ) .",
    "also , when the soft - core potential ( [ soft2 ] ) together with the three - body force is used , the computed recombination rate agrees well with the rate given in @xcite ( dotted curve in the figure ) .",
    "this fact reveals again the importance of the fine details of the two - body interaction .",
    "finally , it is important to emphasize that in this work the @xmath7-matrix has been obtained by use of the integral relations ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) . as explained , they have the great advantage of needing only the internal part of the wave functions .",
    "in fact , the integrals involved in the calculations shown in this section can be safely performed with a maximum value for the hyperradius @xmath75 of 4000 a.u .. even less could be enough",
    ". however , in @xcite , where the adiabatic expansion was also used , the radial wave functions in eq.([eq1 ] ) had to be expanded up to @xmath146 a.u . , which is definitely very delicate from the numerical point of view .",
    "in this paper we have extended the use of the integral relations derived in @xcite to describe 1 + 2 reactions above the threshold for breakup of the dimer . as in @xcite ,",
    "the integral relations are used in combination with the adiabatic expansion method in order to construct the trial wave function .",
    "the main consequence of moving up to energies above the breakup threshold is that the @xmath7-matrix describing the process has now infinite dimension .",
    "this was not the case for energies below the threshold , where the elastic , inelastic , or transfer channels were described by a finite ( and small ) number of adiabatic terms .",
    "the applicability of the method has been tested with the neutron - deuteron reaction , for which benchmark calculations are available .",
    "the agreement with these calculations is good , and the pattern of convergence is similar to the one found in @xcite for energies below the breakup threshold .",
    "the integral relations accelerate the convergence significantly , and typically about 10 adiabatic terms are enough to get a rather well converged result .    the method has then been used to investigate reactions involving three helium atoms . in particular",
    "we have focused on the possibility of using soft - core atom - atom potentials in order to describe the full process .",
    "these potentials permit to avoid all the technical problems arising from the use of more sophisticated potentials where a hard - core repulsion is always present .",
    "however , as already shown in @xcite , even if the soft - core potentials reproduce properly the dimer properties , an effective three - body force is needed in order to reproduce as well the properties of the trimer bound states and the atom - dimer scattering length obtained with the hard - core potentials .",
    "we have found that the three - body force also modifies significantly the inelasticity and the phase - shift for energies above the breakup threshold .",
    "in fact , when computing the reaction rates for dissociation of the dimer ( @xmath147 ) and for the recombination process ( @xmath141 ) the three - body force decreases the rates even by a factor of 3 at low energies .",
    "these two rates are also very sensitive to the details of the two - body interaction .",
    "we have found that a two - body potential , like the sapt potential , providing a dimer state about 20% more bound than the one obtained with the lm2m2 potential , also reduces the rates by a factor of around 3 at small energies .",
    "the soft - core potential reproducing the two - body properties of the sapt potential , together with the corresponding three - body forced designed to reproduce the trimer properties as well , gives then rise to reaction rates in very good agreement with the ones of the sapt potential .    in summary ,",
    "the integral relations are also useful in order to describe reactions above the breakup threshold .",
    "they accelerate significantly the convergence of the @xmath7-matrix terms . for reactions involving hard - core two - body potentials ,",
    "the use of soft - core potentials with the same two - body properties are a very good alternative , provided that they are used together with an effective three - body force designed to fit as well the bound state three - body energies .",
    "when this is done , the reaction rates obtained with the hard - core and the soft - core potentials agree pretty well .",
    "these rates are very sensitive to the details of the two - body interaction .",
    "small variations of the dimer properties can produce sizable changes in the reaction rates at low energies .",
