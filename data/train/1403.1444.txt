    "understanding and categorising the initially quiescent phases of massive ( @xmath88 ) star formation is _ essential _ if we are to develop a complete picture of how massive stars form .",
    "once star formation is under way , the disruptive effect of stellar feedback destroys the primordial information needed to explain their formation .",
    "consequently , the search for massive starless cores ( the dense precursors to massive stars ) , requires the identification of relatively _ quiescent _ clouds , that have yet to be affected by feedback from massive young stellar objects .    infrared dark clouds ( hereafter , irdcs ) ,",
    "were discovered as extended structures , silhouetted against the bright mid - infrared ( mir ) emission observed towards the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "irdcs are categorised as having large - masses ( @xmath210@xmath9 ; @xcite , hereafter kt13 ) , high - column densities ( @xmath10@xmath210@xmath11@xmath12 ; @xcite ) , and low temperatures ( @xmath1320k ; @xcite ) , making them ideal environments to study the _ initial conditions _ of star formation .",
    "in addition , the high mass surface densities ( @xmath20.3g@xmath12 ; @xcite , hereafter bt12 ) and high volume densities ( @xmath210@xmath14@xmath15 ; @xcite , bt12 ) of irdc clumps are most akin to regions of massive star formation @xcite .    this study is the sixth instalment of a series of papers whose goal is to provide a detailed case study of the chemistry , dynamics , and physical structure of a single irdc , .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , bt09 ) selected 10 irdcs ( due to their high - contrast against the galactic mir background ) from the sample of 38 irdcs studied by @xcite . from this sample , , cloud h of bt09 , was chosen for further study because : i ) it has one of the most extreme filamentary morphologies in the @xcite study ; ii ) it exhibits extended quiescent regions with little or no signatures of star formation activity ( 4.5 , 8 , 24  emission ; @xcite ) ; iii ) it is relatively nearby , with a kinematic distance of @xmath2 2900pc @xcite .",
    "since 2010 ,  has been revealed to be an extremely complex , globally virialised structure ( paper iii ; @xcite ) , consisting of several , morphologically distinct filaments ( paper iv ; @xcite ) exhibiting common velocity gradients ( paper v ; @xcite ) , that is in an early stage of evolution ( paper ii ; @xcite ) .",
    "paper i @xcite , discovered the presence of faint and narrow sio emission ( @xmath31 ) , traced over parsec scales in .",
    "two main suggestions were put forward to explain this emission : i ) a population of widespread , and undetected low - mass protostars ( the iram30 m beam at @xmath287ghz is @xmath228 ) ; ii ) the emission may be a large - scale shock product of the cloud formation process . whilst a population of deeply - embedded protostars can not be ruled out without higher - angular resolution observations of shocked gas tracers ,",
    "the second scenario above is supported by two conclusions : i ) widespread co depletion indicates that the irdc is in an early stage of evolution , and is unaffected by stellar feedback ( on global scales ; paper ii ) ; ii ) in paper iv , a velocity shift between the dense gas ( as traced by ) and the highly abundant , lower - density envelope material ( as traced by ) was observed , that may be indicative of the interaction between filaments .",
    "the presence of widespread sio at the intersection point of filaments , has also recently been identified in g028.2300.19 @xcite .",
    "paper iv revealed the presence of three filamentary structures of varying density : filament 1 , a blue - shifted low - density filament ( traced mainly by , with minimal ) ; filament 2 , the main irdc filament ; filament 3 , a red - shifted component observed in both  and  ( this density structure was later confirmed in the lvg analysis of paper v ) .",
    "in addition , these filaments appear to intersect at the location of the most massive core within the mapped region , h6 ( mass @xmath260  within a radius of 0.15pc ; bt12 ) .    whilst there is evidence that some irdcs exhibit multiple velocity components ( e.g. ; papers iv & v , see also @xcite ) , there are very few studies dedicated to understanding the internal kinematics of their filamentary structures , and how this may relate to star formation . in this paper , a detailed kinematic study of  at high - angular resolution ( @xmath24 ) is presented .",
    "the focus is the analysis of  ( ) ; a well - known dense gas tracer , with the  transition having a critical density of @xmath16=1.4@xmath510@xmath17@xmath15 ( at 10k ) . during the earliest stages of low - mass star formation ,",
    "typically traces the cold , dense cores ; i.e. the precursors to stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . in high - mass star - forming regions , however , regions of high - density can extend over parsec scales , resulting in the widespread emission of  ( paper iv ) .",
    "this makes  an ideal diagnostic tool for a detailed study of the kinematic behaviour of the dense filamentary structures in .",
    "in addition , 3.2 mm continuum emission maps are used for comparison with the  data .",

    "the merging of the two data sets was completed within the gildas software package , mapping , by using ` uvshort ' .",

    "it is clear from figure[figure : ii ] that the peak in  emission ( at offset 1.67,22.59 ) and the peak of h6 , as determined from extinction mapping ( bt12 ) , are spatially coincident ( within a single pdbi beam ) .",

    "there are also localised areas of high - velocity ( see offset 5,-25 ) .",
    "since moment analysis is insensitive to multiple spectral features , this may indicate regions where additional velocity components affect the overall trend ( see section[section : kinematics ] ) .",
    "a map of the velocity dispersion is shown in the right - hand panel of figure[figure : ii ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion is fairly constant across , with a mean value of 0.45 , with the exception of a notable increase towards the south - west of h6 ( peak value @xmath81 ) .",
    "this location coincides with red - shifted velocity peaks evident in the 1@xmath31 order moment map . in paper iv ,",
    "a high - velocity component ( filament 3;@xmath247 ) was shown to overlap spatially with the `` main '' irdc filament ( filament 2;45.63 ) at the location of h6 .",

    "this equates to a mach number of @xmath22 ( @xmath36=0.23 , using a mean mass per molecule of 2.33a.m.u . ) , similar to those found in paper v. the velocity dispersions found are most similar to regions of massive star formation , in which non - thermal motions dominate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure[figure : box_plot ] displays the integrated intensity ( colour scale , between 0.0  4.0k ) at the six locations highlighted by the black boxes in the left - hand panel of figure[figure : ii ] ( these locations have been selected to show a range of spectral features ) .",

    "a dotted line at 45.8  ( the mean centroid velocity within the map , as calculated from the moment analysis displayed in the central panel of figure[figure : ii ] ) , is highlighted in each spectrum , for reference .",
    "the profiles of the  spectra vary throughout the cloud . in three out of the six regions mapped ( regions 2 , 3 , and 4 )",
    "there is strong evidence for the presence of multiple velocity components , with further evidence in the remaining regions . referring back to figure[figure : ii ] , regions 2 , 3 , and 4 cover the bulk of the emission around h6 . within the vicinity of h6 ,",
    "substructure not evident in the single - dish maps of paper iv is detected ( see section[section : kinematics ] ) .",
    "how the intensity of the emission changes with respect to the velocity of the gas can be seen in the channel maps in figure[figure : chan ] .",

    "these velocity components , can now be resolved both spectrally _ and _ spatially . in the 46.5  panel",
    ", it is evident that filament 3 follows a different portion of the extinction map compared to the main bulk of material observed at lower velocities .",
    "the bulk of the  emission exists between 45.046.5 .",
    "it appears as though the component identified previously as filament 2 ( paper iv ; @xmath30@xmath245.63 ) , can now be subdivided into two structures .",
    "this is most evident in panels 45.0  and 46.0 , respectively , with 45.5  displaying a transition between the two ( this is also evident in the spectra of figure[figure : box_plot ] ) .",
    "these components are referred to as f2a and f2b ( f2a is the more blue - shifted of the two ; see figure[figure : chan ] ) .",
    "although f2a and f2b are similar in their emission peaks , there are some notable discrepancies .",
    "firstly , f2a is more prominent in the southern portion of the mapped region , up to h6 .",
    "f2b , is more prominent in the north .",
    "secondly , not all emission peaks are directly coincident .",
    "for instance , the peak observed in the north in f2b ( offset @xmath2 - 5,50 ; see 46.0  panel ) is not evident in f2a ( see 45.0  panel ) .    since f2a is more prominent south of h6 , and f2b to the north , treating these two components as a single entity would result in a velocity field that appears to show an abrupt change in velocity at the position of h6 .",
    "this velocity change at the position of h6 was noted in paper iv ( and was also discussed in paper v , studying various transitions of co isotopologues ) , and is indeed observed in the moment analysis here ( central panel , figure[figure : ii ] ) . if we are to understand the complex kinematics within , then the existence of multiple velocity components poses a significant problem that needs to be addressed .",
    "special attention is committed to this topic in section[section : kinematics ] .",
    "this short section is devoted to a discussion on the optical depth of the  ( ) line emission . in paper iv ,",
    "the hyperfine structure of  ( ) was utilised to show that the isolated component was optically thin ( mean _ total _ optical depth over all 7 hyperfine components @xmath33 , i.e. an optical depth of the isolated component , @xmath20.33 ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of multiple velocity components in  could be verified as the line profiles were similar to the optically thin  ( the optical depth of  was estimated to be @xmath391 in the densest portion of the mapped region ; paper iii ) .    in this analysis ,",
    "no optically thin tracer was available .",
    "however , the line is assumed to be optically thin for the following reasons : i ) this study utilises only the isolated hyperfine component of  ( ) , which has a statistical weight of @xmath20.11 @xcite ; ii ) if the presence of multiple components was simply an effect attributed to the optical depth , then one would assume that multiple velocity components would be restricted to the high - density regions .",
    "however , this is not the case ; there is also evidence for multiple velocity components away from h6 ; iii ) multiple peaks are also evident in the  ( ) spectra ( 9  resolution from the iram30 m antenna ; see paper iv ) , and these peaks align ( within uncertainties ) with those observed in the pdbi data , when smoothed to an equivalent resolution .",
    "the fact that the  ( ) line does not peak in between f2a and f2b ( as would be expected if the  transition was optically thick , and the  transition , thin ) suggests that they trace similar kinematics , and the  isolated hyperfine component is not significantly affected by optical depth effects ; iv ) figure[figure : ii_ext ] shows the  ( ) integrated intensity versus mass surface density over the whole cloud . since there is a strong correlation between these two properties ( r - value@xmath20.7 ) , and no plateau",
    "is observed towards higher extinction ( as expected in the case of optical depth effects ) , this also suggests that the isolated component of  ( ) is optically thin ; v ) multiple component hyperfine structure fits have been performed ( where possible ; see appendix[section : tau ] ) , and the fit results are consistent with the isolated components being optically thin .",
    "thus , it is likely that f2a and",
    "f2b are independent velocity features .      the column density of the  ( ) line can be estimated by scaling the integrated intensity of the isolated hyperfine component by its statistical weight ( 0.11 ; assuming it is optically thin ) .",
    "the scaled integrated intensity is then used with equation a4 in @xcite : @xmath40 in this analysis , @xmath41 represents the integrated intensity across _ all _ of the isolated components ( i.e. irrespective of multiple components ) scaled by the statistical weight ( @xmath42 , whereby @xmath43 is the relative statistical weight @xmath20.11 ) , @xmath44 is the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission ( 3.63@xmath510@xmath6s@xmath7 ; @xcite ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the statistical weights for the upper and lower states , respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the equivalent rayleigh - jeans excitation and background temperatures . the excitation temperature was estimated from the output parameters of a fit to the hyperfine structure , using gildas / class , at the offset of _ peak _  emission ( 1.67,22.59 ) , giving a value of @xmath27.4k .",
    "@xmath49 is the partition function , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the wavelength and frequency of the  transition , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the boltzmann and planck constants , respectively .",
    "this equation can therefore be reduced to : @xmath54 the column density is estimated for every pixel in the map .",
    "the column density at offset ( 1.67,22.59 ) is ( 4.7@xmath40.5)@xmath510@xmath55@xmath12 .",
    "the mean value over the map is estimated to be = ( 1.3@xmath40.2)@xmath510@xmath55@xmath12 . in the extreme case whereby the optical depth of each of the isolated hyperfine components approach @xmath56@xmath21 , a correction factor of @xmath21.6 would need to be made to the column density .",
    "however , a case such as this is not observed , and so the correction factor would typically be @xmath31.6 . in appendix[section :",
    "tau ] an example spectrum is shown ( offset=3.6,12.7 , i.e. close to the h6 region ) , with a multiple - component hyperfine structure fit . in this example , corresponding @xmath56 values of the isolated hyperfine components are all @xmath31 .    as the integrated intensity is directly proportional to the column density ( in the optically thin case ) , the correlation derived in figure[figure : ii_ext ] can be used to estimate a fractional abundance of  molecules , with respect to h@xmath57 ( as derived from the mass surface density ) . assuming a mean mass per molecule of 2.33a.m.u .",

    "as shown in section[section : results ] , a high - degree of complexity is observed in the  ( ) emission towards .",
    "fitting these data is challenging for a number of different reasons : i ) there are multiple velocity components along the line of sight ; ii ) the velocity separation between components is @xmath31  ( comparable with the typical fwhm observed ; see right - panel of figure[figure : ii ] ) ; iii ) each of these velocity components is likely to exhibit its own velocity structure across the filament , leading to blending of the spectral features . in paper",
    "iv we developed a simple fitting routine ( dubbed the guided gaussian fit ) , that enabled us to separate the molecular line data into individual components .",
    "the gaussian fitting of the pdbi data , however , poses a more significant challenge due to the additional structure observed in the high - angular resolution map .",
    "analysis of the pdbi data has been performed using a semi - automated gaussian fitting procedure .",
    "briefly , the technique works by assuming that the profiles of the spectra remain _ relatively _ constant over suitably small angular distances ( @xmath390.1pc ) .",
    "therefore , one can reduce the number of spectra to fit by only fitting the average spectrum within a user defined area ( see appendix[app : filamentfinder ] for details ) . the output values from the fit to the average spectrum are then used as free - parameter inputs to each spectrum within the area . by overlapping areas , multiple fits are performed to a single spectrum .",
    "this ensures a _ smooth _ transition between adjacent areas . a minimisation technique",
    "is then used to compare fits to individual spectra , selecting the `` best fit '' .",
    "individual velocity components are then grouped using an algorithm devoted to seeking out similar components within a user defined area .",
    "this algorithm follows the same underlying principles as the `` friends in velocity '' , five , algorithm developed by @xcite , in that velocity components are grouped based on how closely they are linked in both position and velocity _ simultaneously _",

    "it is possible that these components may represent compact , high - density portions of filament 1 , that are not observed in the low - angular resolution  maps of paper iv ( perhaps due to beam dilution ) .",

    "f3 has a positive gradient in the north  south direction , 0.30@xmath40.04  ( measured between -25@xmath39@xmath34@xmath3970 ) .    small velocity gradients over the whole cloud indicate that the gas motions are relatively quiescent ( in the north - south direction ) . however , _ local _ fluctuations along each filament axis , are large compared to the overall gradient . for instance , between 10@xmath39 @xmath34 @xmath3940 , f2a and f3",
    "show opposing velocity gradients of magnitude @xmath21.5 .",
    "in addition , velocity gradients may exist in the east  west direction .",

    "this gives us a better idea of the spatial extent of the velocity gradients , but they are not included in any analysis due to their lower significance ( see section[section : gradients ] for further description of the velocity gradient analysis ) .",
    "it is stressed that , _ the arrows in the velocity gradient analysis do not indicate the direction of flow of gas , they simply point towards the direction of increasing velocity_. therefore , depending on the orientation , and physical structure of the cloud , there could be several explanations for the observed velocity structure . in this discussion two _ opposing _ scenarios are considered that may explain the observed pattern of velocity gradients : i ) infalling material , or ii ) outflowing material .      due to the symmetry in the arrow pattern towards the sw core , we focus on this continuum peak for further discussion . in the infall scenario",

    "the mean magnitude of the velocity gradients towards the sw core is @xmath22.5  over a spatial extent of @xmath20.5pc .",

    "however , @xcite show that if the source is located to the near , or far side of the natal filament / cloud , then emission ( of the filament / cloud ) in the pv plane would be in a u - shape , either red - shifted or blue - shifted away or towards the observer , respectively .",
    "relating this back to core n , the observed emission pattern in the pv analysis may indicate the interaction between an embedded protostar and the surrounding dense gas ( and this may therefore be analogous to the sw core ) .",
    "similar structures are also observed towards the sw core ( see ` c'-shaped structures in slices b4b6 in figure[figure : hor_b ] , which dissect the sw core ) .",
    "however , such patterns may simply be explained due to the emergence of additional components ( also note that f3 is detected away from the sw core ; c.f . slices a0a4 in figure[figure : hor_a ] ) . this is therefore inconclusive .",
    "it is noted however , that the velocity gradient arrows of f2a show a similar pattern to those seen in f3 , but in the opposite direction , i.e. arrows point away from the sw core ( see figure[figure : vlsr ] ) .",
    "the fact that the apex of both the f2a and f3 structures are not directly coincident ( there is a positional separation of the apex of 0.17pc ) , could be explained by a an asymmetric expansion of the shell .",
    "the expanding shell scenario would suggest that the sw continuum core is situated at an intermediate velocity between f2a and f3 ( i.e. at a velocity most similar to f2b @xmath246 ) .",
    "one can crudely estimate the momentum of the swept up material using : @xmath113 whereby @xmath114 is the mass of the shell ( i.e. of filament f3 ) estimated in the previous section ( 34.5@xmath417 ) , @xmath115 is the peak velocity in the system , and @xmath116 is the velocity at the boundary of the velocity gradient analysis .",
    "the velocity difference @xmath117 is @xmath20.7 , which gives a momentum of @xmath224@xmath412 .",
    "this momentum is smaller than those observed towards expanding shells in perseus ( typical values @xmath8100 , although it is dependent on the mode of star formation ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the observed spatial extent of the perseus shells are larger ( @xmath21pc , compared with 0.2 - 0.3pc in ) . however , @xcite report smaller cavities ( of the order 0.10.2pc ) , with velocity widths @xmath21 - 3  in ngc1333 , comparable to the peak velocity difference between f2a and f3 ( see figure[figure : vlsr_dec ] ) . in this scenario ,",
    "`` filaments '' or , more correctly , shells in  may have originally made up a single structure that has subsequently been separated as a natural consequence of the dynamic process of star formation .",
    "it must be noted however , that whilst there is _ some _ evidence for broad red - shifted emission of co ( 1 - 0 ) at the sw core , no blue - shifted emission is evident at the location of the f2a apex .",
    "in addition , in the region of the sw core , filaments f2a and f3 provide contributions of 49% and 46% , to the total integrated intensity ( the remaining 5% is attributed to f2b ) , respectively .",
    "this would suggest therefore , that if the continuum peak was situated at an intermediate velocity , this position is almost devoid of  emission , as it has been `` swept up '' by the expanding shell .",
    "however ,  emission is typically detected in the regions surrounding forming protostars ( e.g. @xcite ) , rendering this unlikely . finally , as evidenced in figure[figure : dv ] , no obvious broadening of the lines is observed towards the apex of these structures . if f2a and f3 are treated as a single ( expanding shell ) entity , as in the moment analysis of figure[figure : ii ] , a broadening of the dispersion is observed .",
    "however , as can be clearly seen from offset location ( -4.24,10.77 ) in figure[figure : exam_spec ] , there are two _ gaussian _ components , that show no evidence of line - wings . follow - up high - angular resolution observations of molecular outflow , and shocked gas tracers are needed in order to validate this scenario .",
    "the `` simple '' picture of  appearing as a single filamentary structure in the extinction map of kt13 , is a deceptive one .",
    "previous single - dish studies ( papers i , iv , & v ) have revealed that  is in fact comprised of multiple filamentary structures along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , these filaments overlap towards the position of the most massive core in the region , h6 ( papers iv & v ) .",
    "large - scale kinematic studies revealed the presence of three filaments , filament 1 , ( 42.95@xmath40.17 ) ; filament 2 ( the main irdc filament ) , ( 45.63@xmath40.03 ) ; and filament 3 , ( 46.77@xmath40.06 )  ( paper iv ) . due to the high - angular resolution of this study ,",
    "it is evident that filament 2 can be resolved into two separate structures , f2a ( 45.34@xmath40.04 ) and f2b ( 46.00@xmath40.05 ) .",
    "in addition , the high - angular resolution pdbi map reveals that individual filaments can be both spectrally , and spatially resolved ( see section[section : int ] ) .",
    "figure[figure : bundles ] highlights the `` spine '' , i.e. the peak intensity for each filamentary structure identified in the pdbi data ( as derived from the fitting routine outlined in appendix[app : filamentfinder ] ) .",
    "this image has been generated by calculating an intensity - weighted offset right - ascension for every offset declination .",
    "the decomposition of  into multiple velocity components bears striking resemblance to the intricate filamentary structure observed in the l1495/b213 complex in taurus identified by @xcite . in l1495/b213 , a total of 35 structures",
    "have been identified .",
    "in addition , these filaments can be grouped into several `` bundles '' based on their chemical and kinematic properties .",
    "@xcite suggest a possible hierarchical route of fragmentation from cloud@xmath19bundles@xmath19filaments@xmath19cores . in the case of ,",
    "given the discussion posed in section[section : gas_dynamics ] , it is interesting to ask the question , ` _ _ are the observed filaments part of the initial conditions of star formation , or are they a consequence of projection effects , and/or protostellar feedback _ _ ? '",
    "previous single - dish studies , papers iv and v , noted the presence of a large - scale ( @xmath2 23pc ) velocity gradient , with paper v suggesting several plausible reasons for its origin .",
    "one scenario involves global accretion of material onto h6 , along filament 2 . in this scenario , estimating a mass accretion rate gives a value of the order 5@xmath510@xmath104yr@xmath7 , two orders of magnitude greater than the mass accretion rate estimated towards cluster forming regions in the serpens molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that f2a and f2b actually represent a change in velocity ( i.e. from low - to - high velocity ) , but are in fact still part of the same parent structure ( filament 2 ) . this `` jump '' in velocity would be similar to the velocity structure of collapsing filaments generated in numerical simulations of colliding flows by @xcite .",
    "however , in order to simultaneously observe two spectral velocity components ( as opposed to a single component that exhibits an abrupt change in velocity at the location of star formation ; @xcite ) over a large spatial extent ( as is observed in ; see figure[figure : bundles ] ) , the filament would have to be aligned close to the line of sight . whilst this can not be ruled out ,",
    "is extended over several parsecs in the plane of the sky , and therefore this seems unlikely",
    ".    an alternative scenario would be that f2a and f2b may represent the _ radial _ collapse of the filaments .",
    "this would explain why two spectral features are observed over a large spatial extent .",
    "in this scenario , f2a and f2b would represent the front and back of an inclined , radially collapsing filament . by inference therefore , this would mean that the  is depleted at intermediate velocities ( as the optical depth of the isolated components is typically @xmath118 , as seen in section[section : thin ] ) .",
    "although depletion of  has been observed towards low - mass starless cores ( e.g. @xcite ) , the observed abundance decrease is typically only limited to a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , it is clear from figure[figure : ii_ext ] that the observed integrated  emission rises with increasing mass surface density , suggestive of optically thin conditions and negligible depletion .",
    "the pdbi data therefore imply that the global north - south velocity gradient observed in single - dish data may , in fact , be explained by the presence of substructure within `` filament 2 '' ( i.e. f2a and f2b ) , and that this gradient does not transcend to smaller scales .",
    "the pdbi data indicates that the gas motions are dominated by _",
    "velocity gradients of the order @xmath21.52.5 , whereas global velocity gradients , and those observed in the north  south direction are smaller by comparison ( @xmath20.7 , and @xmath30.3 , respectively ; see section[section : gradients ] ) .",
    "given that the filaments are resolved spectrally , have differing velocity patterns , and ( in the case of f2a / f2b and f3 ) are resolved spatially ( c.f .",
    "figure[figure : chan ] ) , we identify them as independent structures .    away from h6 , in the very south of f2a ( @xmath34@xmath3 - 50 ) and in the north of f2b ( @xmath34@xmath840 ) , uniform gradients in the east@xmath19west direction are observed .",
    "in addition , the velocity pattern observed in f2a at offset ( 8,-30 ) indicates that velocity increases towards the centre of the filament ( see also figure[figure : ii ] ) .",
    "this interesting feature is spatially coincident with a localised increase in the velocity dispersion ( see figure[figure : dv ] ) .",
    "gradients such as these do not seem to be associated with any specific continuum peak .",
    "thus , it is possible that these gradients may represent global motion of the filaments , rather than those related to the early stages of star formation ( this is explored further in appendix[section : pv ] , using position - velocity analysis ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions observed in this study are _ mildly _ supersonic .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion ( as calculated from the gaussian fitting routine ) across all three filaments is @xmath20.33 . whilst the derived supersonic line - widths are in contrast to low - mass star forming filaments ( e.g. @xcite , who find @xmath119/@xmath36@xmath20.61@xmath40.17 , using  towards the l1495/b213 ) , they are narrower than those observed towards other irdcs .",
    "@xcite find that broad  line - widths are correlated with the star formation activity of clumps .",
    "they find line - widths in the range 1.64.6  ( corresponding to dispersions of @xmath20.72.0 ) .",
    "higher - spectral resolution studies are needed to verify results such as these in regions where a broad velocity dispersion may be explained by presence of unresolved spectral features . in regions",
    "where multiple spectral features are evident , moment analysis misleadingly indicates a larger dispersion than that of the individual components ( by a factor of @xmath22 ; see figure[figure : ii ] , and the spectrum at offset=-4.24,10.77 in figure[figure : exam_spec ] , for example ) .",
    "gaussian decomposition of the spectra is therefore a _ necessity _ in establishing the velocity dispersion of _ individual _ filaments .",
    "the left hand panels of figure[figure : sigmant ] show how the non - thermal velocity dispersion of each individual filament changes with respect to the main beam brightness temperature at all positions in the cloud . in paper iii , the total velocity dispersion derived from the  ( ) was identified to decrease towards the central , and dense portion of . similarly , in paper",
    "v , the relationship between the non - thermal dispersion and t@xmath120 was studied for co isotopologues ,  ( ) ,  ( ) , and  ( ) . in all cases",
    "@xmath67 was shown to increase with decreasing t@xmath120 with a power law trend .",
    "the dependency of @xmath67 on t@xmath120 was also shown to decrease with increasingly dense molecular tracers . in figure[figure : sigmant ] , a similar trend for filaments f2a and f2b is found , in that there is an overall decrease of the non - thermal component with increasing brightness . in @xcite ,",
    "studying star formation in the b5 region of perseus , intensity ( in this case antenna temperature ) is used as a proxy for density .",
    "the trend of decreasing turbulent motion with increasing intensity therefore represents a `` transition to coherence '' within close proximity to the location of star forming cores .",
    "in contrast to filaments f2a and f2b however , turbulent motion actually increases towards h6 in filament f3 . this is evident in the central , and right - hand panels of figure[figure : sigmant ] . here , the relationship between @xmath67 , offset declination ( central panels ) , and offset right ascension ( right - hand panels ) is plotted for each filamentary structure in . in the central and right - hand panels of f3 ,",
    "it is evident that the broadest lines , and therefore the lines with the greatest non - thermal component , are spatially coincident with h6 . in low - mass star - forming regions ,",
    "pre - stellar cores show slight ( @xmath260% ) line broadening towards their centres , due to the infall of material @xcite . in",
    ", this peak is not directly coincident with the sw continuum core discussed in section[section : gas_dynamics ] . instead , the peak in the non - thermal velocity dispersion is coincident with a starless core to the north of here ( see figure[figure : dv ] ) .",
    "higher - angular resolution observations of higher - density tracers are needed in order to understand the behaviour of star forming _ cores _ in relation to the surrounding dense filamentary material .",
    "we have presented a detailed kinematic study using high - sensitivity and high - spectral resolution pdbi observations of  ( 1 - 0 ) towards a highly - filamentary irdc .",
    "our results and analysis lead us to conclude the following :    1 .",
    "multiple filaments are identified both spectrally and spatially .",
    "f2a , f2b , and f3 have mean centroid velocities of ( 45.34@xmath40.04 ) , ( 46.00@xmath40.05 ) , ( 46.86@xmath40.04 ) , respectively .",
    "the abrupt change in velocity noted at the location of h6 ( papers iv & v ) , rather than being indicative of large scale flows towards h6 , may be explained by the presence of substructure within filament 2 , i.e. f2a and f2b .",
    "f2a , f2b , and f3 have mean line - widths ( fwhm ) of ( 0.83@xmath40.04 ) , ( 0.77@xmath40.04 ) , and ( 0.71@xmath40.04 ) , respectively . the ratio of non - thermal to thermal ( for ) velocity dispersion for each velocity component is 5.4 , 5.0 , and 4.7 , respectively .",
    "the ratio of the non - thermal component of the line - width to the isothermal sound speed for an average molecule ( mass = 2.33a.m.u . ) at 15k are 1.6 , 1.4 , and 1.4 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the gas motions are _ mildly _ supersonic . in regions",
    "where multiple spectral components are evident , moment analysis can overestimate the non - thermal contribution to the line - width by a factor @xmath1212 .",
    "4 .   globally , the kinematics of the gas are relatively quiescent , indicated by the small velocity gradients observed over each filament ( of the order @xmath30.7 ) . locally , however , the mean velocity gradients can reach @xmath2 1.52.5 . 5 .",
    "there is some indication that the kinematics of the dense gas may be influenced by the self - gravity of dense cores within filaments , or possibly by outflow feedback from already forming stars .",
    "further molecular line observations are required to discern between these two scenarios .",
    "for these two opposing scenarios we calculate : 1 .",

    "this indicates that the isolated components are _ partially _ optically thick towards the h6 region .",
    "however , given the relatively small optical depth values , the corresponding correction factors would also be small .",

    "is then calculated .",
    "following similar analysis to @xcite , who investigated rotation in the horsehead nebula , a linear fit is calculated ( under the assumption of solid body rotation ) for each box using the intensity weighted position versus velocity .",
    "the mean magnitude of this gradient is ( -13.9@xmath42.0 ) . in the analysis of @xcite , the authors favour an interpretation of rotation rather than shear motion whilst studying the horsehead nebula . in the case of , this may be indicative of shear motions between filaments .",
    "such shear motions have been discussed in relation to the formation of massive dense cores in dr21(oh ) by @xcite , who report velocity shears of 23 .",
    "however , due to the relatively small angular separation of the two filaments , and considering the uncertainties that arise due to projection effects , this result is approached with caution .",
    "in this paper a semi - automated fitting routine has been used to identify multiple gaussian components with spectra .",
    "the routine consists of two main components : a gaussian fitting procedure , and a classification routine that identifies and groups components . in the next two sections",
    "the step - by - step methodology from fitting to classification is described .      1 .",
    "firstly , a coverage is defined .",
    "the user is asked to provide a radius and spacing .",
    "this refers to a radius of a circle , within which the routine will compute an average spectrum from all spectra contained within this limit .",
    "the spacing refers to the placement of these preliminary areas .",
    "specifically , it is an integer number of pixels , starting at the first position in the map .",
    "the radius and spacing number should be selected such that a complete coverage of the map is achieved .",
    "the radius should be large enough to sufficiently reduce user input , but small enough to avoid diluting the main features within the spectra .",
    "for this particular data set , a radius of 6 , with a spacing of 5.91  ( i.e. 1.5@xmath5pixels ) , was used .",
    "this provided full coverage with 175 preliminary areas .",
    "2 .   for each area ,",
    "all spectra contained within the confining radius are averaged .",
    "the user then defines how many gaussian components to fit to each average spectrum , and to provide initial estimates for the intensity , velocity , and line - width of each component .",
    "a minimisation algorithm , mpfitfun @xcite , is used to find best fit results for the single or multiple gaussian components , displaying the result to the screen .",
    "the mpfitfun fit results are then used as initial ( free - parameter ) estimates for each individual spectrum contained within the preliminary area .",
    "the cycle is complete when no more preliminary areas remain .",
    "the fitting routine allows the user to fit up to three gaussian components at a time . in doing so , the routine outputs the following parameters for each individual gaussian component : ra , dec , line intensity ( with uncertainty ) , centroid velocity ( with uncertainty ) , fwhm ( with uncertainty ) , base rms , @xmath125 , residual value .",
    "the base rms is calculated within a user defined velocity range .",
    "the @xmath125 and residual values are derived from the output parameters of mpfitfun . in order for the routine to identify multiple velocity components , it must satisfy a number of constraints :    1 .",
    "the spectrum must contain a velocity channel with a measured intensity greater than a user defined intensity threshold ( based on the rms ) .",
    "all positions that do not contain a velocity channel with intensity greater than this threshold are discarded .",
    "the fwhm of all gaussian components must be broader than the velocity resolution ( @xmath126@xmath127 ) .",
    "although simplistic , in very rare occasions the minimisation algorithm can converge on a non - physical solution - typically an extremely narrow ( fwhm @xmath128@xmath126@xmath127 ) , and bright velocity component .",
    "these solutions are discarded by the program , and the spectra refit .",
    "3 .   the separation in centroid velocity between two peaks must be greater than the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the brightest component defined by the average spectrum .",
    "this is to prevent the minimisation algorithm converging towards a two component fit , when the spectrum only shows a single peak .",
    "4 .   the centroid velocity of each gaussian component in individual spectra must lie within a velocity range defined by v@xmath129fwhm@xmath130 @xmath3 v@xmath131 @xmath3 v@xmath129+fwhm@xmath130 , where fwhm@xmath130 refers to the fwhm of the _ same component _ identified in the average spectrum .",
    "this ensures that the same velocity component is fitted in each spectrum , whilst also allowing for velocity gradients on a spectrum - to - spectrum basis .",
    "if the above conditions are not satisfied , the program will aim to fit a lower amount of velocity components , repeating the above checks until they are satisfied .",
    "once satisfied , in order to be verified as a fit , the residual value of the resultant fit must be less than 3@xmath28 .",
    "due to the preliminary areas having some level of overlap with neighbouring areas , there are typically multiple fits to the same position . in order to select the `` best fit '' to the spectrum",
    ", the fit with the lowest @xmath125 is therefore chosen .",
    "to group velocity components , the map is divided into boxes .",
    "each box has an area of @xmath212@xmath512  ( the equivalent area would contain 9synthesised pdbi beams ) .",
    "next , the box with the greatest total integrated intensity is identified .",
    "velocity component classification begins within this box using the following procedure :    1 .   from the data - set containing the gaussian fits ,",
    "the position within the box with the greatest integrated intensity is selected : this is the `` seed '' position .",
    "it is identified whether or not this position has multiple velocity components associated with it . the first velocity component is selected.[al : seed ] 2 .   the angular distance to every position within the area is calculated using : @xmath132 ( see step[al : grad ] for `` branch '' explanation ) .",
    "[ al : dist ] 3 .",
    "all positions within a radius equivalent to the maximum distance between two adjacent points in the grid are selected . for the pdbi map",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath133@xmath22.75  or @xmath2 0.04pc at a distance of 2900pc .",
    "[ al : locate ] 4 .",
    "each of these positions is then cycled through , calculating the velocity gradient between each spectral component , and the velocity component of the seed position (  @xmath134 @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the velocity component of the selected position , @xmath137 is the velocity component of the seed ( branch ) position , and @xmath138 is the angular distance defined in step[al : dist ] ) .",
    "if the velocity gradient is @xmath139 2  ( which corresponds to a velocity difference of 0.08  over a distance of 0.04pc ) then accept these components as linked . if linked , this position is registered as a new `` branch '' location .",
    "[ al : grad ] 5 .",
    "fit components that have then been classified as linked , are then removed from the data set .",
    "this ensures no component will be linked twice .",
    "[ al : rem ] 6 .",
    "each _ branch _ location is now cycled through , repeating steps [ al : dist][al : rem ] .",
    "however , rather than using the seed velocity , the branch velocity is used .",
    "[ al : branch ] 7 .",
    "once no more branch locations can be attributed to the original seed , the next seed velocity component is selected and steps [ al : dist][al : rem ] are repeated 8 .",
    "this continues until all velocity components from the seed have been exhausted .",
    "[ al : cont ] 9 .",
    "steps [ al : seed][al : cont ] are repeated until all seed locations have then been exhausted .",
    "this method groups gaussian components that are _ closely _ linked in velocity ( the initial linking gradient is @xmath2half of the velocity resolution in the case of the pdbi data ) .",
    "therefore , this method leaves a number of points that do not meet the criteria outlined in step [ al : grad ] above . in order to group",
    "the unassigned data , angular distance from the brightest position in the cloud versus @xmath30 is plotted for every gaussian component within the area .",
    "easily distinguished are the velocity components that have been fitted according to the method outlined above .",
    "the remaining unassigned data points were then linked to the group that is closest in velocity .",
    "if this presented an ambiguous result , for example in a box where two components converge into a single gaussian fit , with no obvious asymmetry , then the data point remains unassigned .",
    "this analysis is repeated for each box in the mapped area .    at this point ,",
    "all boxes are _ independent _ from the surrounding areas . in order to link velocity components between boxes ,",
    "the brightest box is selected first , and the eight contiguous boxes are arranged in order of descending _ total _ integrated intensity . by linking boxes that are directly adjacent to one another the risk of linking different velocity components is minimised ( maximum distance between two points in adjacent boxes @xmath2 34 ; or @xmath2 0.5pc at a distance of 2900pc ) .",
    "finally , once the procedure is complete , individual positions are checked by hand to see whether or not a different number of velocity components would better represent the data .",
    "table[table : stats ] highlights some statistics on the fitting procedure . out of 1554 positions in the mapped region , a total of 1117 have been fitted with a total of 1700 gaussian components .",
    "this highlights the degree of multiplicity in the cloud and the complexity of the spectra . following the above procedures , @xmath29% of the positions",
    "were refitted by hand .",
    "the majority of components have been attributed to filaments f2a , f2b , and f3 , with contributions from additional components at various positions in the cloud ( c4 , c5 , and c6 are identified as individual components , but can not be linked to either each other or f2a , f2b , and f3 , due to separation in either velocity or position ) . in total @xmath2 6% of the fits",
