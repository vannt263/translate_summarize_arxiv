    "the discovery of multiple stellar populations in the most massive gc ( @xcite ) , together with the fact that the second most massive gc is a core of the disrupting sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ) , have strengthen the view that some of the massive gcs might be remaining cores of disrupted nucleated dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) . among their several peculiar characteristics , both @xmath1cen and m54 have extended horizontal - branch ( ehb ) , with extremely hot horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars well separated from redder hb ( @xcite ; rosenberg , recio - blanco , @xmath2 garcia - marin 2004 ) .",
    "high precision @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) photometry ( @xcite ) has discovered that @xmath1cen also has a curious double main - sequence ( ms ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that both these peculiar colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) characteristics are best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced second generation subpopulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the prediction of the models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that most of the gcs with ehb would have double or broadened mss are now confirmed by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ) photometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "this ensures that ehbs are strong signature of the presence of multiple populations in gcs .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath1230@xmath0 ) of the helium enriched subpopulation observed in these peculiar gcs is also best explained if the second generation stars were formed from enriched gas trapped in the deep gravitational potential well while these gcs were cores of the ancient dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) . despite the lack of apparently wide spread in iron - peak elements in most of these gcs ,",
    "all of these recent developments suggest that gcs with ehb are probably not genuine gcs , but might have a unique origin in the formation history of the galaxy .    in order to test this working hypothesis",
    "further , we have carefully surveyed 114 gcs with reasonably good cmds , and found that 28 ( 25@xmath0 ) of them have ehb ( lee et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "their ngc numbers are : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and for the gcs with strongly extended hb ; and , , , , , , , , , , , , and for the gcs with moderately extended hb , including those with bimodal hb distributions . we will collectively call all of them as `` ehb gcs '' .",
    "our selection of ehb gcs were based on the reddening independent criteria on cmd in _ _ b__@xmath2_v _ passbands ( @xmath13@xmath14 @xmath15 3.5 for strongly extended hb ; either 3.0 @xmath16 @xmath13@xmath14 @xmath16 3.5 or @xmath13@xmath17 @xmath15 0.78 with clear bimodal colour distribution for moderately extended hb ) .",
    "but , since their appearances on cmds are distinct enough from gcs with normal hb ( @xcite ) , our selection agrees well with the result based on smaller sample and other measures of hb temperature extension ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have then investigated their properties compared to other normal gcs .",
    "first of all , from the luminosity function ( fig .",
    "1 ) , we found that ehb gcs are among the brightest gcs of the milky way , including 11 out of 12 brightest gcs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is surprising to see that not a single ehb gc is fainter than @xmath18 = -7 .",
    "careful inspection of all cmds confirms that this is not due to the smaller number of hb stars in fainter gcs . because of significant fraction ( 18 - 51@xmath0 ) of the helium enriched bluer subpopulation observed in ehb gcs , its presence on the hb",
    "would be reliably detected ( @xmath15 5 - 10 stars ) even in a cluster of @xmath18 = -6 or -5 if it existed .",
    "this result is perhaps already suggesting that ehb gcs might have a peculiar origin , as their inferred current stellar mass , which might represent only a small fraction of their original mass , is comparable with that of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies in the local group .    motivated by this",
    ", we have investigated the kinematics of ehb gcs , in order to see whether their kinematic properties are also distinct from other normal gcs . following previous investigation ( @xcite ) ,",
    "we have first divided gcs into three subgroups ( fig .",
    "2 ) based on the hb morphology and metallicity diagram ( lee , demarque , @xmath2 zinn 1994 ) .",
    "metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath16 -0.8 ) gcs in the `` old halo ( oh ) '' group have bluer hb morphology at a given metallicity , and those in the `` younger halo ( yh ) '' group have redder hb morphology at fixed metallicity .",
    "the oh group , in the mean , is probably older than the yh group by @xmath121 gyr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath15 -0.8 ) gcs are further classified as `` disk / bulge ( d / b ) '' group .",
    "ehb gcs belong in all three subgroups , although the majority of them are in the oh group .",
    "note also that most ( 94@xmath0 ) gcs in yh group are in the outer halo ( galactocentric distance , @xmath19 @xmath15 8 kpc ) , while the majority ( 80@xmath0 ) of gcs in oh and d / b groups are in the inner halo ( @xmath19 @xmath16 8 kpc ) .",

    "when all the gcs are considered , we are basically confirming the conclusion of the previous work ( @xcite ) .",
    "yh group is dominated by random motion with no sign of significant rotation ( @xmath20 ) , while oh group shows some prograde rotation and a smaller line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "d / b group is mostly supported by rotation with a relatively small @xmath21 .",
    "we find , however , ehb gcs , both belonging to yh and oh groups , are dominated by random motion and show no signs of rotation .",
    "consequently , when they are excluded from the sample , normal gcs in oh group show increased rotation ( from 1.5 to 1.8@xmath23 from zero @xmath20 ) and higher value of @xmath20/@xmath21 .",
    "the same trend is also observed in the normal gcs in d / b group , but with much larger uncertainty .",
    "when only comparably bright ( @xmath18 @xmath16 -6 ) gcs are considered , the differences become significantly larger ( 2.5@xmath23 from zero @xmath20 ) .",
    "the above analysis , based only on the radial velocity data , provides good reason to suspect that ehb gcs are kinematically decoupled from other normal gcs , especially in oh group .",
    "below , we investigate this in more detail using the measurements of full spatial motions and orbital parameters now available for 49 gcs in our sample ( @xcite ) .    in figure 3",
    ", we have plotted kinematic parameters obtained from full spatial motions as a function of metallicity , which shows more directly the systematic differences between ehb and normal gcs . in all panels of figure 3 ,",
    "ehb gcs have diversity in kinematics , and show no correlations with metallicity ( correlation coefficient , _ r _ , of -0.02 to -0.31 with high @xmath24-values of 0.25 to 0.94 ) .",
    "normal yh gcs , mostly in the outer halo , show kinematically hot signatures ( high @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath2 eccentricity , and large velocity dispersion ) ( @xcite ) . to our surprise , however , when ehb gcs are excluded , most normal gcs with prograde rotation in oh and d / b groups ( red filled circles ) show clear signs of dissipational collapse .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 velocity , and perhaps orbital eccentricity are all decreasing with increasing metallicity , among which the ` chevron ' shape of @xmath27 velocity distribution is most impressive .",
    "rotational velocity , however , is increasing with metallicity , and @xmath28 appears to be conserved .",
    "the orbital properties of are known to be highly affected by the potential of the bar because of its proximity ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , excluding this one deviant point in panels ( d ) and ( e ) , we obtain strong correlations for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and eccentricity ( _ r _",
    "= -0.58 , -0.71 , -0.95 , 0.89 , and -0.77 , respectively ) with small @xmath24-values ( 0.05 , 0.01 , 3.1@xmath31 @xmath32 , 0.0002 , and 0.005 , respectively ) . in other words ,",
    "the correlations are highly significant at the level of 95@xmath0 , 99@xmath0 , 99.999@xmath0 , 99.98@xmath0 , and 99.5@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "as expected , however , correlation is low ( _ r _ = 0.17 ) for @xmath28 with a high @xmath24-value of 0.59 .",
    "all of these trends observed for normal gcs with prograde rotation in oh and d / b groups are fully consistent with the model first envisioned by eggen , lynden - bell , @xmath2 sandage ( 1962 ) , where metal enrichment went on as dissipational collapse continued .",
    "although these results are based on relatively modest numbers of gcs with full spatial motion information , their coherent behaviours in all panels of figure 3 , together with statistically significant correlations , confirm that we are detecting real signatures .",
    "also , these results are consistent with the kinematics solution obtained from radial velocity alone ( table 1 ) , which is based on a larger sample of gcs .",
    "we argue , therefore , ( 1 ) ehb gcs in our sample are indeed kinematically decoupled from most of the normal gcs in oh group , and ( 2 ) when ehb gcs are excluded , we are detecting clearer signatures of dissipational collapse in the inner halo , which apparently led to the formation of the galactic disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the kinematics of ehb gcs , which are not following the dissipational collapse , are more consistent with what one would expect among the relicts of primeval star - forming subsystems that first formed the nucleus ( ehb gcs with low @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and halo ( ehb gcs with high @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) of the galaxy through both dissipational and dissipationless mergers , as has been predicted by recent @xmath33cdm simulations for `` high-@xmath23 peaks '' ( e.g. , diemand , madau , @xmath2 moore 2005 ; @xcite ) . as described above , a significant fraction of the helium enriched subpopulation also favours building block origin of ehb gcs .",
    "normal yh gcs in the outer halo share their kinematic properties with the outlying ehb gcs , which is consistent with the view ( @xcite ) that they were originally formed in the outskirts of isolated building blocks and later accreted to the outer halo of the galaxy when their parent dwarf galaxies , like the sagittarius , were merging with the milky way .",
    "the gcs with ehb also tend to show more extended na - o and mg - al anticorrelations ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the suggested connection between some of these gcs with strong chemical inhomogenity and orbital parameters ( @xcite ) might be due to the diversity of kinematics among ehb gcs .    according to the present picture ,",
    "most of the normal gcs with retrograde rotation in oh and d / b groups could have also originated from the subsystems with retrograde rotation .",
    "interestingly , their relatively confined distributions both in the angular momentum phase space ( @xcite ) and velocity space are not inconsistent with the possibility that some or most of them were former members of parent dwarf galaxies hosting two ehb gcs , and/or ( lee et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "their distribution in velocity space is also well consistent with the model prediction of the tidal debris from @xmath1cen s parent dwarf system ( mizutani , chiba , @xmath2 sakamoto 2003 ) , which was presumably formed in the outer halo and accreted to the inner halo .",
    "note that a similar minor merging of subsystem with the thin disk ( quinn , hernquist , @xmath2 fullagar 1993 ) could have also changed some of the original kinematic properties of two disk gcs in figure 3 ( and ) .",
    "the clear differences in kinematics and mass between gcs with and without ehb are strong evidence that they have different origins .",
    "our results suggest present - day galactic gcs are most likely an ensemble of heterogeneous objects originated from three distinct phases of the milky way formation : ( 1 ) remaining cores or central star clusters of building blocks that first assembled to form the nucleus and halo of the proto - galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 2 ) genuine gcs formed in the dissipational collapse of a transient gas - rich inner halo system that eventually formed the galactic disk ( @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) genuine gcs formed in the outskirts of outlying building blocks that later accreted to the outer halo of the milky way ( @xcite ) . in this picture ,",
    "relicts of first building blocks that formed the flattened nucleus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are now observed as relatively metal - poor ehb gcs ( e.g. , ngc , , and ) having low @xmath25 and @xmath26 near the centre .",
    "formation of the slowly - rotating gas - rich inner halo system that later collapsed in phase ( 2 ) is still most unclear , but it is attractive to speculate that leftover gas from `` rare peaks '' ( building blocks hosting ehb gcs ) in the inner halo and gas from continuously falling `` less rare peaks '' ( @xcite ) led to the formation of this structure , perhaps with the aids of some heating feedbacks ( e.g. , @xcite ) soon followed by cooling .",
    "several lines of further study will certainly help to shed more light into the picture briefly sketched here .",
    "for example , search for the tidal streams that might be associated with ehb gcs , dark matter search in the outlying ehb gcs where preferential disruption of dark matter halo ( @xcite ) might be less severe , kinematics analyses of extragalactic gc systems along with the ultraviolet survey for ehb gc candidates , together with more detailed high resolution @xmath33cdm simulations .",
