    "calculating percolation thresholds has been an ongoing challenge for decades @xcite .",
    "while very few lattices allow an exact analytical calculation , large scale simulations have been very valuable to determine a large spectrum of them for both bravais @xcite and disordered @xcite lattices .",
    "the drastic increase in computer capacities has recently permitted the calculation of thresholds at rather high dimensions up to @xmath8 for the hypercube @xcite . in parallel",
    ", not much work has been devoted to regular lattices with neighbor interactions which are not nearest neighbors ( n@xmath0 , von neumann s neighborhood ) .",
    "some scarce results are available for simultaneous nearest and next nearest neighbors ( n@xmath0+n@xmath1 , moore s neighborhood ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report for the first time a systematic calculation of site percolation thresholds for the square lattice with neighbor interactions at successive increasing range .",
    "we consider the series of nearest neighbors ( n@xmath0 ) , next nearest neighbors ( n@xmath1 ) , next next nearest neighbors ( n@xmath2 ) , fourth nearest neighbors ( n@xmath5 ) and fifth nearest neighbors ( n@xmath3 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that for each one of the considered distance of interaction , all others are not active .",
    "for instance in the case of next nearest neighbors ( n@xmath1 ) , the nearest neighbors ( n@xmath0 ) sites are not connected , only the n@xmath1 are .",
    "this principle applies to all our calculations .",
    "we found that the threshold is the same for all of them with @xmath9 except at n@xmath5 .",
    "an explanation in terms of symmetry is provided .",
    "we then consider combinations of various ranges of interactions with ( n@xmath0+n@xmath1 ) , ( n@xmath0+n@xmath2 ) , ( n@xmath0+n@xmath5 ) and ( n@xmath0+n@xmath1+n@xmath2 ) . in these cases",
    "we have simultaneous range of interactions but they are necessary compact .",
    "for instance for ( n@xmath0+n@xmath2 ) all nearest neighbors sites are connected as well as all next next nearest neighbor ones but next nearest neighbors are not interacting .    comparing our numerical estimates with the predictions from the galam ",
    "mauger ( gm ) universal formula for percolation thresholds @xcite , we found significant discrepancies .",
    "it strengthens the earlier claim that only dimension and coordination number could not be sufficient to build a universal law which extends to complex lattices @xcite .",
    "there exist several computational techniques which allow to perform calculations of percolation thresholds @xcite . here",
    "we are using the hoshen  kopelman algorithm ( hka ) @xcite .",
    "once the lattice is given with the occupied sites , it allows to recognize which sites belong to which clusters . with hka one can assign to each occupied site a label and sites in the same cluster have the same labels .",
    "different labels are assigned to different clusters .",
    "the hka is particularly efficient when we check if the site at distance @xmath10 from the first line  often fully occupied  is still connected to that line through the sites at the distances smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "the algorithm requires storing only single line of sites and goes through the lattice only once .",
    "in such a case hka becomes extremely efficient as it saves memory and time @xcite .",
    "however , when links between sites at distances larger than @xmath10 from a top border are desired , the whole lattice must be stored @xcite . with the hka on a square lattice when we assign the labels for the investigated site ( black sites in fig .",
