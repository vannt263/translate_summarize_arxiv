    "recent observational data of the universe have substantially tightened our grip on the cosmological model and its fundamental parameters .",
    "most prominent of these data are maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , in particular those measured by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) satellite ( e.g. spergel 2003 ) , the 2df and sdss galaxy redshift surveys ( percival 2002 ; zehavi 2002 ) , and the ly@xmath1 forest seen in spectra of quasars ( qsos ) ( croft 1999 , 2002 ; mcdonald 2000 & 2004 , nusser & haehnelt 1999 , 2000 ; kim 2004 ; viel , weller & haehnelt 2004 ) . despite the remarkable recent achievements ,",
    "our understanding of the initial stages of the formation of structure remains poor .",
    "the weakest link is the era of hydrogen re - ionization at high redshifts .",
    "the wmap polarization measurement ( e.g. spergel 2003 ) imply a universe that must have been ionized at redshifts @xmath8 . however , the imprinted signal of re - ionization in the cmb is insensitive to the details of the initial stages .",
    "a probe of these details can be found in  absorption features in spectra of high redshift qso .",
    "these features can reveal the spatial distribution of ionized regions as a function of redshift ( becker 2001 , fan 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , bright qsos are hard to detect at high redshifts and , also , the inference of constraints on the three - dimensional structure of re - ionization can be very tricky ( e.g. nusser 2002 ) .",
    "a more promising probe of reionization , especially of the initial stages , is observations of the redshifted 21-cm emission / absorption lines produced by  in the high redshift universe ( field 1959 , sunyaev & zeldovich 1975 , hogan & rees 1979 , subramanian & padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "the 21-cm line is produced in the transition between the triplet and singlet sublevels of the hyperfinestructure of the ground level of neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "this wavelength corresponds to a frequency of 1420mhz and a temperature of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the populations of the triplet and singlet ground state of hi atoms then the spin temperature is defined by @xmath12 .",
    "the cmb radiation tends to bring @xmath13 to its own temperature of @xmath14 ( mather 1994 ) .",
    "an  region would be visible against the cmb either in absorption if @xmath15 or emission if @xmath16 .",
    "two mechanisms for decoupling the spin and cmb temperature have been proposed ( field 1958 ) .",
    "the first is the wouthuysen - field process ( wouthuysen 1952 , field 1958 ) which is also termed `` ly@xmath1 pumping '' . in this process",
    "the hyperfine sublevels are interchanged by the absorption and emission of a ly@xmath1 photon .",
    "the final product of this process is a spin temperature that equals the `` color '' temperature of the ly@xmath1 photons .",
    "the color temperature eventually approaches the thermal temperature of the gas as a result of recoil effects by repeated scattering off the  atoms ( field 1959 ) .",
    "the other mechanism is spin exchange by means collisions of atoms with free electrons and other atoms . both of these effects work towards bringing the spin temperature close to the gas thermal temperature , leading to @xmath17 .",
    "however , this decoupling is just a transient as very rapidly the cmb radiation field brings @xmath13 to finite values . ] . the efficiency of ly@xmath1 pumping has been studied thoroughly by several authors ( scott & rees 1990 , madau , meiksen & rees 1997 , ciardi & madau 2003 , tozzi 2000 , chen & miralda - escud 2004 ) . for reionization by stars alone",
    "the ly@xmath1 pumping is believed to be very efficient even when the volume filling factor of ionized regions is less than a few per cents .",
    "the reasoning behind that is as follows . during the early stages of reioinization",
    "all uv photons emitted with @xmath18 by a stellar source are consumed in ionizing the surrounding gas ( mainly ) .",
    "a ly@xmath1 continuum photon with @xmath19 is free to travel until it is redshifted to a @xmath20 where it is captured in the ly@xmath1 line of a ground state  atom .",
    "such a photon travels a comoving distance of @xmath21 ( about 350@xmath22 at @xmath23 for @xmath24 ev ) before its capture .",
    "since a star emits at least 4 times more photons in the ly@xmath1 continuum than in the uv ( e.g. ciardi & madau 2003 ) ) , one expects a significant amount of the continuum photons to reach the  far beyond ionized regions . according to ciardi & madau ( 2003 ) ly@xmath1 pumping",
    "should already have become efficient when the volume filling factor of ionized regions is as small as a few per cent .",
    "this conclusion is invalid when the ionizing sources are highly clustered .",
    "the ly@xmath1 continuum from an aggregation of sources could decouple the spin - cmb temperature in a sphere of maximum radius of @xmath25 around it , independent of the number of ly@xmath1 continuum photons emitted by these sources .",
    "however , the ionized region around this aggregation is proportional to the number of sources in it .",
    "further , x - ray photons from accreting black holes could easily have played an important role in an early re - ionization epoch ( e.g. ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) . because of the large uncertainties in describing reionization ( c.f .",
    "cen 2003 , wyithe & loeb 2003 ) it is prudent to examine in detail the consequences of other mechanisms for decoupling the spin - cmb temperatures .    in the absence of free electrons , spin exchange by  atom - atom collisions is important only in regions with high density contrasts , @xmath26^{-2}$ ] ( e.g. ciardi & madau 2003 ) .",
    "this condition is satisfied in minihalos with @xmath27 which could contain a significant fraction of  at @xmath28 ( iliev 2003 ) in the absence of external heating sources . in this paper",
    "we argue that collisions of  atoms with free electrons and other atoms in moderate density regions with 70 - 90 per cent neutral fraction can induce significant 21-cm emission against the cmb . as an example of this we focus on pre - reionization ( i.e. early stages of reionization ) by x - ray photons ( oh 2001 , venkatesan , giroux & shull 2001 , machacek , bryan & abel 2003 , ostriker & gnedin 1996 , ricotti & ostriker 2004 , ricotti , ostriker & gnedin 2004 ) .",
    "x - ray photons have such a small cross section for  ionization so that they rapidly form a uniform ionizing background ( e.g. ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) . the average ionized fraction in the presence of this background",
    "is in the range 5 - 20 per cent for @xmath29 , which is consistent with the current constraints on the observed soft x - ray background ( dijkstra 2004 ) . under these circumstances , collisions are very efficient at decoupling the spin - cmb temparetures .",
    "we develop a simple semi - analytic model to estimates the 21-cm emission fluctuations induced by spin - cmb decoupling by means of collisions in the framework of the x - ray scenario .",
    "we also consider 21-cm emission during the recombination of `` bubbles '' ionized by sporadic short - lived sources of uv ionizing radiation .",
    "gas in a newly formed ionized bubble would have a temperature of a few @xmath30 and would immediately start cooling ( mainly by compton cooling ) and recombining into .",
    "electron - atom collisions inside the bubble maintain the recombined  at @xmath31 .",
    "this high @xmath13 amounts to a significant 21-cm emission against the cmb when the  fraction is the range @xmath32 per cent .",
    "this emission could last for @xmath33 so that repetitive formation of these bubbles could yield an appreciable signal .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we summarize the basic equations . in ",
    "3 we present results for the 21-cm differential brightness temperature at mean gas density as a function of temperature , the  fraction , and redshift . the temperature fluctuations are estimated numerically in  4 . with the exception of subsection 4.3 ,",
    "all of  4 is devoted to the role of collisions in the x - ray pre - reionization scenario .",
    "we discuss the results and conclude in  5 .",
    "we assume throughout that spin exchange by means of collisions is the dominant mechanism for decoupling the spin temperature from the cmb . in this case",
    "the spin temperature is given by ( field 1959 ) , @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 denoting the total de - excitation rate as a result of collisions with free electrons and other atoms .",
    "following field ( 1959 ) , we write @xmath37 in the following we adopt the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 listed in table 2 of field ( 1958 ) .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath36 are in good agreement with other published data for the relevant temperature range considered here ( allison & dalgarno 1969 ) . at @xmath40 and @xmath30",

    "the _ differential brightness temperature _ ( hereafter , dbt ) against the cmb of a small patch of gas with @xmath13 at redshift @xmath45 is ( e.g. ciardi & madau 2003 ) , @xmath46^{{1/2}}\\ ; .",

    "it is insensitive to @xmath53 above 3000k , but varies appreciably as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath56 there is an increase by a nearly factor of @xmath57 between @xmath58 and 0.7 .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] we examine the spin temperature , @xmath13 , as a function of the neutral fraction , @xmath52 .",

    "the middle and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] show @xmath49 as a function of @xmath52 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . here also we see that a small free electron fraction can substantially boost up @xmath49 . for @xmath63 collisions with free electrons",
    "become less effective at decoupling @xmath13 from @xmath64 , making @xmath65 ( see eq .",

    "note that the @xmath49 curves peak at @xmath67 , close to the values expected in the x - ray pre - reionization scenario ( ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] we show the redshift evolution of @xmath49 at @xmath50 for @xmath66 and 0.9 , as indicated in the figure . in a realistic scenario for x - ray pre - reionization @xmath52 varies with redshift ( ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) . the history of x - ray pre - ionization , if indeed happened , could in principle be probed by observations of the mean temperature as a function of observed frequency , @xmath68 . in practice",
    ", this signal maybe overwhelmed by foreground source ( shaver 1999 ; baltz , gnedin & silk 1998 , ricotti , ostriker & gnedin 2004 ) .",
    "as a concrete example for assessing the role of collisions we consider the dbt in the x - ray pre - reionization scenario ( oh 2001 , venkatesan , giroux & shull 2001 , machacek , bryan & abel 2003 , ostriker & gnedin 1996 , ricotti & ostriker 2004 , ricotti , ostriker & gnedin 2004 ) . the mean free path of x - ray photons is much larger than the correlation length of the sources and their mean separation .",
    "therefore , in this scenario x - ray photons act as a uniform ionizing background and the  fraction , @xmath52 , at a point with density contrast , @xmath47 , is determined by the equation for photoionization equilibrium , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the x - ray photoionization rate per hydrogen atom , @xmath71 is the recombination cross section to the second excited atomic level , and @xmath72 is the mean density of total ( ionized plus neutral ) hydrogen . according to ricotti & ostriker ( 2004 ) , the mean  fraction should be maintained at a level @xmath73 starting from redshifts @xmath74 in order to match the wmap value of @xmath75 for optical depth to thomson scattering ( spergel 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , here we fix the ration @xmath76 by assuming that @xmath52 is given at mean density , i.e. at @xmath77 then @xmath52 for any @xmath47 can be easily found using ( [ photo ] ) .",
    "the dbt fluctuations over the sky and as a function of frequency contain significant cosmological information . in the case of the x - ray scenario ,",
    "these fluctuations are a direct probe of the density fluctuations during the pre - reionization period since , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : tb_delta ] , the dbt is an increasing function of the local density . in the following",
    "we make an attempt at assessing the statistical properties of these fluctuations .",
    "ideally one would like to have a suite of hydro simulations combined with radiative transfer in order to compute the ionized fraction as a function of redshift and position for a given cosmological model ( e.g. gnedin & shaver 2004 , ricotti , ostriker & gnedin 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , current simulations of this type are limited to small boxes ( @xmath78 ) making them unsuitable for detailed statistical analyses .",

    "we will present results for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "these values are inferred from the non - linear power spectrum of the @xmath97 computed from the linear power spectrum using the recipe outlined in peacock ( 1999 ) .",

    "are clearly seen for @xmath119 khz .",
    "there are clear differences also between the contour maps for @xmath114 ( panels to the right ) and for @xmath66 .",

    "we have focused on 21-cm emission induced by collisions during a pre - reionization period in which x - rays are the main source of ionizing photons .",
    "an alternative scenario would be pre - reionization by uv radiation produced by short - lived sources ( of lifetime much shorter than the recombination time - scale ) .    in this scenario",

    "further , it has become clear that the prospects for measuring the 21-cm signal are good in view of the various radio telescopes designed with this purpose in mind . despite foreground contaminations ( e.g. oh & mack 2003 , di matteo , ciardi & miniati 2004 , morales & hewitt 2004 , zaldarriaga , furlanetto & hernquist 2004 ) , the collective data obtained by telescopes like the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the primeval structure telescope ( past ) , the square kilometer array , and the t - rex instrument should , at the very least , help us discriminate among distinct reionization scenarios .    in some reionization scenarios , collisions of free electrons with  atoms",

    "a recombining bubble should show in 21-cm emission ( of @xmath128 ) for about @xmath130 .",
    "a thorough analysis of the collective emission from these bubbles is currently underway .    in order to compute the fluctuations in the x - ray scenario ,",
    "we have employed a simple semi - analytic model that allows us to assess the statistical properties of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations .",
    "the 21-cm fluctuations in this and other pre - reionization scenarios have been considered previously by several workers in the field ( bruscoli 2000 , benson 2001 , liu 2001 , iliev 2002 , ciardi & madau 2003 , bharadwaj & sk .",
    "saiyad 2004 , ricotti , ostriker & gnedin 2004 , zaldarriaga , furlanetto & hernquist 2004 ) .",
    "in particular ricotti , ostriker & gnedin ( 2004 ) used numerical simulations of a @xmath135 box to model various details of x - ray ionization scenarios .",
    "however , an assessment of the importance of collisions vs ly@xmath1 pumping as a function of position in the simulation remains to be done .",
    "further , the simulation box is still small and an analysis of the general statistical properties of the fluctuations must rely on semi - analytic models .",
    "we advocate here the the application of the alcock - paczyski ( ap ) test ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) on the correlations measured in three dimensional maps of 21-cm emission .",
    "these correlations are readily expressed in terms of angular separations and frequency intervals . in order to derive the correlations in terms of real space separations ( measured for example in @xmath22 )",
    "one needs to know the mean density parameter , @xmath136 , and the cosmological constant @xmath137 .",
    "constraints on these parameters can then be obtained by demanding isotropy of correlations in real space . a detailed analysis of the 21 cm ap test is presented elsewhere ( nusser 2004 ) .",
