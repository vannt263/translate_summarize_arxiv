    "computation of the properties of hadrons beginning from the qcd lagrangian is a major goal of lattice gauge theory , and steady progress has been made .",
    "the computational burden of including dynamical quarks is a major obstacle in the use of lattice qcd to compute hadronic properties . as a result",
    ", many quantities are much better determined in the quenched approximation than in full qcd .",
    "one way of studying the effects of dynamical quarks is to calculate in quenched and full qcd , using the same valence quark action in both cases , and matching the lattice spacings and physical sizes of the lattices , so that any differences that are found can convincingly be ascribed to the dynamical quarks . here",
    "we present a calculation of the hadron spectrum at a lattice spacing of about @xmath2 fm , using quenched and full qcd lattices at the same lattice spacing .",
    "the lattice spacing was tuned by making short runs on smaller lattices , adjusting the parameters to match the lattice spacing of an initial quenched run at @xmath3 .",
    "we use an improved kogut - susskind quark action which removes tree level order @xmath4 lattice artifacts@xcite .",
    "the gauge action is a one - loop symanzik improved action@xcite .",
    "this action has been shown to reduce flavor symmetry breaking and to improve rotational symmetry of the hadron spectrum , and to give improved scaling of hadron masses as a function of lattice spacing@xcite .",
    "another important improvement of these calculations over previous generations is that we use three flavors of dynamical quarks . for quark masses larger than the strange quark mass we use three degenerate flavors , and for light quark masses less than @xmath5",
    "we use two light flavors , keeping the third quark mass at about the strange quark mass .",
    "we have also done one two - flavor simulation on a matched lattice to check for effects of the dynamical strange quark . for the runs with @xmath6 dynamical flavors",
    ", we computed hadron spectra using valence quark masses equal to the sea quark masses . in the quenched run we computed hadron masses with valence quarks with the same masses , and nondegenerate propagators using a strange quark mass of @xmath7 .",
    "finally , in the two dynamical flavor run we computed hadron propagators using light quark masses equal to the dynamical mass , @xmath8 and a non - dynamical strange quark with @xmath7 .",
    "two issues that we do not completely address are extrapolation to zero lattice spacing and extrapolation to the physical light quark mass . using",
    "matched quenched and full qcd lattices allows us to draw conclusions about the effects of dynamical quarks without explicit continuum extrapolation .",
    "although it is in principle possible that the discretization errors in quenched and full qcd are very different , we expect that the differences in lattice spacing dependence are in fact comparable to the differences in physical quantities themselves . since corrections to scaling are in any case quite small with our current improved action@xcite ( see also below ) , we confidently expect conclusions drawn at fixed lattice spacing to survive in the continuum limit .",
    "we are beginning a series of simulations at a smaller lattice spacing which will eventually allow us to make the continuum extrapolation .",
    "a few preliminary quenched points from these finer lattice runs are included here to give an idea of the size of these effects .",
    "a complete chiral extrapolation will be more difficult . in this work ,",
    "we attempt an explicit chiral extrapolation only for the shape of the static quark potential , and show other quantities as functions of the quark mass . some quantities such as `` @xmath9''@xcite are only minimally sensitive to chiral extrapolation , and such quantites provide immediately useful tests of dynamical quark effects .",
    "in addition to presenting hadron spectra , we update our computation of the static quark potential . for this quantity",
    "we have sufficiently accurate data that we can hazard an extrapolation to zero quark mass to produce numbers that can be compared with phenomenological potential models .",
    "because the static potential is determined very accurately , it clearly shows differences between quenched and full qcd .",
    "in fact , one can even see the differences between two and three dynamical flavors , and a `` kink '' in the plots where we change from three degenerate flavors to two light and one heavy indicates a noticeable difference between two light plus one heavy and three light dynamical flavors .    in the meson sector",
    "we find differences between full and quenched qcd . a nice way of exposing these differences is the ratio @xmath9 proposed by lacock and michael@xcite .",
    "we find that this quantity is in better agreement with experiment in full qcd than in the quenched approximation , as predicted in @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with results of the cp - pacs@xcite and jlqcd@xcite collaborations , who also conclude that inclusion of two flavors of dynamical quarks improves agreement of the lattice spectrum with the real world .    in the isovector @xmath10 ( @xmath1 ) channel",
    "we find a large difference between quenched and three - flavor results .",
    "we interpret the three flavor results as an avoided level crossing between the @xmath0 meson and a two pseudoscalar state .",
    "in other words , we see the @xmath1 decay to two mesons .    we include tables of the mass fits we have chosen , so the reader can compute his or her own favorite mass ratios .",
    "for our two and three flavor simulations we used the standard hybrid - molecular dynamics `` r algorithm '' , @xcite with one pseudofermion field for runs with degenerate quarks , and two pseudofermion fields for runs with different strange and up and down quark masses . in all cases , we used trajectories with unit length in the simulation time . basic parameters of these runs are summarized in table [ run_table ] .",
    "two sources of systematic error in this method are the accuracy of the approximate sparse matrix solution required at each time step in the integration of the molecular dynamics equations , and the effect of the nonzero time step used in the integration .",
    "we have investigated these effects in the 2 + 1 flavor simulations at @xmath11 with two flavors of quarks at mass @xmath8 and one flavor with @xmath7 on a @xmath12 lattice .",

    "[ mpi_res_fig ] .",
    "since the effect of this error is poorly understood , we adopted a conservative choice of @xmath14 or @xmath15 in most of our runs , and used @xmath16 for the heaviest quark mass ( @xmath17 ) where convergence was very fast .",

    "note that the finite step size corrections are quite sensitive to the action being used  even the sign of the effect differs between the two actions . based on these tests and previous experience , we used a step size of no more than two - thirds of the light quark mass or 0.03 , whichever was smaller , in our production runs . in the production run at @xmath26",
    "we used a step size of @xmath28 . from the slope in fig .",
    "[ pbp_step_fig ] we can infer that this caused a fractional error in @xmath29 of about 0.004 , and a similar analysis for the plaquette suggests a fractional error of about 0.0006 .",

    "because of the oscillating components in the staggered quark propagators , it sometimes happens that the fractional error exceeds the threshold at one distance but is smaller at larger distances , so the complete criterion for the maximum distance included is the largest distance such that the fractional error on each of the next two points exceeds 0.3 .",
    "since the points at largest distance contribute little information , the exact large distance cutoff is not critical . to choose the minimum distance included , we first went through the fits and chose a minimum distance for each hadron in each dataset , choosing a distance where the confidence level was reasonable and where the mass appeared to reach a plateau . as expected , some propagators had larger(smaller ) fluctuations than other similar propagators , resulting in the choice of a larger(smaller ) minimum distance .",

    "most of this is due to the larger statistical errors at smaller quark mass , which result in the excited state contributions disappearing into the noise at shorter distance .",

    "we choose the @xmath117 mass difference because the statistical error in @xmath9 is dominated by the error in the vector meson masses , and the larger difference in @xmath117 relative to , say , @xmath118 leads to smaller statistical errors on @xmath9 .",
    "because all of the masses in eq .  [ j_eq ] are correlated , we use a jackknife analysis to compute the error on @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ j_fig ] shows the results for @xmath9 in quenched and three flavor qcd .",
    "following ukqcd , we plot this versus @xmath119 , for which the real world value is 1.8 .",
    "the burst is the real world value of this definition of @xmath9 ( 0.49 ) , and the cross is the value of @xmath9 found in the ukqcd quenched simulations . we see a clear effect of the sea quarks on this quantity .",
    "indeed , any reasonable extrapolation of our data in @xmath119 would pass near the real world point .",
    "figure  [ j_fig ] also contains one point with two dynamical flavors .",
    "this point falls near the three flavor points , indicating that the dynamical strange quark is less important than the two light quarks . although our quenched results are somewhat higher than the ukqcd value , they are significantly below the experimental value .",
    "the fact that the quenched points in this plot are to the right of the full qcd points is largely due to the fact that the mass of @xmath26 used for the quenched strange quark was too small , as discussed above .",
    "if we use the observed slopes of the quenched vector meson masses and squared pseudoscalar masses as functions of quark mass to adjust these points to a quenched strange quark mass of @xmath113 , the main effect is to shift the quenched points to the left . in particular , the rightmost quenched point moves to @xmath120 , but moves up by only 0.004 .",

    "fitting these particles is difficult because of their larger mass . in order to get good fits , we need to allow two particles in the non - oscillating components , since we typically find that the excited `` @xmath124 '' or `` @xmath125 '' state is comparable in mass to the lowest oscillating ( p - wave ) state .",
    "thus we find large errors , and must use small minimum distances to get good fits .",

    "the corner source propagators reach a plateau earlier and with smaller error bars . however , there are perfectly acceptable fits to the full wall source propagators giving masses significantly smaller than the corner source values .",
    "perhaps the only good thing we can say about this situation is that the effect is similar in the quenched and dynamical runs , so as long as we are careful to make the same choices in both cases , we can investigate the effects of sea quarks on the spectrum while taking the statistical errors at face value .",
    "the results of the fits that we selected are listed in tables  [ baryon_mass_table ] and [ delta_mass_table ] .",

    "[ ape_both_fig ] we show a variant of the edinburgh plot , the `` ape plot '' , where @xmath41 is used as the abscissa , so that for small quark masses the abscissa is proportional to the quark mass .",

    "we are hopeful that currently running three flavor simulations at finer lattice spacing will shed new light here .",
    "figure  [ ape_both_fig ] also contains a point from a coarser lattice three flavor run and a preliminary point from a finer lattice quenched run ( @xmath70 , @xmath139 lattice , @xmath71 fm ) these two points suggest that when we are in a position to do a continuum extrapolation the continuum results will be lower .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results to the conventional kogut - susskind quark action .",

    "@xmath142@xcite and @xmath143@xcite , which correspond to lattice spacings of about @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and 0.043 fm respectively . while a continuum extrapolation will be deferred until the 0.1 fm runs are completed",
    ", we can see in this plot that the improved action at 0.13 fm gives results similar to the conventional action at @xmath147 fm .    just as for the mesons ,",
    "one of the biggest problems in comparing baryon masses to the real world is the need for an extrapolation in quark mass . for the mesons the quantity @xmath9 has the nice feature that it is only minimally sensitive to this extrapolation .",
    "it is tempting to try to construct similar quantities for the baryons .",
    "this suggests looking at the @xmath148 , the @xmath149 decuplet baryon .",
