    "in his annotations to the history of retrovirology in the standard textbook _ `` retroviruses '' _ peter k. vogt links thomas kuhn s ideas of patterns of scientific revolutions ( kuhn , 1962 ) to several paradigm changes which happened during the development of retrovirology ( vogt , 1997 , p. 16 ) .",
    "one of the major and most prominent `` revolution '' was the detection of `` reverse transcription '' , more exactly , the identification of an rna - dependent dna polymerase in rna tumor viruses ( temin and mizutani , 1970 ; baltimore , 1970 ) .",
    "the idea of the occurrence of a dna `` provirus '' intermediate in the infectious cycle of rous sarcoma virus had been formulated already several years before ( temin , 1964 ) . because this hypothesis required the repeal of the so - called `` central dogma '' of molecular biology ( one - way transfer of genetic information from dna to rna to protein ) it was not taken seriously by the majority of the researchers in the discipline .",
    "the evidence of reverse transfers of genetic information ( from rna to dna ) was therefore indeed a scientific revolution . + it is certainly of interest to reproduce unequivocal paradigm changes in science by bibliometric tools .",
    "established techniques could be helpful in detecting ongoing transitions in scientific ( sub- ) fields .",
    "kuhn himself suggested to study `` shift(s ) in the distribution of the technical literature cited in the footnotes to research reports '' ( kuhn , 1962 , p.",
    "ix ) as possible indicators of paradigmatic changes in science . following kuhn s advice , henry small described in 1977 a paradigm shift in collagen research of the early 1970s ( small , 1977 ) .",
    "the shift was brought about by the discovery of the collagen precursor molecule _ procollagen _ which had profound influences on basic biology , biochemistry and medicine ( see small , 1977 , p. 147 ) .",
    "small traced the ( pro- ) collagen paradigm shift bibliometrically , applying co - citation analysis to the `` footnotes '' , i.e. the cited references in the collagen literature set ( small , 1977 ) .",
    "he did so by clustering all records of the appropriate publication years contained in the _ science citation index _",
    "year by year using definite citation / co - citation thresholds , followed by identifying the clusters with collagen literature and measuring the persistence of the cited references ( called `` reference stability '' ) in succeeding years and three year intervals ( small , 1977 ) . analysing the latter small found a citation `` gap '' in the three year interval 1971/1973 , i.e. none of the cited references found in the 1971 literature set was also found in the 1973 set .",
    "this finding conforms to the detection of procollagen in 1971 indicating a different citation behavior in years following the procollagen discovery ( small , 1977 ) .",
    "+ i could repeat and confirm small s work processing collagen literature sets retrieved by appropriate keyword searches ( stegmann , 2014 ) .",
    "i used small s technique of ( co- ) citation analysis and validated the results by exploring the frequencies of title words ( stegmann , 2014 ) .",
    "+ the present study analysed the literature on _ retroviruses _ published 1966 to 1975 in order to find bibliometric reflections of the _ reverse transcription _ paradigm change which happened in 1970 .",
    "the same methods as in stegmann ( 2014 ) were used .",
    "first , a pubmed search was conducted for the literature on retroviruses published 1966 to 1975 using appropriate mesh terms . a search in the publicly available database pubmed is indispensable for retrieval of biomedical literature .",
    "because pubmed records lack cited references it is desirable to retrieve pubmed equivalents with a cited references ( cr ) field .",
    "the web of science ( wos ) database records contain such a cr field .",
    "wos offers also an implementation of medline ( wos - m ) which is equivalent to pubmed s medline subset .",
    "so , the second step involved a search in wos - m using a search profile equivalent to that used in the pubmed search .",
    "however , records found in wos - m lack the cr field and also wos - specific record numbers ( field ut in wos records ) . to overcome this difficulty , the third step implied the application of the routine developed by rotolo and leydesdorff ( 2014 ) .",
    "the routine identified wos equivalents ( if present ) of wos - m records which were downloaded in the fourth step . in further steps",
    "the downloaded wos records were subjected to citation / co - citation and word frequency analyses .",
    "the downloaded pubmed literature set ( comprising about 25% more records than its wos pendant ) was subjected to word frequency analyses .",
    "+ i will show ( i ) that the data of the reference stability analyis of the keyword - derived literature on _ retroviruses _ published 1966 to 1975 clearly indicate a profound change in citation behavior in the early 1970s which can be interpreted as paradigm shift in retrovirus research , and ( ii ) that text analysis confirms this view due to the occurrence of the phrase _",
    "`` reverse transcriptase''_. + i will use throughout the present paper the term _ `` retrovirus(es ) '' _ instead of _ `` rna tumor viruses''_. the latter was used prior to the discovery of reverse transcription as an inherent feature of rna tumor viruses and is now used as an entry term ( synonym ) of the mesh term _",
    "`` retroviridae '' _ which was introduced 1981 and comprises the oncogenic retroviruses and two minor groups of non - oncogenic retroviruses .",
    "the search for the literature on _ retroviuses _ of the publication years 1966 - 1975 was performed on december 1 , 2014 , in the medline part of the web of science ( wos - m ) . because the wos - m records do neither contain a cr ( cited references ) nor an ut ( wos identifier ) field ( see introduction ) the routine developed by rotolo and leydesdorff ( 2014 ) was applied .",
    "the rotolo - leydesdorff script ( link given in the appendix of rotolo and leydesdorff , 2014 ) collects the ut field content , i.e. the unique number of document ( hidden in the html code of each wos - m record , provided it has a wos counterpart ) `` on the fly '' and writes it into a file .",
    "than , this file containing the uts of the wos equilvalents of wos - m records can be used to retrieve those wos equivalents ( rotolo and leydesdorff , 2014 ) . by use of the rotolo - leydesdorff script",
    "i retrieved the wos equivalents of the wos - m retrovirus papers .",
    "these wos counterparts were downloaded and subjected to analysis .",
    "+ the rotolo - leydesdorff routine is an _",
    "r - script _ , i.e. one must have installed the software package r ( r core team , 2013 ) . + the retrovirus - specific papers of the freely available database pubmed ( more exactly its medline subset ) was also retrieved and downloaded ( july 21 , 2014 ) .",
    "the reference stability index ( rsi ) was calculated exactly as described by small ( small , 1977 ; see also stegmann , 2014 )",
    ". applying certain citation / co - citation thresholds the cited core references of each year were determined , followed by determination of core references common to the compared publication years and the calculation of rsi .",
    "two year and three year intervals were analysed .",
    "document frequencies of title words - i.e. the number of records with at least one instance of the word in their titles - were determined for each publication year .",
    "stop words were excluded from the analysis .",
    "because the wos set and the pubmed / medline set of retrovirus - specific papers are of different size , text analysis was performed on both sets .",
    "frequency thresholds were applied , i.e. words had to occur in a certain number of papers .",
    "comparisons were done for two year and three year intervals .",
    "the occurrences of `` new '' words ( not present in the former year ) were checked .",
    "co - word analysis ( callon et al . , 1986 ) was also performed . for each possible",
    "pair of a year s distinct title words its cosine similarity was calculated .",
    "only term pairs with a cosine value equal to or greater than 0.25 ( corresponding to an angle of about 75@xmath0 ) were included in the subsequent frequency analysis . as with single words",
    "the occurrences of term pairs not present in the prior year of the two compared publication years were checked .",
    "extraction of record field contents , data analysis and visualisation were done using homemade programs and scripts for perl ( version 5.14.2 ) and the software package r version 2.14.1 ( r core team , 2013 ) .",

    "+ the distribution of these papers to their publication years is shown in table 1 .",
    "also shown are the number of distinct references cited by the ( wos ) papers of each year .",
    "the data presented in table 1 show that the number of both , papers and references , have more than tripled from 1966 to 1974 or 1975 .",
    "this is clearly more than the ( paper ) growth of the whole wos and pubmed databases which increase from 1966 to 1974/1975 by a factor of about 1.5 to 1.7 and 1.3 , respectively ( data not shown ) , indicating that retrovirus research experienced a major boost in the early 1970s .",
    "highly cited references can be regarded as symbols of relevant scientific concepts , and co - citation of those references can inform about the strenghts of links between the concepts ( small , 1977 ) .",
    "thus , to be able to detect paradigmatic changes of concepts , it is reasonable to apply certain citation / co - citation thresholds in reference stabiliy analysis ( small , 1977 ) .",
    "the results of the reference stability analysis under different thresholds are shown in table 2 and table 3 ( analysing two year intervals ) and table 4 ( analysing three year intervals ) .",
    "table 2 and table 3 list for each year the number of core references and the number of core references common to two successive years as well as the resulting rsi value .",

    "is / are introduced into retrovirology replacing former basic views of the specialty .",
    "that the minimal rsi values are close to but not equal to zero may depend on ( i ) the citation / co - citation thresholds applied , ( ii ) the time intervals investigated , and/or ( iii ) the publication date of the paper(s ) inducing the paradigm shift .",
    "papers and cited references are analysed on the basis of entire publication years .",
    "so , a groundbreaking paper published early in the year in a journal which is quickly absorbed by the scientific community might already be frequently cited in the same year .",
    "we see that under the thresholds 15/11 and 15/8 two cited references persist from 1970 to 1972 .",
    "application of the 11/9 threshold results in additional 4 shared core references , and under the 10/8 threshold two more core references are shared by the literature sets of 1970 and 1973 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "table 5 displays the cited reference strings of these core references .",
    "the main two cited references represent the famous _ nature _ papers of temin and mizutani ( 1970 ) and baltimore ( 1970 ) , persisting also under the strongest threshold used in this investigation .",
    "they clearly stand for the new paradigm _ reverse transcription _ which entered 1970 not only ( retro- ) virology but also the whole field of biomedicine .",
    "the two papers were published side by side in june 1970 . still in the same year",
    "both papers belong to the group of most often co - cited papers . in each of the subsequent years ( up to 1975 )",
    "they are the top co - cited papers and are also mostly the top cited papers ( data not shown ) .",
    "the temin / mizutani paper and the baltimore paper of 1970 are new at that time and they are found within the core references of the 1970 paper set .",
    "therefore , it is certainly advisable for an investigation looking for possible shifts in scientific concepts also to check whether new ( highly ) cited references appear .",
    "the rsi values of the two year interval 1970/1971 are similar to those of the other two year intervals ( see table 2 and table 3 ) because other ( older ; not shown ) references are present in both years ; thus they do not point to a possible paradigm change .",
    "within the three year interval 1970/1972 the old references are more loosely connected and appear only when thresholds are lowered ( see table 5 ) .",
    "in the subsequent years they do not have their previous significance and some of them even vanish from the list of core references ( not shown ) .",
    "+ in summary we can state that the reference stability analysis developed by henry small is able to detect the radical change in retrovirology caused by the discovery and the proof of reverse transcription .",
    "expert knowledge does nt seem to be obligatory provided a comprehensive subject - specific literature search is the basis of the study .",
    "analysis of three year intervals is certainly more adequate than shorter periods .",
    "the rsi can point to changes in citation behavior indicating profound shifts in the specialty .",
