    "causality is the fundamental principle pervading dynamical processes .",
    "any set of time - correlated events , from the development of an organism to historical changes , defines a feed - forward structure of causal relations captured by a family of complex networks called directed acyclic graphs ( dags ) .",
    "their structure has recently attracted the interest of researchers @xcite since dags represent time - ordered processes as well as a broad number of natural and artificial systems .",
    "examples would include simple electronic circuits @xcite , feed - forward neural @xcite and transmission networks @xcite , river basins @xcite , or even some food webs and chemical structures @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic example of a causal structure is the chart of the relations among states followed by a computational process through time .",
    "intimately linked to the topology of the computational chart of consecutive states , a fundamental feature of computations is its degree of _ logical reversibility _ @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is said that a process is _ logically reversible _ when , if reverting the flow of causality , i.e. going backwards from the computational outputs to their inputs , we can unambiguously recover the causal structure of the process . roughly speaking ,",
    "if we have a computer performing a function @xmath0 and we can unambiguously determine the input @xmath1 from the only knowledge of the value @xmath2 , we say that the function is logically reversible .",
    "otherwise , if there is uncertainty in determining @xmath1 from the only knowledge of @xmath3 , we say that the function is _ logically irreversible _ , and thus , additional information is needed to successfully reconstruct a given computational path .",
    "analogously , the potential scenarios emerging from an evolutionary process raise similar questions . within evolutionary biology ,",
    "a relevant problem is how predictable is evolutionary dynamics . in particular",
    ", it has been asked what would be the result of going backwards and `` re - playing the tape of evolution '' @xcite .",
    "since this question pervades the problem of how uncertain or predictable is a given evolutionary path , it seems desirable to actually provide a foundational framework .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically extend the concept of logical reversibility to the study of any causal structure having no cyclic topologies , thereby defining a broader concept to be named _",
    "topological reversibility_. whereas thermodynamical irreversibility implies thermodynamical entropy production @xcite , topological irreversibility implies statistical entropy _",
    "production_. in general , we will say that a dag is _ topologically reversible _ if we can unambiguously recover a path going backwards from any element to the origin .",
    "genealogies and phylogenies are examples of tree - like structures where a chronological order can be established among the events and an unambiguous reconstruction of the lineage can be performed for every element of the graph @xcite . following this argument , we will label a graph as _ topologically irreversible _ when some uncertainty is observed in the reconstruction of trajectories .    as shown below",
    ", the entropy presented here weigths the extra amount of information that would be required to recover the causal flow backwards .",
    "information measures are not new in the study of complex networks @xcite , although such measures accounted for connectivity correlations @xcite or were used to characterize a gibbsian formulation of the statistical mechanics of complex networks @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the starting point of our formalism resembles the classical theory of bayesian networks .",
    "however , the particular treatment of reversibility proposed here is qualitatively different from the concept of uncertainty used in such a framework and closer to the one described in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ theoreticalbackground ] we provide the basic concepts underlying our analytical derivations . section [ ff1 ] provides the general mathematical definition of topological reversibility and the general expression for the average uncertainty associated to the reversion of the causal flow .",
    "this is consistently derived from the properties of the adjacency matrix . in section [ extremal ]",
    "we consider two limit cases , finding the exact analytic form for their entropies and predicting the uncertain configuration .",
    "finally , in section [ hierarchyirreversibility ] we outline the generality and relevance of our results in terms of characterizing dag structure .",
    "the theoretical roots of this paper stem from fundamental notions of directed graph theory @xcite , ordered set theory @xcite and information theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , we make use of shannon s entropy which , as originally defined , quantifies the uncertainty associated to certain collections of random events @xcite . in our framework , the entropy in a given feed - forward graph measures the uncertainty in reversing the causal flow depicted by the arrows .",
    "let @xmath4 be a directed graph , being @xmath5 , the set of nodes , and @xmath6 the set of edges -where the order , @xmath7 implies that there is an arrow in the following direction : @xmath8 .",
    "given a node @xmath9 , the number of outgoing links , to be written as @xmath10 , is called the _ out - degree _ of @xmath11 and the number of ingoing links of @xmath11 is called the _ in - degree _ of @xmath11 , written as @xmath12 .",
    "the _ adjacency matrix _ of a given graph @xmath13 , @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 ; and @xmath16 otherwise . through the adjacency matrix , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are computed as @xmath19 furthermore , we will use the known relation between the @xmath20-th power of the adjacency matrix and the number of paths of length @xmath20 going from a given node @xmath11 to a given node @xmath21 specifically , @xmath22 is the number of paths of length @xmath20 going from node @xmath11 to node @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a _ feed - forward _ or _ directed acyclic graph _ is a directed graph characterized by the absence of cycles : if there is a _ directed path _ from @xmath11 to @xmath23 ( i.e. , there is a finite sequence @xmath24 ) then , there is no directed path from @xmath23 to @xmath11 .",
    "conversely , the matrix @xmath25 depicts a dag with the same underlying structure but having all the arrows ( and thus , the causal flow ) inverted .",
    "given its acyclic nature , one can find a finite value @xmath26 as follows : @xmath27 it is easy to see that @xmath28 is the length of the longest path of the graph .",
    "the existence of such @xmath26 can be seen as a test for acyclicity .",
    "however , the use of leaf - removal algorithms @xcite , i.e. the iterative pruning of nodes without outgoing links , is by far more suitable than the above method , in terms of computational costs . in a dag , a leaf - removal algorithm removes completely the graph in a finite number of iterations , specifically , in @xmath26 iterations -see eq . ( [ k ] ) .",
    "now we study the interplay between dags and order relations .",
    "borrowing concepts from order theory @xcite , we define the following set : @xmath29 to be named the set of _ maximal nodes _ of @xmath30 , by which @xmath31 .",
    "the set of all paths @xmath32 , @xmath33 , from @xmath34 to a given node @xmath35 is indicated as @xmath36 .",
    "given a node @xmath35 , the set of all paths from @xmath34 to @xmath11 is written as @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , we will define the set @xmath38 as the set of all nodes participating in this path , except the maximal one .",
    "additionally , one can define the set of nodes with @xmath39 as the set of _ minimal nodes _ of @xmath40 , to be named @xmath41 .",
    "notice that the absence of cycles implies that @xmath42 and that the set of minimals @xmath41 must also contain at least one element -see fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) .    attending to the node relations depicted by the arrows , and due to the acyclic property , at least one node ordering can be defined , establishing a natural link between order theory and dags .",
    "this order is achieved by labeling all the nodes with sequential natural numbers and obtaining a configuration such that : @xmath43 accordingly , dags are _ ordered graphs _ @xcite . however , as order relations imply _ transitivity _ , it is not the dag but its transitive closure what properly defines the order relation among the elements of @xmath44 .",
    "the _ transitive closure _ of @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , to be written as @xmath45 is defined as follows : any pair of nodes @xmath46 by which there is at least one path going from @xmath11 to @xmath23 are connected through a link @xmath47 in @xmath48 . in this framework , for a given number of maximal nodes , in the transitive closure the addition of a link either creates a cycle or destroys a maximal or minimal node .",
    "if the pairs defining the set of links of @xmath49 are conceived as the elements of a set relation @xmath50 , such a relation satisfies the following three properties : @xmath51 the dag definition implies that @xmath52 directly satisfies the two first conditions whilst the third one ( transitivity ) is only warranted for @xmath53 .",
    "thus , only @xmath53 holds all requirements to be an _ order relation _ ,",
    "specifically , a _ strict partial order_. the transitive closure of a given dag can be obtained by means of the so - called _ warshall s _",
    "algorithm @xcite .",
    "finally , a subgraph @xmath54 is said to be _ linearly ordered _ or _ totally ordered _",
    "provided that for all pairs of nodes @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , then @xmath57 let us notice that if we understand @xmath58 as a set relation @xmath59 , @xmath60 is a _",

    "analogously , we can define the _",
    "conditional entropy_. given another system @xmath76 containing @xmath77 values or choices , whose behavior is governed by a random variable @xmath78 , let @xmath79 be the conditional probability of obtaining @xmath80 if we already know @xmath81 .",
    "then , the conditional entropy of @xmath78 from @xmath65 , to be written as @xmath82 , is defined as : @xmath83 which is typically interpreted as a noise term in information theory .",
    "such a noise term can be interpreted as the minimum amount of extra bits needed to unambiguously determine the input set from the only knowledge of the output set",
    ". this will be the key quantity of our paper , for it accounts for the _ dissipation _ of information in a given process .",

    "let us imagine that a node @xmath35 of a given dag @xmath30 , receives the visit of a random walker that follows the flow chart depicted by the dag .",
    "we only know that it began its walk at a given maximal node and it followed a downstream random path attending to the directions of the arrows to reach the node @xmath11 .",
    "suppose also that the global structure of the graph is unknown .",
    "what is the uncertainty associated to the followed path ?",
    "in other words , what is the amount of information we need , on average , to successfully perform the backward process ?      as we mentioned above ,",
    "the starting point of our derivation is close to treatment of bayesian networks @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "the first task is to define the probability to follow a given path @xmath86 when reverting the process .",
    "let @xmath38 be the set of nodes participating in the path @xmath87 except the maximal ones .",
    "maximal nodes are not included in this set because they are the ends of the path of the reversal process . the probability to chose such a path from node @xmath11 by making a random decision at every crossing when reverting the causal flow will be : @xmath88 consistently : @xmath89",
    "as @xmath90 is a probability distribution , we can compute the uncertainty associated to a reversal of the causal flow , starting the reversion process from a given node @xmath91 , to be written as @xmath92 : @xmath93 the overall uncertainty of @xmath13 , written as @xmath94 , is computed by averaging @xmath95 over all non - maximal nodes , i.e : @xmath96      the main combinatorial object of our approach is not the adjacency matrix but instead a mathematical representation of the probability to visit a node @xmath98 starting the backward flow from a given , different node @xmath99 regardless the distance separating them .",

    "first we define @xmath102 as : @xmath103 where @xmath104 indicates the amount of _ local _ entropy introduced in a given node when performing the reversion process -see fig ( [ fig2 ] ) . thereby , it is the amount of information needed to properly revert the flow backwards when a bifurcation point is reached having @xmath17 possible choices .",

    "@xmath30 : @xmath108 this represents the probability to reach @xmath21 starting from @xmath11 .",
    "now we derive the general expression for @xmath97 .",

    "we first notice two important facts linking paths and the powers of the adjacency matrix that are only generically valid in dag - like networks .",
    "first , we observe that : @xmath109 being @xmath28 the length of the longest path of the graph as defined by ( [ k ] ) .",
    "analogously , the number of paths of @xmath110 crossing @xmath23 , to be written as @xmath111 is : @xmath112 the above quantities provide the number of paths . to compute the probability to reach a given node",
    ", we have to take into account the probability to follow a given path containing such a node , defined in ( [ pprod ] ) .",
    "to rigorously connect it to the adjacency matrix , we first define an auxiliary , @xmath113 matrix @xmath114 , namely : @xmath115 where @xmath116 . from this definition ,",
    "we obtain the explicit dependency of @xmath97 from the adjacency matrix , namely is the matrix corresponding to a markov process @xcite depicting a random walker walking against the flow ] , @xmath117 and accordingly , we have @xmath118 it is worth to mention that @xmath119 resembles the transition matrix related to the concept of _ information mobility _ @xcite . in the general case of non - directed graphs , one can assume the presence of paths of arbitrary length , which leads ( using a correction factor tied to the length of the path ) up to an asymptotic form of the transition matrix in terms of the exponential of the adjacency matrix",
    ". however , the intrinsic finite nature of the paths in a given dag makes the above asymptotic treatment non viable .",
    "let us now define the overall entropy in a compact form , only depending on the adjacency matrix of the graph . from eqs .",
    "( [ h(y|x ) ] , [ entropia1 ] , [ h(v_i ) ] ) , we obtain @xmath120 this is the central equation of this paper .",
    "this measure quantifies the additional information ( other than topological one ) to properly revert the causal flow .",
    "we observe that this expression is a _ noise _ term within standard information theory @xcite . in this equation",
    "we have been able to decouple the combinatorial term associated to the multiplicity of paths at one hand , and the particular contribution to the overall uncertainty of every node , at the other hand .",
    "the former is fulfilled by the matrix @xmath97 , which encodes combinatorial properties of the system , and how they influence in the computation of the entropies .",
    "the latter is obtained from the set of local entropies @xmath121 .",
    "these terms account for the contribution of local topology -i.e .",
    "the uncertainty when choosing an incoming link at the node level in the reversion of the causal flow- to the overall entropy .",
    "this uncoupling is a consequence of the extensive property of the entropy and , putting aside its conceptual interest , simplifies all derivations related to the uncertainties , since we are not forced to compute the complex series arising in the brute - force calculation of entropies .",
    "this general expression of the entropy can be simplified if we assume that @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , by defining @xmath124    and thus @xmath125 is expressed as : @xmath126 finally , we recall that the above entropy is bounded by jensen s inequality ( [ jensen ] ) i.e. , @xmath127 notice that the quantity on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ hmg1 ] ) is the uncertainty obtained by considering all paths from @xmath34 to @xmath11 equally likely to occur .",
    "having defined an appropriate and well grounded entropy measure , now we can discuss the meaning of _ topological ( ir)reversibility_. let us first make a qualitative link with standard theory of irreversible thermodynamics , where irreversibility is tied to the parameter of entropy production @xmath128 in the entropy balance equation @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath129 depicts _ thermodynamically reversible _ processes , whereas @xmath130 appears in _ irreversible _ processes @xcite .",
    "irreversibility is rooted in the impossibility of reverting the process without generating a negative amount of entropy , which contradicts to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "consistently , we will call _ topologically reversible _ those dag structures such that @xmath131 in those structures ( they belong to the set of trees , as we shall see in the following section ) no ambiguity arises when performing the reversion process . on the contrary , a given dag by which @xmath132 will be referred to as _",
    "topologically irreversible_. dags having @xmath133 display some degree of uncertainty taking the causal flow backwards , since the reversion process is subject to some random inevitable decisions . in these cases",
    ", @xmath125 is the average of the amount of extra information needed to successfully perform the process backwards .",
    "similarly , the successful reversion of a thermodynamically irreversible process would imply the ( irreversible ) addition of external energy , or that the reversion of a logically irreversible computation requires an extra amount of external information to solve the ambiguity arising in rewinding the chain of computations . in this context , for example",
    ", reversible computation is defined by considering a system of storage of history of the computational process @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe that , roughly speaking , we can associate the logical ( ir)reversibility of a computational process to the topological ( ir)reversibility of its dag representation . in our study ,",
    "the adjective _ topological _ arises from the fact that we only use topological information to compute the uncertainty .",
    "thus , we deliberately neglect the active role that a given node can play as , for example , a processing unit , or the different weights of the paths .",
    "however , it is worth to mention that entropy can be generalized for dags where links are weighted by a probability to be chosen in the process of reaching the maximal .",
    "let us illustrate our previous results by exploring two limit cases , namely dags having zero or maximal uncertainty . in this section we identify those feed - forward structures which",
    ", containing @xmath64 nodes and without a predefined number of links , minimize or maximize the above uncertainties . in this way ,",
    "for example , a chain having @xmath134 will display @xmath135 , whereas its somehow opposite graph , the star having @xmath136 will have @xmath137 .",
    "the derivation of the limit scenarios will be more sophisticated , due to the active role of combinatorics in defining the paths .",
    "the minimum uncertainties are obtained when the graph @xmath40 is a special kind of tree , to be described below .",
    "afterwards , we also derive the graph configuration with maximum entropy .",
    "the conceptual starting point of this derivation is the graph representation of the linear order .",

    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "from such a maximal node , there exists only one path to a given node . in the evolutionary context ,",
    "a single ancestor is at the root of all evolutionary tree @xcite .",
    "thus , the process of recovering the history of the random walker up to its initial condition is completely deterministic , and no uncertainty can be associated to it -in purely topological terms .",
    "formally , we recognize two defining features on trees , namely :    * @xmath134 * @xmath140 .    we thus conclude that there is no uncertainty in recovering the flow , since the two reported properties are enough to conclude that there is @xmath141 and only @xmath141 path to go from @xmath34 to any @xmath142 .",
    "this agrees with the intuitive idea that trees are perfect hierarchical structures .",
    "this result complements the more standard scenario of the forward , downstream scenario paths followed by a random walker on a tree @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that evolutionary trees , particularly in unicellular organisms , have been found to be a poor representation of the actual evolutionary process @xcite .",
    "now we consider the maximum entropic scenario . for this purpose",
    ", we cut the problem in two pieces : first , we constructively obtain the feed forward graph containing @xmath143 maximal nodes maximizing @xmath144 .",
    "once we identified such a feed forward configuration , we ask for the @xmath143 that maximizes such a quantity .",
    "let @xmath30 be a feed - forward organized graph containing @xmath64 nodes , where @xmath143 of them are maximal .",
    "since for the entropy computation all nodes become indistinguishable , let @xmath146 be the ensemble of different possible feed - forward configurations containing @xmath64 nodes , where @xmath143 of them are maximal .",
    "we are looking for a graph , to be written as @xmath147 , such that @xmath148 : @xmath149 i.e. , a graph containing all possible links , preserving the number of maximal nodes .",
    "this implies , as defined in section [ basicgdef ] , eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) , that we must add links to the set @xmath145 until it becomes _ linearly ordered _ , attending to a labeling of nodes which respect the ordering depicted by the feed - forward graph ( see fig .",

    "we thus obtain a feed forward graph containing @xmath143 maximal nodes and only @xmath141 minimal node . in the above constructed graph ,",
    "any new link creates a cycle or destroys a maximal vertex .",
    "furthermore , given two fixed values of @xmath143 and @xmath64 , it is straightforward to demonstrate that it maximizes any entropy based on paths : any feed - forward graph of the ensemble @xmath146 other than @xmath152 is obtained by removing edges of @xmath152 .",
    "this edge removal process will necessarily result in a reduction of uncertainty .    for the sake of clarity we differentiate the labeling of @xmath34 and @xmath145 when working with @xmath152 .",

    "the standard view of the tree of life involves a directional , upward time - arrow where the genetic structure of a given species ( its genome ) derives from some ancestor after splitting ( speciation ) events .",
    "one would think that this classical but too simplistic view of evolution as a tree gives a topologically reversible lineage of genes , changing by mutations and passing from the initial ancestor to current species in a vertical inheritance .",
    "however , it has been recently evidenced that the so - called horizontal gene transfer among unrelated species may have had a deep impact in the evolution and diversification in microbes @xcite . according to this genetic mechanism the tree - like and thus the logical / topological reversibility is broken by the presence of cross - links between _ brother _ species . at the light of these evidences ,",
    "tree - based phylogenies become unrealistic . in this context , our theoretical approach provides a suitable framework for the characterization of the logical irreversibility of biological evolution and , in general , for any process where time or energy dissipation impose a feed - forward chart of events .",
