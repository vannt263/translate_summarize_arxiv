    "jet quenching , as observed in heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite , has become an important probe of a deconfined state of matter with quasi - free quarks and gluons , the so - called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "indeed , this observable allows inferences on the properties of the expanding medium .",
    "especially jet quenching of heavy flavors charm @xmath0 and bottom @xmath1 could be an ideal probe of the qgp . due to the large massgev , @xmath2gev ] of these quarks , @xmath3 ,",
    "they are produced in a very early stage of the collision and can later be considered as test particles in the ( equilibrated ) heat bath .",
    "the quenching of light quarks is well understood as an effect of radiative energy loss when propagating through the medium @xcite . however , in the case of heavy quarks pure radiative energy loss seems not sufficient to explain experimental data ( mainly from electron yields ) on heavy flavor quenching @xcite , suggesting surprisingly strong attenuation .",
    "there is an ongoing debate on the underlying reasons , which could be possibly clarified by analyzing spectra from heavy flavor decays .",
    "an additional contribution of suppression , potentially important for the range of smaller ( to medium ) momenta , is the collisional energy loss by elastic processes as discussed in @xcite and with further modifications in @xcite .",
    "it will turn out that in our approach a fairly large collisional energy loss is predicted , although some comparisons between collisional and radiative contributions @xcite indicate another picture where the collisional loss should be relatively small ( @xmath4 ) compared to the radiative one .",
    "this conclusion was , however , based on a fixed coupling approach , and using a naive approximation for the required infrared regulator in the qcd cross section . in the following work both aspects will be considered in a more precise way , aiming at providing a computational framework to describe binary parton collision effects more reliably , which seems necessary as a baseline to understand quenching in heavy - ion experiments .",
    "noted in this context is that certain observables might be more sensitive to the inclusion of binary collisions than the averaged energy loss , due to different probability distributions of radiative and collisional processes @xcite .",
    "we start with a short overview of the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark in a static qgp with temperature @xmath5 .",

    "the soft contribution to @xmath6 can be calculated from the imaginary part of the hard thermal loop ( htl ) dressed heavy quark self - energy @xcite .",

    "<S> we develop a transport approach for heavy quarks in a quark - gluon plasma , which is based on improved binary collision rates taking into account quantum statistics , the running of the qcd coupling and an effective screening mass adjusted to hard - thermal loop calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the effects of in - medium collisions by calculating the heavy flavor nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow for rhic energies , which are comparable to radiative effects . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an analytic formula for the mean collisional energy loss of an energetic heavy quark in a streaming quark gluon plasma .    elastic energy loss , mean energy loss , heavy quarks , jet quenching , nuclear modification factor , elliptic flow </S>"
