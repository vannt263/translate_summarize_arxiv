    "the most obvious manifestations of so - called ` eruptive phenomena in early stellar evolution ' ( herbig , 1977 ) are relatively short ( from days to hundreds years ) episodes of increased brightness observed in t tauri stars , i.e. low - mass @xmath2  m@xmath3 young ( age @xmath4  myr ) stars that contracting toward the main - sequence .",
    "it is widely accepted now that such events occur due to clearing of circumstellar gas - dust envelope or / and increasing of accretion rate @xmath5 of matter from a protoplanetary disc ( see , e.g. audard et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the physical reasons that are responsible for the @xmath5 increasing are of special interest . in young binary systems",
    "such events can occur due to gravitational influence of each component of a system on the circumstellar disc of the neighboring star near the periastron passage .",
    "such possibility was initially predicted theoretically ( bonnell , bastien , 1992 ; artymowicz , lubow , 1996 ) and later observed in a number of young binaries ( see , e.g. jensen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the aim of our paper is to search for a correlation between the orbital motion and the photometric behavior in young binaries vy  tau and xz  tau .",
    "the photometric variability of xz  tau was discovered by p.f.shain ( beljawsky , 1928 ) .",
    "the star is projected onto the dark cloud l1551 , has m3 spectral type , and its spectrum exhibits strong emission lines with equivalent width of h@xmath6 line up to 270   .",
    "the set of these features was the reason to include the star in the initial list of t tauri stars ( joy , 1945 ) and to classify it from the present - day viewpoint as a classical t tauri star ( ctts ) , i.e. low mass young star activity of which is due to accretion of protoplanetary disk s matter .",
    "haas et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found that to north of the more bright ( at that moment ) star xz  tau  s there is a companion xz  tau  n at a distance of about 0.3  arcsec , what respects to projected distance of 42  au if to adopt the distance to xz  tau to be 140  pc ( elias , 1978 ) .",
    "it was found that both stars are cttss , and the n component has more early spectral type ( m1.5 ) than the s component and therefore is more massive ( white , ghez , 2001 ) . none the less it is adopted in the literature to designate xz  tau  s as the main component of the system , i.e. as xz  tau  a , and xz tau n as a companion , i.e. xz  tau  b. we will also follow this tradition .",
    "xz  tau was identified by mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) as the source of a bipolar , collimated outflow .",
    "it appeared that the outflow occurs from each component of the binary , and that the jet of xz  tau  a is oriented along a position angle ( @xmath7 ) of @xmath8 while the jet of xz  tau  b along @xmath7 of @xmath9 ( krist et al . , 2008 ) . besides krist et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) discovered in the inner parts of the outflow an unusual expanding bubble of emission nebulosity .",
    "the bubble appears to be a succession of bubbles , the outer boundary of which reached an extent of @xmath10  arcsec from the binary in 2005 .",
    "the jet from xz  tau  a is aligned with the outflow axis of the bubbles , and krist et al .",
    "( 2008 ) believe that the bubbles are resulted from large velocity pulses of this jet .",
    "judging from the dynamical time of the bubble s expansion one can conclude that the large velocity pulses have occurred between 1965 and 1985 .",
    "bear in mind that high velocity ejection of gas in young binary df  tau was accompanied with a short - time increase of stellar brightness of @xmath11  mag ( li et al . , 2001 ) , it would be interesting to search for similar flares in xz  tau in the respective epoch . since the distance between xz  tau s components gradually decreased after 1990 , krist et al .",
    "( 2008 ) concluded that the gas ejection was not connected with the moment of periastron passage .",
    "but carrasco - gonzalez et al . (",
    "2009 ) found from their very large array ( vla ) observations that at 7  mm the xz  tau  a radio component resolves into a binary with 0.09  arcsec ( 13  au ) separation , suggesting that xz  tau is actually a triple star system .",
    "they have assumed that the ejection of gas from the xz  tau system may be related to a periastron passage of this newly discovered close binary system xz  tau  ac .    but follow - up vla - observations of forgan et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , as well as recent observations of alma partnership et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) find no evidence of xz  tau  c component , despite improved sensitivity and resolution .",
    "three possible interpretations were offered : either xz  tau  c is transiting xz  tau  a , or the emission seen in 2004 by carrasco - gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) was that of a transient , or xz  tau  c does not exist .",
    "thus the question is open and it is a good time to analyze an additional astrometric and photometric information about the system .",
    "vy  tau , the second target of our investigation , is also very interesting object .",
    "its photometric variability was discovered by beljawsky ( 1924 ) , who reported that the photographic magnitude of the star varied from 13 to 9.7  mag in 1906 - 1922 .",
    "follow - up observations revealed vy  tau s light curve , featuring sporadic outbursts from about @xmath12 to 11 - 12  mag with duration from 100 to 700  days interspersed with many years of inactivity ( see herbig ( 1990 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the star is projected onto the dark cloud l1536 , has ( at minimum light ) m0v spectral type with h@xmath13 and caii  h ,  k lines in emission and strong lii  6707   line in absorption . based on these features ( herbig , kameswara  rao , 1972 ) have attributed vy  tau to t tauri type stars .",
    "the relatively small equivalent width of h@xmath13 line in a quiet state ( ew@xmath14   ) and the negligible near - infrared ( nir ) excess emission are the reasons to conclude that the star has no accretion disk ( herbig , 1990 ) and thus belongs to so - called weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) .    according to the modern paradigm ,",
    "an observed activity of wttss is attributed to the presence of powerful chromospheres and coronas more or less similar to solar .",
    "but it is impossible to explain sporadic outbursts of vy  tau using the analogy with solar flares . at first , the duration of the outbursts is almost three order of magnitudes larger than that of solar chromospheric flares .",
    "secondly , while during the outburst vy  tau becomes more blue , low - level emission lines of fei , sii and mgi dominate in its spectrum , whereas higher excitation species such as feii and the balmer lines are relatively weak ( herbig , 1990 ) , as contrasted to solar flares .",
    "herbig suggested that the outburst activity of vy  tau is connected in one way or another with binarity of the star .",
    "he also noted that his analysis of vy  tau spectrum was based on observations carried out prior to 1972 , when the star was last active , and there is need for a modern reinvestigation particularly when the activity resumes .",
    "we will see below that the inactive state of the star lasted up to the end of 2012 following which outbursts apparently have renewed .",
    "leinert et al .",
    "( 1993 ) discovered at a distance of about 0.7  arcsec a companion vy  tau  b , which was at that moment four times weaker in @xmath15-band than the main star vy  tau  a. follow - up observations of white , ghez ( 2001 ) and mccabe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have confirmed the existence of the companion , but it was impossible to state that the relative position of a and b components varies with time . adopting the distance to vy  tau to be 160 pc ( herczeg , hillenbrand , 2014 ) , the projected distance between the components is @xmath16  au , so it looks unrealistic to explain vy  tau outburst activity as a result of interaction between a and b components of the binary .",
    "therefore , if herbig s hypothesis is correct , then one more component should be in the system .",
    "thus  as in the case of xz  tau  it is very important to obtain new photometric and astrometric information about vy  tau .",
    "speckle interferometry of vy  tau and xz  tau was performed with the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences on the night of 2014 february 12/13 .",
    "a system of speckle image detection based on a ccd with internal signal amplification was used ( maksimov et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "speckle interferograms were obtained with filters having central wavelengths / half - widths of 700/40 , 800/100 , 900/60 nm in the case of xz  tau and 800/100 nm in the case of vy  tau .",
    "2000 speckle images were accumulated with exposure times of 50  ms per frame in each filter , to determine the position parameters and magnitude differences .",
    "the seeing was @xmath17  arcsec but we observed both binaries through the haze and the atmospheric extinction was @xmath18  mag . as a result we were able to accumulate the signal in the power spectrum not more than @xmath19 per cent of the maximum possible level .",
    "it practically did not decrease the accuracy of angular distance @xmath20 and @xmath7 measurements , but reduced significantly that of magnitude difference @xmath21 all the more our data are not suitable to search for the presumably faint close companion xz  tau  c ( carrasco - gonzalez et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "results of our measurements and their errors are presented in table  [ bta - results ] . as can be seen from the table @xmath20 and @xmath7 values for xz  tau derived in different bands agree within errors of measurements , and so we will use later on their averaged values .",
    ".results of our speckle interferometric observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we conclude therefore that the parameters of xz  tau preliminary orbit can be described as follows : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24  au , @xmath25 yr . these values can be compared with orbital parameters of the binary published earlier : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28  au , @xmath29  yr ( krist et al . , 2008 ) ; @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32  au , @xmath33  yr ( hioki et  al . , 2009 ) .",

    "<S> the results of our speckle interferometric observations of young binaries vy  tau and xz  tau are presented . for the first time , we found a relative displacement of vy  tau components as well as a preliminary orbit for xz  tau . </S>",
    "<S> it appeared that the orbit is appreciably non - circular and is inclined by @xmath0 from the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the rotation axis of xz  tau  a and the axis of its jet are significantly non - perpendicular to the orbital plane . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the average brightness of xz  tau had been increasing from the beginning of the last century up to the mid - thirties and then it decreased by @xmath1 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal brightness has been reached significantly later on the time of periastron passage . </S>",
    "<S> the total brightness of xz  tau s components varied in a non - regular way from 1970 to 1985 when eruptions of hot gas from xz  tau  a presumably had occurred . in the early nineties the variations became regular following which a chaotic variability had renewed . </S>",
