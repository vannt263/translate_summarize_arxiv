    "understanding the phase diagram of correlated quantum many - body systems , that is , the different types of order such systems can exhibit , is one of the most important and challenging tasks on the way to a comprehensive theory of quantum many - body systems .",
    "compared to classical statistical models , quantum systems exhibit a much more complex behavior , such as phases with topological order as in the fractional quantum hall effect , which can not be described using landau s paradigm of local symmetry breaking .    in the last years",
    ", tensor network based ansatzes , such as matrix product states  @xcite ( mps ) and projected entangled pair states  @xcite ( peps ) , have proven increasingly successful in describing ground states of quantum many - body systems .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that mps and peps can approximate ground states of gapped quantum systems efficiently :  @xcite this is , not only the ground state of systems with local order , but also , for instance , the ground states of topological insulators are well represented by those states . since mps and peps provide a characterization of quantum many - body states from a local description , they are promising candidates for a generalization of landau s theory . moreover ,",
    "they can be used to construct exactly solvable models , as every mps and peps appears as the exact ground state of an associated parent hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we apply the framework of mps and peps to the classification of gapped quantum phases by studying systems with exact mps and peps ground states . here , we define two gapped systems to be in the same phase if and only if they can be connected by a smooth path of gapped local hamiltonians .",
    "along such a path , all physical properties of the state will change smoothly , and as the system follows a quasi - local evolution ,  @xcite global properties are preserved . a vanishing gap , on the other hand ,",
    "will usually imply a discontinuous behavior of the ground state and affect global properties of the system .",
    "in addition , one can impose symmetries on the hamiltonian along the path , which in turn leads to a more refined classification of phases .    in the presence of symmetries",
    ", the above definition of gapped quantum phases can be naturally generalized to systems with symmetry breaking , i.e. , degenerate ground states , as long as they exhibit a gap above the ground state subspace . again",
    ", ground states of such systems are well approximated by mps and peps , which justifies why we study those phases by considering systems whose ground state subspace is spanned by mps and peps . on the other hand , the approach will not work for gapless phases , as the mps description typically can not be applied to them .",
    "using our framework , we obtain the following classification of quantum phases :    for one - dimensional ( 1d ) gapped systems with a unique ground state , we find that there is only a single phase , represented by the product state .",
    "imposing a constrain in form of a local symmetry @xmath0 ( with symmetry group @xmath1 ) on the hamiltonian leads to a more rich phase diagram .",
    "it can be understood from the way in which the symmetry acts on the virtual level of the mps , @xmath2 , where the @xmath3 are projective representations of @xmath4 . in particular , different phases under a symmetry are labelled by the different equivalence classes of projective representations @xmath3 of the symmetry group @xmath4 ,  @xcite which are in one - to - one correspondence to the elements of its second cohomology group @xmath5 ( this has been previously studied in ref .  ) .    for one - dimensional gapped systems with degenerate ground states , we find that in the absence of symmetries , all systems with the same ground state degeneracy can be transformed into another along a gapped adiabatic path . in order to make these degeneracies stable against perturbations ,",
    "symmetries need to be imposed on the hamiltonian .",
    "we find that any such symmetry decomposes into two parts , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "here , @xmath6 acts by permuting the symmetry broken ground states of the system . to describe @xmath7 ,",
    "choose a `` reference '' ground state , and let @xmath8 be the subgroup for which @xmath9 acts trivially on the reference state : then , @xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) is a unitary symmetry of the reference state , which again acts on the virtual level as @xmath11 , with @xmath12 a projective representation of @xmath13 .",
    "together , @xmath6 and @xmath7 form an induced representation .",
    "the different phases of the system are then labelled both by the permutation action @xmath6 of @xmath0 on the symmetry broken ground states ( or alternatively by the subgroup @xmath8 for which @xmath9 leaves the reference state invariant ) , and by the equivalence classes of projective representations @xmath12 of @xmath13 .",
    "our classification of phases is robust with respect to the definition of the gap : two systems which are within the same phase can be connected by a path of hamiltonians which is gapped even in the thermodynamic limit ; conversely , along any path interpolating between systems in different phases the gap closes already for any ( large enough ) finite chain . on the other hand , we demonstrate that the classification of phases is very sensitive to the way in which the symmetry constraints are imposed , and we present various alternative definitions , some of which yield more fine - grained classifications , while others result in the same classification as without symmetries .",
    "in particular , we also find that phases under symmetries are not stable under taking multiple copies , and thus should not be regarded a resource in the quantum information sense .",
    "parts of our results can be generalized to two dimensions ( 2d ) , with the limitation that we can only prove gaps of parent hamiltonians associated with peps in restricted regions .",
    "these regions include systems with unique ground states and with local symmetry breaking as well as topological models .",
    "we show that within those regions , these models label different quantum phases , with the product state , ising hamiltonians , and kitaev s double models  @xcite as their representatives .",
    "we also find that in these regions , imposing symmetries on the hamiltonian does not alter the phase diagram , and , more generally , that symmetry constraints on two- and higher - dimensional systems must arise from a different mechanism than in one dimension .    as a main tool for our proofs , we introduce a new standard form for mps and peps which we call the _",
    "isometric form_. isometric forms are renormalization fixed points which capture the relevant features of the quantum state under consideration , both for mps and for the relevant classes of peps .",
    "parent hamiltonians of mps can be transformed into their isometric form along a gapped path , which provides a way to renormalize the system without actually blocking sites .",
    "this reduces the classification of quantum phases to the classification of phases for isometric mps / peps and their parent hamiltonians , which is considerably easier to carry out due to its additional structure .",

    "it follows that for any such peps , a symmetry can be understood at the virtual level as @xmath328 where again the @xmath6 permutes the sectors , the @xmath240 are minimal subsets invariant under @xmath6 , and the @xmath233 and @xmath253 , together with @xmath6 , form an induced projective representation .",
    "the permutation action @xmath6 of the symmetry is invariant under blocking .",

    "if moreover the @xmath6 are equal , we can construct an interpolating path of peps just as in one dimension .",
    "in this section , we discuss various aspects which have been omitted in the previous sections .        in order to obtain injectivity ,",
    "it is necessary to block sites ( say , @xmath22 sites per block ) .",
    "thus , the notion of locality changes : for instance , a two - local path of parent hamiltonians is @xmath329-local on the unblocked system .",
    "also , along such a path we can maintain translational invariance only under translations by @xmath22 sites , i.e. , on the blocked system .    however , the number of sites which need to be blocked to obtain injectivity is fairly small , namely @xmath330 for typical cases  @xcite and @xmath331 in the worst case .",

    "it is not clear whether we can construct interpolating paths without reaching injectivity of @xmath20 : while we can move to isometric @xmath20 along gapped paths , the structure of those isometric points is now much more rich ; for instance , the aklt projector is of that form .",
    "also , certain alternative definitions of phases under symmetries ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion : def - of - phases ] ) behave differently under translational invariance .",
    "finally , in the case of symmetry broken systems , imposing translational invariance can result in _ projective _ representations as physical symmetries ( this is discussed in sec .  [",

    "the effect of symmetries in this language can be written as follows : eq .",

    "while the matrix formalism using the @xmath332 s is more common , we choose the projector formulation since we believe it is more suitable for the purposes of this paper ( with the exception of describing the block structure in the non - injective case ) : the @xmath20 , or parts of it , are the maps which we use to conjugate the hamiltonian with to get to the isometric form , and which we conjugate the @xmath0 with to obtain the effective action of the symmetry on the bonds .",
    "also , in this formulation the isometric point is characterized simply by maximally entangled pairs with @xmath338 symmetry , rather than by an mps with kronecker delta tensors , and is thus more intuitive to deal with .",
    "there are other definitions of quantum phases : for instance , instead of gappedness one can ask for a path of hamiltonians along which the ground states do not change abruptly .",
    "one can also right away consider the ground states instead of the hamiltonian and ask whether two states can be transformed into each other using ( approximately ) local transformations .",
    "@xcite both these definitions are implied by ours : the existence of a gapped path implies that the ground states change smoothly , cf .",
    "( [ eq : inj - sym : gs - smooth ] ) , and using quasi - adiabatic continuation,@xcite any gapped path of hamiltonians yields a quasi - local transformation between the ground states.@xcite      in our definition of phases , we allowed to compare systems with different local hilbert space dimension .",
    "one way to think of this is to consider the smaller system as being embedded in the larger system .",
    "a more flexible way is to allow for the use of ancillas to extend the local hilbert space .",
    "in fact , these ancillas are automatically obtained when blocking : recall that we restricted our attention to the subspace actually used by @xmath20 ; the remaining degrees of freedom ( if sufficiently many to allow for a tensor product structure ) can be used to construct ancillas .",
    "an explicit way to do so is to block two isometric tensors together : the state now contains a maximally entangled pair @xmath125 ( correlated to the ghz in the non - injective case ) which can be considered as a @xmath126dimensional ancilla system .",
    "note that we can , in the same way , obtain ancillas for systems with symmetries : after blocking three isometric sites , the maximally entangled states in the middle are invariant under @xmath339 .",
    "since also two maximally entanged states between sites @xmath340 and @xmath341 are invariant under that symmetry , the symmetry acts trivially on this two - dimensional subspace which thus constitutes an ancilla qubit not subject to the symmetry action .        when defining phases under symmetries , we have allowed for arbitrary representations of the symmetry group along the path .",
    "what if we want to restrict to only the representation of the initial and final symmetry , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ?",
    "it turns out that does not pose a restriction for compact groups , as long as at least one of the effective representations @xmath65 or @xmath66 after blocking to the normal form is faithful .",
    "namely , given such a faithful representation @xmath0 , we have that @xmath342|^2\\ge0 $ ] ( with @xmath343 the virtual realization of @xmath0 ) , which implies that any representation @xmath282 is contained as a subrepresentation in @xmath117 for @xmath14 large enough .",

    "thus , starting from the symmetry representation @xmath65 or @xmath66 , we can effectively obtain any representation needed for the interpolating path by blocking @xmath14 sites , proving equivalence of the two definitions .",
    "if the two systems to be compared are invariant under the same symmetry @xmath348 , we might want to build a path invariant under that symmetry , instead of considering the symmetry @xmath349 as in our definition .",
    "in fact , these two definitions turn out the be equivalent , since we can easily map a path with symmetry @xmath0 to one with symmetry @xmath348 , and vice versa . given a path @xmath350 ( with corrsponding hamiltonian ) with symmetry @xmath65 , we can add an unconstrained ancilla qubit ( cf .",
    "[ app : phasedef - ancillas ] ) at each site and consider the path @xmath351 , thus embedding the system in a space with symmetry @xmath0 .",

    "note that the factorization @xmath354 requires @xmath65 and @xmath66 to have the same phase , which motivates why we chose to lock the phase between @xmath65 and @xmath66 in such a scenario .",
    "defining phases in the presence of symmetries is suble , as different definitions can yield very different classifications . in the following ,",
    "we discuss some alternative definitions and their consequences",
    ".    one possibility would be not to allow for an arbitrary gauge of the phases of the symmetries in @xmath65 and @xmath66 , but to keep the gauge fixed . in that case",
    ", the 1d representations in ( [ eq : app - inj - sform : sform ] ) and ( [ eq : sym : noninj:2223 ] ) can enter the classification : while finite representations can be still removed by blocking sites , continuous representations remain different even after blocking and can not be changed into each other continuously , and thus , phases are additionally labelled by the continuous 1d representations of the symmetry .    this classification changes once more if one allows to compare blocks of different lengths for the two systems : e.g. , for @xmath159 any two continuous representations @xmath355 and @xmath356 of @xmath357 can be made equal by blocking @xmath358 and @xmath359 sites , respectively , as long as the signs of @xmath360 and @xmath361 are equal",
    ". therefore , in that case the phases are additionally labelled by the signs of the 1d representations ; this case has been considered in ref .  .",
    "to give an example where one might want to fix the phase relation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , consider the two product states @xmath362 and @xmath363 under @xmath364 symmetry : both @xmath65 and @xmath66 arise as subblocks of @xmath365 [ with @xmath366 the original @xmath367 representation ] , which suggests to fix the phase relation and in turn separates the two phases ; note that this can be seen as a way to reinforce translational invariance .",
    "we are now going to present an alternative definition of phases under symmetries which yields a significantly different classification , namely that all systems with the same ground state degeneracy are in the same phase , just as without symmetries .",
    "the aim of this discussion is to point out that it is important to fix the representation of the symmetry group , and not only the symmetry group itself , in order to obtain a meaningful classification of phases in the presence of symmetries .",
    "we impose that along the path , the system is invariant under some ( say , faithful ) representation of the symmetry group , which may however change along the path .",
    "then , however , it is possible to transform any state to pairs of maximally entangled states between adjacent sites in the _ same _ basis , and therefore to the same parent hamiltonian , by rotating the isometric form .",
    "thus , all injective systems can be transformed to the same hamiltonian preserving symmetries , and similarly for symmetry broken systems .",
    "it follows that even with symmetries , all systems are in the same phase as long as they have the same ground state degeneracy .",
    "note that while in our approach , we also use rotations to bring the system into a simple form , these `` rotations '' should just be thought of as choosing a convenient basis , and not as actual rotations .",
    "in particular , due to our way of imposing the two symmetry representations on orthogonal subspaces , @xmath368 , we never need to fix two different bases for the same subspace .",
    "while our definition of phases under symmetries can be applied to both linear and projective representations , we found that in the injective case , symmetries are in fact always linear ( cf .  appendix  [ app : stform - inj - sym ] ) . in the non - injective case , however , there exist systems having projective symmetries , such as the majumdar - ghosh model , which has the ground states @xmath369 and the same state translated by one lattice site .",
    "this model is invariant under @xmath370 [ which can be understood as a projective representation of @xmath371 and under the pauli matrices ( a projective representation of @xmath372 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "any @xmath373-dimensional projective representation becomes linear ( up to trivial phases ) after taking its @xmath373th power ; thus , classifying phases under linear symmetries as we did is in fact sufficient .",
    "alternatively , any projective representation can be lifted to a linear representation , which is still a symmetry of the hamiltonian : e.g. , any @xmath0invariant hamiltonian , @xmath374=0 $ ] , is also invariant under @xmath375 , and thus under the representation @xmath376 of the group @xmath377 generated by the @xmath0 by itself .    on the other hand , in case",
    "we want to build a joint symmetry representation @xmath349 _ before _ blocking , and do not want to lift the joint representation to a larger group , we get constraints on @xmath65 and @xmath66 : firstly , both of them need to be in the same cohomology class  while the cohomology class can be changed by blocking , one might want to compare systems with a particular notion of locality . also note that even if both symmetries are in the same cohomology class , one needs to adjust the trivial phases such that @xmath157 is actually equal up to a one - dimensional representation of the group , since otherwise @xmath0 does not form a representation ; note however that this is actually a consequence of our requirement that @xmath0 forms a representation and does not follows from an underlying symmetry .",
    "an interesting observation is that the classification of 1d phases under symmetries is not stable if one takes multiple copies .",
    "for instance , one can construct a path of smooth gapped hamiltonians which interpolates from two copies of the aklt state to the trivial state while preserving @xmath378 symmetry .",
    "more generally , for any two states @xmath105\\rangle}$ ] and @xmath114\\rangle}$ ] there exist @xmath379 and @xmath380 such that @xmath105\\rangle}^{\\otimes k_0}$ ] can be converted to @xmath114\\rangle}^{\\otimes k_1}$ ] .",
    "this follows from the observation made in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d - sym ] for two - dimensional systems : taking tensor products changes the projective representation on the bond , and it is always possible to obtain a linear representation by taking a finite number of copies .    from a quantum information perspective",
    ", this shows that mps which belong to different phases should not be regarded as a resource such as entanglement , but rather as characterized by conserved quantities such as parity ( i.e. , described by a finite group ) . the minimum requirement for a resource should be that it can not be created `` for free '' ( e.g. , by the quasi - local evolution created by a gapped path  @xcite ) .",
    "however , an arbitrary even number of copies of the aklt state can be created from one trivial state , which demonstrates that phases under symmetries should not be considered resources .",
    "while we have discussed the classification of phases for local symmetries @xmath117 , very similar ideas can be used to classify phases under global symmetries such as inversion or time reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite the fundamental concept  that two @xmath20 representing the same mps or peps are related by a gauge transformation",
    " equally applies in the case of global symmetries .",
    "however , it should be noted that there is an essential difference , in that the representation structure of the global symmetry need not lead to a representation structure on the virtual level , which in turn leads to classification criteria beyond cohomology classes .",
    "let us illustrate this for reflection symmetry : reflection is realized by applying a flip ( swap ) operator @xmath381 to the _ virtual _ system , together with an operation @xmath382 on the physical system reversing the ordering of the blocked sites .",

    "this relation allows for phases @xmath390 , corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric unitaries @xmath384 , which can not be connected continuously and thus label different phases ; this observation has been used in refs .   to prove the separation of the aklt phase from the trivial phase under either time reversal or inversion symmetry .        as an example for the classification of one - dimensional phases in the presence of symmetries , let us discuss the different phases under @xmath372 symmetry , which appears e.g.  as a subsymmetry of @xmath378 invariant models",

    "imposing local symmetries leads to a more refined classification : for systems with unique ground states , different phases are labelled by equivalence classes of projective representations , this is , cohomology classes of the group ; for systems with degenerate ground states , we found that the symmetry action can be understood as composed of a permutation ( permuting the symmetry broken ground states ) and a representation of a subgroup ( acting on the individual ground states ) , which together form an induced representation , and different phases are labelled by the permutation action ( this is , the subgroup ) and the cohomology classes of the subgroup . in this classification ,",
    "systems in the same phase can be connected along a path which is gapped even in the thermodynamic limit , while for systems in different phases , the gap along any interpolating path will close even for a finite chain .",
    "we have subsequently studied two - dimensional systems and considered three classes of phases , namely product states , ghz states , and topological models based on quantum doubles .",
    "we have shown that all of these phases are stable in some region , and demonstrated that within that region , and more generally within the framework used for mps , imposing symmetries does not further constrain the phase diagram .",
    "we have also compared different definitions of phases under symmetries and found that very different classifications can be obtained depending on the definition chosen , ranging from scenarios where symmetries do nt affect the classification at all , to scenarios where the classification is more fine - grained and e.g.  the one - dimensional representations of the group partly or fully enter the classification . in this context , it is interesting to note that there is a hierarchy in the classification of phases as the spatial dimension increases : zero - dimensional phases are labelled by 1d representations of the symmetry group ( this is , its first cohomology group ) .",
    "this label vanishes in one dimension , and phases are now classified by the second cohomology group .",
    "this label , in turn , vanishes in three dimensions , and although we have demonstrated that we ca nt infer symmetry constraints from the continuity of the peps projectors @xmath20 alone , it is expected that phases under symmetries in two and more dimensions are still classified by higher order cohomology groups .",
