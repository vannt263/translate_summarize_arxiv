    "the solutions shows that due to friction , the pressure of a dust cloud at the boundary of the cavity behind the projectile can become negative , which entails the formation of a microscopic void free from dust particles , i.e. , the cavity deformation .",

    "note that for arbitrary acceleration ( assuming @xmath54 ) , one can introduce the effective damping rate @xmath55 which can have either sign , so that the critical cosine @xmath56 can have either sign as well .",

    "the critical velocity @xmath58 calculated above defines the emergence of a point or circle of zero pressure on the cavity surface depending on the value of @xmath59 .",
    "it is well - known in gas dynamics that the existence of small local regions of negative pressure would not lead to a significant deformation of flow lines and , therefore , to a stall .",

    "there does not seem to be any criterion that would tell us how large the negative region should be to initiate a stall .",
    "nevertheless , one can hope that the velocity @xmath58 derived above provides a reasonable lower bound estimate for the cavity deformation onset . strictly speaking ,",
