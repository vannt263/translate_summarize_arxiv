    "magmatic liquids are the principal agents of mass and heat transfer in the earth and terrestrial planets and intensive research has been accomplished to understand the processes of mass or energy transfer with respect to melt or structural properties @xcite .",
    "viscosity , thermal or electrical conductivity are indeed directly related to the structure of silicate melts which furthermore control the temperature behavior of magmas and their formation or crystallization @xcite .    in this context , calcium silicates of chemical formula",
    "@xmath0 have received little attention as compared to the corresponding alkaline systems so that much of their properties over the whole calcium glass formation range are still object of active research .",
    "most studies have indeed focused on the @xmath2 molar concentration which corresponds to the crystalline wollastonite composition @xcite .",
    "several studies have stressed the special role played by the calcium atom which acts as a modifier in the silicate networks @xcite and leads to a global increase of the density from @xmath3 at @xmath4 to @xmath5 at the @xmath6 pyrosilicate composition @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been performed to understand the miscibility limits in this system and in other alkaline earth silicates @xcite .",
    "a special attention has been devoted to the coordination number of the calcium atom using exafs @xcite and x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "more recently , yannopoulos and co - workers have been studying inelastic light scattering of calcium silicates around the @xmath2 composition by polarized raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the results with composition show a marked change in behavior around @xmath7 calcium . specifically , intensity ratios of particular raman lines as well as the boson peak frequency present a sharp jump at this concentration . on the other hand",
    ", a line at @xmath8 shows an abrupt increase but there remain some uncertainety about its attribution to the so - called @xmath9 ring line @xcite .",
    "however , the conclusion obviously suggests the presence of a transition that has not been characterized by the authors .    in this work ,",
    "we show from the investigation of raman spectroscopy that a very particular elastic state is reached in the glass when the concentration of calcium @xmath1 equals @xmath7 .",
    "this threshold is identified with a rigid to floppy transition from maxwell mechanical constraint counting and suggests that elastic transitions can take place in calcium silicate glasses as in chalcogenides @xcite . in the latter , the addition of cross - linking units such as germanium or silicon into a basic network made of two - folded chalcogenide atoms ( sulphur , selenium ) constraints indeed internal degrees of freedom of the network by increasing the number of bond - bending and bond - stretching forces that can lead to a very peculiar situation when the number of constraints per atom equals the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it has been identified by m.f .",
    "thorpe from numerical simulations on amorphous silicon as being a floppy to rigid transition which is characterized by the vanishing of the number of normal ( floppy ) modes of the dynamical matrix @xcite .",
    "the glass transition of such systems undergoing a rigid to floppy transition is also substantially affected @xcite .",
    "understanding to what extent the methods used with success for the chalcogenides can be applied to oxide glasses is therefore not only of fundamental interest but also an attractive perspective for applied purposes @xcite .",
    "we first display the results of the raman analysis and the deconvolution of the spectra which show a marked change in behaviour for some modes at @xmath10 .",
    "next , we apply on this system mean - field maxwell mechanical constraint counting that permits to compute the concentration @xmath11 at which the fraction of zero frequency ( floppy ) modes vanishes @xcite .",
    "we improve the approach in section iv by analyzing the present system with size increasing cluster approximations ( sica ) that infer the effect of medium - range order on the nature and the location of the transition which is found to be in harmony with experimental findings .",
    "finally , we show which conditions in terms of medium range order have to be satisfied in order to obtain an intermediate self - organized phase @xcite that is bounded by a rigidity and a stress transition @xcite , in close correspondance with the chalcogen analog .",
    "the samples were prepared by mixing pre - dried @xmath12 ( 99.99 @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( 99.95 @xmath13 ) powders in the correct proportions . for each sample , the mixture was melted in a platinum crucible at @xmath15c for two hours , and quenched by placing the bottom of the crucible in cold water .",
    "the samples were then annealed at a temperature around @xmath16 for five hours and cooled slowly to room temperature .",
    "the glasses were transparent and free of crystallization as confirmed by the absence of bragg peaks in xrd spectra .",
    "chemical microanalysis using the energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) performed on optically polished glasses showed a very low departure ( less than 0.4 mol of ca ) between the theoretical and the real composition for all the studied samples .",
    "the glass transition temperatures were determined with a differential scanning calorimeter setaram dsc-1600 at a heating rate @xmath17 .",
    "these values ( see table [ table ] ) are slightly larger than those reported by shelby@xcite using the dilatometric technique , but they exhibit the same global trend    .[table ] glass transition temperatures of the @xmath18 system . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the probability of finding floppy , isostatically rigid and stressed rigid clusters can be computed for each sica step and it is found that for dendritic clusters there is a global increase of the floppy and isostatically rigid clusters with increasing ca concentration whereas the probability of stressed rigid clusters is continuously decreasing ( see figure [ probclustrando ] ) .",
    "however , no threshold is observed as the one suggested by the raman analysis and one obtains a single solution @xmath19 corresponding to the glass optimum point defined by the vanishing of the number of floppy modes .",
    "we now turn to self - organization that permits to obtain an elastic intermediate phase @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this elastic phase has been first observed by boolchand and co - workers in chalcogenides @xcite , but as rigid to floppy transitions have been also detected in oxide glasses @xcite , there is no reason why this intermediate phase should not exist in the present system as well .",
    "we consider here the strutural possibilities that can lead to an intermediate phase .",
    "it is achieved with sica by selecting the pathways of cluster production .",
    "one starts for example with a underconstrained ( floppy ) cluster of size @xmath20 which exists at high calcium concentration .",
    "agglomeration of basic units @xmath21 onto this cluster is only allowed if the creation of a stressed rigid region can be avoided on the generated cluster of size @xmath22 .",
    "this would happen if one starts to connect two @xmath23 tetrahedra together , involving an energy gain of @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath1 is decreased one will accumulate with this rule isostatically rigid regions on the generated clusters as the only allowed connections are either floppy @xmath25 or @xmath26 bondings . alternatively ,",
    "if one starts from the low calcium side , self - organization can be obtained by selecting along the same scheme stressed rigid and isostatically rigid connections and excluding systematically the possibility of floppy @xmath25 bondings in the sica construction .    with decreasing calcium content , one will be able to maintain that rule up to a certain point beyond which connections between two silicon tetrahedra ( or a stressed rigid connection ) can not be avoided anymore .",
    "the latter point corresponds to a stress transition @xcite and appears only if some medium range order ( mro ) made of rings is accepted in the construction .",
    "the concentration range bounded on its low calcium side by the stress transition and on its high calcium side by the vanishing of the number of floppy modes , defines the intermediate phase of width @xmath27 .",
    "probability of finding stressed rigid , isostatically rigid and floppy clusters as a function of calcium concentration @xmath1 .",
    "the thick solid line corresponds to the basic sica step @xmath21 and @xmath28 , the thin solid line to @xmath29 and the broken line to @xmath30 .",
    "the vertical lines define the intermediate phase of width @xmath27 at setp @xmath30 .",
    "the present situation for @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponds to self - organization with ring structures . notice the kink around @xmath31 corresponding to the stress transition ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "results of self - organization are displayed in fig .",
    "[ probcluster ] .",
    "the simplest case for self - organized clusters is again the case where rings are removed from the construction corresponding to dendritic clusters which would correspond in the limit @xmath32 to bethe lattice solutions @xcite or random bond models @xcite obtained in the context of floppy to rigid transitions .",
    "we obtain here a single transition for all sica steps @xmath20 either at the mean - field value @xmath33 or closeby ( @xmath34 for @xmath30 ) .",
    "no intermediate phase is obtained .",
    "the probabilities of floppy , isostatically rigid and stressed rigid clusters can be displayed as a function of calcium content ( fig .",
    "[ probcluster ] ) and show that the abundance of isostatically rigid clusters is maximum at the threshold defined by @xmath19 .",
    "this is obviously the case for the @xmath28 case , but also for larger sica steps .",
    "width of the intermediate phase at step @xmath30 in @xmath18 glasses , as a function of the fraction of medium range order ( rings ) computed at @xmath2 .",
    "the insert represents the computed number of floppy modes for step @xmath29 ( solid line ) and @xmath30 ( broken line ) . ]",
    "the intermediate phase shows up if a certain amount of medium range order ( mro ) is allowed .",
    "this is realized in the sica construction by generating in the construction ring clusters such as the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] .",
    "the requirement of self - organization in the cluster construction still holds for dendritic stressed rigid structures made of at least two connected @xmath35 tetrehadra which propagate stress in the structure .",
    "but now cyclic structures such as rings are preserved from self - organization .",
    "two transitions are obtained for every sica steps @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ probcluster ] .",
    "the first transition one lies always around the concentration @xmath37 calcium and corresponds to a rigidity transition where the number of floppy modes vansihes .",
    "the second transition that emerges with increasing mro is located for @xmath30 at @xmath38 and corresponds to the stress transition .",
    "when starting from a floppy network at high calcium concentration , the progressive stiffening of the network can be accomplished by requirement of self - organization leading to the accumulation of isostatically rigid regions and stressed rigid ring structures .",
    "this will work for any decreasing @xmath1 up to @xmath39 below which stressed rigid bondings outside of ring structures can not be avoided anymore .",
    "the two transitions @xmath40 and @xmath39 will define an intermediate phase @xmath27 that depends on the fraction of mro allowed and we show that @xmath27 is anincreasing function of the mro ( fig [ width ] ) . furthermore , as the rigidity transition @xmath19 at @xmath39 is almost not affected by the presence of mro , the increase of the width with the latter quantity arises mostly from the decrease of @xmath40 with growing mro . finally , as seen from fig .",
    "[ probcluster ] , there is kink observable at @xmath40 which would produce in first - order derivatives such as the energy @xcite a jump suggesting a first - order stress transition at @xmath40 @xcite,@xcite and a continuous rigidity transition at@xmath39 .    the elastic nature of the network can be also analyzed within this framework .",
    "[ probcluster ] , one can see that the probability of finding isostatically rigid clusters is maximum in the window @xmath27 .",
    "it is equal to 1 for the @xmath28 sica step and about @xmath41 or @xmath42 for the larger steps thus providing evidence that the molecular structure of the network in the window is almost stress - free .",
    "we have shown in the present work from raman measurements that a particular transition was observed at around @xmath7 calcium in the calcium silicate system , in harmony with previous findings @xcite .",
    "we have elucidated the origin of the observed threshold as being the manifestation of a global softening of the glass structure that signals ultimately in a rigid to floppy transition .",
    "constraint counting algorithms applied on size increasing clusters permit to refine the picture by predicting the possibility of an intermediate phase in the raman threshold region .",
    "recent calorimetric and spectroscopic studies have shown that this kind of elastic transitions could be found in alkaline silicates as well , with a well - defined signature of the intermediate phase in both sodium @xcite and potassium glasses @xcite .",
    "we are confident that a similar generic behaviour should be expected in the alkaline earth silicate glasses .",
    "a definite probe of the existence of the intermediate phase in the present system could be obtained using mdsc measurements during the glass transition .",
    "the results present always a vanishing of the kinetic dependent heat flow inside that phase @xcite and provide an unambigous signature for both transitions , rigidity and stress .",
    "unfortunately , the glass transition temperatures of calcium silicates are too high to be accepted from the actual performances of the mdsc apparatus@xcite .",
    "discussion and comments with p. boolchand are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we thank emmanule veron for the edx analysis and boris robert for help during the cours of this work .",
