    "the longstanding issue of the distance and absolute luminosity of grbs has been settled in the past decade through the observational evidence collected by @xmath4 ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ) and @xmath5 ( costa et al . 1997 ) , while the theoretical work of mszros & rees ( 1992 ) and rees & mszros ( 1992 ) provided the broader physical framework into which these events seem to generally fit .",
    "this framework associates grbs with radiation emitted by relativistic blast waves ( hereafter rbws ) , produced by an unspecified todate agent , presumably associated with the formation of a neutron star or black hole .",
    "while the source of the energy associated with grbs has remained uncertain , there remains little doubt about the presence of the rbws , which power also the later time emissions at x - ray , optical and radio frequencies , known collectively as grb afterglows ( see review of piran 1999 ) .    with the discovery of grb afterglows , much of the theoretical activity has since shifted to the study of the physics of these later time emissions .",
    "nonetheless , a number of issues associated with the prompt -ray emission , besides the nature of their energy source , still remain open .",
    "chief among them are the conversion of the rbw kinetic energy into radiation and the fact that the frequency at which the grb luminosity peaks , @xmath6 , is narrowly distributed around a value intriguingly close to the electron rest mass energy .",
    "the purpose of the present note is to describe a process that provides a  natural \" account of these generic , puzzling grb features .",
    "following the work of shemi & piran ( 1990 ) it has been generally accepted that a certain amount of baryons must be carried off with the blast waves responsible for the grbs .",
    "this baryon contamination has even been deemed necessary , else the entire blast wave internal energy would be converted into radiation on very short time scales , leading to events of very different temporal and spectral appearance ( e.g. paczyski 1986 ) than observed in grbs . while the low radiative efficiency of baryons is essential for the grb energy transport to the requisite distances ( @xmath7 cm ) , it becomes problematic when demanded that their internal energy be radiated away on the short time scales associated with the grb prompt -ray emission .",
    "generally , this issue is sidestepped by appealing to an unknown process which transfers the proton energy into electrons ( dermer , bttcher & chiang 1999 ) , whose radiative evolution could then be accurately computed .",
    "the narrow range of the grb @xmath8 spectral peak energy , @xmath6 , is another well documented systematic feature of these events , a result of the extensive data base accumulated by @xmath4 .",
    "the compilation of malozzi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) shows clearly a preference for an energy @xmath9 kev at which the @xmath8 grb spectra exhibit a maximum .",
    "in fact , it is precisely this maximum in the spectral energy distribution that qualifies grbs as such .",
    "furthermore , when corrected for the redshift ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath6 shifts close to the electron rest mass .",
    "while a compelling explanation of this fact is presently lacking , several accounts have occasionally been proposed .",
    "for example , brainerd ( 1994 ) argues that this is the result of down - comptonization of a power law photon distribution that extends to @xmath11 mev by cold matter with thompson depth @xmath12 , an explanation possibly in conflict with the timing properties of grbs ( see e.g. kazanas , titarchuk and hua 1997 ) .",
    "the association of the grb emission with relativistically boosted synchrotron radiation from rbws has made this particular issue far more acute , as the energy of the latter should scale like @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , even very small variations in the values of   would lead to a very broad range in the values of @xmath6 .",
    "dermer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed that the observed distribution is the result of the time evolution of a blast wave with a specific baryon loading , which when convolved with the triggering criteria of existing detectors favors the detection of fireballs with @xmath6 in the observed range .",
    "on the other hand , on the basis of analysis of smm data , harris & share ( 1999 ) have argued that there is no apparent excess of grbs with @xmath14 mev , thus leaving this issue open .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : in  2 we outline the fundamental notion behind our proposal for converting the rbw proton energy into radiation , we derive the associated necessary conditions and discuss its relation to grb phenomenology . in ",
    "3 we produce model spectra based on this proposal and indicate their relation to the particular value of @xmath6 observed .",
    "finally , in  4 the results are discussed and certain conclusions are drawn .",
    "the process described herein has been discussed in the past by kazanas & mastichiadis ( 1999 ; hereafter km99 ) in the context of agn , where arguments have been put forward in favor of a hadronic origin of the relativistic electrons in blazars .",
    "this process is effectively the relativistic plasma instability proposed by kirk & mastichiadis ( 1992 ; hereafter km92 ) coupled to the increase in the photon energy associated with relativistically moving  mirrors \" ( ghisellini & madau 1997 ) .",
    "while the mathematical formulation of the instability is given in detail in the above references , we provide below a qualitative re - derivation which focuses on and elucidates the underlying physics .",
    "consider a spherical volume of size @xmath15 , containing a relativistic proton plasma of differential spectrum @xmath16 (   being the proton lorentz factor ) , along with an ( infinitesimal ) number of photons of energy @xmath17 ( in units of @xmath18 ) ; these photons can produce pairs via the @xmath19 reaction , provided that the proton population extends to lorentz factors @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath22 , the pairs ( of lorentz factor also equal to @xmath23 ) produce synchrotron photons of energy @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnetic field in units of the critical one @xmath26 g.    for the reaction network to be _ self - contained _ the energies of the seed and synchrotron photons should be equal , yielding the kinematic threshold of the process i.e. @xmath27 . for the process to be also _ self - sustained _ , at least one of the synchrotron photons must produce a pair before exiting the volume of the source . hence , the optical depth of the source to the @xmath19 reaction should be greater than @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the total number of synchrotron photons produced by an electron of energy @xmath23 .",
    "this condition then reads @xmath30 . eliminating @xmath23 using the kinematic threshold condition @xmath31",
    ", the critical column density expression reduces to @xmath32 which ( within factors of order unity ) is the condition derived in km92 .",
    "this condition is similar to that of the criticality of a nuclear pile , except that there one deals with neutrons rather than photons ( this similarity carries also over in the case in the comptonization of photons by hot electrons ( katz 1976 ) ) .",
    "it becomes apparent , hence , that the critical quantity here ( as also in a nuclear pile ) is the column density ( rather than the mass , the term  critical mass \" being simply a figure of speech ) .",
    "the pair - synchrotron photon - proton - pair network will be self - sustained if the column density is equal to the critical one . for larger values",
    "the number of pairs increases exponentially , eventually leading to a depletion of the available energy source on time scales @xmath33 ( a bomb ! ) .",
    "km99 extended the above analysis to the case that the relativistic proton containing plasma moves itself relativistically with lorentz factor .",
    "the criticality conditions change quantitatively if the radiation emitted by the plasma can be  reflected \" by matter located along its direction of motion .",
    "due to relativistic beaming , essentially all the photons produced internally in the plasma will be focused in the forward direction , reflected and boosted in energy , upon their re - interception by the moving plasma , by a factor @xmath34",
    ". if @xmath35 is the ( normalized ) value of the comoving magnetic field , the synchrotron photons of energy @xmath36 will , upon their re - interception , have energy @xmath37 , modifying the kinematic threshold condition to @xmath38 .",
    "the change in the kinematic threshold affects also the dynamic one : the photons necessary for the production of pairs in the comoving frame are now emitted by electrons of lorentz factor only @xmath39 .",
    "the number of such photons is now @xmath40 .",
    "demanding again that the column of the plasma be greater than @xmath28 , along with the new threshold relation , leads to the condition @xmath41 namely the condition derived in km99 ( @xmath42 are the co - moving source size and density ) .",
    "relativistic motion therefore , eases significantly the ",
    "criticality \" condition in the case of a relativistically moving plasma .",
    "the situation in the rbw of a grb is somewhat different than that discussed just above .",
    "though diffusive acceleration is very likely present in their associated shocks , the mere postshock isotropization of the flow creates , in the rbw frame , a relativistic population of protons with mean energy @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , to be most conservative , one could dispense with the requirement of an accelerated proton population and demand that _ only _ the protons of energy @xmath44 be present ( these are certainly the most numerous ) .",
    "therefore , upon setting @xmath45 , the kinematic threshold condition reduces to @xmath46 .",
    "the number of photons emitted by electrons at threshold then becomes @xmath47 and the  criticality \" threshold reads @xmath48 with the last relation incorporating both the kinematic and dynamic threshold ( @xmath49 due to the lorentz invariance of the column density . in this case , the quantity @xmath50 simply denotes the amount of ambient matter per unit area swept by the rbw ) . for the typical values of @xmath51 and @xmath15 used in association with grbs , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 cm and considering that @xmath54 @xmath55 , the criticality condition yields @xmath56 , values well within the accepted parameter range .    following the above analysis",
    ", the correlation between quiescence and activity periods in grbs found by ramirez - ruiz & merloni ( 2000 ) , finds a direct , qualitative interpretation : a rbw sweeps and ` piles - up ' the ambient medium behind its forward shock , whose column density increases from below to above its critical value .",
    "provided that the proper  mirror \" is located upstream , the internal energy , or part of it depending on conditions , will be explosively converted into radiation .",
    "the energy released then would be proportional to the amount of matter accumulated during quiescence , with the process repeating as the blast wave progresses and more matter is accumulated .",
    "generally , the light curves as well as the grb spectra are highly variable . in the present model ,",
    "the issue of variability becomes even more complex than in more conventional models , given that the injection rate of relativistic pairs depends on proton collisions with photons emitted at prior times , following their reflection by the  mirror \" .",
    "while the computation of the spectra within this model is an inherently time dependent problem , we present herein a simplified , steady - state treatment whose salient features , we believe , will be preserved in a more detailed calculation .",
    "we consider a rbw of energy @xmath57 erg in a uniform medium of density @xmath58 and of a ( normalized ) opening half angle @xmath59 . because of the relativistic focusing of radiation ,",
    "we need only consider a section of the blast wave of opening half angle @xmath60 .",
    "the shocked electrons of the ambient medium ( and pairs from the @xmath61 process ) produce synchrotron photons of energy @xmath62 .",
    "these , upon their scattering by the  mirror \" and re - interception by the rbw , are boosted to energy @xmath63 ( in the rbw frame ) .",
    "these photons will then be scattered by ( a ) electrons of @xmath64 , originally contained in the rbw and/or cooled since the explosion , and ( b ) by the hot ( @xmath65 ) , recently shocked ones to produce inverse compton ( ic ) radiation at energies correspondingly @xmath66 and @xmath67 at the rbw frame . at the lab frame ,",
    "the energies of these three components , i.e. @xmath68 will be higher by roughly a factor , i.e. they will be respectively at energies @xmath69 and @xmath70 . assuming that the process operates near its kinematic threshold , @xmath71 ,",
    "at the lab frame these components will be at energies @xmath72 , @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 10 gev @xmath75 .",
    "this model therefore , produces  naturally \" a component in the @xmath8 spectral distribution which peaks in the correct energy range .",
    "it also predicts the existence of another component at an energy @xmath34 higher ; such high energy emission has been observed from several grbs ( dingus 1995 ) .",
    "the relative importance of these components depends on the specifics of a given source .",
    "for the two ic components this depends on the ratio of the scattering depths of the cool @xmath76 and hot @xmath77 electrons . at a minimum , this ratio is equal to the ratio of their escape to cooling rates @xmath78 . if @xmath79 ) is the magnetic energy density ( @xmath80 denotes departures from equipartition ; @xmath81 in grbs ) , then @xmath82 and @xmath83 so that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a multiplicative factor indicating the contribution of cold electrons inherent in the rbw to the scattering depth . for @xmath86",
    "one obtains for the rate of photon scattering into the two ic components @xmath87 indicating that their luminosities would be roughly equal for the fiducial values of the parameters involved .",
    "the relative luminosity between the direct synchrotron and the cold - electron scattered synchrotron photons can be estimated as follows : the number of electrons swept - up to radius @xmath15 by a section of transverse dimension @xmath88 of the rbw is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a multiplicative factor denoting the number of pairs produced in the rbw . given that each electron of energy   produces @xmath91 photons , the total number of photons produced to radius @xmath15 is @xmath92 these photons will be received in the lab frame at energy @xmath93 over a time interval @xmath94 to yield a photon flux @xmath95 it is assumed that a fraction @xmath96 of these photons will scatter at the  mirror \" and randomize producing a  layer \" of photons of width @xmath97 ( in the lab frame ; it is assumed that the  mirror \" is thinner than @xmath98 ) , density @xmath99 and thompson depth @xmath100 ( @xmath101 if near threshold i.e. for @xmath102 ) .",
    "the number of electrons to radius @xmath15 swept by the section of the rbw considered here is then @xmath103 ; hence the total number of photons scattered by the electrons upon traversing the  photon layer \" of width @xmath104 will be @xmath105 .",
    "these will be received at the lab frame over a time @xmath106 to yield a photon flux ( at energy @xmath107 ) @xmath108 suggesting that the ratio of the photon fluxes given by eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , ( 8) will be proportional to @xmath109 . for reasonable values of the source parameters one does obtain similar photon fluxes at these two energy bands ( @xmath110 ) indicating that the luminosity at @xmath111 mev is roughly @xmath34 times that at the optical band .    in figure 1 we present a sample of a spectrum obtained using the arguments discussed above . assuming the process to operate near threshold ( with no accelerated proton component ) , leads to @xmath112 function like injection of pairs ; this results in the @xmath113 spectrum of figure 1 ( which at low energies reverts to the @xmath114 spectrum of thin synchrotron ) .",
    "clearly more involved spectra will result if particle acceleration is also incorporated in these models ; however , this will be the subject of future work .",
    "we have presented above a novel model for the prompt emission of grbs . we believe that this model provides some of the missing physics between the rbw proposal , which describes successfully the grb energetics and time scales and the prompt emission of radiation ( -ray as well as optical - uv ) , by a well defined mechanism for tapping the kinetic energy stored in the rbw baryonic component .",
    "furthermore , the same physics employed in effecting the conversion of baryon kinetic energy into radiation is instrumental in producing a peak in the spectral energy distribution at @xmath115 mev , thus providing a  natural \" account of this grb feature , an issue that has actually gotten even more puzzling with the advent of the rbw model for grb .",
    "in addition to this emission , the model implies the presence of -ray emission at higher energies , namely @xmath116 , a fact supported by some observations already , but which will be explored in greater depth by swift and glast , missions which will be able to test and put meaningful constraints on this specific model .",
    "one of the fundamental features of this model is the presence of the combination of kinematic and dynamic thresholds ; this combination , along with the presence or absence of the necessary  mirror \" , make the model inherently time dependent . at the same time , the kinematic threshold provides ( for the first time to our knowledge ) a regulating mechanism that puts one of the peaks in the @xmath8 distribution very close to the observed value , despite the motion of the emitting plasma with lorentz factors of several hundreds . concerning the nature of the  mirror \" we are willing to speculate here",
    "that , because the main  reflected \" component consists of the prompt synchrotron photons which are emitted at optical frequencies , one could use atomic cross - sections ( @xmath117 ) to estimate their reflected fraction @xmath96 ; values of @xmath51 , @xmath15 typical to those associated with grbs yield @xmath118 .",
    "this is a very rough estimate , because it ignores the ionization of the reflecting medium .",
    "a more detailed treatment including these effects is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we would like to thank jay norris , rob preece and brad shaffer for stimulating discussions and much information on grb phenomenology ."
