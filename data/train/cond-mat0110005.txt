    "central to the notion of topological order in 2d is the presence of vortex - like excitations with long - ranged statistical interactions@xcite . in the simplest 2d spin liquid",
    "these point - like excitations have been dubbed `` visons '' since they carry an ising or @xmath3 flux@xcite . upon transporting a spinon around a vison ,",
    "the spinon s wavefunction acquires a minus sign .",
    "a theoretical description of this long - ranged statistical interaction is most readily incorporated in the context of a gauge theory with a discrete ising symmetry , in which the visons carry the @xmath3 flux and the spinons the @xmath3 charge@xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 gauge theory can be dualized into a vortex representation , wherein the topological order follows from the notion of `` vortex pairing''@xcite .",
    "efforts to identify microscopic spin hamiltonians that might actually exhibit such topologically ordered phases have focussed on strongly frustrated 2d s=1/2 antiferromagnets . due to the `` sign problem '' these efforts have been essentially limited to exact diagonalization studies on very small lattices .",
    "nevertheless , such numerics do identify a few models which appear to be in a spin liquid phase : the kagome antiferromagnet with near neighbor interactions@xcite and a triangular lattice model with 4-spin ring exchange terms@xcite .",
    "the importance of multi - spin ring exchange processes in driving 2d fractionalization is also apparent within the @xmath3 gauge theory formulation@xcite . in an important recent development , moessner and sondhi@xcite",
    "have compellingly argued that a particular quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice is in a featureless liquid phase , closely analogous to a the desired  spin liquid \" phase of a spin hamiltonian .",
    "in this paper we re - visit the s=1/2 kagome antiferromagnet , in the presence of second and third neighbor exhange interactions . by passing to an easy - axis limit of this model , substantial analytic and numerical progress is possible both in establishing the presence of a fractionalized spin liquid and of directly analyzing it s topological properties . specifically , in the easy - axis limit we map the model exactly onto an xy hamiltonian consisting solely of a local 4-spin ring exhange interaction .",
    "since the sign of the ring exchange term is  bosonic \"  opposite to the sign obtained upon cyclically permuting four underlying s=1/2 fermions ( eg . electrons)@xcite  the hamiltonian does _ not _ suffer from a sign problem and so should be amenable to quantum monte carlo . furthermore ,",
    "if the two levels of the spin-@xmath0 on each site of the kagome lattice is reinterpreted as the presence or absence of a ( quantum ) dimer living on a bond of a triangular lattice , the model can be reinterpreted as a quantum dimer model which is very similar to that considered by moessner and sondhi@xcite , the distinction being that three , rather than one , dimers emerge from each site .",
    "this realization allows us to exploit the important work of rokhsar and kivelson@xcite who identified an exactly soluble point of a generalized square lattice quantum dimer model . with a similar generalization , our model also possesses an exact zero energy wavefunction : an equal weight superposition of all allowed spin configurations in the low energy singlet sector .",
    "we show that this wavefunction can be viewed as an exact version of the popular variational state consisting of the gutzwiller projection of a superfluid / superconductor@xcite . finally , we are able to implement an exact duality transformation which enables us to identify the operators which create both the spinon excitation and the topological vison excitation . employing the exact wave function ,",

    "this generalized kagome antiferromagnet can be cast into a simple form : @xmath13 where the summation is over all hexagons on the kagome lattice and @xmath14 is the sum of the six spins on each hexagon .",

    ", still characterized , however , by the good quantum numbers @xmath30 .",
    "some properties of this easy - axis limit are immediately evident . for instance , all states in the low - energy manifold have @xmath30 for every hexagon , and there is a large gap of approximately @xmath20 to states with any non - zero @xmath31 .",
    "hence the ground state has in this sense a `` spin gap '' .",
    "thus the easy - axis generalized kagome antiferromagnet has no xy spin order , but translational symmetry breaking is not precluded .",
    "more subtle aspects of this model are less evident . in particular , we would like to ascertain the presence or absence of more subtle `` topological '' order , and the types of `` singlet '' ( more precisely @xmath32 ) and spinful ( @xmath33 ) excitations .",
    "to proceed , we treat @xmath34 as a perturbation with @xmath35 , and project back into this _ low energy manifold _ of degenerate classical ground states with @xmath36 .",
    "( this procedure is very much analogous to the derivation of the heisenberg model starting from the hubbard model with @xmath37 .",

    "because this trivial shift does not split the extensive degeneracy , we neglect it in what follows .",
    "more interesting are off - diagonal processes , in which two pairs of antiparallel spins on opposite sites of a 5-site  bow - tie \" plaquette exchange ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "this process involves spins on only four sites , and is an analog of electron exchange `` ring '' moves .",
    "one can readily verify that such `` ring '' moves on the bow - tie leave invariant the ( @xmath27-axis ) magnetization on every hexagon .",
    "up to second order in @xmath42 , within the low - energy manifold , the full kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet is thereby reduced to the form : @xmath43 with @xmath44 where the labels @xmath10 denote the four spins at the ends of each bowtie as labeled in fig .  [",

    "the ring exchange interaction @xmath45 , and by assumption one has @xmath46 .",
    "it is noteworthy that in this extreme easy - axis limit the frustrated kagome magnet does _ not _ have a sign problem , and as such could be profitably attacked via quantum monte carlo .",
    "we now use @xmath47 to address the nature of the spin - gapped state of the easy - axis generalized kagome antiferromagnet .",
    "several arguments point to a spin - liquid phase which supports fractionalized `` spinon '' excitations which carry spin @xmath1 .",
    "such a fractionalized state must also support vortex - like excitations , dubbed `` visons '' , which carry no spin but have a long - ranged statistical interaction with spinons .",
    "a first suggestion to this effect comes from viewing @xmath48 as a lattice boson model , and a spin liquid state thereby as a bosonic mott insulator .",
    "generally , such bosonic insulating states can be regarded as quantum - mechanical condensates of vortices@xcite . to examine the vortex excitations , it is convenient to think of @xmath49 as lattice boson raising and lowering operators",
    ". formally , one may then express @xmath50  fluctuations in the @xmath51 phases @xmath52 ( conjugate to @xmath53 ) are induced by the constraint @xmath54 .",
    "it is then illuminating to re - express the bosonic ring term as @xmath55 consider now a vortex centered on some site ( the `` core '' ) .",
    "classically , for the four sites on the bow - tie surrounding the vortex core , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the number of vortices ( vorticity ) on this plaquette .",
    "the ( core ) energy of this vortex configuration is proportional to @xmath58 notice that plaquettes with an odd number of vortices , @xmath57 , cost an energy @xmath59 relative to the even-@xmath57 plaquettes . in particular ,",
    "a single strength vortex is costly , but double - strength vortices are cheap .",
    "the same conclusion can be shown more formally using an exact duality transformation .",
    "typically single strength vortices condense , but one can also imagine insulating states which result from a condensation of composites made from @xmath57 vortices@xcite .",
    "such insulators are necessarily fractionalized since they support deconfined ( but gapped ) charge excitations with `` boson charge '' @xmath60 . based on the energetics of the ring term which tends to expel single vortices with double vortices being energetically cheaper",
    ", one expects that the insulating state for the kagome ring model will have spin @xmath1 excitations  if it is fractionalized at all .",
    "if fractionalized , the `` vison '' can be understood as an unpaired vortex state in the vortex - pair condensate , a `` dual '' analog of a bcs quasiparticle .",
    "further evidence that the ground state of this model might be fractionalized comes from its formal equivalence to a particular quantum dimer model .",
    "mapping to a dimer model is straightforward since the sites of the kagome lattice can be viewed as the centers of the links of a triangular lattice .",
    "the two @xmath61 states on a site correspond to the presence ( or absence ) of a dimer on the associated link on the triangular lattice .",
    "the ring term above corresponds directly to the elementary quantum - dimer move on the triangular lattice considered recently by sondhi and moessner@xcite .",
    "the only difference with the standard dimer model is that in this instance there are _ three _ dimers coming out of every site of the triangular lattice instead of the usual one .",
    "sondhi and moessner considered an additional  diagonal \" term ( see below ) in the triangular lattice quantum dimer model , and argued that the model was in a spin liquid state in portions of the phase diagram .",
    "central to their argument was an exactly soluble point of the model , first exploited by rokhsar and kivelson ( rk)@xcite in the square lattice quantum dimer model .",
    "the additional term is diagonal in @xmath62 , and may be written @xmath63 , where @xmath64    the operator @xmath65 is a projection operator onto the two flippable states of the bow - tie ring @xmath66 .",
    "this term in the hamiltonian can be combined with @xmath67 and written in the suggestive form : @xmath68    when @xmath69 one can write down exact ground state(s ) which have the product of @xmath70 equalling one on all bow - tie rings .",
    "one such state is the @xmath71 ferromagnet with @xmath72 on every site . in the hard - core boson description",
    ", this corresponds to a superfluid state ( albeit an unusual one with no zero - point fluctuations ) .",
    "one must project back into the subspace in which there are three bosons on every hexagon ( @xmath30 ) , since otherwise this state will not be an eigenstate of @xmath26 .",
    "( actually , several distinct projections are generally possible , onto different sectors disconnected from one another under the action of @xmath73 .",
    "these give degenerate ground states . )",
    "this projection of a superfluid wavefunction to obtain a bosonic insulating state is analogous to the gutzwiller projections of superconducting wavefunctions to obtain variational states for quantum spin models@xcite , but there is an important difference . in the present instance",
    ", the constraints ( of 3 bosons on every hexagon ) _ commute _ with the hamiltonian @xmath67 which hops the bosons , in contrast to the no - double occupancy constraint which does not commute with the electron kinetic energy term in hubbard type models .",
    "thus , in our case the wave function after projection is still an exact eigenstate of the full hamiltonian .",
    "before studying this wave function , it is convenient to expose the vison degrees of freedom via a duality transformation . specifically , we will employ the standard @xmath74 dimensional ising duality which connects a global spin model to a @xmath3 gauge theory with gauge fields living on the links of the dual lattice@xcite . in our case",

    "[ fig : dice ] . on the operator level ,",
    "the duality transformation is implemented by re - expressing @xmath76 and @xmath77 directly in terms of the dual gauge fields , @xmath78 - a set of pauli matrices living on the links of the dice lattice : @xmath79 and @xmath80    here , the first product is taken around an elementary four - sided plaquette on the dice lattice which surrounds the spin @xmath81 .",
    "the second product involves an infinte string which connects sites of the kagome lattice , eminating from the site @xmath53 and running off to spatial infinity . for every bond of the dual dice lattice which is bisected by this string ,",
    "a factor of @xmath82 is present in the product . to assure that this definition is independent of the precise path taken by the string , requires imposing the constraint that the product of @xmath82 on all bonds connected to each site on the dice lattice is set equal to unity : @xmath83 where here @xmath84 labels the near - neighbor sites to @xmath85 .",
    "these local @xmath3 gauge constraints must be imposed on the hilbert space of the dual theory . in the resulting dual gauge theory ,",
    "these constraints are analogous to coulomb s law ( @xmath86 ) in conventional electromagnetism .",
    "the necessity of including the constraints can be simply seen by counting degrees of freedom : there are twice as many ( six ) bonds per unit cell on the dice lattice as sites ( three ) per unit cell on the kagome lattice , hence to maintain the physical hilbert space of the original spins ( site variables ) requires restricting the gauge fields ( bond variables ) .     over the underlying kagome sites ( centers of parallelograms , shown by solid dots ) through which the `` string '' indicated passes . in the dual variables ,",
    "this product is given by the product of blue gauge fields @xmath82 cut by the string shown .",

    "these products measure `` magnetic flux '' ( in the dual gauge fields ) through hexagons belonging to the two honeycomb sublattices .",
    "the flip term becomes , @xmath88 where the product is taken over pairs of bonds on the elementary dice plaquette which both connect to the same site , @xmath84 .",
    "one can readily verify that the operators which implement a local gauge transformation , @xmath89 in eqn .",
    "[ gaugeop ] , commute with this dual hamiltonian .",
    "equivalently , since @xmath90 , the dual hamiltonian is invariant under the general @xmath3 gauge transformation , @xmath91 with arbitrary @xmath92 .",
    "remarkably , though , it turns out that this gauge theory actually has an additional set of local @xmath3 symmetries . in particular , it is possible to transform the @xmath93 gauge fields living on the blue ( or red ) links separately , and still leave the hamiltonian invariant .",
    "eqivalently , one can define local red or blue gauge operators which commute with the hamiltonian : @xmath94 with the product over red links which eminate from site @xmath85 , and similarly for the blue links . on the dice lattice , for each 6-fold coordinate site there corresponds both a blue and red local gauge operator , whereas the 3-fold coordinated sites are either red or blue .",
    "the presence of this additional local symmetry can be directly traced to the conservation of the magnetization @xmath31 on each hexagon of the original kagome lattice ring spin - model ( note that this is the conservation of dimer number emerging from each site on the equivalent triangular lattice dimer model ) . indeed , upon using eqn .",

    "the right hand side is simply minus one .",
    "but more generally , this expression indicates that hexagons with a non - zero ( odd integer ) value of the globally conserved spin , @xmath97 , also carry both a red and a blue @xmath3 gauge charge .",
    "this fact allows us to identify both the spinon and vison excitations in the theory .",
    "specifically , consider starting in the  singlet \" sector of the theory with zero magnetization on every hexagon of the kagome lattice , and flipping a single spin .",
    "since each site of the kagome lattice is shared by two hexagons , this creates two hexagons each with @xmath98 . by adding a small near neighbor spin exchange it is possible to hop these two magnetized hexagons , and to spatially",
    "separate them . as we demonstrated above , such magnetized hexagons also carry both a red and a blue @xmath3 charge . provided the dual gauge theory is in it s deconfined phase , these magnetized hexagons can propagate as independent particles .",
    "since two such magnetized hexagons were created when we added spin one to the system ( by flipping the single spin ) , each magnetized hexagon must carry spin @xmath99 , and we can thereby identify these excitations as the deconfined spinons .",
    "a 2d spin liquid with deconfined spinons must necessarily support topological vortex like excitations  the visons@xcite .",
    "the vison acts as a source of @xmath3 `` flux '' for the spinon , whose wave function changes sign as it is transported around a vison . in the @xmath3 gauge theory formulation of 2d fractionalization , the flux of the vison corresponds generally to a plaquette with @xmath100 .",
    "since the spinons which hop on the 6-fold coordinated sites of our dice lattice carry both a red and a blue @xmath3 gauge charge , it is clear that this spin liquid phase will support two flavors of visons - a red ( blue ) vison corresponding to a flux penetrating one red ( blue ) hexagon of the dice lattice .    due to the long - ranged statistical interaction between visons and spinons ,",
    "it is not possible to have both excitations present and freely propagating . in particular ,",
    "if the visons are gapped excitations they will be expelled from the ground state and the spinons will be deconfined . on the other hand , a proliferation and condensation of visons will lead to spinon confinement .",
    "thus , in order to establish 2d fractionalization it is adequate to show an absence of vison condensation .",
    "a useful diagnostic for this is the vison 2-point correlation function : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes a vison creation operator .",

    "the naive extension @xmath141 gives a reasonable extrapolation ( this is used in ref .  ) , but there is no obvious reason to expect it to be exact .",
    "we have demonstrated the equivalence of the generalized kagome antiferromagnet in the easy - axis limit to an xy ring model , and moreover shown that , with the addition of the @xmath142 interaction , this model is in a topologically - ordered phase at the rk point where @xmath69 . at this point ,",
    "the model is a true `` short - range '' spin liquid , insofar as there is evidently no order or broken symmetry , and all excitations are gapped .",
    "but more importantly by computing the vison 2-point function we explicitly demonstrate that this spin - liquid phase is fractionalized , and supports @xmath99 spinon excitations whose gap is @xmath143 . since the visons also are gapped  with a gap of @xmath144 ",
    "this spin liquid state is resilient .",
    "in particular , we may consider a variety of perturbations away from the special soluble model .",
    "following similar arguments to those of moessner and sondhi@xcite , the spin liquid state remains the ground state for @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is some unknown dimensionless number .",
    "if @xmath147 , then the fractionalized phase persists to the pure ring model , but it is possible that an intermediate phase ( or phases ) intervene(s ) such that @xmath148 .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations could be useful in deciding this question .",
    "perhaps more novel perturbations consist in deviations from the condition @xmath149 imposed initially .",
    "again , the presence of a complete gap in the spectrum rules out the destruction of the spin liquid by these perturbations ( provided they are weak ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider the effect of small changes in @xmath6 , in particular @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "viewing these deviations as perturbations , the change in the easy - axis coupling can be rewritten as @xmath152 where the sum in the first line is taken over nearest - neighbor site of the kagome lattice , and is equivalent in the second line to a sum over hexagons that are nearest - neighbors within either the red or blue honeycomb sublattice of the dual dice lattice . remarkably , the latter form , eq .",
    "[ eq : visonke ]  corresponds to a vison hopping or kinetic energy term .",
    "because the visons are already gapped , this clearly will not destabilize the ground state provided the kinetic energy gain remains small relative to the vison gap , i.e. @xmath153 .    the change in the in - plane exchange can be written @xmath154 for any given bond on the kagome lattice , the associated term in eq .",
    "[ eq : spinonke ]  raises @xmath155 of one hexagon by @xmath156 and lowers @xmath155 of another by @xmath157 .",
    "clearly , acting upon the ground state , this takes the system outside the low - energy manifold of @xmath158 .",
    "hence due to the large spin gap , it generates only weak second - order virtual processes that renormalize couplings of the effective ring model . however , its effects are more interesting on some of the excited states . in particular , for a single spinon excitation , one has for @xmath159 a single magnetized hexagon with @xmath160 .",
    "the spinon is completely localized , and there is an associated degeneracy of these excited states reflecting translational invariance due to the arbitrariness of which hexagon is magnetized . for @xmath161 , this degeneracy",
    "is lifted , since eq .",
    "[ eq : spinonke ]  allows the magnetized hexagon to move .",
    "thus eq .  [ eq : spinonke ]  has the effect of giving the spinons some kinetic energy , and the associated states broaden into a band . indeed , it is possible to formally rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : spinonke ]  explicitly as a spinon hopping term . as",
    "above , because of the existing spinon gap , the ground state is expected to be stable to this perturbation for @xmath162 .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of our results to some related discussions in the literature .",
    "an interesting aspect of the spinons in the generalized kagome antiferromagnet we have considered is that they are _",
    "bosonic_. despite the close relation of the topologically ordered state described here to a gutzwiller - projected superfluid , this is in contrast to what is obtained by such projections on su(2)-invariant superconducting states@xcite , as are naturally suggested by work arising from various slave - fermion theories@xcite . as in our work , the large @xmath163 approaches to the spin liquid@xcite also find bosonic spinons .",
    "one of the most intriguing aspects of the numerical results on the spin-@xmath0 nearest - neighbor kagome antiferromagnet@xcite is the proliferation of a large number of very low - energy singlet excitations .",
    "our approach does not shed too much light on this phenomenon , since the spin liquid ground state found here is in fact fully gapped .",
    "it is , however , true that in the easy - axis limit considered above the visons ( which are `` singlets '' under u(1 ) rotations about the @xmath77 axis ) have a much smaller gap ( @xmath164 ) than the spinons .",
    "moreover , it is natural to expect in our effective ring model that as the ratio @xmath165 is decreased , some confinement transition should occur . at such a confinement transition , provided it",
    "is second order , the vison gap must vanish .",
    "should the pure ring model lie near to this critical point , one would indeed expect a large number of low - lying singlet excitations , which on the deconfined side of the critical point are understood as weakly gapped visons .    in light of these results",
    "it should be interesting to look at other bosonic ring models , well away from the integrable rk point .",
    "for instance , the properties of the pure xy ring model , eq .",
    "[ eq : sring ] , defined on four - site plaquettes on diverse lattices ( kagome , square , triangular ... ) are very poorly understood . with the insight that such terms strongly favor vortex pairing , these seem excellent candidate models that might exhibit quantum number fractionalization . a variety of numerical@xcite  and novel analytical techniques@xcite",
    "might profitably be applied to these systems .",
