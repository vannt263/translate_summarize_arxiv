    "the flic fermion action @xcite is a variant of the clover action where the irrelevant operators are constructed using smeared links  @xcite , and mean field improvement  @xcite is performed .",
    "the key point is that short - distance physics is suppressed in the irrelevant operators .",
    "this allows an effective mean - field improved calculation of the clover coefficient , required to match the wilson and clover terms such that @xmath0 errors are eliminated @xcite .",
    "further , the improved chiral properties of flic fermion action allow efficient access to the light quark regime @xcite .",
    "the flic operator is given by @xmath7 where the presence of fat ( or smeared ) links and/or mean field improvement has been indicated by the super- and subscripts .",
    "the mean field improved lattice gauge covariant derivative is defined by @xmath8 and likewise the ( smeared link ) lattice laplacian is such that @xmath9    we choose @xmath10.$ ] for the clover term , one usually selects a standard one - loop @xmath1 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the elementary plaquette in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "however , with the use of fat links , one is also able to choose highly improved definitions of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 correspond to the sum of the four @xmath15 loops at the point @xmath16 in the clover formation , and then define @xmath17 we can construct a 2-loop field strength tensor which is free of @xmath5 errors , @xmath18 or a 3-loop version which is free of @xmath19 errors , @xmath20    the smeared links in the flic action can be equally well constructed from standard ape smeared links , or the more novel stout link method @xcite . as the smeared links only appear in the irrelevant operators , the physics of the action are essentially independent of the choice of smearing method .",
    "the only requirement is that sufficient smearing is done such that the mean field improvement becomes an effective means of estimating the clover coefficient @xmath21 we typically find that four sweeps of ape smearing at @xmath22 or four sweeps of stout smearing at @xmath23 to be sufficient for lattices with a spacing between 0.1 and 0.165 fm .    in this work we use ape",

    "this choice provides the mean link which is closest to unity .",
    "mean field improvement is performed by making the replacements @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mean links for the standard and fattened links .",

    "the different formulations differ at the level of @xmath60 remarkably , the 1-loop action is actually the preferred action .",

    "the effective mass plots are given in figure  [ fig : rhomass ] .",
    "the main effect that we observe is that as the euclidean time index progresses into the latter half of the lattice , the 1-loop flic correlators show reduced fluctuations and reduced error bars when compared with the 2-loop and 3-loop flic results .",
    "the difference is particularly observable on the coarser @xmath63 lattice .",
    "we understand this to be due to the 1-loop action having a more local field strength @xmath64 than the 2- and 3-loop actions making it less susceptible to large fluctuations .",
    "we have examined the role of improvement in the lattice field strength tensor of the flic fermion action , our results demonstrate that the standard 1-loop choice of for the lattice clover term in the flic fermion action provides @xmath5 scaling .    remarkably the 1-loop action provides results that are preferable to those obtained from the 2-loop @xmath51-improved lattice field strength tensor or those obtained from the the 3-loop @xmath65-improved definition .",
    "the 1-loop results provide    1 .   smaller residual @xmath5 errors , 2 .   stable hadron correlators with reduced fluctuations , 3 .   smaller statistical uncertainties , and 4 .   a more efficient action suitable for dynamical fermion simulations",
