    "symplectic integrators are the natural methods for simulating hamiltonian dynamics . to construct a symplectic integrator , we can follow two different procedures : on one side we can use the hamiltonian formalism using generating functions , lie transforms , etc . on the other side",
    "we can take a general method , for instance , runge - kutta formulas , modifying the coefficients to satisfy the symplecticity conditions @xcite .",
    "in general , we obtain implicit methods but when the hamiltonian can be separated into kinetic and potential energies @xmath2 we can construct explicit methods easy to implement .",
    "they are constructed using the diffeomorphisms which left invariant the symplectic form @xmath3 which defines de hamiltonian vector field @xmath4 .",
    "such a diffeomorphisms are called symplectic diffeomorphisms or symplectomorphisms and they form a subgroup denoted by @xmath5 . in particular , the flow of any hamiltonian vector field is a symplectic diffeomorphism and all of them form another subgroup of diffeomorphisms called the hamiltonian diffeomorphisms , denoted by @xmath6 . moreover , using the lie formalism we can consider @xmath7 and @xmath6 as lie groups and the sets of symplectic and hamiltonian vector fields as their lie algebras at the identity element .",
    "then , for every hamiltonian vector field @xmath8 , its flow is given by the exponential @xmath9 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath10 the mapping @xmath11 generated by @xmath12 is a hamiltonian map which defines the symplectic integrator .",
    "in fact , this is a hamiltonian integrator which preserves more structure than the symplectic one .",
    "classically the paralelization of this type of systems is performed by a decomposition of the phase space ( domain decomposition ) or looking for parallelizable tasks into the method or into the equations . however , in the last two decades there were several attempts to develop another type of parallelization for symplectic integrators based on the decomposition of the time variable .",
    "the first attempt of some parallel - in - time algorithm for a scalar differential equation was published by nievergelt in 1964 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to decompose the total time in several subintervals which can be computed in parallel .",
    "each interval , called a `` branch '' , must be modified propagating the corrected local initial condition to each subinterval ; this technique has derived in the _ multishooting _ methods . although the nievergelt s algorithm is not iterative , almost all other algorithms use an iterative process to approximate the sequential numerical solution .",
    "those iterative algorithms consist in two steps : one _ predictor _ which estimates in parallel the value of several branches and one _ _ corrector _ _ which approaches the final solution propagating the predictions between different branches .",
    "we call them the _ time - parallel _ algorithms and all of them differ in the corrector step which uses different iterative process to convergence",
    ". of course , there are others differences but in this paper we are interested in the corrector step .    as noted by saha , stadel and tremaine @xcite one way to time - parallelize an almost integrable hamiltonian system",
    "is to compute in parallel several branches saving the perturbing contributions and to propagate them computing in sequence the integrable hamiltonian part .",
    "this technique is reproduced in @xcite for high - order symplectic integrators however , it works fine if the ratio of the computing time of the integrable over the perturbing part is very small .",
    "this approach is very accurate but expensive . on the other extreme",
    ", there is the _ parareal _ method introduced by lions , maday and turinici in @xcite and refined in @xcite . in this method",
    "the propagation of the predictions is made by a simple increment of the corrector at every iteration . as a result",
    ", it is a very fast algorithm , however , for hamiltonian systems there are several inconvenients associated to the non preservation of the geometric structure of the underlying integrators .    in order to deal with this type of problems ,",
    "bal and wu @xcite have done the first step considering a new way to spread the information between branches in the sequential step and practically destroying the `` pure '' parareal scheme . also , dai _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have introduced another variation of the parareal step , using symmetries and projections into the energy manifold to preserve the geometric properties of the underlying integrators .",
    "recently , the author has proposed a geometric corrector step using lie s algebras @xcite which is equivalent to that from dai _ et .",
    "al._. in this paper we translate that approach to the hofer s geometry in order to search not only for hamiltonian maps but for optimizing the energy ( which we relate with the number of iterations ) to go from the first guess solution to the final solution .",
