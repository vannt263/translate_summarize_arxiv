    "the parent of the copper - oxide superconductors is a single - orbital mott insulator in which one unpaired d - electron is responsible for the essential physics . by contrast , the iron pnictides are multi - orbital bad metallic systems in which several d - electrons play an active role . given that both systems superconduct , it is highly suggestive that combining the key ingredients of the two might result in a higher @xmath4 material .",
    "one of the ubiquitous features of the cuprates is dynamical spectral weight transfer@xcite arising fundamentally from the lack of rigidity of the hubbard bands in a mott system .",
    "such spectral weight rearrangments are well documented in optical conductivity measurements@xcite and oxygen k - edge x - ray absorption@xcite .",
    "spectral weight rearangements in the cuprates are well described@xcite by the single - band hubbard model .",
    "classic mott systems such as vo@xmath5 and nio contain several d - orbitals that are singly occupied . at present , although there are some studies on mott transitions in multiorbital systems using dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , there is no formalism that describes the spectral weight rearrangements in such systems under doping nor any experiments that observe this effect . in particular , since dmft neglects the momentum - dependence in the single particle self - energy , the essential physics of hopping - induced spectral weight transfer under the introduction of dopings can not be captured correctly .",
    "such momentum dependence is particularly important in the treament@xcite of mixed - valent systems in which inter - site coherences dominate the physics .",
    "it is precisely the theoretical description of spectral weight rearrangement in multi - orbital mott systems that we tackle here .",
    "we develop the strong coupling perturbative analysis for multi - orbital systems and derive expressions for the spectral weight shifts in the lower band as a function of doping .",
    "the hund s couling , a new energy scale absent in the single band hubbard model , is included explicitly in this study .",
    "it has been pointed out that hund s coupling play a crucial role in determining the correlation effects@xcite . as a result , it is also important to undersatnd how hund s coupling affects the spectral properties which is also investigated in this paper .",
    "the key result we obtain is that multi - orbital physics enhances the total spectral weight transferred across the mott gap .",
    "it is our hope that this study will motivate experiments on doping multi - orbital mott insulators .",
    "indeed , the low energy physics of strongly correlated systems remains one of the most challenging problems .",
    "the difficulty in strong coupling is uncloaking a set of excitations which get rid of the interactions .",
    "the presence of spectral weight transfer demonstrates that such entities , should they exist , are not straightforwardly related to those in the uv - complete theory .",
    "for example , it has been known since 1967@xcite in the context of the 1-band hubbard model that the total spectral intensity of the lower band exceeds the total number of electron states in the band .",
    "hence , the additional degree of freedom in the lower band must be orthogonal to an electron .",
    "the culprit that accounts for the excess spectral weight in the lower band is dynamical spectral weight transfer ( dswt)@xcite .",
    "dswt emerges from mixing between doubly occupied sites in the upper band with singly occupied ones in the lower band .",
    "the fact that this effect can account for the orthogonality for electron addition at low energies implies that it provides a natural mechanism to explain the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight , @xmath6 , seen in angle - resolved photoemission@xcite ( arpes ) in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "consequently , it is important to catalogue precisely how this effect is manifest in multi - orbital mott systems .",
    "we demonstrate here that this effect is even more pronounced because the multi - orbitals enhace the phase space for dynamical mixing between the electronic states below and above the mott gap .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider a general multi - orbital hubbard model in the presence of hund s coupling and analyze the spectral weight transfer for various electron fillings in the atomic limit . due to the existence of hund s coupling and the paired hopping with",
    "the energy scales @xmath7 , we show that the distribution of the spectral weights is enriched . moreover , the non - zero @xmath7 also complicates the calculation of dswt when the hoppings are introduced .",
    "this is analyzed in section iii .",
    "the full details of the derivations are placed in the appendix .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a multi - orbital mott system consists of two parts , h = h_k + h_i , [ hamfull ] with @xmath8 the non - interacting tight - binding hamiltonian h_k = - _ ija b t_abc^_i ac_j b , [ hamk ] and @xmath9 creates an electron with spin @xmath10 in the orbtial @xmath11 on site @xmath12 . due to the existence of the multi - orbital structure , electrons on the same site experience different types of interactions , including the intra- and inter - orbital coulomb repulsive interactions , hund s coupling , and the paired hopping between different orbitals .",
    "the resulting on - site interaction for the multi - orbital system reads h_i & = & _ ia u n_ian_ia + _ i , b > a(u- ) n_ia n_ib + & & - _ i , b > a2j_ia_ib + j(p_iap_ib^+ h.c . ) , [ hami ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . it should be noted that @xmath17 holds for systems with both orbital degeneracy and cubic symmetry .",
    "this relation will be used in this paper unless stated otherwise .      before we present the result for the 2-orbital system ,",
    "let us recount the atomic - limit result for the single - orbital mott insulator . in this limit ,",
    "the exact single - particle retarded green function is [ specweight ] g_i^r()=+ , the two poles , split by @xmath18 , carry spectral weight of @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "each hole subtracts a single state from the high energy sector , thereby leading to the @xmath20 residue .",
    "the empty state reappears at low energies as part of the addition spectrum at low energies .",
    "the fact that the empty part of the spectrum grows as @xmath21 as opposed to @xmath22 in a band insulator reflects this static transfer of spectral weight .",
    "to begin our study of a multi - orbital system , we start with the two - orbital case since a variety of transition metal oxides with orthorhombic crystal structure have degenerate quasi-1d @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands which dominate in the low energy physics . in this case , the mott physics will be prominent near integer fillings of @xmath25 .",
    "one interesting question is how is the spectral weight redistributed when such systems are doped with holes or electrons near these integer fillings . in the atomic limit",
    ", the spectral weights can be obtained exactly by evaluating a^_i ( ) = _ a i m g^_ia ( ) , [ aw ] where g^_ia ( ) = _ m is the electron removal ( addition ) green function on site @xmath12 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the eigenenergies and eigenvectors of @xmath28 with two orbitals listed in table [ table : one ] . because a non - zero @xmath7 lifts the degeneracy of two - electron states on a single site , the spectral weight also splits into several parts separated by the energy scales of @xmath7 whenever two - electron states are involved .",
    "for example , if @xmath29 and @xmath30 the spectral intensity should be 3 for the upper hubbard bands and 1 for the lower hubbard band with a gap of @xmath18 between them . as @xmath7 is turned on , using eq .",
    "[ aw ] and table [ table : one ] , we have that a^+_i ( ) & = & ( --u+j ) + ( --u-j ) + & + & ( --u+j ) + ( --u - j ) , + a^-_i ( ) & = & ( - ) . [ apm-1e ] it can be seen that the upper hubbard bands split into three parts with energies of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( @xmath17 is used ) with different spectral intensities as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one](a ) .",
    "as the system is doped with either holes or electrons , the redistribution of the spectral weights occurs at all energy scales in a manner similar to that in single - band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "moreover , the amount of spectral weight transferred from the high energy down to low energy is even larger in multi - orbital mott systems .",
    "the reason is that the multi - orbital structure provides more ways to add or remove electrons . in the following",
    ", we will analyze case - by - case the spectral weight distributions near different interger fillings .",

    "one can realize eq .",
    "[ mlhb-1-x ] by counting the total number of ways to remove and add electrons to the system without resulting in an energy change .",
    "while there is one way to remove an electron from an occupied site contributing @xmath20 to @xmath40 , there are four ways to add an electron to an empty site in a two - orbital system with spin @xmath41 leading to the remaining contribution of @xmath42 .",

    "( [ specweight ] ) ) that the total weight of the lower band is @xmath43@xcite , where @xmath22 is the number of holes . in fact , for @xmath34 , the spectral weight can be obtained straightforwardly based on the same argument for @xmath2-orbital systems with spin @xmath41 in the atomic limit , m^h(1-x ) = 1-x + 2n_ox = 1+(2n_o-1)x .",

    ", the explanation for a vanishing of s at optimal doping requires the incorporation of strong correlation effects .",
    "one of us@xcite has addresed this issue by considering the spectral weight transfer in the single - band hubbard model in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the particle - hole symmetric condition can be defined where the number of states below and above the chemical potential becomes equal . in the atomic limit",
    ", this condition yields 1-x_c=2 x_c , which predicts the vanishing of @xmath78 at @xmath120 .",
    "away from the atomic limit , dswt renders @xmath121 to a lower value around @xmath122 as observed in the experiments .",
    "that particle - hole symmetry is dynamically generated near optimal in strong coupling models of the cuprates has also been confirmed by vidhyadhiraja and co - workers@xcite .",
    "this senario can be generalized to the current @xmath2-orbital mott system , allowing us to make the following predictions .",
    "we present the particle - hole symmetric condition in the atomic limit to show how the critical doping with vanishing @xmath78 depends on the multi - orbital structure , and it is expected that in the real materials this critical doping should be reduced to lower values due to dswt .    in the case of @xmath34 , the particle - hole symmetric condition is unambiguously given by [ holds ] 1-x_c = 2n_ox_c x_c = in the atomic limit which is strictly less than @xmath123 as would be the critical doping in the 2-orbital case .",
    "interestingly , mukerjee@xcite has analyzed the thermopower in the atomic limit of the 3-orbital hubbard model and found it to vanish at the doping level predicted by eq .",
    "( [ holds ] ) .",
    "this agreement further corroborates our treatment here that the particle - hole symmetric condition in the lower band shifts to lower values of doping as multi - orbital contributions are included . for @xmath48 ,",
    "again the situation is complicaed by hund s coupling and the paired hopping , and the particle - hole symmetric condition depends crucially on the magnitude of @xmath7 . if @xmath7 is large enough to produce new gaps in addition to those created by @xmath18 , the particle - hole symmetric condition should be determined only by the bands in the vicinity of the chemical potential . for example , for the case of @xmath44 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one](c ) , the particle - hole symmetric condition should be 2x_c=1.5(1-x_c)x_c= if @xmath7 is large enough",
    ". if @xmath7 is not large enough to generate new gaps , all the states within @xmath124 and @xmath125 defined in eqs .",
    "[ mlhb - h ] and [ mlhb - e ] should contribute to the thermopower .",
    "consequently , in the latter case the particle - hole symmetric conditions can be written in general form n_i(1-x)= ( 2n_o - n_i+1)x x_c^h(n_i ) = [ xch ] for @xmath126 , and ( n_i+1)x = ( 2n_o - n_i)(1-x ) x_c^e(n_i ) = [ xce ] for @xmath127 .",
    "these relationships have interesting consequences for superconductivity .",
    "since the paricle - hole symmetric critical doping is intimately related to the optimal doping of superconductivity@xcite , we can draw the following conclusion . optimal doping for superconductivity in multi - orbital mott systems",
    "should be reduced relative to their single - orbital ( that is , one unpaired d electron ) counterparts because the particle - hole symmetric conditions derived above are all bounded from above by the single - orbital value of @xmath0 . according to eqs .",
    "[ xch ] and [ xce ] , either a hole - doped multi - orbital mott material with smaller integer fillings , or an electron - doped mott multi - orbital material with larger integer fillings could serve as a good parent compound for new high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "in this paper , spectral properties and related predictions have been studied in multi - orbital mott systems for the first time .",
    "taking a two - orbital system with full on - site interaction as a starting point , we have analyzed exact spectral functions in the atomic limit near integer fillings of @xmath128 and generalized the results to @xmath2 orbitals at arbitrary filling .",
    "most striking is the result that for @xmath34 , the static part of the spectral weight of the unnoccupied part of the lower band grows as @xmath42 as opposed to @xmath21 in the single - orbital case .",
    "this result can be easily be confirmed by doping a multi - orbital mott system such as nio and measuring the oxygen k - edge x - ray intensity as has been done previously for the cuprates@xcite . as the hopping terms are turned on",
    ", the redistribution of the spectral weight , namely dynamical spectral weight transfer ( dswt ) , occurs at all the energy scales in a manner similar to that in the single - band hubbard model .",
    "we have developed a general formalism to perform the perturbation theory in the strong coupling limit and applied this method to the two - orbital system .",
    "the intensity of the lower energy bands has been explicitly calculated for filling @xmath34 , and we have found that the leading - order correction due to dswt is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the empty sites .",
    "relative to the single - band hubbard model , we have shown that both static and dynamical spectral weight transfers are greatly enhanced as a consequence of multi - orbital structure .",
    "the corresponding low energy effective hamiltonian for @xmath34 in the two - orbital mott system has been derived .",
    "moreover , we have shown that a critical doping , defined as the doping level exhibiting zero thermopower , is reduced to a smaller value as the number of orbitals increases .",
    "motivated by the lesson from the cuprates that this critical doping is intimately related to the optimal doping of superconductivity , we have proposed that either a hole - doped multi - orbital mott material with smaller integer fillings , or an electron - doped mott multi - orbital material with larger integer fillings could serve as a good parent compound for new high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
