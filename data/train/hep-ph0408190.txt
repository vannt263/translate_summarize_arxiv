    "quarkonia , bound states of a quark @xmath4 and its anti - quark @xmath5 , are the qcd equivalents of positronium ( bound @xmath6 ) in qed . just as we have learned much about qed from the spectra of positronium , so too we probe the strong force with @xmath7 bound states .",
    "quarkonia form the simplest , most symmetric strongly interacting system with only two constituents ( unlike baryons ) and those being identical ( unlike mesons with `` open '' flavor ) .",
    "the qcd potential is much richer than that of qed . in the simplest formulation , the so - called `` cornell '' potential",
    ", we have : @xmath8 the first term mimics the single - photon exchange term in qed and corresponds to one - gluon exchange in qcd , dominating at short distances ( @xmath9fm ) with large momentum transfers .",
    "this is the asymptotically `` free '' regime which has @xmath10 small , making calculations perturbative ( pqcd ) .",
    "the second term , important at larger distance scales ( @xmath11 fm ) , leads to `` confinement '' and is in a regime where @xmath10 is large , making calculations non - perturbative .    in this presentation",
    "i will discuss only _ heavy _",
    "quarkonia , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ( charmonium ) or @xmath14 ( bottomonium ) .",
    "the top quark is not sufficiently stable to form hadrons before decaying . ]",
    "a big advantage of such @xmath12 systems is that they are not very relativistic : @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ". therefore non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) can be used to good approximation , greatly simplifying calculations .",
    "of particular note is the fact that lattice qcd ( lqcd ) is making important advances in predictive power for these systems .",
    "further , the physical sizes of @xmath12 states span the range of `` free '' and `` confined '' , allowing both aspects of qcd to be studied .    while this presentation concentrates on spectra and decays",
    ", one can not ignore the importance of production in that much is to be learned from the formation of such @xmath12 systems from ( virtual ) photons and gluons .",
    "the spectra for charmonia and bottomonia are shown in figure  [ fig : charmbottom ] , with some typical transitions indicated .",
    "note that the qcd wells for such states are much deeper than the corresponding case for positronium , leading to a much richer spectrum , involving many _",
    "hadronic _ transitions in addition to those associated with photon emission .",
    "in particular , the @xmath17 spectrum has three radial excitations below open bottom threshold and enough energy splitting to allow multi - pion or @xmath18 emission in transitions among states .",
    "this document is a faithful replication of the pic04 presentation being a non - exhaustive _ selection _ of topics .",
    "discoveries or updates made after pic04 will not be included ; this is therefore a snapshot of the field on 27 june 2004 .",
    "one exception is that in the references i give the _ current _ status of the work .",
    "of course this review builds on previous efforts , of which two good examples are the pic03 contribution of mahlke - krger @xcite and that from the 2003 lepton - photon conference by skwarnicki@xcite .",
    "there is also a comprehensive review of quarkonia underway by the quarkonium working group@xcite ; this cern yellow report is to be completed by september 2004 .",
    "these states have the spins of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in an anti - symmetric state , so that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the states with @xmath23 ( pseudoscalars ) are called `` @xmath24 '' and those with @xmath25 are called `` @xmath26 '' .    for @xmath17 there is no news on these singlets ; the cleo limits@xcite from 2003 have been slightly updated@xcite but none of the five have been observed as yet . in the @xmath27 sector",
    "these have been some new measurements of the mass , width and decays of the ground state of charmonium , the @xmath28 , but no startling developments .",
    "the lone singlet @xmath29 state of charmonium , the @xmath30 , remains elusive , with active programs in @xmath31 production , @xmath1 decay and @xmath32 ( and maybe others ! ) all in the hunt .",
    "the biggest news from the spin singlets is the ( re)discovery of the @xmath0 .",
    "this had been previously reported by the crystal ball experiment @xcite in the m1 radiative transition @xmath33 .",
    "but cleo , with similar sensitivity to the crystal ball , at @xmath34 significance . ]",
    "does not confirm that observation.@xcite    but four _ new _ observations of this radially excited singlet have now been _",
    "published_. first , belle presented a very clean signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : etacpr ] ) in @xmath35 decays @xcite ; they also observed the state in continuum production of double charmonium , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this was followed by both cleo@xcite and babar@xcite publishing their measurements of the @xmath0 in two - photon fusion .",
    "the four new measurements of the mass of the @xmath0 are shown in the right portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : etacpr ] , presented@xcite as the hyperfine mass splitting between it and the spin - triplet @xmath1 .",
    "the weighted average for this splitting is @xmath37 which is roughly _ half _ the magnitude for this splitting based on the older crystal ball measurement of @xmath38 , and which is to be compared with @xmath39 mev .",
    "mev for this hyperfine splitting . ]",
    "the splittings @xmath40 and @xmath41 are of some interest because , while the @xmath28 and @xmath42 have small radius and are rather deep in the coulomb - like qcd well , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 start to sample the confinement region of the qcd potential .",
    "most theoretical estimates of @xmath41 are higher than the new measurements@xcite , perhaps because they tend to assume a scalar qcd potential in the confinement region .",
    "a recent lattice result@xcite , which is quenched and thus ignores dynamical light quarks , gives a span of values of @xmath43 mev , depending on input parameters .",
    "this situation warrants a new look at models and an unquenched lattice calculation .",
    "the vector @xmath3 and @xmath44 resonances are directly produced by @xmath6 colliders via annihilation to a virtual photon . with large data sets recently obtained by cleo at cesr and bes at bepc ,",
    "it is not surprising that these two experiments dominate this portion of the onia news .",
    "good measurements of @xmath46(ns ) are particularly important .",
    "they play a crucial role in determining the resonance widths , in that these states are significantly more narrow than the collider beam energy spread .",
    "cleo plans to measure @xmath47 to within a few percent from its careful scans of the resonant line shapes .",
    "learning @xmath48 to @xmath49 thus means measuring @xmath45 to similar precision .",
    "also , @xmath45 is needed to evaluate many other important branching fractions , in that often what is really measured is the product @xmath50(ns)@xmath51(ns)@xmath52 .",
    "cleo has both the statistical power ( over 5 million of each of the three bound - state @xmath44 resonances ) and the control of systematics to make such precise measurements of @xmath45 .",
    "their preliminary results@xcite are @xmath45(ns ) = @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for n = 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively . for the @xmath44(1s )",
    "this agrees with the current pdg average@xcite , but the results for the two radial excitations are significantly higher than in the pdg .",
    "these results are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmumu ] .",
    "the _ color octet _ model was developed to help explain large charmonium production rates at hadron colliders by having @xmath27 produced from a single gluon ( hence , as a color _ octet _ state ) and then perturbatively shedding a soft gluon before emerging from the interaction .",
    "models having two gluons form the @xmath27 meson as a final state particle are called _ color singlet _ models .",
    "a good place to test such octet@xcite and singlet@xcite models is the glue - rich environment of @xmath44 decay .",
    "while both predict roughly equal rates for @xmath57 , the singlet momentum spectrum is much softer in that a second @xmath58 and @xmath59 must hadronize as charmed mesons .",
    "cleo@xcite has measured @xmath60 which includes feed - down from other charmonia ( @xmath1 , ... ) ; this is consistent with the predictions of the models .",
    "however the measured @xmath42 momentum spectrum is much too soft to support the color octet model .",
    "further the observation of @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , and the decay rates of @xmath44 to @xmath63 and @xmath64 are above the octet model predictions .      major progress has been made on a long standing puzzle in vector charmonium .",
    "because three - gluon decay to hadrons of @xmath27 and electro - magnetic production / decay of such states via a virtual photon both depend on the wave - function overlap ( @xmath66 ) one naively expects :    @xmath67    there are many complications , caveats and considerations , form factor dependences on @xmath68 , helicity conservation issues , non - relativistic effects , interference with continuum , ... ] to this `` equality '' , so one should not be too surprised at small deviations . however , two particular hadronic modes , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , both vector - pseudoscalar ( v - p ) , are blatant violators of eqn .  [",
    "eqn : rhopi ] , with limits@xcite of @xmath71 .    big new data sets at bes / bepc ( 14 million @xmath1 decays and 6.4 pb@xmath72 of continuum ) and cleo - c / cesr - c ( @xmath73 million @xmath1 decays from 5.5 pb@xmath72 of luminosity and @xmath74 20 pb@xmath72 of continuum ) have come to rescue .",
    "bes has presented evidence@xcite for the modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the final state @xmath77 , as depicted in their dalitz plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : bescleopv ] .",
    "there is a large signal in the neutral mode , giving @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( slight suppression relative to @xmath42 ) .",
    "the charged mode has a significant signal as well ( @xmath80 ) and gives @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( heavily suppressed relative to @xmath42 @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , there is a large difference in these isospin - related final states .",
    "the small continuum sample of bes does not allow for a subtraction of this possible background source .",
    "cleo has presented@xcite results for @xmath84 for a large number of modes , including , for the first time , @xmath69 in the @xmath85 final state .",
    "they have made a continuum _ subtraction _ , but assume no interference contribution .",
    "after projecting the dalitz plot to obtain samples of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , they extract the yield by demanding no missing energy , as shown to the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : bescleopv ] .",
    "their results in the @xmath85 final state are @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the status of this `` puzzle '' is represented pictorially in fig .  [",
    "fig : puzzle ] . some of the important features : _ ( i ) _ the @xmath69 and @xmath90 modes have now been _ measured _ ; _ ( ii ) _ the isospin violating ( and hence , electro - magnetic ) modes seem to support the `` 12% rule '' ; _ ( iii ) _ the isospin - related modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 seem quite different in their behavior ; _ ( iv ) _ the a - p states do not seem suppressed , while v - t states are suppressed by about a factor of @xmath91 ... not nearly as much as the v - p states @xmath69 and @xmath76 .",
    "an open question is whether the suppression is due to @xmath68-@xmath92 mixing , meaning a possible enhancement in v - p decays of the @xmath3(3770 ) , by virtue of common virtual @xmath93 loops .",
    "another interesting comparison of the @xmath42 and @xmath1 wave - functions is the relative phase for each of these to decay strongly via @xmath27 annihilation to three gluons ( `` s '' ) as opposed to electro - magnetically via a single virtual photon ( `` em '' ) .",
    "the decay @xmath94 can proceed by either of these two routes , but @xmath95 is purely a strong decay ( su(3 ) symmetry ) and @xmath96 is purely electro - magnetic ( g - parity ) .",
    "hence @xmath97    previously bes@xcite has measured @xmath98 . with @xmath99",
    "@xmath1 events they have observed a large sample of mono - chromatic @xmath100 candidates from which they obtain@xcite @xmath101 = @xmath102 . combining this with various prior results on the @xmath103 and @xmath104 channels gives @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are consistent .",
    "bes also re - measured@xcite @xmath109 from their 55 million @xmath42 sample as @xmath110 , meaning @xmath101/ @xmath109 = @xmath111 , somewhat large for the `` 12% rule '' represented by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rhopi ] .",
    "bottomonium ( see fig .  [ fig : charmbottom ] ) is the only qcd system with a stable member that has two units of orbital angular momentum .",
    "this makes these `` d '' states important to test spin - orbit and high - l effects in both models and lqcd . the cleo analysis of the four photon cascade @xmath44(3s)@xmath112 `` d '' @xmath113 is now final@xcite .",
    "a single state is observed at @xmath114 mev at @xmath115 significance .",
    "the decay rate and intermediate @xmath116 and @xmath117 assignments are consistent with this being the @xmath118 state .",
    "the impact of this result on lqcd@xcite is shown in the left portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : lqcd ] . plotted first results for nine `` golden '' quantities from analyses that were `` quenched '' , thus not incorporating the effects of dynamical light quarks .",
    "next to this are recent _ un_quenched results with @xmath119 quarks included .",
    "none of the nine quantities are used as `` input '' .",
    "these show lqcd being able to attain better than 5% accuracy in these quantities , one of which is the d - s splitting in bottomonium .    turning to charmonium",
    ", there is the continuing puzzle of the nature of the @xmath3(3770 ) , which one can characterize as being @xmath120 .",
    "clearly @xmath121 in that the @xmath3(3770 ) _ is _ directly produced in @xmath6 annihilation .",
    "belle@xcite has recently observed a solid @xmath3(3770 ) signal in @xmath122 , from which they extract @xmath123 .",
    "this comparison would imply that there is large s - d mixing , although color - octet models might be able to accommodate this rate for a pure `` d '' state ( @xmath124 ) .    an important mode to investigate would seem to be @xmath3(3770)@xmath125 . a compilation of markii and bes results@xcite gives @xmath126 kev , which is near the _ upper bound _ for this rate as analyzed by cleo@xcite .",
    "the kuang - yan prediction@xcite for this rate is 20 - 107 kev , depending on the level of s - d mixing ; however , the cleo limit@xcite , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqcd ] , for @xmath44(1d)@xmath125 , is some seven times below@xcite that predicted for a such a d state in the kuang - yan model , casting doubt on whether the @xmath127 measured for the @xmath3(3770 ) is _ really _ consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "once the decay to @xmath128 is solidly observed , the angular distributions of the decay products should help sort out@xcite @xmath129 .",
