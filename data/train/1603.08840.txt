    "star clusters ( scs ) are groups of coeval stars that formed from the same molecular cloud so they can be considered as building blocks of galaxies .",
    "this is the reason why the study of rich extragalactic scs provides valuable information about the star formation and chemical histories of the host galaxies .",
    "however , the current knowledge of both the stellar formation processes and the chemical evolution of distant galaxies is still far from being complete . even for the galaxies in the local group",
    ", there is a very limited understanding of these processes . in this context",
    ", the scs of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , on account on their proximity , richness and variety can facilitate our comprehension of the chemical enrichment and star formation history of this galaxy as a whole @xcite .",
    "in fact , lmc scs can be resolved in their individual members and can therefore be studied from their color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "although the lmc scs recently estimated number is approximately 3100 @xcite , this number may be significantly larger if emission - free associations and objects related to emission nebulae are included @xcite .",
    "+ integrated spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study scs in galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , template spectra are very useful in deriving individual clusters parameters not only in our galaxy ( e.g. , ahumada et al . 2007 ) but also in the large and small magellanic clouds ( e.g. , santos et al . 2006 ; piatti et al . 2005 ; dias et al . 2010 ) and even in distant galaxies ( e.g. , jablonka et al .",

    "note that whereas some amount of field star contamination is expected to be found in the observed spectra , only bright field stars could significantly affect them .",
    "no bright stars seem to be present in the fields of the observed clusters .",
    "we obtained ages and reddening values for the cluster sample using two different methods . on the one hand , applying the template match procedure that consists of comparing the line strengths and continuum distribution of the observed cluster spectra with those of template spectra with known properties . on the other hand , comparing the observed integrated spectra with two sets of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "these two methods are briefly described below .",
    "to derive reddening and age values , we followed the steps described in santos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and @xcite . in brief",
    ", we first used the equivalent width ( ew ) method which allowed us to estimate a preliminary age range value .",
    "this method implies using ews of selected spectral features and their sums , along with their calibrations with age from the works of bica & alloin ( 1986 ) and santos & piatti ( 2004 , hereafter sp04 ) .",
    "taking into account the first preliminary age range value estimated , we then applied the template matching method which consists in comparing the observed spectra to template spectra with well - determined ages ( e.g. , ahumada et al .",
    "2002 , minniti et al .",
    "foreground @xmath0 reddening values were also determined through the template matching method . only for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have also determined @xmath0 color excesses by interpolation between the extinction maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 , hereafter bh82 ) .",
    "we preferred not to take into account the interstellar extinction maps of @xcite because they appear to be basically saturated towards the lmc disk .",
    "the ews , in angstrom units (  ) , measured for the first four h balmer lines , hcaii and kcaii , gband ( ch ) and mgi ( 5167 + 5173 + 5184  ) are shown in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we also included in this table the sum of the ews of the three balmer lines h@xmath7 , h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 ( s@xmath10 ) , as well as the sum of the ews of the metallic lines kcaii , gband ( ch ) and mgi ( s@xmath11 ) .",
    "typical errors of approximately 10% on individual ew measurements were the result of tracing slightly different continua . based on sp04 s study ,",
    "@xcite obtained two equations to estimate cluster ages from the sum of the ews .",
    "we used their equation ( 1 ) , based on s@xmath11 , to get a first age estimate , and then we used their equation ( 2 ) , based on s@xmath10 , for a second age estimate .",
    "we also employed sp04 s diagnostic diagrams ( dds ) involving s@xmath10 and s@xmath11 , which are useful for the discrimination of old , intermediate - age and young clusters .",
    "the resulting ages are listed in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "note that , in general terms , the age ranges derived using s@xmath11 and s@xmath10 are fairly consistent .",
    "balmer indices of some very young clusters that show spectral features in emission can not be used to estimate cluster ages .",
    "based on the first age estimates , we selected among the available templates those to be compared with the observed spectrum .",
    "we decided to use santos et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter s95 ) template spectral library because it represents the blue - violet integrated spectral evolution of the young magellanic cloud star clusters .",
    "this library , however , includes some templates covering a limited spectral range between 3500 and 4700  and is valid only for clusters younger than approximately 170 myr .",
    "we should to make it clear that these templates were corrected for foreground reddening using @xmath0 = 0.06 ( s95 ) .",
    "the final age determination was reached by varying reddening and templates until the best match was obtained between the chosen template and the observed spectrum . to perform reddening corrections",
    "when applying the template matching method , we used the normal reddening law @xmath12 @xcite , the relation a@xmath13 = 3.0@xmath0 , and the fast integrated spectra analyzer ( fisa , bentez - llambay et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter bcp12 ) algorithm .",
    "this software permits a fast and reasonably accurate determination of a cluster age and reddening using its integrated spectrum .",
    "as explained by bcp12 , the determination of the most adequate template spectrum - reddening combination is performed by minimizing the @xmath14 function , i.e. , bcp12 s equation ( 16 ) .",
    "the results obtained after applying the template matching method are presented in table  [ tbl-5 ] , wherein columns ( 3)-(4 ) provide the corresponding age and @xmath0 color excesses . only for comparison purposes",
    ", we list in column ( 2 ) cluster @xmath0 reddening values estimated by interpolation using the extinction maps of bh82 .",
    "these values should probably be considered as the lower limit for cluster reddening .",
    "the best fits of the reddening - corrected spectra with templates from s95 are presented in figs .",
    "residual fluxes computed as ( f@xmath15 - f@xmath16)/f@xmath15 are shown in these figures .",
    "we also indicate in figs . 3 - 4 the name and age range of the selected template for each cluster .      we have also fitted our observed spectra through the spectral synthesis technique .",
    "this method has proven to be a powerful tool for fitting a given observed spectrum ( @xmath17 ) with a model ( @xmath18 ) that best matches the observed one . as evolutionary synthetic spectra of ssps",
    "are recently available , some fundamental parameters of stellar clusters , such as reddening , age , and metallicity can be directly obtained by means of the above mentioned technique . to achieve this goal",
    ", we chose to use the starlight code @xcite , which incorporates a set of ssp models of different ages and metallicities ( a `` base '' ) .",
    "the base spectra are linearly combined in different proportions to obtain the resulting spectrum @xmath18 which best fits @xmath17 .",
    "since the fits are performed by minimizing @xmath19 ^ 2 \\times \\omega_\\lambda^2 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the weight given to the fits , the spectral regions that are not wanted to be modeled ( e.g. emission lines or cosmic rays ) are masked out by chosing @xmath20 = 0 .",
    "this minimization yields the best population mixture in the parameter space .    for our purposes , we selected two bases of ssps : the first one consisting of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) ssps with 15 different ages ranging between 1 and 500 myr and with the same metallicity level as the lmc ( @xmath21 = 0.4 )",
    "this base , hereafter `` base a '' , was drawn from a more general set of 150 ssps with 25 ages and 6 metallicities .",
    "we opted to constrain the metallicity to that of the lmc and not to consider ages older than 1 gyr , since it is not relevant from the astrophysical point of view when we deal with lmc cluster spectra .",
    "the second base of synthetic spectra taken from basti database @xcite , hereafter `` base b '' , includes 15 spectra with @xmath21 = 0.4 , with ages ranging from 40 to 500 myr .",
    "it should be mentioned that although basti includes both high and low resolution spectra with 11 different metallicities and ages up to 15 gyr , we decided to use high resolution spectra .",
    "@xcite derived a mean present - day metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -0.34 for the lmc , in good agreement with previous metallicity determinations of the young lmc population .",
    "this metallicity matches better the models for z = 0.008 ( or @xmath21 = 0.4 ) , which were now used for the age and reddening determination .",
    "the corresponding fits are shown in figs . 5 - 8 , along with the most probable combination of ssps ( right panels ) , i.e. , the `` population vector '' formed by non - zero contributions .",
    "in general , a stellar cluster is represented by only one component which gives 100% of the flux . in some cases",
    ", however , a multicomponent fit is needed due to the coarseness of the parameters in the base , possible contamination of foreground and background stars and the low s / n ratio , as was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "there is still another source of uncertainty in the determination of the parameters of a cluster : the lack of some ssps in the base , known as `` template mismatch '' .",
    "the right panels in figs . 5 - 8 show that for most cases just one ssp is needed , while in others the population vector consists of more components .",
    "mean ages calculated over the population vector of each fit are shown beside each vertical line .",
    "the starlight code also computes the internal reddening of each cluster .",
    "since the flux - calibrated spectra were also corrected for a galactic mean extinction of @xmath22 = 0.15 , any `` @xmath0 '' value yielded by the code will reflect an `` extra '' interstellar extinction .",
    "while in some cases this `` extra '' reddening could be due to the fact that we are using a mean galactic reddening value to correct our spectra , in some fits the values of `` @xmath0 '' shown here could denote possible internal reddening of the cluster inside the lmc . in table",
    "[ tbl-5 ] , we list the resulting ages and @xmath0 values .",
    "starlight does not provide any kind of errors in the parameters of the models .",
    "for this reason , @xcite analyzed the errors involved after performing simulations on the fits of star cluster spectra and derived an uncertainty of @xmath23 0.03 for @xmath0 ( @xmath23 0.1 for @xmath24 ) and @xmath23 0.1 dex for log age .",
    "taking into account their results and the fact that our observed spectra are of comparatively high s / n ratio ( @xmath25 28 ) which imply more reliable determinations of the parameters , we conservatively adopted an error of 0.1 dex in the log age determinations for both simple and multiple population fits .",
    "figs . 5 - 8",
    "show that our fits are of good quality since the residual fluxes are small in all the fittings . for sl106 , sl428 , sl498 and sl516 , however ,",
    "no reliable fits were obtained using base b , probably because these are very young clusters and , as mentioned before , basti does not present ssps for age values lower than 40 myr .",
    "some of the spectra belong to young stellar clusters .",
    "as these clusters are probably associated to ionized gas , their spectra may exhibit emission lines .",
    "since the starlight code deals with stellar populations , it only fits the continuum and absorption lines . as a result",
    ", the emission line features as well as possible cosmic rays are masked in the fits , and the residuals could show ionized gas emission in those clusters .",
    "global @xmath26 values computed over non - masked spectral regions are shown for bc03 and basti models .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "9 that the quality of the spectra is statistically better for bc03 models for which @xmath26 values are systematically lower .",
    "we reported in @xcite only preliminary results for 5 of the 10 clusters here analized .",
    "these results may be considered a first approach to the estimation of reddening and age values . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there are no previous data for sl142 and sl624 so that foreground @xmath0 values and ages of these two clusters are determined here for the first time .",
    "the results obtained for each of the 10 scs are briefly discussed below .",
    "table  [ tbl-5 ] presents ages and reddening values obtained after fittings with s95 templates and also with ssps bases a and b. we also list the finally adopted parameters derived by assigning different weights to the obtained values in the fits with s95 and with the ssps of bc03 .",
    "basti values are included in table  [ tbl-5 ] only as a reference , given the reasons stated in section 3 ( see fig .",
    "the errors included in the finally adopted parameters represent our estimations performed taking into account the different determinations as well as the different weights assigned to them .",
    "this is a young and compact group of stars classified by b96 as belonging to swbi type , which implies an age in the ( 10 - 30 ) myr interval .",

    "in general , all the previously reported ages for sl106 are consistent with those derived in the current study ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) . as shown in fig .",

    "the continuum distribution , the balmer jump as well as the appearance and depth of some other spectral lines are nearly identical in both spectra , with the exception of the wc emission feature in 4650 and the depth of h@xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "dds , s@xmath10 and s@xmath11 indicate that sl516 should be younger than 40 myr .",
    "this result agrees with the age of 5 myr obtained from the fitting using bc03 base and @xmath0 = 0.01 . since this match is better than the one obtained with the s95 template , we assigned heavier weight to the values inferred from using the bc03 base .",
    "ggk10 determined for sl516 an age range between 10 and 40 myr and a color excess of @xmath0 = 0.05 , both values being slightly higher than those adopted here ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "this is a small and concentrated group of stars which could be physically connected with cluster bsdl332 ( b99 ) . according to b96",
    ", sl543 is a swbiii type cluster ( 70 - 200 myr ) .",
    "ggk10 reported @xmath32 and an age between 40 and 160 myr .",
    "ews of metallic and balmer lines suggest that sl543 should be between 10 and 350 myr old .",
    "the cluster spectral features are similar to those of the yde.lmc ( 35 - 65 myr ) template from s95 , provided that the observed spectrum is previously corrected by @xmath0 = 0.11 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . these values are consistent with those determined by ggk10 . on the other hand",
    ", the fit with the bc03 synthetic spectra suggests that this an almost unreddened 102 myr old cluster .",
    "both fits imply comparable values for age but not for reddening , being bc03 match clearly better .",
    "the finally adopted values are similar to those obtained from the synthetic spectra basti base ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "as far as we know , no previous data exist for this object classified by b96 as belonging to the swb type iii ( 70 - 200 myr ) .",
    "therefore , the foreground reddening and age is here determined for the first time .",
    "the integrated spectrum of sl624 , corrected for @xmath0 = 0.10 , exhibits good agreement with the yef.lmc template of ( 50 - 110 ) myr ( fig .",
    "4 ) . note that this template covers a limited spectral range ( see sl142 ) .",
    "when the fittings using bc03 base were performed , we found that the residual fluxes are practically zero for the whole spectral range ( fig .",
    "consequently , we adopted an age of ( 110@xmath3130 ) myr and @xmath0 = 0.15 .",
    "these values do not largely differ from those obtained with the s95 template ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "as part of a systematic spectroscopic survey of scs in the lmc , we present in this paper flux - calibrated integrated spectra in the optical range for a sample of 10 blue concentrated scs located in the inner disc and in the outer regions of the lmc .",
    "we derive here both foreground @xmath0 reddening and age values through different methods , using lmc template matching and fitting ssps with two different models .",
    "judging from the @xmath26 values , the matches between the observed and the synthetic spectra using ssps from the bc03 base are noticeable better than those resulting from using the basti base .",
    "sl142 and sl624 have not been previously studied so that the parameters determined here are the first of their kind .",
    "the derived parameters for the remaining 8 clusters show , in general terms , good agreement with those determined in previous studies .",
    "cluster reddening values were also derived from available interstellar extinction maps , only for comparison purposes . with the exception of three clusters ( sl134 , sl425 and sl498 ) , we find a satisfactory agreement between the @xmath0 color excesses derived from template matching and the extinction maps , the mean difference ( in absolute value ) being @xmath33@xmath0 = 0.08 mag .",
    "the differences found for sl134 , sl425 and sl498 may be related to the fact that at least two of them ( sl134 and sl498 ) are clusters embedded in nebulosity .",
    "three of the observed scs ( sl428 , sl498 and sl516 ) turned out to be very younger than 5 myr , whereas the remaining seven proved to be moderately young with ages between 10 and 240 myr .",
    "the cluster spectra will later be used to generate new template spectra with the typical metallicity of the moderately young ( @xmath29 1 gyr ) lmc population .",
    "a star cluster spectral library at the lmc metallicity level can be useful for analyses of scs in dwarf galaxies observable by means of ground - based large telescopes .",
