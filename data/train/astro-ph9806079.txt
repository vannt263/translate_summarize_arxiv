    "the gravitationally - lensed seyfert-2 galaxy fsc 10214 + 4724 has been the subject of extensive study in all accessible wavebands since its discovery ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1991 ) . initially thought to be the most luminous galaxy in the universe , it became increasingly clear that gravitational lensing was at least partly responsible for its ultra - high luminosity [ matthews et al .",

    "1996 ] . in parallel with this ,",
    "the debate continued about the relative contributions of the seyfert-2 and starburst components to the spectral energy distribution , a debate which is still on - going [ e.g.  rowan - robinson et al .",

    "1998 ( paper ii ) ] .",
    "this latter controversy has assumed particular importance recently with the inference of an apparent peak in the star formation rate of the universe at @xmath9 deduced from the uv fluxes of high redshift galaxies ( madau , pozetti & dickinson 1996 ) . based on this",
    ", we might expect all massive galaxies at @xmath9 to be associated with star formation rates about ten times greater than in the local universe ( i.e.  a few solar masses per year for a @xmath10 galaxy ) , consistent with the value obtained from the narrow h@xmath0 emission in f10214 + 4724 ( serjeant et al .",
    "we do not , however , necessarily expect to find the extremely high star formation rates that are implied by the far - infrared luminosity of f10214 + 4724 if a large fraction of it is due to a starburst .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility that a large amount of star formation in the high - redshift universe is hidden by dust ( and therefore missed from uv - based estimates ) is suggested by the discovery of an infrared background ( guiderdoni et al .",
    "1997 ) and by results of infrared and submm surveys ( rowan - robinson et al .  1997 ; smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) .",
    "the nuclear regions of agn with their dense , dusty neutral tori wrapping the central object may turn out to be ideal sites for hiding substantial starbursts .",
    "the gravitational lensing of f10214 + 4724 also offers us an opportunity to examine the inner regions of a luminous narrow - line agn at high effective spatial resolution .",
    "the arc of f10214 + 4724 is believed to consist of three merged images within a total arc length of 0.7 arcsec .",
    "the total magnification of the arc is @xmath11 , and because the lensing is modelled well by an isothermal potential ( eisenhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) , the magnification of each image occurs predominately along the direction of the arc , with little magnification or demagnification perpendicular to it . so if f10214 + 4724 were not magnified , the nuclear region would have an angular size of only @xmath12 mas , corresponding to a physical size of 50 pc for @xmath13 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 and @xmath14 ( assumed throughout this paper ) .",
    "resolution of agn on this physical scale is otherwise only possible for the most nearby objects using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "in paper ii we showed that the ly@xmath0 photons from f10214 + 4724 emerge from a neutral column of @xmath15m@xmath4 , and that the 1:1 doublet ratio of ovi could be produced by absorption in the damping wings of ly@xmath16 as the emission lines propagated through this column .",
    "we further argued that the neutral column was probably within the narrow - line region itself , located at the back of radiation - bounded narrow - line clouds .",
    "we also presented the results of photoionisation modelling which pointed to the narrow - line emission arising in relatively dense , highly - ionisation narrow - line clouds .",
    "our models [ and those of soifer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ] were , however , unsuccessful in fully accounting for the weak balmer line emission and the lack of [ oii]372.7 in the spectrum .    to attempt to resolve some of the remaining questions about f@xmath1710214 + 4724",
    ", we obtained near - infrared spectra in @xmath18-,@xmath19- and @xmath20-band with the cgs4 spectrometer on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "the probable discovery of an emission line from the lensing system is discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the balmer lines , and describe how the spectra were used to estimate the relative contributions of the narrower component of h@xmath0 , associated with star formation in paper ii and the h@xmath0 from the highly - magnified inner narrow - line region ( inlr ) .",
    "we also discuss the related problem of the anomalously low h@xmath16 flux measured by us in paper ii and by others , and place a firm limit on the contribution of any broader component to the h@xmath0 flux from the broad - line region of the hidden quasar .",
    "section 5 discusses the other near - infrared lines , and section 6 the reddening towards the narrow - line region . in section 7 , features in the the rest - frame uv spectrum of f10214 + 4724 are discussed and amount of the star - formation activity in f@xmath1710214 + 4724 is estimated .",
    "having established that the balmer line flux from the inlr is very low , in section 8 we attempt to explain the observed emission line ratios from f10214 + 4742 in terms of the conventional model for seyfert-2 galaxies .",
    "section 9 discusses the properties of the clouds in the inner narrow - line region .",
    "finally in section 10 our results are summarised and some of their implications discussed .",
    "f10214 + 4724 was observed with cgs4 on the ukirt on the nights of 1996 april 16,17 and 18 in @xmath19- and @xmath20-band with the 150 line mm@xmath5 grating , and on 1997 february 1 with the 75 line mm@xmath5 grating in @xmath18-band as part of the ukirt service programme .",
    "a two - pixel ( 2.4-arcsec ) slit was used for all the observations .",
    "spectra were taken as detailed in table 1 , and were nodded along the slit by 10 or 25 pixels in the abbaabba .. sequence described by eales & rawlings ( 1993 ) .",
    "this results in positive and negative object spectra appearing on the array .",
    "various position angles were used in an attempt to detect emission lines from galaxies in the group containing the lensing galaxy .",

    "emission line fluxes for ngc1068 are from kriss et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; antonucci , hurt & miller ( 1994 ) ; snijders , netzer & boksenberg ( 1986 ) ; koski ( 1978 ) , and osterbrock & fulbright ( 1996 ) .",
    "the unusually weak [ oii]372.7 and balmer lines have been a particular problem in explaining the emission - line properties of f10214 + 4724 . rather than attempt to model the emission line ratios using a photoionisation code , as attempted by soifer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and by ourselves in paper ii , in this paper we have adopted a more empirical approach .",
    "table 4 compares the emission line ratios of f10214 + 4724 with those of the nearby seyfert-2 galaxy ngc1068 , normalised to heii 164.0 .",
    "as can be seen , the line ratios are remarkably similar , including the heii reddening diagnostic lines ( 108.5 , 164.0 and 468.6 nm ) even with no attempt at dereddening the spectra [ which in the case of ngc1068 at least is complicated by apparently wavelength - dependent extinction corrections , ( ferguson , ferland & pradhan 1995 ) and/or possible blending of the heii 108.5 line ( netzer 1997 ) ] . the strong uv lines ( e.g.  ovi , nv , civ , ciii ] ) are all well - reproduced .",
    "many of the optical line ratios are also very similar to within a factor of two ( e.g.  [ neiii ] , [ oiii]500.7 ) with the exception of the hydrogen lines , and lines having critical densities @xmath22 ( [ oii]372.7 , [ sii]671.7/673.1 ) which are suppressed by factors @xmath23 .",
    "lines with @xmath24 ( [ nii]654.8/658.4 , [ oiii]495.9/500.7 ) are low by factors @xmath25 , but not very discrepant given the typical range in line ratios ( simpson & ward 1996 ) and the uncertainty in the differential reddening between the two objects .",
    "[ nev]342.6 is higher in f10214 + 4724 by a factor of @xmath26 , but there is a general trend for all the ne lines to be brighter than their counterparts in ngc1068 , and so it may be at least partly accounted for by an enhanced ne abundance relative to ngc1068 .    on this basis",
    "it seems likely that the low @xmath27 lines are being suppressed because the nebular density in a typical cloud , @xmath28 , probably because lensing is preferentially magnifying the inlr where the cloud densities are higher . in the simpson & ward ( 1996 ) model ,",
    "the cloud densities are @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance from the nucleus .",
    "the ionisation parameter is therefore independent of the distance from the nucleus , which helps to explain why magnification of the inlr has not produced a much higher ionisation spectrum than that for normal luminous seyfert-2s .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the hst spectrum of ngc1068 taken by caganoff et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using a 0.3-arcsec ( @xmath31 pc ) aperture centred on the uv continuum peak .",
    "although few line fluxes are given in the paper , we have attempted to measure line ratios from their plot . within this small aperture , the degree of ionisation as measured by",
    "the [ nev]342.6:[neiii]368.9 ratio seems higher that in our spectrum of f10214 + 4724 ( 1.8 compared to 1.3 ) and also higher than in the wide aperture ( @xmath32 arcsec@xmath33 ) spectrum of ngc1068 in table 4 ( 0.8 ) , which contains a factor of 9.4 more h@xmath16 flux .",
    "this suggests a departure from the @xmath34 law , in the sense that the density is decreasing more slowly with radius than @xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless , a change in the [ nev]342.6:[neiii]368.9 ratio of only a factor of 2.3 in an order of magnitude difference in aperture size suggests that the approximation of constant @xmath36 with radius is probably not too bad .",
    "the caganoff et al .",
    "spectrum has weaker [ oii]372.7 and [ sii]671.6/673.2 emission relative to heii 468.6 than for the ngc1068 spectrum through the larger aperture by factors of @xmath25 and @xmath37 respectively , and also a weaker h@xmath16 line by a factor of @xmath25 . from the [ oii ] doublet ratio caganoff et al .",
    "estimate @xmath38m@xmath39 , about an order of magnitude less than we estimate for f10214 + 4724 , and this seems consistent with a less dramatic suppression of the low @xmath27 and balmer lines in the inlr of ngc1068 than in that of f10214 + 4724 , despite the higher ionisation of the small aperture ngc1068 spectrum .",
    "we can probably rule out the alternative possibility that the lower ionisation lines are suppressed due to their being formed at the edge of the narrow - line clouds and therefore not being lensed by as large a factor . as discussed in section 7 , magnification near a caustic @xmath40 .",
    "the inlr is @xmath41pc from the nucleus , very large compared with the thickness of the ionised layer , only @xmath42 m for a density @xmath43m@xmath39 .",
    "thus differential magnification of the ionisation structure of individual clouds is unlikely to affect the observed line ratios .",
    "the low levels of the h lines present a bigger problem . in paper",
    "ii we discussed the possibility of suppressing ly@xmath0 through resonant scattering in an hi column , and used the velocity splitting of the ly@xmath0 components to estimate the column density . in this paper we have further shown that both the h@xmath0 and h@xmath16 fluxes from the inlr are very weak , resolving the problem of having discrepant reddening estimates from the h and he lines , but we still need to explain the general weakness of the balmer lines .",
    "we now consider three possibilities to help explain the lack of balmer lines : ( i ) the balmer lines are optically thick , ( ii ) the balmer lines are weakened by underlying absorption , and ( iii ) the inlr has a very high metallicity . possibility ( ii ) can probably be completely discounted as we see no balmer break in either our @xmath18-band spectrum or that of soifer et al .",
    "possibility ( iii ) can probably also be ruled out as we would not expect to see the heii : metal emission line ratios to be so similar to those in ngc1068 , which has much brighter h lines .",
    "this leaves optical thickness of the balmer lines as the only remaining explanation .",
    "as we now show , it seems plausible as the balmer line optical depth is indeed significant .",
    "davidson & netzer ( 1979 ) show that the optical depth to h@xmath0 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 at the line centre is the cross - section of the @xmath46 state to an h@xmath0 photon , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are factors of order unity , @xmath49 is the flux of ionising photons , @xmath50 is the optical depth to the ly@xmath0 line and @xmath51 is the einstein @xmath52-coefficient of the @xmath53 state . assuming a dimensionless ionisation parameter @xmath54 and a hydrogen density @xmath55m@xmath39 gives @xmath56 , so @xmath57 .    according to paper ii the minimum column density in hi required to produce",
    "the observed ly@xmath0 profile is @xmath58 , which , assuming a cross section to the line centre of ly@xmath0 of @xmath59 gives @xmath60 to the line centre .",
    "thus @xmath61 .",
    "as ferland & netzer ( 1979 ) point out , however , this estimate of the optical depth needs to be interpreted carefully .",
    "most of the optical depth arises in the partially ionised region of the nebula , where the ly@xmath0 photons are being resonantly scattered and the population of the @xmath46 level is therefore highest .",
    "provided the cloud is radiation - bounded , escape of h@xmath0 photons from the illuminated side of the nebula is far more likely than escape from the non - illuminated side ( as is also the case for ly@xmath0 photons ) .",
    "thus if we are observing the clouds from the non - illuminated side , we expect the balmer and ly@xmath0 lines to be substantially suppressed .",
    "this case is therefore different to that for the uv resonance lines , e.g.  ovi and civ , which may also be optically thick in f1024 + 4724 ( paper ii ) . in the cases of these lines",
    "there are no reflecting layers to backscatter the photons : provided they are not absorbed by dust they will eventually escape isotropically .",
    "the lack of hydrogen lines in f10214 + 4724 can thus be explained as a geometrical effect .",
    "backscattering of the balmer and ly@xmath0 lines in the inlr suppresses them relative to the outer narrow - line region , where escape is easier .",
    "this effect will be most pronounced if the side of the inlr which is closest to the cusp in the lensing potential is between us and the agn ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in this geometry",
    ", we see the back sides of the most highly - magnified narrow - line clouds , through which little flux from h lines can escape .",
    "heisler , lumsden & bailey ( 1996 ) show that polarised broad lines are only detected in seyfert-2 galaxies whose torus axes are inclined relatively close to the angle at which the blr becomes visible , thought to be about 45 deg .",
    "inclination at such an angle will also improve suppression of the h lines in our backscattering model . in a normal seyfert-2 such as ngc1068 , we see brighter h lines because the outer narrow - line region is optically thin to h@xmath0 , thus enabling us to see the balmer lines from the nearside , and the contribution from the far side of the central object is larger , allowing both ly@xmath0 and balmer lines to be seen from there .",
    "it is also likely that apart from lensing , obscuration by the dusty molecular torus of the other side of the inlr helps to reduce the balmer and ly@xmath0 contributions from the far side of the central object .",
    "partial obscuration of the inlr has been used to explain the differences in [ oiii ] emission line strengths between quasars and radio galaxies ( he s , barthel & fosbury 1993 ) .",
    "( 75,65 ) ( 0,60 )",
    "given an estimate of the density , ionisation parameter and the neutral column , we can attempt to deduce the typical sizes and masses of the narrow - line clouds . the ionised column @xmath62 can be estimated from the ionisation parameter , density and ionising flux from @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the case b recombination coefficient . to this , the neutral column adds a comparable @xmath65 ( paper ii ) . hence assuming a uniform density cloud , a typical size is @xmath66pc and a typical mass is @xmath67 , a little larger than the estimates in paper ii due to our inclusion of the ionised column .",
    "we can compare our results to the theoretical predictions of mathews & veilleux ( 1989 ) who deduced from a stability analysis of the clouds in the narrow line region an @xmath68 .",
    "clouds in outflowing winds with column densities in this regime are stable to rayleigh - taylor instabilities when radiative pressure and dynamical pressure act together , yet are small enough both to ensure a covering factor @xmath69 and smooth line profiles .",
    "extinction by dust in the inner narrow - line clouds would be expected to affect the observed line ratios , particularly if , as our model predicts , we are seeing emission - line light emerging through large column densities in the narrow line clouds . from our derived column density ( ionised plus neutral ) and assuming a gas : dust ratio of @xmath70 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) , we obtain @xmath71 mag , much larger that the @xmath72 we measure ( which of course is an upper limit to the amount of reddening within the narrow - line clouds , as it does not include dust outside the nuclear region ) .",
    "the double ly@xmath0 line is also good evidence against dust in the neutral column , as even a small amount of dust would destroy ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "thus the narrow - line clouds must contain relatively low amounts of dust .",
    "even at 10 pc from the agn , we are well away from the dust sublimation point , thought to be just outside the broad - line region ( laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "the narrow - line clouds may start their lives close to the agn and then flow out , or perhaps have their dust destroyed by shocks associated with the agn .",
    "our column depths are also consistent with models in which the fully - ionised `` warm absorbers '' seen in the x - ray spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars , and possibly related to associated absorbers seen in quasar spectra , are narrow - line clouds seen close to the nucleus ( e.g.  george et al .",
    "these have typical column densities @xmath73 , but seem to be mostly dust free , and this , coupled with their short variability timescales , suggests an origin at least as close to the agn as the outer broad - line region .",
    "outflow of these clouds into the narrow - line region in a decelerating flow ( crenshaw 1997 ) would account for the lack of dust in the inner narrow - line clouds .      in common with most seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "the x - ray emission from f10214 + 4724 is weak ( lawrence et al .",
    "1994 ) , implying an absorbing hi column of @xmath74 , an order of magnitude higher than that in out narrow line clouds , and consistent with the absorption taking place in a torus of neutral gas around the agn .",
    "such a column implies a reddening @xmath75 if the gas : dust ratio is galactic , or @xmath76 if it is the same as deduced from the narrow line clouds",
    ". either would also be more than sufficient to hide the nucleus and broad - line region in the uv and optical .",
    "our studies of iras f10214 + 4724 have allowed us to plausibly resolve many of the remaining puzzles relating to this object .",
    "furthermore , the lensed nature of the galaxy has allowed us to examine the nuclear region in detail only achievable with the hst on the most nearby seyfert galaxies . with this",
    "we have been able to argue that there is a probably an intimate link between a starburst and agn in this object , namely that the starburst is occuring very close in to the nucleus , possibly in the obscuring torus . from optical depth arguments",
    "we have been able to deduce many of the properties of the narrow - line clouds in the inlr , and thus address some of the issues associated with absorption of agn spectra .",
    "5 shows the model we have chosen to adopt for the nuclear regions of f10214 + 4724 .",
    "this gives the greatest suppression of the hydrogen lines , although in fact any geometry in which the cusp falls in front of the inlr will lead to some suppression .",
    "the axis of the dusty molecular torus is inclined such that the cusp of the lensing potential falls on the side of the ionisation cone which points towards the line of sight .",
    "this enables us to scatter the lyman and balmer emission from the backside of the clouds in the highly - magnified inlr .",
    "the inlr has a similar scale size ( @xmath77pc ) as the mid - infrared source needs to have if the intrinsic luminosity is to be comparable with local ultra - luminous iras galaxies ( broadhurst & lehr 1995 ; eisenhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e.  if the magnification @xmath77 .",
    "the low density outer part of the narrow - line region has a much lower magnification , and the other side of the inlr both has a lower magnification and may be partially obscured from our line of sight by the torus .",
    "thus lines from the low density clouds in the outer narrow - line region and the balmer and ly@xmath0 lines appear anomalously weak .",
    "using the narrow - line spectrum , we can specify the properties of a `` typical '' inner narrow - line cloud .",
    "densities inferred from the suppression of emission lines of low @xmath27 are @xmath43 m@xmath39 , with an ionisation parameter of @xmath78 inferred from the relative strength of high - ionisation lines .",
    "column densities in ionised and neutral gas are predicted to be comparable if the double - peaked ly@xmath0 line is formed by propagation through the neutral backs of the narrow - line clouds .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance of emission from neutral oxygen in the spectrum , but requires the narrow - line clouds to have a low dust content .",
    "our column density estimates are consistent with the narrow - line clouds being in outflow from the nucleus , stabilised according to the mechanism of mathews & vielleux ( 1989 ) , with an origin close to the blr to account for their low dust content .",
    "when they are closest to the nucleus they may appear as warm absorbers in x - ray spectra .",
    "narrow - line profiles in agn ( including f10214 + 4724 ; see fig .",
    "3 ) almost invariably have blue wings and it has been recognised for some time that a possible explanation of this is that the clouds are outflowing , with clouds on the far side of the nucleus from the observer being partially obscured ( e.g.  osterbrock 1989 ) . the alternative , that the narrow - line clouds are infalling and dust absorption in the rear of the clouds preferentially attenuates light from the nearside of the narrow - line region can , in the case of f10214 + 4724 at least , be ruled out .      the angular magnification provided by gravitational lensing of f10214 + 4724 has allowed us to observe the emission from within the inner 100pc of the agn , scales which can usually only be studied in the most nearby objects .",
    "if our model for f10214 + 4724 is correct , the unlensed seyfert-2 galaxy is remarkably similar to the most luminous local examples .",
    "the detection of polarised broad lines , an associated compact starburst and nuclear radio emission all have precedents at low redshift .",
    "f10214 + 4724 is seen at a redshift close to the apparent peak in star formation activity in the universe , and has a uv component very reminiscent of the lyman break galaxies ( e.g.  lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) , although much more reddened .",
    "once corrected for lens magnification the star formation rate deduced from the h@xmath0 and uv fluxes is only a factor of a few to ten higher than predicted in the average massive galaxy at these epochs , although in the case of f10214 + 4724 it is confined to a very small region near to the nucleus .",
    "the evidence for dust both from the h@xmath0/h@xmath16 line ratio and the slope of the uv spectrum is strong though , and it is quite plausible that much of the evidence for star formation could be hidden in the uv and optical , appearing only as an infrared excess .",
    "thus although the optical / uv evidence for a starburst in f10214 + 4724 is fairly convincing , on the basis of our observations alone we can not tell which of the starburst or the agn dominates the mid - infrared flux .",
    "surveys for objects like f10214 + 4724 are already succeeding .",
    "the iso study of the hubble deep field ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ) has found several @xmath79 galaxies with mid - infrared excesses indicative of dust shrouded starbursts , and recently , ivison et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have announced the first detection of a high-@xmath80 galaxy discovered with the scuba submm instrument , smm 02399 - 0136 , discovered as part of a survey behind the galaxy cluster a370 ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ) . like f10214 + 4724",
    ", this galaxy is a narrow - line agn with relatively weak ly@xmath0 emission and blueshifted uv absorption features , including civ and siiv , and possibly siii152.7 ( although this looks more likely to be part of a broad absorption line trough from civ ) .",
    "however , smm 02399 - 0136 has a much stronger broad ciii]1909 component and no splitting of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "also , the best estimates of the effects lensing for both objects make smm 02399 - 0136 significantly more luminous than f10214 + 4724 .",
    "apart from possibly siii there are no other low ionisation uv features , and this , combined with the larger broad ciii ] component suggests that smm 02399 - 0136 may be a little closer to `` face on '' than f10214 + 4724 .",
    "the effects of differential magnification of the outer and inner nlrs in smm 02399 - 0136 will be much less due to the much smaller magnification gradient in the cluster lens , so an infrared spectrum of this object should show more normal line ratios .",
    "the lack of a split in the ly@xmath0 line could be due to more isotropic radiation from the outer nlr contributing to the centre of the profile .    hidden or patially hidden star formation in the obscuring tori of type-2 agn may turn out to be common , and metal - rich outflows from these regions ( for which we have evidence in f10214 + 4724 )",
    "may stimulate starbursts in the remainder of the galaxy ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "it is clear though from studies of f10214 + 4724 that disentangling the starburst , agn and possibly lensing contributions to the observed infrared fluxes from similar objects discovered in future surveys will prove to be a major challenge .",
    "this may become possible , for example through very high resolution imaging using interferometers working in the submm .",
    "if so , selection in the far - infrared / submm should prove to be much more reliable than uv flux for tracing the star formation history of the universe",

    "<S> we use new high resolution near - infrared spectroscopy and our previously - published optical spectroscopy of the gravitationally - lensed seyfert-2 galaxy f10214 + 4724 to study both the links between the starburst and agn in this object and the properties of the line - emitting clouds in the inner narrow - line region . </S>",
    "<S> close inspection of the rest - frame uv spectrum reveals interstellar or stellar absorption features consistent with a compact , moderately - reddened starburst providing about half the uv light , and explaining the dilution of the uv continuum polarisation relative to the broad emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy of the h@xmath0/[nii ] line blend has enabled us to assess the relative contributions of the emission from the narrow - line region of the seyfert-2 , and a moderately - reddened emission line region which we argue is associated with the starburst activity . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the star formation rate from the unpolarised uv continuum flux and the h@xmath0 flux are consistent to within their associated uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we find we can plausibly explain the unusual emission line properties of f10214 + 4724 in terms of conventional models for nearby seyfert-2 galaxies if lensing is preferentially magnifying the side of the inner narrow - line region between the agn and the observer , and the other side is both less magnified and partially obscured by the torus . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen densities of clouds in this region are high enough to make the balmer lines optically thick and to suppress forbidden emission lines with low critical densities . from the emission - line spectrum </S>",
    "<S> we have deduced the column density of both ionised and neutral gas in the narrow - line clouds , and the density of the ionised gas . using these </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to estimate the mass of the inner narrow - line clouds to be @xmath1 , and show that the gas : dust ratio @xmath2 in these clouds must be @xmath3m@xmath4mag@xmath5 , significantly higher than average value in the milky way , @xmath6m@xmath4mag@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the column density and low dust content of a typical cloud are consistent with the properties of the warm absorbers seen in the x - ray spectra of seyfert-1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus favour models in which the narrow - line clouds start life close to the nucleus and flow out . an emission line from the lensing system </S>",
    "<S> has allowed us to confirm its redshift as @xmath7 .    </S>",
