    "biological membranes are multi - component assemblies typically composed of lipids , cholesterol , glyco - sugars , and proteins , whose presence is indispensable to the normal functioning of living cells  @xcite . given the complexity of biological membranes , studies of model membranes have been conducted _ in vitro _ in order to gain insight on the structural and physical behavior of biomembranes .",
    "many studies , in particular over the last two decades , have focused on simplified artificial systems containing vesicles in solution , composed of ternary mixtures of lipids and cholesterol  @xcite . by decreasing temperature",
    ", the ternary mixtures undergo a phase separation between a liquid - ordered ( l@xmath0 ) phase and a liquid - disordered ( l@xmath1 ) one  @xcite . depending on thermodynamical parameters ,",
    "the liquid domains show one of three distinct domain shapes : _ flat _ , _ dimpled _ ( partially budded ) , or _ fully - budded _  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical model for domain - induced budding of planar membranes was proposed by lipowsky  @xcite , and later was extended for the case of closed vesicles  @xcite . in the model , the competition between membrane bending - energy and domain line - tension leads to a budding transition under the constraint of fixed domain area .",
    "et al_.  @xcite proposed a mechanism based on this interplay , which stabilizes patterns of several domains on closed vesicles without requiring any osmotically induced membrane tension .",
    "returning to the case of planar membranes , lipowsky s model  @xcite predicts that : ( i ) an initially flat domain deforms spontaneously into a completely spherical bud when the initial domain size exceeds a critical size ; and ( ii ) dimpled domains are stable only when the spontaneous curvature of the bilayer membrane is nonzero .",
    "the latter prediction was later re - examined  @xcite , because dimpled domains are observed experimentally in vesicles with no apparent spontaneous curvature  @xcite . in order to resolve this discrepancy , rim _",

    "@xcite considered the effect of adding an overall lateral tension acting on the membrane , and used ideas about entropy - driven lateral tension that were originally proposed by helfrich and servuss  @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase diagram  @xcite contains regions of stability for the three different domain morphologies as mentioned above .",
    "moreover , the effect of the lateral tension on budding was discussed by lipowsky and coworkers  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the budding process requires that the activation energy has to exceed the energy barrier associated with the surface tension .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a model that describes domain - induced budding in bilayers composed of a binary mixture of lipids .",
    "we suggest that dimpled domains can be formed and remain stable due to a possible asymmetry between the two monolayer compositions .",
    "we show that the dimpled structure appears when the line tension along the domain rim is not too large .",
    "global phase diagrams are calculated within mean - field theory and , in some range of system parameters , we obtain a tricritical behavior as well as three - phase coexistence region .",
    "we discuss different morphologies that characterize the phase diagrams in terms of model parameters .",
    "it has been recognized long time ago that such an asymmetry in monolayer composition leads to a nonzero bilayer spontaneous curvature  @xcite .",
    "the coupling between composition and monolayer curvature was also considered  @xcite in order to describe the transition between lamellar and vesicular phases of bilayer membranes composed of two types of amphiphiles .",

    "@xcite , the phase separation is assumed to occur only in one of the monolayers , and the domain spontaneous curvature due to the compositional asymmetry is kept constant . for finite spontaneous curvatures , it was shown that the dimpled domains are obtained in equilibrium when both line and surface tensions are small  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ring - shaped domains were experimentally obtained in model membranes by using a bud - mimicking topography  @xcite .",
    "such a ring - shaped domain is located around a bud - neck region having a negative curvature , and is characterized by the composition asymmetry between the two monolayers .",

    "we present a model for bilayer domains . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] includes some discussion and interpretation of our results .",
    "we model the membrane as a bilayer having two monolayers ( leaflets ) , each composed of an a / b mixture of lipids that can partition themselves asymmetrically between the two monolayers .",
    "we consider the case where the lipids can undergo a lateral phase separation creating domains rich in one of the two components .",
    "as discussed below , these domains can also deform ( bud ) in the normal direction , and the deformations are controlled by the membrane curvature elasticity . because we do not include any gradient terms in the free energy , it results in an unrealistic discontinuous jump of the membrane curvature close to the bud edge .",
    "for the fully - budded state this jump in curvature does not matter because the bud neck corresponds to a small length scale of the order of the membrane thickness .",
    "however , in the dimpled state , this jump occurs on a bigger length scales and artificially affects the free energy .",
    "we will further introduce a coupling between local lipid composition and local curvature  @xcite , which can eventually drive the budding process of the membrane .",
    "we start by considering a single two - dimensional ( 2d ) circular domain of an initial and arbitrary radius @xmath2 embedded in an otherwise flat ( 2d ) membrane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the area of the domain , @xmath3 , is assumed to stay constant even when the domain buds into the third dimension . for simplicity",

    "the total bending energy of the budded domain is given by adding the curvature contributions from the two monolayers  @xcite : @xmath5 , \\label{bend}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the bending rigidity modulus and @xmath7 the monolayer spontaneous curvature .",

    "we assume that each of the monolayers is incompressible , hence , @xmath16+@xmath21 .",
    "for simplicity sake , the molecular areas of a and b species are taken to be the same , meaning that the molar fraction of the lipids is indenting to their area fraction . as in any a / b mixture , the possibility of a phase separation due to partial incompatibility between the two species can be described by a phenomenological landau expansion of the free energy in powers of @xmath22 around the critical point , @xmath23 . in our case , this expansion is done separately for each monolayer , and the free energy is the sum of the two contributions : @xmath24 , \\label{phase}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the invagination length , @xmath26 a parameter that sets the energy scale , @xmath27 the reduced temperature ( @xmath28 being the critical temperature ) , and @xmath29 the chemical potential that fixes the a / b relative composition in each layer . in general , a different chemical potential can be assigned to each of the two monolayers . however , since it is difficult to control the average composition in each layer separately , we introduce only one chemical potential @xmath29 that fixes the total relative composition @xmath30 of the entire bilayer . notice",
    "that we allow exchange of lipid molecules between the two monolayers via a flip - flop process .",
    "bilayers where each of the monolayer compositions can be controlled independently will be addressed in our future work .",

    "[ fig11 ] , where we present the stability regions for each of these three phase behaviors in the ( @xmath45 , @xmath37 ) plane .",
    "type i is characterized by the existence of a dimpled phase , and has a triple point where the d , b and f phases coexist . in type ii ,",
    "the tricritical points exist but the triple points and the d phase disappear .",
    "type iii is dominated by various b phases , with coexistence regions between them that terminate at a critical point .",
    "the crossover line between type ii and iii behaviors is almost a straight line , while the crossover line from type ii to i is almost linear for @xmath117 , and then saturates at about @xmath118 .",
    "this saturation occurs when the coupling is strong ( large @xmath37 ) and/or the domain size is small ( large @xmath45 ) . at these values , budding is promoted because of the large spontaneous curvature .",
    "when @xmath45 decreases , for a fixed value of the coupling parameter @xmath37 , the b phase swells and the d phase disappears , signaling the crossover between type i and ii . upon further decrease of @xmath45 , only the b phase stays , i.e. , crossover between type ii and iii . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger @xmath37 is , the larger is the spontaneous curvature that favors the fully - budded state .",
    "for this reason , at higher values of @xmath37 , the system buds at lower temperatures for the same value of @xmath45 .",
    "we have proposed a model that accounts for domain budding of lipid bilayers , where each of the bilayer leaflets has a coupling between its local curvature and local a / b lipid composition .",
    "the composition asymmetry between the two leaflets is equivalent to the introduction of a membrane spontaneous curvature .",
    "this spontaneous curvature is not taken to be fix ( as was assumed in previous works ) , but is calculated and depends on the asymmetry in leaflet composition .",
    "hence , due to this extra mechanism of generating a spontaneous curvature , dimpled domains can be stabilized even for bilayers with a nominal zero spontaneous curvature .",
    "our free - energy model contains three contributions : bending energy accounting for domain deformation in the normal direction , line tension along the rim of the budded or flat domain , and a landau free - energy expansion that accounts for a lateral phase separation of the binary lipid mixture .",
    "we assume that the domain area remains constant during the budding process .",
    "our model predicts three states for domain as were observed experimentally : fully - budded ( b ) , dimpled ( d ) and flat ( f ) states . in particular , in some range of parameters ,",
    "the d state is found to be the most stable one .",
    "the obtained results indicate that for a certain range of temperatures , monolayer composition , domain size and coupling between curvature and composition , a triple point can appear . at the triple point ,",
    "the b , d and f phases coexist , each with its own composition .",
    "such a triple point has been reported already by harden _",
    "et al . _",
    "moreover , we also found a tricritical point that corresponds to the intersection of a critical ( second - order ) line , which joins a first - order phase transition region between f and d. finally , three types of phase diagram morphologies are found and analyzed in terms of the coupling parameter @xmath37 and domain size @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "formation of domains in membranes and their understanding remain an open and ever - challenging problem , even after an intense research in the last two decades .",
    "many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the domain appearance and their possible structure and function  @xcite .",
    "one of the important assumptions in our model is that the domain size @xmath2 and area @xmath119 remain fixed during the budding process .",
    "domains of fixed size can be obtained in thermodynamical equilibrium for a binary mixed membrane that undergoes a lateral _ micro - phase separation _ , and forms a 2d modulated phase with an equilibrated spatial periodicity  @xcite .",
    "this a micro - phase separation can be driven by a coupling between local lipid composition and membrane curvature , leading to a curvature instability  @xcite , as was in particular discussed in refs .",
    "when the a / b average lipid composition is off - critical , circular domains rich in one of the lipid can form spontaneously and be arranged in a hexagonal array , embedded in a background rich in the second lipid .",
    "these circular domains are characterized by their equilibrium fixed size , and can undergo a budding process as explored in the present work .",
    "formation of finite - size domains in equilibrium can also be explained by the presence of hybrid lipids having one saturated tail and a second unsaturated one  @xcite .",
    "such hybrid lipids decrease the domain line tension  @xcite and offer another potential mechanism to induce micro - phase separation . in a previous work",
    "@xcite , we considered a model that includes a coupling between a compositional scalar field and a 2d vectorial order parameter .",
    "this coupling yields an effective 2d free energy that exhibits micro - phase separation and resulted in a modulated phase .",
    "a somewhat different viewpoint of membrane domains has been recently discussed by shlomovitz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who investigated a general phenomenological model capable of producing macro - phase separation , micro - phase separation , and microemulsion - like phases . in these works ,",
    "the characteristic length of compositional modulations is responsible for the origin of finite - size domains that are equilibrium structures .",
    "these types of domains can undergo the budding transition as we have discussed in this paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "when _ macro - phase separation _ takes place in mixed membranes , the domain size grows to macroscopic sizes as function of time , and the assumption of fixed domain size becomes more questionable .",
    "however , if the shape transformation of domains occurs on time scales much faster than the time required for domain coarsening , one can still use our equilibrium argument for domain morphologies whereby we regard the domain size @xmath2 and , hence , the invagination length @xmath45 , as time dependent .",
    "in fact , the slowdown of dimpled - domains coarsening was experimentally observed  @xcite and theoretically discussed  @xcite . according to these works",
    ", the suppression of the phase separation may be caused by membrane - mediated elastic interactions and/or hydrodynamic interactions acting between domains .",
    "our model with its assumption of fixed domain size can also be applied in such situations .",
    "a dynamical growth of the budding domain size was proposed  @xcite to occur in two steps , when the spontaneous curvature is not too large . in the early stage",
    "the domains are small and the diffusion - aggregation phenomenon induces a growing dimpled domain until its size becomes unstable .",
    "whereas in the later stage , the domains are large enough to fully bud into a sphere that detaches completely from the planar membrane at the neck point .",
    "in other words , the budded domain curves mainly during the second step .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with these predictions .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that , for small values of @xmath37 and for small domain sizes ( large @xmath120 ) , the typical phase diagram is of type i for which the dimpled state appears as a stable phase .",
    "as the domain size becomes larger ( smaller @xmath45 ) , the typical phase diagram will change to either type ii or iii so that the membrane can bud easily .",
    "in contrast , for large values of @xmath37 , the dimpled state can not be stable . in this case",
    ", the domain will retain a highly curved state already in the early stage of the phase separation , and the budding can occur only in one step .    finally , our model may be applied to describe the formation and growth of vesicles in mixed amphiphilic systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , it was observed in experiment that mixtures of anionic and cationic surfactants in solution form disk - like bilayers for some range of relative surfactant composition .",
    "as these disk - shaped bilayers grow in size , they transform into spherical caps and eventually become spherically closed vesicles .",
    "such a sequence of morphological changes was indeed observed by cryo - tem ( transmission electron microscopy )  @xcite .",
    "in such a setup , it is likely that the spontaneous curvature of bilayer membranes are induced due to the compositional asymmetry between the two monolayers .",
    "hence , one can expect that disks , caps , and vesicles can be analyzed similarly to the flat , dimpled , and fully - budded phases in our model .",
