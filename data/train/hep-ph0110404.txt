    "<S> the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons is usually described considering the two - gluon ( pomeron ) exchange , non - diagonal parton distributions and the contribution of the real part to the cross section . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the diffractive photoproduction of the @xmath0 at hera using an alternative model , the color evaporation model ( cem ) , where the cross section is simply determined by the boson - gluon cross section and an assumption for the production of the colorless state . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that , similarly to the @xmath1 case , the hera data for this process can be well described by the cem . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we propose the analyzes of the ratio @xmath2 to discriminate between the distinct approaches .    the successful operation of the hera @xmath3 collider has opened a new era of experimental and theoretical investigation into diffractive vector - meson photo- and leptoproduction . on the experimental side </S>",
    "<S> , the hera accelerator extends the accessible energy range by more than one order of magnitude over previous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the hera data show that the cross sections for exclusive vector - meson production rise strongly with energy when compared to fixed - target experiments , if a hard scale is present in the process . on the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> vector - meson production has proven to be a very interesting process in which to test the interplay between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of qcd ( for a review , see for example @xcite ) . while in inclusive process , as open heavy flavor production , the cross section is described in terms of a perturbative term associated to the cross section of the partonic subprocess , and a nonperturbative term represented by the parton distributions , an analogous factorization of hard and soft physics does not apply to quarkonium production rates @xcite , which constitute a small fraction of the total open flavor cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this makes quarkonium physics a challenging field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the current picture in the literature to describe the diffractive photo- and leptoproduction of vector - mesons assumes that the color singlet property of the meson is enforced at the perturbative level by the two - gluon ( pomeron ) exchange @xcite . in this approach the amplitude , in the target rest frame , </S>",
    "<S> is factorized as a sequence of events very well separated in time : ( i ) the photon fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ; ( ii ) the @xmath4 pair scatters on the proton target , and ( iii ) the scattered @xmath4 pair turns into a vector meson . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is mediated by the exchange of two gluons in a color - singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the two gluon exchange amplitude can be shown to be proportional to the gluon distribution @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 center of mass energy and @xmath10 is the invariant mass of the @xmath11 system . in the case of the production of a heavy meson </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of the heavy meson mass ensures that perturbative qcd can be applied even in the photoproduction limit . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been improved , particularly in the role of the vector meson light cone wave function @xcite , describing reasonably the hera @xmath12 data . when applied to the recent hera @xmath13 data @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it only reproduces the data if new effects , which significantly contribute , are considered @xcite : ( a ) the non - diagonal parton distributions , which probe new nonperturbative information about hadrons and are a generalization of the conventional parton distributions ( for a review see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) ; and ( b ) the real part of the scattering amplitude . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a strong correlation between the mass of the diffractively produced state and the energy dependence of the total cross section was found , implying a distinct energy dependence for the @xmath13 and @xmath12 photoproduction . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main motivations for the study of diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons in the pomeron model is the possibility of obtain a sensitive probe of the behavior of the gluon distribution , due to the quadratic dependence on the gluon distribution @xcite of the cross section in this model .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative view of the diffractive photoproduction process was proposed recently in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the @xmath12 photoproduction was analyzed using the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the color singlet is not enforced at the perturbative level and the cross section for the process is given essentially by the boson - gluon cross section plus an assumption for formation of the colorless meson . </S>",
    "<S> in the cem for the diffractive photoproduction the cross section is linearly proportional to the gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these authors have obtained a parameter free prediction which describes very well the hera @xmath12 data .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we extend the application of the cem for the recent hera @xmath13 data and verify that , using the parameters determined in @xmath14 hadroproduction , this model reasonably describes the experimental data with no need to introduce a colorless ( pomeron ) exchange at the perturbative level , as well as , non - diagonal parton distributions or the contribution of the real part of the scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we propose the analyzes of the ratio @xmath15 to discriminate between the distinct approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start from a brief review of the color evaporation model ( cem ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main uncertainties in the quarkonium production is related to the transition from the colored state to the colorless meson . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the @xmath11 pair will in general be in a color octet state . </S>",
    "<S> it subsequently neutralizes its color and binds into a physical resonance . color neutralization occurs by interaction with the surrounding color field . </S>",
    "<S> if we enforce that a colorless object is already present at the perturbative level then a hard interaction with the surrounding color field is assumed , and a minimal of two gluons should be exchanged with the proton ( pomeron models ) . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the colorless object is produced at the nonperturbative level , then there is not a minimal restriction in the number of gluons exchanged with the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the cem provides a simple and general phenomenological approach to color neutralization ( see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in cem </S>",
    "<S> , quarkonium production is treated identically to open heavy quark production with exception that in the case of quarkonium , the invariant mass of the heavy quark pair is restricted to be below the open meson threshold , which is twice the mass of the lowest meson mass that can be formed with the heavy quark . for bottomonium </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit on the @xmath16 mass is then @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the cem assumes that the quarkonium dynamics is identical to all bottomonium states , although the @xmath16 pairs are typically produced at short distances in different color , angular momentum and spin states . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronization of the bottomonium states from the @xmath16 pairs is nonperturbative , usually involving the emission of one or more soft gluons . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the quantum numbers of the initial @xmath16 pair and the final state bottomonium , a different matrix element is needed for the production of the bottomonium state . </S>",
    "<S> the average of these nonperturbative matrix elements are combined into the universal factor @xmath18 $ ] , which is process- and kinematics - independent and describes the probability that the @xmath16 pair binds to form a quarkonium @xmath19 of given spin @xmath20 , parity @xmath21 , and a charge conjugation @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath23 has been fixed for each state ( @xmath13 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) the model successfully predicts the energy and momentum dependence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the elastic @xmath0 photoproduction at hera , the cem predicts that the cross section is given by @xmath26 = f[nj^{pc } ] \\,\\,\\overline{\\sigma}[b \\overline{b } ] \\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the large distance factors @xmath23 can be written in terms of the probability @xmath27 to have a color singlet pair after the soft interactions , times the fractions @xmath28 of total bottomonium carried by the different states , in a similar way as considered in @xcite , where the corresponding @xmath29 factors for charmonium are claimed to be universal . </S>",
    "<S> the short distance contribution is @xmath30 = \\int_{2m_b}^{2m_b } dm_{b\\overline{b } } \\,\\,\\frac{d\\sigma[b\\overline{b}]}{dm_{b\\overline{b } } } \\,\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{cross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 $ ] is the spin- and color - averaged cross section for open heavy quark production , which describes the boson - gluon fusion process @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the invariant mass of the @xmath16 pair , @xmath34 is the bottom quark mass and @xmath17 is the @xmath35 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section for the boson - gluon subprocess is well known ( see eq . ( 4 ) in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the expression at leading order ) . </S>",
    "<S> this will contribute to elastic photoproduction , since in lo all energy of the photon is transferred to the pair . </S>",
    "<S> higher order corrections will be mostly important for the inclusive and the inelastic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the soft interactions have a double effect - to eliminate the color of the pair , allowing quarkonium production , and to allow elastic production with a single perturbative gluon exchange , by having soft gluon exchanges taking place in the non - perturbative part of the process .    in cem , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of these soft interactions is implicit in the non - perturbative factors . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit modeling for the soft gluon exchanges is done in the sci model @xcite , which is based essentially in the same general idea . in that model , by requiring either rapidity gaps or leading proton in the final state , it was obtained explicitly a good description of several diffractive processes , including diffractive and open beauty production in the tevatron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that soft gluon exchanges really might play a role in diffraction .    </S>",
    "<S> the cem has been used to predict the production of @xmath13 in hadron and nuclear processes @xcite , with the parameter @xmath18 $ ] determined from the quarkonium production experimental data at fixed - target energies . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable feature of the cem is that this model also accounts ( within @xmath36 factors ) for the quarkonium production at the tevatron @xcite . as the fixed target @xmath14 data </S>",
    "<S> have generally given the sum of @xmath13 , @xmath24 and @xmath37 production , due to the low mass resolution to clearly separate the peaks , only the global factor @xmath38=0.044 $ ] has been determined . </S>",
    "<S> this is an effective value which reflects both direct production and chain decays of higher mass states . as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , isolation of the direct production cross section for each @xmath39 requires the detection of the radiated photons associated with chain decays , which is not currently available but might be possible at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> considering some assumptions related to the decay chain the following values for @xmath23 in direct @xmath39 production have been estimated @xcite : @xmath40=0.023 $ ] , @xmath41=0.02 $ ] , @xmath42=0.0074 $ ] , where the @xmath43 superscript indicates the @xmath23 for direct production . in our formalism </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 factors can be related to the @xmath29 factors by the simple relation @xmath44 , where the @xmath27 is the probability to have the pair in a color singlet state after the soft gluon exchanges , and @xmath28 are the universal factors with give the fractions of the onium cross section carried by the different onium states . </S>",
    "<S> their corresponding values are , from above , @xmath45=0.207\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\rho^d[\\upsilon ^{\\prime } ] = 0.18\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\rho^d[\\upsilon ^{\\prime \\prime } ] = 0.066\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once the free parameters have been determined in the hadronic processes , we can use the cem to predict the @xmath13 photoproduction at hera . </S>",
    "<S> this also follows the assumption used in @xcite that the production ratios of @xmath0 , @xmath46 and @xmath37 are the same as those measured in hadron - hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a comment is in order here . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the @xmath13 hadroproduction has been calculated considering the next - to - leading order contributions for the cross section , which implies that the factor @xmath23 determined from data does not contain perturbative contributions beyond leading order and can be considered an universal factor which describes the probability for quarkonium production . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the calculations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have used the mrs d@xmath47 parton densities as input , but as demonstrated in @xcite , where an update from the analyzes of the @xmath14 suppression for the cms detector was made , the @xmath13 data can be equally well described using the grv 94 lo @xcite parton densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section @xmath48 $ ] is computed at leading order using the grv 94 lo @xcite parton densities with @xmath49 gev , @xmath50 gev and the renormalization and factorization scales set to @xmath51 @xcite , with @xmath52 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show our predictions for @xmath14 photoproduction at hera energies . both the total @xmath53 and direct @xmath13 production are presented , since the cross sections measured by the zeus and h1 collaborations did not select the direct @xmath13 state , but rather the data were integrated over an interval of the @xmath54 mass which includes at least the @xmath13 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that the current experimental data does not allow to discriminate the distinct contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our results are completely parameter free and that the cem model reasonably describes the scarce experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of the cem strongly contrasts with the number of assumptions necessary in the pomeron models to describe the same set of data . </S>",
    "<S> here we proposed a signature to discriminate between these models . as we have quoted above , </S>",
    "<S> the pomeron models predict a stronger growth in energy for the diffractive @xmath13 photoproduction than in @xmath12 photoproduction , due to the strong correlation between the mass of the diffractively produced state and the energy dependence of the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the cem model the growth of the cross section is directly determined by the gluon distribution @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the factorization scale . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath57 can be used to discriminate between models .    as an intermediate step to calculate the mentioned rate , </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] our previous calculation of @xmath58 , contrasted with the more recent hera data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that these data can be reasonable explained without tuning the parameters , which were taken as the previously used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives one more clue that the cem can be used to explain elastic @xmath59 photoproduction .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we present the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath60 calculated using the cem , where @xmath61 represents the direct @xmath14 production and we have used the results from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and from above to calculate @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that this ratio is almost constant in the kinematic range of hera , in contrast to the pomeron model @xcite , where a steep rise of the ratio is predicted [ cf . ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio was also obtained in @xcite , where the value predicted agrees with data within errors for the mrs gluon , but underestimates the result for the steeper grv gluon . in our case , the @xmath63 ratio agrees with the lower bound observed by zeus @xcite for both mrs and grv gluon parameterizations .    </S>",
    "<S> the original motivation of the study of diffractive photoproduction was the possibility to extract the gluon distribution inside the proton . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dependence on the gluon distribution is one of the major differences between the descriptions of the diffractive photoproduction using either the pomeron model or the cem . whereas the pomeron model has a quadratic dependence on @xmath64 , this dependence is linear in the cem . </S>",
    "<S> our result demonstrates that before to extract the gluon distribution from hera @xmath0 and @xmath1 data , one should determine the correct description for this process , for example by measuring the energy behaviour of the @xmath65 ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> the cem describes a large range of data in hadro- and photoproduction , as shown in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . using this model , </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we obtain a parameter free description of the elastic @xmath13 photoproduction at hera energies . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that this simple model reasonably describes the experimental data , similarly to the pomeron models . as a distinct feature between these models , </S>",
    "<S> the cem predicts a softer energy dependence of the ratio between the @xmath13 and @xmath66 cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> of course , when more precise data become available , the discrimination between these models should be possible , which will allow us to conclude whether the cem is only an alternative phenomenological model for the current energies or it contains some underlying non - perturbative dynamics which is important in both diffractive and non - diffractive quarkonium production . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> more theoretical studies are necessary to understand the soft interactions in the process of color neutralization . </S>"
