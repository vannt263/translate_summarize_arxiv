    "search for an abundant , inorganic and non - toxic material with good absorption coefficient at relatively low thicknesses in solar cell applications has narrowed down to tin sulphide ( sns ) @xcite .",
    "sns has been successfully fabricated by chemical methods @xcite-@xcite , spray pyrolysis @xcite-@xcite , sputtering @xcite , thermal evaporation @xcite,@xcite- @xcite and electron beam assisted evaporation @xcite .",
    "the band - gap of the films were reported to lay between 1.3 - 2.5  ev @xcite,@xcite-@xcite depending on the fabrication technique . with band - gap laying in this range , sns is capable of utilizing the visiable range of solar radiation falling on the earth s surface .",
    "literature shows that the present efforts are directed towards finding an appropriate second layer for the diode formation with sns .",
    "the best efficiency reported is 4.4% with zinc oxysulphide , zn(o , s ) , acting as the n - layer @xcite .",
    "annealing @xcite and/or sulphurization @xcite of the sns layer has also been suggested to improve the sns solar cell s efficiency . however , directed fundamental characterization of sns films especially on presistant photoconductivity is absent .",
    "in fact a search of the literature only shows a couple of articles on sns presistant photoconductivity @xcite . considering a long carrier lifetime ( in relation to photoconductivity )",
    "would assist in improving the photovoltaics preformance @xcite , an indepth corelation of carrier lifetime with film parameters is a must .",
    "we have tried to address this in the present work .",
    "the present work reports the fabrication of p - type sns thin films via thermal evaporation method on glass substrate maintained at room temperature .",
    "characterization of the films shows that the properties , both electrical and optical , are strongly related to the orientation of the unit cell which inturn depends on the film thickness .",
    "thin sns films of varying thicknesses were grown at rates greater than 2  nm / sec on microscopy glass substrate maintained at room temperature by thermal evaporation of sns pellets at vacuums better than @xmath0  torr using a hind high vac ( 12a4d ) coating unit .",
    "the starting material was sns powder of 99.99% purity provided by himedia ( mumbai ) .",
    "the thicknesses of the films were measured using dektak surface profiler ( 150 ) .",
    "bruker d8 x - ray diffractometer with copper target ( @xmath1 radiation , @xmath2 ) and transmission electron microscopy ( technai t30u twin ) was used to determine the structure / crystallinity of the samples .",
    "the surface morphology of the samples was compared using a field emission - scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem fei - quanta 200f ) at an accelerating voltage of 10  kv .",
    "the optical studies of the films were recorded using an uv - vis double beam spectrophotometer ( systronics 2202 ) .",
    "hot - spot probe method was used to determine the conductivity type of the films , which without exception showed that the as - grown films were p - type in nature .",
    "the photoconductivity experiments were carried out at room temperature using a source meter smu-01 of marine ( india ) .",
    "a tungsten lamp was used as our light source .",
    "contacts were made using silver paste which is known to give good ohmic contacts with sns @xcite",
    "fig  1 shows the x - ray diffractograms of various samples whose thickness lie between 450 to 1680  nm . all the peak positions matched with those listed in astm card no  79 - 2193 for sns , having orthorhombic structure with lattice constants @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as can be seen from the x - ray diffractograms",
    "there is a change in orientation with increasing film thickness .",
    "texture coefficient was estimated to determine the preffered orientation of crystallites in the as - deposited films using the formula @xmath6",

    "this is evaluated using the intensity of the ( hkl ) plane ( @xmath8 ) obtained experimentally from the x - ray diffractograms while @xmath9 is the intensity listed in the astm card for the corresponding ( hkl ) peak and ` n ' is the total number of diffraction peaks obtained in x - ray diffraction . preferential orientation ( hkl ) plane would have large texture coefficient compared to the other planes .",
    "we obtained @xmath10 and @xmath11 for 450  nm and 1680  nm films respectively , showing a shift from ( 005 ) orientation to ( 200 ) as film thickness increases .",
    "the miller indices suggests that the film s orientation moves from ` xy ' layers parallel to the substrate ( i.e. ` c ' or the long axis perpendicular to the substrate ) to an orientation where the ` xy ' layers are perpendicular to the substrate ( long/ ` c ' axis parallel to the substrate ) .    -0.5",
    "cm    to confirm the crystalline nature of the grown films , we did a selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) analysis of our 650  nm sample using a transmission electron microscope ( fig  2 ) .",
    "the sharp rings confirm the crystallinity of our samples .",
    "the inner most ring corresponds to ( 111 ) plane , while the second and third ring correspond to the ( 203 ) and ( 115 ) peaks of our x - ray diffractograms ( fig  1 ) , the ( 111 ) peak did not show in xrd .",
    "the sem micrographs show two different morphologies , where thinner films showed spherical grains and thicker films exhibited ` needle ' shaped morphology ( fig  3 ) .",
    "the needle shaped morphology @xcite-@xcite is typical when the ` c ' or long axis is parallel to the substrate , thus confirming our assertion made while interpreting our x - ray diffraction results .",
    "the grain size of the sns samples were determined from the xrd peaks according to the scherrer s formula @xcite @xmath12 where ` d ' is the grain size , @xmath13 is the wavelength of the x - ray used ( @xmath14 ) , fwhm is full width at half maximum intensity of the diffraction peaks and @xmath15 is the bragg s angle .",
    "fig  4 shows the variation of grain size with film thckness .    -0.5",
    "cm    initially , the grain size increases with the thickness however , on reaching a maximum value it shows a decreasing trend with the film thickness .",
    "co - relating with our sem micrographs , we find that it is at this  point of inversion \" thickness that the grain morphology changes from spherical to needle - shaped .",
    "to study this variation in grain size with changing morphology , lattice parameters were calculated using the following formulae @xcite @xmath16 where a , b , c are the lattice parameters and ( hkl ) are the miller indices reported in the astm card .",
    "it was observed that a residual stress acts along the ` c - axis ' of the orthorhombic sns unit cell while the lattice parameters ` a ' and ` b ' were same as reported in the astm card indicating no stress along these directions . the strain along the ` c ' direction can be estimated using @xmath17 where ` @xmath18 ' is the experimentally obtained long lattice parameter and ` @xmath19 ' is that of a single crystal .",
    "the study of strain with film thickness shows an interesting trend ( fig  5 ) .",
    "films with spherical grains show tensile strain ( or tensile residual stress ) which increases with film thickness .",
    "infact it shows a near parabolic trend with film thickness , with rate of change shallowing as thickness increases ( lines in fig  5 are for visual aid ) .",
    "this may explain the increase in grain size with film thickness .",
    "however , the films with the needle - shaped grains show compressive stress acting on it . the magnitude of residual stress seem to be constant with film thickness .",
    "the variation in residual stress with film thickness would indicate that the nature of residual stress changes with the long ( ` c ' ) axis changing its orientation from perpendicular to the substrate ( tensile stress ) to parallel to the substrate ( compressive stress ) .",
    "this curve suggests that the change in orientation takes place in films of thicknesses greater than 1160  nm .      -0.6",
    "cm    to study the photoconductivity of the films , the characteristics of the sample s measured with them exposed under a tungsten bulb .",
    "interestingly , the resistivity of the thicker films ( @xmath20 ) were found to be very high ( beyond the measuring capability of the instrument ) .",
    "similiar observation was made by wang et al @xcite .",
    "considering that there is a sudden change in resistivity as the film thickness is increased beyond 1160  nm , we believe this exceptionally high resistivity is related to the grain orientation ( as seen in our structural analysis , thicker samples have ` xy ' plane perpendicular to the substrate ) .",
    "sinsermsuksakul et al  @xcite have shown that the mobility of charge carriers is significantly lower along the direction of van der waals forces . hence , with electrodes made on the film s surface , we can appreciate the high resistance in thick sns samples .",
    "`` sensitivity '' ( s ) is usually used as a figure of merit while discussing the photoconductivity of films and is given as @xcite-@xcite @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the films conductivity measured when exposed to light ( l ) and in dark ( d ) respectively .",
    "sensitivity , hence is a measure of how much conduction increases in a sample with light intensity .",
    "the increase in conductivity maybe due to an increase in charge carriers @xcite or due to change in mobility @xcite . from the charge carriers generated on illumination , a part would recombine with the respective opposite charges , thereby reducing the barrier potential at grain boundaries .",
    "this inturn would lead to an increase in the charge carrier s mobility .",
    "this is called grain boundary modulation @xcite .",
    "the photoconductivity is given as @xcite @xmath24 where ` p ' is the charge carrier concentration ( here restricted to holes considering p - type material is under discussion ) and ` q ' charge associated with single charge carrier , while @xmath25 is the carrier s mobility .",
    "fig  [ fig.sens ] shows the variation of sensitivity with intensity for four different thicknesses ( less than 1160  nm ) of polycrystalline samples whose grain size were different .",
    "as can be noticed , all the experimental data irrespective of the grain size follows the same trend .",
    "this would suggest that the sensitivity of p - sns is independent of grain size , thus ruling out barrier modulation @xcite .",
    "thus , any increase in conductivity is due to increase in photo - conductors or carriers created by illumination .",
    "the above equation reduces to @xmath26    fig  [ fig.sens ] is also indicative of the fact that sensitivity is dependent on the illumination intensity .",
    "in fact it is functionally given as  @xcite @xmath27 where ` i ' represents the illumination intensity .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath28 can be evaluated from the slope of the straight line obtained when fig  [ fig.sens ] is plot on a logarithmic scale . for our data",
    "we obtain @xmath29 , where @xmath30 indicates existence of traps within the bandgap and also the presence of bimolecular recombination ( recombination on band - gap transition ) @xcite .    -0.4",
    "cm    the existence of traps can also be appreciated from the rise and decay of photo - current .",
    "photo - current decay ( pcd ) measurements of our samples were made by applying a constant bias of 10v across them . before illumination , the samples were maintained in dark for @xmath31 .",
    "the photo - current was measured during illumination for @xmath32 , followed by which we observed the current decay under the dark .",
    "measurements were made till the original dark current was achieved .",
    "unlike sensitivity , two trends were obtained , for ( a ) thinner samples ( @xmath33 ) and ( b ) thicker samples ( @xmath34 ) .    the vertical rise and drop in current upon switching illumination on and off respectively is a result of charge carriers crossing the band - gap with no contribution of traps . whereas , the exponential rise and decay is trap assisted photo - current .",
    "the trap assisted photo - current or the persistant photoconductivity ( ppc ) is dominant in thinner samples as compared to the thicker samples , as is evident by the larger vertical change regions of the curve .",
    "the persistant current is given by the equation @xcite as @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the initial dark current , @xmath37 the decay - time constant and @xmath38 represents the stretching exponent constant ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 values obtained by curve fitting are listed in table  i. the large decay time indicates existence of trap centers within the forbidden band - gap of the film @xcite .",
    "these trap centers increases the carrier life - time @xcite in the as - grown p - sns thin films .",
    "we find the charge carrier life - time systematically decreases as film thickness increases .",
    "considering an increased life - time implies a reduced recombination rate allowing more time for the carriers to move without recombination , the material with long carrier life - time and good sensitivity would be a useful material for photovoltaics @xcite .",
    "* table i : * _ decay time constants of various films obtained by curve fitting eqn  ( 5 ) to photo - current data .",
    "_    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        -0.6 cm    the refractive indices of the films were evaluated for different wavelengths using the standard swanepoel s method @xcite from the transmission spectra of the samples .",
    "swanepoel s method involves drawing envolopes connecting the extrema points of the the interference fringes appearing in the transmission spectra ( see fig  [ fig.refind ] ) .",
    "interestingly , these fringes did not appear in samples whose thickness was more than 1160  nm . again , like our observation made on photoconductivity , films with thicknesses above 1160  nm coinciding with structural orientation change , shows a marked change in behavior . in this study , due to lack of fringes in thicker samples and limitations imposed by the technique , we report the variation of refractive indices seen in just three of our samples .    the inset ( a ) of fig  [ fig.refind ] shows the variation of refractive indices of the three samples with wavelength .",
    "the disperive trend of the three films look similiar .",
    "in fact the trend follows the sellmeir relation @xcite ( curve fits have co - relation of 0.998 ) given below : @xmath40 sellmeir model pictures the solid to be made of dipole oscillators with ` j ' natural oscillation frequencies , given by @xmath41 ( in above equation @xmath42 ) .",
    "interestingly , our results suggest sns film s consist of single oscillators , all oscillating at frequencies corresponding to energies within 2.72 - 2.83  ev .",
    "this is well above the sample s known band - gap ( which we shall discuss below ) , however the sellimeir ",
    "oscillators \" do not absorb away from the natural frequencies ( our data is restrict for @xmath43 ) and have zero broadening of the lorentz absorption peak .",
    "this implies that the refractive index is a real number with @xmath44 .",
    "table  ii gives the coefficients of eqn  [ sell ] that fit to the experimental results which can be used for model fitting during ellipsometric studies .",
    "an increasing ` b ' with film thickness suggests that the refractive index of the samples increases with film thickness for all wavelengths ( see inset b of fig  [ fig.refind ] ) .",
    "while our data clear shows that the refractive index fits sellmeir s model , previous works have reported sns follows cauchy s dispersion relation @xcite and wemple - didomenico single oscillator model for refractive index @xcite .",
    "* table ii : * _ comparison of properties of sns based solar cells from the literature listed in order of increasing efficiency . _      -0.6 cm    the absorption spectra of the as - grown sns films were studied in the wavelength range 300 - 900  nm .",
    "the band gaps of the films were evaluated from the absorption spectrum using tha standard tauc method @xcite .",
    "although sns is reported to have both direct and indirect band - gaps  @xcite , we obtained straight line fits only for plots between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see inset of fig  [ fig.eg ] ) , where`@xmath47 ' is the absorption coefficient and @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that our p - sns as - grown films have allowed direct band - gap  @xcite .",
    "the band - gap shows an exponential decrease with film thickness attaining the value of bulk samples ( @xmath48 @xcite-@xcite ) for thicknesses greater than 1500  nm .",
    "tin sulphide ( sns ) thin films were fabricated by thermal evaporation on glass substrates maintained at room temperature .",
    "the films were found to be nano - crystalline with layered structure , whose layers were found to be either parallel to the substrate or perpendicular to it depending on the film thickness . the orientation was found to have an effect on the film s morphology and its properties , such as electrical conductivity .",
    "the poor conductivity of thicker films caused by layers being perpendicular to the substrate made it impossible to study the photoconductivity of these samples . however , thinner samples showed good photo - sensitivity and we observed presistant photoconductivity in them .",
    "this indicates the existence of traps within the forbidden energy gap of thin samples .",
    "the charge carrier s life time was found to decrease with increasing film thickness .",
    "this would imply an improved photovoltaic performance in very thin samples of sns with charge carriers reaching their respective electrodes without recombination .",
    "the optical studies showed a 2.2  ev band - gap for the thinner sns films with large refractive index following sellmeir s dispersion relation , ideally suited for simple photovoltaics and plasmonic photovoltaics using sns as the absorbing layer .",
