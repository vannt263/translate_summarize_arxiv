    "as the energy of an electron abruptly changes at the interface , the characteristics of devices that include such interfaces directly depend on the height of emerging energy barriers .",
    "originally , the concept of a heterojunction was associated with a contact between two semiconductors , but currently its use is significantly expanded to include dielectrics .",
    "for example , in solving the actual problem of replacing the sio@xmath1 gate dielectric in silicon field - effect transistors with a material with higher dielectric constant , the calculation of the tunneling current through the gate dielectric requires an accurate knowledge of the energy diagram of the formed heterojunction .    in the last decade",
    ", experimental studies have discovered a number of new physical phenomena occurring at the interface of two oxide dielectrics .",
    "these include the appearance of a quasi - two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface of two dielectrics  @xcite and its superconductivity ;  @xcite the magnetism at the interface of two non - magnetic oxides .",
    "@xcite the ability to control the conductivity of the 2deg with an electric field ( an analog of the field effect )  @xcite and so to control the temperature of the superconducting phase transition  @xcite were demonstrated .",
    "the strongest conductivity changes were observed when one of the oxides was ferroelectric .",
    "@xcite when the components of heterostructures were magnetic and ferroelectric oxides , the ability to control the magnetic properties of the structure with a switchable ferroelectric polarization was shown .",
    "@xcite thus , these heterostructures acquired the properties of a multiferroic .",
    "the above - mentioned and other interesting phenomena observed in oxide heterostructures open new opportunities for developing of new multifunctional electronic devices and suggest the emergence of a new direction in microelectronics , the oxide electronics .",
    "@xcite    the development of the ferroelectric memory devices is one of the applications of the ferroelectric oxides .",
    "it requires to solve the problem of non - destructive read - out of information and to increase the packing density of the memory cells . for",
    "non - destructive optical read - out methods , the memory cell size is limited by the wave length . for titanates with the perovskite structure ,",
    "in which the typical band gap is @xmath23  ev , the minimum cell size is @xmath24000   . in multiferroics ,",
    "in which the information is stored electrically and read out magnetically , the memory cell size can be reduced to the size typical for modern hard disks , @xmath2500   ( in homogeneous multiferroic thin film , the physical size of the memory cells is limited by a rather large width of magnetic domain wall ) .",
    "the methods based on the electrical read - out of the ferroelectric polarization are the most promising .",
    "since the physical size of the ferroelectric memory cells is limited by the thickness of the ferroelectric domain wall and the minimum film thickness for which the ferroelectricity still exists ( both sizes are a few unit cells  @xcite ) , the packing density of the memory cells in these devices is maximized .",
    "these methods can be based , for example , on the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics which are reversible upon switching the polarization in the metal  ferroelectric ",
    "metal structures as demonstrated on thin films of pzt  @xcite and bifeo@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite a similar behavior can be observed on the structures that use the tunneling through a thin layer of ferroelectric .",
    "@xcite    the most important physical parameters that characterize an interface between two semiconductors or dielectrics are the band offsets on the energy diagram of the heterojunction .",
    "the valence band offset @xmath4 ( the conduction band offset @xmath5 ) is defined as the difference between the energies of the tops of the valence bands ( bottoms of the conduction bands ) in two contacting materials .",
    "these band offsets determine a number of physical properties of heterojunctions , in particular , their electrical and optical properties .    for oxides with the perovskite structure ,",
    "the reliable experimental data on the band offsets ( obtained by the photoelectron spectroscopy ) exist for heterojunctions srtio@xmath3/si ,  @xcite batio@xmath3/si ,  @xcite srtio@xmath3/gaas ,  @xcite batio@xmath3/ge ,  @xcite srtio@xmath3/inn ,  @xcite batio@xmath3/inn ,  @xcite srtio@xmath3/zno ,  @xcite batio@xmath3/zno ,  @xcite srtio@xmath3/sro ,  @xcite and batio@xmath3/bao .",

    "in addition , there are data on the schottky barrier heights for perovskite  metal structures , in which the metals are pt , au , ag , or the conductive oxides srruo@xmath3 and ( la , sr)coo@xmath3 .    in this work",
    ", the band offsets for nine heterojunctions between titanates , zirconates , and niobates with the cubic perovskite structure are calculated from first principles using the density functional theory and @xmath0 approximation .",
    "the obtained results are compared with available experimental data .",
    "the band offsets can not be determined from a direct comparison of the energies of the valence and conduction bands obtained from the first - principles band - structure calculations performed separately for two constituent bulk materials .",
    "this is because in the first - principles calculations , there is no intrinsic energy scale : the energies corresponding to the valence band edge @xmath6 and to the conduction band edge @xmath7 are usually measured from an average of the electrostatic potential , which is an ill - defined quantity for infinite systems .",
    "consequently , in addition to the band - structure calculations for two materials , the lineup of the average of the electrostatic potential @xmath8 between them should also be calculated .",
    "the latter value is determined by the dipole moment emerging at the heterojunction as a result of the redistribution of the electron density on the hybridized orbitals in the constituent materials .",
    "it takes into account all the features typical of the interface , such as the change in the chemical composition , the structure distortions , etc .",
    "thus , the valence band offset can be represented as a sum of two terms :  @xcite @xmath9    the first term in this equation is the difference of the energies corresponding to the tops of the valence bands in two bulk materials . it can be obtained from standard band - structure calculations .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is the lineup of the average of the electrostatic potential through the heterojunction . to calculate @xmath8 ,",
    "one usually starts from the total potential ( the potential of the ions plus the microscopic electrostatic hartree potential for electrons ) obtained from the self - consistent electron density calculation in a superlattice constructed of the contacting materials .",
    "after that , the macroscopic averaging technique  @xcite is applied , in which the electrostatic potential is first averaged over planes parallel to the interface and then the convolution of the obtained one - dimensional quasi - periodic function with two rectangular windows whose lengths are determined by the periods of components is calculated .",
    "the resulting profiles of the macroscopic average of the electrostatic potential @xmath10 have flat ( bulk - like ) regions far enough from the interface .",
    "the @xmath8 value is defined as the difference energy between these plateau values .",
    "it should be noted that neither the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quantities , nor @xmath8 does not have physical meaning themselves , only the sum , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , is meaningful .",
    "the conduction band offset is calculated from the @xmath4 value and the difference of the band gaps in two materials : @xmath13    roughly , the band gap @xmath14 can be estimated in the lda approximation for the exchange - correlation energy . however , because of the well - known band - gap problem characteristic of this one - electron approximation , more accurate calculations should take into account the corrections to the band energies resulting from many - body effects . these corrections ( the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 )",
    "are usually calculated in the quasiparticle @xmath0 approximation .",
    "it is usually believed that many - body corrections adjust the position of the conduction band and in this way solve the band - gap problem , however , the energy levels in the valence band are also corrected .    in the case of well - studied materials ,",
    "the @xmath5 value is often calculated from the experimental band gaps . however ,",
    "if the band offset @xmath4 was obtained theoretically , the problem associated with the uncertainty in the @xmath16 values remains .",
    "it is often assumed that the @xmath16 values in two materials are close , so that their contributions to the band offsets cancel each other . in this work , we show that this assumption in general is not true .    it should be also noted that , since the position of the energy levels in a crystal depends on the interatomic distances , the calculation of @xmath11 , @xmath17 , @xmath12 , and @xmath18 should be carried out under the same strain of materials , which appears in a heterojunction . besides the strain - induced lifting of the degeneracy of the band edges , the band gap itself can vary .",
    "moreover , the calculations should take into account the possible lifting of the band degeneracy resulting from spin - orbit interaction . although the structure of dielectrics  the lattice parameters and equilibrium atomic positions  are weakly dependent on the spin - orbit interaction ( and therefore it is usually neglected in the calculations ) , in the band structure calculations , the spin - orbit interaction strongly affects the energy position of the bands , and it can not be neglected . in dielectrics ,",
    "the taking into account of the spin - orbit interaction can be done _ a posteriori _ , after completion of the main first - principles calculations .",
    "the objects of the present calculations were heterojunctions formed between titanates and zirconates of calcium , strontium , barium , and lead as well as the knbo@xmath3/nanbo@xmath3 heterojunction .",
    "they were modeled using superlattices grown in the [ 001 ] direction and consisted of two materials with equal thickness of layers , each of four unit cells .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameter was obtained from the condition of zero stress at the interface ( i.e. , it was close to the lattice parameter of the solid solution with the component ratio of 1:1 ) ; the period of the superlattice and atomic displacements normal to the interface were fully relaxed .",

    "biaxial strain of these compounds during the formation of the heterojunction ( their in - plane lattice parameters become equal ) , reduces the symmetry of their unit cells to @xmath31 . as a result ,",
    "their band gaps are changed and the degeneracy of the energy levels at some points of the brillouin zone are lifted .",
    "for example , the threefold degeneracy of the conduction band at the @xmath32  point and that of the valence band at the @xmath33  point are lifted ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these band extrema locations are typical for all compounds studied in this work except for pbtio@xmath3 and pbzro@xmath3 . in cubic pbtio@xmath3 ,",
    "the top of the valence band is at the @xmath34  point , and the tetragonal distortion removes the valley degeneracy ( depending on the sign of the strain , the valence band edge is located at either @xmath34 or @xmath35  point of the brillouin zone of the tetragonal lattice ) . in cubic pbzro@xmath3 , the only compound in which both band extrema are located at the @xmath34  point , the strain also removes the valley degeneracy , but both extrema remain at the same point of the brillouin zone ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) .",

    "@xcite in all studied crystals , the spin - orbit split - off conduction band at the @xmath32  point is always shifted to higher energies , and so the absolute minimum of the conduction band at the @xmath32  point is shifted down by @xmath36 .",

    "the final energy diagram of the heterojunction obtained after taking into account the spin - orbit interaction is shown by two internal diagrams in fig .",
    "we note that in these calculations , we have neglected the weaker effects associated with the change of the band splitting ; they result from the strain - induced mixing of different states and can be seen in fig .",

    "the tests showed that when the thickness of the individual layers in the batio@xmath3/srtio@xmath3 superlattice was changed from three to five unit cells , the variation in the @xmath8 value computed by the above algorithm was only @xmath24  mev , which gives an estimate of the error in the @xmath8 calculation .",
    "as shown in ref .  , the many - body effects do not influence much on the @xmath8 value .",
    "the results of the band offsets calculations for nine heterojunctions are given in tables  [ table1 ] and  [ table2 ] .",

    "] we note that the band offsets predicted in this work are in much closer agreement with experiment compared to the results of ref .",
    "( @xmath41  ev , @xmath42  ev ) .",
    "as the experimental srtio@xmath3/srzro@xmath3 structure  @xcite was grown on srtio@xmath3 substrate , the calculated band offsets , which depend on the in - plane lattice parameter , may be slightly different ( this dependence is well known for semiconductor heterojunctions  @xcite ) . to estimate these changes ,",
    "the calculations for the srtio@xmath3/srzro@xmath3 heterojunction were repeated for the in - plane lattice parameter equal to that of srtio@xmath3 .",
    "they gave @xmath43  ev and @xmath44  ev , which somewhat worsened the agreement with experiment .",
    "it should be stressed that the results obtained in this work are for heterojunctions formed between _",
    "cubic _ compounds .",
    "we deliberately did not take into account possible distortions of the perovskite structure , which obviously affect the energy diagram of heterojunctions .",
    "this is because the question about the character of these distortions is not so simple .",
    "it is known that the character of distortions in the perovskites may change significantly under the biaxial strain and , moreover , the distortions in two materials usually are highly interconnected .",
    "these effects are well known for ferroelectric superlattices .",
    "@xcite in heterojunctions between polar materials , the need to meet the electrical boundary conditions ( equal electric displacement fields normal to the interface ) causes the polarization in both constituent materials to differ from their equilibrium values .",
    "since the accompanying atomic displacements affect the band gap and the positions of the band edges , in polar heterojunctions the band offsets can be very different from those in nonpolar structures .",
    "in addition , the cases are known when the periodic domain structure can occur in a ferroelectric near the interface .",
    "@xcite predicting of the energy diagram for such a system is particularly problematic .",
    "the experimental data for the srtio@xmath3/pbtio@xmath3 heterojunction  @xcite are noticeably different from the results of our calculations . according to the photoelectron spectroscopy data , this heterojunction is type  ii and the band offsets are @xmath45  ev and @xmath46  ev ( in pbtio@xmath3 the valence band lies higher than in srtio@xmath3 ) . according to our calculations , the band offsets are + 0.384 and @xmath400.100  ev , respectively , and the heterojunction is type  i. we see that in experiment and calculations , the signs of @xmath4 are the same , but their values differ considerably .",
    "the fact that the crystal structure of pbtio@xmath3 at 300  k is tetragonal can not explain such a large discrepancy .",
    "a possible explanation is given below .    if the interface is not perfect ( for example , in the case when the structural relaxation of strained materials occurs , as one can see in refs .  ) , the dangling bonds are created near the interface and the surface states appear in the electronic structure .",
    "these states are electrically active and can significantly disturb the @xmath8 value , and so to change @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , in the relaxation region where the lattice parameter depends on the coordinate , an additional drift of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 values ( the band bending ) occurs .",
    "the distortion of the energy diagrams similar to that arising from the surface states can occur in heterojunctions between highly defective materials .",
    "like the levels of the surface states , defects in constituent materials can exchange electrons with each other , which would distort the energy diagram of a heterojunction .",
    "the size of the region in which such an exchange occurs is about the screening length in a material and can be quite small .",
    "for example , in a dielectric with a defect concentration of @xmath47  @xmath48 , the length of the impurity screening can be as small as 43   .",
    "@xcite it is possible that the strong discrepancy between the calculated and experimental band offsets in the srtio@xmath3/pbtio@xmath3 heterojunction results from the presence of defects in materials : the band offsets observed in this heterojunction correspond to the case where the defect levels in two contacting materials are close in energy .",
    "@xcite even stronger distortions of the band diagram can be characteristic of heterostructures between perovskites with so - called valence discontinuity , such as srtio@xmath3/laalo@xmath3 ( ref .  ) and",

    "we have studied , three closed chains ( contours ) can be formed in which the initial and the terminal components are the same : srtio@xmath3/pbtio@xmath3/batio@xmath3/srtio@xmath3 , batio@xmath3/pbtio@xmath3/pbzro@xmath3/bazro@xmath3/batio@xmath3 , and srtio@xmath3/pbtio@xmath3/pbzro@xmath3/bazro@xmath3/batio@xmath3/srtio@xmath3 .",
    "the positions of the valence bands calculated from the obtained @xmath4 values for one of these chains is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . when traversing the contour , we never get zero ( see the figure ) , the deviation is from @xmath400.027 to + 0.539  ev .",
    "this means that the transitivity rule is not applicable .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that in heterojunctions , the band offsets actually depend on the in - plane lattice parameter .",
    "@xcite if the lattice parameter in all the members of the chain would be the same , then traversing the contour would result in zero @xmath6 shift .",
    "however , because all heterojunctions in the above chains have different lattice parameters , the result is nonzero .",
    "thus , in general , the transitivity rule is untenable , and the corresponding error can exceed 0.5  ev .",
    "in this work , the band offsets for eight heterojunctions between titanates and zirconates of calcium , strontium , barium , and lead as well as for the knbo@xmath3/nanbo@xmath3 heterojunction with the cubic perovskite structure were calculated from first principles .",
    "the effect of strain in contacting oxides on their energy structure , many - body corrections to the position of the band edges ( calculated in the @xmath0 approximation ) , and the splitting of the conduction band resulting from spin - orbit interaction were consistently taken into account .",
