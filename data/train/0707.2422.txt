    "we are primarily interested in obtaining the excitation spectrum of the system .",

    "this is a non - trivial result due to the complicated behaviour of the quasi - momenta in the complex plane in the attractive case ( see section [ quasi ] ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this work is the first example of calculations made on excited states of this system ( with more than 3 particles ) without any truncation of the hilbert space and without restricting oneself to the limiting _ string _ solutions .",
    "the string solutions arise in the case where the interatomic interactions are sufficiently attractive , or alternatively in the zero density limit .",
    "the problem reduces to one solved by mcguire  @xcite and elaborated upon in references  @xcite .",
    "the point of interest in our numerical solutions is the deviations of the quasi - momenta from these previously known solutions .",
    "our present work extends our understanding of quantum solitons from the large boson numbers in optical fibres towards the much smaller numbers possible in atomic systems .",
    "related work has been performed by oelkers and links  @xcite , who concentrate on a toroidal lattice governed by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "physically one expects the results of their calculations to tend toward those of the continuum as the number of lattice sites increases .",
    "the bose - hubbard hamiltonian is , however , non - integrable and it has been shown by seel _",
    "_  @xcite that the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg chain ( which is integrable ) maps onto the 1d bose gas model in the continuum limit .",
    "other examples of lattice hamiltonians that have the 1d bose gas in the continuum limit can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we review the work of lieb and liniger  @xcite in order to correctly pose the problem . in section [ quasisect ]",
    "we discuss our method of solution and present the results , whilst also discussing its connection to earlier work by mcguire  @xcite . in section [ exc_spect ] we present the excitation spectrum of the system obtained from our calculations , and in section [ comparison ] we show a comparison of our work to that of the truncated hilbert space approach of reference  @xcite .",
    "finally we calculate the excitation spectrum for the repulsive case in section  [ sec : repulsive ] , before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we are considering a system of @xmath2 bosons , each with a mass @xmath3 , on a ring of radius @xmath4 , in the limiting case of the radial confinement _ freezing _ out all the transverse degrees of freedom of the atoms .",
    "the interactions are assumed to be short range , contact interactions , modelled using the delta function . with these assumptions",
    "the system will be described by the hamiltonian ( in first quantised formalism ) @xmath5 where length is measured in units of @xmath4 and energy is measured in units of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the angular coordinate of the @xmath8th particle ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is related to the s - wave scattering length by eq .  , and quantifies the strength of the two body interactions , @xmath10 describes an attractive gas while @xmath11 describes a repulsive gas .",
    "since our spatial universe is of course three dimensional it is worthwhile to note the physical limits of applicability of this model . assuming harmonic confinement , the length scale of the dimensions tranverse to the ring are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "another important length scale is the s - wave scattering length , @xmath14 , that represents the strength of two body interactions .",
    "the healing length of the gas @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the three dimensional density , reveals how sensitive the gas is to irregular features in the potential . for the system in which we are interested , it is possible to define a _",
    "local _ set of cartesian coordinates such that @xmath17 , where the @xmath18 axis runs tangential to ring .",
    "essentially this amounts to a torus of radius @xmath4 and cross - sectional area @xmath19 satisfying the condition @xmath20 . in this way",
    "the energy level spacings for the tranverse ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) degrees of freedom supersede all other energy scales within the system and the system is essentially one dimensional .",
    "therefore we can assume a ground harmonic oscillator state in the transverse dimensions , and integrate them out to obtain an effective one dimensional interaction  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath3 is the mass of a single particle .",
    "some interesting work has recently been done by parola et .",
    "@xcite on the quasi - one dimensional limit which indicated a transverse collapse ( in addition to the angular collapse ) at a certain critical interaction strength . in this work they took into closer consideration the effects of the excluded two dimensions .",
    "current experimental realisations of such ring traps  @xcite are still far from the quasi-1d regime  @xcite .    given the hamiltonian , schrdinger s equation is @xmath24 where @xmath16 is the label for different eigenstates .",
    "equation   can be solved exactly via the bethe ansatz  @xcite . due to the symmetry under permutation of particle coordinates , the region over which we need to integrate eq .",
    "can be restricted to @xmath25 .",
    "lieb and liniger noted that in this region the delta function vanishes everywhere except along the boundaries where @xmath26 , hence the problem could be cast in a different manner by writing the interactions as a _",
    "boundary condition _ on the restricted region rather than an explicit term in the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the new problem was to find the appropriate solution to @xmath27 where eq .",
    "is the previously mentioned boundary condition arising from the interaction .",
    "furthermore the boundary conditions pertaining to the ring geometry of the system , i.e. @xmath28 , must also be recast onto the new region , vis    [ bc ] @xmath29    the bethe ansatz is employed as a means of integrating eq .  .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) wave function in the restricted region is given the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is some permutation of the integers @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the @xmath34th element in @xmath31 and the sum runs over all the @xmath35 distinct permutations of @xmath31 .",
    "equation is one form of the bethe ansatz and was originally used as a means of integrating spin chain hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of each permutation , @xmath36 , can be determined ( up to some arbitrary phase ) by the interaction boundary condition eq .  .",
    "we choose the convention @xmath37 and for any other permutation @xmath31 , @xmath36 is found by constructing @xmath31 out of @xmath38 by transposing adjacent elements .",
    "then @xmath36 is a product of the terms @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the adjacent elements being transposed , with @xmath40 to the left of @xmath41 _ before _ the transposition .",
    "the scalar quantities @xmath42 , known as the _ quasi - momenta _ ( and sometimes the rapidities ) , are determined by the ring geometry of the system , i.e. , by the boundary conditions in eqs .  .",
    "these quasi - momenta furnish important quantities for the system such as the energy eigenvalues and the total momentum , however it should be stressed that ( other than the case of no interactions @xmath43 ) the individual quasi - momenta do not have a direct relationship to the single particle momentum states . the latter must be obtained from the single particle reduced density operator , which can be obtained from the many body wave function .",
    "substitution of eq .   into the boundary conditions and ,",
    "yield the following set of @xmath2 simultaneous equations to determine the quasi - momenta as functions of @xmath9 @xmath44 the purpose of this work is to explore solutions of these equations to reveal key features of the system such as the excitation spectrum of the gas as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "analytical solutions of eq .   have previously been found for up to three particles  @xcite , however to our knowledge the only numerical calculations have been for the ground state energy  @xcite .",
    "once eqs .",
    "have been solved it is true that , in principle at least , one has obtained all neccessary information to obtain the wave function for the system .",
    "however in practice , even for a modest number of particles such as ten , the wave function itself will involve a summation over @xmath45 terms , a somewhat cumbersome object .",
    "however , for certain physical quantities , simple analytical expressions involving only the quasi - momenta can easily be derived , for instance the energy of the @xmath16th eigenstate is given by @xmath46 and likewise the total momentum by @xmath47 we will utilise equation in section [ exc_spect ] to obtain the excitation spectrum .",
    "the behaviour of the bose gas with attractive interactions has received far less scrutiny than its repulsive counterpart .",
    "originally lieb and liniger did not consider this regime to be of physical relevance  @xcite , however mcguire showed  @xcite that once an @xmath2-particle bound state had formed , the ground state energy of the system scales as @xmath48 this posed problems for the solution in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 constant .",
    "in contrast for the repulsive case it is found @xmath52 , and hence an expression for the energy density could be found  @xcite .",
    "however @xmath53 diverges in the attractive regime .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that the limit of an extremely dilute gas is free from these divergences , provided one took the limit as @xmath54 constant .",
    "another possibility is to consider the limit @xmath50 while @xmath2 remains constant  @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned the quantum phase transition to a soliton - like state provides added interest for the attractive gas .",
    "this transition spontaneously breaks the translational symmetry of the system even at zero temperature .",
    "we discuss this point further in section [ quasi ] and see how the eigenstates obtained from the bethe ansatz maintain the translational symmetry of the hamiltonian by forming a continuous superposition of localised states around the ring .",
    "we have included in appendix [ meanfieldc0 ] a simple derivation ( following the work of kavoulakis  @xcite ) of the critical interaction strength ( @xmath55 ) at which the phase transition is predicted to occur .      [ quasisect ]    to find the quasi - momenta @xmath56 that fully characterise the exact solution , we must numerically solve eqs .  .",
    "for @xmath2 particles this gives @xmath2 simultaneous nonlinear equations .",
    "the nature of most root - finding algorithms is such that it requires a reasonable initial guess for the location of the roots .",
    "we have developed a suitable procedure to solve these equations for a range of interaction strengths @xmath9 starting from the known solutions for the ground and excited states at @xmath43 , which are given by all @xmath57 being an integer .    to find the solution for non - zero @xmath9 ,",
    "we first choose a value for @xmath9 close to zero , and use the ideal gas solution for the state we are interested in as the initial guess for the root - finding algorithm .",
    "we make use of the built - in root - finder ` fsolve ` in the software package matlab on a standard desktop pc . by choosing a small enough @xmath9",
    "the initial guess for the quasi - momenta are close to the actual solution , and the root - finding algorithm converges relatively rapidly .",
    "once the first solution close to @xmath43 is found , @xmath9 is decreased in small increments @xmath58 and an initial guess for the quasi - momenta for the new value of @xmath9 is based on a smooth extrapolation from the previous values . typically the extrapolation is based only on the two previous values of @xmath9 and is thus linear .",
    "difficulties arise in this method when a particular quasi - momenta at an interaction strength @xmath9 differs greatly from that at @xmath59 .",
    "this problem arises particularly when @xmath9 is close to the critical interaction strength @xmath60 and we discuss how we deal with the problem later",
    ".    the actual size of @xmath58 will be dependent on how large @xmath2 is .",
    "the scaling behaviour of the critical interaction strength goes as @xmath61 and we find that the efficiency of the algorithm is improved by using @xmath58 as small as @xmath62 .",
    "it is possible to use a larger value of @xmath58 but we have found that smaller step sizes give better initial predictions for the roots for the next step and results in faster convergence of the root - finding algorithm .",
    "we have not found it necessary to make use of high precision arithmetic used by sakmann _",
    "@xcite in finding our solutions . in their work",
    "they make use of a particular transformation [ see eq .",
    "( 33 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] popularised in the seminal work of lieb and liniger  @xcite .",
    "the transformation simplifies the numerics in the repulsive case by _ spreading _ the transformed quasi - momenta into numbers which can be easily distinguished by machine precision .",
    "the same is not true in the case of attractive interactions . as pointed out by sakmann _",
    "et al . _ , working with the transformed quasi - momenta in the attractive case requires numerical precision of approximately @xmath63 . in this work",
    "we solve eqs .   directly .",
    "we set the tolerance of the ` fsolve ` algorithm to iterate until eqs .",
    "are solved such that the left hand side equals the right hand side to an absolute accuracy of @xmath64 .",
    "once the value of @xmath65 has been increase to be point that the quasi - momenta are within @xmath64 of the string solution the algorithm terminates .",
    "we present the results of these calculations in two different ways .",
    "figures [ sixpartkatt ] , [ attractive_limit1 ] , and [ attractive_limit2 ] show the continuous evolution of the real and imaginary parts of the quasi - momenta , for a number of excited states as @xmath9 becomes more negative .",
    "figure  [ sixpartkatt ] shows eight excited states for @xmath66 , whereas figs .",
    "[ attractive_limit1 ] and [ attractive_limit2 ] show two representative excited states for @xmath1 .",
    "figures [ comp1 ] , and [ comp2 ] show snapshots of the distribution of the quasimomenta in the complex plane for @xmath1 .",
    "our calculations elucidate the _ deviations _ from the string solutions at finite density  @xcite .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ sixpartkatt](b ) and ( e ) that as the real parts of @xmath57 and @xmath67 become equal the imaginary parts _ bifurcate _ , and vice - versa .",
    "these splittings of the quasi - momenta provide additional challenges for the root - finding algorithm . because the splitting often occurs sharply , the initial guess for the quasi - momenta found from the previous value of @xmath9 can be sufficiently inaccurate that the algorithm does not converge . thus if one finds that the root - finding algorithm is not converging at a particular value of @xmath9 then this could be an indication that two equal quasi - momenta are beginning to split .",
    "when this occurs there is always a degeneracy between the quasi - momenta as to which one _ goes up _ and which one _ goes down _ ( this degeneracy is of no _ physical _ consequence , it is merely a mathematical hurdle ) .",
    "the numerical fluctuations of the values of the quasi - momenta is usually somewhere close to machine precision , @xmath68 , and are difficult to detect . in order to observe the splitting we found it was necessary to manually alter the initial guess for the quasi - momenta at these points , forcing one to _ go up _ and one to _ go down _ ( again see fig .",

    "the two solutions are in good agreement above the critical interaction strength , validating the essential properties of the _ bound states _ described in references @xcite .",

    "with @xmath69 the inset shows where the quasi - momenta _ bifurcate _ for this case.,width=264 ]            there is no fundamental limit to the excited states we can reach with this procedure , and similar graphs can be produced for up to approximately @xmath1 particles ( see fig .  [ attractive_limit1 ] and [ attractive_limit2 ] as examples of the @xmath1 particle gas ) . in principle",
    "this work could be extended to larger numbers of particles , and in fact we have found the ground state for up to @xmath70 . however , the _ bifurcations _ in the excited states require some time to locate and we have had to deal with them manually .",
    "this means that the algorithm begins to take a considerable amount of time for @xmath2 significantly larger than twenty .",
    "roots of eq .   for @xmath10 have a far more complicated behaviour than in the more commonly studied repulsive regime .",
    "apart from the obvious reason that the quasi - momenta can be complex ( as opposed to strictly real for the repulsive gas  @xcite ) , there also exists the change in behaviour at the critical interaction strength @xmath71 . for some time",
    "it has been suspected that the roots for large enough attraction would take values on _ strings _ in the complex plane which correspond to some bound state of the system  @xcite .",
    "that is , the wave function would represent some kind of localised state  @xcite such as @xmath72 and the corresponding quasi - momenta of this state would be @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the total momentum of the state .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that although we refer to the wave function in eq .   as a _ localised state _",
    "it is not localised to any specific point .",
    "rather it has a localised pair correlation  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) are bosonic field operators which annihilate ( create ) a particle at position @xmath78 .",
    "thus measurements of the density of an ensemble will always yield a localised projection , whilst the system is not localised _",
    "prior _ to the measurement .",
    "one can think of the system prior to the measurement as being in a ( macroscopic ) superposition of localisation at _ every _ point on the ring .",
    "this form for the quasi - momenta given by eqs .",
    "is commonly referred to in the literature as a _ string _",
    "solution  @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that multiple strings may exist for one system ( @xcite and references therein ) , with each string corresponding to a soliton of different momentum .",
    "this choice of quasi - momenta also seems intuitively reasonable and gives the result , mandated by mcguire  @xcite for the total energy of the bound state @xmath79 the degree to which the system is localised by these string solutions can be quantified by the absolute values of the imaginary parts of the quasi - momenta .",
    "thus , in eqs .",
    ", as @xmath65 increases , so does the degree of localisation ( as one would naively expect ) .",
    "however , it is easy to show that in the ideal limit , @xmath80 , the quasi - momenta are exactly the single particle momentum states . thus if one accepts the quasi - momenta given by eqs .",
    ", then one is left with chronic discontinuities in the behaviour of the quasi - momenta as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "our results give direct evidence that the two limits are bridged via eqs .  .",
    "we also find other families of excited states , with multiple bound states forming in the limit of strong attraction . these show agreement with the truncated diagonalization results discussed later in section [ comparison ] .",
    "these families of excited states can be interpreted as the formation of multiple bound states .",
    "it is very interesting to observe this intermediate behaviour between the ideal gas and strongly attractive gas since this is where soliton formation occurs at zero temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ sixpartkatt ] we see the behaviour of the quasi - momenta for a system of @xmath66 particles in the eight lowest energy states ordered via their energies at @xmath43 . as @xmath65 becomes larger , energy level crossings are observed as in fig .",
    "[ sixpartbetheatt ] .",
    "the quasi - momenta begin at @xmath43 at their respective single particle momentum states , and as @xmath9 becomes more negative the quasi - momenta tend toward a string solution as predicted .",
    "the initial behaviour of the imaginary part of the quasi - momenta goes like @xmath81 for @xmath82 , but for @xmath83 when the system is in a localised state the low - lying eigenstates have quasi - momenta corresponding to the string solutions eqs .  .",
    "this is verified again for the @xmath1 particle gas in fig .",
    "[ attractive_limit1 ] where the solid blue lines show the quasi - momenta as a function of @xmath84 and the red dashed lines show the string solution eqs .  , and",
    "both are in agreement in the strongly attractive limit .",
    "however , we also find excited states that do not agree with eqs .  , but instead form multiple bound states .",
    "this results in a decrease in the degree of localisation . in these cases",
    "we find the behaviour of the quasi - momenta at large @xmath65 to be given by @xmath85 we interpret this solution physically as an @xmath86 particle bound state with momentum @xmath87 and an @xmath88 particle bound state with momentum @xmath89 .",
    "evidence of these states can be seen in fig .",
    "[ attractive_limit2 ] where the solid blue lines show the quasi - momenta as a function of @xmath84 , whereas the red dashed lines show the solutions given by eqs .   with @xmath69 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "the behaviour is perhaps clearer in figs .",
    "[ comp1](c ) and [ comp2](c ) where one can see the two distinct strings in the complex plane .",
    "one can derive a simple expression for the energy of these states ( similar to eq .  ) , @xmath92 this trend continues such that three or more bound states of atoms occur within the system .",
    "the evidence for this is most easily seen by the grouping of the quasi - momenta in the complex plane [ figs .",
    "[ comp1](c ) and [ comp2](c ) ] .",
