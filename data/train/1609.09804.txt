    "<S> this new phase manifests itself in quantum interference and therefore has implications for the scattering of many particles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the outcome of scattering events of more than two particles is determined not only by pairwise distinguishabilities of the particles wavefunctions , but also on the collective properties of the particles . in this context </S>",

    "<S> it shows having truly indistinguishable particles is a crucial ingredient for all types of scattering experiments . </S>",
