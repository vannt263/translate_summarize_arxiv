    "tidal torques act to establish synchronization between the spin of the non - degenerate companion star and the orbital motion .",
    "whenever the spin angular velocity of the donor is perturbed ( by a magnetic stellar wind ; or change in its moment of inertia due to either expansion or mass loss in response to rlo ) the tidal spin - orbit coupling will result in a change in the orbital angular momentum leading to orbital shrinkage or expansion .",
    "+ we have performed detailed numerical calculations of the non - conservative evolution of @xmath0 close binary systems with @xmath1 donor stars and a @xmath2 accreting neutron star . rather than using analytical expressions for simple polytropes",
    ", we calculated the thermal response of the donor star to mass loss , using an updated version of eggleton s numerical computer code , in order to determine the stability and follow the evolution of the mass transfer .",
    "we refer to tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) for a more detailed description of the computer code and the binary interactions considered .",
    "consider a circular yr , cf .",
    "verbunt & phinney ( 1995 ) . ] binary with an ( accreting ) neutron star and a companion ( donor ) star with mass @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the orbital angular momentum is given by : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the orbital angular velocity .",
    "a simple logarithmic differentiation of this equation yields the rate of change in orbital separation : @xmath8 where the total change in orbital angular momentum can be expressed as : @xmath9 the first term on the right side of this equation governs the loss of @xmath10 due to gravitational wave radiation ( landau & lifshitz 1958 ) .",
    "the second term arises due to a combination a magnetic wind of the ( low - mass ) companion star and a tidal synchronization ( locking ) of the orbit .",
    "this mechanism of exchanging orbital into spin angular momentum is referred to as magnetic braking ( see e.g. verbunt & zwaan 1981 ; rappaport et al . 1983 ) .      the third term in eq.(2 )",
    "was recently discussed by tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) and describes possible exchange of angular momentum between the orbit and the donor star due to its expansion or mass loss ( note , we have neglected the tidal effects on the gas stream and the accretion disk ) . for both this term and the magnetic braking term we estimate whether or not the tidal torque is sufficiently strong to keep the donor star synchronized with the orbit .",
    "we estimate the tidal torque due to the interaction between the tidally induced flow and the convective motions in the stellar envelope by means of the simple mixing - length model for turbulent viscosity @xmath11 , where the mixing - length parameter @xmath12 is adopted to be 2 or 3 , @xmath13 is the local pressure scaleheight , and @xmath14 the local characteristic convective velocity .",
    "the rate of tidal energy dissipation can be expressed as ( terquem  et  al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath15 \\ , dr\\ ] ] where the integration is over the convective envelope and @xmath16 is the orbital angular velocity , i.e. we neglect effects of stellar rotation .",
    "the radial and horizontal tidal displacements are approximated here by the values for the adiabatic equilibrium tide : @xmath17 where for the dominant quadrupole tide ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 .",
    "+ the locally dissipated tidal energy is taken into account as an extra energy source in the standard energy balance equation of the star , while the corresponding tidal torque follows as : @xmath20 .",
    "+ the thus calculated tidal angular momentum exchange @xmath21 between the donor star and the orbit during an evolutionary timestep @xmath22 is taken into account in the angular momentum balance of the system .",
    "if the so calculated angular momentum exchange is larger than the amount required to keep the donor star synchronous with the orbital motion of the compact star we adopt a smaller tidal angular momentum exchange ( and corresponding tidal dissipation rate ) that keeps the donor star exactly synchronous .      the last term in eq.(2 ) is the most dominant contribution and is caused by loss of mass from the system ( see e.g. van  den  heuvel 1994 ; soberman et al .",
    "we have adopted the `` isotropic re - emission '' model in which all of the matter flows over , in a conservative way , from the donor star to an accretion disk in the vicinity of the neutron star , and then a fraction , @xmath23 of this material is ejected isotropically from the system with the specific orbital angular momentum of the neutron star . if the mass - transfer rate exceeds the eddington accretion limit for the neutron star @xmath24 . in our calculations we assumed",
    "@xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 yr@xmath27 .",
    "assuming @xmath28 and @xmath29 one obtains easily analytical solutions to eq.(1 ) .    in fig .  1 we have plotted @xmath30 as a function of the mass ratio @xmath31",
    "the sign of this quantity is important since it tells whether the orbit expands or contracts in response to mass transfer ( note @xmath32 ) .",
    "we notice that the orbit always expands when @xmath33 and it always decreases when @xmath34 [ solving @xmath35 for @xmath36 yields @xmath37 . if @xmath24 the orbit can still expand for @xmath38 .",
    "note , @xmath39 at @xmath40 independent of @xmath23 .",
    "in fig .  2 we have plotted the orbital evolution of an x - ray binary .",
    "the solid lines show the evolution including tidal spin - orbit interactions and the dashed lines show the calculations without these interactions . in all cases",
    "the orbit will always decrease initially as a result of the large initial mass ratio ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "but when the tidal interactions are included the effect of pumping angular momentum into the orbit ( at the expense of spin angular momentum ) is clearly seen .",
    "the tidal locking of the orbit acts to convert spin angular momentum into orbital angular momentum causing the orbit to widen ( or shrink less ) in response to mass transfer / loss .",
    "the related so - called pratt & strittmatter ( 1976 ) mechanism has previously been discussed in the literature ( e.g. savonije 1978 ) . including spin - orbit interactions many binaries will survive an evolution which may otherwise end up in an unstable common envelope and spiral - in phase .",
    "an example of this is seen in fig .  2 where the binary with initial @xmath42 days ( solid line ) only survives as a result of the spin - orbit couplings .",
    "the dashed line terminating at @xmath43 indicates the onset of a run - away mass - transfer process ( @xmath44 yr@xmath27 ) and formation of a common envelope and possible collapse of the neutron star into a black hole .",
    "in fact , many of the systems with @xmath45 recently studied by tauris , van  den  heuvel & savonije ( 2000 ) would not have survived the extreme mass - transfer phase if the spin - orbit couplings had been neglected .    the location of the minimum orbital separations in fig .",
    "2 are marked by arrows in the case of @xmath46 days .",
    "since the mass - transfer rates in such an intermediate - mass x - ray binary are shown to be highly super - eddington ( tauris , van  den  heuvel & savonije 2000 ) we have @xmath47 .",
    "hence in the case of neglecting the tidal interactions ( dashed line ) we expect to find the minimum separation when @xmath48 ( cf . section  3 ) .",
    "since the neutron star at this stage only has accreted @xmath49 we find that the minimum orbital separation is reached when @xmath50 . including tidal interactions ( solid line ) results in an earlier spiral - out in the evolution and the orbit",
    "is seen to widen when @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .      for low - mass ( @xmath53 ) donor stars",
    "there are two important consequences of the spin - orbit interactions which result in a reduction of the orbital separation : magnetic braking and expansion of the ( sub)giant companion star . in the latter case",
    "the conversion of orbital angular momentum into spin angular momentum is a caused by a reduced rotation rate of the donor .",
    "however , in evolved stars there is a significant wind mass loss ( reimers 1975 ) which will cause the orbit to widen and hence there is a competition between this effect and the tidal spin - orbit interactions for determining the orbital evolution prior to the rlo - phase .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "+ we assumed @xmath54 where the mass , radius and luminosity are in solar units and @xmath55 is the mass - loss parameter .",
    "it is seen that only for binaries with @xmath56 days will the wind mass loss be efficient enough to widen the orbit . for shorter periods the effects of the spin - orbit interactions dominate ( caused by expansion of the donor ) and loss of orbital angular momentum causes the orbit to shrink .",
    "this result is very important e.g. for population synthesis studies of the formation of millisecond pulsars , since @xmath57 in some cases will decrease significantly prior to rlo . as an example",
    "a system with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 days will only have @xmath61 days at the onset of the rlo .",
