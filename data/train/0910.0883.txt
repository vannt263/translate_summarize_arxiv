    "x - ray isophotes of massive , rotating elliptical galaxies convey valuable information about the rotation of the hot , virialized interstellar gas , the interaction of this gas with gas recently ejected from evolving stars , and the sense of radial motion  in or out  of the hot gas .",
    "these issues are relevant to understanding the physical nature of the hot gas in galaxy groups and clusters in which gas loses energy by radiating x - rays but does not appear to cool to low temperatures as expected .",
    "in traditional cooling flows the radiating gas approximately maintains the local virial temperature as it flows slowly toward the center of the confining gravitational potential , then cools catastrophically near the center .",
    "the so - called cooling flow problem arises because there is insufficient spectroscopic evidence for cooling gas , previously cooled gas or recently formed stars .",
    "this paradox is apparent in massive galaxy clusters , galaxy groups and individual elliptical galaxies , i.e. the cooling flow problem is independent of scale . for this reason observations of x - ray luminous ,",
    "relatively nearby elliptical galaxies can provide important clues to unravel the mysteries of cooling flows that do not seem to cool .",
    "the recent deep 81ks chandra observation of the nearby x - ray luminous elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 by humphrey et al .",
    "( 2008 ) led to the detection of a massive central black hole ( @xmath3 @xmath1 ) .",
    "this supermassive black hole was found for the first time directly from x - ray data by assuming that the hot gas is very nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the increased quality of the x - ray observations of ngc 4649 has motivated us to develop a dynamical model for the hot gas flow in this rotating galaxy .    at any time the radial flow of hot gas",
    "must either be inward , outward , a combination of the two , or stationary .",
    "many people think that cooling inflows can not occur in elliptical galaxies or elsewhere because of the absence of x - ray spectral emission at low and intermediate temperatures ( e.g. xu et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we showed for galactic - scale cooling flows that dust expelled from stars can cool the gas so fast that very little low - temperature thermal x - ray emission occurs ( mathews & brighenti 2003a ) .",
    "nevertheless , cooling inflows can not dominate over time since the central mass accumulated would greatly exceed limits set by the velocity dispersion of central stars .",
    "detailed gasdynamical models with _ ad hoc _ heating sources have shown that the transition from cooling inflows to strong low - density wind outflows is very abrupt ( mathews & brighenti 2003b ) . in the absence of extreme fine tuning , most of the x - ray luminous hot gas bound to elliptical galaxies can not be flowing globally outward , although inhomogeneous outflowing regions of lower gas density ( and x - ray emissivity ) in jets or buoyant regions are not ruled out .",
    "if the gas is not flowing at all , continued enrichment by type ia supernovae for a few gyrs will raise the iron abundance to several times that of the underlying stars , which is not generally observed ( e.g. humphrey & buote 2006 ) .",
    "one way to avoid this enrichment catastrophe is to recognize that some or most of the snia iron may cool radiatively in a way that can not be observed , as discussed by brighenti & mathews ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , the modest snia enrichment observed in the hot gas can be understood if much of the hot galactic gas flows radially inward , and the abundance can be even further reduced if more extended circumgalactic group - scale gas with relatively low metallicity flows inward past the sources of stellar enrichment .",
    "circumgalactic gas is likely since humphrey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derive a group - level virial mass for ngc 4649 , @xmath4 @xmath1 .",
    "several additional observations of ngc 4649 can be understood most easily in terms of gaseous inflow .",
    "first , the central gas temperature peak discovered by humphrey et al .",
    "( 2008 ) within a few 100 parsecs was predicted by cooling _",
    "inflow _ models as gas approaches a massive central black hole ( brighenti & mathews 1999 ) .",
    "while only a central gas pressure peak is sufficient to determine the black hole mass , a peak in the gas temperature is a signature of compressional heating as hot gas flows inward toward a strongly concentrated mass or small rotating disk . this compressive heating can occur even when the gas is losing energy by standard radiative losses .",
    "additional support for subsonic compressional heating during inflow follows from the observation that the entropy of hot gas closest to the black hole is lower than in any other region in ngc 4649 so it has not been recently heated by the central agn .",
    "another important signature of subsonically inflowing gas seen in ngc 4649 and other similar elliptical galaxies is a central flattening of x - ray isophotes on kpc scales .",
    "elliptical x - ray isophotes on galactic scales have different implications than on larger scales which have been used to infer flattening of the dark halo potential ( buote et al .",
    "isophotal flattening in excess of that required by the underlying stellar potential can be interpreted as a spinning up of hot inflowing gas expected when angular momentum is exchanged with gas recently ejected from old , mass - losing red giant stars that participate in the galactic rotation .",
    "we review below the recent compilation of chandra isophotes of elliptical galaxies by diehl & statler ( 2007 ) and show that they generally resemble ngc 4649 in central flattening and implied inflow spin - up .",
    "ngc 4649 is an ideal candidate galaxy to study the influence of rotation on the x - ray isophotes because of its remarkably high rotation rate for a massive , cored e galaxy , its proximity , and our good fortune to have received at least one moderately deep chandra observation .    in the following discussion",
    "we review the implications of recent chandra images of ngc 4649 and present gasdynamical models of increasing complexity .",
    "unlike our previous studies of rotating cooling flows ( brighenti & mathews 1996 , 2000 ) , we include the important contribution of inflowing and non - rotating circumgalactic gas from a group - scale halo .",
    "in addition , since the central x - ray isophotal flattening observed in ngc 4649 and other massive ellipticals is less than that expected from the conservation of angular momentum , we invoke an _ ad hoc _ hot gas turbulence that can transport angular momentum away from the galactic spin axis . by combining turbulence and circumgalactic inflow",
    "it is easy to explain the isophotal flattening observed in ngc 4649 .",
    "moreover , the turbulent viscosity that is consistent with the x - ray isophotes of ngc 4649 generates a turbulent pressure that is much less than the gas pressure .",
    "therefore , the subsonic turbulent activity required to reduce the angular momentum does not significantly degrade the total mass determinations of humphrey et al .",
    "( 2008 ) based on assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we assume that the mild turbulence we require is produced by energy released near the central black hole or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "our treatment here is done under the assumption that most of the _ observed _ x - ray emission in ngc 4649 can be explained with inflowing gas .",
    "we do not propose that this is the complete solution to the gas flow problem in this or other similar galaxies , but only demonstrate that the x - ray observations are consistent with an _ apparent _ global inflow at the present time . to avoid unobserved catastrophic radiative cooling and a huge mass concentration in the galactic core , we must also assume that there is a ( possibly buoyant ) return mass outflow that is too intermittent , too hot , or too cunningly disguised to contribute to chandra observations ( mathews & brighenti 2004 ; brighenti & mathews 2006 ) .",
    "ngc 4649 ( m 60 ) is a luminous , e1/e2 elliptical galaxy with boxy , cored stellar isophotes .",
    "much is known about this well - observed galaxy because of its high luminosity and proximity ( 15.6 mpc : tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) . unlike other luminous group - centered elliptical galaxies , ngc 4649 has an unusually large galactic rotation , increasing along the major axis to about 110 km s@xmath2 at 3.8 kpc .",
    "because of its large line of sight rotation , we shall generally assume for simplicity that ngc 4649 is viewed nearly perpendicular to its axis of rotation .",
    "like many massive elliptical galaxies , ngc 4649 has a pair of low power radio jets each extending out 3 kpc from the galactic nucleus ( stanger & warwick 1986 ; shurkin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure 1 shows the major axis rotation curve @xmath5 of ngc 4649 measured by de bruyne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and pinkney et al .",
    "the upper solid curve in figure 1 shows the local circular velocity @xmath6 based on the combined mass of black hole , stars , and dark halo determined by humphrey et al .",
    "also plotted in figure 1 as rising dotted lines are trajectories of gas that conserve the same specific angular momentum @xmath7 as that of the local stars at four observed radii .",
    "for example if all the hot gas at 3.8 kpc ( @xmath8 ) were rotating with the stars , as this gas flows inward it would spin up and collapse into a rotationally supported disk at @xmath9 kpc where the rising dotted line intersects @xmath6 .",
    "such a large disk , which would be extremely obvious in the x - ray images of ngc 4649 , has not formed ( although smaller disks are possible ) .",
    "this rotational cooling flow catastrophe could be cited as an argument that the hot interstellar gas in elliptical galaxies can not be flowing inward , but such a conclusion is unwarranted without further examination .",
    "figure 2 shows the apparent radial variation of the isophotal x - ray ellipticity @xmath10 of ngc 4649 observed with chandra by diehl & statler ( 2007 ) and more deeply by humphrey",
    ". some of the observational uncertainty within about 0.5 kpc of the galactic center may be due to difficulties in identifying and removing bright point sources and to the larger pixel size relative to the elliptical image near the galactic center .",
    "however , the two sets of x - ray observations in this small central region are consistent within observational uncertainties and those of humphrey are in good agreement with optical ellipticities . over the radial range @xmath11 kpc , @xmath12 increases monotonically with decreasing galactic ( major axis ) radius .",
    "we interpret this important feature of @xmath10 in ngc 4649 as a ( somewhat diluted ) spin - up flattening expected from the naive inflow argument in figure 1 .",
    "it is significant that the radial variation of @xmath12 in figure 2 beyond about 1 kpc is opposite to that of the ellipticity of the stellar image @xmath13 based on @xmath14-band observations of peletier et al .",
    "indeed , in the small region @xmath15 kpc ( @xmath16 log r @xmath17 ) it is likely that @xmath12 is larger than @xmath13 , i.e. the hot gas is flatter than the local starlight , a feature seen in many massive elliptical galaxies ( diehl & statler 2007 ) .",
    "such a trend arises naturally if the hot gas flows inward and is spun up to rotate faster than the local stars . in an oblate stellar ellipsoid having a highly concentrated de vaucouleurs - type profile the gravitational potential is always more spherical than the local stellar density contours because the potential contributed by the dense central core acts much like a point mass .",
    "the starlight in ngc 4649 is flattened only slightly by galactic rotation , i.e. @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    to explore further this argument for inflowing gas",
    "we consider a variety of alternative possibilities .",
    "first consider non - radiating hot gas that does not flow inward .",
    "if ngc 4649 is assumed to have an axisymmetric oblate geometry , the x - ray ellipticity @xmath12 of non - rotating , non - radiating hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in its slightly flattened stellar distribution must be less than about half that of the local stars @xmath13 if the stellar density is constant with radius and indeed is typically very much less due to its strong central density concentration ( cf . figure 2 - 13 . of binney & tremaine 1987 ) . if slowly rotating but non - radiating hot gas in such a galaxy has a virial temperature and specific angular momentum similar to that of the stars , @xmath12 will increase above the non - rotating case but certainly can not exceed @xmath13  i.e. as a firm upper limit the gas can not rotate faster than the stars from which it was ejected . finally , if the hot virialized gas is allowed to radiate and flow inward , its rotation velocity and @xmath12 will increase even further until at a small enough radius @xmath12 may exceed @xmath13 .",
    "this is the type of inflow spin - up that we observe in ngc 4649 where @xmath19 is seen in a limited region in figure 2 . in the presence of inflowing , low - angular momentum gas from the circumgalactic halo region , as we expect in ngc 4649 , @xmath19 is even more difficult to achieve without inflow spin - up . in  9",
    "we review evidence for inflow spin - up in other nearby x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "the rotational cooling inflow catastrophe toward large disk formation in ngc 4649 ( as in fig .",
    "1 ) can be mitigated by the influence of extended circumgalactic gas and interstellar turbulence . in view of its origin by cosmic accretion ,",
    "the virialized hot gas in the extended group - scale gaseous halo around ngc 4649 probably has little or no global rotation .",
    "consequently , the specific angular momentum of gas ejected from red giants rotating with the galaxy will be reduced as it mixes with gas of lower angular momentum flowing in from the halo . mixing inflowing halo gas with stellar ejecta",
    "not only avoids forming large x - ray disks that are not observed , but also maintains the gas phase iron abundance close to that observed .",
    "in addition , it is well known that turbulent viscosity in the hot gas can spread angular momentum away from the axis of rotation , also reducing the likelihood of large disk formation .",
    "turbulence can be driven by the intermittent release of agn energy associated with a small accretion onto the central black hole as evidenced for example by the radio jets observed in ngc 4649 . when circumgalactic inflow and turbulence are combined , it is possible to flatten the x - ray isophotes by an amount consistent with observation .",
    "the gasdynamical equations that we use to describe rotating , non - turbulent gas flow in ngc 4649 are identical to those discussed in brighenti & mathews ( 2002 ) and mathews & brighenti ( 2003b ) : @xmath20 @xmath21 = - { \\bf \\nabla } p - \\rho { \\bf \\nabla}\\phi - \\alpha \\rho _ * ( { \\bf u } - { \\bf u}_*),\\ ] ] and @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the specific thermal energy . the specific rate that mass is lost from an old stellar population of initial mass @xmath24 is approximated with @xmath25 s@xmath2 where @xmath26 gyrs ( mathews 1989 ) .",
    "we assume that all of the gas ejected from evolving red giants eventually merges with the hot gas and c and n abundances in the hot gas provide evidence that this assumption is reasonable ( werner et al .",
    "gas at temperature @xmath27 and abundance @xmath28 loses thermal energy at a rate @xmath29 erg @xmath30 s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt the cooling coefficient of sutherland and dopita ( 1993 ) , @xmath31 erg @xmath30 s@xmath2 , where in equation 3 @xmath32\\lambda_{sd}$ ] and @xmath33 is the molecular weight .    as discussed above",
    ", gas can not simply flow into the core of ngc 4649 and accumulate there over most of the hubble time , because the total mass in and near the central black hole would be much larger than observed .",
    "centrally inflowing gas must therefore flow out from the core in a manner consistent with the observed x - ray image , which , as we show here , resembles a cooling inflow .",
    "since we do not treat the mass outflow in this paper , inflowing gas in our calculations does in fact cool in the central grid zone or onto a disk in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "we consider two different ways of treating the inner boundary condition where gas cools : ( 1 ) allow cooled gas in central or disk zones to remain there at some low temperature ( we choose @xmath35 k ) and be supported by internal pressure or rotation , or ( 2 ) remove cold gas from these zones as it begins to cool , allowing only hot gas to appear on the grid . to implement this second approach",
    "we include a mass sink term in the continuity equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the local radiative cooling time at constant pressure .",
    "furthermore , the dimensionless coefficient @xmath38 is chosen to depend very sensitively on gas temperature so that gas is only removed when its temperature drops below about @xmath39 k , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 k. except for the central zones , this gas removal scheme has no effect on the flow where @xmath43 .",

    "the stellar temperature @xmath50 can be found by solving the jeans equation , but this term is small and it is sufficient to use the approximation , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the local observed stellar velocity dispersion in the galaxy .",
    "heating by type ia supernovae , each of energy @xmath53 ergs , is assumed to be smoothly distributed in the hot gas and is described by multiplying the characteristic temperature of the mass @xmath54 ejected , @xmath55 , by the specific mass loss rate from supernovae , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the assumed @xmath58-band stellar mass to light ratio .",

    "turbulent viscosity is essential to interpret the observed variation of x - ray isophotal ellipticity in ngc 4649 .",
    "since the rotational component of the gas velocity is typically much greater than that in the meridional plane , we consider only the viscous transport of the azimuthal gas velocity component @xmath71 .",
    "our treatment of the viscous modification of the angular momentum density @xmath72 follows the same prescription as described in detail in brighenti & mathews ( 2000 ) to which the reader is referred .",

    "the problem we address is somewhat ill - posed because of ( 1 ) unavoidable multi - gyr transients and ( 2 ) the intrinsic time variability of important parameters .",
    "regarding the first point , suppose ( as we usually do ) that the initial hot gas galactic atmosphere has the observed radial gas density and temperature profiles but is at rest with no rotation .",
    "as rotation is induced by stellar mass loss ( from the term @xmath82 in eq .",
    "2 ) the interstellar gas spins up and an inward flow develops because of radiative losses .",
    "these transient adjustments can take many gyrs . consequently",
    ", we have decided to ( rather arbitrarily ) select 6 gyrs as a time to view all models . as we describe below",
    ", a few flows have nearly reached a steady state by this time while others may still be slowly evolving .",
    "secondly , the stellar mass loss rate and supernova rate are expected to change with time as the galactic stellar population evolves .",

    "the observed gas density is fit nicely beyond about 1 kpc in these flows , but continues to rise above the observed density inside this radius .",
    "this is a standard shortcoming of all simple one - dimensional cooling flows as discussed in detail by mathews & brighenti ( 2003b ) .",
    "the central and right panels in figure 3 show the results of identical one - dimensional calculations performed with coarser grid resolutions , @xmath105 and 600 pc .",

    "to verify that a rotational cooling flow catastrophe could in fact occur in ngc 4649 , we begin our two dimensional calculations with a non - turbulent flow in which galactic stars are the only source of hot gas , i.e. we do not include group - scale gas at any radius .",
    "the computed flow after 6 gyrs is shown in the left panels of figure 4 .",
    "since stellar mass loss and supernova rates are held constant , as discussed above , this solution reaches a steady state after only @xmath1112 gyrs and remains essentially unchanged afterwards .",
    "gas ejected from stars is heated to the galactic virial temperature by gravitational compression and by the source terms in equation 3 .",
    "the top left panel in figure 4 shows that the computed ( and azimuthally averaged ) gas density ( solid line ) is much less than that observed by humphrey et al .",
    "( filled circles ) and this discrepancy increases with galactic radius beyond 10 kpc .",
    "this density shortfall arises because the stellar mass loss rate is unable to replenish gas at the same rate that it cools by radiative losses and flows into the cooling disk near the galactic core .",
    "the computed gas temperature is also much cooler than the observations because the local virial temperature associated with the stars @xmath112 is less than that in the surrounding dark halo .",
    "the lower left panel in figure 4 shows an image of the computed flow viewed in bolometric x - ray emission . the intense x - ray emission that results as gas cools toward the rotationally supported disk of radius @xmath113 kpc dominates the entire x - ray appearance of the galaxy .",
    "these computed x - ray isophotes have little resemblance to those observed in ngc 4649 ( dashed lines ) or observations of any other known elliptical galaxy .",

    "finally , in the right panels of figure 6 we explore the effect of a turbulent viscosity that exceeds that of the reference model , i.e. @xmath114 km s@xmath2 and @xmath115 .",
    "the x - ray isophotes are seen to be considerably rounder for this flow and are a reasonable match to the observations beyond about 0.5 kpc from the center . however , for this solution the flow approaches that of a non - rotating pure cooling flow with density that is too high ( for @xmath142 kpc ) and with a temperature gradient that remains positive in the range @xmath125 kpc .",

    "the bolometric x - ray image is essentially indistinguishable from the reference flow in figure 6 .",
    "it is important to note that our flows at high resolution do not oscillate unrealistically near the center as mass is removed by cooling .",

    "the snake - like flow in the central few kpc is characteristic of all our solutions and also occurs in flows that are not rotating .",

    "these velocities have spatial scales that are similar to those observed in optical emission lines in luminous elliptical galaxies ( caon , machetto & pastoriza 2000 ) , but the observed velocities are somewhat higher .",

    "this near equality could arise if viscous damping increases more strongly toward the center than in our computed flows , allowing a nearly spherical flow of gas onto the central black hole in ngc 4649 .",
    "the crosses in figure 1 show the tangential gas velocity along the major ( @xmath28 ) axis for the high resolution flow in figure 8 . because of inflow spin - up , the gas rotates faster than the stars for @xmath161 kpc .",
    "in their recent analysis of chandra x - ray images observed in 54 elliptical galaxies diehl & statler ( 2007 ) found no convincing correlations between the x - ray appearance and the rotation of the galactic stars or the shape of the stellar potential . specifically , they found no clear relationship between the mean x - ray ellipticity and line of sight stellar rotational velocity , both averaged over 0.6 - 0.9@xmath162 where @xmath162 is the j - band effective radius of the galactic stars .",
    "furthermore , their plots of the x - ray ellipticity @xmath163 against either the stellar ellipticity @xmath164 or the stellar rotation @xmath165 show large scatter without an obvious correlation .",
    "( they do not consider the effective potential of the x - ray gas in its locally rotating frame . )",
    "these results led diehl & statler to conclude that the hot gas in elliptical galaxies is quite far from hydrostatic equilibrium and that rotation can not be the dominant factor that produces the hot gas x - ray ellipticities they observe .",
    "however , we suspect that conclusions based on x - ray ellipticities and stellar properties , when spatially averaged over the broad radial range 0.6 - 0.9@xmath162 , may be insensitive to regular trends in the x - ray and stellar ellipticity profiles apparent in the unaveraged , raw data ( fig . 5 of diehl & statler 2007 ) .",
    "for example , for ngc 4649 diehl & statler find that the x - ray ellipticity @xmath166 is less than the corresponding stellar ellipticity @xmath167 , and , for similar galaxies in their complete sample , diehl & statler infer that the hot gas is not rotating or is insensitive to the flattened stellar potential in this annular bin . however , we interpret the negative slope @xmath168 in ngc 4649 ( fig .",
    "2 ) beyond about 0.5 kpc ( @xmath169 ) as clear evidence of rotational spin - up resulting from a global inflow of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "rotational spin - up of the hot interstellar gas can not be accurately inferred from absolute values of ellipticity or the line of sight velocity at any particular radius . instead , in the mitigating presence of turbulence and/or circumgalactic gas , rotational spin - up",
    "can only be detected by the radial trend of x - ray isophotal flattening , @xmath170 , particularly when @xmath158 near the center of the galaxy , implying that the gas is rotating faster than the local stars .    to explore our interpretation further ,",
    "we examine the detailed chandra data of @xmath10 and @xmath171 for 36 well - observed galaxies in figure 5 of diehl & statler ( 2007 ) . we do not consider six of these galaxies ( ngc 193 , 383 , 507 , 1316 , 1553 , and 4526 ) since their morphological classification parameter @xmath27 from leda exceeds -4.0 , suggesting that they are e / s0 or later , although our conclusions are independent of this sample refinement . with this reduced sample of 30 e galaxies , we subjectively classified the innermost slope @xmath168 into positive ( + ) , indeterminate ( 0 ) and negative ( - ) .",
    "we find the number of galaxies in each slope category to be ( + , 0,- ) = ( 4,10,16 ) , showing that a majority of chandra - observed e galaxies have negative @xmath168 as expected from inflow spin - up .",
    "however , some of these galaxies have been observed at only 1 - 3 radii within @xmath162 either because of their large distance and reduced spatial scale or because of the relatively low total number of chandra photons available . to allow for this ,",
    "we consider a smaller subsample of 16 e galaxies , including ngc 4649 , in which @xmath12 has been measured at four or more radii @xmath172 .",
    "for this well - observed subsample we find overwhelming evidence for rotational spin - up in @xmath173 : ( + , 0,- ) = ( 2,2,12 ) .",
    "those few galaxies with indeterminate or positive @xmath168 may have spin axes that are closer to our line of sight or their ordered rotation may have been masked by transient kinematical activity following a recent agn outburst ",
    "such asymmetric agn disturbances in elliptical galaxies have been studied and quantified in detail by diehl & statler ( 2008a ) .",
    "in addition , for the 12 e galaxies showing clear evidence of inflow spin - up , @xmath170 , the stellar and x - ray ( major axis ) position angles are in good agreement either near the galaxy center or closer to @xmath162 where most of the stellar mass loss and angular momentum may be deposited . finally , of the 12 galaxies with strong evidence of inflowing rotational spin - up ( @xmath170 ) , the innermost measured x - ray ellipticity in 10 galaxies exceeds the ellipticity of local stars .",
    "since the stellar gravitational potential in giant elliptical galaxies is always more spherical than the local ellipsoidal stellar density distribution , this ellipticity excess can not be understood as non - rotating gas nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium in the flattened stellar potential or gas rotating with the local stars .",
    "instead , @xmath158 indicates that the inner hot gas in these 12 galaxies is rotating faster than the local stars , as a natural consequence of inflowing spin - up .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of any clear correlations among broadly binned averages , @xmath163 and @xmath164 or @xmath163 and @xmath165 , as found by diehl & statler ( 2007 ) in their complete sample , is interesting and should be better understood .",
    "we believe that several factors combine to explain the scatter in these plots .",
    "the mass of inflowing circumgalactic , group - scale gas increases with the mass of the surrounding dark halo which is highly variable among optically similar elliptical galaxies ( mathews et al . 2006b ) . as a result",
    ", the fractional contribution of inflowing ( non - rotating ) circumgalactic gas in the hot gas near the galactic effective radius is expected to vary considerably . for a given rotation of the stellar system , the x - ray ellipticity should decrease inversely with the local fraction of circumgalactic gas .",
    "this introduces a stochastic variation in @xmath163 that is unrelated to inflow spin - up .",
    "secondly , we have shown here that the x - ray ellipticity and its radial variation depends somewhat on large scale subsonic velocity fields in the hot gas .",
    "these velocities are weakly time - dependent and may depend on the radial distribution ( and age ) of mass - losing stars which may vary among the galaxies in the sample considered by diehl & statler .",
    "finally , the unknown turbulent viscosity profile in the hot gas may alter @xmath10 in complicated and unpredictable ways because of occasional energy outbursts associated with agn feedback from the central black hole . during the period of transient recovery following each agn outburst , the systematic spatial and kinematic patterns in the hot gas are likely to be significantly disturbed .",

    "this latter removal could be simply a continuation of the circumgalactic cooling inflow but ultimately this metal - rich gas must cool or be transported far out into the hot gas in jets or buoyant regions . in principle , the iron from type ia supernovae may cool by radiative losses before it thermally merges with the hot gas ; the main difficulty with this is the uncertain thermal conductivity imposed by the unknown local magnetic field topology ( brighenti & mathews 2005 ) .    0.1 in ( 5 ) _ gas density and inflowing circumgalactic gas _ : for galaxies like ngc 4649 the expected stellar mass loss rate from an old stellar population is insufficient to maintain the relatively high gas densities observed in the presence of inflow ( e.g. fig .",

    "the currently preferred paradigm for solving the cooling flow problem , as explained in detail in the recent review by mcnamara & nulsen ( 2007 ) , is that the hot gas is being heated by the creation of x - ray cavities or by the dissipation of outwardly propagating shock waves . according to this hypothesis , as the hot gas is heated in this manner , it experiences little or no systematic flow in either radial direction . but",
    "neither of these heating mechanisms seems likely in ngc 4649 .",

    "however , the effect of inflow spin - up on the x - ray isophotes observed in ngc 4649 and other similar galaxies is clearly inconsistent with non - cooling flow models that stop the inflow with heating at every radius .",
    "finally , we note again that the hot gas observed within the central elliptical galaxy must move radially to avoid extremely large iron abundances , assuming that type ia iron thermally merges into the hot gas  this is another difficult constraint when the cooling flow problem is solved with simple heating scenarios in which there is no radial flow of gas .",
    "most of the gas that cools in our computed flows ( with circumgalactic gas ) can not have simply contributed to the mass of the central black hole in ngc 4649 since its mass would be reached after only @xmath182 gyrs .",
    "it is also unclear how much cooling is occurring since rapid dust - assisted cooling ( mathews & brighenti 2003a ) would make cooling in elliptical galaxies difficult to detect in x - ray spectra . certainly , the low apparent cooling rate in ngc 4649 estimated from uv line emission , @xmath183 @xmath1 yr@xmath2 , can not be reconciled with the larger mass inflow rates in the models we compute here .",
    "since the x - ray evidence for global inflow is so compelling in ngc 4649 , the most likely fate of the inflowing gas is that gas is being transported outward in a manner that is intermittent or not easily visible in x - ray images and spectra ( mathews , brighenti & buote 2004 ) .",
    "outward mass transport may occur either in jets ( brighenti & mathews 2006 ) or in low density , buoyant outflows created for example with cosmic rays ( mathews & brighenti 2008 ) .",
    "like many massive elliptical galaxies , ngc 4649 has a pair of low luminosity fri radio jets .",
    "these jets may transport thermal gas from deep within the core of ngc 4649 , provided they are similar to the mass - carrying radio jets found in seyfert galaxies by whittle & wilson ( 2004 ) .",
    "some of the cooled gas and dust may also be intermittently removed from deep within ngc 4649 by jets or buoyant outflows as implied by far - ir dust emission observed out to 5 - 10 kpc in many elliptical galaxies ( temi , brighenti & mathews 2007 ) .",
    "it is likely that the mass outflow in ngc 4649 is episodic and that we are viewing ngc 4649 at a quiescent moment between radio lobe outflow events when gas is undergoing a cooling inflow toward the center ( e.g. diehl & statler 2008b ) .",
    "we have shown that the x - ray emitting gas associated with the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 has density and temperature profiles that can be understood as a rotating , radiatively cooling inflow with a mild turbulent viscosity .",
    "evidence of inflow is present at every radius in ngc 4649 . on the largest scales , a radiatively cooling inflow of circumgalactic gas",
    "is required to dilute the hot gas iron abundance acquired from supernovae down to observed values , assuming that the iron ejected by type ia supernovae does not cool by radiative losses before it merges with the ambient hot gas . the relatively high gas density and temperature observed in ngc 4649 beyond @xmath11110 kpc",
    "can also be explained with inflowing circumgalactic gas . on intermediate galactic scales , observations of the x - ray ellipticity in ngc 4649 and",
    "other bright elliptical galaxies show that the hot gas is spun up by mass ejected from evolving stars that rotate collectively with the galaxy .",
    "inflow spin - up is seen in the increasing x - ray isophotal ellipticity with decreasing galactic radius until it exceeds the ellipticity of the local stars near the galactic center .",
    "however , for ngc 4649 , which rotates unusually fast for a massive boxy elliptical , a small turbulent viscosity is required to avoid forming multi - kpc x - ray disks that are not observed .",
    "the shallow negative temperature gradient inside @xmath0 kpc in ngc 4649 is x - ray evidence of an inflow that compresses toward a sub - kpc disk .",
    "the observed x - ray isophotes can be matched with a turbulent viscosity for which the corresponding turbulent pressure is much less than the gas pressure , so the integrated mass profiles found by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( humphrey et al . 2008 ) are unaffected .",
    "this alleviates the concern expressed by diehl & statler ( 2007 ) that the hot gas in elliptical galaxies is very far from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "galactic mass determinations based on x - ray thermal emission may fail for some elliptical galaxies where non - thermal pressure dominates the galactic core , such as ngc 4636 ( brighenti & mathews 1997 ; baldi et al .",
    "2009 ) , but this problem does not seem to occur in ngc 4649 . on the smallest scales observed with chandra , within about 100 parsecs , the central temperature peak in ngc 4649 discovered by humphrey et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is a natural consequence of subsonic cooling inflow . in spite of ongoing radiative losses , the central gas temperature increases due to ( nearly adiabatic ) compression as gas approaches the central black hole or the small disk around it .",
    "the kpc - scale negative temperature gradient in ngc 4649 formed as gas compresses toward a small disk is not caused by recent agn heating since the gas entropy in this region increases with galactic radius .",
    "this type of central inflow is also consistent with nuclear disks of cooled dusty gas having radii of a few hundred parsecs commonly observed in the cores of luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "ngc 4649 represents the most concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem .",
    "the observed density and temperature profiles can be explained at every radius with a radiatively cooling inflow . at the smallest observable radius in ngc 4649 ,",
    "about 150 pc , the times for cooling and flow to the core are only a few million years . for this reason it will be very difficult to devise heating scenarios that maintain the gas at rest , perfectly mimicking a cooling inflow .",
    "no ideally heated model in which the hot gas in ngc 4649 remains stationary can account for commonly observed x - ray ellipticity profiles @xmath10 that require inflow spin - up .",
    "the current mass inflow rate in our successful calculations is @xmath0 @xmath1 yr@xmath2 , but the stellar mass loss rate was certainly several times larger in the past .",
    "consequently , if this flow continued over a hubble time , the total mass of cooled gas accumulated in the galactic core of ngc 4649 would exceed the mass of the black hole and stars within @xmath0 kpc by factors of 3 - 10 .",
    "therefore , the mass inflow indicated by the central temperature peak must be removed from within @xmath151 pc at a ( time - averaged ) rate comparable to @xmath0 @xmath1 yr@xmath2 and transported out to a large radius without interfering with the x - ray appearance of ngc 4649 which resembles a traditional cooling flow .",
    "this mass outflow may occur in the bipolar jets observed in ngc 4649 and many other bright ellipticals .",
    "alternatively , nuclear hot gas may become buoyant by intermittent local heating or by cosmic rays and flow out subsonically upstream in the cooling flow ( e.g. mathews & brighenti 2008 ) .",
    "if the buoyant gas density is only slightly less than that of the ambient gas , it may not significantly disturb the radial gas density and temperature profiles set by the inflowing gas .",
    "alternatively , if the density of buoyant ( or jet ) gas were considerably lower , its x - ray emission would be less easily observed against the brighter emission from denser inflowing gas .                                                                                                    3.in   in ngc 4649 ( _ solid line _ ) with major axis stellar rotation @xmath185 ( _ dashed line _ ) from pinkney et al .",
