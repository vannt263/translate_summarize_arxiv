    "the observed accelerated expansion of the late - time universe , as evidenced by a number of cosmological data like type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite ( cmb ) and large scale structure @xcite ( lss ) came as a great surprise to cosmologists .",
    "it is quite straightforward to explain the effect within the framework of friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology by simply introducing a cosmological constant or a more general ( dynamical ) dark energy component .",
    "however , all such components give rise to severe coincidence and fine - tuning problems .",
    "an alternative approach postulates that general relativity is only accurate on small scales and modifications at larger scales are needed .",
    "these modification would lead to the observed late - time acceleration @xcite .",
    "recently , several works have tried to take a different approach , namely to study the effect of large scale structure on the observed luminosity - to - redshift behavior of snia ( the first observable that has led to the conclusion that the universe is accelerating ) .",
    "the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known to be violated at late times .",
    "however , the scale at which the assumption breaks down is still in debate , @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , recent studies have been able to reproduce the luminosity - to - redshift relation provided that we live in a large region , called empty void , in which the matter density is less than the spatial average density on large cosmological scales ( @xcite , for a recent review see @xcite )",
    ". however , also these models are still in debate since they require the observer to be located at the center of the void or at most within about few percent of the void scale radius @xcite , thus disfavoring the model from a copernican principle ( cp ) point of view .    despite all the theoretical efforts to understand",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe , see @xcite , right now there is no model capable of providing singlehandedly a satisfactory explanation .",
    "an alternative is to create null tests for the current paradigm and see if and how it breaks down .",
    "for example , clarkson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a new test for the cp which relies on a consistency relation that exists within the homogenous and isotropic flrw model between the luminosity and the hubble parameter .",
    "this relation is expected to hold exactly at all redshifts @xmath3 , and any deviation will point to a departure from the flrw model . indeed , to be precise , the test of clarkson _ et al .",
    "_ tests deviations from a flrw metric and not strictly from the cp , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the existence of this consistency relation implies that if we have two separate experiments measuring independently the comoving distance @xmath1 ( or equivalently the angular diameter distance or the luminosity distance ) and the hubble parameter @xmath0 , then we are able to reconstruct the curvature parameter @xmath4 at each redshift in a model - independent way . in a flrw universe ,",
    "the curvature parameter should not depend on redshift , hence @xmath4 should not vary , so if we measure a variation of the curvature parameter over redshift , this means that the assumption of homogeneity at large scales has to be rejected .",
    "since it was proposed , this test has raised interest in the astrophysics community .",
    "@xcite have applied it by using available data ; ref .",
    "@xcite has discussed the deviation from the flrw relation due to backreaction ; refs . @xcite",
    "have predicted the outcome of the test , i.e. the behavior of @xmath5 with redshift , in the case of their particular inhomogeneous cosmology or void model ; ref .",
    "@xcite has made predictions on future results from the test if a toy - model of backreaction is assumed to be the correct cosmology ; ref .",
    "@xcite has used it to measure the curvature of the universe in a model - independent way .",
    "also , many other tests of the standard model of cosmology have been outlined ( for most recent work , see @xcite , and for a review see @xcite )    in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite has used @xmath0 data from passively evolving galaxies @xcite and the snia of @xcite and has found no indication of a deviation from flrw . ref .",
    "@xcite has used snia data of @xcite , h(z ) data from passively evolving galaxies @xcite and baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data @xcite , and the @xmath6 measurement of @xcite .",
    "similarly , ref .",
    "@xcite has used the snia of @xcite and the measurement of @xmath6 of @xcite or of @xcite , in combination with @xmath0 measurements coming either from passively evolving galaxies @xcite , or from bao data @xcite , together with cosmic microwave background data @xcite .",
    "no evidence for deviations from flrw nor from flatness was found .    in this context",
    ", our work has two objectives , building on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first objective is to improve the measurement of @xmath5 by comparing four different measurement techniques based both on binnings of the data and on very efficient model - independent reconstructions of functions , and by using the most recent data .",
    "the second is to make new up - to - date forecasts for the @xmath5 test for future lss and snia data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] we describe the general background equations used for our analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : reconstruction_h_d ] we describe four different methods to reconstruct the hubble parameter and the comoving distance from two different data sets . in particular we show : the data binning and direct error propagation method , the principal component analysis ( pca ) , the genetical algorithms ( ga ) and the pad approximation . in each subsection",
    "we report the results .",
    "[ sec : forecasts ] is devoted to the fisher matrix forecasts on the errors for the @xmath4 at different @xmath3 using the euclid galaxy redshift survey @xcite and future snia surveys .",
    "here we review the basic equations and notation for the background evolution .",
    "the evolution of the dark energy can be expressed by the present dark energy density @xmath7 and by a time - varying equation of state : w(z)= [ eq : parameterofstate ] . where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pressure and energy density of dark energy , respectively .",
    "the dark energy density equation is @xmath10 and ( z)=_0^zdz .",
    "[ eq : densit ] the hubble parameter @xmath0 and the angular diameter distance @xmath11 , in a flat universe with @xmath12 , are h^2(z)=h_0 ^ 2[_m(1+z)^3+(1-_m)(1+z)^3(1 + ) ] [ eq : hubbleparam ] and d_a(z)=_0^z .",
    "[ eq : flatangdist ] in a general flrw model with curvature , the angular diameter distance can be written as : d_a(z)=(_0^zdz ) .",
    "[ eq : curvangdist ] where @xmath4 is the curvature parameter today .",

    "( [ eq : curvangdist ] ) to obtain an expression for the curvature parameter @xmath4 that depends on the hubble parameter @xmath0 and comoving distance @xmath13 , see @xcite :",
    "_ k(z)= , [ eq : omegak ] where the comma refers to the derivative with respect to the redshift .",
    "the above equation tells us how we can measure the curvature parameter in a model - independent way from hubble rate and distance measurements .",
    "if we live in a flrw universe , then the curvature parameter is independent of redshift , i.e. @xmath14 should be a constant @xmath15 ; however , if we measure a variation of the curvature parameter , this would indicate that the homogeneity of the large - scale universe is violated .    in order to test the values of @xmath4 at different redshifts",
    "we need to combine two independent measurements : that of the hubble parameter @xmath0 and that of the comoving distance @xmath1",
    ". in the next section we will use the hubble parameter data set from @xcite and the snia magnitude data - set from the scp `` union2.1 '' @xcite to reconstruct the curvature parameter as a function of redshift .",
    "in this section we present four different ways to reconstruct the curvature parameter using measurements of the hubble parameter and comoving distance from snia .",
    "first , we briefly describe the data sets that we will use in the present analysis .",
    "these are :    * the hubble parameter data that directly probe @xmath0 , in the most recent compilation given by moresco et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors implemented a _",
    "differential approach _ to evaluate the hubble parameter ; first they chose from different catalogs early - type galaxies and then they selected only the most massive , red elliptical galaxies which are passively evolving and do not manifest any signature of ongoing star formation .",
    "the hubble parameter is then given by h(z ) = - where @xmath16 is simply given by the difference in redshift of two galaxies and @xmath17 is given by their differential dating of star populations .",
    "* the snia data that probe the luminosity distance @xmath18 , where @xmath1 is the comoving distance .",
    "in particular , we use the `` union2.1 '' set of 580 snia of suzuki et al . @xcite .",
    "the data are given in terms of the distance modulus ( z ) & & m(z)-m=5 _",
    "10(d_l(z))+25 + & = & 5 _ 10(h_0 d_l(z))+_0 , [ eq : dist - mod ] where @xmath19 is the apparent magnitude at peak brightness , @xmath20 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath21 with @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the chi - square is then ^2_snia=_i=1 ^ 580()^2 . for simplicity we only consider the case where the covariance matrix of the snia data is diagonal .",
    "the first technique to measure @xmath2 consists in evaluating it in several redshift bins by directly computing the comoving distance @xmath1 and its derivative @xmath23 from the snia data and by using the @xmath0 values measured from passively evolving galaxies data . to compute @xmath1 , we simply invert eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist - mod ] ) that expresses the distance modulus @xmath24 as a function of @xmath1 : d(z ) = . [ eq : com - dist ] the resulting comoving distances computed from the `` union2.1 '' snia",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comoving - distances ] .    ) . ]",
    "the obtained data are then divided into bins .",
    "we do this in two different ways , in order to understand which way produces the best results , and to control the dependence on the specific binning .      in the first approach",
    ", we aim at maximising the number of bins . since the number @xmath25 of @xmath0 data is quite small",
    ", we choose a number of bins as close as possible to @xmath26 .",
    "to do so , we use the following procedure .",
    "we split the redshift interval @xmath27 between each pair of @xmath0 data , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , into two equal parts .",
    "we take @xmath30 as the initial redshift of the first bin . since the snia s",
    "highest redshift is @xmath31 , the last bin does not contain any snia , and we discard it .",
    "this means that we also have to discard the last two @xmath0 data points .",
    "the resulting bins are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : bins1 ] .",
    ".properties of bins described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bins1 ] and values of the comoving distance @xmath32 , derivative of the comoving distance @xmath23 and curvature parameter @xmath5 measured in each bin . with @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "we indicate the left and right edge of each bin , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 refers to the redshift to which the mean distance @xmath32 has been assigned , while @xmath36 is the mean redshift of the bin .",
    "[ tab : bins1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         we notice that using euclid data alone , the redshift region where errors are smallest is @xmath37 . at lower and at higher redshifts constraints become worse by up to a factor of two and a half . adding the first set of @xmath38 snia does not change results substantially at low redshift , while it does improve constraints at redshifts @xmath39 .",
    "the second set of snia with @xmath40 instead improves constraints at all redshifts by a factor of @xmath41 and it moves the best constrained area to @xmath42 . in this case , one will have to worry about modeling the snia systematic errors , but this goes beyond the scope of our paper and is left to future work .",
    "for comparison , we also plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : errors - euclid - sn ] the curve representing the behavior of the curvature parameter for the timescape scenario of @xcite , for the tardis cosmology of @xcite , and for the ltb model given by @xcite",
    ". the euclid survey will not be able to rule out the latter class of models , not even when adding snia constraints , as these models are asymptotically flat homogeneous models . only surveys that observe galaxies at low redshifts , with @xmath43 , will be able to rule out ( or confirm ) these models since they all manifest , at these redshifts , a very different behavior from the flat flrw model , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : errors - euclid - sn ] .",
    "however , if a model has a value of @xmath5 of about @xmath44 , we may be able to distinguish it from flat flrw with euclid future data .",
    "in this paper we used four different methods to reconstruct , in a model - independent fashion , the hubble parameter and the luminosity distance , measured by two different data sets .",
    "we find that all four methods used , i.e. direct binning , principal component , genetic algorithms and pad approximation , give results that are in agreement with respect to their general behavior .",
    "in particular , all four methods lead to very large errors at low redshifts , while errors decrease noticeably for larger @xmath3 .",
    "the transition redshift is in all cases between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to be specific , as for the direct binning and the pca techniques , the best measured @xmath5 have errors @xmath47 . for the genetic algorithms and pad approximations instead , we found that the errors on the curvature parameter are of the order of about @xmath48 at small redshifts , and they decrease when @xmath3 grows , reaching a value of about @xmath49 for redshifts @xmath50 .",
    "this means that reconstruction techniques manage to reduce the error if compared to techniques where data need to be binned .",
    "the best method , leading to the smallest error on @xmath5 , @xmath51 , is the one based on ga .",
    "we also find that the choice of the binning , as expected , influences the values of the errors , by affecting mostly the derivative of the comoving distance .",
    "this is simply due to the nature of the snia data : in regions where the values of the distance modulus have large fluctuations , there will be a strong dependence of the choice of binning on the value of the derivative .",
    "going back to the problem of the large size of the errors at low redshifts , this may appear strange because here we have a large number of data with small errors ( in particular as regards snia data , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : comoving - distances ] ) .",
    "if we have a closer look though , we find that the main reason for this feature lays on the expression of @xmath5 itself , so let us explain this in detail . the curvature parameter was found to be _",
    "[ eq : omegak - concl ] this expression tells us that if the universe is not homogeneous then the curvature parameter has to vary with redshift , i.e. @xmath5 is not constant . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : curvangdist ] ) we learn that the comoving distance is the integral of the hubble parameter ; however , eq .  ( [ eq : curvangdist ] ) has been evaluated under the assumption of homogeneity , as a consequence @xmath5 can only be constant .",
    "now let us assume that , via one observable , we measure the hubble parameter @xmath0 and , via another independent observable , we measure the luminosity distance , which gives a slightly different hubble parameter , say @xmath52 . then , substituting @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : curvangdist ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegak - concl ] ) will look like : _",
    "k(z ) = _ k , [ eq : omegak - lowz ] where @xmath53 is the function that we want to evaluate , whereas @xmath5 is the standard curvature parameter . as we can see , for small redshifts , the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegak - lowz ] ) stays finite ( @xmath54 ) , but the denominator does not ( @xmath55 ) . let us assume that for @xmath56 , the quantity @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a small number that goes to zero when @xmath59 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : omegak - lowz ] ) reads _",
    "k(z ) = _ k= _ k [ eq : omegak - lowz1 ] for @xmath60 , eq .  ( [ eq : omegak - lowz1 ] ) becomes _ k(z)=_0(_k ) , then , in order for the above equation to stay finite at small redshift we need @xmath52 to be exactly equal to @xmath0 ; in other words , the curvature parameter stays constant at small redshifts if the universe is homogeneous !",
    "this is the reason why for small redshifts , when measuring @xmath0 and @xmath1 with independent observations , the values of the curvature parameter ( and their errors ) are very large . in this paper , we used two different datasets which give , of course , two different best fits of the parameters and consequently these two best fits will give two different hubble parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath52 ) , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegak - lowz1 ] ) still diverges when @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , we can also perform a series expansion on eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegak - concl ] ) for small @xmath3 .",
    "doing so we find _",
    "k=_k+++ ... , where the primes denote a derivative with respect to @xmath3 , eg @xmath61 , while @xmath6 and @xmath62 are the values of the two hubble parameters at @xmath30 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we can also clearly see , in a model - independent way and without assuming a dark energy model , the type of the singularity as @xmath63 .",
    "so , unless @xmath64 then there will be a singularity @xmath65 at @xmath30 .",
    "to also prove numerically what is explained above , we report the case of the pca analysis . here",
    "the value of the hubble parameter in each of the 6 bins , obtained when using the best fits from snia are : @xmath66 . when using the best fits from @xmath0 measurements from passively evolving galaxies , we obtain instead : @xmath67 .",
    "the difference of the hubble parameters in the first redshift bin is @xmath68 ; even though this number is very small , it is not small enough to guarantee the curvature parameter to be stable at low redshifts .",
    "the same conclusion was previously found by @xcite was found ] .",
    "also @xcite explain this feature of the @xmath5 test , but their analysis was done assuming a particular dark energy model and the results could be different for different models . here",
    "we have demonstrated that eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegak - concl ] ) always diverges at small redshifts independently of the model as @xmath65 , for all models different from the homogeneous and isotropic one .    as a last remark ,",
    "it is important to notice that in general the data are not free of systematics ( and they are unavoidable ) , so even if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , we will always reconstruct two different hubble parameters from two different datasets , which will lead to a divergent ( or very large ) @xmath5 at low redshifts",
    ". probably the test of @xmath5 will give a results that it is still consistent with the flrw universe within the errors .",
    "also , one should consider that there will always be a `` noise '' in the measurement of @xmath5 due to the presence of inhomogeneities , that generate fluctuations on the measured values of the pure flrw cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "future data from the euclid satellite will improve considerably the errors on the curvature parameter with respect to present data ; in particular we will have an improvement of about @xmath69 times when using euclid only , and even up to @xmath70 times if we add future snia data to the euclid survey data .",
