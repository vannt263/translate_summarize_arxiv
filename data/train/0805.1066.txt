    "astronomers around the world are making significant efforts to image planets in orbit around other stars beuzit07,nielsen07,lafreniere07,apai08 .",
    "work on suppressing the glare of potential parent stars has proceeded to the point where contrast ratios of @xmath7 can now typically be achieved on the telescope , and @xmath8 is on the horizon macintosh06,dohlen06 . since the contrast ratio for the jupiter / sun is @xmath9 [ a contrast ratio which has now been achieved in a laboratory,][]trauger07 , the majority of this detection work focuses on young stars , as giant planets should be warmest , largest , and brightest when they are young , but will cool , contract , and fade inexorably as they age graboske75,bodenheimer76,saumon96,burrows97 . given the difficulty of these low contrast ratio observations , the interpretation of observed photometry and spectra takes on great importance . in practice , when faint planetary candidates are detected , evolution models , which aim to predict the structural and atmospheric properties with age , are needed to convert observed photometry or spectra into a probable planetary mass .",
    "the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs and giant planets are still not well understood in detail . while brown dwarfs likely form directly from molecular cloud gas in something akin to the star formation mechanism luhman07,whitworth07 , `` true planets '' form in a disk ( iau definitions aside  for a discussion see chabrier et al .",
    "2007 ) , perhaps predominantly via core accretion lissauer07 .",
    "recently , discussion has turned to how these distinct formation mechanisms , which may overlap at several jupiter masses , may leave observational signatures in terms of an object s orbit , evolution , and atmosphere . a given parent star may well harbor both classes of low mass objects .",
    "this paper addresses the atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) , while also describing the spectral properties of our recent work to couple core accretion formation to subsequent planetary evolution marley07 . in this introduction",
    "we will first review giant planet evolution models , then discuss our current understanding of the metal - enhanced atmospheres of jupiter and saturn . in ",
    "2 we describe our model atmosphere code , while in  3 we discuss the differences in atmospheric pressure - temperature ( _ p - t _ ) profiles , chemistry , and spectra between models at solar metallicity and those at 5@xmath10 solar .",
    " 4 focuses in particular on the near and mid infrared colors of metal - enhanced atmospheres while in  5 we discuss and tabulate the near- and mid - ir colors for our `` hot start '' and core - accretion start evolution models .",
    " 6 addresses nonequilibrium chemistry while  7 contains additional discussion , caveats , and our conclusions .      over the past decade",
    "only a small number of workers have attempted the difficult task of coupling non - gray radiative - convective atmosphere models to thermal evolution models to enable an understanding of interior structure , atmospheric structure , atmospheric chemistry , and emitted spectra for giant planets and brown dwarfs [ e.g.,][]burrows97,chabrier00b , baraffe03,saumon08 .",
    "it has perhaps only recently become appreciated by the wider community that these models do not include a mechanism for the formation of the objects that they aim to understand . the starting point for these models",
    "is an arbitrarily large and hot , non - rotating , adiabatic sphere .",
    "these model objects are then allowed to cool and contract from this arbitrary state .",
    "the initial model is soon unimportant , as the cooling and contraction are initially very fast , since the kelvin - helmholtz time , @xmath11 is inversely proportional to both luminosity and radius .",
    "although it is true that the models forget their initial conditions eventually , it is not immediately obvious how long this may take . in the past ,",
    "a common thought was that after `` a few million years '' the initial conditions are forgotten and that these standard `` hot start '' evolution models are reliable .",
    "although this type of model has been successfully applied to jupiter for decades [ e.g.,][]graboske75,hubbard77,guillot95,fh03 their application to planets at very young ages could potentially be suspect stevenson82b .",
    "more recently baraffe02 have investigated similar issues for brown dwarfs .    in order to better understand the properties of gas giant planets at young ages , in marley07 we undertook an investigation of the early evolution of giant planets , with initial properties given by a state - of - the - art model of planet formation by core accretion hubickyj05 , rather than the traditional ( but arbitrary ) initial condition which we termed a `` hot start . '' as shown in , the post - formation properties of these planets are surprising .",
    "the model planets started their lives smaller and colder than their hot start brethren .",
    "the core accretion start models were less luminous by factors of a few to 100 , and the initial conditions were not forgotten for timescales of tens of millions to one billion years .",
    "the reason for the significant difference lies in the treatment of gas accretion [ see][]marley07 . in the hubickyj05 models the accreting gas arrives at nearly free fall velocity to a shock interface at the protoplanet",
    "the shock radiation transfer is not followed directly , but a shock jump condition from stahler80 is employed ; this accretion luminosity is entirely radiated away , leading to the prominent luminosity spike in these models during gas accretion .",
    "the gas that finally accretes onto the planet is therefore relatively cold , low entropy gas .",
    "it is therefore enticing to imagine that one could use the early luminosity , @xmath0 , and surface gravity to determine the formation mechanism of a faint planetary - mass companion .",
    "this may be possible , but we caution that the current generation of core accretion formation models hubickyj05,alibert05,ikoma00 are still only 1d representations of a 3d process",
    ". a detailed look at radiation transfer in the formation shock , as well as incorporating multi - dimensional accretion , should be undertaken before accurate luminosities of young planets can be confidently predicted .",
    "there is , however , another promising avenue for determining `` planethood . ''",
    "while a brown dwarf - like companion and its parent star would be expected to share common elemental abundances , the same may not be true of a companion that formed in a disk via core accretion .",
    "the _ galileo _ and _ cassini _ spacecrafts have unambiguously shown us that the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn , respectively , are enhanced in heavy elements relative to the sun .",
    "the _ galileo entry probe _ measured the abundances of oxygen , carbon , nitrogen , sulfur , and various noble gases in the atmosphere of jupiter . except for oxygen , an enhancement of @xmath122 - 4@xmath10 solar for each element was found atreya03 , although the oxygen abundance determination may have been hindered by meteorological effects showman98 .",
    "saturn s atmosphere is enhanced in carbon by factor of @xmath1210 , from an analysis of _ cassini _ spectra flasar05 , and in phosphorus by a factor of @xmath127 , from _ iso _ spectra degraauw97,visscher05 . if jupiter , saturn , and egps formed through a common mechanism , we can expect egp atmospheres to have high metallicities as well .",
    "how this atmospheric metallicity ( and indeed the _ ratios of specific elements _ ) may be set , as a function of planet mass , orbital distance , disk mass , disk metallicity , etc . , is still open territory .",
    "in particular , the relative importance of processes that have enriched the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn is still unclear .",
    "these potentially include planetesimal bombardment and accumulation during formation owen99,gautier01a , gautier01b , guillot00,alibert05b , erosion of the heavy element core stevenson85,guillot04 , direct accretion of metal - rich disk gas guillot06a , and chemical fractionation within the planet ss77b , lodders04 .",
    "clearly observations of extrasolar giant planet will shed light on giant planet formation .",
    "here we will undertake a first step at exploring how the spectra and colors of uniformly metal - enhanced atmospheres differ from strictly solar composition .    since there is some evidence from both observations",
    "chauvin05 and theory boss01b , kroupa03,ida04 that the `` planetary '' and `` stellar '' formation modes may overlap at several jupiter masses , it will be important to be able to decipher a formation mechanism based on observable properties .",
    "some of this work has progressed on the orbital dynamics of given companions or classes of companions , such as by ribas07 , who found different eccentricity distributions for the radial velocity planets above and below 4 @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , transiting planet mass and radius determinations allow for calculations of bulk planet density , which shed light on the internal abundance of heavy elements guillot06,fortney07a , burrows07,baraffe08 .",
    "a hallmark of jupiter and saturn is that they are enriched in heavy elements compared to the sun , which is known from planet structure models podolak74,saumon04 .",
    "these heavy elements are partitioned between a dense core and an enrichment within the h / he envelope hubbard89,guillot99,saumon04 .",
    "all planets which form in disks around young stars are expected to be enriched in heavy elements due to these disks possessing both abundant gas _ and _ solids pollack96,ida04 .",
    "another rewarding pathway for differentiating planets from low mass brown dwarfs is from direct characterization of their atmospheres .",
    "one could spectroscopically measure the heavy element abundances of the h / he envelope directly , as has long been done in the solar system [ e.g.][]gautier89,encrenaz05 .",
    "if nature is able to form two kinds of objects with an overlapping mass distribution , these distinct formation modes may leave distinct observable atmospheric metallicities in the atmospheres of these objects chabrier07,marley07b .",
    "therefore , two classes of planetary mass companions may be revealed by their emitted spectra .",
    "there are then two tasks to be completed .",
    "we first will investigate the differences in spectra and infrared colors between models of solar composition ( m / h=[0.0 ] ) and those with a metallicity enhanced by a factor of five ( m / h=[0.7 ] ) .",
    "this metallicity enhancement is similar to that of jupiter and saturn , but still far removed from the 30 - 40@xmath10 solar enhancement ( at least in carbon ) that has been measured for uranus and neptune gautier89 .",
    "this investigation will be done at the low gravities and effective temperature most relevant for egps , ( log @xmath14@xmath154.3 , @xmath0@xmath151400 k ) , whereas field t - type brown dwarfs with similar @xmath0s in general have surface gravities 10 times larger .",
    "since we restrict ourselves to @xmath0@xmath161400 k , we will necessarily be targeting cloud - free ch@xmath17-rich , rather than co - rich , atmospheres .",
    "we focus on these relatively cool objects since a detection of ch@xmath17 together with an age estimate would significantly constrain a planetary candidate s mass , even taking into account the uncertainties in evolution models .",
    "later we will examine the evolution of infrared spectra and colors at 5@xmath10 solar metallicity , specifically for the marley07 evolution models for giant planets .",
    "as anticipated , the lower @xmath0  and radii for these models lead to dramatically fainter absolute magnitudes compared to hot start 1@xmath10 solar models .",
    "we employ a 1d model atmosphere code that has been used for a variety of planetary and substellar objects .",
    "recently it has been used for brown dwarfs @xcite and egps @xcite .",
    "the radiative transfer method was developed by @xcite and has in the past been applied to titan mckay89 , uranus mm99 , gliese 229b marley96 , and brown dwarfs in general burrows97 .",
    "we use the elemental abundance data of @xcite and compute chemical equilibrium compositions at metallicities of 1@xmath10 and 5@xmath10 solar , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the chemistry calculations include `` rainout , '' where refractory species are depleted from the atmosphere due to their condensation into cloud decks @xcite .",
    "the spectra of brown dwarfs and our solar system s giant planets can only be reproduced when chemistry calculations incorporate this process fegley94,marley02,burrows02 .",
    "we use the correlated - k method for the tabulation of gaseous opacities @xcite ; our extensive opacity database is described in @xcite .",
    "the model atmosphere code is used to compute radiative - convective equilibrium pressure - temperature ( _ p - t _ ) profiles and low resolution spectra .",
    "high resolution spectra are computed separately using a full line - by - line radiative transfer code , which utilizes the same chemistry and opacity database .",
    "since we are modeling warm planets relatively far from their parent stars , here we ignore stellar insolation .",
    "although we restrict our metal - enhanced planet atmospheres and comparative model spectra to @xmath0@xmath18 k , we have computed 1@xmath10 metallicity models up to 2400 k for use in evolutionary calculations .",
    "this is the grid of model atmospheres that serves as the upper boundary condition for modeling the planets thermal evolution . since cloud opacity",
    "is predicted to affect the evolution of these planets lunine89,chabrier00b , we have elected to include it in the evolution atmosphere grid .",
    "we use the cloud model of am01 to describe the location , vertical distribution , and particle sizes of major cloud - forming species corundum ( al@xmath4o@xmath19 ) , iron ( fe ) , and forsterite ( mg@xmath4sio@xmath17 ) .",
    "we assume an @xmath20 sedimentation efficiency parameter of 2 , which best matches observations of l dwarfs cushing08,marley08 . we have generated a grid of cloudy model atmospheres from log @xmath14=3.0 to 4.5 and @xmath0=500 to 2400 k , supplemented with cloud - free models at @xmath0@xmath16500 k. at low @xmath0 , the refractory clouds reside very deep in the atmosphere and negligibly effect the spectra and structure saumon08 .",
    "a more expansive version of this grid is used in saumon08 to compute the thermal evolution of brown dwarfs down to @xmath0@xmath21500 k. our previous planet evolution calculations , presented by marley07 , neglected cloud opacity .",
    "the inclusion of cloud opacity into the atmosphere grids leads to some differences in the cooling curves from , compared to those from marley07 .",
    "perhaps most notable is that the core - accretion start planets begin their evolution even colder here , because the cloud opacity closes off an atmospheric radiative zone at pressures of several to tens of bars , which has the effect of leaving a cooler photosphere for a given interior adiabat . in general ,",
    "radiative zones can form because the relevant atmospheric opacities , particularly those of water and the pressure - induced opacity of @xmath22 , are strongly wavelength - dependent , and opacity windows can appear around 1 to @xmath23 at temperatures of 1000 to to @xmath24 .",
    "the overlap of the planck function with these windows can allow local radiative transport of energy whereby the temperature profile becomes less steep than an adiabat .",
    "as the local temperature continues to fall and the planck function moves red - ward still , opacities increase again , closing the radiative window and the local temperature profile can again return to an adiabat .",
    "such a two - layered convective structure was predicted for jupiter at pressures of several kilobar and temperatures near 2000 k by guillot94a .",
    "the same effect was subsequently seen in models of brown dwarfs and warm giant planet atmospheres marley96,burrows97,allard01 , but since such objects are warmer than jupiter the corresponding radiative region is higher in the atmosphere at lower pressure originally noted by guillot94a was later found to likely be closed by highly pressure - broadened alkali opacity guillot04,freedman08 .",
    "the potential radiative region in the young giant planet models arises from the longer - wavelength near - infrared windows in water opacity ( @xmath25 ) which are not as strongly affected by alkali opacity . at depth in jupiter",
    "the water opacity windows are closed by the strong pressure - induced opacity of @xmath22 at kilobar pressures . ] .",
    "details of the calculation of the planetary evolution models can be found in marley07 .",
    "all planets are assumed to be composed of pure h / he envelopes , with @xmath26 [ the value used in][]hubickyj05 overlaying a dense olivine core .",
    "the core masses range from 16 @xmath27  ( for the 1 @xmath13  planet ) to 19 @xmath27  ( for the 10 @xmath13  planet ) .",
    "before we generate spectra and colors for these evolutionary models , it is first worthwhile to examine the _",
    "p - t _ conditions for these cool planetary atmospheres . in are shown a collection of cloud - free _ p - t _ profiles at a surface gravity of log @xmath14 ( cgs)=3.67 , representative of a young 4 @xmath13  planet .",
    "solar composition profiles at 1400 , 1000 , 600 k are shown in black , while profiles with 5@xmath10 solar metallicity are shown in red .",
    "solid dots indicate where the local temperature equals the @xmath0 , illustrating the mean photospheric pressure .",
    "chemical boundaries are shown in dashed curves and cloud condensation boundaries are dotted curves , using the same black / red color scheme .",
    "quite clearly , high metallicity atmospheres are everywhere warmer at a given @xmath0 .",
    "the higher gaseous opacity of these atmospheres leads to a photospheric pressure that is necessarily lower at a given @xmath0 ; one can not see as deeply into a higher opacity atmosphere [ e.g.,][]saumon94 .",
    "this difference in pressure is a factor of @xmath122 - 2.5 for these 5@xmath10 solar atmospheres .",
    "this lower photospheric pressure for higher metallicity atmospheres can manifest itself in _ lower _ contributions to the gaseous opacity for some species , specifically those that are pressure dependent .",
    "these include collisional induced absorption ( cia ) by h@xmath4 molecules [ ] [ where the opacity per unit volume is dependent on the square of the pressure]borysow02 , and na and k , which have strongly pressure broadened optical absorption lines bms , allard03 . as has been shown in detail elsewhere [ e.g.,][]lodders02 , condensation and chemical boundaries are non - trivial functions of metallicity .",
    "the higher the metallicity , the higher the temperature at which initial condensation will begin .",
    "however , the co / ch@xmath17 and n@xmath4/nh@xmath19 equal - abundance curves move to cooler temperatures with increased metallicity lodders02 .",
    "the spectra of the profiles plotted in should show strong absorption due to ch@xmath17 and h@xmath4o , with co also appearing in the warmer profiles and nh@xmath19 in the cooler profiles .",
    "spectra for a collection of models are shown in .",
    "the spectra for solar metallicity models are shown in black , while those for the 5@xmath10 solar models are shown in colors .",
    "we can investigate these spectra for diagnostics of high metallicity .",
    "the most prominent difference in spectra between the `` 1@xmath10 '' and `` 5@xmath10 '' models is a flux enhancement in @xmath3 band for all 5@xmath10 models .",
    "this brightened @xmath3 band peak was previously shown for a `` 5@xmath10 '' solar model at @xmath0=1200 k by chabrier07 in their discussion on differentiating planets from brown dwarfs .",
    "this flux enhancement is tied to the cia opacity of h@xmath4 , as it is substantially larger in @xmath3 band compared to other near infrared wavelengths . for lower pressures photospheric pressures",
    "this cia absorption is weaker , letting more flux escape in @xmath3 band , relative to other wavelengths .",
    "also apparent is the increased co absorption at 4.5 @xmath2 m .",
    "however , the greater co absorption at 2.3 @xmath2 m is swamped by the higher @xmath3-band flux . at higher",
    "metallicity the abundances of metal - metal species such as co are increased to a larger degree than those of hydride species .",
    "this leads to stronger co absorption , relative to absorption bands from other molecules .",
    "this 4.5 @xmath2 m co absorption band will likely be a valuable diagnostic for the warmest young jupiters chabrier07 , but its importance necessarily wanes as the co abundance drops dramatically below @xmath0@xmath121000 k for these objects .",
    "absorption band depths due to h@xmath4o and ch@xmath17 are modestly deeper at higher metallicity as well . at the coolest @xmath0s",
    "the bands are so deep that it may well be difficult to see any emitted flux , making band depths a difficult diagnostic in practice",
    ".    the contrast ratios that will be needed to directly image candidate planets are show in .",
    "the flux density at 10 pc is plotted for three models of a 4 @xmath13  planet at an age of @xmath1210 myr .",
    "two models utilize the hot start initial condition ( and allow a comparison of the effects of metallicity only ) while one uses the core accretion initial condition and also has a 5@xmath10 solar atmosphere .",
    "solid curves show the necessary contrast ratios around a sun - like star , while dashed curves are contrast ratios around an m dwarf . strikingly , while the hot start models would be easily detectable at 10@xmath28 contrast in the near infrared , the core - accretion start model would be undetectable . as mentioned above , the h@xmath4o and ch@xmath17 bands are exceedingly dark , especially for the cooler high metallicity planets , such that contrast ratios of @xmath9 may be necessary to see flux from inside these bands",
    ".    allows one to look forward in time to examine these planets at age of 80 myr . by this age",
    "the two different cooling tracks have nearly run together , meaning the core - accretion model has nearly forgotten its initial condition .",
    "although the contrast ratios for all bands in the near infrared are smaller for all the models , compared to 10 myr , one now has the important and distinct advantage that the uncertainties due to the formation history are much smaller .",
    "this will enable a more realistic mass estimate for the planet once one obtains photometric or spectral data .",
    "it is also well known that surface gravity changes photospheric pressures in substellar and planetary objects [ e.g.,][]burrows97,burrows02,kirkpatrick07 . since",
    "a given optical depth is proportional to column density ( as long as cia opacity does not dominate ) , this optical depth is reached at a higher pressure in high gravity objects , meaning they will have high pressure photospheres .",
    "this effect is illustrated in for solar metallicity atmospheres at 1200 and 600 k , at gravities of log @xmath14=3.5 , 4.5 , and 5.5 . whereas old massive brown dwarfs commonly have gravities from 5.0 to 5.5 , young jupiters likely exhibit gravities from 3.5 to 4.0 , meaning they will have warmer atmospheres at a given @xmath0 .",
    "admittedly , plots relative extremes in gravity , but the large differences in photospheric pressures are significant .",
    "as has been shown by other authors [ e.g.,][]burrows03b lower gravity atmospheres must cool to lower @xmath0  values before crossing a given chemical or condensation boundary . while the log @xmath14=5.5 model has clearly passes the water cloud condensation curve at 600 k , the log @xmath14=3.5 model does not .",
    "it is well understood that lower gravity and higher metallicity both lead to lower pressure photospheres . since young jupiter atmospheres couple both higher metallicity and lower surface gravity it may well be that the visible effects of , for instance , the l - to - t transition , disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing , and water cloud condensation may differ in details compared to high gravity brown dwarfs . in  6",
    "we qualitatively address the effects of vertical mixing on carbon chemistry .",
    "differences in particles sizes , opacity , and vertical extent of clouds are possible , even likely .",
    "simple cloud models predict cloud particles sizes than may be @xmath1210 times larger in these low gravity environments @xcite which may lessen the opacity of cloud decks .",
    "while it is still not clear what causes the rapid drop in the opacity of the silicate and iron clouds at the l - to - t transition in brown dwarfs , it should be kept in mind that this transition could be different in character at surface gravities up to 100 times smaller .",
    "for instance , there is already some evidence that the l - to - t transition may occur at lower @xmath0  in low gravity brown dwarfs metchev06,luhman07b , which is reasonable since lower gravity atmospheres trace the _ p - t _ space of higher gravity objects at a lower @xmath0  burrows02,knapp04 .",
    "in we showed spectra of a subset of our 1@xmath10 and 5@xmath10 solar models .",
    "we can further investigate the differences between these models in the commonly used near and mid ir bands .",
    "independent of an evolution model ( since these models are uncertain at young ages ) we can compare the _ differences _ in magnitudes at various values of @xmath0  and log @xmath14 , assuming no difference in radii between 1@xmath10 and 5@xmath10 solar models solar abundance of metals mixed throughout the entire h / he envelope would be modestly smaller .",
    "the effect of a `` solar '' amount of envelope metals on the structure of brown dwarfs is commonly ignored chabrier00,saumon08 . ] . here",
    "we will term the difference in magnitude between the 5@xmath10 and 1@xmath10 solar models the `` metallicity color , '' mc = m@xmath29-m@xmath30 where the letter subscript b is the band and the numerical subscript is the metallicity .",
    "a negative mc means that flux is enhanced in the higher metallicity model .    shows the mc as function of @xmath0  at three values of log @xmath14 that span the gravity values for the models shown in .",
    "although this is an unusual way to plot colors , it allows for a clear determination of the best diagnostics for high metallicity . from 1400",
    "k down to 800 k , @xmath5 colors are @xmath120.7 redder for 5@xmath10 models than for 1@xmath10 models . below 700",
    "k higher metallicity depresses @xmath31 band flux and even more greatly enhances @xmath3 band flux , leading to @xmath6 colors becoming even redder than the @xmath5 colors , with @xmath6 high metallicity models becoming redder by 2.0 - 2.5 than solar composition models , although water cloud condensation below 500 k @xcite could modify this steep falloff .",
    "the @xmath32 band is interesting in that above 800 - 900 k flux is enhanced in @xmath32 at increased metallicity ( see ) but the flux is depressed in @xmath32 for the high metallicity models below @xmath0@xmath12800 k. the remaining bands , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are marginally dimmer in the higher metallicity models , with a flux depression that is monotonically weaker for bands @xmath33 and @xmath34 as gravity increases .",
    "we have coupled our spectral models to our updated marley07 evolution models show in .",
    "this allows for a determination of absolute magnitudes for these model planets as a function of age . in",
    "we provide a table of @xmath0 , radius , as well as absolute magnitudes in the standard red - optical and near infrared filters for the hot start 1@xmath10 models , which include cloud opacity . in",
    "we provide a similar table for the core - accretion start models , assuming cloud - free 5@xmath10 solar metallicity .",
    "this coupling for the core - accretion start models is not strictly self - consistent as the original evolution models used 1@xmath10 atmospheres , but this difference is a small one compared to the uncertainty in the initial condition . since initial @xmath0s are all below @xmath12800 k , the core - accretion start models span a much smaller range of @xmath0  than our own hot start models and those of other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we also limit our calculations to @xmath0  @xmath36 400 k , since we also ignore opacity due to water clouds , which condense around @xmath0=400 - 500 k for these objects marley02,burrows03b .",
    "we note that @xcite have shown that water cloud opacity has a relatively modest effect on the spectra of very cool objects .",
    "we will also address this issue in a forthcoming work on the spectra of ultracool dwarfs and planets below 700 k.    in @xcite and @xcite we showed that evolution models that incorporate a core accretion initial condition are significantly less luminous that our own `` hot start '' models and those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , the luminosity difference for a 4 @xmath13  planet is initially a factor of @xmath12100 at 1 myr .",
    "given this factor of 100 , one would expect a difference in absolute magnitude of five .",
    "this is indeed born out , as is shown in which compares absolute magnitudes for a 4 @xmath13  planet from our hot start 1@xmath10 and core - accretion start 5@xmath10 calculations . as indicated in ,",
    "even by @xmath12100 myr the hot start and core accretion cooling tracks have not yet merged .",
    "this behavior is apparent as well in , which show @xmath120.5 - 1.5 magnitude differences at 100 myr .",
    "another important detection issue is in which bands searches for young jupiters would be most efficiently carried out . from 1400 k down to 500 k , the peak in planetary flux gradually shifts from @xmath32 to @xmath35 as co is lost to ch@xmath17 burrows97 .",
    "the 4 @xmath13  core - accretion planet , which is always relatively cool , is two magnitudes brighter in @xmath35 band than @xmath32 .",
    "however , the @xmath35-band flux will likely be depressed somewhat due to non - equilibrium co / ch@xmath17 chemistry @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have investigated these affects for solar composition models across a wide range of @xmath0 , but at higher gravity than we consider here , and find a @xmath1240% flux decrement in @xmath35 band due to non - equilibrium chemistry .",
    "interestingly , they find that this flux decrement increases with decreasing gravity ( for a given @xmath37 , the eddy diffusion coefficient ) , meaning that non - equilibrium chemistry will likely remain important for young jupiters . indeed , the effects of vertical mixing on ch@xmath17/co mixing ratios were first described in jupiter itself prinn77,yung88,fegley94 .",
    "although planets may well remain brighter in m@xmath38 than l@xmath38 , the lower thermal background in l@xmath38 for ground - based observatories will make both bands attractive for egp searches .",
    "while chemical reaction time constants can be measured ( although there is uncertainly as to the actual reaction pathway for carbon chemistry ) , the mixing time scales are much more uncertain . in the convective atmosphere",
    "the mixing time scale can be computed from mixing length theory . however , in the radiative region , there is no _ a priori _ theory to characterize this mixing , parametrized by @xmath37 .",
    "previous studies in brown dwarfs have varied this coefficient over 6 - 8 orders of magnitude .",
    "parametric studies of the effects of non - equilibrium chemistry in brown dwarfs , as as function of @xmath0 , gravity , and @xmath37 can be found in saumon03 and hubeny07 . in some instances",
    "@xmath37 can be constrained by observations of brown dwarfs [ e.  g.][]saumon06 .",
    "there is also a long history of modeling non - equilibrium chemistry in jupiter , and recent estimates of @xmath37 in jupiter s radiative atmosphere range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 bezard02,moses05 .",
    "there has not yet been a study of non - equilibrium chemistry at the low gravities relevant for young gas giants .",
    "when abundant data for these planets becomes available , detailed studies will of course be necessary .",
    "for now we will treat the effects of nonequilibrium chemistry as an uncertainty in the model spectra , which we can briefly gage .    using the methods described in saumon03,saumon06,saumon07 we have computed models with @xmath41@xmath42 s@xmath43 , for 1@xmath10 and 5@xmath10 solar metallicity , which we show in .",
    "these near - infrared spectra clearly show the effects of enhanced co and depleted ch@xmath17 .",
    "absorption by co in @xmath35 band remains strong down to 500 k , leading to a large flux decrement , especially in the 5@xmath10 solar model . in the @xmath31 , @xmath3 , and @xmath32 bands ,",
    "the reduced ch@xmath17 abundances leads to greater flux ( sometimes dramatically ) escaping through these bands .",
    "the behavior as a function of gravity , metallicity , and @xmath37 is complex due to a number of factors related to the regions of _ p - t _ space that observations are sensitive to .",
    "for instance , lower gravity objects have lower pressure photospheres at a given @xmath0 , while higher atmospheric metallicity pushes the co / ch@xmath17 transition to higher pressure , while higher values of @xmath37 lead to gas being mixed up from higher pressures and higher temperatures .",
    "we caution that these nonequilibrium spectra should only be viewed as illustrative .",
    "the non - equilibrium spectra are computed with the same _ p - t _ structure as the equilibrium models , even though the gas composition and the opacity have changed .",
    "the resulting non - equilibrium spectra have a larger integrated flux than the corresponding equilibrium spectra . in the future we will compute _ p - t _ profiles that are consistent with the nonequilibrium chemical abundances , alleviating this problem [ e.  g.][]hubeny07 .",
    "we have shown how metal enhanced atmospheres differ from their solar composition counterparts , in atmospheric structure , chemistry , spectra , and colors .",
    "we have applied these results to an updated version of the @xcite evolution models , which give cooling tracks for egps that are initially significantly colder than traditional models .",
    "we urge caution in the application of the computed absolute magnitudes for these models provided in . recall that the @xcite models incorporate the formation models of @xcite , which employ a treatment of accretion that is surely much simpler than what occurs in nature . the potential agreement or disagreement between observations and the model cooling tracks and magnitudes",
    "should not be taken as evidence for or against the viability of the core accretion formation scenario . indeed ,",
    "the @xcite prescription is just one of several models of core accretion , which all currently include simplifications of the gas and solid accretion . while we can claim with some confidence that young jupiters are fainter than those predicted from an arbitrarily hot start , how much fainter depends sensitively on the details of accretion marley07 .",
    "given the difficulty of predicting properties of egps at young ages , observations of these young objects will be of central importance .",
    "the next generation of direct imaging platforms will be the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) , likely at gemini south macintosh06 , and spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research ( sphere ) , at the vlt dohlen06 .",
    "the gpi will target the @xmath44 bands , while sphere will focus on @xmath45 .",
    "both instruments will in particular emphasize @xmath31 band .",
    "in we show a four panel plot that illustrates changes to @xmath31-band fluxes due to @xmath0 , gravity , metallicity , and nonequilibrium chemistry .",
    "all are referenced from a standard case model with @xmath0=700 k. since gpi and sphere will likely employ custom narrow - band filters , we have overlain in gray possible narrow filters , kindly provided by j.  graham .",
    "it is clear that the more limited the observations are in wavelength , the more difficult planetary _ characterization _ will be , as lower surface gravity and higher metallicity generally effect spectra in similar ways .",
    "we must also caution that although our understanding of the gaseous opacity in these atmospheres is improving sharp07,freedman08 , calculations of the contribution due to ch@xmath17 are quite uncertain .",
    "the absorption cross - section of ch@xmath17 is difficult to model under the relevant _ p - t _ conditions found here , which manifests itself in mismatches of our models to brown dwarf spectra , especially around @xmath31-band saumon06,saumon07 .      1",
    ".   young jupiter atmospheres will have lower pressure photospheres than old field brown dwarfs due to their lower surface gravity ( which has long been understood ) and higher atmospheric opacity ( if the planets have high atmospheric metallicities , like jupiter and saturn ) .",
    "higher metallicity atmospheres , while generally having more opacity at all wavelengths , have relatively less opacity in @xmath3-band relative to other bands , due to weakened cia h@xmath4 opacity .",
    "this leads to a @xmath3-band flux enhancement of @xmath120.5 to 1.0 magnitudes between @xmath0s of 500 to 1400 k. 3 .",
    "a spectral signature of high metallicity at @xmath0@xmath36 1000 k is a markedly deeper co absorption band at 4.5 @xmath2 m .",
    "a photometric feature of high metallicity at @xmath0@xmath16 1400 k is redder @xmath5 and @xmath6 colors , which may be redder by @xmath120.7 - 1.5 .",
    "we note that points 1 - 3 in particular echo the findings of chabrier07 , who had previously analyzed the spectrum of a representative metal - enhanced planet model within the parameter range we examine here .",
    "the agreement is encouraging .    in closing",
    ", we note that the current best example of how well we may eventually be able to constrain the properties of a young egp comes from the cool t7.5 dwarf gliese 570d .",
    "this brown dwarf is a wide companion to the well - studied k4 v star gl 570a , and to a pair of m dwarfs , gl 570bc .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the distance , metallicity , and age of the system effectively constrain the physical parameters of the t dwarf gl 570d .",
    "the spectrum is extremely well sampled from visible wavelengths , across the near infrared , to the mid infrared with _ spitzer _",
    "irs . saumon06",

    "additionally investigated two late field t dwarfs with similar spectral coverage , but without parent stars to constrain metallicities .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath0  increase @xmath1250 - 100 k , while mass estimates widen to @xmath4830 - 60 @xmath13 . since",
    "young jupiters will have unknown metallicities and early on these objects will sample gravity and metallicity ranges that only marginally overlap the more well understood brown dwarfs , it will be challenging to constrain planetary parameters with limited photometric and spectral data .",
