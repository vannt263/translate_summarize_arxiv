    "non - linear sigma models [ 1 - 3 ] are prototypes of a remarkable class of integrable two dimensional models which contain an infinite number of conserved local and non - local charges [ 4 - 7 ] .",

    "the local charges form an abelian algebra . opposing to that simplicity ,",
    "the algebra of non - local charges is non - abelian and actually non - linear [ 12 - 28 ] .    in ref.[29 ] the @xmath0 sigma model",
    "was investigated and a particular set of non - local charges  called _ improved _ charges  was found to satisfy a cubic algebra related to a yangian structure . in this work",
    "we intend to extend that result to the corresponding supersymmetric case [ 30 - 32 ] .",
    "the introduction of supersymmetry might have rendered a much more involved algebra [ 33 ] .",
    "however , it has been conjectured [ 29,32 ] that , in the sigma model , the algebra of supersymmetric non - local charges would remain the same as in the bosonic theory and we shall present results that confirm such conjecture .    this paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we briefly review the results from the purely bosonic theory .",

    "these charges were named _ improved _ because they brought up an algebraic improvement :",
    "the non - linear part of the algebra is simply cubic , as opposed to the algebra of the standard charges previously used in the literature [ 14 ] .",
    "the jacobi identity and other properties of the improved cubic algebra were thoroughly discussed in ref .",

    ".5truecm we shall define a hermitean generator of improved charges q ( ) i + i_n=0^^n+1 q^(n ) , where @xmath7 will be called the spectral parameter . therefore one can summarize the algebra ( 6 ) as follows :    i\\ { q_ij(),q_kl ( ) } = ( f ( , ) q()- q ( ) ) _ ij , kl , where f(,)e ( q()q()^-1 -^-1 ) = i - _ m , n=0^^m+1^n+1q^(m)q^(n)^-1 -^-1 .",
    "the quadratic non - linearity encoded in @xmath8 can be related to the known yangian structure that underlies this model [ 17 - 26,29 ] .",
    "the advantage in writing the algebra as in ( 8) is not only aesthetic . recalling the monodromy matrix of standard charges , and its algebra expressed in terms of the classical @xmath9-matrix , @xmath10 \\quad , \\\\ & & r(\\lambda , \\mu ) = { i_a\\otimes i_a\\over \\lambda ^{-1}-\\mu ^{-1}}\\quad , \\quad [ i_a , i_b ] = f_{abc}i_c \\quad , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remark that the generator @xmath11 and the @xmath12-matrix play similar rles to those of the monodromy matrix and classical @xmath9-matrix in the standard approach [ 17 - 26 ] .",
    "we do not fully understand the relationship between ( 8) and ( 10 ) but we expect to be able to use this analogy to establish a precise translation between the different sets of charges [ 35 ] . we also hope that a complete knowledge about the conserved charges and their algebra will become an decisive ingredient in off - shell scattering calculations .    .5truecm now let us consider the graphic methods announced in the introduction .",
    "we recall that in ref . [",
    "29 ] the improved charges were constructed by means of an iterative algebraic algorithm that uses @xmath13 as a step - generator , as indicated by the relation ( iq^(n+1 ) ) = linear part of \\{q^(1),q^(n ) } .  after a tedious calculation \" the authors in ref . [",
    "29 ] managed to construct the charges @xmath14 and their algebra up to @xmath15 . in the next section we will present a _ graphic _ method that makes the calculation simpler , less tedious and convenient for a further supersymmetric extension .",

    "therefore we can associate a diagram to each improved charge , as exemplified by the second non - local charge @xmath21 : q^(2)=dx @xmath22    if one is interested in constructing charges , there is an iterative graphic procedure , inspired by the lessons taken from ref .

    "we have tested the efficiency of this method : comparing to the explicit algebraic algorithm in ref . [",
    "29 ] we have taken much less time and space to construct the improved charges . for the sake of clarity we have gathered a few examples in appendix a.    .3truecm we have also developed a diagrammatic technique to calculate the algebra itself .",
    "it can be seen as a set of contraction rules between the chains that constitute the charges .",
    "indeed , in computing the algebra of non - local charges we have to consider all possible  contractions \" ( i.e. dirac brackets ) between symmetrized chains .",
    "after some partial integrations we end up with elementary contractions of the following general kind : s_ia(x)t_bj(x ) \\{(j_)_ab(x),(j_)_cd(y ) } u_kc(y)v_dl(y ) -(i j ) - ( k l ) .",
    "the current algebra ( 3 ) tells us that a contraction @xmath35 may produce a current - like term @xmath36 or a schwinger term .",

    "this was explicitly made in ( 28 ) by means of partial integrations .",
    "within the diagrams this is achieved by inverting some arrows until all of them are pointing towards the chosen semicircle ( i.e. the current component we are isolating ) .",
    "eventually a minus sign will be picked up , depending on the number of inversions .",
    "finally have have this sort of diagrams :    .2truecm    the next step is just a graphic bending of chains , as a preparation to the final contraction . the chains from ( 31 )",
    "should be bended in the following way :    notice that the sub - chains @xmath40 and @xmath41 were transposed as eq .",

    "actually the graphic bending implies the transposition , as exemplified below    where the transposed current components are naturally represented as @xmath42    .5truecm * step 4 : contraction * .2truecm    finally we perform the contraction in ( 32 ) according to the rules below :    where we introduced a symbol corresponding to the @xmath5-product ,    -.6 cm = ( ab)=(ba ) .",

    ".3truecm we mention that the elementary contractions in ( 35 ) are nothing but the graphic representation of the current algebra ( 3 ) , where the diagrams containing the intertwiner field come from schwinger terms followed by partial integrations .",
    "these rules were applied to compute various brackets and in all cases the algebra ( 6 ) was confirmed .",
    "one can also find an example in appendix a.    the most remarkable outcome of this graphic procedure is that it poses an easy and straightforward way to the supersymmetric extension  and possibly other generalizations .",

    ", one can construct non - local conserved charges out of @xmath49 [ 30,31 ] . here",
