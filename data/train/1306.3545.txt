    "light curves of the selected three hard - state periods are magnified .",
    "all the three curves show a rapid decrease when the luminosity decreased below the threshold of @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we call the threshold luminosity starting the rapid decrease `` cut - off luminosity '' . in order to evaluate the cut - off luminosity , we create luminosity dwell - time distributions during the three hard - state periods in figure  3 . in the appendix , the luminosity distributions for typical light - curve profiles are presented .    in the period 4u  1608@xmath052 ( i ) , the luminosity distribution has a peak at @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 ( figure  3a ) , which corresponds to the flux plateau in the hard - high state ( figure  2a ) . in the luminosity below the peak ,",
    "the dwell - time is very small .",
    "this implies that the luminosity decreased rapidly below the hard - high plateau .",
    "therefore , the cut - off luminosity is @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 from the luminosity distribution . in the period 4u  1608@xmath052 ( iii ) ,",
    "rapid luminosity decrease occurred several times at several luminosity levels ( figure  2b ) .",
    "this variation of cut - off luminosity is also seen in the dwell - time distribution in figure  3b , in which the cut - off luminosity is ranging in ( 0.751.0)@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopted the common value for the cut - off luminosity of 4u  1608@xmath052 to be 1.0@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 . in the period aql  x-1 ( ii )",
    ", the rapid luminosity decrease is clearly seen .",
    "the cut - off luminosity is estimated from the lower edge of the peak in the histogram to be @xmath22 erg s@xmath2 ( figure  3c ) .",
    "these cut - off luminosities are also indicated in figure  2 by dashed lines .",
    "these rapid luminosity decreases occurred in the hard - state periods ( from hard - high to hard - low ) , and thus differ from the state transition due to the inner disk transition ( from soft to hard - high ) .",
    "namely , the rapid luminosity decrease occurred at the luminosity lower than the transition luminosity of the soft - to - hard - high .",
    "we extracted luminosity dwell - time distribution during the hard - state period including both the hard - high and hard - low , and determined the cut - off luminosity below which the luminosity start to decrease rapidly .",
    "this cut - off luminosity corresponds to the transition luminosity from the hard - high to the hard - low , when the propeller effect become effective ( ma2013 ) .",
    "if the cut - off luminosity is due to the propeller effect , we can derive the surface magnetic field on the ns ( @xmath23 ) using the following equation ( ma2013 ) :  , @xmath24 are used , following ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) . ]",

    "the ideal alfvn radius @xmath33 is defined in equation ( 27 ) in ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) .",
    "consequently , we can derive the surface magnetic field of the ns to be ( 0.51.6)@xmath3  g for 4u  1608@xmath052 and ( 0.61.9)@xmath3  g for aql  x-1 . here",
    ", we adopted spin periods of 1.62  ms for 4u  1608@xmath052 ( hartman et al . 2003 ) and 1.82  ms for aql  x-1 ( zhang et al . 1998b ) .      as the evidence of the propeller effects , soft - to - hard spectral transitions accompanied with a sudden flux decrease during a outburst decay phase observed in aql  x-1 ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ; zhang et al . 1998 ) as well as 4u  1608@xmath052 ( chen , zhang & ding 2006 ) have ever been suggested .",
    "however , such an incident that characterized by the simultaneous flux decrease and spectral change may occur not only by the propeller effect but also in the inner disk - state transition from the optical thick to the thin one ( e.g. , asai et al . 2012 ) . actually , maccarone and coppi ( 2003 ) pointed out that the propeller effect is not the sole cause of the spectral transitions because the transition luminosities at the outburst rise and the decay phases are significantly different . therefore , to identify the propeller effect correctly",
    ", we need to distinguish it from the inner disk transition .",
    "the previous studies on the propeller effects did not take account of the disk transition properly .",
    "thus , their estimates on the propeller level may not be appropriate .",
    "using the maxi / gsc and swift / bat data covering the wide energy band with more frequent observations and moderate sensitivity , we were able to separate the two transitions clearly , although we can not see a hardness change of bat / gsc hardness ratio by propeller effect clearly since the data is poor in statistics .",
    "this is remarkably different from the previous works .",
    "however , our estimates of the magnetic field strengths on both 4u  1608@xmath052 and aql  x-1 were almost consistent with the previous results ( although ours are slightly small ) .",
    "this is because the two transition luminosities for the inner disk - state transition and the propeller effect are rather close ( within a factor of @xmath10 5 ) .",
    "powell , haswell , and falanga ( 2007 ) , hereafter referred to as phf2007 , reported a knee feature ( they labeled it as a `` brink '' ) in the light curve of outburst decay phase , due to the change of the accretion rate coupled with the disk irradiation .",
    "if the `` brink '' occurred , the decay tendency would change from the exponential to the linear .",
    "this feature has been recognized in both ns - lmxbs and bh - lmxbs .",
    "in fact , our light curves ( figure 1 ) also show the `` brink '' feature characterized by the transition from the exponential to the linear decline in the soft state of 4u  1608@xmath052 marked with s@xmath34 , and that of aql  x-1 marked with s@xmath35 .",

    "campana et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reported the `` brink '' features in both s@xmath37 and s@xmath34 of aql  x-1 .",
    "the rapid luminosity decrease in the hard - high to the hard - low state transition discussed so far may resemble the `` brink '' feature . however , the number of data points are too small to make detailed analysis , and consequently , we can fit the decay curve with either of a single linear function , or a single exponential function .",
    "note that 4u  1608@xmath052 ( i ) has 6 data points in the decay part , and aql  x-1 ( ii ) has only 2 data points .",
    "the decay part of 4u  1608@xmath052 ( iii ) is difficult to be defined because the rapid luminosity decrease occurred several times .",
    "therefore , it was difficult for us to perform useful fittings . however , the rapid luminosity decrease occurred at the end of the long - lasting ( @xmath10 100 days ) hard - high state .",
    "it does not occur when the flux is decaying monotonically from the outburst peak in which the `` brink '' was observed .",
    "thus , the feature of transition from the hard - high to the hard - low state is most probably the propeller effect . here , note that we derived the cut - off luminosity of the propeller effect making the luminosity dwell - time distribution in figure  3 because of no useful fitting analysis .",
    "the propeller effect occurred in the hard - state period in 4u  1608@xmath052 and aql  x-1 .",

    "the rapid decrease started on mjd@xmath1054303 , which accords to the epoch when the transition in the color  color diagram from the z - type to the atoll - type occurred ( lin et al .",

    "the transition from the soft to the hard state occurred on mjd@xmath1054312 ( july 31 , 2007 ) .",
    "this means that the source remained in the soft state when the rapid decrease started .",
    "we consider it possibly due to the propeller effect , and then estimate the surface magnetic field on the ns using the same methods applied to 4u  1608@xmath052 and aql  x-1 .",
    "we derived the luminosity dwell - time distributions in figure  4b for the light curve of figure  4b , where the expected distribution for the gaussian decline model in the light curve is overlaid .",
    "the rapid luminosity decrease after mjd = 54300 corresponds to the lower cut - off in the luminosity distributions at the level pointed by the arrow , which is estimated to be @xmath38 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the cut - off level is also shown on the light curve in figure  4a .",
    "the cut - off luminosity coincides with that when the transition from the z source to the atoll source occurred ( lin et al .",
    "this cut - off is not likely to be a `` brink '' by phf2007 ( described in subsection 3.2 ) since the decrease is exponential ( not linear ) [ see figure  2 in fridriksson et al . (",
    "thus , it can be interpreted as due to the propeller effect where the z  atoll state transition may occur as a consequence of the mass - accretion decrease .",

    "this hypothesis is consistent with our propeller - effect interpretation .",
    "since xte  j1701@xmath0462 had khz qpos , let us assume that the spin period of the ns is in the order of milliseconds .",

    "( 2010 ) discussed a possibility of the propeller effect for this rapid decrease , and mentioned that there are `` several serious problems in general interpretation '' of the outburst decay rate in ns transitions .",
    "one of the `` serious problems '' is in the fact that not only ns - lmxb but also black - hole transients have shown similar rapid - decreasing decay features ( chen et al .",
    "1997:jonker et al .",
    "indeed , the rapid - decreasing decay features were observed in ns - lmxb transients , black - hole transients and also cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , gilfanov et al . 1998 and references therein ) . the common interpretation of `` outer - disk thermal instability '' ( e.g.meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) is proposed ( chen et al .",
