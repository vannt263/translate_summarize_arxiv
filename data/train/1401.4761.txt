    "the low - mass pre - main sequence solar - type stars evolve through different stages .",
    "many of them are at the stage of a classical t tauri star ( ctts ) , where the star becomes visible , but is still surrounded by a protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations show that cttss usually have a strong , dynamically important magnetic field . in these stars",
    ", the accretion disc is truncated by the magnetosphere , and the magnetic field governs the matter flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric and spectral variabilities of these stars are determined by the patterns of matter flow through the magnetosphere and by the shapes and positions of the hot spots .",
    "this problem is three - dimensional , so that the matter flow should be studied in global 3d mhd simulations , while photometry and spectra should be calculated using 3d radiative transfer approaches .",
    "we perform global simulations of matter flow around magnetized young stars using the 3d mhd _ cubed sphere _ code , and afterwards use the obtained results for the calculation of spectra using the 3d radiative transfer code _",
    "torus_.      we use the second - order godunov - type three - dimensional ( 3d ) mhd code developed by our group @xcite .",
    "it has many specific features which are oriented towards the efficient calculation of accretion onto a star with a tilted dipole or a more complex magnetic field : ( 1 ) the magnetic field @xmath0 is decomposed into the `` main '' dipole component of the star , @xmath1 , and the component @xmath2 induced by currents in the disc and the corona @xcite ; ( 2 ) the mhd equations are written in a reference frame rotating with the star ; and ( 3 ) the numerical method uses the  cubed sphere \" grid .",
    "the grid on the surface of the sphere consists of six sectors , with the grid in each sector being topologically equivalent to the grid on a face of a cube ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use a godunov - type numerical scheme similar to the one described by @xcite and perform simulations in three dimensions .",
    "the full set of equations is the following :         @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity of plasma in the rotating frame , @xmath8 is the magnetic field , and @xmath9 is the specific entropy .",
    "@xmath10 is the stress tensor with components @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the gas pressure .",
    "all variables are evaluated at the centers of the cells , and all vector variables are expressed in terms of their cartesian components .",
    "finite difference equations are then written for the variables .",
    "the finite difference scheme of godunov s type has the form : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the  vector \" of the densities of conserved variables ; @xmath15 is the  vector \" of flux densities normal to the face  @xmath16 \" of the grid cell , @xmath17 is the area of the face ",
    "@xmath16 \" , @xmath18 is the volume of the cell , @xmath19 is the intensity of sources in the cell , and @xmath20 is the time step . to calculate the flux densities @xmath15 ,",
    "an approximate riemann solver is used , analogous to the one described by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the grid resolution is either @xmath21 or @xmath22 in each of the 6 blocks of the cube .",
    "the number of grid cells in the radial direction is @xmath23 .",
