    "<S> in nonlinear plasmonics , the switching threshold of optical bistability is limited by the weak nonlinear responses from the conventional kerr dielectric media . considering the giant nonlinear susceptibility of graphene , here we develop a nonlinear scattering model under the mean field approximation and study the bistable scattering in graphene - coated dielectric nanowires based on the semi - analytical solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the switching intensities of bistable scattering can be smaller than @xmath0 at the working frequency . to further decrease the switching intensities , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the most important factor that restricts the bistable scattering is the relaxation time of graphene , rather than the chemical potential and the permittivity of the dielectric nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> our work not only reveals some general characteristics of graphene - based bistable scattering , but also provides a guidance to further applications of optical bistability in the high speed all - optical signal processing . </S>"
