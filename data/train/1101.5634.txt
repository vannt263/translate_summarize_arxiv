    "this plot reproduces the results of @xcite in our system . for a fixed pressure and volume",
    "there are many states with a large difference in their probability .",
    "the least probable states are 10@xmath258 less probable than the most probable state showing a breakdown of equiprobability .",
    "the question is how to interpret the results of ergodicity in the light of the failure of equiprobability and whether there is a need for an extra variable to describe the microstates .",
    "we first mention the issue of the small system size .",
    "it is quite possible that the low probability states will completely disappear in the thermodynamic limit and the ones remaining are the most probable ones with equal probability .",
    "indeed , the flat average assumption is only valid in the thermodynamic limit and simply says that even if there exists less probable states ( @xmath259 less probable ) then they will be irrelevant in the ensemble average , thus only the most probable and flat states are important .",
    "( a )    ( b )    we have done simulations with @xmath26014 particles and found that the least probable states are @xmath261 less probable than the most probable states . comparing with the factor @xmath259 for @xmath123 , may indicate that the system size may take care of the non - equiprobability problem .",

    "the most probable states satisfy : @xmath263    furthermore , if we sum up all the states for a given @xmath262 and plot @xmath264 vs @xmath262 we obtain eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) as seen in fig .",
    "this result does not mean that @xmath262 is the hidden variable but rather eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) provides the density of states proposed in @xcite in the thermodynamics calculation of the random close packing of spheres .",
    "indeed , we have predicted that the density of states @xmath265 , with @xmath266 playing the role of a planck constant defining the minimum size in the volume landscape . according to eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , this prediction is satisfied in average with @xmath267 which is a small number as expected .",
    "this result indicates that some variability in the probabilities of the microstates is expected from the fluctuations in the coordination number of each microstate . in appendix [ z ]",
    "we elaborate an extension of the framework of @xcite to incorporate fluctuations in @xmath11 that are neglected in @xcite .",
    "the purpose is to test whether the rcp and jamming transition are affected by these fluctuations .",
    "we find that the results are consistent with those found in @xcite .",
    "we notice that for a fix @xmath262 there are still many marginal states with very small probabilities as seen in fig .",
    "if these states do not completely disappear in the thermodynamic limit , then they need to be explained .",
    "we end this discussion by providing a possible explanation for the existence of these states .",
    "the numerical breakdown of equiprobability might be related to the fact that the found packings are not indistinguishable .",
    "indeed , we ignore the rotation and translation symmetries of the packing in order to make the numerical search possible .",
    "however , for the edwards flat hypothesis , these packings should be assumed different .",
    "once we breakdown the rotational symmetry , there would be many similar packings .",
    "the high degeneracy of the high symmetric packings may be responsible for the uneven distribution , which would be , in this case , simply artificial .",
    "for instance , consider two packings with 4 particles : ( a ) a square packing with each particle on the corner and ( b ) a triangle with each particle in each corner plus one in the center .",
    "for both packings there are 4 !",
    "= 24 different permutations , which should be considered as 24 different packings , in principle . however , since we can rotate the square packing by 90 degree and obtain the same one , there are only 24/4 = 6 distinguishable packings .",
    "similarly , for the triangle , there are 24/3 = 8 distinguishable packings .",
    "the probability between ( a ) and ( b ) is uneven ( 6:8 ) if we assume that each distinguishable packing is equal - probable .",
    "therefore , different symmetries of the packings may contribute to the unequal probabilities that we measure in the algorithms .",
    "therefore , if the edwards assumption is correct , @xmath255 should be proportional to @xmath268 , where @xmath268 is the order of the symmetry group ( point group ) of the packing @xmath256 , since there are @xmath268 degenerations ( same packing if particles are identical ) .",
    "this conjecture needs extra evaluation of the symmetry of each packing .",
    "for instance , the translation invariance is important , and for cubic periodic boundary , it is also important to include the symmetry of cubic point group c@xmath269 .",
    "we do not investigate this conjecture but rather provide the codes and packings in http://jamlab.org to do that .",
    "since the 3d case is complicated , one might try the 2d system first to easily visualize different packings .",
    "a simple question is : given two packings with different frequencies , how do they look like @xcite ? would be the high symmetric one visited more , or inversely ?",
    "we have demonstrated that the concept of `` thermalization '' at a compactivity and angoricity in jammed systems is reasonable by the direct test of ergodicity .",
    "the numerical results indicate that the full canonical ensemble of pressure and volume describes the observables near the jamming transition quite well . from a static thermodynamic viewpoint ,",
    "the jamming phase transition does not present critical fluctuations characteristic of second - order transitions since the fluctuations of several observables vanish approaching jamming .",
    "the lack of critical fluctuations is respect to the angoricity and compactivity in the jammed phase @xmath270 , which does not preclude the existence of critical fluctuations when accounting for the full range of fluctuations in the liquid to jammed transition below @xmath150 .",
    "thus , a critical diverging length scale might still appear as @xmath271 @xcite , which has been recently observed by experiment @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results suggest an ensemble treatment of the jamming transition . one possible analytical route to use this formalism would be to incorporate the coupling between volume and coordination number at the particle level found in @xcite together with similar dependence for the stress to solve the partition function . this treatment would allow analytical solutions for the observables with the goal of characterizing the scaling laws near the jamming transition .",

    "<S> we find that edwards thermodynamics is able to describe the jamming transition ( j - point ) . </S>",
    "<S> using the ensemble formalism we elucidate the following : _ ( i ) _ we test the combined volume - stress ensemble by comparing the statistical properties of jammed configurations obtained by dynamics with those averaged over the ensemble of minima in the potential energy landscape as a test of ergodicity . agreement between both methods supports the idea of `` thermalization '' at a given angoricity and compactivity . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ a microcanonical ensemble analysis supports the idea of maximum entropy principle for grains . _ ( iii ) _ the intensive variables describe the approach to jamming through a series of scaling relations as @xmath2 and @xmath3 . due to the force - volume coupling , the jamming transition can be probed thermodynamically by a `` jamming temperature '' @xmath4 comprised of contributions from @xmath1 and @xmath0 . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ the thermodynamic framework reveals the order of the jamming phase transition by showing the absence of critical fluctuations at jamming in observables like pressure and volume . _ ( v ) _ finally , we elaborate on a comparison with relevant studies showing a breakdown of equiprobability of microstates .    </S>",
    "<S> the application of concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics to out of equilibrium systems has a long history of describing diverse systems ranging from glasses to granular materials @xcite . for dissipative jammed systems particulate grains or droplets </S>",
    "<S> the key concept proposed by edwards is to replace the energy ensemble describing conservative systems by the volume ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approach alone is not able to describe the jamming point ( j - point ) for deformable particles like emulsions and droplets @xcite , whose geometric configurations are influenced by the applied external stress </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the volume ensemble requires augmentation by the ensemble of stresses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> just as volume fluctuations can be described by compactivity , the stress fluctuations give rise to an angoricity , another analogue of temperature in equilibrium systems .    in the past 20 years since the publication of edwards work </S>",
    "<S> there has been many attempts to understand and test the foundations of the thermodynamics of powders and grains . </S>",
    "<S> three approaches are relevant to the present study :    * * experimental studies of reversibility. * starting with the experiments of chicago which were reproduced by other groups @xcite , a well - defined experimental protocol has been introduced to achieve reversible states in granular matter . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments indicate that systematically shaken granular materials show reversible behavior and therefore are amenable to a statistical mechanics approach , despite the frictional and dissipative character of the material . </S>",
    "<S> these results are complemented by direct measurements of compactivity and effective temperatures in granular media @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> * numerical test of ergodicity. * numerical simulations compare the ensemble average of observables with those obtained from direct dynamical measures in granular matter and glasses . </S>",
    "<S> these studies @xcite find general agreement between both measures and , together with the experimental studies of reversibility @xcite , suggest that ergodicity might work in granular media . </S>",
    "<S> * * numerical and experimental studies of equiprobability of jammed states. * exhaustive searches of all jammed states are conducted in small systems to test the equiprobability of jammed states , as a foundation of the microcanonical ensemble of grains . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations and experiments indicate that jammed states are not equiprobable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that a hidden extra variable @xcite might be needed to describe jammed granular matter in contrast with the work in * 1 * and * 2*.    the current situation can be summarized as following : when directly tested or exploited in practical applications , edwards ensemble seems to work well . </S>",
    "<S> these include studies where ensemble and dynamical measurements are directly compared , and recent applications of the formalism to predict random close packing of monodisperse spherical particles @xcite , polydisperse systems @xcite , and two @xcite and high dimensional systems @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , a direct count of microstates reveals problems at the foundation of the framework manifested in the breakdown of the flat average assumption in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the edwards ensemble of granular matter focusing on describing the jamming transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a short version of this study has been recently published in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a strategy that mixes the approaches * 2 * and * 3 * above . </S>",
    "<S> we first perform an exhaustive search of all jammed configurations in the potential energy landscape ( pel ) of small frictionless systems in the spirit of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this information to perform a direct test of ergodicity in the spirit of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate : _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ the dynamical and ensemble measurements of presure , coordination number , volume , and distribution of forces agree well , supporting ergodicity . </S>",
    "<S> a microcanonical ensemble analysis supports also a maximum entropy principle for grains . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ intensive variables like angoricity , @xmath1 , and compactivity , @xmath0 , describe the approach to jamming through a series of scaling relations . due to the force - volume coupling </S>",
    "<S> , the jamming transition can be probed thermodynamically by a `` jamming temperature '' @xmath4 comprised of contributions from @xmath1 and @xmath0 . _ ( iii ) _ these intensive variables elucidate the thermodynamic order of the jamming phase transition by showing the absence of critical fluctuations above jamming in static observables like pressure and volume . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the jamming transition is not critical and there is no critical correlation length arising from a thermodynamic n - point correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss other possible correlation lengths . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ surprisingly , we reproduce the results of @xcite regarding the failure of equiprobability of microstates while obtaining the correct dynamics measurements as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then offer a possible solution to this conundrum to elucidate why the microstates seems to be not equiprobable while the ensemble averages produce the correct results .    </S>",
