    "this is the first of a series of papers studying the existence of bounded solutions of the equation @xmath7 where @xmath5  and @xmath2  are positive parameters .",
    "this equation is a standard model in the theory of nonlinear oscillations , one of several which have been called a forced duffing equation in the literature .  with the signs shown it",
    "is often referred to as the equation of a `` soft spring . ''",
    "a comprehensive reference to the early theory of @xmath8 is @xcite , which gives a detailed account of the results obtained by classical perturbation methods , such as averaging or multi - scale techniques .",
    "more recent efforts have used dynamical systems concepts to establish results about chaotic behavior of one sort or another .",
    "an important reference is by angenent , mallet - paret , and peletier @xcite , who studied stable steady states for a reaction - diffusion equation @xmath9 with boundary conditions @xmath10 for a class of functions",
    "@xmath11 which were cubic in the state variable @xmath12  equation @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 by setting @xmath15 and assuming that @xmath16  is independent of @xmath17  while the specific form @xmath8 is not mentioned in @xcite ,  the methods there are easily seen to apply and to prove important results about the existence of stable steady - states of the problem @xmath18 with this function @xmath19  compactness requirements , however , seem to make it more difficult to study the problem on an infinite interval , and thereby get `` chaos '' , using infinite dimensional methods .     in this paper",
    "we introduce a shooting technique , which we have not seen in this form elsewhere , which is the basis of our approach .",
    "we use this technique to obtain new periodic solutions for @xmath8 over a range of @xmath2 which is not `` small '' .",
    "we show that one can give rigorous results about a weak form of `` chaos '' over this larger range of @xmath1  we also introduce the problem of determining how these solutions arise as @xmath5 varies , since for @xmath20 , @xmath21 will be shown to have a unique bounded solution .  then , letting @xmath2 return to its traditional role as a small parameter , we reproduce and extend the results in @xcite as they apply to this equation , using elementary ode methods .",
    "we study the bifurcation problem in @xmath5 in more detail ,  and we begin our study of a further class of bounded solutions which we can find for small @xmath1     however , a detailed study of this new class of solutions has proven rather lengthy , so we will leave its elaboration to a later paper .  the goal of that paper will be to obtain a general chaos result which includes all of the solutions discussed in each paper , in some sense .",
    "it is anticipated that there will be still a third paper devoted to this topic , in which we use techniques from @xcite to study the stability of the new solutions , as equilibria of @xmath22  this will lead to a consideration of the morse index of these solutions , and their role as part of the global attractor for @xmath23  future work will include extension of the results to more general equations .     in most of this paper we will consider the ode @xmath8 for its own sake .",
    "the literature is large , and it is surprising that , as far as we have been able to determine , many of the solutions we will find have not been described before .",
    "some of these solutions are periodic and some are `` chaotic '' in a sense to be defined below .  those which are periodic are unstable as steady - states of @xmath24 and therefore apparently not found by the pde techniques of @xcite",
    ".  however recent work of k. nakashima on a similar problem uses continuation methods which may yield results similar to some of ours for this problem , such as the existence of these new periodic solutions @xcite .",
    "there have been many other papers on the problem @xmath25 with cubic nonlinearities , and some of these also consider unstable solutions .",
    "two recent ones , which cite other related work , are by hale and salazar @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an earlier paper by kurland gives many oscillatory solutions which are similar to some of those we find in section 4.2 , but for a different class of nonlinear functions @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the use of formal asymptotic analysis on similar problems has been studied by ockendon , ockendon and johnson @xcite , norbury and yeh @xcite and mays and norbury @xcite .",
    "all of these papers use methods which appear to quite different from ours , and study , for the most part , equations different from @xmath27 .",
    "we have not investigated whether these methods , many using infinite dimensional functional analysis or sophisticated topology , apply to @xmath28 .",
    "most do not mention equations of the general form of ours , ( as in @xmath29 below ) , @xcite being a notable exception .",
    "most do not study problems on an infinite interval , so that chaos is not considered .",
    "we have seen no other work on the bifurcation problem considered in section 4.5 .",
    "the proof of a weak form of chaos which we give seems to us to be very simple .",
    "no analysis is required beyond a simple phase plane argument and the continuity of solutions with respect to initial conditions .",
    "see theorem [ thm4 ]  and also the first part of section [ sec3.4 ] .",
    "this is for small @xmath1  for larger @xmath2 a few estimates are needed to verify the hypotheses of theorem [ thm4 ] .",
    "these also appear in section [ sec3.4 ] .     to relate our results to those of traditional nonlinear oscillation theory , we recall that in @xcite the undamped form of the equation is written as @xmath30 this form is chosen to study `` near - resonance '' phenomena , which were the main interest of much previous work .",
    "resonance , or near - resonance , will play no role in our approach , since we are not studying a small perturbation of a linear problem .",
    "a rescaling of @xmath31 to put the equation in the form @xmath8 shows that @xmath2 small in @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath5  large in @xmath32 though the analogy is not exact because this rescaling also results in a small amplitude high frequency forcing .",
    "the paper is organized partly according to the restrictions place on @xmath1  propositions [ thm0 ] ,  [ thm01 ] , [ thm02 ] , and theorem [ thm02a ]  in section [ sec2 ] , are for any @xmath33  the results in section 3 are for a range of @xmath2  which can be stated explicitly , while the results in section 4  are for `` sufficiently small '' @xmath1  a more detailed outline of the paper can be found in section 5 .",
    "at this initial stage it is easy , and we believe of some interest , to study a more general class of equations .",
    "so to start with , consider the equation @xmath34 where @xmath35is any continuous bounded function on @xmath36 with initial conditions    @xmath37 we denote the unique solution by @xmath38 our initial interest for a general @xmath39 is to find solutions which are bounded on @xmath40  fixing @xmath41 this can be viewed as a bifurcation problem in @xmath42  there is a `` main branch ''  of bounded solutions which exist for all @xmath43 as given in the following result .",
    "[ thm0 ]  for any @xmath44  and any @xmath43 @xmath45 has a solution satisfying @xmath46 which is bounded on @xmath40    choose @xmath47  so large that if @xmath48  then @xmath49  for any @xmath50 then ,  @xmath51  when @xmath52  and @xmath53  when @xmath54  we define two subsets of the @xmath55 axis:@xmath56 these sets are clearly non - empty ( e.g. @xmath57 ) and open .",
    "they are disjoint because @xmath58 can not have a local maximum in the region @xmath59 or a local minimum in the region @xmath60  hence there is an @xmath61 and this corresponds to a solution which is bounded on @xmath40 this proves proposition [ thm0 ] .    it should be remarked that for any even function @xmath62 such as cosine , the solutions @xmath58 are even and so @xmath63 is bounded on the whole real line .",
    "[ thm01 ]  for any @xmath20 there is only one solution of @xmath64 which is bounded on @xmath40    suppose that there are two bounded solutions , say @xmath65 and @xmath66 and let @xmath67 then @xmath68 and since @xmath69 is positive definite and @xmath70  @xmath71  can not be bounded on @xmath72 .",
    "this proves the result .",
    "a similar argument shows that for a general continuous bounded function @xmath73 when @xmath20 there is exactly one solution of @xmath74 which is bounded on @xmath75 however the existence part of this result is a little longer , requiring a two - parameter `` shooting '' argument and some more complicated topology .",
    "we now consider what happens as @xmath5 increases from zero .",
    "consider the function @xmath76  as @xmath5 crosses zero , @xmath77 develops , by a `` pitchfork bifurcation '' , two new roots ( besides @xmath78 a local maximum at @xmath79  and a local minimum at @xmath80  as @xmath5 increases further ,  the value of @xmath81 at these maxima and minima will eventually exceed the maximum of @xmath82 let @xmath83    [ thm02]if @xmath84  then for any @xmath44  there is a unique bounded solution with @xmath85  @xmath86  ,  and another bounded solution , also unique , with @xmath87  @xmath88    existence of these solutions is a simple application of the shooting technique from proposition [ thm0 ] .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath89 then at @xmath90 where @xmath91  has a local minimum , @xmath92  we consider solutions @xmath58 with @xmath93 for @xmath55 in this region and close to @xmath94 @xmath58 decreases and crosses @xmath95 transversely .  for @xmath55 in this region and close to @xmath96 @xmath58 increases and crosses @xmath97 , again transversely .",
    "it easily follows that there is a solution @xmath58 such that @xmath98  for all @xmath99  similarly , a second solution is found with @xmath100 uniqueness of both of these solutions follows as in proposition  [ thm01 ] .",
    "we believe that there should be a third bounded solution as well , but we do nt have a proof for a general continuous bounded function @xmath101  there appears to be a significant difference between boundary value problems on finite intervals , such as those in @xcite , and the semi - infinite interval problem discussed here .  it is easy to show , for a bounded @xmath39 and any given @xmath102  that for large enough @xmath5 there are at least three solutions of @xmath103 such that @xmath104  but it does not appear to us to be so easy to find three bounded solutions on @xmath40  `` generically '' there should be three , perhaps by some sort of degree theory argument , but the non - compactness of @xmath72 seems to make the use of such arguments more challenging .     * *    so now we specialize to the equation of principle interest , namely @xmath105 it is useful to consider the curve in the @xmath106 plane defined implicitly by the equation @xmath107 that is , by @xmath108  this curve has one component for @xmath109  and three components for @xmath110 .",

    "we will not try to formulate a precise result here .",
    "we did use symmetry essentially to obtain the existence of the solution @xmath1326  it is here that we have found significant differences between the problem of finding steady - states for @xmath24 on a finite interval and the problem of finding bounded solutions , and chaos , on an infinite interval .",
    "it is easy to find a third solution to the boundary value problem on a finite interval using shooting .",
    "from there one can go on to find many other solutions , both stable and unstable .  but dealing with chaos on an infinite interval seems different , and it is for that reason that we concentrated on the particular equation @xmath8 .",
    "having done so , it is natural to make use of symmetry to obtain simpler proofs in some cases where a shooting method may apply even without symmetry .",
    "we note , however , that the proof of theorem [ thm4 ] , which does not use symmetry , includes the existence of a solution which does not intersect any of the @xmath339  this solution is the stable solution of @xcite ,  and could play the role of @xmath227 in a study which uses shooting but does not use symmetry .",
    "the proof of stability of the solution @xmath227 ( theorem [ thm8 ] ) does not use symmetry , but does use the fact that the derivative of cosine is negative in @xmath274 .",
    "we do not believe that this property should be crucial to obtaining an elementary proof of linearized stability , and we expect that our proof will extend to more general forcing functions , but this is the subject of future investigation .",
    "the assumptions in @xcite imply that the forcing function @xmath39 is monotone in a neighborhood of any of its zeros , and this should allow our proof to go through",
    ". however the result will probably be weaker in that @xmath1256 will be restricted more .",
    "we make use of lemma [ alem7.2 ] , about the monotonicity of the maxima and minima in @xmath274 , a number of times , and this also relies on the monotonicity of cosine in this interval .",
    "our future work will include a study of how results will change without this condition , but we expect that extensions will be possible",
    ".    the results about bifurcation as @xmath5 increases , however , may change radically if @xmath39 has less symmetry .",
    "for example , if @xmath39 has period @xmath1379  and is symmetric around @xmath556 but not anti - symmetric around @xmath1483 then the solutions will not appear in symmetric pairs .",
    "the technique we have used may still be able to prove that saddle - node bifurcations occur , at least in a nearly - symmetric situation , but there may be two of them , producing first two new solutions and then two more .",

    "we give preliminary results valid for all @xmath33 some of these are for a more general forcing function @xmath1484 the main points are that for @xmath20  there is a unique bounded solution , which is periodic , while for @xmath110 there are at least three solutions",
    ".  therefore a bifurcation takes place , and some computations are given in section 4.5 indicating that this can be of different types depending on @xmath1484    in section 3  we give results valid for a specific range of @xmath2  and @xmath42  the main hypothesis is condition [ a ] ,  the existence of `` spikes '' , ( the @xmath1485 which are solutions tending to @xmath1486 in both directions .",
    "solutions are characterized by which of the @xmath336 they intersect .",
    "section 3.1 gives the proof of the 1:1 correspondence with certain sequences if condition [ a ] holds .",
    "it would be possible to rephrase this result to give a natural correspondence with sequences of three symbols , corresponding to the three solutions which we later labeled @xmath1487 and @xmath505  in 3.2 we give a brief discussion of `` kneading theory '' in our context .  in section 3.3  the symbolic dynamics",
    "is extended to sequences of five symbols . in section 3.4  condition [ a ]",
    "is verified , first for `` sufficiently small '' @xmath509 where no analysis is required , and then for larger @xmath1    the results in section 3 do not include uniqueness or stability , and there is only a limited sensitivity to initial conditions demonstrated .",
    "they do not depend at all on symmetry , and indeed , the techniques will yield a weak form of chaos for a wide variety of forcing functions , including non - periodic forcing .",
    "section 4 contains a variety of results , all proved for sufficiently small @xmath2 with no estimate on the range of @xmath2 for which they hold .  in 4.1 some results",
    "are given about asymptotic behavior of solutions as @xmath693  in 4.2 further periodic solutions are found , including solutions with multiple internal layers and with a `` down - jump '' near @xmath222 ,  in contrast to the solution @xmath227 which jumps upward at @xmath222 .  in 4.3",
    "we give a proof of the stability of @xmath227 using classical ode methods , and extend the result on uniqueness of @xcite  a bit by obtaining a larger region in which it is unique .",
    "the uniqueness proof is also more direct than that in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 5.1 ,  we discuss the role of the specific cosine forcing function in our results , and conjecture that its symmetry and monotonicity properties may not be essential except in the bifurcation analysis of section 4.6 .",
