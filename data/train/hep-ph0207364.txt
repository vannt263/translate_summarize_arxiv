    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions is the present paradigm of particle physics .",
    "its validity has been tested to a level better than one per mille at particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are arguments against the sm being the fundamental model of particle interactions  @xcite , giving rise to the investigation of competing alternative or extended models , which can be tested at high - energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , or a @xmath10 linear collider ( lc )  @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising possibilities for physics beyond the sm is the incorporation of supersymmetry ( susy ) , which leads to a renormalizable field theory with precisely calculable predictions to be tested in future experiments .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite . up to now the major effort on the computation of susy radiative corrections",
    "has been put into the computation of virtual susy effects in observables that involve only sm external particles , or into the calculation of loop effects in the extended higgs sector of the mssm . in this context , if the masses of the extra non - standard particles are very large as compared to the sm electroweak scale , the effects of these particles decouple , leaving the sm as a low - energy effective theory .",
    "this means that if the extra particles are too heavy we could not discern between the sm and the mssm by just looking at the low - energy end of the spectrum , since the only trace of the mssm would be a light higgs boson ( @xmath11 )  @xcite , whose properties would not differ from the sm one .",
    "but for the case of direct production of susy particles , one also needs a detailed knowledge of the higher - order effects for the processes with these susy particles in the external states .",
    "in contrast to the case of virtual susy effects in sm green s functions , there is a great variety of additional electroweak mssm processes , viz .",
    "those involving higgs bosons and/or ( r - odd ) sparticles in the external legs , for which the decoupling limit can not be applied . in this case",
    "several kinds of non - decoupling effects may appear which grow with the mass of the sparticles  @xcite .",
    "these effects can be very important , as they could provide the clue to discovering susy physics in the colliders .",
    "this was amply demonstrated in the past for decay processes  @xcite , and also very recently for production cross - sections in hadron colliders@xcite , in both cases exploiting the susy threshold corrections in the top quark and higgs boson sector . in the present study , however , we will face not only threshold effects , but also a new type of non - decoupling ( so - called universal ) contributions .",
    "both types of non - decoupling effects have to be considered for a complete study of sfermion decays in the colliders .",
    "the lhc will be able to discover new particles with masses up to @xmath12 .",
    "provided they are not too heavy , the lc will be able to make precision measurements of their properties .",
    "for example , at a @xmath13 lc with a total integrated luminosity of @xmath14 a measurement of the top - squark mass and the top - squark mixing angle can be performed with a precision of @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively  @xcite . for an adequate analysis ,",
    "precise theoretical predictions are required , going beyond the born approximation .",
    "these studies of purely supersymmetric processes at the quantum level are necessary not only to refine the prediction of the corresponding observables but also because 1 ) the quantum corrections may severely affect the physical production of the supersymmetric particles , and 2 ) in addition they probe the underlying susy nature present in the model , that is : the relation between the gauge couplings of the sm gauge bosons and the yukawa coupling of its susy partners ( charginos and neutralinos ) . beyond leading order this relation receives corrections which are non - decoupling .",
    "a number of studies have already addressed this issue , for production as well as for decay processes . for squark and gluino production in hadron collisions ,",
    "the nlo qcd corrections are available  @xcite ; for squark - pair production in @xmath10 collisions , the nlo qcd are also known , together with the yukawa corrections  @xcite . concerning the subsequent squark decays into charginos / neutralinos ,",
    "the qcd corrections were presented in  @xcite , was studied in  @xcite . here",
    "we will assume @xmath17 .",
    "] , whereas the yukawa corrections were given in  @xcite . in this",
    "last work large corrections were found .",
    "they were derived , however , in the _ higgsino _ approximation for the chargino ; hence , a full computation is required to consolidate the significance of the loop effects .",
    "we have performed a complete one - loop computation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the partial decay widths of sfermions into fermions and charginos / neutralinos , @xmath18 we present the structure of the corrections in detail , and illustrate their main features and their significance in representative numerical examples .",
    "explicit results are displayed for all kind of sfermions .",
    "first results of this study were presented in ref.@xcite .    in processes with exclusively sm particles in external states , it is possible to divide the one - loop contributions into sm - like and non - sm - like subclasses .",
    "this separate treatment is often used in the literature , and it is useful since it allows to make the computation in small steps , checking each sector individually . as a distinctive feature of the radiative corrections to processes with supersymmetric particles in the external legs ,",
    "this separability is lost . in such kind of processes",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of diagrams with virtual sm particles cancel the uv divergences of diagrams with non - sm particles .",
    "any partial computation would yield uv - divergent and thus meaningless results .",
    "for this reason we have to compute the entire set of one - loop contributions for our processes , with the proper counterterms involving the renormalization of almost the full mssm lagrangian . as a direct consequence ,",
    "many non - decoupling effects appear .",
    "moreover , we remark that since we have sparticles in the external legs a consistent calculation of the loop integrals requires the use of dimensional reduction in order that the regularization procedure preserves supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : renor ] contains the renormalization of the sfermion sector ( section  [ sec : renorsf ] ) , the chargino / neutralino sector ( section  [ sec : renorcn ] ) , and their interaction ( section  [ sec : renorlagrangian ] ) . the numerical analysis in done in section",

    "the higgs sector of the mssm has received a lot of attention in the literature  @xcite .",
    "here we follow ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , the only ingredient of the higgs sector needed at one - loop order for renormalization of the sfermion and the chargino - neutralino sectors is the renormalization of @xmath25 .",
    "the counterterm is determined by the condition for the counterterms of the two vacuum expectation values , @xmath26 together with the absence of mixing between the on - shell @xmath27 higgs boson and the @xmath28 weak gauge boson , which gives @xmath29 our choice of @xmath30 is based on simplicity .",
    "it is known that all definitions of @xmath30 not directly related to a physical observable are subject to some gauge dependence and/or induce large variations of the corrections with the parameters , free of these problems , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . as a drawback , however , one has to compute the process - dependent corrections .",
    "see also  @xcite for a recent review on this subject . ] . in our case",
    "the dependence is small and , with this simple and well tested definition , we can avoid introducing process - dependent corrections in a framework , like ours , which is already quite cumbersome .",
    "needless to say , the physical observables we are addressing , like decay rates and branching ratios , are completely insensitive to our particular choice of @xmath30 .",
    "besides parameter renormalization , we introduce field - renormalization constants for each particle . exploiting the freedom in the treatment of field renormalization ,",
    "they have been chosen in a way to get fairly simple expressions for the physical observables under study .      throughout this paper",
    "we will be using the 3th family squarks as a generic fermion - sfermion notation .",
    "the same relations hold for sleptons , by changing the corresponding charges appropriately .",
    "we denote the two sfermion - mass eigenvalues by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . the sfermion - mixing angle @xmath33 is defined by the transformation relating the weak - interaction ( @xmath34 ) and the mass eigenstate ( @xmath35 ) sfermion bases : @xmath36 by this basis transformation , the sfermion mass matrix , @xmath37 becomes diagonal : @xmath38 .",

    "the mixing parameters in the non - diagonal entries read @xmath44    our aim is to compute the radiative corrections in an on - shell renormalization scheme ; hence , the input parameters are physical observables ( i.e.  the physical masses @xmath45 ,  ) rather than formal parameters in the lagrangian ( i.e.  the soft - susy - breaking parameters @xmath46 ,   in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbottommatrix ] ) ) .",
    "specifically , we use the following set of independent parameters for the squark sector : @xmath47 the value of the other stop mass , @xmath48 , is derived from this set of input parameters .",
    "the sbottom and stop trilinear soft - susy - breaking terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fixed at the tree - level by the previous parameters as follows : @xmath51 we impose the approximate ( necessary ) condition @xmath52 where @xmath53 is of the order of the average squark masses for @xmath54 , to avoid colour - breaking minima in the mssm higgs potential@xcite .",
    "of course the relation  ( [ eq : abt ] ) receives one - loop corrections ; however , since these parameters do not enter the tree - level expressions , these effects translate into two - loop corrections to the process under study .",
    "the bound  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) translates into a stringent constraint to the sbottom - quark mixing angle for moderate and large values of @xmath55 : with an approximate limit @xmath56 from the negative output of the chargino search at lep , the condition  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) can only be satisfied by a cancellation of the two terms in  ( [ eq : abt ] ) which is easily spoiled when @xmath57 is varied . however , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : necessary ] ) is not rigorous  @xcite ; so we will present results also when this bound is not satisfied , but we will clearly mark these regions . with the use of the bound  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) also the squark - squark - higgs - boson couplings are restricted .",
    "this is a welcome feature , since these couplings can in general be very large , eventually spoiling perturbativity .",
    "the slepton sector follows the same procedure , but only one sneutrino is present . thus the input parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inputb ] ) are reduced to the charged slepton masses and mixing angle .",

    "the mixing angle renormalization must also be given . since there is no unique concept of an _ on - shell angle _",
    ", a practical definition is given , which is general enough to be used in any sfermion observable .",
    "other definitions of an _ on - shell _ scheme are also conceivable .",
    "one could think , for example , of a concept having all the sfermions defined on - shell , so that the input parameters would be the four masses and one mixing angle .",
    "such a scheme , however , is problematic .",
    "first of all , this input parameter set is not complete , and one needs to give also the sign of the angle to determine completely the parameters of the sfermion section .",
    "second , the expression derived for the counterterm of the mixing angle is not well defined when the angle is zero ( no mixing ) .",
    "admittedly , the zero - mixing - angle case could be thought of as an academic limit ; it is , however , a very useful scenario for the study of sfermions at colliders , and has widely been used accordingly .",

    "the non - decoupling of gauginos was already discussed in  @xcite . there , the qcd corrections to the squark decays were computed , and an explicit non - decoupling gaugino term ( of the form @xmath272 ) was found .",

    "the electroweak corrections present several peculiarities that prevent from obtaining a simple analytical result of these logarithms .",
    "first of all , the non - decoupling particles are part of the final state of the process , thus if their masses are large the decay will be phase - space closed .",
    "second , the complicated structure of the electroweak sector involves the mixing of gauginos and higgsinos .",

    "one has to be careful in the use of the effective bottom - quark mass  ( [ eq : mbdef ] ) in the case of positive corrections ( @xmath344 ) , since in this case the effective yukawa coupling grows and can become non - perturbative for large values of @xmath222 and @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdcorr]d we show a scenario with @xmath344 .",
    "the input parameters are those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inputssb ] ) , but changing the sign of @xmath142 and the soft - susy - breaking trilinear couplings @xmath315 .",
    "although the corrections are still negative , we clearly see the change of trend for large @xmath345 ; from this point onwards the ( positive ) threshold corrections are comparable to the effects of the running bottom quark mass . at @xmath346",
    "the two leading contributions nearly compensate each other , giving a total negative correction below @xmath347 .",
    "so at large @xmath25 some channels become essentially free of huge negative corrections , whereas in the original @xmath343 scenario these channels were reduced by more than @xmath348 due to quantum effects !    in ref .",
    "@xcite the numerical results for the qcd corrections to the partial sbottom decay widths were much smaller than those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdcorr ] .",
    "the reason is that in ref .",
    "@xcite the following set of parameters was used : a low value of @xmath25 ( @xmath349 ) , small splitting between the two sbottom masses ( @xmath350 ) , and a small sbottom mixing angle ( @xmath351 ) . under these conditions the susy threshold corrections to the bottom yukawa coupling ( @xmath331 ) are suppressed  @xcite . moreover , the choice of @xmath344 in ref .",
    "@xcite would mean that the finite threshold effects partially compensate for the renormalization group running of the bottom mass , thus decreasing the value of the corrections . at moderate or large values of   ( @xmath352 ) , however , the rest of the conditions can not be fulfilled . if the sbottom mixing angle were small ( @xmath351 )",
    ", then the soft - susy - breaking trilinear coupling would be large ( @xmath353 ) , eventually spoiling the vacua condition  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) . even if one drops the condition  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) , then the weak corrections would blow up due to the non - perturbativity of the higgs - squark - squark trilinear coupling entering the three - point function corrections in fig .",
    "[ diags:3point ] .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that sticking to the necessary condition  ( [ eq : necessary ] ) provides a natural suppression of the higgs - squark - squark trilinear coupling , while maintaining the perturbativity of the weak corrections over the whole @xmath25 range . at the same time , it means that for @xmath354 the two sbottom masses have significant splitting , and @xmath355 , providing large corrections due to the finite threshold effects .",
    "we remark that whereas the finite threshold corrections ( @xmath331 ) can be regarded as _ non - decoupling _ effects in the study of the higgs sector of the mssm , this is not so for the sfermion decays under consideration ( even though we have kept the _ non - decoupling _ denomination also in our case ) .",
    "indeed , the non - decoupling property applies when _ all _ the susy parameters ( @xmath142 , @xmath49 , @xmath356 , @xmath357 ) are simultaneously scaled . however , being the sbottom quark mass itself the process energy , the scaling of the susy parameters entails a simultaneous scaling of the process energy , and therefore the @xmath331 corrections can not be considered here as genuine non - decoupling quantum effects .",
    "moreover , in an scenario of large @xmath142 ( @xmath358 ) the light chargino is basically a gaugino , and so its coupling to quarks and squarks is essentially a gauge coupling , not a yukawa coupling . as a result",

    "in particular we have to include the qcd and the threshold effects . in the following analysis",
    "we also take into account the ( generally small ) effects of the shift of the masses in the phase - space factor .",

    "must be taken into account in any computation involving loop diagrams with external fermion - sfermion - chargino / neutralino couplings . in some cases , however , the term multiplying this logarithm is small .",

    "<S> a kind of universal corrections is identified , which allow to define effective chargino / neutralino coupling matrices . in turn , these interactions generate ( universal ) non - decoupling terms that grow as the logarithm of the heavy mass . therefore the full mssm spectrum must be taken into account in the computation of radiative corrections to observables involving these interactions . as an application we analyze the full one - loop electroweak radiative corrections to the partial decay widths @xmath0 and @xmath1 for all sfermion flavours and generations . </S>",
    "<S> these are combined with the qcd corrections to compute the corrected branching ratios of sfermions . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the electroweak corrections can have an important impact on the partial decay widths , as well as the branching ratios , in wide regions of the parameter space . </S>",
