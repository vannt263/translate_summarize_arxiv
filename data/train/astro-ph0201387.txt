    "the red giant branch ( rgb ) is one of the most prominent and well populated features in the color - magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) of stellar populations with ages larger than about @xmath0 gyr .",
    "the theoretical modelling of rgb stars plays therefore a wide ranging role , involving various fields of galactic and extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "since rgb stars are cool , reach high luminosities during their evolution , and their evolutionary timescales are relatively long , they provide a major contribution to the integrated bolometric magnitude and to integrated colors and spectra at wavelengths larger than about 900  1000 nm of old distant , unresolved stellar populations ( e.g. renzini & fusi - pecci  1988 ; worthey  1994 ) .",
    "a correct theoretical prediction of the rgb spectral properties and colors is thus of paramount importance for interpreting observations of distant stellar clusters and galaxies using population synthesis methods , but also for determining the ages of resolved globular and open clusters , by means of isochrone fitting techniques .",
    "the @xmath1-band brightness of the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) provides a robust standard candle , very much independent of the stellar age and initial chemical composition , which can allow to obtain reliable distances out to about 10 mpc using @xmath2 observations ( e.g. , lee , freedman & madore  1993  lfm93 ) . due to the lingering uncertainties on the empirical determination of the trgb brightness zero point",
    ", rgb models provide an independent path to the calibration of this important standard candle ( salaris & cassisi  1997 ) .",
    "also the theoretical calibration of the luminosity of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and their rr lyrae population ( whose parallax - based distances still show a very large error bar ; see , e.g. , groenewegen & salaris  1999 ) is dependent on the correct modelling of the previous rgb phase , since hb luminosities ( like the trgb ones ) are determined by the value of the electron degenerate he - core mass ( @xmath3 ) at the end of the rgb evolution",
    ".    predicted evolutionary timescales along the rgb phase play a fundamental role in the determination of the initial he abundance of globular cluster stars through the r parameter ( number ratio between hb stars and rgb stars brighter than the hb at the rr lyrae instability strip level ; see , e.g. iben  1968a , sandquist  2000 , zoccali et al .",
    "2000 ) , while an accurate modelling of the mixing mechanisms efficient in the rgb stars is necessary to correctly interpret spectroscopic observations of their surface chemical abundance patterns .    these various applications of rgb stellar models to fundamental astrophysical problems crucially rely on the ability of theory to predict correctly :     the cmd location ( in @xmath4 and color ) and extension ( in brightness ) of the rgb as a function of the initial chemical composition and age ;     the evolutionary timescales ( hence the relative numbers of stars at different luminosities ) all along the rgb ;     the rgb stars physical and chemical structure , as well as their evolution with time .",
    "the main goal of this review is to discuss the existing uncertainties in theoretical rgb models , and to assess the reliability of their predictions .    in",
    " 2 we present an outline of rgb stellar evolution , while in  3 and  4 fundamental properties of the cmd and luminosity functions of rgb models are reviewed .",
    " 5 analyzes the input physics currently used for computing rgb models , and how related uncertainties affect the outcome of the calculations ;  6 ,  7 and  8 discuss observational tests for the accuracy and adequacy of rgb models by employing cmds , spectroscopic observations , and luminosity functions .  9 reviews the use of the trgb as standard candle , and conclusions follow in  10 .",
    "stellar models are usually defined as models computed by solving the equations of stellar structure in the assumption of spherical symmetry ( e.g. kippenhahn & weigert  1991 ) , neglecting magnetic fields , rotation and mass loss from the surface , considering convection as the only efficient mixing mechanism , and assuming that the convective regions are always fully mixed , their boundaries being fixed by the schwarzschild criterion . in the rest of this paper we will use the definition for models computed including additional physical effects like , e.g. overshooting from the schwarzschild boundary of convective regions or atomic diffusion .",
    "the solution of the stellar structure equations for a given initial value of the total mass and chemical composition provides the run of physical quantities ( such as density , radius , pressure , temperature , luminosity ) as well as the chemical abundance profiles from the center up to the surface of the star , and their evolution with time . in order to compare theory with photometric observations",
    "the stellar evolution results must be then supplemented with some prescriptions to determine bolometric corrections and color indices , all along the evolutionary track .    in the following",
    "we present a summary of the rgb stellar evolution ( we refer the reader to the seminal papers by sweigart & gross  1978 and sweigart , greggio & renzini  1989 , 1990 for a detailed discussion on this subject ) .",
    "rgb stars are objects with masses lower than @xmath52.0 @xmath6 ( the precise value depends on the initial chemical composition ) , which develop electron degenerate he - cores after the end of central h - burning , surrounded by a thick h - burning shell ( thickness of the order of 0.1@xmath6 ) and a convective envelope whose chemical composition is the initial one .",
    "the envelope temperature gradient is to a large extent adiabatic , apart from the most external layers , where it becomes superadiabatic , and must be treated according to some prescribed convection theory .    at this stage ,",
    "the convective envelope progressively deepens and the h - shell narrows down to a thickness of the order of 0.001 @xmath6 , while the star crosses the cmd towards redder colors ( i.e. lower @xmath4 and larger radius ) .",
    "there is a large body of literature devoted to the identification of what is ( or what are , if more than one ) the precise physical reason for the expansion of the star to red giant dimensions ( a fact that comes out naturally from the integration of the stellar structure equations ) , but a general consensus has not been yet reached ; we address the reader to the papers by weiss  ( 1989 ) , iben  ( 1993 ) , renzini & ritossa  ( 1994 ) , sugimoto & fujimoto  ( 2000 ) , and references therein .    due to the steady deepening of the convective region",
    ", the lower boundary of the convective envelope enters regions chemically processed ( some produced he and",
    "the c and n abundances reaching their cn - cycle equilibrium value ) by the central h - burning phase ; this material is mixed almost instantaneously throughout the convective envelope , thus altering the surface abundances .",
    "this phenomenon , called first dredge - up , causes an increase of the surface he abundance , and an increase of the n / c ratio with respect to the original values .",
    "convection reaches its maximum extension ( in mass ) near the base of the rgb is basically unaffected by the inclusion of diffusion , the @xmath3 values at the trgb differ by about 0.004@xmath6 ( larger values in the case of models with diffusion ) , and the trgb surface he mass fraction is larger by @xmath50.01 in the case of canonical models ( cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ) . ] , and from this moment on the lower convective boundary slowly recedes towards the surface , due to the steady growth of the he - core which accretes he produced by the h - burning shell .",
    "the evolution along the rgb covers a relatively small range in @xmath4 ( @xmath4 slowly decreasing with time ) and a large range of surface luminosity , which increases with time .",
    "due to the growth of @xmath3 , the h - shell will encounter the sharp discontinuity of the h - profile left at the point of maximum extension of the convective envelope .",
    "the star reacts to the sudden increase of available fuel by lowering its surface luminosity and slowing down the evolutionary timescale , before starting again to increase its luminosity after the shell has moved past the discontinuity .",
    "this occurrence is recorded in both the differential luminosity function ( lf  number of stars in a given brightness interval as a function of the brightness itself ) and the integrated lf ( sum of the number of stars from an arbitrary origin to a given value of the brightness , as a function of the brightness itself ) of old stellar populations as , respectively , a local peak ( the so - called rgb bump ) in the differential lf , or a break in the slope of the integrated lf .",
    "the rgb bump is a genuine prediction of theory ( thomas  1967 , iben  1968b ) confirmed many years later by observations of the globular cluster ( gc ) 47tuc ( king , da costa & demarque 1985 ) .",
    "when @xmath3 reaches about 0.50 @xmath6 ( the precise value depends weakly on the total mass of the star , being more sensitive to the initial chemical composition ) , he - ignition occurs in the electron degenerate core , producing the so called he - flash which terminates the rgb phase by removing the electron degeneracy in the core , and drives the star onto its zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) location , that marks the start of quiescent central he - burning plus shell h - burning . as an example , fig .",
    "[ hr ] shows the evolution of a 1.0 @xmath6 ( z=0.0004 , y=0.231 ) star from the base of the rgb up to the he - flash ( salaris & weiss  1998 models ) .",
    "the rgb bump region is marked with a circle ; the rgb base and the trgb are also indicated .    due to the relatively short timescale of rgb evolution ( rgb timescales are of the order of a few percent of the main sequence lifetime )",
    ", the rgb portion of theoretical isochrones ( e.g. the cmd locus occupied by stars of different masses with the same initial chemical composition and age ) is populated by stars all with almost the same mass .",
    "this means that for rgb stars in simple stellar populations ( single age , single initial chemical composition ) , the cmd location and the expected number of stars along the red giant phase provided by an isochrone of a fixed age , are equivalent to the those given by the rgb evolutionary track of the appropriate stellar mass .",
    "stars along the rgb lose mass from their convective envelope ( e.g. , reimers  1975a , b ) , and the precise amount of mass loss along the rgb is a key parameter which determines color location and extension of the observed hb in gcs . from the point of view of the rgb evolution , however , mass loss ( in the case of the rates necessary to explain the bulk of the observed hb stars in galactic gcs , excluding the stars in the hb blue tails of some cluster , for which very extreme rates must be assumed  see , e.g. , castellani & castellani  1993 , dcruz et al .",
    "1996 ) has a negligible effect on the overall properties of rgb stars .",
    "in fact , the stars react on kelvin - helmholtz timescales to the surface mass loss , rearranging their radii according to the instantaneous value of the total mass ( e.g. castellani & castellani  1993 ) ; the stellar radius is however very weakly dependent on the value of the mass .",
    "the internal structure and evolutionary timescales are always completely unaffected by this process ; this property is due to the fact that the nuclear timescale is significantly longer than the kelvin - helmholtz timescale of the envelope thermal readjustment .",
    "a typical value for the mass lost along the rgb in galactic gcs is of the order of 0.20@xmath7 ( as inferred from the observed color distribution of stars along the hb of the bulk of gcs ) ; rgb tracks with this mass difference are almost coincident in the cmd .",
    "moreover , the mass loss appears to be also a strong function of the stellar luminosity , so that the bulk of the rgb mass loss happens only close to the trgb .",
    "a very informative summary of the available analytical mass loss formulae is presented in the appendix of catelan  ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that soker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have recently suggested the possibility that stars just starting to move off the rgb toward the zahb location may undergo a super - wind phase , analogous to that observed in asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "this occurrence could provide a physical explanation for the gap in the hb stellar distribution at @xmath8 k , observed in several galactic gcs .",
    "as previously discussed , during the rgb evolution @xmath3 increases as a consequence of the he produced by the h - burning shell ; since the core radius stays practically constant , the core density increases , and the resulting gravitational energy release raises the core temperature .",
    "in addition to this , another factor contributing to the increase of the core temperature is the steady increase with time of the temperature of the h - burning shell .",
    "the neutrino energy losses from the degenerate core also increase during the evolution .",
    "although they do not prevent a continuous growth of the core temperature , when @xmath3 is larger than @xmath9 , they are responsible for a temperature inversion in the core , so that the temperature maximum is no longer at the stellar center but at some distance from it .    due to the strong dependence of the 3@xmath10 reaction rate on temperature ,",
    "when the core gets hot enough , he - burning ignites off - center , close to the point where temperature is at its maximum . at the moment of the he - ignition in the core ,",
    "density and temperature have attained values of the order of @xmath11 g @xmath12 and @xmath13  k , respectively . in electron degeneracy conditions",
    "the gas pressure does not depend on temperature , so that an expansion does not immediately follow the local temperature increase caused by the he - burning energy release . as a consequence , at first the rate of burning , not being limited by a core expansion , becomes larger and larger and a thermal runaway ensues , the so - called he - flash ( see , e.g. , iben & renzini  1984 for a detailed discussion on the subject ) .",
    "however , during the he - flash , the temperature increase causes the degree of degeneracy to decrease , so that a core expansion can begin . at the same time , as the energy flux in the core increases significantly , convection sets in , efficiently carrying out the produced energy .",
    "these two factors contribute to moderate the strength of the flash so that the star is not necessarily destroyed ; the efficiency of the convective energy transport is especially critical ( see , e.g. , sugimoto  1964 ) .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations by achatz  ( 1995 ) and deupree  ( 1996 ) have indeed shown how the flash does not produce a hydrodynamic event .",
    "the observational evidence provided by the existence of hb stars is the best proof that the overwhelming majority of stars undergoing he - flash do not explode .",
    "another interesting question concerning the he - flash is the possibility of partial or total mixing between the he core and the envelope .",
    "a long time ago it has been recognized ( schwarzschild & hrm 1962 , 1964 , 1967 , demarque & mengel 1972 , mengel & gross 1976 , renzini & fusi pecci 1988 and references therein ) that in low - mass stars such mixing does not take place , but different conclusions have been reached in the case of metal free ( pop  iii ) or extremely metal poor stars .",
    "fujimoto , iben & hollowell  ( 1990 ) , hollowell , iben & fujimoto  ( 1990 ) and fujimoto , ikeda & iben  ( 2000 ) found that , due to the small entropy barrier between the h- and the he - rich regions , the convective zone produced by the huge energy release of he - burning during the he - flash can penetrate the overlying h - rich layers .",
    "the resulting inward migration of protons into high - temperature regions leads to a h - shell flash , which further increases the extension of the central convective region . at the late stages of this phase",
    "the convective envelope deepens , and merges with the convective zone .",
    "therefore , the initially metal free surface is enriched by a large amount of matter processed via he- and h - burning reactions , in particular a very high carbon abundance follows .",
    "a deeper insight on this phenomenon is very important , since it provides an attractive working hypothesis for explaining the peculiar chemical patterns observed in extremely metal - deficient stars .",
    "this topic has been recently addressed again by schlattl et al .",
    "( 2001 , see also weiss et al .",
    "they have investigated in detail the evolution during the he - flash phase of metal - free stars , covering a larger parameter space with respect to the works by fujimoto and coworkers .",
    "schlattl et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have confirmed earlier results pointing out that the crucial parameter which defines whether the he - flash induced mixing occurs , is the location of the point where the he - burning energy release is maximum .",
    "the deeper inside the star this point lies , the lower is the probability that the convective zone developing at the he - flash ignition can penetrate into the hydrogen - rich envelope , thereby carrying down protons and triggering a h - burning runaway .",
    "however , even if the development of the process and its global properties are in fine agreement with the outcomes obtained by previous investigations , there is a fundamental difference : whereas fujimoto et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and fujimoto et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim that the h - flash is a common property of all low - mass ( @xmath14 ) metal - deficient stars , schlattl et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found that the occurrence of a h - flash critically depends on the adopted initial conditions , like stellar mass and he abundance , as well as on the inclusion and/or assumptions made for the treatment of additional physical processes like atomic diffusion and external pollution of metals during the main sequence phase .",
    "a preliminary comparison with some extremely metal - poor stars , such as cs22892 - 052 and cs22957 - 027 ( see schlattl et al .  2001 for details ) , revealed a good match of effective temperature , luminosity and the relative abundances of carbon and nitrogen , but too large absolute abundances of these elements . even if the h - flash phenomenon provides an interesting working scenario for interpreting the observed abundance patterns in extremely metal - deficient stars , it is not yet able to provide a detailed match to the observations . whether this occurrence is a proof of the fact that the peculiar chemical abundances observed in extremely metal - poor stars may be primordial ( hence these objects are not low mass pop  iii stars ) , due to external pollution at a late evolutionary stage , or a signature of drawbacks in current theoretical models for the he - flash phase in metal - free rgb stars , is not yet clear .",
    "the behavior of rgb models in the observational cmd follows closely their properties in the theoretical luminosity-@xmath4 diagram .",
    "we have considered , as an example , the @xmath15 ( johnson - cousins ) plane , and used the theoretical isochrones by salaris & weiss  ( 1998 ) transformed into the @xmath15 plane according to the alonso , arribas & martinez - roger  ( 1999 ) empirical color transformations magnitudes in the johnson band .",
    "the transformation to the cousins system has been performed following the prescriptions by fernie  ( 1983 ) . ] .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd1 ] shows the location in the @xmath16 plane of rgb isochrones of different ages and the same initial metal content , while the upper panel displays isochrones of the same age and different initial metallicities .",
    "it is evident that the rgb color at a given absolute brightness ( hence the stellar @xmath4 ) is very weakly affected by the age of the parent population ( hence by the value of the stellar mass ) , at least for ages higher than a few gyr . on the other hand ,",
    "it is strongly affected by the initial value of the metallicity z ( metals mass fraction ) .",
    "more metal rich rgb models are redder ( see upper panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd1 ] ) .",
    "this property is , from the qualitative point of view , absolutely general and does not depend on the specific color bands used , since it mirrors the behavior of the models in the luminosity-@xmath4 plane .",
    "however , the precise value of the sensitivity of rgb colors to z does depend on the wavelength bands employed in the cmd . not only the color , but also the shape of the rgb is affected by z , in a way which is strongly dependent on the wavelength bands used .",
    "this is clearly visible in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd1 ] , when the isochrones are plotted in the @xmath17 plane ( dashed lines ) . in this plane the shape of the rgb is more dramatically affected , due to the behavior of the bolometric correction to the @xmath18 band as a function of metallicity . the shape and location of rgb models is almost unaffected by the selected he mass fraction y , but it is sensitive to the metal distribution . in particular , as discussed by salaris , chieffi & straniero  ( 1993  see also salaris & cassisi  1996 , salaris & weiss  1998 , vandenberg et al .",
    "2000 ) , the abundance of low ionization potential elements like mg , si , s , ca and fe affects strongly the rgb temperature . in general , for typical pop  ii low mass stars , rgb models computed with an arbitrary heavy element mixture will be equivalent to models with scaled solar metal ratios of the same total metallicity , as long as the ratio @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath21 ) in the selected metal mixture is the same as in the scaled solar one .",
    "since what is measured spectroscopically is [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath10/fe ] , it is useful to consider the following relationship ( salaris et al .",
    "1993 ) linking an input parameter of theoretical models like [ m / h ] ( [ m / h]@xmath5log(z/@xmath22 ) ) to [ fe / h ] and @xmath23}$ ] , which holds in case of the scaled solar metal mixture by ross - aller  ( 1976 ) :    @xmath24\\sim \\rm [ fe / h]+\\rm log(0.638 \\sl f_{\\alpha}+ \\rm 0.362)\\ ] ]    small adjustments to the coefficients must be applied in case of more recent determinations of the solar metal distributions ; yi et al .  ( 2001 ) have obtained , in case of the grevesse & noels  ( 1993 ) solar metal distribution :    @xmath24\\sim \\rm [ fe / h]+\\rm log(0.694 \\sl f_{\\alpha}+ \\rm 0.306)\\ ] ]    as far as the rgb location is concerned , this equivalence between scaled solar and @xmath10-enhanced models with the same total metallicity breaks down when z is greater than @xmath50.002 ( [ m / h]@xmath251 ) . in case of",
    "the trgb and rgb bump luminosities , and the subsequent zahb luminosity , the previously discussed agreement between scaled solar and @xmath10-enhanced models with the same total metallicity holds for z up to @xmath50.01 .    as for the trgb brightness ,",
    "this is weakly dependent on the stellar mass ( fig .",
    "[ cmd1 ] ) , and therefore on the isochrone age , for ages larger than @xmath54 - 5 gyr .",
    "this is due to the fact that , at a given initial chemical composition , the trgb level ( and in general the stellar surface luminosity all along the rgb ) is determined by the value of @xmath3 , and its value at the he - flash is fairly constant over large part of the low - mass star range .",
    "@xmath3 decreases for increasing metallicity , while the trgb brightness increases due to the increased efficiency of the h - shell , which compensates for the reduced core mass .",
    "the brightness of the subsequent zahb phase follows the behaviour of @xmath3 , decreasing for increasing metallicity .",
    "@xmath26 appears to be also very weakly sensitive to the heavy element abundance ( e.g. , lfm93 , salaris & cassisi  1997 ) ; for [ m / h ] ranging between @xmath272.0 and @xmath270.6 , @xmath26 changes by less than 0.1 mag .",
    "in fact , @xmath28 is proportional / fe ] ratios approximately constant with respect to [ fe / h ] . ] to @xmath290.18[m / h ] , while @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath31 ( e.g. , da costa & armandroff  1990 ) .",
    "since the color of the trgb goes approximately as 0.57[m / h ] , then @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath290.14[m / h ] .",
    "the slope of the @xmath32[m / h ] relationship is therefore very similar to the slope of the @xmath33[m / h ] relationship , and since @xmath26=@xmath34 , @xmath26 is almost independent of the stellar metal content .",
    "this is the basis for its use as distance indicator . on the other hand , due",
    "again to the behaviour of the bolometric corrections to the @xmath18 band , @xmath35 is strongly affected by the metal content of the stars .",
    "we have already defined the differential lf ( or , simply , the lf ) of rgb tracks ( or isochrones ) as the run of the number of stars per brightness bin along the rgb , as a function of the brightness itself .",
    "the number of objects in a given bin is of course determined by the local evolutionary speed , so that the comparison of observed and theoretical rgb lfs provides a key test for the accuracy of the predicted rgb timescales .    in fig .",
    "[ lf1 ] ( upper panel ) two v band rgb lfs ( bin size of 0.1 mag ) , for isochrones of 13 gyr and z=0.0004 ( dashed line ) and z=0.008 ( solid line ) are shown ; they are normalized to the same number of stars between @xmath36=2.0 and 3.0 .",
    "the local maxima located at @xmath370.2 and 1.0 correspond to the rgb bump ; the increase of the number of stars close to the trgb of the more metal rich lf is due to the fact that the v magnitude of the rgb models at this metallicity tends to stay constant or increase slightly toward the trgb ( see fig .  [ cmd1 ] ) .",
    "the overall linearity of the lf is a straightforward consequence of the existence of a luminosity - @xmath3 relation ( see eggleton 1968 and castellani , chieffi & norci 1989 for a detailed discussion about this point ) .",
    "it is evident that the ratio of the evolutionary timescales along the rgb does not depend on z , since the slope of the lfs ( i.e. the luminosity - @xmath3 relation ) are almost coincident .    in the lower panel of the same figure",
    "the effect of age ( value of the evolving mass ) is shown for two lfs with z=0.008 and ages of , respectively , 10 ( dotted line ) and 13 ( solid line ) gyr .",
    "the lf ( like the cmd location ) is basically unaffected by the age and only the position of the bump is slightly changed .",
    "we address the reader to the paper by vandenberg , larson & de propris  ( 1998 ) for a more detailed discussion about the dependence of the lf on various physical and chemical inputs .",
    "the quality of the agreement between observations and theory is affected by both the adequacy of the assumptions built into the stellar models , and the accuracy of the description of the physical processes accounted for . in the following ,",
    "we discuss in some detail the input physics used in the current generations of rgb models , highlighting the influence on rgb stellar properties of the various choices made by different authors .",
    "whenever the energy is transported by radiative processes a knowledge of the radiative opacity of the stellar matter is required in order to determine the temperature gradient . within the star , where the diffusion approximation is applied to the energy transfer equation , the rosseland mean",
    "opacity is required .",
    "we define here as low - temperature ( low-@xmath38 ) opacities , rosseland mean values when @xmath39 k , and high - temperature ( high-@xmath38 ) opacities the values at larger temperatures . as discussed by salaris et al  ( 1993 ) , it is the low-@xmath38 opacities which mainly determine the @xmath4 location of theoretical rgb models , while the high-@xmath38 ones enter in the determination of the mass extension of the convective envelope ( through the value of the radiative temperature gradient ) .",
    "current generations of stellar models employ mainly the low-@xmath38 opacity calculations by alexander & ferguson  ( 1994 )  and in some cases the kurucz  ( 1992 ) ones  which constitute the most up - to - date computations suitable for stellar modelling , spanning a large range of initial chemical compositions .",
    "the main difference between these two sets of data is the treatment of molecular absorption , most notably the fact that alexander & ferguson  ( 1994 ) include the effect of the @xmath40 molecule .",
    "salaris & cassisi  ( 1996 ) have compared , at different initial metallicities , stellar models produced with these two sets of opacities ( as well as with the less used neuforge  1993 ones , which provide results almost undistinguishable from models computed with kurucz  1992 data ) , showing that a very good agreement exists when @xmath4 is larger than @xmath54000 k. as soon as the rgb @xmath4 goes below this limit ( when the models approach the trgb and/or their initial metallicity is increased ) , alexander & ferguson  ( 1994 ) opacities produce progressively cooler models ( differences reaching values of the order of 100 k or more ) , due to the effect of the @xmath40 molecule which contributes substantially to the opacity in this temperature range .    as for the high-@xmath38 radiative opacities , the opal results ( e.g. iglesias & rogers  1996 )",
    "are generally used ; these opacities , coupled with the opal equation of state ( rogers , swenson & iglesias  1996 ) , have been repeatedly tested against helioseismological constraints ( e.g. , deglinnocenti et al .",
    "1997 ) , providing a good agreement between theory and observations , at least in the solar regime .      in the electron",
    "degenerate he - core an evaluation of the electron conduction ( or , briefly , conductive ) opacity is needed in order to determine the local temperature gradient .",
    "the precise computation of the conductive opacities is fundamental for deriving the correct value of the he - core mass at the he - flash , since , for example , higher conductive opacities cause a less efficient cooling of the he - core and an earlier he - ignition ( i.e. , at a lower core mass ) .",
    "two main choices are presently available , neither of which is totally satisfactory : the analytical fitting formulae by itoh et al .",
    "( 1983  i83 ) , or the old hubbard & lampe ( 1969  hl69 ) tabulation . as pointed out by catelan , de freitas pacheco & horvath  ( 1996 ) , the most recent results by i83 are an improvement over the older hl69 ones , but their range of validity does not cover the he - cores of rgb stars .",
    "the i83 opacities are generally smaller than those obtained from the hl69 tables , thus implying larger values of @xmath3 at the he - flash .",
    "castellani & deglinnocenti  ( 1999 ) find an increase by 0.005@xmath6 of @xmath3 core at the he - flash for a 0.8@xmath6 model with initial metallicity z=0.0002 , while in case of a 1.5@xmath6 star with solar chemical composition the increase amounts to 0.008@xmath6 ( castellani et al .",

    "therefore , at least for the evaluation of @xmath4 , the mlt is basically a one - parameter theory .",

    "it is clear that , by using the mlt , even if the input physics employed in the model computation is not accurate , it is possible to mask this shortcoming  at least from the point of view of the predicted @xmath4  by simply recalibrating @xmath50 on the sun .",
    "this guarantees that the models always predict correctly the @xmath4 of at least solar type stars .",
    "however , since the rgb location is much more sensitive to the value of @xmath50 than the main sequence , it is important to be sure that a solar depends not only on the adopted input physics , but also , as previously discussed , on the selected mlt formalism . for these reasons , to allow a comparison of the results by different authors , the adopted mlt formalism has to be specified in addition to the input physics and boundary conditions employed . ]",
    "@xmath50 is always suitable also for rgb stars of various metallicities .",

    "an independent way of calibrating @xmath50 for rgb stars is to compare empirically determined rgb @xmath4 values for galactic gcs with theoretical models of the appropriate chemical composition ( see also salaris & cassisi  1996 , vandenberg , stetson & bolte  1996 and references therein ) . in fig .",

    "this means that  for a fixed rgb temperature scale  the calibration of @xmath50 on the empirical @xmath4 values would not provide always the solar value .",

    "[ ttau ]  but clearly points out the fact that one can not expect the same rgb @xmath4 from solar calibrated models not employing exactly the same input physics .",
    "the logical conclusion is that it is always necessary to compare rgb models with observations to ensure the proper calibration of @xmath50 for rgb stars .    before concluding this section",

    "it is interesting to notice that , at least at this metallicity , the fst model is located within the temperature range spanned by the various solar calibrated @xmath50 tracks .",
    "since there are basically no adjustable parameters in the fst formalism , any mismatch between predicted and observed temperatures for rgbs in gcs could still be due to systematic errors in the adopted @xmath4 and metallicity scale , and/or to inaccuracies of other aspects of the input physics , which , in case of the mlt , can be masked by a suitable calibration of @xmath50 .",

    "empirical results for rgb stars are also provided by montegriffo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and von braun et al .",
    "a severe limitation of this approach is that the range of chemical compositions and evolutionary phases covered by these transformations is strongly constrained by the evolutionary stage and chemical composition of the calibrating stars .    due to the arbitrary zero - point of the @xmath52 scale ( e.g. , castelli  1999 ) , when computing @xmath18 magnitudes from the values of the bolometric luminosity provided by the evolutionary tracks , and @xmath52 given by the selected sets of transformations , one has first to adjust the bolometric magnitude of the sun in order to reproduce the solar visual luminosity ( @xmath54=4.82@xmath450.02 , hayes  1985 ) with the provided solar @xmath52 ( see , e.g. , the discussion by castelli  1999 ) .",
    "an equivalent possibility is to fix the value of the bolometric magnitude of the sun and adjust the zero point of the @xmath52 scale in order to reproduce @xmath55 . with this calibration of the solar bolometric magnitude ( or of the @xmath52 zero point )",

    "it is also worth remembering that the zero point of the color indices predicted by model atmospheres computations is usually set by reproducing the colors of vega ( e.g. castelli  1999 ) .",
    "after properly calibrating the zero point of the @xmath52 scale , one finds that the various available sets of transformations , when applied to a given set of stellar models , provide @xmath36 values within @xmath50.05 mag ( see also weiss & salaris  1999 ) . along the rgb",

    "standard rgb models predict a modest change in elements participating in proton - capture nucleosynthesis (   2.1 ) .",
    "since the depth of convective mixing extends to layers with @xmath66  k at most , only helium , lithium , carbon and nitrogen and their isotopes are concerned . in particular",
    ", the @xmath67 ratio is predicted to drop from the initial cosmic value of 90 to about 25 , but not to that of cn - equilibrium , which is of order 3 .",
    "these variations are predicted to take place near the base of the rgb in low- and intermediate mass stars , and agree with observations .    this canonical picture about rgb abundances , however ,",
    "is challenged by an increasing amount of observational data demonstrating its limited validity . in the following",
    ", we will summarize this observational material and discuss possible theoretical explanations . in the context of this review , these observations clearly demonstrate that the physical processes taken into account in canonical stellar evolution calculations are insufficient and that the theory needs to be extended .",
    "the reader may find additional material in the excellent reviews by kraft  ( 1994 ) and da costa  ( 1998 ) , although the amount of observations has grown a lot since their publication .",
    "there is now large evidence for mixing beyond the canonical first dredge - up prediction in metal - poor field stars .",
    "charbonnel & do nascimento  ( 1998 ) summarized the literature data to find that in 95% of the low - mass metal - poor field stars the @xmath67 ratio is lower than expected .",
    "the average value is of order 10 , but a few stars also reach @xmath68 .",
    "charbonnel & do nascimento  ( 1998 ) identify two interesting trends : firstly , there is a clear anti - correlation between isotope ratio and brightness , setting in at @xmath69 , i.e.  approximately at the level of the rgb bump , and secondly , the lowest @xmath67 values are reached by those stars showing the highest surface rotation , @xmath70 .",
    "the first fact provides substantial evidence that the isotope anomaly is due to intrinsic extra - mixing beyond the established first dredge - up during rgb evolution ; the second one hints that there is a correlation with rotation , which might possibly initiate this additional mixing .",
    "gratton et al .  ( 2000 ) confirmed these results by a dedicated abundance analysis of 62 low - mass metal - poor field stars with hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "they confirmed the trends found earlier and added additional details .",
    "they conclude that a second mixing episode sets in after the bump , resulting in lowered carbon abundances and carbon isotope ratios ( but `` distinctly higher than the equilibrium value '' ) , an increased nitrogen and a declining li abundance down to almost zero .",
    "they confirm that this happens in basically all stars of their own sample and 43 additional stars from the literature .",
    "the anticorrelation with brightness is evident , too .",
    "another very important result is that neither o nor na show any abundance variation in these field stars .",
    "this is , as we shall see below , quite different from similar stars in globular clusters .",
    "most recently , keller , pilachowski & sneden  ( 2001 ) confirmed the carbon isotope results from ir - data . from a sample of literature data",
    "they also find that the amount of mixing seems to decline with increasing metallicity .",
    "the quantity and quality of observations and the rate of new data acquisition is impressive . in the following ,",
    "only a few highlights illustrating the main trends can be mentioned . for more extended references to observational material",
    "the reader should consult the current literature .",
    "carbon abundance variations along gc rgbs have been detected as early as 1979 in m92 ( bell , dickens & gustafsson  1979 ) , the cluster which remains to be one of the most important cases displaying evolutionary effects ( carbon et al .",
    "1982 , langer et al .",
    "1986 , bellman et al .",
    "the variations are in agreement with those in field stars , i.e.  a declining carbon abundance and isotope ratio , and an increasing nitrogen abundance with brightness .",
    "similar cases include m15 ( trefzger et al .  1983 ) ,",
    "ngc  6397 ( briley et al .",
    "in addition , star - to - star variations in o and na were detected in a significant number of clusters , most prominently in ngc  6752 ( suntzeff & smith  1991 ) , ngc  3201 ( gonzalez & wallerstein  1998 ) , m3 ( suntzeff  1981 ) and m13 ( suntzeff  1981 , pilachowski et al .",
    "1996 ) , the latter cluster exhibiting the most extreme spread in abundances .",
    "@xmath65  cen ( norris & da costa  1995 ) , the only cluster with a clear intra - cluster iron abundance ( or total metallicity ) spread , also displays the full spectrum of anomalies .",
    "oxygen tends to be underabundant by up to 0.5 to 1.0  dex with respect to the standard , @xmath10-enhanced metal composition ( [ o / fe]@xmath71 ) , while sodium is overabundant up to more than 0.5  dex .",
    "the important point is that the two elements are anticorrelated in their abundance variations .",
    "there is  in contrast to the cno - elements  no clear evidence for a development of the anomalies along the rgb , although in m13 they seem to be absent below the bump , but fully developed above it .",
    "most importantly , and as mentioned above , the o - na - anticorrelation or any other anomaly in their abundances is definitely absent in field stars ( gratton et al .",
    "this points to the influence of some environmental effect .",
    "many of the best observations have been obtained with the keck / hires instrument , although smaller telescopes are sufficient for spectroscopy of the brightest stars . since the year 2000 , the vlt / uves instrument has become available , allowing the observations of cluster stars at the subgiant branch ( sgb ) or to .",
    "first results have been published already by castilho et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and gratton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) about ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 .",
    "while for the first cluster the comparison between to- and sgb - stars shows no significant abundance differences and a very low scatter in oxygen , ngc  6752 already displays the full range of the o - na - anticorrelation close to the main sequence .",
    "these observations provide strong evidence for a non - evolutionary source for the abundance anomalies , as do the results by king et al .",
    "( 1998 ) about m92 , in which the corresponding na and mg ( see below ) anomalies are claimed to be found in subgiants , too .",
    "more metal - rich clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath72 ) support this : in a number of clusters ( 47  tuc , cannon et al .  1998 ; m4 , ivans et al .  1999 ; m71 , briley & cohen  2001 ) a bimodal c - n abundance distribution is present all along the cluster sequence , or  as in m5 ( ivans et al .",
    "2001 )  the extent of the anomaly may even be anti - correlated with evolutionary state .",
    "all these facts are interpreted in terms of the presence of a primordial source such as contamination by more massive stars .    the final point in favor of a primordial component responsible for at least some abundance variations",
    "is the fact that also a mg - al - anticorrelation has been found in several clusters ( among them @xmath65  cen , norris & da costa  1995 ; m13 , shetrone  1996a ; m4 , ivans et al .",
    "1999 ) , where al can be overabundant by up to 1  dex .",
    "as will be discussed below , the conversion of @xmath73 mg to @xmath74al is possible only in stars more evolved than the rgb , since temperatures of @xmath75k are needed ( langer , hoffman & zaidins  1997 ) .",
    "al - production from other mg - isotopes fails to explain the high al - enrichment and leads to conflicts with the na - abundance trends .",
    "the high al abundances found in cluster stars are probably the most difficult anomaly to be explained .",
    "the result of the standard first dredge - up , taking place on the sgb and lower rgb is to transport material that has participated in hydrogen - burning into the convective envelope , mixing it there with matter of the initial composition .",
    "the observed abundances of cno - elements are in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions , and in particular show the constancy of the sum of c , n , and o , the proper correlations , and isotope ratios .",
    "they can be explained , thus , by mixing of proton - capture nucleosynthesis products .",
    "in addition to the well - known cno - cycle , analogous reaction cycles involving heavier elements exist at higher temperature . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we show the nena- and mgal - cycles and in fig .  [ f2 ] the abundance profiles in and above the hydrogen - burning shell of a typical rgb cluster star .",
    "it is obvious that abundance variations due to first proton - capture reactions , such as the c@xmath76n conversion appear outside the region of a significantly reduced h - abundance and thus of a varying molecular weight .",
    "the elements affected ( c , n , o , ne , na , mg , al ) are exactly those which show star - to - star variations in clusters , providing the first evidence that the anomalies are the result of proton - capture reactions .",
    "denissenkov & denissenkova  ( 1990 ) demonstrated that the o - na - anticorrelation can be explained self - consistently by the assumption that both elements have been subject to nuclear processing in a typical rgb hydrogen - shell .",
    "the crucial point is that na and o are not participating in the same cycle ( as is the case for the c - n - anticorrelation ) , but in the nena- and cno - cycle , respectively .",
    "however , within the shell oxygen is depleted and sodium enhanced at the same location , and hence temperature ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ; the first rise at @xmath77 of the model shown ) . note that in the outermost layers of this region na is enhanced without significant depletion of o ; such cases are observed , too .",
    "unfortunately , the accompanying ne - depletion can not be detected .",
    "langer , hoffman & sneden  ( 1993 ) and others confirmed that a typical rgb h - shell could be the source for the anomalies up to na , and since then the observations are being explained in terms of proton - capture nucleosynthesis .",
    "the most up - to - date reaction rates as well as a discussion of their errors can be found in arnould , goriely & jorissen  ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is of special interest that the stable aluminium isotope @xmath78 is produced only in the very deep interior of the h - shell and at the expense of @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , where the initial magnesium abundance was raised to @xmath80}=1.2 $ ] ; see below ) .",
    "langer & hoffman  ( 1995 ) investigated in detail the nucleosynthesis of na , al and mg .",
    "their results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) under rgb - typical conditions al is produced almost exclusively at the expense of @xmath79 ; for isotope and element ratios typical of field halo stars this results in only a modest al enrichment of @xmath81  dex ; ( ii ) to reach the high [ al / fe]-levels observed , @xmath80 } \\gtrsim 1.0 $ ] has to be assumed ; ( iii ) the conversion of @xmath79 into @xmath78 leads to a depletion of only 0.2  dex in mg ; ( iv ) significant al - production happens only at very high temperatures ; as a consequence , helium - enriched material is mixed into the envelope .",
    "the second of these points requires an additional primordial component and the first one is in contradiction with the fact that it is @xmath82 , which is depleted in m13 ( shetrone  1996b , but see ivans et al .",
    "1999 for a different result on m4 ) . and finally , the depletion of mg in m13 is as large as 0.4  dex , which can be reconciled with ( iii ) only with difficulties .",
    "a further complication arises from the fact that nucleosynthesis calculations show that na has a higher overproduction than al ( langer et al .",
    "1993 ) , while observations ( norris & da costa  1995 ) indicate the opposite .",
    "langer et al .  ( 1997 ) showed that a better agreement with all element abundances can be reached if the burning temperature of the hydrogen shell is assumed to be around @xmath83  k , more typical for asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . in rgb stars ,",
    "@xmath84  k is the maximum value reached by very metal - poor stars close to trgb , while al is overabundant at much lower brightness as well .        the very clear evidence from field stars (   [ dm : field ] ) and cn - variations in some clusters (   [ dm : cluster ] ) requires that at least part of the complete explanation for all the anomalies discussed is to be found in a non - canonical effect taking place during the rgb - phase , due to which the products of nucleosynthesis in the red giant s own h - burning shell appear at the surface .",
    "this requires some additional mixing between shell and the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "the mixing must be rather slow , otherwise the trends with luminosity would not be observed and the whole envelope could probably be processed by the shell .",
    "most of the observations supporting this evolutionary scenario indicate that the extra mixing sets in at or after the bump , i.e.  the point at which there is an almost vanishing difference in molecular weight between the outer shell regions ( @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) and the convective envelope .",
    "however , in m92 the carbon depletion might start even earlier than that ( see bellman et al .  2001 ) .    evolutionary models , pioneered by sweigart & mengel  ( 1979 ) , therefore try to reproduce the observations by adding proton - capture nucleosynthesis in the nena- and mgal - cycles and some kind of extra - mixing to the canonical stellar evolution calculations .",
    "different implementations ranging from  approaches ( wasserburg , boothroyd & sackmann  1995 ) to models fully incorporating diffusive mixing ( charbonnel  1995 , weiss , denissenkov & charbonnel  2000b ) exist , but none is  up to the present time  completely self - consistent , in the sense that the physical reason for the mixing ( probably differential rotation ) , its extent and speed , the full nucleosynthesis , and the back - reaction on the model are solved simultaneously . in the following",
    "we will describe a two - stage approach used by denissenkov & weiss ( denissenkov & weiss  1996 , and later work ) and  in a slightly variant form  by cavallo , sweigart & bell  ( 1998 , and follow - up work ) .",
    "this method separates the canonical from the non - canonical aspects of the problem . a stellar model of appropriate mass ( typically @xmath86 ) and composition",
    "is evolved within the canonical framework along the rgb .",
    "several models at various epochs are then used for the background structure ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) on which the extra - mixing and detailed nucleosynthesis are performed .",
    "the background structure of the region between shell and convective envelope can be obtained for any given timestep by interpolation in the relative coordinate @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the relative mass coordinates of the bottom of shell and convective zone , respectively ( denissenkov & weiss  1996 ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis then is calculated with this background physical structure , by using an extensive network of up to 26 nuclei and 69 reactions ( denissenkov et al .",
    "the mixing is done by solving a diffusion equation with diffusive speed ( the diffusion constant ) and penetration depth as free parameters .",
    "both are identical for all elements .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that it allows the calculation of a range of extra - mixing parameters and an economical exploration of stellar metallicity ( cavallo et al .",
    "the disadvantage is that it has to assume that the mixing has no influence on the background structure evolution , i.e.  that there is no significant back - reaction .",
    "obviously , the approach is always inconsistent as the mixing of the various metals has not been taken into account in the stellar model calculations .",
    "as long as no change in the h / he - profile takes place and thus the mixing does not touch regions of declining hydrogen abundance in the shell ( @xmath94 ) , the hope is that the inconsistency does not pose a severe problem .",
    "however , it also implies that no very deep mixing can be investigated .",
    "all results confirm that cn- and ona - abundance anomalies can be reproduced by the deep - mixing scenario with reasonable mixing assumptions ( e.g. , langer et al .",
    "1993 , charbonnel  1995 , denissenkov & weiss  1996 , cavallo et al .",
    "1998 , denissenkov & tout  2001 ) . in a number of papers ,",
    "these assumptions are based on a physical model for rotation - induced mixing .",
    "for example , the results by denissenkov & tout  ( 2001 ) , repeated in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , were obtained this way . due to the physical approach",
    "the derived effective diffusion constant varies with depth , and is of order @xmath95 .",
    "the diffusive speed drops toward zero at @xmath96 ; this point corresponds to the mixing depth used in denissenkov & weiss  ( 1996 ) and weiss et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with the parameters used in the two papers quoted .",
    "the penetration depths are actually shallow enough to justify the two - stage approach . figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] illustrate the successful reproduction of observed anomalies in several clusters .    as a ( rather important ) side - effect , the additional mixing also ensures that most of @xmath97 produced in the pp - i - chain on the main - sequence is destroyed , thereby resolving one of the problems of galactic chemical evolution  that of @xmath97-overproduction ( see charbonnel & do nascimento  1998 , weiss et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the calculations based on rotation - induced mixing ( charbonnel  1995 , denissenkov & tout  2001 ) also predict that the mixing is not able to penetrate significant molecular weight changes ( charbonnel , brown & wallerstein  1998 ) , supporting the picture that the evolutionary effects can start only at or after the bump and that no significant amounts of helium will be mixed to the surface .",
    "the same models predict that no additional mixing takes place in stars of @xmath98 and that the degree of extra - mixing diminishes with increasing metallicity ( cavallo et al .",
    "this is in agreement with observations ( e.g. gilroy  1989 and briley , smith & claver  2001 ) .",
    "in contrast to this , sweigart(1997a , b ) , argued for a penetration of the molecular weight barrier and resulting helium mixing accompanying extreme o - na - anomalies such as those found in m13 .",
    "such  would have significant bearing for both the evolution along the rgb , the brightness of the trgb , the hb brightness level and the hb morphology .",
    "some of these predictions will be discussed further in   8 and   9.1 .",
    "weiss et al .  ( 2000b ) investigated the consequences on the proton - capture element abundances with models in which the helium mixing itself was included into the full stellar evolution calculations ( to account for the structural changes ) and concluded that noticeable helium mixing would be accompanied by extreme o and na changes ( resulting from the second na rise in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) exceeding the observed levels . therefore , based purely on nucleosynthesis arguments ,",
    "the mixing of regions with @xmath99 could be excluded ; on the other hand , weiss et al .  ( 2000b ) also found models which evolved to very high luminosities without strong helium mixing into the envelope and without violating the abundance observations .",
    "however , these were preliminary results to be investigated further with more physical mixing models .    the  models all fail to explain the mg - al anticorrelation , because of the temperatures in the shell regions affected by the deep mixing being too low for al production from @xmath82 .",
    "fujimoto , aikawa & kato  ( 1999 ) , and aikawa , fujimoto & kato  ( 2001 ) proposed a variant of the deep mixing scenario , where the mixing repeatedly penetrates the whole h - shell , mixing protons into the hot helium - core , leading to shell flashes , in which also al is synthesized .",
    "this scenario is in fact very similar to the helium - flash in pop  iii stars discussed in   2.3 .",
    "while this model succeeds in reproducing several abundance trends , which remain unexplained in the simple deep - mixing scenario , the models are simple box - models ( i.e.  no complete stellar models ) so far , and a physical explanation for these extreme mixing events is even more difficult .",
    "concerning the al problem , langer & hoffman  ( 1995 ) noted that significant amounts of the radioactively unstable isotope @xmath100 ( lifetime : @xmath101  years ) can be produced in the same shell regions which are responsible for the o - na - anticorrelation .",
    "denissenkov & weiss  ( 2001 ) investigated this in detail with the two - stage method and demonstrated that under the assumption that the observed al is actually @xmath100 , all known correlations in @xmath65  cen and m4 ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) can be simultaneously explained with standard mixing parameters .",
    "in fact , the mixing speed is high enough as compared to the isotope s lifetime that enough @xmath100 is always transported to the surface , replacing the decayed atoms .",
    "if the al could be confirmed as @xmath100 , either by isotopic line shifts or the emitted 1.8  mev @xmath102-line ( both not being possible as yet ) , this would be a direct proof for the on - going mixing process . as mentioned earlier",
    ", these models also needed a primordial enrichment of @xmath79 by a factor 10 .      as was shown in ",
    "[ dm : cluster ] and   [ dm : proton ] there are a number of arguments in favor of a primordial component : these are the failure to produce the large al - overabundances in standard rgb h - shells consistently with the mg and na data , and the finding of anomalies in a number of cluster stars already on the sgb , or even earlier . also , ivans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue that in m4 there exists a `` primordial floor '' of abundance anomalies ( notably in al ) , on which an evolutionary component is superimposed .",
    "most papers employing primordial components turn to agb - stars of higher mass , in which proton - nucleosynthesis takes place at higher temperatures .",

    "( 1998 ) and ventura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; the latter is focused on the so - called hot - bottom burning phase .",
    "this approach explains in particular the high al and low mg ( probably @xmath82 ) observed in two subgiants in ngc  6752 ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) . since in the primordial picture",
    "the nucleosynthesis and mass loss takes place in more advanced stages of evolution , we will not go into the details here .",
    "the existence of star - to - star variations in the abundances of proton - capture elements has been demonstrated without doubt .",
    "in fact , it appears as if they are a generic property of all low - mass ( @xmath103 ) metal - poor stars , as long as they are restricted to cno - elements .",
    "the same data strongly point to an intrinsic evolutionary process in red giants , which still has to be fully understood and incorporated into self - consistent models .",
    "only cluster stars seem to exhibit the anomalies in heavier elements ( na , o , mg , al ) as well .",
    "it is not yet clear , whether an evolutionary component is necessary to explain those , but a primordial one seems unavoidable .",
    "this will lead to interesting consequences for the intra - cluster gas chemical evolution .",
    "although some reactions in the nena- and mgal - cycles are still uncertain , this general picture will not depend on them .",
    "however , nuclear data would be of great help to narrow the range of conditions for proton - capture nucleosynthesis . and",
    "finally , abundance data as a function of luminosity along cluster sequences are necessary from the to to the trgb in order to investigate the contributions of primordial and evolutionary components .    before concluding this section",
    ", we notice that , as long as one tries to explain by deep mixing only the cno and nena - cycle anomalies , and therefore no appreciable amount of hydrogen is brought into the shell ( and helium dredged into the envelope ) , the evolutionary timescales and rgb location predicted by canonical models are not affected by this added element transport mechanism ( see , e.g. , weiss et al .",
    "2000b and discussion in  8) .",
    "the analysis of the rgb lf is of paramount importance in order to check the accuracy of the inner structure of theoretical rgb models . in particular , as discussed by renzini & fusi - pecci  ( 1988 ) , through the lf one can test the chemical stratification inside the star .",
    "this follows from the fact that the hydrogen abundance sampled by the thin h - burning shell strongly affects the rate of evolution , hence the star counts along the rgb .",
    "when a statistically sizeable sample of rgb stars is available , one could expect to check the envelope chemical profile with a mass resolution of the same order of magnitude of the shell thickness .",
    "moreover , the lf is unaffected by the existing uncertainties in the @xmath4 and color determination .",
    "langer , bolte & sandquist  ( 2000 ) have recently claimed the existence of a discrepancy between the theoretical and observed rgb lf of the two gcs , m5 and m30 ( see also vandenberg et al .",
    "they found an overabundance on stars in the upper rgb , arguing that the cause might be the action of some very deep mixing mechanism active during the rgb ascent .",
    "this deep mixing ( see  7 for a more detailed discussion about this point ) would be able to bring some hydrogen from the envelope into the h - burning shell ( and therefore an extra amount of he in the envelope ) , causing a longer lifetime and an increase of the number of observed rgb stars .",
    "a recent analysis by zoccali & piotto  ( 2000 ) has found however a good general agreement between various sets of theoretical lfs and observations of a large sample of gcs  some of which show the abundance anomalies discussed in  7  , at least below [ fe / h]@xmath1040.7 .",
    "possible discrepancies at higher metallicity , in the upper part of the rgb , need to be confirmed with further observational data . the lf slope predicted by theoretical models and its independence of the initial stellar metallicity looks therefore confirmed , supporting the relative timescale along the rgb predicted by canonical models , and showing that deep mixing , if effective , does not appreciably affect the predictions of canonical rgb models .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by rood et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in their study of the lf of m3 .",
    "as already mentioned , during the rgb evolution the h - burning shell crosses the chemical discontinuity left over by the convective envelope soon after the first dredge - up .",
    "when the shell encounters this discontinuity , matter in the shell expands and cools slightly , causing a sharp drop in the stellar surface luminosity . after a while , thermal equilibrium",
    "is achieved again and the stellar luminosity starts to monotonically increase up to the trgb . as a consequence ,",
    "the structure passes three times across a narrow magnitude interval .",
    "this occurrence produces the characteristic bump in the theoretical lf .    since its detection in 47tuc ,",
    "the rgb bump has become the crossroad of several theoretical and observational investigations ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1990 , alves & sarajedini 1999 , ferraro et al . 1999 ,",
    "zoccali et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in order to detect the bump a large sample of rgb stars is required ",
    "@xmath105 stars in the upper four magnitudes of the rgb according to fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1990 )  and until a few years ago it was detected only in metal - rich stars .",
    "in fact , increasing the cluster metallicity , the luminosity extension of the bump is larger and it is also shifted to lower luminosity , in a more populated rgb portion ; both effects work in the direction of making the bump detection easier . only in this last decade , thanks to the hst capability of imaging the dense gc cores , and the availability of large field ccd detectors , has the rgb bump been detected also in metal - poor gcs .",
    "since the position of the bump is related to the location inside the stellar structure of the h - discontinuity , the deeper the chemical discontinuity is located , the fainter the bump luminosity will be .",
    "a comparison of the theoretical bump level with observations allows a test of the predicted maximum extension of the convective envelope in rgb models . the parameter @xmath106  the v - magnitude difference between the rgb bump and the hb at the rr lyrae instability strip level ( fusi pecci et al . 1990 ,",
    "cassisi & salaris 1997 , hereinafter cs97 )  is commonly adopted as a measure of the bump brightness . from the observational point of view",
    "it is a distance independent quantity , but theoretically @xmath107depends not only on the bump level predicted by models , but also on the hb luminosity set by the value of @xmath3 at the he - flash , which is still subject to the uncertainties discussed before .    for a given set of input physics employed in the model computation @xmath107is affected mainly by the total metallicity [ m / h ] and the age of the cluster .",
    "as far as the age is concerned , an increase by 1 gyr at a given metallicity causes an increase of @xmath107by about 0.024 mag .",
    "as the hb luminosity is almost unaffected by the age  for typical gc ages  this change is due to the change in the bump luminosity : when the cluster age increases , the mass of the evolving rgb star decreases , and the h - discontinuity location deepens because of the larger convective regions .",
    "the effect associated with the cluster metallicity is significantly more relevant . for an age of 15 gyr ,",

    "for a long time , this result has been considered a clear drawback of canonical theoretical models of low - mass rgb stars .",
    "it was therefore suggested by alongi et al .",
    "( 1991 ) that this discrepancy can be removed accounting for the efficiency of overshooting from the base of the formal boundary of the convective envelope , which shifts the bump level to a lower brightness , because of the resulting deeper convective envelope . by parametrizing the mass extension of the overshooting region in units of the local pressure scale height ( @xmath112 ) , it was shown that an overshooting region of @xmath50.7@xmath112 could resolve the discrepancy .",
    "more recently , cs97 have reanalyzed the problem using their updated canonical stellar models applied to a sample of 8 clusters with spectroscopical determinations of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath10/fe ] , taking explicitly into account the effect of the @xmath10-element overabundance .",
    "they concluded that their models ( see previous relationship ) provide a good match to observations .",

    "1999 for a full discussion ) .",
    "we have considered an uncertainty on the global metallicity [ m / h ] of the order of 0.15 dex , which perhaps is a lower limit for the true uncertainties affecting both [ fe / h ] and @xmath114/fe ] measurements ( carney 1996 , rutledge , hesser & stetson 1997 ) .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ bumpvhbb ] shows a good agreement between theory and observations .",
    "in order to account for the current uncertainty on the zero point of the gc [ fe / h ] scale , the bottom panel shows the same comparison employing the zinn & west  ( 1984 ) [ fe / h ] scale . in this case , the agreement between theory and observations is worse , at least for metallicity lower than [ m / h]@xmath115 , where the two [ fe / h ] scales are most different : the disagreement with theoretical predictions for a cluster age of 14 gyrs is on average of about 0.20 mag , a value which is almost a factor of 2 larger than the mean photometric uncertainty .",
    "bergbusch & vandenberg  ( 2001 ) found a discrepancy of about 0.25 mag when comparing the results from their isochrones ( v00 models ) with @xmath107data for 4 gcs at various metallicities ( see their figure  17 ) .",
    "the bump brightness from their models is in good agreement with the cs97 results , while their hb models are about 0.05 mag fainter ; the gc [ fe / h ] values adopted in their comparison are within 0.1 dex of those by zinn & west  ( 1984 ) , whose metallicity scale they favored from other considerations .",
    "the conclusion to draw from this discussion is that the discrepancy found by fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1990 ) may well be reduced to zero without the need to include overshooting , but lingering uncertainties on the hb theoretical brightness ( due to the already discussed uncertainties on the @xmath3 value at the he - flash ) and gc metallicity scale , leaves open the possibility that a discrepancy at the level of @xmath50.20 mag between theory and observations may still exist , and one possibility to solve this discrepancy , if real , would be to consider overshooting from the convective envelope , as in the p00 models .",
    "the brightness of the lf bump is a diagnostic of the maximum extension of the convective envelope reached at the base of the rgb , but it does not provide information on the size of the jump in the h profile left over when the envelope starts to recede . since the evolutionary rate along the rgb is strongly affected by any change in the chemical profile ,",
    "it is clear that this information can be obtained by analyzing the star counts in the bump region .",
    "this is a further test for the accuracy and adequacy of canonical rgb models which has been performed by bono et al .  (",
    "they have defined a new parameter ",
    "@xmath116  which is the ratio between the number of stars in the region within @xmath117 mag and the number of rgb stars in the interval @xmath118 , ( where @xmath119 is the central magnitude of the bump region ) and compared theory with observation for a large sample of gcs , using the theoretical models by cs97 .",
    "figure  [ rbumpteo ] shows this comparison , and displays also the small dependence of @xmath116 on age and initial he content .",
    "it is also evident that the selected [ fe / h ] scale ( carretta & gratton  1997 in this case ) and [ @xmath10/fe ] values ( the same as in fig .",
    "[ bumpvhbb ] ) are not critical , due to the small variation of the predicted @xmath116 in the relevant metallicity range .",
    "observational data are well reproduced by theory , with the few discrepant points being representative of clusters with small rgb star samples and/or affected by differential reddening ( see the discussion by bono et al .",
    "apart from these , 47tuc ( marked as an open circle in fig .",
    "[ rbumpteo ] ) is the only cluster in clear disagreement with theory , in spite of the large sample of rgb stars observed , and deserves further detailed investigations .",
    "cassisi , salaris & bono  ( 2002 ) have recently shown that the rgb bump can be used to test not only the predicted size of the h - jump left over by the convective boundary at its maximum extension , but also the sharpness of this discontinuity .",
    "canonical models and even models with overshooting  as long as the mixing in the overshooting region is assumed to be instantaneous ",
    "predict a sharp discontinuity of the h - profile .",
    "conversely , any kind of non - instantaneous transport mechanism acting between the base of the convective envelope and a deeper region ( where the local h abundance is no longer equal to the envelope value ) which is able to build up abundance gradients , will smooth this sharp discontinuity , and affect the shape of the bump region in the lf ( see also bono & castellani  1992 ) .    cassisi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have computed models that simulate the occurrence of partial mixing processes at the bottom of the convective envelope of rgb stars . in particular , they have artificially modified the chemical element profiles of a model at the first dredge - up stage , smoothing out the sharp h - jump by means of a linear interpolation between the chemically homogeneous envelope and a region below the h - discontinuity .",
    "different smoothing lengths  parametrized as a function of the local pressure scale height  have been considered , and some representative results are shown in fig .",
    "[ smootlf ] .",
    "the bump shape produced by canonical models appears asymmetric when the bin size is kept sufficiently small and photometric errors are neglected , with its characteristic peak located in the brightest bump region . by applying some smoothing of the chemical discontinuity",
    ", the variations in the shapes of the lf bump are quite evident : when the smoothing length increases the bump becomes more centrally peaked and more symmetric .",
    "this occurrence is a consequence of the changes in the evolutionary rate of the h - burning shell when it encounters the h - discontinuity ( see cassisi et al .",
    "2002 for more details ) .",
    "larger smoothing regions imply a smoother discontinuity in the h - profile ( and in the molecular weight profile ) , and a smaller change in the efficiency of the h - burning shell .",
    "in particular , the narrowing of the bump width is related to the decrease of the luminosity drop occurring on the corresponding evolutionary track .",
    "the agreement between predicted and observed @xmath116 values also puts constraints to the maximum possible extension of the partial mixing region , which increases the he abundance in the envelope , thus reducing the overall jump in the h abundance and modifying the value of @xmath116 .",
    "smoothing lengths much larger than 1@xmath112 can be ruled out by the @xmath116 test .",
    "also the brightness level of the bump is modified by this process , becoming dimmer by @xmath120 mag for a variation by @xmath121 of the smoothing length .",
    "data plotted in fig .  [ smootlf ] show that smoothing lengths equal to or larger than @xmath122 affect significantly the shape of the lf bump . to check if this effect is detectable with real gc data , cassisi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have performed extensive monte - carlo simulations showing that in metal - rich gcs ( @xmath123\\approx-1.0 $ ] ) not affected by differential reddening , the effect of smoothing lengths equal or larger than @xmath124 can be detected with stellar samples larger than @xmath125 objects within @xmath126 mag of the bump peak , a bin size of at most 0.06 mag and @xmath127 photometric errors not larger than 0.03 mag ( see fig .  [ smootlf ] ) .",
    "these requirements can be met , at least for the more massive , metal - rich gcs , by using the new advanced camera for surveys ( clampin et al .",

    "ground based and hst observations of a large sample of rgb stars in ngc  2808 reported by bedin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , have led to the discovery of an additional bump in the lf of the gc ngc  2808 ( see fig .  [ heap ] ) .",
    "this bump , termed , appears at visual magnitudes @xmath128 mag brighter than the expected bump , and it is present both in the hst data  containing the central regions of the cluster  and in the ground - based data . from a preliminary analysis ,",
    "this feature appears real and , apparently , lends support to the evidence that a similar heap is also present in the hst data for the cluster 47  tuc ( bedin et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "canonical rgb stellar models do not predict any decrease of the evolutionary rate able to produce an increase in the star counts in the relevant region of the rgb .",
    "if the heap is assumed to be due to a change in the efficiency of h - burning , it could be interpreted as the byproduct of a deep - mixing episode , which somehow causes a temporary delay in the advancement of the h - shell .",
    "if this is the case , the lf heap could be adopted to constrain the extension of this deep - mixing in the stellar envelope . at the moment",
    ", one can conclude that if the heap is produced by deep - mixing processes , canonical stellar models underestimate the evolutionary lifetime during this phase by about 25% .    however , bedin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have noticed that , in the case of 47  tuc , the position of the heap in the lf is similar to the location of the k giant variables ( kgvs ) discovered in this cluster by edmonds & gilliland  ( 1996 ) .",
    "if the connection between the lf heap and the presence of the kgvs were to be confirmed by further observations , the heap could be simply related to the position along the rgb of the kgv instability strip and to their properties during the pulsational cycle .",
    "as discussed in  3 , the @xmath1-band magnitude of the trgb appears to be a very good standard candle .",
    "its predicted value depends on the trgb bolometric magnitude derived from the models which , in turn , depends on the size of the he - core at the he - flash , and it is influenced by any uncertainty affecting the equation of state of partially electron degenerate matter , neutrino energy losses , electron conduction opacity , and the nuclear cross section for the @xmath129-reaction . in fig .",
    "[ comptip ] we show a comparison of the most recent results concerning the trgb bolometric magnitude and @xmath3 at the he - flash ; the displayed quantities refer to a 0.8@xmath6 model and various initial metallicities ( scaled solar metal distribution ) .",

    "if one neglects for a moment the p00 and yy01 models , the reason for the 0.1 mag spread among the rest of the authors is mainly due to the electron conduction opacities .",

    "all observational points lie below the theoretical value , being on average about 0.10 - 0.20 mag underluminous .",
    "this is exactly what is expected in case of consistency between the zahb and trgb distance scale , since , given the size of the rgb star samples observed by fpc83 and the evolutionary timescales close to the trgb , it is statistically unlikely to have detected a star exactly at the trgb ( see , e.g. , the discussions in raffelt  1990 , castellani , deglinnocenti & luridiana  1993 , salaris & cassisi  1997 ) .",
    "caloi , dantona & mazzitelli  ( 1997 ) obtained the same results with their rgb and zahb models .",
    "this comparison enables us to perform another independent test for the efficiency of deep mixing in rgb stars ( see  7 ) .",
    "sweigart  ( 1997a ) has computed some evolutionary models for low - mass rgb stars considering mixing of some helium from the h - burning shell into the envelope .",
    "a consequence of this mixing is to increase both the trgb and the zahb luminosity level . by parametrizing the efficiency of the deep mixing in term of the amount of hydrogen @xmath139 carried into the h - shell , sweigart found that @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "since the hb is twice as sensitive as the the trgb to the efficiency of this extra mixing process , one should expect that the comparison between zahb and trgb distances discussed before could constrain the efficiency of this mechanism , if to occur at all .",
    "assuming all stars in a given cluster experience this mixing process , for a given value of @xmath139 the zahb brightness increases more than the trgb one , thus moving upwards the trgb absolute brightness with respect to the theoretical prediction . in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "<S> theoretical predictions of red giant branch stars effective temperatures , colors , luminosities and surface chemical abundances are a necessary tool for the astrophysical interpretation of the visible  near infrared integrated light from unresolved stellar populations , the color - magnitude - diagrams of resolved stellar clusters and galaxies , and spectroscopic determinations of red giant chemical abundances . on the other hand , the comparison with empirical constraints provides a stringent test for the accuracy of present generations of red giant models .    </S>",
    "<S> we review the current status of red giant stars modelling , discussing in detail the still existing uncertainties affecting the model input physics ( e.g. , electron conduction opacity , treatment of the superadiabatic convection ) , and the adequacy of the physical assumptions built into the model computations .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare theory with several observational features of the red giant branch in galactic globular clusters , such as the luminosity function , the luminosity of the red giant branch tip and the envelope chemical abundance patterns , to show the level of agreement between current stellar models and empirical data concerning the stellar luminosities , star counts , and surface chemical abundances . </S>"
