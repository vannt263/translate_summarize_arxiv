    "interstellar masers are one of the most readily observed signposts of star formation , particularly emission from the hydroxyl ( oh ) , water ( h@xmath1o ) and methanol ( ch@xmath2oh ) molecules as they are relatively common and intense . because these masers arise at radio frequencies , they are not affected by the dense optical - obscuring gas and dust present at the early stages of massive star formation thereby allowing us to probe these stars at the earliest stages .",
    "the masers are powerful probes of the kinematics of the star formation regions , but we are only recently beginning to be able to use the masers to investigate aspects such as the physical conditions through comparison of observational data and maser pumping theories @xcite .",
    "the different maser species favour different physical conditions and are thought to trace different evolutionary phases of massive star formation @xcite .",
    "since many sources show emission from multiple maser transitions or species there must be significant overlap for the evolutionary phase traced by the most common types of masers .",
    "interstellar masers have been detected towards more than a thousand star formation regions in our galaxy from transitions of methanol , hydroxyl and water .",
    "transitions of class ii methanol masers have some advantages over water and oh masers as they exclusively trace sites of massive star formation @xcite while water and oh are known to also be associated with other astrophysical objects such as evolved stars and supernova remnants .",
    "two of the strongest maser species found towards star formation regions are transitions of methanol at 6.7- and 12.2-ghz , both of which are known to trace an early evolutionary stage of massive star formation @xcite .",
    "complementary observations of these two strong methanol maser transitions are especially useful in probing the physical conditions of the environments in which they arise , as they are known to typically be co - spatial @xcite .    to date",
    "there have been several searches for 12.2-ghz methanol maser emission towards 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite targeted their search for 12.2-ghz methanol masers towards 238 6.7-ghz methanol masers that had been detected towards sites of oh masers and achieved a detection rate of 55 per cent .",
    "@xcite directed their observations at 12.2-ghz towards 6.7-ghz methanol masers that were observed towards a sample of _ iras _ ( infrared astronomy satellite ) selected sources @xcite as well as 6.7  ghz methanol masers that were detected in a blind search that had relatively poor positional accuracy and sensitivity @xcite .",
    "searches such as those by @xcite and @xcite have shown that 12.2-ghz methanol maser emission is only rarely brighter than the associated 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission .",
    "this coupled with the fact that there have been no serendipitous detections of 12.2-ghz masers without a 6.7-ghz counterpart mean that it is unlikely that an unbiased galactic survey would uncover many , if any , more 12.2-ghz methanol masers than would be yielded from a search targeted towards 6.7-ghz methanol maser sources .",
    "recently , a small subset of the strong 6.7-ghz methanol masers from the sources observed by @xcite at 1.2-mm , were searched for the presence of 12.2-ghz methanol masers with the university of tasmania 26  m mount pleasant radio telescope @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected 17 12.2-ghz methanol masers towards the 27 sites searched with a detection limit of @xmath34  jy .",
    "@xcite observed 131 regions that were suspected of undergoing massive star formation , using the presence of previously identified 6.7-ghz methanol masers and/or an ultracompact hii region to select these regions .",
    "a total of 404 1.2-mm dust clumps were identified , with 113 of these associated with 6.7-ghz methanol masers , 35 of which are associated with radio continuum emission @xcite .    statistical analysis by @xcite of the properties of 1.2-mm dust clumps associated with 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission with and without 12.2-ghz methanol masers showed that those 1.2-mm dust clumps with both 6.7-ghz and 12.2-ghz were less massive and less dense than the 1.2-mm clumps that were associated with only 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission .",
    "comparison between the 6.7-ghz methanol masers with detected 12.2-ghz with those with no detectable 12.2-ghz maser emission , showed that 12.2-ghz methanol masers were preferentially found at those 6.7-ghz methanol maser sites with associated oh emission ( to a better than 95 per cent confidence ) .",
    "as oh masers are expected to trace a generally later stage of star formation @xcite than 6.7-ghz methanol masers . as the sample size of the @xcite observations was small , was subject to a 6.7-ghz flux density bias and had relatively poor sensitivity , the aim of the current work was to confirm these results by testing a large sample with a much lower 12.2-ghz detection limit .",
    "here we present a targeted search for 12.2-ghz methanol masers , with a greatly increased sample size and sensitivity ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , towards 113 known 6.7-ghz methanol masers which have been previously targeted for 1.2-mm dust continuum emission @xcite .",
    "statistical analysis of the 1.2-mm dust clumps devoid of either methanol maser transition and those associated with 12.2-ghz and/or 6.7-ghz methanol maser sources has been carried out , with a particular emphasis on the investigation of the relative evolutionary stage each class of source is tracing .",
    "we have searched 113 6.7-ghz methanol masers , towards which @xcite observed 1.2-mm dust clump continuum emission , for the presence of associated 12.2-ghz methanol maser emission .",
    "observations were carried out with the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) parkes 64-m radio telescope during 2008 june 20 - 25 .",
    "follow - up observations of two sources were made on 2008 december 7 using an identical set - up to the observations carried out in 2008 june .",
    "the observations were made with the ku - band receiver which detected two orthogonal linear polarizations and had typical system temperatures of 205 and 225 jy for the respective polarizations throughout the observations .",
    "the parkes multibeam correlator was configured to record 8192 channels over 16-mhz for each of the recorded linearly polarized signals .",
    "this configuration yielded a useable velocity coverage of @xmath3290 @xmath4 and a spectral resolution of 0.08 @xmath4 , after hanning smoothing .",
    "the parkes radio telescope has rms pointing errors of @xmath310 arcsec and at 12.2-ghz the telescope has a half power beam width of 1.9 arcmin .",
    "all sources were observed at a fixed frequency of 12178-mhz ( i.e. with no doppler tracking ) , which alleviated the requirement for a unique reference observation to be made for each of the source positions . instead , all the spectra collected each day",
    "were combined to form a sensitive reference bandpass by taking the median value of each channel .",
    "the noise contribution to the quotient spectrum from such a reference is negligible and means that the theoretical radiometer noise is achieved for each observation .",
    "as the bandpass is not constant throughout an observing session , observing in this mode introduced ripples into the quotient spectra .",
    "this was overcome by subtracting a running median over 100 channels from the baseline . as the maser lines are much narrower than 100 channels this has little effect on emission spectra but may have an adverse effect on absorption features which are of a comparable width .",
    "our ability to detect absorption is therefore reduced and in most cases where we do detect absorption it appears narrower and weaker than it would have been if we had employed a more traditional , but less efficient , observing method . in order to determine the absorption characteristics of the sources , spectra where absorption features were detected were boxcar smoothed over 20 channels , decreasing our spectra resolution to 0.26 @xmath4 and resulted in a typical rms noise of @xmath30.04  jy .",
    "data were reduced using asap ( atnf spectral analysis package ) .",
    "alignment of velocity channels was carried out during processing .",
    "absolute flux density calibration was achieved by observing pks b1934638 each day which has an assumed flux density of 1.825 jy at 12178-mhz @xcite .",
    "each target was observed for 10 minutes , and once the polarizations were averaged yielded a typical rms noise of 0.11  jy corresponding to a 5-@xmath0 detection limit of 0.55  jy .",
    "for weak sources ( of comparable strength to our detection limit ) , individual polarizations were inspected as a further check on the reliability of the detection .",
    "the adopted rest frequency was 12.178597 ghz @xcite .",
    "our search , for 12.2-ghz methanol masers , targeted 113 6.7-ghz methanol maser sites and resulted in the detection of 68 12.2-ghz methanol masers , equating to a detection rate of 60 per cent .",
    "a search of the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveals that 30 of these are new detections .",
    "a number of the 12.2-ghz methanol masers that have been previously observed , particularly the stronger ones , were discovered prior to @xcite by others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , direct comparison of the majority of these sources are complicated by large positional uncertainties , pointing offsets and the limited velocity ranges covered in the observations .",
    "table  [ tab : sources ] summarizes information on the targeted 6.7-ghz methanol masers @xcite , associated 12.2-ghz methanol masers that we detect , along with the 1.2-mm dust clump @xcite that each methanol maser site is associated with . for the majority of sources , precise positions for the 6.7-ghz methanol maser sources",
    "have been determined with the australia telescope compact array to an accuracy better than 1 arcsec .",
    "there are five instances where two methanol masers are associated with the same dust clump , therefore our observations targeted a total of 106 1.2-mm dust clumps .",
    "spectra of the detected 12.2-ghz methanol masers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] and are presented in order of galactic longitude except for where vertical alignment of nearby sources was necessary to highlight where features of a source were also detected at nearby positions .",
