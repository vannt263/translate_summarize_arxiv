    "the existence of @xmath3 was first theoretically demonstrated by pauling and tolman @xcite ; see also tolman @xcite .",
    "in addition , the existence of the residual entropy has been demonstrated rigorously for a very general spin model by chow and wu @xcite .",
    "the residual entropy for glycerol was observed by gibson and giauque @xcite and for ice by giauque and ashley @xcite .",
    "pauling @xcite provided the first numerical estimate for the residual entropy for ice , which was later improved by nagle @xcite .",
    "nagle s numerical estimate has been recently verified by simulation @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation carried out by bowles and speedy @xcite for glassy dimers also supports the existence of a residual entropy . for a brief review of the history of the residual entropy ,",

    "thus , it appears that the support in favor of the residual entropy , see the curve glass1 in see fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] , is quite strong .",
    "its existence also does not violate nernst s postulate , as the latter is applicable only to true equilibrium states with a _ non - degenerate _ ground state @xcite .",
    "indeed , many exactly solved statistical mechanical models show a non - zero entropy at absolute zero . however , as of yet , no experiment can be performed at absolute zero to experimentally determine the residual entropy ; in all cases , some sort of _ extrapolation _ is required .",
    "this point should not be forgotten in the following whenever we speak of the residual entropy . despite the above mentioned support for the reality of the residual entropy , it has become a highly debated issue in the literature @xcite as discussed by these authors .",
    "the reason for the debate is that the relationship among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the entropy @xmath2 of the corresponding stationary state is not well understood , and understanding this relationship is the main theme of this work .",
    "[ ptb ]    system_modified_1.eps    in the following , we will speak of `` the equilibrium '' state associated with a nonequilibrium state as the stationary ( time - independent ) state . depending on the context",
    ", the equilibrium state may represent a true equilibrium state such as a crystal or a stationary metastable state such as the supercooled liquid . a nonequilibrium state in this work",

    ", we will not be concerned with @xmath11 .",

    ", we will consider supercooled liquids and associated nonequilibrium states ( glasses ) in the following , but the arguments are applicable to all nonequilibrium states .",
    "the supercooled liquid undergoes a glass transition over a transition range , see fig .",

    "the transition region is controlled by the rate of cooling so that the glass is a nonequilibrium state @xcite . as the irreversibility due to",
    "the glass transition does not allow for an exact evaluation of the entropy , it has been suggested @xcite that the entropy decreases by an amount almost equal to @xmath3 within the glass transition region so that the glass ( see glass2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] , whose entropy lies below the supercooled liquid ) would have a vanishing entropy at absolute zero .",
    "it has been shown by goldstein @xcite that glass2 results in a violation of the second law .",
    "it should be stressed that if there is ever any _ conflict _ between the second law @xcite and any other law in physics such as the zeroth or the third law , it is the second law that is believed to hold in _ all _ cases .",
    "one can also argue that to confine the glass into a _",
    "unique _ basin in the energy landscape requires _ microscopic _",
    "information @xcite ; hence , the particular glass _ can not _",
    "be considered in a macrostate .",
    "oppenheim @xcite has also raised somewhat of a similar objection .",
    "we have drawn the two entropy curves ( glass1 or glass2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] that emerge out of the entropy curve for the equilibrated supercooled liquid for a given @xmath12 in such a way that glass1 has its entropy above ( so that @xmath13 )  and glass2 below ( so that @xmath14 ) that of the supercooled liquid .",
    "the entropy of glass1 ( glass2 ) approaches that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid entropy from above ( below ) during isothermal ( fixed temperature of the medium ) relaxation ; see the two downward vertical arrows for glass1 .",
    "it is the approach to equilibrium that distinguishes the two glasses , glass1 and glass2 .",
    "almost all experimental investigations leave open the possibility that glass2 may materialize if the irreversibility is too large .",

    "we proceed by following the strict second law inequality @xmath15 @xcite , see eq .",

    "[ fig_entropyglass ] ) without violating of the second law @xcite .",

    "this is the meaning behind the usage of `` ... rigorous ... '' in the title .",
    "the actual values of the entropy are not relevant for the aim of this work , which is to find the relationship among different entropies under vitrification . because of the possibility that the systems may be far away from equilibrium such as in a fast quench , where the irreversible contributions may not be neglected , our results go beyond the previous calorimetric evidence @xcite .",
    "the systems we are interested in include glasses and imperfect crystals as special cases .",

    "the temperature of the medium is isobarically changed by some small but fixed @xmath18 from the current value to the new value , and we wait for ( not necessarily fixed ) time @xmath12 at the new temperature to make an instantaneous measurement on the system before changing the temperature again . at some temperature @xmath19 , see fig .",

    "we overlook the possibility of the supercooled liquid ending in a spinodal @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that @xmath24 will vanish at absolute zero ( @xmath25 ) , as shown in the figure .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the actual value of @xmath24 has no relevance for the theorems below .",
    "we will only consider isobaric cooling ( we will not explicitly exhibit the pressure in this section ) , which is the most important situation for glasses .",
    "the process is carried out along some path from an initial state a at temperature @xmath8 in the supercooled liquid state which is still higher than @xmath19 to the state a@xmath26 at absolute zero .",
    "the state a@xmath26 depends on the path a@xmath27a@xmath26 , which is implicit in the following .",
    "the change @xmath28 between two neighboring points along such a path is @xmath29 in modern notation @xcite .",
    "the component @xmath30 represents the reversible entropy exchange with the medium in terms of the exchange heat @xmath31 ( in keeping with the modern notation ) added to the glass by the medium at time @xmath32 to the medium at @xmath8 and the heat capacity @xmath33 .",
    "it also represents the _ calorimetrically _ determined change in the entropy in any process .",
    "the component @xmath34 represents the irreversible entropy generation within the system in the irreversible process , and contains , in addition to the contribution from the irreversible heat transfer with the medium , contributions from all sorts of viscous dissipation going on _ within _ the system and normally require the use of internal variables @xcite . the equality in eq .",
    "( [ second_law_inequality ] ) holds for a reversible process , which we will no longer consider unless stated otherwise .",
    "a discontinuous change in the entropy is ruled out from the continuity of the gibbs free energy @xmath35 and the enthalpy @xmath36 in vitrification proved elsewhere @xcite .",

    "we take @xmath8 to be the melting temperature @xmath54 , and uniquely determine the entropy of the supercooled liquid at @xmath54 by adding the entropy of melting to the crystal entropy @xmath55 at @xmath54 .",
    "the latter is obtained in a unique manner by integration along a reversible path from @xmath56 to @xmath57 : @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the entropy of the crystal at absolute zero , which is traditionally taken to be zero in accordance with the third law , and @xmath60 is the isobaric heat capacity of the crystal .",
