    "the fixed limiting magnitude of @xmath5 mag onboard rvs was changed to an adaptive one in september 2015 .",
    "now the limiting magnitude ranges from @xmath6 mag as a function of time , corresponding to the straylight pattern to save telemetry on spectra that contain more noise than signal . selecting milky way halo stars from the gums simulation @xcite with @xmath7 mag",
    "suggests that rvs is collecting spectra for @xmath31.8 million stars in the milky way s halo , the majority of which will be metal - poor giants .",
    "having approximately verified the rv performance model in section [ sec1 ] with preliminary measurements , we apply this model to each gums star .",
    "this predicts an _ upper _ limit ( due to the adaptive limiting magnitude ) on the number of halo stars in the final _ gaia _ catalogue with @xmath8 km  s@xmath0 : @xmath3800,000 , @xmath342% of the observed halo stars ( red / dark grey dots in fig .",

    ", it has not been tested that the data follow poisson statistics and so whether the predictions are valid .",
    "rvs spectra were obtained with a fixed across scan ( ac ) window width of 10 pixels .",
    "the rvs s / n simulator suggests that adapting the ac width to the observing conditions could mitigate the impact of straylight , recovering @xmath30.14 mag .",
    "this would increase the aforementioned predicted upper limit to @xmath3900,000 , a 13% increase ( all galactic components increase by several million ) .",
