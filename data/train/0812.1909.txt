    "recently , relativistic simulations have been performed to study the dynamics of the magnetospheres of neutron stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite reported the results of 2-dimensional relativistic force - free simulations of the magnetar flares triggered by the injection of the magnetic twists at the footpoints of the loops .",
    "when the critical twist is accumulated , the magnetic loops expand relativistically .",
    "@xcite carried out 2-dimensional relativistic force - free simulations of expanding magnetic loops and showed that the lorentz factor defined by the drift velocity @xmath2 exceeds 10 ( see , * ? ? ? * for the definition of the drift velocity ) .",

    "the latter model was employed by @xcite as a test problem to check the validity and accuracy of axisymmetric mhd codes . in magnetar flares ,",
    "the magnetic loops may be twisted by the shear motion at the footpoints of the loops .",
    "the shear motion generates alfvn waves propagating along the field lines .",
    "such twisted magnetic loops expand by the enhanced magnetic pressure by the toroidal magnetic fields .",

    "in dipolar solution , the displacement current becomes larger than the real current @xmath309 for faster expansion speed ( @xmath310 ) .",
    "this effect reduces the toroidal current and weakens the magnetic tension force . to balance the reduced magnetic tension force , the pressure decreases .",

    "the energy is transferred to @xmath160 unless condition ( [ sol2:knowave ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the condition can be interpreted as that for the total reflection of the mhd waves in the shell .",

    "the shell and flux rope solutions have perfectly reflecting solutions in which the total energy in @xmath120 is conserved .",
    "it means that the solutions are energy eigenstates of the system .",
    "the eigenstates can be obtained by adjusting the parameter @xmath92 .    in this paper",
    ", we obtained solutions for freely expanding magnetic loops , i.e. , @xmath312 .",
    "we assumed that the magnetic loops have sufficiently large energy to drive the expansion .",
    "when the flux function @xmath24 increases with time , the toroidal magnetic fields will also increase with time .",
    "the toroidal magnetic fields will then affect the dynamics through the magnetic pressure .",
    "such solutions can describe the accelerating magnetic loops .",
    "magnetic fields can be expressed as the sum of the fourier modes in the polar angle .",
    "the modes and their amplitudes should be determined at the boundary where the magnetic twist is injected on the surface of the star .",
    "it is not shown but we can construct more complex solutions that the poloidal magnetic fields are expressed by the sum of the fourier modes , i.e. , @xmath313 . in actual explosion ,",
    "the opening angle of the expanding magnetic loops depends on the location at which the magnetic twist is injected on the surface of the central star .",
    "such a solution may be expressed as the sum of the fourier modes for the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "we should note that sgr flares are not necessarily axisymmetric .",
    "models including the non - axisymmetrically expanding magnetic loops will be a subject of future works .",
