    "the dynamics of darwinian evolution is intrinsically frequency dependent , the fitness of individuals is tightly coupled to the type and number of competitors .",
    "evolutionary dynamics acts , however , on populations , not individuals and as a consequence depends on not only population composition , but also population size and structure .",
    "evolutionary game theory came about as the result of the realization that frequency dependent fitness introduces strategic aspects to evolution @xcite . more recently",
    "the investigation of the evolutionary dynamics of structured populations , where individuals only compete with some subset of the population , e.g.   their neighbors in space or more generally in some graph @xcite , has lead to the recognition that the success of different strategies can be greatly influenced by the topology of interactions within the population .",
    "fundamental differences were found  compared to well - mixed populations , where individuals interact with randomly chosen partners  in models that describe the evolution of cooperation ( variants of the prisoner s dilemma game @xcite ) or deal with the maintenance of biodiversity in the context of competitive cycles ( variants of the rock - paper - scissors game @xcite ) .    in order to investigate the coevolutionary dynamics of games on structured populations the full set of connections between a potentially very large number of individuals must be specified .",
    "this is only possible by reducing the number of degrees of freedom considered , either through postulating a highly symmetrical ( such as lattices @xcite ) or fundamentally random connection structure ( such as some random graph ensemble @xcite ) .",
    "the question of how one goes about the task of reducing the number of degrees of freedom  of choosing the relevant parameters to describe the population structure constrained to which individuals undergo evolution  is not trivial .",
    "both the explicit spatial as well as the random graph ensemble approach have clear precedents in condensed matter physics and network theory , respectively .",

    "let us consider colicin producing bacteria , that play the so called `` rock - paper - scissors '' ( rps ) game ( for details see below ) .",
    "this system has recently been the subject of two experimental studies aimed at demonstrating the role of structured populations in the maintenance of diversity . in the first study @xcite bacteria were cultured _ in vitro _ in petri dishes , effectively restricting competition between bacteria to neighbors on the ( 2d ) petri dish surface ( fig.1 top left ) , while in the second experiment @xcite _ in vivo _ bacterial colonies were established in co - caged mice and their development was subsequently followed . in the case of the first experiment",
    "the analogy with explicit 2d spatial embedding ( present by construction ) is clear ( fig.1 bottom left ) .",
    "the population structure of the second experiment is , however , clearly different .",
    "the bacteria in individual mice can be readily considered as locally well - mixed populations , the coevolutionary dynamics of which reduces in the standard meanfield limit to a system of non - linear differential equations ( the adjusted replicator equations @xcite ) . as the experiments show",
    ", however , migration of bacteria between mice may also occur  resulting in the observed cyclic presence of the three strains in individuals .",
    "there are two distinct scales of mixing present in the system",
    ". bacteria within each mice compete with each other forming local populations  an unstructured neighborhood composed of individual bacteria , while also being exposed to migrants from mice with whom they share the cage , together forming a global population  an unstructured neighborhood composed of individual local populations ( fig.1 top and bottom right ) .",
    "this setup is referred to in the ecology literature  albeit in significantly different contexts  as a  structured metapopulation ",
    "@xcite where structured here refers to the detailed consideration of the population dynamics of the individual populations ( often called  patches  ) comprising the metapopulation and is also related to the finite island models of population genetics @xcite .",
    "the above example of co - caged mice is not unique , we may readily think of other ecological or sociological examples where an approximation with hierarchical scales of mixing with no internal structure can be relevant ( such as human societies with two distinct scales of mixing present , the first within individual nations the between them at an international level ) .",
    "we have , also , recently used a similar approach to construct a model of genetic exchange among bacteria of the same species ( the bacterial equivalent of sex ) with which we were able to take into account the effects of spatial and temporal fluctuations in a manner that can explain the benefit of such genetic exchange at the level of the individual @xcite .    in this paper we construct a hierarchical meanfield theory where the two distinct ( i.e.  local and global ) scales of mixing are each taken into account in terms of two separate _ meanfield _ approximations and fluctuations resulting from finite population size on the local scale of mixing are also considered .",
    "we subsequently explore the similarities and differences between this and other models of structured populations in the case of the  rock - paper - scissors  and prisoner s dilemma games . through these examples",
    "we suggest that our approach allows the separation of the effects of structured populations on coevolutionary dynamics into effects which are highly sensitive to and dependent on the details of the topology and those which only require the minimal structure present in our approximation and can consequently ( in terms of sensitivity to the details of the topology ) be considered more robust .",

    "assuming finite and constant population size , natural selection can be described at the level of the individual by the so called the moran process @xcite , during which at each time step an individual is selected randomly from the population to be replaced ( death ) by the offspring of an individual that is chosen proportional to its fitness to reproduce ( birth ) .",
    "this models a population in equilibrium , where the time scale of the population dynamics is set by the rate at which  vacancies  become available in the population .",

    "a random individual is replaced at each time step either with the offspring of an individual from the same population ( local reproduction ) or with an individual from the global population ( global mixing ) .",

    "the choice of appropriate @xmath38 depends on the details of the global mixing mechanism , for systems where only the offspring of individuals mix globally it is proportional to the fitness of a given type , while for mechanisms such as physical mixing , by e.g.  wind or ocean currents , it may be identical for each type . irrespective of the details",
    ", however , the probability of an individual of some type @xmath4 filling in a new vacancy due to global mixing should be proportional to the global average of the number of individuals of type @xmath4 multiplied by their mixing tendency , which we denoted as @xmath39 , and the strength of global mixing @xmath33 .",

    "the above advection - diffusion equation ( [ adv_diff_eq ] ) presents an intuitive picture of the coevolutionary dynamics of the population at a global scale .",
    "we can see that local populations each attempt to follow the trajectories corresponding to the deterministic replicator dynamics , while under the influence of two additional opposing forces : ( i ) global mixing , which attempts to synchronize local dynamics and ( ii ) diffusion resulting from finite population size effects , which attempts to smear them out over the simplex .",
    "the strength of these forces are tuned by two parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "if , further , the effects of synchronization are irrelevant , as for example in the case of populations where selection is externally driven by independent environmental fluctuations , we may replace the global population average with the time average of any single population .",

    "this classic framework is most wide spread in the ecology literature , a less often employed extension is the concept of a structured metapopulation where the state of the individual populations is considered in more detail , this is more similar to our concept of hierarchical mixing , but differs in considering the possibility of local extinctions .",
    "the effects of finite population size and migration , which our model considers , has been of more central concern in the population genetics literature .",
    "the analog of levin s classic metapopulation concept is often referred to as the finite - island model @xcite the effective population genetic parameters describing which , have been explored in detail@xcite .",
    "the study of the population genetics of spatially subdivided populations in fact predates levin , wright having emphasised the capacity of drift in small populations to bring about genetic differentiation in the face of selection and/or migration several decades prior@xcite .",
    "our hierarchical mixing model treats the coevolutionary dynamics of evolutionary games on structured populations in a manner similar to the most simple population genetic models of spatially subdivided populations , focusing on the parallel effects of selection , drift and migration .",
    "it goes beyond these models both in considering the effects of frequency dependent selection ( and the strategic aspects of the evolutionary dynamics this implies ) and in using a self - consistent approach to describe the global state of the subdivided population .",
    "also , in order to maintain a connection with previous work on the effects of spatial structure on evolutionary games , which rely on nowak s concept of spatial games @xcite , with individuals restricted to interact , and hence compete , only with neighbours as defined by some topology of interaction , we develop our model from the level of the individual by introducing a modified version of the moran process  and not by extending the wright - fisher process ( which considers discrete generations and binomial sampling to account for finite population size ) .",
    "the effective population structure described by our hierarchical mixing model can be thought of as a population of individuals , interactions among which are specified by the edges of a hierarchically organized random graph .",
    "the fundamental difference in our picture is that the edges of this graph of interactions are not considered to be fixed , but are instead in a constant state of change , being present with a different probability between pairs of individuals who share the same local population and between pairs of individuals who do not ( fig.1 . ) .",
    "we consider annealed randomness , which in contrast to the usual quenched picture of fixed edges is insensitive to the details of topology .",
    "our approach we believe best facilitates the exploration of the effects of changing the relative strengths of drift and migration in the context of evolutionary games on structured populations .    examining the effects of hierarchical mixing in the context of the evolution of robustness we demonstrated that biased influx coupled with drift can result in cooperation being favored , provided the ratio of benefit to cost exceeds the local population size .",
    "this result bears striking resemblance to that of ohtsuki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who were able to calculate the fixation probability of a randomly placed mutant for any two - person , two - strategy game on a regular graph and found that cooperation is favored provided the ratio of benefit to cost exceeds the degree of the graph .",
    "our results demonstrate that this rule extends to the minimal spatial structure induced by hierarchical levels of mixing .    applying our model of spatial structure to",
    "the repeated prisoners dilemma revealed that a constant influx of defectors can help to stabilize cycles of cooperation , defection , and reciprocity through preventing the emergence of an intermittent period of allc domination in the population , which would present a situation that  leaves the door wide open  to domination by defectors . while previous work has been done on the effects of  forcing ",
    "cooperation @xcite the idea that an influx of defectors can in fact stabilize the role of reciprocity in promoting cooperation has not been proposed previously .",
    "it seems highly unlikely that this mechanism can be explained in terms of kin or multilevel ( group ) selection , the similarities between which in structured populations have recently been the subject of intensive debate ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite or @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "kin selection can operate whenever interactions occurring among individuals who share a more recent common ancestor than individuals sampled randomly from the whole population @xcite are relevant . in our case",
    "it is the interaction between defectors , arriving from the global scale , and tft players present at the local scale that is important , and not the interaction between individuals in the local population , who may be thought of as sharing a recent common ancestor due to local dispersal .",
    "also , while the concept of multilevel selection presents a promising framework for the study of evolution of cooperation , it must nonetheless be possible to derive it from  first principles   just as kin selection can be cast as an emergent effect of local dispersal .",
    "while there has been considerable work on studying the evolutionary games on graphs and highly symmetric spatial structures very little attention has been paid to the effects of more minimal effective population structures , despite their widespread application in ecology and population genetics , fields from which evolutionary game theory was born and must ultimately reconnect with .",
    "we believe that the minimal population structure that such a hierarchical meanfield theory describes is potentially more relevant in a wide range of natural systems , than more subtle setups with a delicate dependence on the details and symmetries of the topology .",
    "we showed through two examples that such structure is sufficient for the emergence of some phenomena previously only observed for explicit spatial embedding , demonstrating the potential of our model to identify robust effects of population structure on the dynamics of evolutionary games that do not depend on the details of the underlying topology .",
    "the practical advantage of our approach , lies in its ability to readily determine whether or not some feature of a structured population depends on the topological details of local interactions .",
    "recent simulation result concerning the dynamics of public goods games on different population structures @xcite and experiments where global mixing in an rps like bacteria - phage system lead to the emergence of a  tragedy of the commons ",
    "scenario @xcite should all be amicable to analysis in terms of our method .",
    "this work was partially supported by the hungarian scientific research fund under grant no : otka 60665 .",
    "our approach readily generalizes for an arbitrary number of hierarchical mixing levels . for three levels of mixing we may consider the global population to be comprised of @xmath121 subpopulations each of which is in turn subdivided into @xmath34 local populations . with @xmath122 running over subpopulations and @xmath123 over local populations",
    "the transition probabilities can be written as : @xmath124 where primed indices indicate the scale of mixing over which the average is taken , @xmath125 describes the strength of mixing , and the @xmath126 the tendencies of mixing among local populations within a subpopulation , while @xmath127 describes the strength of mixing , and the @xmath128 the tendencies of mixing among subpopulations in the global population .",
