    "there has been a steady interest in the problem of `` collapse of the wavefunction '' amongst quantum physicists , particularly in relation to foundational issues .",
    "the dichotomy usually presented is between the unitary evolution under the schrdinger equation and the discontinuous change when a measurement is made .",
    "clearly the collapse of the wavefunction is a form of conditioning the quantum state made by an instantaneous measurement .",
    "however , conditional probabilities are well known classically and have no such interpretational issues .",
    "furthermore , the process of extraction of information from a classical system and the resulting conditioning of the state is well studied from the point of view of stochastic estimation . for continual measurements ,",
    "there are standard results on nonlinear filtering , see @xcite .",
    "what is not often appreciated in the theoretical physics community is that the analogue problem was formulated by belavkin @xcite where a quantum theory of filtering based on non - demolition measurements of an output field is established : see also @xcite-@xcite . specifically , we must measure a particular feature of the field , for instance a field quadrature or the count of the field quanta , and this determines a self - commuting , therefore _ essentially classical _ , stochastic process .",
    "the resulting equations have structural similarities with the classical analogues .",
    "they are also formally identical with the equations arising in quantum trajectory theory @xcite however the stochastic master equations play different roles : in quantum filtering they describe the conditioned evolution of the state while in quantum trajectories they are a means of simulating a master equation .",
    "there has been recent interest amongst the physics community in quantum filtering as an applied technique in quantum feedback and control @xcite- @xcite .",
    "an additional driver is the desire to go beyond the situation of a vacuum field and derive the filter for other physically important states such as thermal , squeezed , single photon states , etc . in a previous publication",
    "@xcite we derived a quantum markovian model for an opto - mechanical system consisting of a quantum mechanical mirror interacting with quantum optical input fields via radiation pressure , and in particular were able to construct the quantum filter for the position of the mirror based on the continual monitoring of scattered photons . to obtain a non - trivial result , we had to place the input fields in a coherent state of non - zero intensity and rely on the filtering theory for coherent state inputs @xcite . in this note",
    "we wish to treat the problem of constructing the filter for non - demolition quadrature and photon - counting measurements of the output of a mach - zehnder interferometer with the purpose of estimating the phase difference between the two arms of the interferometer : see figure [ fig : interferometer ] .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    here the phase is treated as a quantum mechanical object , so the problem is genuinely one of estimating the quantum state of the interferometer phase variable . as the interaction of the photons with the interferometer is purely scattering ( so no emission or absorption ) we must take one of input fields to be in a coherent state with intensity function @xmath0 .",
    "the model may be thought of as the continuous variable analogue of the discrete model examined recently by harrell in @xcite : indeed , it is reasonable to expect that the continuous time limit of this model leads to the results presented here by the time of arguments presented in @xcite .",

    "we describe the model of a mach - zehnder interferometer with appropriate continuous - variable quantum inputs . a fully quantum stochastic model of the interferometer phase observable and the photon fields",
    "is presented in terms of quantum stochastic calculus @xcite-@xcite . in section [ sec : filter ] we describe the basic estimation problem and state the main result which is the form of the filters in the language of stochastic estimation : these may then be rewritten in terms of stochastic master equations , and we give the equivalent form for homodyning . in section [ sec : derive_filters ] we derive the filters using the characteristic function approach . finally in section [ sec : applications ] we solve the filter in a linearized regime - equivalent to a quantum kalman - bucy filter and discuss the physical properties of the system including the `` collapse of the wave - function '' .",

    "the conditional variance is converging to zero as we acquire more information through the quadrature measurement .",
    "what should happen in the long time asymptotic limit is that , for any interval @xmath173 , the probability of the observed position @xmath131 settling down to a value in @xmath173 will be given by tr@xmath174 where @xmath175 is the projection operator @xmath176 if the initial state @xmath170 was pure , corresponding to a wavefunction @xmath177 , then the limit probability should be @xmath178 .",
    "as far as we are aware , a rigorous proof of this assertion is lacking , however it is well indicated for finite - dimensional systems with discrete eigenvalues , see for instance @xcite and @xcite ."
