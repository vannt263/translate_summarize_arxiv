    "this may safely be regarded as a lower limit , as simulations and other measurements suggest a higher asymptotic value for the gas mass fraction in clusters , f@xmath142 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while we only have observations at @xmath143 .",
    "assuming that a2029 contains proportions of dark matter and baryonic matter equal to their universal values , one may place an upper limit on @xmath138 with f@xmath144 . given the universal baryon mass density from big bang nucleosynthesis calculations and recent observations of the deuterium abundance ( @xmath145(bbn ) ) , one finds @xmath146 , where f@xmath147 is the universal baryon mass fraction .",
    "given @xmath148 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "massive elliptical galaxies such as ngc 720 @xcite , and ngc 4636 @xcite , are apparently dm - dominated all the way into their cores .",
    "this situation is likely to exist in a cd cluster such as a2029 , except at possibly the smallest scales ( @xmath153kpc ) , where the cd stellar mass component may be more important @xcite .",
    "we have found that the gas in a2029 is only a few percent of the total mass in the core of the system . but are we observing the stellar mass ( e.g. , the cd ) ?",
    "@xcite suggests the turnover between stellar and dm - domination should occur at a few tens of kpc ; but although we are specifically observing this regime , we see no significant break in the mass profile ( see  [ subsec_mass ] ) .",
    "the outlying fourth @xmath48 point and the central @xmath45 peak over a single @xmath5-model are intriguing , but the balance of the data suggest that any transition from stellar - dominated to dm - dominated regimes is quite smooth in this system .",
    "we have estimated the contribution of stellar matter to the system , by using optical observations of the cd galaxy in a2029 and its diffuse halo .",
    "@xcite conducted a detailed optical analysis of a2029 , and observed that the surface brightness of the cd+halo was well - fitted by a @xcite profile out to @xmath154 .",
    "they report a total @xmath155-band luminosity of @xmath156 for the cd+halo , which is 41% of the total light of the cluster within @xmath157 radius .",
    "we assume the cd+halo to be the vast majority of the light within its effective radius @xmath158 ( 76@xmath3  kpc ) . using the @xcite model as an approximate deprojection of the @xmath159 law",
    ", we normalize to the total light of @xcite , converting to our cosmology , and the @xmath160 band , and obtain a luminosity profile . in figure",
    "[ fig_ml ] , we present the total cluster mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath161 ) profile of the core of a2029 , based on the cd+halo light profile .",
    "it is consistent with a constant @xmath162 within 20@xmath3  kpc , and rises rapidly at larger radius .",
    "dynamical stellar analyses estimate the total masses of galactic systems , but can not directly measure the stellar mass .",
    "attempts to resolve this with population synthesis techniques yield highly uncertain results for the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "using these bounding values for @xmath164 we plot in figure [ fig_mass_compare ] ( right panel ) associated stellar mass profiles ( _ dot - dashed curves _ ) for the cd+halo system .",
    "the data indicate that at @xmath165 ( @xmath166@xmath3  kpc ) the stellar mass can potentially dominate the system , depending on the highly uncertain assumed @xmath164 . the stellar material outweighs the gas mass up to a radius between @xmath167 ( @xmath168@xmath3  kpc ) .",
    "if we assert a plausible value , @xmath169 for the system , we would conclude that the cluster is dm dominated down to the smallest scales measured here , which is consistent with a single nfw mass component ( and also with the lack of a significant break in the total mass profile ,  [ subsec_mass ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the gas density peak over the @xmath5-model at @xmath6@xmath3  kpc , or the outlying @xmath48 data point may indicate the presence of a stellar mass component in excess of ( or differing from ) an nfw dm halo .",
    "an interesting comparison can be made with the optical velocity dispersion profile of a2029 . as noted by @xcite , ic1101 ( the cd galaxy in a2029 )",
    "is one of the only brightest cluster galaxies observed to have an increasing velocity dispersion , @xmath170 , @xcite .",
    "we may regard the stars in the cd galaxy ( from which @xmath170 is measured ) to be simply another family of tracer particles ( as the hot icm gas particles ) bound to the same gravitational potential .",
    "thus , the effective velocity of the icm gas particles may be expected to mirror that of the stars .",
    "we estimate the velocity dispersion for the icm gas as @xmath171 .",
    "the temperature data yield @xmath172 , while the cd velocity dispersion profile of @xcite , measured over the range @xmath173  kpc reveals @xmath174 .",
    "this correspondence is not required for the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , but the similarity of the two species is striking .",
    "a2029 is one of the few systems where the shape of both the x - ray and optical velocity dispersions can be measured in detail : the consistency between them is further evidence that we are observing a dynamically relaxed system where all the mass components are in equilibrium with the gravitational potential .",
    "we have analyzed high spatial resolution _",
    "chandra _ data of the a2029 cluster of galaxies , obtaining well - constrained icm gas density and temperature profiles on scales of @xmath4 ( @xmath175@xmath3  kpc ) .",
    "fitting smooth functions to these profiles , we obtain mass profiles for a2029 , measuring the shape of the total mass profile at unprecedented accuracy to a very small fraction of the virial radius .",
    "our results are insensitive to most details of the data reduction , but are closely tied to the well - constrained temperature and density distributions .",
    "we find that the shape of the inferred dark matter density at @xmath31 is consistent with the nfw parameterization of cdm halos , but apparently incompatible with that of m99 , though we note that individual objects may be expected to show significant scatter from a mean dm halo profile @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the nfw model with the mass profile all the way down to @xmath19 indicates that there is no need to modify the standard cdm paradigm to fit the dm distribution in this cluster , consistent with x - ray observations of other clusters at larger radii ( see  [ subsec_dm ] ) .",
    "this result contrasts with the strong deviations from the cdm predictions observed in the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which inspired the self - interacting dm model @xcite to explain the relatively flat core density distributions in these galaxies .",
    "hence in light of the good agreement with the nfw profile in clusters , the deviations observed on small galaxy scales do not seem to imply a fundamental problem with the general cdm paradigm .",
    "instead , it is likely that the numerical simulations do not currently account properly for the effects of feedback processes on the formation and evolution of small halos .",
    "our analysis suggests that a2029 is dominated by a single mass ( i.e. , dm ) component at all measured scales below @xmath176 , or that any transition from a stellar mass dominated component in the cd and a dm component is quite gradual .",
    "we also observe a rising gas fraction from @xmath140 to @xmath177 in a2029 , obtaining an upper limit to @xmath178 , consistent with other current studies .                                                                          , m. , ponman , t.  j. , nulsen , p.  e.  j. , bautz , m.  w. , burke , d.  j. , david , l.  p. , davis , d. , donnelly , r.  h. , forman , w.  r. , jones , c. , kaastra , j. , kellogg , e. , kim , d .- w . ,",
