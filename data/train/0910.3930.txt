    "the motivations to study top quarks are manifold .",
    "the top quark can be used as a probe for new physics .",
    "top pair production process presents a dominant background to many new physics searches .",
    "finally , it will be a valuable tool for detector calibration at the lhc .",
    "establishing a top quark signal will be an important milestone in the atlas physics program .",
    "the results in this talk are based upon simulations with 14 center of mass energy . unless stated otherwise ,",
    "the studies presented here are documented in  @xcite .    in hadron collisions ,",
    "the top quark can be produced via either the strong ( @xmath0 ) or electroweak ( single top ) process .",
    "while the pair production was established at the tevatron in 1995 @xcite , @xcite , it took until 2009 to observe the electroweak process @xcite , @xcite .",
    "while at the lhc we expect to observe single top in a much shorter time frame , the initial focus will be on the @xmath0 process .",
    "the production cross section of top quark pairs increases from about 7  pb at the tevatron to about 900  pb ( @xmath1 ) or 400  pb ( @xmath2 ) at the lhc .",
    "for example , with 200   of integrated luminosity at 10 about 80k @xmath0 would be produced .",
    "another important consideration is that the production cross section of the dominant background , @xmath3jets , increases more slowly with energy than the signal cross section . that improves @xmath4 and makes the @xmath0 process easier to observe than at the tevatron .",
    "according to the standard model , the top quark decays almost exclusively into a @xmath5 quark and a @xmath6 boson .",
    "top quark pair decays are classified according to the decay modes of the two @xmath6 bosons into all hadronic , lepton+jets , and dilepton channels . in atlas",
    "the initial focus will be on decays that have either an electron or a muon from @xmath6 decay in the final state .",
    "such decays will be an important detector validation and calibration tool because they contain energetic jets , leptons , b - jets , and large missing transverse energy , allowing atlas subdetectors to be exercised .",
    "jet energy scale and b - jet identification efficiency can be calibrated using @xmath0 events .",
    "the lepton+jets channel has a relatively large branching fraction ( about 15% per flavor ) , and full kinematic information for the hadronic top quark is preserved , allowing for a mass peak reconstruction .",
    "the background in this channel may be relatively large , but it is dominated by one process , @xmath3jets .",
    "the dilepton channel has a much lower background .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath7 channel is that one can measure trigger efficiencies directly on @xmath0 events .",
    "but dilepton channels also have a much smaller branching fractions ( about 1% for @xmath8 , @xmath9 or 2% for @xmath10 ) , and more kinematic information is lost because of the two escaping neutrinos .",

    "we require either a `` medium '' electron , or a `` combined '' muon  @xcite .",
    "events in the muon+jets channel that were reconstructed correctly ( clear histogram ) , where a wrong jet combination was chosen ( cyan histogram ) , and non @xmath0 background ( yellow histogram at the bottom ) .",
    "the distributions are normalized to 100   at 14   .[fig : total_mjjj],width=302 ]    there are different methods to reconstruct the hadronically decaying top quark , that is , to determine which of the jets in the events are produced by decay products of that quark , in a @xmath0 event . the method used here",
    "is based on the fact that at the lhc top quarks are not produced at rest but have a non - zero @xmath17 .",
    "since qcd has no intrinsic mass scale , the average @xmath17 of an object is proportional to the mass of the object .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest standard model object , so we select the 3 jets that maximize @xmath18 as the daughters of the top , and treat the invariant mass of the three jet combination as the mass of the reconstructed top candidate .",
    "figure  [ fig : total_mjjj ] shows invariant mass spectra for correctly and incorrectly reconstructed signal events , and also the background contribution ( dominated by @xmath3jets ) .    after a 3-jet combination",
    "is assigned to a top quark , we apply an additional cut : at least one of the pairs of jets originating from the top quark should have an invariant mass compatible with that of the @xmath6 :    * @xmath19 + for a hadronic - top jet - pairing    the expected numbers of events in 100   at 14   for the signal and main backgrounds after the selection cuts are summarized in table  [ table : total_counts ] .",

    "atlas will have a rich top physics program .",
    "in addition , top pair events will provide valuable tool for detector validation and calibration . before exploring and exploiting properties of the top quark we need to observe it .",
    "a cross section measurement at a new center of mass energy is also an important physics result .",
    "this talk presented some of the methods that atlas will use to measure @xmath0 cross section in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels .",
    "it also outlined a new method of reconstructing @xmath0 events in the lepton+jets channel that is targeted to high mass resonances decaying into @xmath0 , and showed the expected sensitivity of the new method .",
