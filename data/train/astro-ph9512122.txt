    "for some time , it has been known that stars super - rich in lithium exist , with abundances much higher than they could have been endowed with at birth , i.e , larger than the present interstellar medium value",
    ". a much clearer understanding of these super - rich lithium stars was provided by the recent magellanic cloud observations of smith & lambert ( 1989 , 1990 ) , who obtained for the first time a luminosity range for lithium - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "they found that the most luminous agb stars were lithium - rich , in excellent agreement with the predictions of theoretical models of hot bottom burning ( sackmann , smith , & despain 1974 ; scalo , despain , & ulrich 1975 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1992 , 1995 , 1998 ) . hot bottom burning is predicted to occur occur only in the most massive agb stars ( between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , which are also the most luminous ones ( iben 1975 ; blcker & schnberner 1991 ; lattanzio 1992 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1992 , 1995 , 1998 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ; boothroyd , sackmann , & ahern 1993 ) .",
    "however , some lithium - rich stars do not fit into the above scenario .    during most of the evolution of a star ,",
    "lithium is destroyed , as it burns at relatively low temperatures . during the pre - main sequence phase",
    ", there can be significant lithium destruction for stars of masses @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , dantona & mazzitelli 1984 ; proffitt & michaud 1989 ; vandenberg & poll 1989 ; michaud & charbonneau 1991 ) . during the main sequence phase , considerable lithium destruction",
    "is observed in low mass stars ( @xmath9 ) , e.g. , by two orders of magnitude for the sun ; this is generally explained by rotation - induced slow mixing , with some diffusion ( see , e.g. , schatzman 1977 ; baglin , morel , & schatzman 1985 ; vauclair 1988 ; pinsonneault et al .",
    "1989 ; michaud & charbonneau 1991 ; proffitt & michaud 1991 ; charbonnel , vauclair , & zahn 1992 ; chaboyer , demarque , & pinsonneault 1995 ) , though part of this effect might possibly be due to early main sequence mass loss ( boothroyd , sackmann , & fowler 1991 ; swenson & faulkner 1992 ; whitmire et al .",
    "1995 ; guzik & cox 1995 ) . as stars approach the base of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the surface lithium abundance declines further by two orders of magnitude , as the deepening convective envelope reaches into lithium - depleted interior layers .",
    "thus rgb stars , and agb stars of @xmath10 , are expected to have surface lithium abundances from two to four orders of magnitude below the present interstellar medium value of @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 + 12 $ ] ) .",
    "in general , this is observed to be the case ; population  i red giants usually have lithium abundances lying in the range @xmath13 ( lambert , dominy , & sivertsen 1980 ; brown et al .  1989 ) .",
    "however , a few ( of order  1% ) of the red giants have been observed to have lithium abundances excess of the standard predictions ( brown et al .",

    "frequently , these lithium - rich red giants have large infrared excesses , interpreted as associated circumstellar dust shells .",
    "recently , de  la  reza et al .  ( 1997 ) discovered 20 new lithium - rich giants ( doubling the total number known ) by searching for lithium lines in giants with infrared excesses .",
    "these lithium - rich giants have not yet reached the agb , and at least some of them are observed to be low mass stars ; thus they can not have experienced creation via hot bottom burning .",
    "this presents a new puzzle , namely , how to explain such high lithium abundances in pre - agb stars .",
    "a related puzzle is presented by observations of field population  ii giants by pilachowski , sneden , & booth ( 1993 ) ; they find extra lithium _ depletion _ by large factors occurring on the rgb _ subsequent _ to first dredge - up .",
    "another problem concerns .",
    "it is well known that deuterium  ( d ) and are created in the big bang .",
    "stars burn their initial  d to while still on the pre - main sequence .",
    "low mass stars create pockets in their interior during main sequence burning , as first pointed out by iben ( 1967 ) , which will subsequently be dredged up to the surface on the rgb , and injected into the interstellar medium via stellar mass loss on the rgb and agb .",
    "recent measurements of mass fractions of  @xmath14 in the low - mass planetary nebulae ngc  3242 and ic  289 confirm that this does indeed occur in at least some stars ( galli et al .",
    "the sum of d+ in the interstellar medium was predicted to increase with time , due to this stellar processing .",
    "the observed solar ratio @xmath15 has thus been used as an upper bound on the primordial ratio , in order constrain big bang nucleosynthesis models ( see , e.g. , steigman 1985 ) ; it provides the strongest lower limit on the baryon to photon number ratio  @xmath16 , and thus to the baryon density of the universe  @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath19km@xmath20s@xmath21mpc@xmath22 ) .",
    "rood , bania , & wilson ( 1984 ) pointed out that the apparent observed trend with galactocentric radius of the abundances in regions was the opposite of what one would expect if the galactic abundance was increasing with time due to stellar processing .",
    "more recent data ( rood et al .  1997 ; bania et al .",
    "1997 ) show no significant trend of the abundance in regions as a function of either galactocentric radius or metallicity , with an average abundance of @xmath23 .",
    "some extragalactic measurements of deuterium have recently appeared ; a high ratio @xmath24 recently observed in a high - redshift ( @xmath25 ) absorption system in the quasar q0014 + 813 ( songaila et al .",
    "1994 ; carswell et al .",
    "1994 ; rugers & hogan 1996a ) has sparked new interest in deuterium and , since this observation implied a much larger primordial ( d+)/h value than had been inferred from the galactic observations .",
    "more recently , rugers & hogan ( 1996b ) measured @xmath26 in another absorber of q0014 + 813 ( at redshift @xmath27 ) . if the observed absorption lines do indeed correspond to deuterium and not some coincidental interloper cloud happening to lie at the corresponding velocity , then this leads to correspondingly lower values of  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 , close to the baryon density @xmath30 observed in stars and gas , eliminating the need for the existence of large amounts of baryonic dark matter .",
    "these observations also imply a decline by a factor of order  6 from the primordial ( d+)/h value to the presolar value .",
    "galactic chemical evolution models can obtain such a decline only if low mass stars destroy , instead of creating it ; even a _ low _ primordial d / h value tends to result in excessive amounts of   at the present epoch if stars create   ( see , e.g. , yang et al .",

    "[ figrgbt ] ) . during this time , the star s luminosity increases by only  60% ( sackmann",
    "et al .  1993 ) , so the assumption of static envelope structure is not unreasonable ( the luminosity increase is by a factor of  100 at the tip of the rgb , after a time @xmath76yr ) . for cbp in the `` evolving rgb '' circulation models , @xmath77 matched the above observed carbon isotope ratios on the rgb ( fig .",

    "in other words , _ under special conditions the cameron - fowler mechanism can work in low - mass , low - luminosity rgb stars_. the resulting envelope abundance is determined by the balance between being transported out ( to form  ) , and being transported back inwards ( and being destroyed ) .",

    "the destruction rate , however , still increases with increasing  @xmath78 ( since all transported down is burned ) , and the resulting envelope abundance decreases with increasing  @xmath78 . the value of @xmath153 which yields the maximum production depends on the temperature at the base of the circulation ( as may be seen from fig .",

[ figrgbevol]c ) .    figures  [ figrgbt ] and  [ figrgbevol ] show that the peak abundance can be attained prior to any significant enrichment , but that the abundance can remain high or even grow during the enrichment process .",
    "these preliminary models would thus predict that low mass super - rich lithium stars could occur with ratios throughout the range from @xmath111 to  @xmath6 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the observations presented by da  silva et al .",

    "lithium is created via the cameron - fowler mechanism , in which created via @xmath146 is transported out fast enough that its electron - capture to   can take place in cool regions , where the resulting can survive to enrich the stellar envelope .",
    "the amount of produced can exceed @xmath0 , but depends critically on the details of the extra mixing mechanism ( mixing speeds , geometry , episodicity ) ; it is _ independent _ of the previous history of the star .",
    "if the deep circulation is a long - lived , continuous process , lithium - rich rgb stars should be completely devoid of beryllium and boron .",
    "if it occurs in short - lived episodes , higher abundances might result , and beryllium and boron might be only partially destroyed .    \\4 . under some circumstances , cool bottom processing in low mass stars can produce _ super - rich _ lithium stars ( i.e. , abundances larger than the interstellar medium value ) , analogous to hot bottom burning in intermediate mass stars .",
    "for the interstellar medium , low mass stars might possibly be a significant source of  .",
    "cool bottom processing leads to destruction in low mass stars ; in contrast to the creation , the net depletion is largely independent of the details of the extra mixing mechanism .",
    "the overall contribution of solar - metallicity stars from 1 to @xmath1 is expected to be net destruction of  , with an overall survival fraction @xmath2 ( weighted average over all stellar masses ) ; this is in contrast to standard dredge - up theory , which would predict that stars are net producers of   ( with  @xmath3 ) . however , high measured abundances in a few planetary nebulae suggest that not all low mass stars experience cbp and depletion .",
    "population  ii stars should experience even more severe depletion than population  i stars ( @xmath4 ) , since they encounter more vigorous cool bottom processing due to their higher hydrogen - burning temperatures .",
    "this net destruction in stars would result in some relaxation of the upper bound on the primordial ( d+)/h abundance , but not by much ( see , e.g. , olive et al .",
    "1997 ; tosi et al .",
    "1998 )  high deuterium observations in quasars are still hard to accommodate , and only a slight relaxation is allowed on the lower bound on the cosmic baryon density  @xmath5 obtained from big bang nucleosynthesis calculations .",

    ", we also present the effects of standard first and second dredge - up on the helium , lithium , beryllium , and boron isotopes .",
    "the first dredge - up dilutions of , , , and   are typically by factors of @xmath116 , 30 , 10 , and 10 , respectively ; there is some evidence that extra mixing on the main sequence may result in larger dilution factors .",
    "there is also substantial destruction of by burning during first dredge - up for solar - metallicity stars of @xmath8 , and during second dredge - up for stars of @xmath99 .",
