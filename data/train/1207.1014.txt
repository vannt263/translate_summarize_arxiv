    "gmsb models set a restriction on the soft susy breaking trilinear @xmath19 parameter , @xmath20 at the messenger scale , which disallows maximal stop mixing , leading to the reduced upper limit on @xmath0 .",
    "if larger values of the sparticle masses are allowed within gmsb , the limit of 118 gev can be raised somewhat , but masses in excess of 2 tev , especially for the stops , would go against naturalness in the higgs mass , and would also render susy untestable at the large hadron collider . here",
    "we address the general question : how large can @xmath0 be in minimal gauge mediation without making sparticles beyond the reach of lhc ?",
    "we find that @xmath0 can be raised naturally to about @xmath21 gev , with susy particles all below 2 tev , if the messengers of susy breaking are allowed to mix with the standard model fields .",
    "such a scenario would make gmsb models compatible with the recent higgs observations .",

    "4 we discuss flavor violation arising from messenger ",
    "matter mixing in the two models .",
    "here we embed these models in a grand unification framework based on @xmath3 along with a flavor @xmath5 symmetry that addresses the quark and lepton mass and mixing hierarchies .",
    "5 has our conclusions . the relevant renormalization group equations ( rge ) for the two models are given in appendix a , and the gmsb boundary conditions for the mass parameters are derived in the appendix b. preliminary results of this work were presented at pheno 2011 @xcite .",
    "gmsb models are well motivated , since susy solves the hierarchy problem , and gauge mediation of susy breaking solves the susy flavor problem .",
    "these models also predict correctly the unification of the three gauge couplings , leading to an eventual embedding in a grand unified theory ( gut ) such as @xmath3 .",
    "gravity mediation of susy breaking ( sugra ) also shares these features , except that generically it would lead to excessive flavor changing processes mediated by the susy particles .",
    "consistency of sugra models with experiments would typically require two assumptions @xcite : ( i ) the soft masses of sparticles in any given sector are universal , and ( ii ) the trilinear @xmath22terms are proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "such assumptions are not necessary in gmsb models , rather they are automatic consequences .",
    "gmsb models assume that susy is dynamically broken in a secluded sector , and that this breaking is communicated to the mssm sector via the sm gauge interactions by a set of messenger fields which are charged under the sm .",
    "owing to the universality of the gauge interactions the soft susy breaking mass parameters would be flavor universal , and the induced @xmath22terms would be proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "minimal gauge mediation assumes that a gauge singlet superfield @xmath32 develops nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) along its scalar component @xmath33 as well as along its auxiliary component @xmath34 .",
    "this field couples to a set of messenger fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 which transform vectorially under the sm gauge symmetry : @xmath37 @xmath38 would split the masses of the scalars in @xmath35 from the corresponding fermions .",
    "this breaking of susy is communicated to the sm sector via loops involving the sm gauge bosons .",
    "the gaugino masses and the scalar masses for the mssm fields at the messenger scale are given by @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the dynkin index of the messenger pair @xmath35 with @xmath42 for @xmath43 of @xmath44 .",

    "@xcite , a flavor symmetry is assumed in the singlet ( @xmath32 ) sector , so that @xmath57 or @xmath58 can be realized at the messenger scale ( @xmath59 ) , depending on the assignment of flavor charges . in our analysis",
    "we shall allow for @xmath31 as well as @xmath60 at @xmath59 .",
    "a few features are worth emphasizing on eqs .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "sparticles of a given quantum number are all degenerate in mass , which is crucial in solving the susy flavor problem",
    ". the induced trilinear couplings would be proportional to the respective yukawa couplings owing to the vanishing of the @xmath22 terms , also crucial for solving the susy flavor problem .",
    "the minimal gmsb models also have only a small number of effective parameters .",
    "the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particles in minimal gmsb .",
    "its mass is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath63 is a typical yukawa coupling of the type @xmath64 given in eq .",
    "( [ sup ] ) .",
    "the cosmological requirement that the gravitinos do not overclose the universe requires @xmath65 kev @xcite , which in turn requires @xmath66 gev . in gmsb with a single set of messenger fields , @xmath67 , so that this constraint would require @xmath68 to obey @xmath69 gev ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 gev , its lowest allowed value , are used .",
    "perturbativity would require @xmath72 , so that cosmology prefers @xmath73 gev .",
    "since there are ways around the gravitino overclosure problem , such as by late decays of particles , or other ways of entropy dumping , the cosmological limit is not absolute . in our analysis we find fully consistent solutions when this limit is satisfied .",
    "we also allow @xmath59 to be greater than @xmath74 gev , as large as @xmath75 gev .",
    "any larger value would lead to @xmath76 gev , and thus generate supergravity contributions to the scalar masses that can bring back the susy flavor problem .",
    "the messenger fields , which are taken to be vector  like under the sm gauge symmetry , are usually assumed to form complete multiplets of a grand unified group .",
    "this is motivated by the observed meeting of the three gauge couplings at a scale near @xmath77 gev when extrapolated with the mssm spectrum .",
    "complete multiplets of a gut symmetry group such as @xmath3 would preserve this successful unification ( modulo small two  loop effects ) .",
    "messenger fields belonging to @xmath4 of @xmath3 or @xmath2 of @xmath3 are then the simplest choices .",
    "one could introduce multiple copies of these fields , or one could introduce both of them simultaneously .",
    "we shall consider only two minimal choices in this paper , viz .",
    ", having either one pair of @xmath4 or one pair of @xmath2 messenger fields .",
    "messenger fields belonging to @xmath4 of @xmath3 or @xmath2 of @xmath3 can mix with the mssm superfileds .",
    "if such mixings are written down arbitrarily , that would reintroduce susy flavor problem .",
    "however , in the context of an underlying flavor symmetry that addresses the mass and mixing hierarchy of quarks and leptons , it is not unreasonable to imagine that significant mixing of the messenger fields occurs only with the third family fermions .",
    "this is the situation we investigate in the next sections .",
    "complete separation of messenger fields from the mssm fields is in general problematic for cosmology , since this would lead to messenger number conservation and a stable messenger particle , which is not an ideal dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "matter mixing avoids this difficulty . in presence of such mixings , the expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ spectrum])-([ab ] ) for the soft susy breaking parameters would receive new contributions @xcite .",
    "this can help increase the lightest higgs boson mass of gmsb , and can lead to significantly different susy spectrum .",
    "we also point out that such mixings can modify the derived value of @xmath25 , which can now be quite low , in the range of @xmath78 , with order one yukawa couplings .",
    "low energy supersymmetry characteristically predicts one light higgs boson . in the mssm , at the tree level",
    ", the lightest higgs boson mass is bounded by @xmath79 .",
    "radiative corrections proportional to the top quark yukawa couplings shift this limit significantly @xcite . including the leading two loop corrections ,",

    "( [ higgsmass ] ) for interpretation .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath0 depends crucially on @xmath82 and the mixing parameter @xmath85 .",
    "it is maximal in the case of maximal stop mixing ( corresponding to @xmath86 ) , in which case @xmath87 gev can be realized with all susy particles below 2 tev .",

    "in such cases , near maximal mixing of the stops can be realized , as we show here , and thus the upper limit on @xmath0 can be raised to about @xmath21 gev .",
