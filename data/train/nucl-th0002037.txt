    "since hyperon - nucleon scattering experiments are difficult to perform , hyperon production processes such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 appear as natural candidates that allow exploring the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "one can obtain the information of the @xmath2 interaction by analyzing the correlated @xmath2 final states .",
    "an inclusive @xmath7 experiment has already been performed in hall c at tjnaf , while the data for @xmath8 are being analyzed in hall b.    recently , we found that various meson - theoretical @xmath2 interactions generate @xmath9-matrix poles around the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds@xcite .",
    "the pole near the @xmath11 threshold is related to the strength and the property of the @xmath12 coupling and causes enhancements in the @xmath10 elastic total cross sections .",
    "the hope is that the pole structure of the @xmath2 @xmath13 matrix will have visible effects in such production processes mention above .    in this paper",
    ", we study the inclusive @xmath14 and exclusive @xmath8 processes for @xmath15 and predict various observables including polarization observables .",
    "the reaction processes @xmath0 are expressed by the operator @xmath16 as @xmath17 where the operator @xmath18 describes the elementary processes @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represents the deuteron state which is generated by the nijmegen 93 @xmath21 interaction @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath22 corresponds to the @xmath2 final state interaction processes , and is represented as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is @xmath2 interaction including @xmath12 coupling .",
    "we ignore the @xmath25 meson interaction with the nucleon and hyperon in the final states . from eqs.([tmat1 ] ) and ( [ uij ] ) , one can deduce the coupled set of integral equations for @xmath16 , @xmath26 we solve this set ( [ tmat2 ] ) after partial - wave decomposition in momentum space .",
    "the three elementary process @xmath27 and @xmath28 are properly incorporated in the driving term in eq.([tmat2 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ tmat2 ] ) is solved on isospin bases @xmath10 and @xmath11 , but the resulting amplitudes are transformed into those on the particle bases @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 by which the inclusive @xmath32 , exclusive @xmath33 cross sections and hyperon polarizations are calculated . for details , we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .",
    "at present , we calculate the observables only for the @xmath25 meson scattered to 0 degree @xmath34 . the nijmegen soft - core @xmath2 interactions nsc97f@xcite and nsc89@xcite and a recently updated production operator@xcite for the @xmath35 processes are used .",
    "figure [ fsi1](a ) shows the inclusive cross sections which sum up the contributions of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 final states .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the predictions of the nsc97f and nsc89 @xmath2 interactions , respectively .",
    "the dotted line shows the results of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the two thresholds @xmath3 ( @xmath39 mev / c ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath40 mev / c ) .",
    "the two pronounced peaks around @xmath41945 and 809 mev / c are due to the quasi - free processes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where one of the nucleon in the deuteron is spectator and has zero momentum in the laboratory system .",
    "significant fsi effects are found around the @xmath3 and @xmath4 thresholds .",
    "the cross section is increased up to 86% by fsi near the @xmath3 threshold . around the @xmath4 threshold , as shown fig.[fsi1](b ) , the strengths and shapes of the enhancements by the nsc97f and nsc89 are quite different .",
    "figure [ expol1](a ) illustrates the exclusive @xmath44 cross sections just below the @xmath4 threshold ( @xmath45 mev / c ) .",
    "the fsi effects are seen both at very forward and at large angles .",
    "the pwia cross sections are basically zero at backward angles , while the fsi calculations still show some strength .",
    "figure [ expol1](b ) demonstrates the @xmath42 recoil polarizations with incoming polarized photon .",
    "the @xmath42 recoil polarizations in pwia are almost one .",
    "this is because the incoming photon is polarized along the @xmath46 axis , but the target deuteron is unpolarized and the outgoing @xmath25 meson carries no spin and angular momentum in this case ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , the final state interactions cause the large deviations from one , and the prediction by nsc97f is quite different from that of nsc89 .    the exclusive results to the @xmath38 final states just above this threshold ( @xmath41865 mev / c ) are shown in fig.[expol2 ] .",
    "the prominent fsi effects are seen both in the cross sections and in the double polarization observable .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the production operator for @xmath1 processes . in fig.[newold",
    "] , the inclusive cross sections in pwia in which an old version@xcite of the operator is used are compared to those with the present version@xcite .",
    "the latter has been improved in the fitting to the data of @xmath1 including the new saphir data .",
    "the difference between the predictions by the two versions are quite large as in fig.[newold ] , which suggests this reaction @xmath47 is another promising candidate for investigating the operator .",
