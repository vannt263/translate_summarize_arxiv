    "a variety of standard model extensions , such as grand unified models , strings and branes , models of extra dimensions and models utilising alternative schemes of electro - weak symmetry breaking , usually as an unbroken remnant of a larger gauge symmetry , include extra gauge bosons .",
    "current limits from direct searches at the lhc constrain their mass above @xmath11.1 - 1.7  tev , depending on their couplings  @xcite .",
    "the lhc is expected to explore the region of mass up to several tev .    in this study , we discuss the sensitivity of a high - energy @xmath2 collider to different models , containing extra neutral @xmath0 bosons , away from its centre - of - mass energy , @xmath3 .",
    "first , we briefly comment on the sensitivity to states at masses below @xmath3 with an `` auto - scan '' technique , which makes use of the luminosity spectrum tail due to radiation .",
    "then , we analyse electro - weak precision observables in @xmath4 processes for two reference models with @xmath5 .",
    "the first model is the so - called `` minimal @xmath0 '' @xcite , where new physics is at a very high energy scale and manifests itself at the tev scale through a single @xmath0 boson . in the second model  @xcite ,",
    "the higgs field and other fields , including three @xmath0s , are realised as composite states from a strong interaction at the tev scale . in the following we refer to this as the effective composite higgs model ( echm ) .",
    "these two models depict different physical situations and each represents one of the simplest realisations of the corresponding scenario , so they are well - suited to be used to test the collider sensitivity .",
    "in the sm , @xmath4 processes can be fully parametrised in terms of four helicity amplitudes , which can be in turn determined by measuring four observables : the total production cross section , @xmath6 , the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath7 , the left - right asymmetry , @xmath8 , and the polarised forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath9 .",
    "these observables still characterise the @xmath4 process if @xmath0 bosons are the only new neutral states .",
    "in fact , in the case of a single @xmath0 of known mass they can be used to determine the new vector couplings  @xcite . the anticipated experimental accuracy on these electro - weak observables for the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) processes are determined from the analysis of fully simulated and reconstructed @xmath10 events at @xmath3=3  tev using the ild detector model  @xcite , modified for physics at clic .",
    "beamstrahlung effects are taken into account but no machine - induced - backgrounds are overlayed . for polarised observables we assume 80% and 60% polarisation for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 beam , respectively .",
    "@xmath13-tagging is based on the response of the vertexing variables of the zvtop algorithm  @xcite .",
    "these characterise the kinematics and topology of the secondary system in a jet .",
    "they are supplemented by the corresponding kinematic observables for the secondary system based on particle impact parameters instead of topological vertexing , when the zvtop algorithm does not return any secondary vertex .",
    "this procedure allows us to increase the efficiency for @xmath13 jets at the higher end of the kinematic spectrum , which is particularly important in this analysis . tagging observables",
    "are combined into a single discriminating variable using the boosted decision tree procedure in the tmva package  @xcite . for this analysis",
    "we choose a working point corresponding to a full energy @xmath17 event tagging efficiency of 0.68 . for @xmath18 tagging ,",
    "events passing the @xmath13-tagging criteria are reconstructed as two - jet events and at least one of the jets is required to be compatible with the top quark mass .",
    "this gives an efficiency for full energy @xmath18 events of 0.55 .",
    "quark charge is determined using the lepton charge in @xmath13 and @xmath14 semileptonic decays , which is robust against the effect of machine - induced backgrounds , contrary to the case of jet or vertex charge techniques .",
    "in particular , for @xmath18 events we tag the top production using the hadronic decay of one top quark and determine the charge using the lepton from the @xmath19 decay in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "the electro - weak observables for the @xmath0 models and the sm are computed using calchep @xcite .",
    "the model files for the echm model are generated from the lagrangian using the feynrules @xcite package in mathematica  @xcite , and its couplings calculated by implementing an external c library to obtain a numerical diagonalisation of the mass matrices .",
    "calchep matrix elements are obtained at tree level and corrections from initial state radiation ( isr ) and beamstrahlung are added .",
    "isr is implemented using the formalism of  @xcite .",
    "these calculations include a few event selection cuts .",
    "first , a cut on the polar angle of the final state fermions , @xmath20 , ensures their observability in the detector .",
    "then , a cut on the final state energy , @xmath21 , selects high energy events .",
    "this removes the effect of radiation and brings the visible cross - section for the process down to its born cross section value as shown in figure  [ fig : isr ] .     in the sm at the born level ( solid line ) , with isr and beamstrahlung and no cuts ( dotted line ) , and with isr , beamstrahlung and the cut @xmath21 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the cut selects final state fermions which did not experience significant energy radiation , bringing the cross - section back within @xmath22 of its born - level value.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "if a new neutral resonance were to be observed at the lhc it would become extraordinarily interesting to produce it in lepton collisions and accurately determine its properties and nature .",
    "a multi - tev @xmath2 collider , such as clic , is very well suited for such a study . by precisely tuning the beam energies to perform a detailed resonance scan",
    "the parameters of the resonance can be extracted with high accuracy  @xcite . operating clic at its full design energy of 3  tev it will also be possible to search for new resonances coupled to @xmath2 and perform a first determination of their mass and width using the beamstrahlung and isr tail through an `` auto - scan '' without changing its beam energy .",
    "channel by auto - scan with 1  ab@xmath23 of data at 3  tev .",

    "the masses can be determined with 1  ab@xmath23 data to ( 1588.7@xmath273.5 )  gev and ( 2022.6@xmath271.2 )  gev , i.e.  with a statistical accuracy of just a few per - mil , or better , by operating the collider always at the maximum @xmath3 energy .      in case",
    "no signal is observed at the lhc , a multi - tev @xmath2 could still obtain essential information on extra gauge bosons by a precision study of electro - weak observables , sensitive to the effects of new particles at mass scales well above @xmath3 . here",
    ", we consider two different scenarios with heavy @xmath0 bosons . besides the so - called sequential standard model ( ssm ) and",
    "the @xmath28-inspired models , which have been already extensively studied  @xcite , there is a more general and model - independent parametrisation of a @xmath0 boson and its couplings , as proposed in  @xcite , generally referred to as `` minimal '' @xmath0 model .",
    "its phenomenology at lhc has been recently studied in detail  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption in the model description is the presence of a single new vector boson state with a mass of order tev plus the _ minimal amount _ of extra non - sm fields needed to make the model renormalisable and free of anomalies . before mixing",
    ", the coupling of the @xmath0 to fermions can be written as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the standard @xmath31 coupling , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the usual hypercharge , baryon and lepton numbers .",
    "the effects from the most general kinetic and mass mixing can be described in terms of two independent couplings of the @xmath0 to fermions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which induce @xmath37 mixing .",
    "several of the well - known @xmath0 models considered earlier on can be incorporated in this framework by fixing the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "the deviations of the electro - weak observables in the @xmath39 channel are shown in figure  [ fig : zmin ] , for the case of the b - l model  @xcite .     in the @xmath0 minimal model , for parameters corresponding to the b - l model , at @xmath3=3  tev .",

    "this model aims at explaining the fermion mass hierarchy and to stabilise the higgs sector .",
    "it describes the sm fields and their first kk composite excitations as a result of two sectors , elementary and composite , which are mixed . in the neutral sector , there are three heavy @xmath0s .",
    "their couplings are controlled by composite - elementary mixing angles , which are generation - dependent . in this phenomenological analysis",
    "we have assume universal new vector boson mass parameter @xmath48 and composite gauge coupling @xmath49 . in order to study the modifications of the standard four - fermion operators from @xmath0 exchanges",
    ", we also assume that the composite fermions have an universal mass scale , @xmath50 , which is taken to be greater than @xmath48 by fixing @xmath51 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath48 is the only relevant mass scale in study of the electro - weak observables . in the yukawa / fermion mixing sector ,",
    "we have assumed full @xmath52 compositeness  @xcite while fermions other than the quarks of the @xmath53 generation are taken to be mostly elementary .",
    "our phenomenological analysis has three free parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath54 , where the latter is the yukawa coupling in the composite fermion sector related to the top mass .",
    "due to the relatively strong experimental constraints on the @xmath55 coupling , the @xmath13 quark couplings to the three heavy neutral vectors must be taken to be lower than those of the sm , while those of the @xmath14 are enhanced .",
    "the main signature of this model is in the large deviations of the top sector observables from their sm expectations .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : echm ] , where the deviations of the electro - weak observables in the @xmath56 and @xmath18 final states from their sm values are shown as a function of @xmath48 .    , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath41 observables in the echm model at @xmath3=3  tev .",

    "we estimate the sensitivity of our observable to these @xmath58 models in terms of the region in parameter phase space where the electro - weak observables have values incompatible with their sm predictions . here",
    "we use nine of the electro - weak observables , i.e.  production cross section , @xmath6 , forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath7 , and left - right asymmetry , @xmath8 , for the @xmath56 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 final states .",
    "we perform flat scans of the parameter space of each model on a grid and for each scan point we compute the pulls , given by the differences between the actual model point values from their sm values normalised to the measurement accuracy estimated from simulation .",
    "the sensitivity to a model is defined as the region of parameters where the @xmath59 probability for the nine electro - weak observables to be compatible with the sm prediction is below 0.05 . as highlighted by the previous studies , @xmath2 collider data are generally sensitive to mass scales which larger than the @xmath3 value by a factor varying from a few times to an order of magnitude , which pushes the typical sensitivity of a multi - tev collider well beyond the direct accessibility of any realistic particle collider .",
    "results for the @xmath58 minimal model and the echm model are shown in figure  [ fig : zpminex ] .",
    "they confirm that level of sensitivity for the two models studied here with a range of sensitivity varying between few tev to 30  tev and beyond , depending on the couplings for the @xmath58 minimal model and around 16  tev for the echm model . in this case",
