    "we refer to the nw and se jets as the _ main _ and _ counter-_jets , as the former is brighter at most distances from the nucleus .",
    "a striking feature of the main jet is its almost constant width between @xmath1100 and @xmath1400  arcsec from the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i5.5full ] ) .",
    "this is the _ collimation shoulder",
    "_ identified by @xcite ; a similar feature is visible in the counter - jet , but can not be traced out as far .",
    "the lack of expansion over such an extended region is surprising if the jets are confined solely by thermal plasma associated with the surrounding galaxy group , as a significant pressure gradient would be expected on scales of a few hundred arcsec ( we argue in section  [ rmorigin ] that the core radius of the group - scale plasma is @xmath1225  arcsec ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the jets also respond to the @xmath17 forces of their own toroidal fields on scales @xmath18100arcsec . in section  [ field ] , we show that the observed polarization structure is consistent with a dominant toroidal component ( see also @xcite ) , but we can not tell from the high - frequency synchrotron emission alone whether this component is vector - ordered or has many reversals ( evidence from faraday rotation is also inconclusive ; see section  [ rmorigin ] ) .",
    "the possibility that both pressure confinement and magnetic confinement could act together to produce a collimation shoulder was discussed by @xcite , but they assumed rather different physical parameters from those we now consider appropriate for ngc315 .",
    "our observations show that the collimation shoulder in the main jet ends at a bright feature with a sharp edge on the side towards the nucleus , inclined by @xmath160@xmath4 to the jet axis . at this point ( marked `` deflection '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : i5.5full ] ) , the flow changes direction by @xmath18@xmath4 and re - expands with an opening angle @xmath110@xmath4 ( defined in terms of the jet fwhm and the angular distance from the nucleus ; @xcite ) . at a similar distance ,",
    "the counter - jet does not deflect significantly , its surface brightness decreases monotonically away from the nucleus and it expands less rapidly than the main jet ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "[ fig : ilow]b ) .",
    "the brightness distributions in both jets show large - scale `` banding ''  repeated , but irregular alternation of bright and faint regions with surface brightnesses differing by factors of 1.5 to 2  along their lengths on arcminute scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i5.5full ] ) .",
    "the brightness bands extend across both jets but their variations are slower than those in the flaring region or at the edges of the jets . these variations could , in principle , result either from periods of enhanced activity in the nucleus or from interactions between the jets and their surroundings .",
    "if they were due to fluctuations in activity in the nucleus that propagated outwards at constant velocity @xmath19 , then they would appear at projected distances @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the main and counter - jets , respectively , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 38@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "any transverse velocity gradients or deceleration will complicate this expression and the former effect should distort the bands into arcs that are concave towards the nucleus .",
    "we see no obvious relation between the distances of the bands in the two jets for any plausible value of @xmath24 and no evidence for systematic concave curvature of the bands beyond the flaring region .",
    "furthermore , the most prominent banding appears to be associated with regions where the jets deflect or change their collimation properties .",
    "it therefore seems more likely that the banding is associated with ongoing interactions between the jets and their surroundings , although we can not rule out a contribution to large - scale brightness fluctuations from slow variations in the jet output .",
    "the remarkable 180@xmath4 bend in the main jet at the west end of the source is well known from earlier observations .",
    "our data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ilow]b ) show the emission after the bend at a resolution comparable to the 610-mhz wsrt image presented by @xcite .",
    "the brightness distribution at the first part of the bend ( where the jet deflects by @xmath1100@xmath4 ) shows complex structure at 5.5-arcsec resolution .",
    "a bright ridge runs along the outside edge , with a lane of reduced emission next to it ( both features are labelled on fig .",
    "[ fig : ibend ] ) .",
    "note that the suggestion that the flow is re - energised by an intergalactic shock @xcite applies to emission further downstream , after the second bend .",
    "the compact knot of emission at the sw edge of the jet just before the bend ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ibend ] ) coincides in location and shape with the optical emission from the flattened background galaxy fgc 0110 ( z = 0.021965 ) and appears not to be physically related to ngc315 .",

    "30 22 44.99 ( j2000 ; labelled `` background source '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : i2.35]a ) is unresolved and has a flat spectrum .",
    "the polarized flux density and @xmath25-vector position angle vary smoothly across this position , consistent with addition of an unpolarized point source to the jet emission .",
    "there is a faint optical counterpart on the digital sky survey and an x - ray point source is detected at a consistent position with the _ rosat _ pspc ( @xcite ; fig .  2 ) .",
    "the source is likely to be a background quasar , despite its location on the projected jet axis .",
    "there is a strong , diffuse component of emission on the axis of the main jet ( `` on - axis enhancement '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : i2.35]a ) at @xmath1225arcsec from the nucleus , with no obvious counterpart in the counter - jet .",
    "the 2.35-arcsec resolution images illustrate the initial flaring of the jets ( discussed in detail by @xcite and worrall et al .",
    ", in preparation ) followed by recollimation to an almost uniform diameter @xcite .",
    "although similar behaviour is observed in other sources @xcite , the physical scale on which ngc315 flares and recollimates is unusually large .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the low external density @xcite , and we will explore this idea quantitatively elsewhere , using the conservation - law approach developed by @xcite . the jets in ngc315 bend slightly as they recollimate , from a position angle of @xmath26 close to the nucleus to @xmath27 at distances @xmath18100arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "the outer isophotes of the main and counter - jets are very similar before the bend , but the counter - jet is slightly wider at larger distances . the main jet is brighter than the counter - jet _ on - axis _ at all distances from the nucleus , but the counter - jet is brighter at the _ edge _ between @xmath1100 and 200arcsec . in the flaring region , by contrast , the main jet is significantly brighter than the counter - jet both on - axis and at the edge of the jet @xcite .",
    "we successfully fit the structure of the inner @xmath270arcsec of the jets in ngc315 using an intrinsically symmetrical model in which all apparent differences between the main and counter - jets result from relativistic aberration and beaming @xcite .",
    "such models clearly can not be continued to indefinitely large scales , as fri jets almost always show evidence ( e.g.bends and disruption ) for asymmetric interaction with the external medium .",
    "the largest - scale structure of ngc315 shown in fig .  [ fig : ilow](a ) is an excellent example , with jets of unequal length terminating in entirely different ways .",
    "this raises the question : how large is the region over which symmetrical , relativistic models can be applied ? at 400  arcsec from the nucleus , there are clear asymmetries in both the deflection and collimation properties ; these must be intrinsic , although the overall brightness asymmetry persists .",
    "there is also good evidence for interaction with the external medium at distances of 70 ",
    "100arcsec on both sides of the nucleus , where both jets bend ( symmetrically , this time ) .",
    "it seems likely that intrinsic and relativistic effects become comparable between 100 and 200  arcsec , where the sidedness difference on - axis is the same as on small scales , but the edge value is reversed .",
    "asymmetries in apparent magnetic - field structure , which also imply that the flow remains mildly relativistic in this region , are discussed in section  [ field ] .",
    "our working hypothesis is therefore that relativistic effects dominate the observed differences between the two jets only before the first bends , but that environmental effects become first comparable and then dominant at larger distances , although slightly relativistic bulk flow probably continues to the largest scales and may remain responsible for the generally brighter appearance of the nw jet far from the nucleus .",
    "we define spectral index @xmath11 in the sense @xmath28 .",
    "we estimated spectral indices both for individual pixels and by integration of flux density over well - defined regions .",
    "values at 5.5-arcsec resolution were determined from weighted power - law fits to data at all five frequencies between 1.365 and 5ghz . at 1.5-arcsec resolution , spectral indices were calculated between 1.413 and 5ghz .",
    "there are three main sources of error in the estimate of @xmath11 , as follows .    1 .   the transfer of the amplitude scale from the primary calibrator .",
    "the errors for the four l - band frequencies are likely to be tightly correlated , since they were observed during the same periods , data being taken simultaneously at 1365 and 1413mhz , and at 1485 and 1665mhz . consequently , the principal effect of flux - density scale transfer errors is a constant offset in spectral index .",
    "2 .   residual deconvolution effects , typically on scales of 5  20arcsec .",
    "these are approximately proportional to surface brightness .",
    "3 .   thermal noise .",
    "we model the error from ( ii ) as 0.03 times the flux density and that from ( iii ) as the noise level estimated off - source ( from table  [ noise ] ) , appropriately integrated .",
    "these two contributions are added in quadrature .",
    "in addition , we estimate the rms spectral - index offset due to transfer errors in the flux - density scale to be 0.02 .",
    "this should be taken in addition to the errors quoted below .",
    "figs  [ fig : spec](a ) and ( b ) show the spectral indices , @xmath11 , determined from a weighted power - law fit to data at all five frequencies between 1.365 and 5ghz at 5.5arcsec resolution and between 1.413 and 5ghz at a resolution of 1.5arcsec , respectively .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : spec](a ) that there are transverse gradients in spectral index where the jets are expanding rapidly .",
    "these gradients can only be see clearly on spectral - index images where the errors are small , and for this reason both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] are blanked where the rms error in @xmath11 is @xmath29 . in order to search for transverse variations over a larger area",
    ", we need to average along the jets .",
    "the gradients between 34.5 and 69arcsec from the nucleus are best displayed by averaging along radii from the nucleus and plotting the results against angle from the local jet axis , as is shown for the main and counter - jets in fig .",
    "[ fig : transspec_radial](a ) . further from the nucleus , where the jets recollimate , we have averaged along the local jet axis to derive transverse spectral - index profiles .",
    "the results are shown for two regions in each of the main and counter - jets in fig .",
    "[ fig : transspec_long ] . the fluctuations in these regions",
    "are dominated by quasi - periodic deconvolution errors : this problem is particularly acute for the counter - jet at @xmath30100arcsec from the nucleus ( fig .",

    "the spectral index is everywhere consistent with the mean value of @xmath31 between 70 and 160arcsec .",
    "another method of displaying spatial variations of the spectrum is `` spectral tomography '' @xcite .",
    "this involves the generation of a set of images @xmath32 for a range of values of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the brightness at position @xmath35 and frequency @xmath15 .",
    "if the brightness distribution can be represented as the sum of two components with different spectral indices @xmath36 , then the `` a '' component will disappear from the image @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",

    "the mean values at 5.5-arcsec resolution are 0.63 and 0.58 in the main and counter - jets , respectively ( the difference between them is not significant ) .",
    "3 .   at 1.5 arcsec resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec]b ) , the spectral index of the main jet is essentially constant for the first @xmath115arcsec , with a mean spectral index @xmath53 , consistent with the value determined at lower resolution .",
    "4 .   between @xmath115 and 70 arcsec from the nucleus ,",
    "the spectral index is steeper on - axis ( @xmath54 ) than at the edges ( @xmath55 ) in both jets .",
    "this is illustrated by the transverse profiles averaged between 34.5 and 69arcsec from the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transspec_radial]a ) .",
    "5 .   at 1.5-arcsec resolution ,",
    "the on - axis spectral index is slightly higher between 15 and 60arcsec from the nucleus ( @xmath56 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : spec]b ) than at smaller distances .",
    "@xmath11 can not be determined to adequate accuracy at the edges of the jet for distances @xmath1815arcsec at this resolution .",
    "the tomographic analysis shows the spectral gradient in a different way : if we subtract off a component with @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_tomo ] ) , the emission at the edges of the jet and at large distances from the nucleus essentially vanishes . what remains ( positive in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_tomo ] ) corresponds to the jet bases and to a ridge of steeper - spectrum emission at larger distances .",
    "the latter is clearly visible in both jets .",
    "the flatter - spectrum edge first becomes detectable at @xmath115arcsec from the nucleus and widens thereafter .",
    "it occupies the entire width of the jet from @xmath170arcsec outwards .",
    "the transition between steeper and flatter spectrum on - axis is poorly defined .",
    "there is no evidence for any transverse spectral gradient at larger distances , after the jets recollimate , although the data are noisy and do not cover quite the full width of the jets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transspec_long ] ) . 9 .",
    "this is confirmed by the tomographic analysis : @xmath37 for the outer parts of the region vanishes for @xmath57 , the mean spectral index , confirming that @xmath11 is constant within our errors .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the spectral index of an _ on - axis _ component in a jet is the value of @xmath33 at which the component appears to vanish against the background of the surrounding emission ( exactly as for an _ edge _ component such as that in the ngc315 jets ; section  [ tomography ] ) and can therefore be derived simply from a tomographic analysis .",
    "this requires an additional assumption which may not be correct , namely that when the the on - axis component is subtracted , the remaining emission has a smooth brightness distribution ( this is _ not _ true for the model proposed below ) . for ngc315",
    ", our three - dimensional model of the emissivity @xcite gives a good fit to the observed emission at 5ghz , so we isolated the on - axis component and measured its spectral index , as follows .    1 .",
    "we first used the tomography image with @xmath42 as a template for the on - axis component . to a reasonable approximation , this defines a cone with a half - opening angle of 13.6@xmath4 projected on the sky . assuming an angle to the line of sight of @xmath58 @xcite , the half - opening angle in the jet frame is @xmath59 .",
    "we then made a model 5-ghz image , as in @xcite but with the emissivity set to zero within this cone , convolved it to a resolution of 5.5 arcsec and subtracted it from the observed 5-ghz @xmath48 image .",
    "the residual corresponds to the observed emission from within the central cone .",
    "3 .   we scaled the model to 1.365ghz assuming a spectral index of 0.44 , as appropriate for the edge emission and then subtracted it from the observed 1.365-ghz image .",
    "both residual images showed little emission towards the edges of the jets , implying that the model subtraction was reasonably accurate .",

    "has @xmath153 0.44 and is associated with a region where strong shear is inferred @xcite .",
    "we speculate that two different acceleration mechanisms are involved , one associated with fast flow , dominant close to the nucleus and capable of accelerating electrons to the very high energies required to produce x - ray emission ( @xmath154 ) , the other being driven by shear and generating the flatter spectral indices seen at the edges of the jet .",
    "both mechanisms must efficiently generate the electrons with @xmath155 which radiate at cm wavelengths . at distances",
    "@xmath1870arcsec , the spectral index is consistent with @xmath156 everywhere .",
    "we have imaged the variations of faraday rotation over the jets .",
    "all of the rotation is resolved and must originate mostly in foreground material .",
    "there is no detectable depolarization . the largest contributions ",
    "a constant term and a linear gradient  are probably galactic in origin .",
    "we have also detected residual fluctuations of @xmath11  2 radm@xmath3 rms on scales @xmath30 5  100arcsec .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations on scales @xmath1830arcsec is larger by a factor @xmath12 for the counter - jet , consistent with an origin in magnetoionic material around the source , but not in the known x - ray - emitting halo , whose core radius is too small .",
    "we model the faraday - rotating medium as a spherical halo with a core radius @xmath1225arcsec and derive an approximate value for the product @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the central density , @xmath159 the central magnetic field and @xmath124 is the magnetic - field correlation length .",
    "our analysis is therefore consistent with models of faraday rotation proposed for rich clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but requires much lower densities and field strengths .",
    "we predict that a tenuous , group - scale halo should be detectable in sensitive x - ray observations ; measurement of its density will allow us to estimate the magnetic - field strength .",
    "we have derived the apparent magnetic field direction ( corrected for faraday rotation ) and degree of polarization at distances between 70 and 160arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "the structure is qualitatively similar to that seen in the flaring region , with transverse field on - axis and longitudinal field at the edges of both jets , but the degree of polarization on - axis is larger .",
    "the difference in polarization structure between the main and counter - jets observed in the flaring region by @xcite persists at larger distances .",
    "this can be explained fully as an effect of differential aberration on radiation from intrinsically identical jets , as long as their velocities remain significantly relativistic on the relevant scales .",
    "the asymmetry in rm fluctuation amplitude is consistent with the jet orientation required by this analysis and the presence of a tenuous , magnetized group halo .",
    "the large angular size of the flaring region in ngc315 and our use of deep observations at several frequencies has allowed us to image spectral variations at a level of detail not yet achieved in any other jet . taken together with x - ray imaging and modelling of the jet velocity field , this has given important insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether our results apply to other fri jets and to study the spectral variations in ngc315 over a wider frequency range .",
