    "lattice calculations provide a unique first principle approach to the thermodynamics of qcd .",
    "they have the potential to produce definitive answers for basic bulk thermodynamic properties as well as the phase diagram of qcd . to reach this ambitious goal one has to control lattice discretization errors that lead to systematic deviations of lattice calculations from continuum physics , as well as finite volume effects that that can obscure the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we present here results from a detailed analysis of the transition temperature in qcd with an almost physical value of the strange quark mass and several values of the light quark mass .",
    "this allows to perform an extrapolation to the chiral limit as well as to the physical point .",
    "calculations have been performed for two different values of the lattice cut - off which allows to estimate the lattice discretization errors and perform an extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "the flavor dependence of these results are examined through an analogous analysis of qcd with three degenerate quark flavors .",
    "we also report on results from an ongoing study of the qcd equation of state with almost physical light and strange quark masses .",
    "all these calculations have been performed with an @xmath0 tree - level improved gauge action and an improved staggered fermion action ( p4fat3 ) that also improves bulk thermodynamic observables at @xmath0 . for further details on the calculational",
    "set - up we refer to @xcite .",
    "in order to determine the transition temperature and its dependence on the light quark mass we have performed calculations with a fixed value of the bare strange quark mass and several ( degenerate ) values for the two light quark masses that correspond to light pseudo - scalar masses ( @xmath1 ) ranging from @xmath2  mev to @xmath3  mev . for non - zero values of the quark",
    "masses the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd is signaled by peaks in response functions .",
    "we have analyzed polyakov loop and chiral susceptibilities to locate the transition point for the different quark mass values on lattices with temporal extent @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the spatial extent of the lattice has been varied between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we generally observe only a weak volume dependence of the transition point and also find that the above susceptibilities as well as quark number susceptibilities in the light and strange quark sector @xcite yield , within statistical errors , consistent results for the transition point .    in order to convert the results for the transition temperature to physical values one needs to set the scale through the calculation of zero temperature observables .",
    "unlike hadronic observables in the light quark sector , which require a careful handling of chiral extrapolations , are known to be difficult to determine and in some cases are influenced by large discretization errors , the parameters of the static quark potential have been found to show only a mild dependence of the lattice cut - off @xcite .",
    "we thus have performed extensive studies of the static quark potential , @xmath8 , on zero temperature lattices and extracted the scale parameter @xmath9 defined through the slope of @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 . using the results obtained for @xmath9 in lattice units at the crossover couplings , which have been determined in finite temperature simulations on lattices with temporal extent @xmath11 and @xmath5 , the transition temperatures",
    "can then be calculated as @xmath12 .",
    "results for @xmath13 and the static quark potential in units of @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] . results for @xmath13 have then been extrapolated to the continuum limit using an ansatz that incorporates the quark mass dependence of @xmath14 through the calculated values of the lightest pseudo - scalar mass as well as a quadratic dependence on the lattice cut - off , @xmath15 here @xmath16 has been varied between @xmath17 and @xmath18 to allow for uncertainties in the extrapolation to the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "the continuum extrapolation is shown as the lower curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](left ) . for the transition temperature at the physical point",
    "we find , @xmath19 where we have used @xmath20  fm @xcite to set the scale for @xmath14 .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed for qcd with three degenerate quark masses @xcite . in this case",
    "the transition becomes first order for small but non - zero values of the quark mass .",
    "we find for the transition temperature in the chiral limit @xmath21 while in the same limit the transition temperature in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd is @xmath22 .",
    "we note that @xmath23 in 3-flavor qcd is about 5% smaller than in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd .",
    "moreover , the difference between the transition temperature in the chiral limit and at the physical point is only about 3% .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the weak quark mass dependence of the transition temperature , which has been observed earlier @xcite .",
    "a similarly weak quark mass dependence has also been observed in studies performed with another version of an improved staggered fermion action ( asqtad ) on lattices with temporal extent @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this analysis , however , lead to a 10% smaller transition temperature , @xmath26 than the value reported here . to resolve the origin of this discrepancy needs further investigations .",

    "this is in contrast to calculations performed with a variant of standard staggered fermions @xcite which unlike p4fat3 and asqtad actions lead to large cut - off distortions of the high - t limit on lattices with temporal extent @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". we also note that we find no evidence for a significant broadening of the transition region when going closer to the continuum limit .",
