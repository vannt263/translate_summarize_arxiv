    "the contact interaction occupies a special position in quantum mechanics .",
    "the system with contact interaction is often rigorously solvable @xcite , and also is useful in examining the effect of small obstacle on particle motion .",
    "the first influential work on contact interactions was done by kronig and penney @xcite .",
    "the model , which has potential consisting of a periodic array of @xmath0 functions , has been widely regarded as a standard reference model in the solid - state physics for more than half a century .    in spite of the seeming simplicity of contact interactions ,",
    "there are several non - trivial aspects which are largely left unexplored . even in the simplest setting of one dimension ,",
    "there has been a historically longstanding problem of realizing the generalized contact interaction in the small - size limit of a local self - adjoint interaction . in one dimension",
    ", there are a four - parameter family of generalized contact interactions which conserve the current at both sides of the interaction @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the one - dimensional kinetic energy operator @xmath1 with domain @xmath2 has deficiency indices @xmath3 @xcite . in non - relativistic formalism , the current operator is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is defined in terms of the wave function @xmath6 and its space derivative as @xmath7 the matrix @xmath8 in eq.([eq1 - 1 ] ) is the second component of pauli matrices ; @xmath9 in eq.([eq1 - 2 ] ) , @xmath10 is the mass of a particle .",
    "if we put a contact interaction at @xmath11 , the connection of @xmath5 between both sides of the origin can be characterized by @xmath12 where the current conservation @xmath13 requires @xmath14 the generic solution of eq.([eq1 - 5 ] ) is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the @xmath19 potential induces such a boundary condition that the wave function has continuous first derivative on the right and left , but it has a jump proportional to the first derivative @xcite ; @xmath21 in @xcite , we have constructed the @xmath19 potential in the small distance limit of three nearby @xmath0 potentials and realized in terms of usual @xmath0 and @xmath19 potentials a three - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions under the assumption of time reversal symmetry .",

    "also , the relativistic origin of @xmath19 potential has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "contrary to the general belief , some of the non-@xmath0 contact interactions appears in realizable settings in quite a natural manner @xcite , and , in fact , they are essential in understanding the nature of one - dimensional many - body system @xcite .    in light of these facts , it is quite interesting to examine the nature of one - dimensional system with a periodic array of generalized contact interactions . for this purpose",

    "it will be shown that the standard periodic array of @xmath0 potentials has a specific band structure , compared to the generic cases ; the band gap tends to disappear in the high energy limit for periodic @xmath0 array , while the band width becomes narrower for higher bands in generic cases .",
