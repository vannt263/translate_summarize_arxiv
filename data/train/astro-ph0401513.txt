    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have proven extremely useful as standardizable candles to explore the expansion history of the universe  @xcite .",
    "ambitious follow - on experiments are just starting , snls  @xcite , essence  @xcite , or have been planned , snap  @xcite , to extend the revolutionary result that the universe is accelerating to precise statements about the constituents and history of the universe .",
    "however , a key assumption underlying these experiments is that the current observed diversity in sne  ia will be well - behaved and calibrated to allow for the desired precision measurements",
    ". this assumption can be tested in large part using nearby sne  ia .",
    "moreover , there is the possibility for such nearby studies to uncover new relationships that will make sne  ia even better standard candles , much as the width - luminosity relation has brought sne  ia to their already impressive level of standardization .    the nearby supernova factory ( snfactory ) project is designed to bring this improved understanding of sne  ia  @xcite . over the course of three years , it will study 300  sne  ia in the nearby smooth hubble flow .",
    "these sne will be observed with a dedicated instrument , the supernova integral field spectrograph ( snifs ) , which is currently in the final stages of construction .",
    "snifs will provide simultaneous spectrophotometric coverage of both the sn and the host galaxy at 35  day intervals during the rise and fall of each sn .",
    "this unprecedented dataset will provide a wealth of information on sne ia and allow for an improved calibration of sne  ia for use in cosmology .",
    "the snfactory searches for sne using wide - field images obtained in collaboration with the near earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) group  @xcite at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) . in their quest for asteroids",
    ", the neat group observes hundreds of fields each night by taking three images of each field , spaced fifteen to thirty minutes apart , and searching for objects that move by more than a couple of arcseconds over this period .",
    "the snfactory uses this temporal spacing to eliminate asteroids and reduce cosmic - ray contamination .",
    "the neat observing program covers the observable sky from @xmath1 to @xmath2 degrees in declination every one to two weeks .",
    "since 2001 , the palomar 1.2-m .",
    "oschin telescope has been used by the snfactory - neat collaboration .",
    "the neat group outfitted this telescope with an automated system for control and observations and added a 3-chip , 3  field - of - view ccd camera ( neat12gen2 ) at the spherical focal plane of this schmidt reflector .",
    "we spent 2001 designing , testing , and verifying the search pipeline with the large data stream from this telescope .",
    "full search operations began in the fall of 2002 and continued through april of 2003 when the neat12gen2 camera was replaced by the yale quest group  @xcite with a 112-chip , 9  field - of - view camera ( questii ) capable of both drift - scan and point - and - track observations .",
    "questii became operational in august 2003 and is now providing data for the snfactory search .",
    "the neat group also uses the haleakala 1.2-m msss telescope , but as this telescope has a smaller field of view and poor image quality , the snfactory has focused its search efforts on the images from the palomar oschin telescope .",
    "the snfactory , in collaboration with the high performance wireless research and education network  @xcite , has established a high - speed , 6  megabyte - per - second ( mbps ) radio internet link to the san diego supercomputer center ( sdsc ) from the palomar observatory .",
    "images are transmitted from the telescope and stored at the national energy research supercomputing center ( nersc ) high performance storage system ( hpss ) .",
    "the bandwidth from sdsc to nersc allows for near real - time transfer of 2050  gb per night . from hpss",
    "the data are transferred to the 200-node nersc parallel distributed systems facility ( pdsf ) and are submitted for simultaneous processing on the pdsf cluster in groups based on the dark frame taken closest in time .",
    "the processed images are then registered with our image database , renamed to match our canonical name format , and saved to hpss .",
    "the snfactory searches these data for sne using image subtraction .",
    "the computers use a sophisticated suite of image tools , but there remains a significant , although ever - decreasing , amount of human interpretation needed to discriminate the good sn candidates from the bad . the same software used by the snfactory to search for nearby ( z @xmath3 ) sne is used by the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) to search for distant sne .",
    "our subtraction software begins by spatially registering all of the images of a given field to a common reference system .",
    "the images to be used as a reference are stacked into a single coadded image , while the images to be searched are coadded into two separate images to allow for later checks for asteroids and cosmic rays . to account for differences in the effective point - spread - function from variations in atmospheric and telescope conditions ,",
    "we calculate a convolution kernel to match each coadded image to the worst - seeing coadded image of the set .",
    "an automated scanning program looks for objects in the convolution - matched , subtracted image and applies a variety of selection criteria to eliminate cosmic rays , asteroids , and subtraction and detector artifacts .",
    "this program compiles a list of interesting candidates to be looked at in more detail by a human scanner . every day",
    ", human scanners consult the list of interesting candidates and decide whether or not a computer - flagged candidate appears to be a real , variable object .",
    "once we have a promising candidate , we submit it to the target list for the next night of observation with neat . after obtaining confirmation images of a candidate that reveal it to exhibit the appropriate behavior for a sn",
    ", we announce the apparent sn in the iau circulars .",
    "a confirmation spectrum is desirable but currently not always possible .",
    "when the snifs instrument is installed on the hawaii 2.2-m telescope , it will be automatically scheduled to confirm and follow sne .",
    "spectra will be taken of each sn at 35  day intervals over a span of roughly 60  days .",
    "eighty - three sne have been found using the techniques described above and have been accepted by the international astronomical union .",
    "[ fig : sne_mosaic ] shows the 35 sne we discovered in 2002 . in the first five months of 2003",
    ", we found and reported an additional 48 sne .",
    "in addition , our search identified another 17 sne that had already been reported by other groups .",
    "we are currently running with a very conservative set of selection criteria and need human eyes to scan @xmath4% of the successful subtractions for each night .",
    "however , many of the sne discovered in 2003 could have been found using very restrictive criteria that would have required human scanning for @xmath5% of the subtractions . to further reduce our scanning burden , efforts are ongoing to understand the parameter space of our candidate scores to uniquely identify the sne . in order to understand our search results ,",
    "we have developed a simple search simulator .",
    "we use a v - band lightcurve template from @xcite to model the rise and fall of sne  ia .",
    "the simulator calculates the amount of time a supernova would be visible at a given redshift assuming a normal ( stretch  @xmath6 ) sn  ia .",
    "we considered a redshift range from @xmath7 , a limiting unfiltered magnitude of 19.5 , and several different repeat coverage cadences for our simulations .",
    "we included the typical neat sky coverage rate , @xmath8/night , and assumed @xmath910,000@xmath10 of usable sky a night .",
    "there is a maximum effective cadence , @xmath11 , beyond which one is just idling the telescope : @xmath12 . for the neat observation program",
    ", this cadence is approximately 20 days .",
    "an important goal of the snfactory is to discover sne early enough after explosion to follow them through their rise and fall .",
    "[ fig : compare_phase ] shows a comparison of our simulations of the sne discovery phase with the actual discovery phase for sne from the snfactory search having well - known dates of maximum . for shorter sky coverage cadences",
    "less sky can be covered and so fewer sne are discovered overall , although the epoch of each sn can be better constrained .",
    "[ fig : compare_phase ] clearly shows that the snfactory search pipeline is successfully finding sne  ia early in their lightcurves .",
    "the nearby supernova factory search pipeline is operational and has proven the ability to discover @xmath13  sne / month @xmath14 @xmath0150  sne / year . as @xmath15 of the supernovae discovered in our search have been sne  ia , we expect to discover @xmath16  sne  ia / year .",
    "most of these supernovae have been discovered sufficiently early to enable detailed study starting before maximum light .",
    "this extensive study will enable improvements in the use of sne  ia for cosmological measurements , and provide a wealth of information on the supernovae themselves ."
