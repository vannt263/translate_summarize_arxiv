    "perfect fluid spheres , either newtonian or relativistic , are the first approximations in developing realistic stellar models  @xcite . because of the importance of these models , fully general `` algorithmic '' solutions of the perfect fluid constraint in general relativity have been developed over the last several years  @xcite . for some of the key highlights of earlier history regarding perfect fluid spheres see references  @xcite , while for a recent analysis providing upper and lower bounds on the internal structure of a relativistic perfect fluid sphere one might consult  @xcite .    for our current purposes ,",
    "the central idea is to start solely with spherical symmetry , which implies that in orthonormal components the stress energy tensor takes the form : @xmath0,\\ ] ] and then use the perfect fluid constraint @xmath1 .",
    "this simply makes the radial pressure equal to the transverse pressure . by using the einstein equations , plus spherical symmetry",
    ", the equality @xmath1 for the pressures becomes the statement @xmath2 in terms of the metric components , this leads to an ordinary differential equation [ ode ] , which then constrains the spacetime geometry , for _ any _ perfect fluid sphere .",
    "the big recent change has been the discovery and development of  algorithmic \" techniques that permit one to generate large classes of perfect fluid spheres in a purely mechanical way  @xcite . in this article",
    "we will summarize and discuss our recent work on these algorithmic ideas  @xcite , providing several solution - generating theorems of varying levels of complexity .",
    "we shall then explore the formal properties of these solution - generating theorems , and shall then use these theorems to classify some of the previously known exact solutions .",
    "moreover , we shall then generate several new previously unknown perfect fluid solutions , and finally we shall show how one can rephrase all these theorems directly in terms of the pressure profile and density proflie .",
    "start with some static spherically symmetric geometry in schwarzschild ( curvature ) coordinates @xmath3 and assume it represents a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "that is , @xmath4 . while @xmath5 is always fulfilled due to spherical symmetry , setting @xmath6 supplies us with an ode @xmath7b'+[2r^2\\zeta''-2(r\\zeta)']b + 2\\zeta=0 \\ , , \\ ] ] which reduces the freedom to choose the two functions in equation ( [ line_element_1 ] ) to one .",
    "this equation is a first order - linear non - homogeneous equation in @xmath8 .",
    "thus  once you have chosen a @xmath9  this equation can always be solved for @xmath8 .",
    "solving for @xmath8 in terms of @xmath9 is the basis of the analyses in references  @xcite , ( and is the basis for theorem 1 below ) . on the other hand , we can also re - group this same equation as @xmath10 which is a linear homogeneous 2nd order ode for @xmath9 , which will become the basis for theorem 2 below .",
    "the question we are going to answer in this section is , how to systematically `` deform '' this geometry while still retaining the perfect fluid property . that is ,",
    "suppose we start with the specific geometry defined by @xmath11 and assume it represents a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "we will show how to `` deform '' this solution by applying four different transformation theorems on @xmath12 , such that the outcome still presents a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "the outcome of this process will depend on one or more free parameters , and so automatically generates an entire family of perfect fluid spheres of which the original starting point is only one member .",
    "we also try to find the connection between all different transformation theorems      the first theorem we present is a variant of a result first explicitly published in reference @xcite .",

    "now , instead of starting with theorem 1 we could first apply theorem 2 on @xmath46 .",

    "below we present two tables which describe the inter - relationships of certain examples of perfect fluid spheres under @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we define a seed metric as one for which theorem 1 and theorem 2 both yield output metrics distinct from the input metric : @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast for non - seed metrics one or the other of these theorems is trivial , either @xmath71 or @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the metric or a parameterized class of metrics ) .",
    "classifying perfect fluid spheres into seed and non - seed metrics is a very useful step .",
    "our theorems are effectively a device to generate new solutions for a perfect fluid sphere without _ explicitly _ solving the einstein equations .",
    "( of course our theorems are set up in such a way that one is _ implicitly _ solving the einstein equations . )",
    "the terminology used in the tables is more fully explained in reference  @xcite .",

    ". the notation `` [ integral ] '' denotes a metric so complicated that explicitly writing out the relevant integral is so tedious that it does not seem worthwhile .",
    "the terminology is more fully explained , and the relevant metrics explicitly presented , in reference  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the tolman  oppenheimer  volkov [ tov ] equation constrains the internal structure of general relativistic static perfect fluid spheres @xcite .",
    "we have developed several `` solution generating '' theorems for the tov , whereby any given solution can be deformed to a new solution . because these theorems work directly in terms of the physical observables  the pressure profile and density profile",
    " it is relatively easy to examine the density and pressure profiles for physical reasonableness .",
    "this section complements our previous theorems wherein a similar `` algorithmic '' analysis of the general relativistic static perfect fluid sphere was presented directly in terms of the spacetime geometry  in the present analysis the pressure and density are primary and the spacetime geometry is secondary . specifically , consider the well - known tov system of equations , whose derivation is now a common textbook exercise  @xcite : @xmath74\\;[m(r)+ 4\\pi p(r)\\ , r^3 ] \\over   r^2 [ 1 - 2m(r)/r ] } ; \\\\ { dm(r)\\over dr } & = & 4\\pi \\,\\rho(r ) \\ , r^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we adopt units where @xmath75 so that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are dimensionless .",
    "our basic strategy will be to assume that somehow we have obtained , or been given , some specific `` physically reasonable '' solution of the tov equation in terms of the profiles @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "viewed as a differential equation for @xmath80 , with @xmath81 [ and hence @xmath82 specified , the tov equation is a specific example of a ricatti equation , for which the number of useful solution techniques is unfortunately rather limited . using standard results ( see the explicit discussion in reference  @xcite , or for example the general references  @xcite )",
    "it is relatively simple to present the following :    [ [ theorem - p1 ] ] theorem * p1 * + + + + + + + + + + + +    let @xmath78 and @xmath79 solve the tov equation and hold @xmath83 fixed .",

    "using schwarzschild coordinates we have developed two fundamental transformation theorems that map perfect fluid spheres into perfect fluid spheres .",
    "moreover , we established two additional transformation theorems by composing the first and second generating theorems .",
    "we then used these transformations as a basis for classifying different types of perfect fluid sphere solutions .",
    "if we apply these theorems on a known perfect fluid sphere , different solutions are often obtained . while some of the solutions are already known in the literature , most of them are novel .",
    "therefore , we have developed a tool to generate new solutions for a perfect fluid sphere , but which does not require us to directly solve the einstein equations . in principle _ all _ solutions of the perfect fluid constraint should be obtainable in this manner . in short , perfect fluid spheres may `` simple '' , but they still provide a surprisingly rich mathematical and physical structure .",
    "furthermore , we have also developed two `` physically clean '' solution - generating theorems for the tov equation  where by `` physically clean '' we mean that it is relatively easy to understand what happens to the pressure and density profiles , especially in the vicinity of the stellar core .    finally , we reiterate that the relativistic perfect fluid sphere , despite its venerable history , continues to provide interesting surprises .",
