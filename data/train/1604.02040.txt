    "chains and arrays of magnetic atoms on a superconducting surface offer a promising route to topological superconductivity @xcite and accompanying majorana quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "different aspects of these systems are under intense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation at the moment . while the application potential of magnetic chains seem more rigid compared to the semiconducting nanowire - based realizations @xcite of topological superconductivity , they also offer important advantages over them .",
    "perhaps the most prominent advantage is the fact the magnetic chains can be accurately mapped by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) techniques .",
    "the semiconductor nanowire systems with proximity superconductivity are naturally discussed in the language of normal state nanowire properties , such as a fermi velocity , transverse modes and a mean free path of the wire .",
    "these concepts do not have straightforward counterparts in magnetic chains , especially in the dilute shiba limit .",
    "also , magnetic chains have their own characteristic properties such as long - range hopping between the sites @xcite . since the early work on the subject @xcite , the effects of disorder in the nanowire systems @xcite and kitaev s toy model @xcite have been studied extensively .",
    "however , the special properties of magnetic chains have received relatively little attention @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the topological and spectral properties of disordered magnetic chains .",
    "also , since stm techniques enable a single - atom resolved manipulation of the structures , a controlled introduction of defects could be employed to identify the topological phase .    despite the long history of the subject of magnetic impurities on @xmath0-wave superconductors ,",
    "a comprehensive picture has emerged only in the past two decades .",
    "bulk superconductors with arbitrary magnetic impurity concentrations are gapless @xcite  in addition to the extended impurity band of hybridized subgap yu - shiba - rusinov states @xcite there exists rare configurations of lumped impurities .",
    "the rare - region fluctuations induce lifshitz tails to the density of states ( dos ) , that persist to all subgap energies @xcite .        in this work",
    "we study vacancies induced by missing magnetic atoms in a regular magnetic chain .",
    "this starting point is complementary to the shiba problem where inhomogeneity is a magnetic impurity atom .",
    "a periodic magnetic atom chain on a superconductor is not disordered  the subgap bands are characterized by gapped one - dimensional ( 1d ) energy bands . the subgap band may undergo a topological phase transition so that the magnetic lattice forms a topological superconductor . when the magnetic lattice breaks periodicity due to some source of disorder , the system generally acquires low - energy disorder states @xcite that will eventually destroy the topological phase .",
    "in addition to vacancies , we consider disorder originating due to locally fluctuating shiba coupling @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dos of the host superconductor , @xmath3 is the exchange coupling between the atom and the bulk electrons and @xmath4 is the impurity spin .    below we will treat three different models that exhibit topological superconductivity , illustrated in fig .",

    "we introduce a formalism which is valid at arbitrary subgap energies and can be employed when the effective low - energy theory does not allow a formulation in terms of a hamiltonian .",
    "in addition to ferromagnetic shiba chains embedded in a 2d superconductor with a rashba soc , in sec .  [ helical ] we will analyze helical shiba chains embedded in a 3d superconductor .",
    "we begin by studying a system of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - orbit coupled superconducting chain which is decorated by magnetic moments .",
    "this simple model can not reproduce all the nuances of realistic systems but has previously revealed much intuition to the phenomenology in magnetic chains .",

    "this problem has , especially in the topologically nontrivial phase , close analogy to the problem of dilute magnetic impurities in a @xmath0-wave superconductor . in analogy to a subgap shiba state bound to a single magnetic impurity",
    ", a single vacancy state gives rise to a localized low - energy state below the topological gap edge .",
    "this can be interpreted as two hybridized majorana states at the weak link formed by the vacancy .",

    "in fact , the subgap dos in the presence of single and dilute concentration of vacancies depicted in figs .",
    "[ ferrofour ] ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) would be qualitatively difficult to distinguish from the spectrum of an @xmath0-wave superconductor with weak concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "however , at high vacancy concentrations there are qualitative differences between the two models . in strongly disordered topological chains ,",
    "lumped vacancy configurations give rise to domain walls of near zero energy majorana end states .",
    "thus , a topological chain at strong disorder will universally display a griffiths effect manifesting as a singular density of states at the fermi energy @xcite . in our work we focused on finite chains with weak disorder , since we believe these to be closer to experimental interest .",
    "experimentally the vacancy states could serve as a tool to verify the existence of the topological phase .",
    "vacancy sites could be created by stm techniques that are used to probe the chains . whether this is feasible or not depends on the chemistry of the adatoms and the surface properties of the employed materials . in principle , a single atom resolved manipulation is possible under suitable circumstances .",
    "our results indicate that in the shiba limit the single - vacancy subgap states are only present in the topologically nontrivial phase at physically relevant parameters .",
    "creating a vacancy and identifying the resulting subgap state could serve as a smoking gun for the bulk topology . furthermore , creating two vacancy states at different distances apart would reveal the hybrization of the vacancy states . in the dense chain",
    "the situation is not as clear cut as some trivial regions also support low - energy vacancy bound states .",
    "the marked difference between the short - range model of densely - packed moments and the long - range shiba models is that the latter exhibit fragile regions in the phase space where the single - vacancy bound state energy is tuned very close to the gap center . in these part of the topological phase diagram the gapped state is washed away by a low vacancy concentration .",
    "this effect is not correlated with the gap size and results in nucleation of gapless phase in the middle of the topological phase , splitting it to disconnected regions . in all models",
    "the deterioration of the topological phase at low vacancy concentration is driven by proliferation of the vacancy band , starting from the single vacancy energy and spreading to both directions until the gap of the clean system has been filled by a significant density of states .",
    "finally , we also studied local fluctuations of the shiba coupling that cause random shifts in the shiba bound state energies .",
    "we studied how this type of disorder affects the topological band formation in the chains of magnetic atoms .",

    "this gives us the phase boundaries in a compact form @xmath171 for a planar helix , this gives the complete phase diagram for the @xmath24 invariant , but as soon as we move away from @xmath111 , gapless regions emerge .",
    "these can not be accounted for using this procedure since the gapless regions have gap closings away from @xmath172 .",
    "however , the above relation provides a complete @xmath81 description of a planar helix .",
    "where @xmath45 is the unperturbed green s function of the underlying superconductor and @xmath174 .",
    "this can be further written as @xmath175 by restricting the position vector to the positions of magnetic atoms and introducing notation @xmath176 we obtain a closed eigenvalue problem @xmath177 . regarding @xmath178 and @xmath179 as matrices in the site indices , we can write the eigenvalue problem in more abstract matrix notation as @xmath180 or equivalently as @xmath181 hence we see that the matrix @xmath63 can be viewed as a product of the green s function of the unperturbed superconductor and the inverse green s function of the full system restricted to the magnetic sites .",
    "the spectrum of the chain can be found as poles for the green s function @xmath182 .",
    "since @xmath45 does not have subgap poles or zeros , the subgap spectrum can equivalently be obtained from @xmath183 . since also the subgap kernel of @xmath75 and @xmath184 coincide , the difference between them is largely immaterial .      while the nlevp matrices in eqs .  ,",
    "contain all the information about the subgap energy bands and their topology , the straightforward solution of the spectral problem is rather resource intensive and a more expedient method is hence desirable .",
    "also , typically the topological properties are extracted from a 1d hamiltonian of the system which is not the fundamental object in the low - energy effective theory . in clean systems , it is possible to obtain the winding number from the nlevp matrix in reciprocal space as outlined in ref .",
    "however , in disordered systems momentum is not a good quantum number and alternative methods are required . in cases where only the parity of the topology is relevant , the @xmath24 invariant can be obtained from the pfaffian of the hamiltonian in a suitable basis , avoiding the need for an explicit solution of the eigenvalues and vectors .",
    "therefore it is desirable to find a similar approach .    for a given nlevp @xmath186 we can define a topological hamiltonian @xmath187 with an auxiliary spectral problem as @xmath188",
    "we stress that @xmath185 should _ not _ be employed in finding the spectrum of the system .",
    "however , a closer look reveals that the topological properties of models and can be obtained from one another : in the limit @xmath189 , we have @xmath190 and @xmath191 . in particular , this means that the gap closings of the two systems _ coincide _ , and that their zero energy solutions are _ exactly _ identical .",
    "further , the hamiltonian @xmath185 inherits the symmetries of the original system .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the @xmath24 topological phase diagram of the original system by considering that of the effective system introduced here ; as the pfaffian only changes sign at gap closings , and a negative sign corresponds directly to zero energy modes @xcite , the phase diagrams will also coincide .    to regard @xmath185 as a hamiltonian , it must be hermitian .",
    "this is true in the clean limit and for vacancy disorder , where the nlevp matrices in eqs .   and are hermitian .",
    "however , the case of local @xmath89 disorder requires a slight reformulation of the problem .",
    "going back to eq .   but allowing for @xmath89 to vary locally , we have @xmath192 multiplying both sides by @xmath193 and then going through the steps to obtain the nlevp , we find in the ferromagnetic case @xmath194 where we have introduced the matrix @xmath195 , and the prime on the other submatrices indicate @xmath196 . in the limit @xmath189",
    "this lets us define a hamiltonian @xmath185 as outlined previously in this chapter ; as the resultant hamiltonian is a real matrix in the bdi symmetry class , it can conveniently be antisymmetrized through multiplication with the particle - hole symmetry operator , as was done in the dense chain .",
    "this allows a direct calculation of the pfaffian , yielding the phase diagram of the system . in the helical model",
    "the process is somewhat more involved : while a hermitian @xmath185 can be similarly obtained , it is a complex hamiltonian in the symmetry class d , preventing simple antisymmetrization by use of the phs operator .",
    "however , in the planar limit , @xmath111 , it also in symmetry class bdi . consequently the effective hamiltonian in that model can be made real by a unitary transformation @xmath197 with @xmath198 , and subsequently antisymmetrized to allow calculation of the pfaffian .",
    "as seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath81 phase boundaries of the helical model are independent of the angle @xmath112 , and hence the phase diagram thus obtained is correct for general parameters with the caveat that the boundaries of gapless phase is not captured by the approach ."
