    "the first measurement of radiative muon capture ( rmc ) on hydrogen , ^-+p_+ n + , has been reported by a triumf group @xcite , and the value of the induced pseudoscalar constant @xmath0 was deduced to be about 1.5 times larger than that predicted by the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) or that obtained from one - loop order heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) calculations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the photon spectrum from rmc on a proton was obtained within the context of hbchpt up to next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) , i.e. , to one loop order .",
    "the results simply confirm a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) hbchpt calculation @xcite and the earlier theoretical predictions @xcite based on a phenomenological tree - level feynman graph approach .",
    "furthermore , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that the chiral series converges rapidly , and thus suggest that the discrepancy between experiment and theory observed for rmc on a proton can not be explained by higher order corrections within hbchpt .",
    "since then , many analyses have been reported , incorporating a variety of new elements and suggestions , but all have essentially confirmed earlier results and concluded that the existing discrepancy is still unexplained @xcite .    as it appears that a nnlo calculation which includes all diagrams through one - loop order converges sufficiently , the only possibilities for significant improvement would seem to come from effects outside the context of hbchpt , or perhaps from terms originating in the wess - zumino lagrangian .",
    "these wess - zumino terms turn out to be negligible however , as shown in ref .",
    "furthermore , all possible expressions in the amplitude which can be composed of the characteristic operators involved in the reaction , namely the polarization vectors of the photon and the lepton current , the three - momenta of the outgoing photon and of the exchanged weak vector boson , and the spin operator of the nucleon , emerge already in the one - loop order .",
    "therefore , higher order contributions in the hbchpt perturbation series will give corrections only to the coefficients of these operator expressions and should be small , in view of the rapid convergence of the chiral series in this reaction .",
    "this led us to the conclusion that something other than the ingredients of the hadronic vertices may in fact be the source of the problem .",
    "for example , there may be difficulties in our understanding of the atomic and molecular states of the muonic atom in hydrogen .",
    "in particular the dependence of the photon spectrum on the initial muonic atom states is non - negligible , so that it is important to try to find a quantity which is less sensitive to the atomic and molecular states but , at the same time , is sensitive to the pseudoscalar constant .    quite recently ,",
    "some alternative scenarios for possible resolution of the `` @xmath0 puzzle '' have been suggested by two groups . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the photon spectrum corresponding to the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite was fitted by adjusting a parameter @xmath1 , with @xmath2 giving the fraction of spin @xmath3 ortho @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath4 molecular state in liquid hydrogen .",
    "a value @xmath6 was obtained , which is smaller than the theoretical prediction @xmath7 @xcite and would correspond to a 10 to 20 % component of the spin 3/2 state .",
    "found for rmc .",
    "that result was obtained however using a formula relating the liquid hydrogen and ortho molecular rates which did not correspond to the experimental conditions of the omc experiment @xcite . using an appropriate formula @xcite",
    "one finds that @xmath7 results in a value which is in good agreement with the omc data .",
    "however if one considers the uncertainties in the data and in some of the parameters one finds that values of @xmath1 as small as @xmath8 are possible , which is consistent , but only marginally so , with the result found for rmc . ] in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , the authors speculate that the `` @xmath0 puzzle '' can be explained by accumulation of small effects and variations of parameters , or perhaps by an isospin breaking effect .    as we have observed , the present situation viewed from the context of hbchpt can be summarized as follows .",
    "all symmetries of qcd are respected order by order in this theory and the chiral expansion is rapidly converging .",
    "the rapid convergence is fortunate , since to improve the theory by calculating higher orders would require including all of the many possible diagrams of the chiral order under consideration and would normally introduce a large number of new low energy constants which would have to be constrained by experiments .",
    "furthermore , the hbchpt results agree fairly well with those obtained from the standard diagram approach , so that all theoretical approaches are reasonably consistent , and unable to explain the rmc data with the predicted value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is probably important to remeasure the photon spectrum in rmc , or to measure more precisely the rate for ordinary muon capture ( omc ) , @xmath9 , as has been proposed @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could consider performing a rather more sophisticated experiment which would be sensitive to some different combination of the ingredients of the problem .",
    "in that vein , we want to propose here to measure the polarization of the outgoing photon .",
    "measuring the photon polarization enables us to choose the most important graphs which involve pion poles and therefore to enhance the dependence of the result on the pseudoscalar coupling constant @xmath0 . in the usual transverse gauge by far",
    "the most important diagram for rmc is the one where the photon is emitted from the leptonic current .",
    "the pseudoscalar coupling constant is an important contributor to this diagram , since @xmath0 is so much larger than @xmath10 or @xmath11 , but its importance is not enhanced by the pion pole because the momentum transfer in this diagram is always spacelike .",
    "therefore , to concentrate on the pseudoscalar constant , we would like to find the channel where this diagram is blocked .",
    "the polarization experiment blocks this channel .",
    "the rationale is simple and transparent . since the neutrino is left - handed , the photon emitted from the leptonic current is right - handed .",
    "this was shown for v and a couplings in ref .",
    "@xcite and generalized to include the induced couplings as well in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of a left - handed photon filters out the photon from the leptonic current , and is thus sensitive to radiation from the hadronic current .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 comes from the fact that some parts of the hadronic current , and in particular some parts containing pion poles , are of leading order by the power counting rules of hbchpt .",
    "the photon circular polarization in rmc ( to be defined explicitly below ) has been considered before in the context of a phenomenological treatment of the weak nucleon current parameterized by form factors @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the circular polarization ( and also the photon asymmetry relative to the muon spin ) could be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nucleon mass and where the coefficient of the @xmath14 term involves the various coupling constants .",
    "we will discuss below the expansion scheme in powers of @xmath15 corresponding to this theorem and its connection to the power counting scheme of hbchpt .",
    "the feynman graphs contributing to rmc on a proton can be classified into the two classes shown in fig . 1 : ( a ) the first corresponds to those graphs where the muon radiates , and ( b ) the second to the graphs where the hadron radiates .",
    "the amplitude of the process can then be written as the sum of two diagrams , m_fi = ^ * _ , [ eq;amplitude ] where @xmath16 is the electric charge , @xmath17 is the fermi constant , @xmath18 is a kobayashi - maskawa matrix element , and @xmath19 is the polarization vector of photon .",
    "the hadron matrix elements with three and four legs are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "their properties have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are briefly discussed in the next section .",
    "the lepton matrix elements with three and four legs , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by _ & = & |u__(1-_5)u _ , [ eq;jl ] + m _ & = & |u__(1-_5 ) _ u _ , [ eq;ml ] where @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) is four momentum of muon ( photon ) , @xmath25 is the muon mass , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the dirac spinor for the muon ( neutrino ) .",
    "first , we study the lepton matrix elements involving a polarized photon . in the laboratory frame",
    "we assume that the @xmath28-axis of our coordinate system coincides with the neutrino direction and the @xmath29-@xmath28 plane includes the photon trajectory .",

    "three of the seven lec s appear in the three point vertex functions of @xmath20 , and they are fixed by the vector and axial vector radius and the goldberger - treiman discrepancy @xcite .",
    "one of the remaining four constants is fixed via a rare pion decay @xcite , and the remaining three constants are estimated using the @xmath67(1232 ) and @xmath68 saturation method @xcite .",

    "the connection to the hbchpt approach can be made via the goldberger - treiman relation which tells us that the pseudoscalar form factor has the structure due to pion propagation , i.e. a pion pole , and is given explicitly by @xmath81 .",
    "in hbchpt this expression , rather than @xmath0 , will appear in all the pion pole terms and the @xmath13 in the numerator will cancel the @xmath13 appearing in the denominator , thus pushing this term to one lower order in the expansion than it is in the expansion of the phenomenological relativistic model@xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss what is known regarding the polarization observables of the muon capture .",
    "as mentioned before , a general theorem tells us that @xmath82 is formally @xmath83@xcite .",
    "using a phenomenological treatment of the weak nucleon current parameterized by the form factors one can show that hadron matrix elements are of order @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the @xmath78 expansion @xcite .",

    "however , @xmath82 is not particularly small , as also noted in @xcite , because it contains a term proportional to @xmath87 , and @xmath0 is large , as is explained in the previous paragraph .",
    "so to summarize , one can understand the connection between the theorem derived by expansion of the relativistic phenomenological model in ref .",
    "@xcite and the corresponding hbchpt expansion by noting that there is a one to one correspondence between the @xmath88 , @xmath78 , and @xmath15 terms in the expansion of the model and the lo , nlo , and nnlo terms of hbchpt , except for the pion pole terms which appear at one lower order in hbchpt because the @xmath13 in the numerator of @xmath0 has been explicitly extracted .",
    "in figs . [ fig;right - pol ] , [ fig;circ - pol ] , [ fig;spectrum - left ] and [ fig;spectrum - right ] we plot various of our results for the spectrum and circular polarization of photons , all calculated in hbchpt up to nnlo .",
    "there are two major issues to discuss .",
    "first , what is the sensitivity to @xmath0 of the spectrum of left - handed photons and the circular polarization and , second , how sensitive are these results to uncertainties in our knowledge of the muon atomic states .",
    "let us first study the sensitivity of the polarization observables to the value of @xmath0 . in figs [ fig;right - pol ] and [ fig;circ - pol ]",
    "we plot the spectrum of left - handed photons and the photon circular polarization , respectively , in the `` experimental state '' ( 6.1 % atomic hyperfine singlet state , 85.4 % ortho @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath4 state , and 8.5 % para @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath4 state ) reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the photon energy @xmath89 60 mev to 100 mev .",
    "we plot three lines which are obtained by using the hbchpt up to nnlo and the relativistic phenomenological model @xcite with two @xmath0 values , @xmath90 and 1.5 , where @xmath91 is the goldberger - treiman prediction for @xmath0 at the momentum transfer corresponding to omc in hydrogen .",
    "one finds that the results are quite sensitive to the value of @xmath0 as expected .",
    "the results of hbchpt and the model with @xmath0=@xmath92 are in good agreement in the both figures which confirms that the same basic ingredients are in both models and that the other higher order corrections in hbchpt and terms not included in the relativistic model are in fact small .",
    "the case of @xmath93 gives a photon spectrum larger by about a factor of three than the case of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore our result shows the strong sensitivity of the polarized photon spectrum to the different values of the pseudoscalar coupling over the experimentally accessible photon energy region .",
    "this is in contrast to the unpolarized photon spectrum where the difference of photon spectra with the two different values of @xmath0 is only of the order of 30 - 40% in the measurable region .",
    "the circular polarization is also sensitive and differs for the two values of @xmath0 by a more or less constant amount 0.2 over the whole relevant region of photon energy .",
    "consider now the question of the sensitivity of the results to aspects of the muon s atomic or molecular state .",
    "the photon spectrum can always be represented by a linear combination of the spectrum of singlet and that of triplet state capture .",
    "the coefficient of each state is determined by the particular target , liquid or gas , by the amount of delay between the muon stop and the beginning of counting , and by the formulas incorporating the various atomic and molecular transition rates which describe the transitions from capture , through singlet , ortho @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath4 and para @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath4 molecular states .",
    "it is known that there are some ambiguities in the parameters of these formulas , particularly with regard to the ortho - para transition rate @xcite and to the possible inclusion of a spin @xmath3 component in the ortho molecule @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ fig;spectrum - left ] and [ fig;spectrum - right ] we plot our results for the spectra of left- and right - handed photons , respectively , for each spin state . the solid , long - dashed , short - dashed , and dotted lines correspond to singlet , triplet , statistical , and ortho states , respectively .",
    "> from these figures one can see immediately some general features .",
    "the spectrum of right - handed photons , which is also essentially the spectrum of unpolarized photons , is much larger than that for left - handed photons . specifically by comparing the two figures we find that the rate for right - handed photons is about 2.5 times larger than that for left - handed photons for the singlet state and 17.3 times larger for the triplet state , when the spectra are integrated over the photon energy @xmath94 60 to 99 mev . under the experimental conditions of the triumf experiment @xcite",
    ", the ortho molecular state is dominant , so that in these conditions one would have about one - tenth as many left - handed photons as right - handed ones .",
    "presumably this enhancement of right - handed photons is due to the strong enhancement of the triplet state and to the fact that the muon radiating diagram dominates , and , as was noted above produces purely right - handed photons .",
    "more specifically , with regard to the question of sensitivity to the atomic and molecular states , we note that if the spectra of singlet and triplet states were the same , the relative amounts would not matter and there would be no sensitivity . from the figures we see that , while this is not the case , the singlet is in fact much more important , and closer to the triplet , for the left - handed photon case than for the right - handed one .",
    "numerically the ratio of the singlet to triplet state spectra , when integrated over the photon energy , is 0.34 for left - handed photons and 0.05 for right - handed photons .",
    "this means that the left - handed photon case will depend less strongly on the relative amounts of singlet and triplet than the right - handed case .",
    "but one should also take into account the result above that the left - handed spectrum is much more sensitive to @xmath0 than the right - handed ( or unpolarized ) spectrum .",
    "thus one concludes that a measurement of the spectrum of left - handed photons , or equivalently the circular polarization of the photons , as we propose here , should be significantly less sensitive to the atomic and molecular ambiguities per unit of sensitivity to @xmath0 than is the right - handed or unpolarized spectrum .",
    "we have discussed rmc on the proton in the case when the measured photon is polarized and have shown that the spectrum involving left - handed photons and the photon circular polarization are quite sensitive to the pseudoscalar coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "they are somewhat less sensitive than the unpolarized case to the atomic and molecular spin state as well .",
    "this is because the dominant diagram with radiation from the muon vanishes when only left - handed photons are considered and because the chiral counting rules of hbchpt select only the pion poles in the leading order contribution from the other diagrams .",
    "thus these observables include the various ingredients of the problem in a somewhat different way than does the unpolarized spectrum and so their measurement may help resolve the current disagreement between theory and experiment based just on the unpolarized spectrum .",
    "the measurement of polarized photons in rmc on the proton is technically extremely challenging .",
    "the spectrum of left - handed photons is only one order of magnitude smaller than that of the unpolarized photons .",
    "however to measure the polarization of the photon one needs an additional scattering through an electromagnetic interaction or alternatively needs to measure the angular distributions of the electron - positron pair produced when the photon is stopped . hence to obtain the same order of precision as that of an unpolarized rmc experiment , the polarization experiment must accumulate more events , say by as much as four orders of magnitude , than the unpolarized experiment .",
    "such measurement is probably impossible with current muon beams and techniques , but may become feasible with the very intense muon beams which are now being discussed .",
    "one should also note that there is an alternative quantity which could be measured , namely the angular asymmetry of the photon relative to the muon spin . by virtue of the general theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite this quantity has generally the same features and sensitivities as does @xmath43 .",
    "it is much easier to measure , since one does not need to rescatter the photon , and in fact has been measured in nuclei @xcite .",
    "however in the case of the proton , the muon loses almost all of its initial polarization as it is captured into atomic orbit .",
    "hence the suppression factor , due now to the low residual polarization of the muon , may be just as large as for the polarized photon observables we have considered here .    on the other hand , in nuclei the capture rate for rmc increases proportional to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the number of protons in the nucleus .",
    "this makes measurements of the unpolarized rate in nuclei relatively easy @xcite .",
    "so it may be feasible to measure the polarized photon observables in rmc on heavy nuclei .",
    "indeed , the pion pole still gives the leading contribution and the general features remain the same , although there are the not insignificant complications in both calculations and interpretation introduced by the nuclear structure .",
