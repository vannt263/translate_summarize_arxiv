    "it is similar to the fermi bridge but has an additional drift which depends on the jacobian determinant of the exponential map .",
    "this additional drift results in the appearance of a potential function which is difficult to understand geometrically .",
    "the random measure @xmath25 can , on the other hand , be written explicitly in terms of jacobi fields .",

    "potential applications of these results are discussed in subsection [ ss : furtherapps ] .",
    "although for this introduction we have assumed that @xmath0 is compact , this is not always necessary .",
    "in fact , we will usually only require some control on the laplacian of the distance function .",
    "geometric conditions for this were given in @xcite .",

    "our estimates can be easily compared to that of cheng , li and yau , stated above for the case in which the injectivity radius of @xmath0 is positive .",
    "[ cor : hesscor ] in addition to the assumptions of theorem [ th : derivativeestiamte ] suppose also that the first covariant derivative of the curvature tensor is bounded .",

    "note that the constant @xmath426 appearing in this estimate depends only on the injectivity radius of @xmath0 , the length of the time interval @xmath15 , the dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath158 and the bounds on the curvature tensor and its derivative .",
    "the results in this article , in particular the estimate on the hessian , will lead to a study of the space of continuous paths which end on a submanifold , potentially shedding light on the relationship between the geometry of the path space , the intrinsic geometry of the ambient manifold and the extrinsic geometry of the submanifold , extending recent work of naber @xcite to the submanifold setting .",
    "a related application , which also concerns the extrinsic geometry of the submanifold , is the study of mean curvature flow ( mcf ) .",
    "mcf typically concerns the codimension one @xmath427 case , where the normal component of the velocity of a point on a hypersurface @xmath2 is given by the mean curvature at that point .",
    "an important object here is the @xmath12-functional @xmath428 introduced by huisken @xcite ( and for which theorem [ th : ihkform ] now provides a probabilistic formula ) .",
    "the monotonicity of this functional under mcf is the reason for its importance .",
    "the _ entropy _",
    "@xmath429 of the hypersurface ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) ) is then defined by @xmath430 .",
    "the entropy captures something of the extrinsic complexity of @xmath2 and determines which singularities can form as a result of the flow ( and by theorem [ th : quadcurvlb ] , the entropy is always greater than or equal to @xmath180 ) .",
    "according to subsection [ ss : hltcomp ] , one can interpret the @xmath12-functional as the ratio @xmath431}{\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbb{e}[l^{\\mathbb{r}^{{m}-1}}_t(x(0))]}.\\ ] ] indeed , the rate at which the expected local time increases for a hypersurface with high mean curvature ought to be greater than that for , say , a minimal hypersurface .",
    "so mcf has an interpretation in terms of hypersurface local time which could lead to further applications of our results .",
    "less abstractly , note that any non - degenerate it diffusion in @xmath46 , constrained to arrive in a submanifold at a fixed positive time , such as on a level set of a function or on the boundary of a domain , is a process of the type considered in this article ( any non - degenerate diffusion on a smooth manifold induces a riemannian metric , via the principle symbol of its generator , with respect to which it is a brownian motion with drift ) .",
    "multi - dimensional it diffusions constrained by the value of an observable at a fixed future time could have applications in finance .",
    "alternatively , consider the case of a particle diffusing inside a biological cell and which is known to exit the cell , via the membrane , at a particular time .",
    "then the possible trajectories of the particle are distributed as those of the corresponding conditioned diffusion ( and the metric could even be used to capture some of the internal structure of the cell ) .    finally , a connection to statistics is given by the problem of manifold denoising ( see @xcite ) , in which data is drawn from sampling a probability distribution supported around a submanifold of euclidean space . the idea is then to reconstruct the submanifold ( or derive certain topological properties of it , as in @xcite ) .",
