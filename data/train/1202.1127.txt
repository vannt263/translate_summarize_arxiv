    "a full understanding of the complex dynamical scenarios accompanying the glass transition requires a resolution of the statistics of free energy barriers at any given temperature .",
    "such information is very hard to come by .",
    "trying to measure such free energy barriers using the energy landscape of a typical glass former is a daunting procedure that has never been achieved . in this paper",
    "we propose a method that provides us with a decent approximation of the statistics of the free energy barriers .",
    "we do this by measuring  quenched \" rather than  annealed \" relaxation times .",
    "the usual procedure for extracting a relaxation time from numerical simulations of any glassy system is the  annealed \" procedure .",
    "one takes many realizations of a super - cooled liquid at a given temperature , measures a typical relaxation function for each realization , averages the relaxation functions over the ensemble and finally extracts a relaxation time @xmath1 from this average relaxation function by , say , determining when the average function reaches @xmath2 of its initial value @xcite .",
    "the subscript @xmath3 designates the ` main ' slow relaxation mechanism in glassy dynamics , and is the only one that is typically resolved in numerical simulations .",
    "this procedure is automatically performed in experiments where the macroscopic nature of the relaxing systems provides self - averaging resulting in ` smooth ' relaxation functions that hardly fluctuate from realization to realization . in this paper",
    "we propose that significant simulational insight on glassy relaxation can be gained by adopting a  quenched \" procedure . in this procedure",

    "one observes the usual dramatic slowing down , such that @xmath5 grows rapidly when @xmath9 decreases , first in a pre - arrhenius form ( see inset ) , then in an arrhenius form , linear in @xmath10 , and later in a faster , super - arrhenius form , which is referred to as ` fragile ' behavior in the glass community @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will be interested predominantly in the transitions to and from the arrehenius regime , for which the quenched procedure is particularly illuminating .",
    "the advantage of the quenched over the annealed procedure is that it allows a particularly transparent treatment of the statistics of free energy barriers .",
    "having an ensemble of @xmath4 values for a given ensemble of super - cooled systems , we can define a typical free energy scale by writing for each @xmath4 value an equation @xmath11 where we choose units such that bolzmann s constant equals unity .",

    "the free energy has in principle a contribution from an energy barrier @xmath13 and an entropic contribution stemming from a degeneracy @xmath14 , @xmath15    of course , this definition makes sense when the dynamics involves escaping an energy barrier .",
    "the prefactor @xmath16 is by definition the relaxation time inside the confined state at every temperature @xmath9 , and we assume that it is fixed for all the realizations in the ensemble : @xmath17 the dependence on @xmath18 stems simply from the estimating @xmath19 , the typical particle velocity , from equipartition as @xmath20 and @xmath16 is then a typical length - scale ( a cage magnitude ) over @xmath19 . for our purpose the constant @xmath21",

    "it is well known that the argument remains approximately valid also when the potential is not a pure power law but with an exponent @xmath58 that needs to be found by collapsing the data @xcite . in the second panel of fig .",

    "additionally , in these systems the inter - particle potential possesses only one energy scale , which is nothing but the depth of the inter - particle potential , denoted as @xmath60 .",
    "this energy scale must determine the typical barrier height that needs to be surmounted in the arrhenius regime .",

    "an obvious worry about our method of analysis is that the dispersion @xmath29 depends on the system size , and therefore the temperature @xmath47 at which we observe the transition to fragility may depend on the system size .",

    "the purpose of this section is to establish one of the main claims of this paper , i.e. that with the transition to the super - arrhenius behavior one observes a change from a local to a cooperative relaxation mechanism . at temperatures below @xmath47",
    "one expects a cooperative relaxation process to play an important role ; the proposition of this paper is that this is mainly due to the disappearance of the free volume that was available in the arrhenius regime ( see quantitative model below ) , requiring now a cooperative motion of many particles to ` collect ' enough free volume to allow a relaxation step .",
    "although such a picture is current among some practitioners in the glass community , to the best of our knowledge it had never been shown explicitly .",
    "we use in this section scaling arguments to establish this picture convincingly .    adding the system size dependence to our typical free energy , we write now    @xmath71.\\ ] ]    we expect @xmath72 to be determined by the energy landscape and not to depend strongly on the system size .",
    "energy barriers are mostly sensitive to local arrangements of particles which are not system size dependent . on the other hand",
    "@xmath73 $ ] is the entropic contribution to the free energy barrier .",
    "our data showed that in the arrhenius regime the degeneracy factor @xmath14 was of the order of unity ; here we will show that our data strongly supports a cooperative process in the super - arrhenius regime , mainly due to the system size dependence of the degeneracy factor .",
    "the flip side of having a cooperative mechanism is that there should exist a typical length @xmath74 which measures the degree of cooperativity and is increasing when the temperature decreases .",
    "consider then a system of @xmath75 particles in the super - arrhenius regime , associated with a typical scale @xmath74 , and contained in a cubic box of size @xmath76 at some temperature @xmath9 .",
    "as long as the system is small , i.e. @xmath77 , the whole system needs to cooperate in order to relax .",
    "accordingly we expect the degeneracy factor to grow extensively like @xmath78 . when the system is large enough , i.e. when @xmath79 we expect to find @xmath80 , not changing with the system size .",
    "in other words , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is typical inter particle distance . accordingly",
    "the free energy should assume the form of a scaling function of @xmath83 as @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is a temperature independent proportionality factor .",
    "the scaling function @xmath86 has the following asymptotic dependence @xmath87",
    "-15pt    considering the small system limit , we conclude that there the free energy barrier should exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the system size .",
    "this expectation is supported by the data shown in fig  [ fvsn ] . in the upper panel",
    "we show the system size dependence of the free energy value where the distribution function @xmath88 has a second peak , for different temperatures . with increasing system size",
    "these values tend to saturate to an asymptotic value .",
    "note that the dependence on the system size seems to be decreasing with increasing temperature , indicating the existence of a cooperative length scale .",
    "we can not go to high temperatures in this study because at higher temperature the extraction of the second peak position become difficult as its height goes down drastically , merging with the arrhenius peak .",
    "we focus on data where the position of the second peak can be estimated accurately . to show the logarithmic dependence on the system size we collapsed the data together by rescaling the free energy axis by @xmath89 with @xmath90 and the x axis by @xmath91",
    ". for simplicity we fitted here a guess function for @xmath74 in the form @xmath92 @xcite . in the lower panel of fig  [ fvsn ] one can see the convincing logarithmic dependence of the free energy on the system size for different temperatures .",
    "the data shown above indicates two changes in the relaxation mechanism between the pre - arrhenius and the arrhenius regime and then between the arrhenius and the fragile regime .",
    "we propose that the pre - arrhenius regime is a fluid regime , in which a well - defined cage is only beginning to form around every particle .",
    "it is relatively easy to break this ill - formed cage , and there are many ways to do it . accordingly the free energy needed is made of a low value of @xmath13 and a finite value of @xmath14 such that when @xmath9 is increasing the gaussian peak that we observe marches to the left and becomes broader .    in the arrhenius regime",
    "a well defined cage has formed around each particle , and this cage is a more or less regular cluster of particles aggregating around each center particle .",
    "we expect a roughly constant energy @xmath13 to suffice to break this kind of cage and the width of the distribution of @xmath12 should be relatively narrow as discussed below . towards the end of the arrhenius regime a second and maybe third layer of next - nearest neighbors begins to form around a center particle , and therefore it becomes more and more difficult for the single - particle relaxation to take place . the energy barrier increases but because of the fluidity of the second and third layer also the width of the distribution starts to increase .    eventually a new , cooperative mechanism must be favored for dynamical relaxation .",
    "note that the apparent mean energy of activation @xmath93 _ increases _ when the temperature decreases below the arrhenius regime .",
    "this must mean that the single particle relaxation mechanism that is operative at the arrhenius regime is no longer available at lower temperatures , since if it were available it would have been selected .",
    "in the temperature range where both mechanisms coexists we indeed find the associated @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be similar .",
    "we thus offer a model of the observed phenomenology on the the following basis :    \\(i ) in the arrhenius regime the relaxation process is an elementary event like a @xmath94 process which is characterized by a relatively sharp free energy cost @xmath95 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of available inequivalent @xmath0 processes .",
    "this energy cost @xmath39 is of the order of breaking through a local cage and the process involves only a few particles . due to the amorphous nature of the super - cooled liquid @xmath39 is a stochastic variable but the dispersion around @xmath39 is relatively small .",
    "we denoted the variance in the distribution of @xmath39 as @xmath98 and noted that in this regime @xmath99 .",
    "\\(iii ) the precise reason for the blocking of this elementary relaxation channel when temperature is lowered is not known .",
    "we will propose , however , that this blocking is due to the disappearance of available free volume per particle @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "in other words , denoting by @xmath101 the minimal average volume that every particle occupies , there must be additional free volume @xmath102 for the @xmath94 process to occur .    of course , the average volume per particle , which is the inverse of the density , @xmath103 , is determined by the equation of state which varies from one material to the other .",
    "we will define @xmath104 as the temperature where the free volume disappears , and then @xmath105 . for the purposes of the present model we estimate the average volume per particle from the first order taylor expansion : @xmath106 where the partial derivative is computed at @xmath107 .",
    "accordingly , since @xmath105 , @xmath108    the probability of having a local free volume @xmath109 is estimated from maximum entropy considerations as @xmath110 consequently the probability that @xmath111 , which is the probability that a @xmath0 process could occur , is @xmath112 finally , we write @xmath113 , where @xmath3 is the isobaric coefficient of thermal expansion at @xmath107 , @xmath114 with this we can write @xmath115 } \\ , \\label{probt1}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless constant @xmath116 .",

    "therefore we can estimate @xmath47 where the two processes are equiprobable from @xmath119 } \\approx 1/2 \\ , \\ ] ] and therefore @xmath120 .",
    "\\(iv ) in the fragile regime we propose that eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) retains its form , but now with a temperature dependent @xmath121 and a sizeable degeneracy @xmath122 .",
    "our picture is that of a relaxation process that involves more and more cooperative motions of a larger and larger number of particles .",
    "this obviously results in an increasing energy barrier @xmath121 which is indeed higher than @xmath39 but selected because the @xmath94 process is no longer available or it requires cooperation from the surroundings to be realized .",
    "also an increase in the number of particles involved must increase @xmath123 simply due to the number of ways that these particles can be chosen .",
