    "the star formation rate density , in particular , first rose in the first few gyr and then declined by more than one order of magnitude in the past 10  gyr ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , the galaxies hosting star formation have systematically changed from being dominated by the highest mass systems in the distant past to a more equal mix of galaxy masses @xcite in the most recent 0.5 gyr , where a representative local volume has been sampled . the processes driving this dramatic evolution",
    "will only be understood if there is a more complete documentation of the time evolution of the major baryonic constituents of the cosmos .",
    "an important baryonic constituent to consider in the context of galaxies is the molecular gas mass ; since this is a prerequisite for star formation and as such plays a key role in determining its rate and location . while ideally nature",
    "would have provided a direct tracer of molecular hydrogen mass under all physical conditions , this is unfortunately not the case ; making it necessary to infer molecular gas mass from indirect measures .",
    "an important proxy for molecular hydrogen is the detection of carbon monoxide ( co ) emission lines . despite the fact that the co emission lines are often highly self - opaque , high resolution studies of individual molecular clouds and nearby external galaxies",
    "have permitted at least rough calibration of the total molecular hydrogen mass that is statistically associated with an observed co line luminosity ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the situation is complicated by a significant statistical scatter as well as the likely dependencies of this association on many other factors . a good recent overview of such calibration factors for the co(10 ) transition is given in @xcite .",
    "the relatively high brightness of the co(10 ) transition has permitted its routine detection in emission at z @xmath7 0.1 ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper we address a major gap in our observational knowledge of the molecular gas mass associated with galaxies by targeting a complete southern sample of the eleven most luminous fir detected galaxies at redshifts 0.2 @xmath9 z @xmath9 0.5 for deep integrations with the mopra 22 m telescope . only a handful of detections",
    "have yet been made in this redshift range @xcite .",
    "our study complements a similar program undertaken by @xcite directed at 30 northern and equatorial targets .",
    "together these studies provide some insights into the evolution of the molecular gas mass in ulirgs during this pivotal era in cosmic history .",
    "the current paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief definition of the sample in  [ sec : sample ] , describe the observations and data reduction methods in  [ sec : obs ] and present the results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a more extensive discussion of the results in a cosmological context is deferred to a subsequent publication . in this paper",
    "we adopt a flat cosmological model with @xmath10  =  0.73 and a hubble constant of 71  km  s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "studies of molecular gas in the local universe ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have demonstrated that the largest gaseous reservoirs are apparently associated with the galaxies most luminous in the far infrared ( fir ) .",
    "this correlation provides an opportunity to sample the molecular content at higher look - back times by targeting ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs , defined by log(l@xmath12 ) @xmath13 12 ) in the relevant redshift interval for deep integrations .",
    "estimates of the total molecular gas mass can then be made on the basis of the molecular mass function @xcite , which may evolve , and the space density of the observed target population .",
    "while this approach is no substitute for complete sampling of the molecular mass function at each look - back time , it provides a first indication of possible trends .",
    "our sample was defined by considering all galaxies tabulated within the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) with fir detections at 60 and 100 @xmath14 m and spectroscopic redshifts in the range z = 0.2  0.5 that exceeded a limiting fir luminosity log(l@xmath12 ) @xmath13 12.5 .",

    "calibration of the antenna temperature for atmospheric attenuation was updated at 15 minute intervals by the use of an absorbing paddle at ambient temperature placed over the feed ( employing the method of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the telescope pointing was updated each hour using the cataloged sio maser of smallest angular separation with the target galaxy , yielding a pointing accuracy of 5  10 arcsec , relative to a fwhm beamwidth of about 36 arcsec .",
    "standard target observing sessions lasted one hour and consisted of alternate target and reference spectra , each of one minute duration , using a pair of reference locations offset by 15 arcmin to both the east and west of each target galaxy .",
    "each target spectrum was calibrated with the average of the two adjoining offset reference spectra . only those observing sessions with stable system temperatures below about 350  k were retained for further processing .",

    "spectral smoothing of the final combined spectra provides a decreasing rms fluctuation level that scales approximately with the square root of bandwidth through about 30  km / s .",
    "further spectral smoothing , from 30 to 90  km / s decreases the fluctuation level by only about 50% , rather than the expected 70% , implying that residual systematic bandpass effects begin to dominate .",

    "once the co luminosity has been temperature - corrected , it seems more likely that a single conversion factor to total molecular hydrogen mass , appropriate to the 25  k reference temperature , might apply . from @xcite",

    "[ fig : dvm ] is that all of the intermediate redshift detections in both the current and @xcite studies depart from the low redshift trend in the direction of extremely low dust - to - molecular gas mass ratio .",

    "it seems plausible that the apparent `` gas poor '' sub - population seen at intermediate redshift in figs .",
    "[ fig : lpco ] ,  [ fig : lpcot ] and  [ fig : dvm ] may simply be a manifestation of agn contamination , with the star formation dominated population demonstrating a well - defined trend relative to the low redshift samples , consistent with a dramatic decline in the dust - to - molecular gass mass ratio .",
    "we consider the distribution of ulirg molecular hydrogen mass with look - back time , @xmath71 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvt ] . since ulirgs are identified by their extreme luminosity in the fir band , where self - opacity and foreground extinction effects are minimal ,",

    "both our own study , as well as the others shown in the figure , were drawn from the most luminous soures in the iras all - sky survey .",
    "as such they are not expected to suffer from incompleteness at high luminosity and despite the fact that they are a rare population , they permit a useful assessment of the associated molecular gas mass that is required to feed the ulirg phenomenon . although the lowest detected gas masses at each look - back time simply reflect the sensitivity of the observation and the cutoff @xmath4 of the sample , the upper envelope to mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvt ] is a significant attribute of the population , at least once the sample extends over a representative volume of about 10@xmath72 mpc@xmath73 ; since the most luminous sources are clearly the easiest to detect at any redshift .",
    "this condition should be met for redshifts greater than about 0.03 , or look - back times exceeding 0.4 gyr .",
    "this local volume saturation effect is apparent in the figure for @xmath74 gyr .",
    "the indicative curve drawn in the figure , @xmath75 demonstrates the order of magnitude decline in maximum molecular gas mass of the ulirg population during the past 5 gyr .",
    "such a decline is comparable to , but even more dramatic , than that seen in the star formation rate density @xcite which can be well described by , @xmath76 for a star formation rate density @xmath77 in m@xmath1yr@xmath11mpc@xmath78 for @xmath79 8 gyr .",
    "this contrast suggests significant changes in the molecular gas mass function at even these modest look - back times .",
