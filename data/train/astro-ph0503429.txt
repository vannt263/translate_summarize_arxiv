    "in the hierarchical model of galaxy formation , large galaxies result from the merging of smaller structures .",
    "these building - block dwarf galaxies are too faint and too small to be studied directly at large redshifts .",
    "however , we stand a much better chance of understanding these with local examples .",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 2366 is suitable for carrying out a detailed study with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . a member of the m81 group of galaxies @xcite , it is at a distance of 3.44 mpc , as determined by cepheid variables @xcite . using the brightest stars as distance indicators ,",
    "@xcite also find a distance of 3.4 mpc .",
    "thus , ngc 2366 is close enough for the galaxy to be resolved into stars by _ hst _ and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of its stellar populations can be constructed to determine its star formation history .",
    "ngc 2366 is the prototype of the interesting class of `` cometary '' galaxies described by @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by an elongated body  the tail of the `` comet ''  and a bright starburst region at its southwest end  the head of the `` comet '' .",
    "the complex of bright high - excitation h ii regions in the southwest part of ngc 2366 is called ngc 2363 @xmath7 mrk 71 .",
    "several abundance measurements have been made for ngc 2363 @xcite .",
    "they yield an oxygen abundance 12 + log o / h @xmath2 7.9 , or 1/10 solar .",
    "modeling of the physical conditions in ngc 2363 , based on observations from the literature , has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "using fabry - perot and optical spectroscopic observations , @xcite have discovered an expanding supernova bubble in ngc 2363 . besides ngc 2363 , there are other h ii regions in ngc 2366 .",
    "@xcite have derived the abundances for several of these h ii regions .",
    "they find their oxygen abundances 12 + log o / h to be in the range 8.1  8.3 , slightly higher than that of mrk 71 .",
    "several observations of ngc 2366 have been made in the 21 cm line @xcite .",
    "all these determinations give similar neutral hydrogen gas masses , @xmath8(h i ) = 8.0 @xmath9 10@xmath10 @xmath11 , so that the ratio of integrated h i content to blue luminosity @xmath8(h i)/@xmath12 is 1.36 @xmath11/@xmath13 . a striking feature of the h i intensity map of ngc 2366 is the presence of two parallel ridges about 6  ( 5.8 kpc ) long running along the major axis of the optical body and separated by a zone nearly devoid of h i. @xcite and @xcite",
    "have interpreted those structures to be a h i ring inclined with respect to the line of sight by an angle of @xmath2 60 .",
    "the h i ring is surrounded by diffuse neutral gas emission , forming an extended envelope around the optical body .",
    "@xcite have used _",
    "hst _ and ground - based observations to obtain cmds of ngc 2363 and discuss its star formation history and that of neighboring star clusters .",
    "however , their analysis was mostly restricted to young stellar populations .",
    "of note is the discovery of a rare luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star in ngc 2366 by @xcite , 5  east of ngc 2363 , and presently the brightest optical source in the galaxy .",
    "the lbv star has been erupting since 1994 .",
    "@xcite have monitored the photometric and spectroscopic time variations of the lbv star with the _ hst _ and have constructed a physical model for it .",
    "the general properties and evolutionary status of ngc 2366 have been discussed by @xcite . they have used photometric and spectroscopic ground - based observations to put constraints on the age of the older stellar populations in ngc 2366 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the light of ngc 2366 is dominated by stellar populations with age not exceeding 3 gyr , significantly lower than the typical age of @xmath4 5 gyr derived for the underlying stellar component of other dwarf galaxies .",
    "however their conclusions are based on population synthesis of spectroscopic observations , the _ hst _ observations of @xcite not being deep enough for studying old stellar populations .",
    "to remedy the situation , we have obtained deep _ hst _",
    "wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 images of ngc 2366 .",
    "we use these data to look anew at both young and old stellar populations of the cometary dwarf galaxy and discuss its evolutionary status .",

    "the observations were broken into five subexposures in the @xmath0 filter and into three subexposures in the @xmath1 filter to permit identification and removal of cosmic rays .",

    "the galaxy was positioned so that the brightest h ii region ngc 2363 is located in the pc frame , to take advantage from its twice as good spatial resolution .",
    "the wfpc2 was oriented in order the major axis of the galaxy lies along the diagonals of the pc and wf3 frames .",
    "the scale of the wfpc2 is 0046 per pixel in the pc frame and 0102 per pixel in the wf frames . because the considerable major axis of ngc 2366 ( @xmath14 @xmath2 300 ) is larger than the combined diagonal lengths of the pc and wf3 frames ( @xmath2 160 ) , the northermost parts of the galaxy could not be imaged .",
    "preliminary processing of the raw images including corrections for flat - fielding was done at the space telescope science institute through the standard pipeline .",
    "subsequent reductions were carried out at the main astronomical observatory of the ukrainian academy of sciences and the university of virginia using iraf and stsdas .",
    "cosmic rays were removed and the images in each filter were combined using the crrej routine .",

    "the extended low - surface - brightness body of the galaxy is visible in all wf and pc frames .",
    "several background galaxies can be seen in the field of ngc 2366 , the brightest of them being the spiral galaxy to the north of region ii .",
    "the superior spatial resolution of the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images combined with the proximity of ngc 2366 permits to resolve the galaxy into individual stars and study its stellar populations by means of cmds .",
    "we used the daophot package in iraf for point - spread - function ( psf)-fitting photometry .",
    "the psfs are derived separately for each of the pc and wf fields and in each filter using the brightest isolated stars in each image .",

    "the detectability limit is set to the 3@xmath15 threshold above the local background noise . to convert instrumental magnitudes with an aperture radius of 2 or 1.5 pixels to the magnitudes corresponding to the @xcite calibrating aperture radius of 05 ( respectively 11 and 5 pixels for the pc and wf frames ) , we need to derive aperture corrections . for this",
    ", we compared psf - fitted magnitudes of bright isolated stars with the magnitudes of the same stars measured with the aperture photometry technique within an 05 aperture . for the pc frames we obtained the corrections @xmath16(05 ) ",
    "@xmath17 = 0.63 mag and @xmath18(05 ) ",

    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the distribution of photometric errors as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes as determined by daophot .",
    "it is seen that errors are about 0.2 mag at @xmath0 = 27 mag and @xmath1 = 26 mag for both pc and wf frames .",
    "they increase to about 0.4 mag at @xmath0 = 28 mag and @xmath1 = 27 mag .",
    "the total numbers of recovered stars in both pc and wf frames are respectively 51632 , 33564 and 22121 in the @xmath0 band , the @xmath1 band and in both bands , adopting a matching radius of 1 pixel .",
    "the corresponding numbers of recovered stars in the pc frame only are 9888 , 5918 and 3415 .",
    "that more than a third of the stars are not matched is due to the combination of incompleteness effects and an increasing number of false detections at faint magnitudes .",
    "the transformation of instrumental magnitudes to the johnson - cousins @xmath20 photometric system as defined by @xcite was performed according to the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of point sources were corrected for galactic interstellar extinction adopting @xmath21 = 0.12 mag and @xmath22 = 0.07 mag @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a completeness analysis for each of the frames using the daophot routine addstar .",
    "for each magnitude bin listed in table [ tab1 ] , we have added artificial stars amounting to @xmath2 5% of the total number of real stars detected in each frame .",
    "we then performed a new photometric reduction using the same procedure as the one applied to the original frame , and checked how many added stars were recovered in this magnitude bin .",

    "the completeness limits of the wf2 and wf4 images are comparable to that of the pc image . however , because of the larger crowding , the completeness limits of the wf3 image are worse , being @xmath2 50% in @xmath0 and @xmath2 30% in @xmath1 in the 25  26 mag range .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the @xmath1 vs @xmath23 cmd of ngc 2366 derived from all frames .",

    "the detection of rgb stars allows to derive the distance to ngc 2366 using the observed magnitude @xmath1 of the tip of rgb stars ( trgb ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows the derivative of the distribution .",
    "the location of the trgb is determined by the first large increase in both the rgb luminosity function and its derivative and is marked by a vertical tick mark in fig .",
    "we obtain @xmath1(trgb ) = 23.65 @xmath5 0.10 mag .",
    "the distance modulus is derived from the equation @xmath6 = @xmath1(trgb ) ",
    "@xmath24(trgb ) .",
    "the absolute @xmath1 magnitude is defined as @xmath24(trgb ) = @xmath26(trgb ) ",
    "@xmath27(@xmath1 ) , where @xmath26(trgb ) is the bolometric magnitude of the trgb and @xmath27(@xmath1 ) is the bolometric correction to the @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "the latter quantity is given as a function of the @xmath23 color of the trgb by @xmath27(@xmath1 ) = 0.881  0.243@xmath28 , while the bolometric magnitude depends on metallicity and is given by @xmath26(trgb ) = 0.19[fe / h ] ",
    "3.81 @xcite .",
    "hence for distance determination , knowledge of the stellar metallicity is necessary .",
    "usually [ fe / h ] is derived using the @xmath23 color of rgb stars at the absolute magnitude @xmath24 = 3 . as pointed out by @xcite from analysis of yale theoretical isochrones , this is because @xmath23 is mainly dependent on metallicity and not very much on age . in fig .",

    "[ fig5]b and [ fig5]c will be discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5]a that the clump of red stars in the ngc 2366 cmd is broad with a significant part located to the blue of the lowest metallicity isochrone , that of the globular cluster m15 .",
    "we believe that the relatively large width of the red star distribution is real and that it is not due to uncertainties in the photometry , as these are small ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the broad distribution implies that star formation in ngc 2366 has occurred for a relatively long period .",
    "the clump consists of a mixture of red helium burning stars and rgb stars of different ages .",
    "we set the @xmath23 color of the trgb to be equal to the color of the reddest rgb stars , ( @xmath23)@xmath29 @xmath2 1.5 .",
    "these stars are presumably the oldest ones in ngc 2363 and hence they are the most appropriate for comparison with globular cluster isochrones .",
    "these reddest stars are fitted reasonably well by the isochrone of the globular cluster m2 with [ fe / h ] = 1.58 . for this metallicity ,",
    "@xmath24(trgb ) = 4.02 mag .",
    "the resulting distance modulus of ngc 2366 is then @xmath6 = 27.67 @xmath5 0.10 .",
    "the corresponding distance to the galaxy is @xmath30 = 3.42 @xmath5 0.15 mpc , in excellent agreement with the values @xmath30 = 3.4 mpc derived by @xcite from the brightest stars and @xmath30 = 3.44 mpc by @xcite from cepheid variables .",
    "it is larger than the value of 2.9 mpc obtained by @xcite , also from the brightest stars .",
    "because @xmath31(trgb ) is only slightly dependent on the @xmath23 color , uncertainties in @xmath32(trgb ) have little influence on the derived distance .",
    "the above distance determination is based on the assumption that the reddest rgb stars in ngc 2366 have the age of globular cluster stars , i.e. are @xmath2 10 gyr old . for younger ages of the rgb stars , theoretical isochrones , e.g. those of the padua group @xcite or the geneva group @xcite",
    ", may be more appropriate .",
    "these are most often used for the analysis of resolved stellar populations in local group and relatively nearby galaxies .",
    "however , as discussed by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these theoretical isochrones do have problems : they do not fit those observed for globular clusters .",
    "in particular , @xcite have shown that , except for the isochrones with @xmath33 = 0.001 from @xcite , all 10 gyr padua isochrones do not reproduce the observed ones for globular clusters , being too blue and not extending to bright enough absolute magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , the isochrones that do fit were obtained from stellar evolutionary models calculated with older opacities .",
    "isochrones obtained from models with new opacities for the same metallicity are again too blue @xcite . as for the theoretical 10 gyr isochrones based on the geneva stellar evolutionary models , they are too red compared to those observed for globular clusters . however , despite all these uncertainties , padua models @xcite can provide a good guide to the dependence of @xmath31(trgb ) on the age of the rgb stars , since in this case we are considering relative rather than absolute values .",
    "these models predict that @xmath31(trgb ) is nearly constant for rgb stars with ages @xmath4 3 gyr .",
    "this implies that the distance of 3.42 mpc derived above for ngc 2366 is valid as long as its oldest rgb stars are @xmath2 3 gyr or older , which is likely the case for ngc 2366 ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "several generations of stellar populations are evidently present in the cmd of ngc 2366 ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) , suggesting that star formation in this galaxy has occurred during the past several gyr .",
    "ongoing star formation is evidenced by the presence of the supergiant h ii regions i and ii at the southwestern edge of the galaxy .",
    "past star formation is inferred from the presence of ms stars with ages of only a few myr , of bl and rsg stars with ages ranging from @xmath2 20 myr to @xmath2 100 myr , of agb stars with ages @xmath4 100 myr and of rgb stars with ages @xmath4 1 gyr .",
    "the spatial distribution of these different stellar populations , as delimited in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . to minimize incompleteness effects ( table [ tab1 ] ) and photometric errors ( fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] and in all the following discussions on star counts only sources that are brighter than @xmath1 = 25 mag .",
    "it can be seen that a large number of the ms stars ( fig . [",
    "fig6]a ) are located in the h ii regions i , ii , and iii as well as in those in the northeast part of the elongated main body .",
    "they show a clumpy distribution , reflecting the compactness of the h ii regions .",
    "but there are also some ms stars that are more evenly distributed over the whole body of the galaxy , out to the edges of the wfpc2 frames .",
    "bl and rsg stars are distributed more smoothly than ms stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) , however their surface density is larger in the high - surface - brightness part of the main body . as for the agb and rgb stars ,",
    "they show a smooth distribution over the whole wfpc2 field of view ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]c  [ fig6]d ) .",
    "there is a clear correlation of the spatial extent of a stellar population with its age : the older the stellar population , the smoother and more extended is its spatial distribution .",
    "such population gradients have been known for a long time , starting with the pioneering studies of the milky way by walter baade in the 1950 s .",
    "they have also been observed in other dwarf galaxies resolved by _ hst _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "fig [ fig7]a shows that the ionization of the gas in region i is mostly caused by cluster a. the ionization of the gas in region ii is not as important , suggesting that extremely young massive stars are absent there .",

    "[ fig8]b shows that extinction is not confined to cluster a. it is also present in the extended red region ( white in figure [ fig8]b ) to the south of cluster a. the red color of this region is due partly to two bright rsg stars and a few other fainter stars , but also to dust .",
    "we have performed aperture photometry of both clusters using an aperture with a 6-pixel radius .",

    "agb / rgb is @xmath3 0.14 for vii zw 403 ( this is an upper limit because vii zw 403 is at a larger distance and the rgb star count is less complete ) and 0.17 in ugc 4483 .",
    "the second striking fact is that agb stars in ngc 2366 are brighter on the mean than those in vii zw 403 and in other dwarf galaxies ( see fig .",
    "14 of @xcite where cmds for five bcds and irregular galaxies outside the local group and six local group irregular galaxies are compared ) .",
    "the agb stars in ngc 2366 have a mean absolute @xmath1 magnitude @xmath2 4.9 mag ( fig . [ fig5 ] ) , brighter by @xmath2 0.3 mag than those in vii zw 403 .",
    "however , they are comparable in brightness to those in ugc 4483 @xcite",
    ".    the difference in the absolute brightnesses of agb stars in ngc 2366 and vii zw 403 can be due to a younger age in ngc 2366 . to derive ages ,",
    "theoretical isochrones are needed .",
    "the ones that are available in the literature fail to reproduce the observed properties of agb stars at low metallicities in several respects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "first , while agb stars in the cmds of ngc 2366 , of the bcds vii zw 403 and ugca 290 and of some local group irregular galaxies have roughly a constant @xmath1 absolute magnitude ( see fig . 14 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the models predict a steady increase of absolute @xmath1 magnitude with increasing @xmath23 color , up to the tip of the agb ( tagb ) phase when the brightness of agb stars is maximum .",
    "the padua theoretical isochrones @xcite with @xmath33 @xmath46 0.001 can not reproduce the red colors of the agb stars seen in these galaxies . as for the geneva isochrones @xcite",
    ", they do not include the agb stage . while the padua isochrones can not be used to derive absolute ages , they are probably good enough for obtaining relative ages .",
    "we thus compare the agb populations of ngc 2366 and vii zw 403 , using the padua models with @xmath33 = 0.001 of @xcite , and assuming that agb stars in both galaxies have the same metallicity .",
    "a difference of 0.3 mag in brightness translates into an age of @xmath2 3 gyr for the agb stars in ngc 2366 assuming an age of @xmath2 10 gyr for those in vii zw 403 .",
    "@xcite have derived an age of @xmath2 2 gyr for the agb stars in the bcd ugc 4483 .",
    "the relative contribution of the bolometric luminosities of agb and rgb stars gives information on the star formation history in ngc 2366 @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the so - called fuel - consumption theorem @xcite which uses as the main ingredient of population synthesis the amount of nuclear fuel burned in each evolutionary stage",
    ". then the bolometric luminosity can be calculated at each evolutionary stage .",
    "the models so calculated predict that , in the case of instantaneous star formation , the total bolometric luminosity of agb stars is greater than that of rgb stars if the age of the stellar population is @xmath3 1  2 gyr @xcite . at ages of @xmath2 10 gyr",
    "the relative contribution of agb stars decreases and becomes @xmath2 4 times lower than that of rgb stars . if instead star formation has occurred from now to the past , then the contribution of agb stars is always greater than that of rgb stars @xcite .    converting the observed @xmath1 magnitudes of",
    "all observed agb and rgb stars to bolometric magnitudes and adding their luminosities , we obtain the ratio of the total bolometric luminosity of agb stars to rgb stars to be @xmath2 1.4 .",
    "such a ratio corresponds to an age of @xmath2 1 gyr in the case of instantaneous star formation , but this age is higher if star formation occurs on longer timescales .",
    "it is likely that @xmath2 1  3 gyr ago , star formation activity in this galaxy was higher than now .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that 10 gyr old stars are present in ngc 2366 .",
    "because of the age - metallicity degeneracy of the rgb and too large a distance which prevents the detection of indicators of old stellar populations , such as rr lyrae , red giant clump and horizontal branch stars , we can not put a definite upper limit to the age of ngc 2366 with our present wfpc2 observations .",
    "hst_/acs observations are needed .",
    "all we can say is that the detected stellar populations are consistent with an age not exceeding @xmath2 3 gyr .",
    "however , this upper limit is not very firm because of the uncertain metallicity of agb and rgb stars .",
    "finally , we note that the cmd of ngc 2366 which shows an important rgb stellar population is quite different from the cmd of i zw 18 , the most metal - deficient bcd known , with a metallicity of only @xmath2 1/50 that of the sun .",
    "the cmd of i zw 18 is conspicuous in its lack of rgb stars , making the bcd a bona fide young galaxy with an age @xmath3 500 myr @xcite .",
    "we have obtained _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 @xmath0 and @xmath1 images of the nearby cometary dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 2366 and have studied its resolved stellar population .",
    "the analysis of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of this galaxy has led us to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the cmd of ngc 2366 is populated by stars with different ages including young main - sequence stars with ages @xmath3 30 myr , evolved core helium burning massive stars ( blue - loop stars and red supergiants ) with ages between @xmath2 20 myr and @xmath2 100 myr , and older asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) stars with ages @xmath4 100 myr and @xmath4 1 gyr respectively .",
    "the most notable feature of the cmd is the presence of numerous agb stars . counting only stars brighter than @xmath1 = 25 mag , we find that , while the star count ratios ms / rgb and ( bl+rsg)/rgb which characterize the younger stellar populations , vary in a wide range from region to region , the ratio agb / rgb varies over a relatively narrow range of 0.18  0.36 , with an average value of 0.26 for the whole galaxy . for comparison ,",
    "the ratio agb / rgb is @xmath3 0.14 for the bcd vii zw 403 and 0.17 for the bcd ugc 4483 .",
    "this suggests that , in addition to the present burst of age @xmath3 100 myr , strong star formation activity has occurred during the last @xmath3 3 gyr in ngc 2366 .",
    "the older the stellar population is , the smoother and more extended is its spatial distribution .",
    "this is likely due to diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles .",
    "an underlying population of older stars is found throughout the body of ngc 2366 .",
    "\\3 . from the observed @xmath1 magnitude of the tip of the rgb equal to 23.65 @xmath5 0.10 ,",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry of the resolved stars in the cometary dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 2366 , using wide field planetary camera 2 images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope_. the resulting color - magnitude diagram reaches down to @xmath1 @xmath2 26.0 mag . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals not only a young population of blue main - sequence stars ( age @xmath3 30 myr ) but also an intermediate - age population of blue and red supergiants ( 20 myr @xmath3 age @xmath3 100 myr ) , and an older evolved populations of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( age @xmath4 100 myr ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) stars ( age @xmath4 1 gyr ) . the measured magnitude @xmath1 = 23.65 @xmath5 0.10 mag of the rgb tip results in a distance modulus @xmath6 = 27.67 @xmath5 0.10 , which corresponds to a distance of 3.42 @xmath5 0.15 mpc , in agreement with previous distance determinations . </S>",
    "<S> the youngest stars are associated with the bright complex of h ii regions ngc 2363 @xmath7 mrk 71 in the southwest extremity of the galaxy . as a consequence of the diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles , </S>",
    "<S> the older the stellar population is , the smoother and more extended is its spatial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> an underlying population of older stars is found throughout the body of ngc 2366 . </S>",
    "<S> the most notable feature of this older population is the presence of numerous relatively bright agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> the number ratio of agb to rgb stars and the average absolute brightness of agb stars in ngc 2366 are appreciably higher than in the bcd vii zw 403 , indicating a younger age of the agb stars in ngc 2366 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the present burst of age @xmath3 100 myr , there has been strong star formation activity in the past of ngc 2366 , from @xmath2 100 myr to @xmath3 3 gyr ago . </S>"
