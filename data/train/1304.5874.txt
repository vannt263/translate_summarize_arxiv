    "this optomechanical coupling is small compared to mechanical frequency and the linewidth of the cavity .",
    "however , if we drive an optical cavity strongly , then the cavity may contain a large number of photons , the coupling between cavity field and mechanical oscillator would be increased by a factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean number of photon in the cavity .",
    "recently , this guides to observe the radiation - pressure effect , for example , normal mode splitting@xcite , optomechanically induced transparency@xcite and sideband colling@xcite .",

    "jaynes - cummings model is the basic model for atom - field interaction .",
    "this model consists of single mode radiation field coupled with two level atoms .",
    "due to presence of strong coupling , the matter - field coupling increased the cavity field decay rate and atomic decay rate@xcite .",
    "the coupled atom - cavity system can leads to a splitting in the atomic fluorescence spectrum and the empty - cavity transmission resonances .",
    "this splitting is known as vacuum - rabi splitting@xcite .",
    "vacuum - rabi splitting can be detected dynamically in population oscillation between two levels when field is resonant on the transition@xcite , as well as in fluorescence spectrum when the initial field strength is very small@xcite and in a cavity transmission function profile at specific transition@xcite . in this work ,",

    "we consider an optomechanical cavity with frequency @xmath2 formed by a fixed end mirror @xmath3 and a moving end mirror @xmath4 .",
    "the mirror @xmath4 can be considered as a harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath5 and frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the oscillator mirror and the cavity are coupled with each other via radiation pressure .",
    "the system is coherently driven by the field @xmath7 with frequency @xmath8 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the cavity decay rate of mirrors are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the rotating frame with driving frequency @xmath8 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian@xcite of the system can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cavity resonance frequency detuning . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity field of frequency @xmath2 with the commutation relation @xmath15=1 $ ] .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the momentum and displacement of the oscillating mirror with mass @xmath5 and frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is coupling strength of the radiation pressure between the mirror and the cavity , which is considered sufficiently weak in this paper .",
    "the input - output theory for a light field interacting with a cavity is given by@xcite @xmath20 the first and second equations determine the reflected and transmitted field of the input and output mirror , using the cavity decay rate @xmath9 and @xmath21    the dynamics of the the system is determined by using the master equation @xmath22+\\mathcal{l}(\\rho ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the lindblad operator .",
    "this is used to model the incoherent decay processes and is given by @xmath24 the cavity mode is damped by photon leakage , which is designed by lindblad term with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total cavity - field decay rate and is given by @xmath27    by using the master equation , the dynamics of the system can be written as @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31    where @xmath32 is damping rate of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "the steady state solution of equations ( 5 - 8 ) can be worked out by putting the time derivative equal to zero .",
    "the steady state solution of these equations leads to @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    here @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are field amplitude and photon number .",
    "these results are very important for the manipulation of transmission and reflection intensity of the filed .",
    "the complex field - transmission and reflection coefficients can be written as @xmath44    @xmath45    intensity - reflection coefficient @xmath46 , @xmath47 intensity - transmission coefficient @xmath48 , @xmath49 by using equation ( 2 ) , we can find @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",

    "the sum of @xmath46 and @xmath48 is equal to 1 .",
    "the cavity intensity transmission and reflection coefficient as a function of driving frequency are shown in fig.2 .",
    "when detuning is zero , the transmission rate arrives at its maximum .",
    "as we increased or decreased the detuning , the transmission rate becomes smaller and smaller . in our work",
    ", we use an approximation , i.e. , @xmath54 .    the condition which ensures the validity of the weak coupling approximation",
    "can be derived from eq.(5 - 8 ) . to make the derivation clear",
    ", we ignore the damping of the harmonic oscillator , i.e. , @xmath55 the weak coupling condition can be found by examining the linear dependence of @xmath56 on the coupling constant @xmath19 . for this purpose",
    ", we ignore the term with @xmath19 in equation ( 8) and have @xmath57 , leading to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the maximum amplitude of oscillation and @xmath60 is the initial phase angle . substituting this result into equation ( 5 ) , we have @xmath61 the resulting @xmath62 clearly is a function of time @xmath53 and @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath63 . to find how @xmath64 linearly depends on @xmath19 , we expand @xmath62 as follows , @xmath65 substituting this expansion into eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we find for the zeroth order of @xmath19 , @xmath66 for first order of @xmath19 , we have @xmath67 after taking integration of equation ( 22 ) and putting the result into equation ( 20 ) , we have @xmath68 clearly , the weak coupling limit means , @xmath69 it is the condition for the validity of weak coupling regime .",
    "fig.3 shows the dynamics of the intensity - transmission coefficient @xmath48 as a function of time . for small value of coupling",
    "constant , our approximation is valid , i.e .",
    "the transmission can reach a steady value as time approaches infinity . as we increased the value of coupling constant from @xmath70 to @xmath71",
    ", there is a large oscillation in transmission @xmath48 , which means our approximation is not valid for strong couplings .",
    "however , if we use damping of movable mirror , then we may consider the strong coupling , because the damping term speed up damping and our system comes to a stationary state very quickly as shown in fig.4 . for steady state result , we plot the ratio of transmission rate at @xmath72 to that of @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 , see fig.5 .",
    "it shows that , for large detuning , transmission rates are independent of coupling constant and their ratio ia almost 1 . for small detuning , however , the coupling constant has very large effect on the transmission rate .",
    "the larger the value of coupling constant , the larger the transmission rate is . for positive detuning , i.e. @xmath75 , transmission rate with coupling is larger than the transmission rate without coupling @xmath76 . for negative detuning , i.e. @xmath77 , transmission rate with coupling is smaller than the transmission rate without coupling , i.e .",
    "in this paper , we study the transmission and reflection rates of an optical cavity , which has a moving mirror and is driven coherently by an external field .",
    "we aim at the effects of the moving mirror on the transmission and reflection .",
    "our analysis is based on the weak mechanical interaction .",
    "we calculated analytically the steady state transmission and reflection coefficients as a function of detuning @xmath79 and of the cavity - mirror coupling constant .",
    "in addition , we show that for small value of coupling constant @xmath19 , our approximation is valid , but it fails to treat the case of strong couplings .",
