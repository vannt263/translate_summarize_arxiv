    "the relationship between the disorders and @xmath7 gives more opportunities to access the central problems in the mechanism of htsc @xcite , and single crystals with high quality are highly desired for such investigations .",
    "it was reported that the bi2201 single crystals could be grown by the self - flux and kcl - solution - melt method @xcite . however , as far as we know , sizeable crystals with high homogeneity and less contamination could be obtained only through the optical travelling - solvent floating - zone ( tsfz ) method @xcite .",

    "so we carried out the edx measurements on each crystal with different doping of la , and obtained the relative percentage for each element in approximate value .",
    "based on the assumption that the proportion of sr : la in the crystals equates to ( 2-@xmath39):@xmath39 , the real doping level of la @xmath39 is deduced and shown in the inset of figure 4(a ) .",

    "unfortunately , the result of post - annealing at 800 @xmath5c is anomalous for all underdoped samples , which gives a much lower @xmath7 and a broader transition .",
    "the `` bell shape '' is distorted in the case of post - annealing at 800 @xmath5c , too . moreover , after post - annealing at 600 @xmath5c again at the final step , the @xmath7 can not return to the magnitude at the first step .",
    "this suggests that the crystal structure may distort at such high temperatures being close to its melting point .",
    "it is more serious in the overdoped regime , since the melting points for these samples are lower than those in the underdoped side .",
    "the @xmath7 after post - annealing at 600 @xmath5c for the final step drops to much lower level , and the long - tail feature in ac susceptibility is also very clear .",
    "furthermore , if we plot the hole concentration @xmath6 for each @xmath7 in the same la doping level , it could be found that the hole concentration related to the oxygen content also varies with different post - annealing temperature [ figure 6(b ) ] , where @xmath6 is determined by the formula from ando .",
