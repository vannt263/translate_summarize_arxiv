    "high temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum @xcite , yttrium @xcite and related copper - oxide compounds remains a subject of intensive investigation and controversy .",
    "it was suggested that electron - phonon interaction mechanism , which is very successful in understanding of conventional (  low temperature \" ) superconductors within the bardeen - cooper - schriffer scheme @xcite , may not be adequate for high-@xmath2 cuprates , and even the conventional fermi liquid model of metallic state may require reconsideration .",
    "this opens an area for investigation of mechanisms of electron - electron interaction which can be relevant in understanding peculiarities of superconducting , as well as normal state , properties of cuprates .",
    "specific to all of them is the existence of oxide orbitals .",
    "band calculations @xcite suggest that hopping between the oxygen @xmath7 orbitals and between the copper @xmath8 orbitals may be of comparable magnitude . on the experimental side , spectroscopic studies @xcite",
    "clearly show that the oxygen band appears in the same region of oxygen concentration in which superconductivity in cuprates is the strongest .",
    "therefore there exists a possibility that specific features of oxide compounds may be related to oxygen - oxygen hopping , or to the interaction between the copper and the rotational @xmath9 collective modes .",
    "if the oxygen hopping is significant then it immediately follows that intrinsic oxygen carriers ( @xmath7 oxygen holes ) should be different from the more familiar generic @xmath10-orbital derived itinerant carriers .",
    "the difference is related to low atomic number of oxygen such that removing or adding of one electron to atom induces a substantial change in the coulomb field near the remaining ion and therefore results in the change of the effective radius of atomic orbitals near the ion .",
    "this will strongly influence the hopping amplitude between this atom and the atoms in its neighborhood .",
    "such `` orbital contraction '' effect represents a source of strong interaction which does not simply reduce to the coulomb ( or phonon ) repulsion ( or attraction ) between the charge carriers .",
    "it was suggested by hirsch and coauthors @xcite , and by the present authors @xcite that the occupation dependent hopping can have relevance to the appearance of superconductivity in high - temperature oxide compounds . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the generic occupation - dependent hopping hamiltonians with respect to peculiarities of the normal state , and to the range of existence of the superconducting state .",
    "theoretical investigation of cooper instability is supplemented by numeric study of pairing and diamagnetic currents in finite atomic clusters .",
    "we study the effect of cooper pairing between the carriers and show that at certain values and magnitudes of the appropriate coupling parameters , the system _ is _ actually superconducting .",
    "the properties of such superconducting state are in fact only slightly different from the properties of conventional ( low-@xmath2 ) superconductors . among those we so far can only mention the change in the fluctuation conductivity above or near the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "relaxation of the pairing parameter to equilibrium acquires a small real part due to the asymmetry of contraction - derived interaction between the quasi - particles above and below the fermi energy .",
    "oxygen atoms in the copper - oxygen layers of the cuprates ( figure 1 ) have simple quadratic lattice .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 orbitals of oxygen ( @xmath12 is the direction perpendicular to the cuprate plane ) are bound to the near cuprate layers whereas carriers at the @xmath7 orbitals may hop between the oxygen ions in the plane .",
    "let @xmath13 be the hopping amplitude of @xmath14 and @xmath15 the hopping amplitude of @xmath16 oxygen orbitals between the nearest lattice sites in the @xmath17 direction in a square lattice with a lattice parameter @xmath18 .",
    "then the non - interacting hamiltonian is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for @xmath21 and correspondingly @xmath22 for @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian includes the terms @xmath24 + \\sum_{<ij > } b_i^{\\dagger}b_j \\left[v n_i n_j + w ( n_i + n_j ) \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "this corresponds to the dependence of the hopping amplitude on the occupation numbers @xmath27 of the form @xmath28 + \\tau_2 m_i m_j\\ ] ] and correspondingly @xmath29 of the same form with @xmath30 replaced with @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath32 correspond to the transitions between the ionic configurations of oxygen : @xmath33 @xmath34 corresponds to the neutral oxygen ion whereas @xmath35 to the single charged and @xmath36 to the double charged negative ions .",
    "since oxygen atom has @xmath37 configuration in its ground state , filling of the @xmath38 shell to the full occupied configuration @xmath39 is the most favorable .",
    "amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 relate to the parameter @xmath32 according to @xmath40 assuming @xmath41 and replacing @xmath42 with @xmath43 with the pseudo - spin indices @xmath44 we write the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 where we also included the in - site coulomb interaction ( u ) between the dissimilar orbitals at the same site .",
    "@xmath47 can also be considered as a real spin projection of electrons at the site . in that case",
    ", the pairing will originate between the spin - up and spin - down orbitals , rather than between @xmath21 and @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "more complex mixed spin -and orbital- pairing configurations can also be possible within the same idea of orbital contraction ( or expansion ) at hole localization but are not considered in this paper .",
    "the following discussion does not distinguish between the real spin and the pseudo - spin pairing .",
    "the hamiltonian , eq.(6 ) , is a model one which can not refer to the reliable values of the parameters appropriate to the oxide materials .",
    "the purpose of our study is rather to investigate the properties of superconducting transition specific to the model chosen and to find the range of the @xmath48 values which may correspond to superconductivity .",
    "this will be done along the lines of the standard bcs model @xcite in the weak coupling limit , @xmath49 , and by an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian for a finite atomic cluster at large and intermediate coupling .    in the momentum representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath54 is the zero order vertex part defined as @xmath55   \\tau_{\\alpha \\beta}^x \\tau_{\\gamma \\delta}^x(\\delta_{\\alpha \\gamma } \\delta_{\\beta \\delta } -   \\delta_{\\alpha \\delta } \\delta_{\\beta \\gamma } ) \\delta_{{\\bf p}_1+{\\bf p}_2 ,   { \\bf p}_3+{\\bf p}_4}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a pauli matrix @xmath57 for reasons which will be clear later , we separated @xmath58 and put some part of it into the @xmath59 term , while the remaining part is included in the @xmath60 term , thus giving @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the average occupation of the site .",
    "the cooper instability realizes at certain temperature @xmath63 as a singularity in a two - particle scattering amplitude at zero total momentum .",
    "let s introduce a function @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the imaginary time @xmath67 creation and annihilation operators . at @xmath68 , @xmath69 ,",
    "the kernel of @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath71 @xmath72 ( @xmath73 is one - electron green function ) .",
    "we keep notation @xmath74 for such a reduced green function specifying only momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 . by assuming temporarily @xmath77 , this hamiltonian results in an equation for the fourier transform @xmath78 @xmath79 corresponding to summation of feynmann graphs shown in figure 2 . in the above formulas , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 integers ) are the discrete odd and even frequencies of the thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath83 is a one - particle green function in a fourier representation @xmath84 diagrams of figure 2 are singular since equal momenta of two parallel running lines bring together singularities of both green functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    6-vertex interaction , eq.(8 ) , is not generally considered in the theories of strongly - correlated fermionic systems .",
    "such interaction also results in singular diagrams for @xmath87 scattering shown in figure 3 .",
    "since a closed loop in this figure does not carry any momentum to the vertex , it reduces to the average value of @xmath88 which in turn is the average of the number operator , @xmath89 .",
    "taking into consideration of such diagrams is equivalent to replacing one of the @xmath31 s in eq.(8 ) to its thermodynamical average @xmath90 .",
    "then the @xmath0 term can be added to the renormalized value of @xmath1 , @xmath91 we will check by numeric analysis in sec .",
    "iii to which extent such an approximation may be justified .",
    "solution to eq.(16 ) can be received by putting @xmath92 substituting this expression into eq.(16 ) and introducing the quantities @xmath93 we receive a system of coupled equations for @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 , which are solved to give @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a determinant @xmath99    the determinant becomes zero at some temperature which means an instability in the two - particle scattering amplitude ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this temperature is the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 . at @xmath2 , eq.(16 )",
    "is singular , which means that two - particle scattering amplitude gets infinite .",
    "below @xmath2 , the finite value of @xmath4 is established by including the non - zero thermal averages ( the order parameters ) , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "we first analyze the case of non - retarded , non - contraction interaction @xmath103 , and after that will consider the effect of the occupation - dependent hopping terms , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .      neglecting contraction parameters @xmath104 ,",
    "solution to eq.(16 ) reduces to @xmath105 which after the summation over the discrete frequencies reduces to the conventional bcs equation ( at negative @xmath103 ) @xmath106 with @xmath107 . at finite frequency @xmath108 , eq.(23 ) reduces to @xmath109 where we replaced for simplicity an integration over the brillouin , zone @xmath110 , by the integration over the energy assuming that the density of states near the fermi energy @xmath53 is flat .",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 are the lower and upper limits of integration equal to @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "such an approximation is not very bad since most singular contribution to integral comes from the point @xmath115 where the integrand is the largest .    above @xmath2 ,",
    "eq.(25 ) determines the frequency of the order parameter relaxation @xcite .",
    "there is a small change in this frequency compared to the bcs model in which limits of the integration @xmath116 are symmetric with respect to the fermi energy , and small in comparison to @xmath117 , therefore we briefly discuss it now .    to receive a real - time relaxation frequency ,",
    "eq.(25 ) needs to be analytically continued to a real frequency domain from the discrete imaginary frequencies @xmath118 @xcite . using the identity @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a fermi function @xmath121 gives @xmath122 where @xmath123 @xmath124 is euler constant .",
    "analytic continuation is now simple : we change @xmath108 to @xmath125 , @xmath126 , to receive a function which will be analytic in the upper half plane of complex @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "the order parameter relaxation equation becomes @xmath129 at @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the real and imaginary parts of eq.(29 ) are easily evaluated to give @xmath132 thus , the order parameter relaxation equation at @xmath133 becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 in comparison to the bcs theory in which @xmath136 ( @xmath137 is the debye frequency ) and therefore @xmath138 , we receive the relaxation which has a non - zero `` inductive '' component , @xmath139 .",
    "typically , @xmath140 and therefore @xmath141 is a small quantity .",
    "it increases however near the low ( @xmath142 ) or near the maximal ( @xmath143 ) occupation where @xmath144 or @xmath112 become small .",
    "such mode of relaxation is specific to a non - retarded ( non - phonon ) interaction which is not symmetric near @xmath117 and spans over the large volume of the @xmath145-space rather than is restricted to a narrow energy @xmath146 near the fermi energy .",
    "neglecting direct interaction , we put @xmath147 in eq.(22 ) and receive @xmath148 where at finite frequency @xmath127 @xmath149 putting @xmath150 we receive from eq.(33 ) a transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the equation has a solution at @xmath151 , @xmath152 , or at @xmath153 , @xmath154 ( we assume that @xmath155 ) . plus or minus sign is chosen to receive the maximal value of @xmath2 ( the second solution corresponding to smaller @xmath156 , then , has to be disregarded since at @xmath157 the order parameter will be finite and therefore eqs.(20)-(22 ) do not apply ) .",
    "this gives an expression for @xmath2 @xmath158   \\exp \\left(-\\frac{t}{2|\\tilde{w}|n(\\varepsilon_f)}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath159 , @xmath160 ( second exponent is dominating the first one in the weak coupling limit @xmath161 )",
    ". real and imaginary parts of @xmath162 are calculated at @xmath130 @xmath163 equation for @xmath164 is received with a value larger than the previous one ( eq.(32 ) ) @xmath165 eigenvalue equation gives the @xmath166-dependence of the two particle correlator @xmath167 near @xmath2 @xmath168.\\ ] ] since @xmath124 diverges at @xmath2 , this determines that order parameter becomes macroscopic at @xmath157 .",
    "then , the pair creation operator , @xmath169 , will almost be a number , i.e. , we may decompose eq.(39 ) into a product @xmath170 and , to be consistent with the @xmath166 , @xmath171 dependences , by putting @xmath172 we receive @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 is an overall phase which is irrelevant for a single superconductor but is important for calculating currents in multiple or weakly coupled superconductors .",
    "therefore , system undergoes a pairing transition at temperature found from the eq.(35 ) .",
    "since the pairs are charged , the state below @xmath2 can not be non - superconducting .",
    "we have not calculated the meissner response but in the following section we present numerical calculation of flux quantization which supports the above statement .",
    "we calculate the ground state energy of a cubic system as shown in figure 4 . a magnetic flux @xmath176 is produced by a solenoid passing through the cube .",
    "corners of the cube are the lattice sites , which can be occupied by electrons . with the inclusion of the magnetic flux , model hamiltonian , eq .",

    "we start with constructing the model hamiltonian . in a hilbert space of one electron @xmath181 with a basis specified as @xmath182 for the ground state ( @xmath183 ) and @xmath184 for the excited state ( @xmath185 ) . in case of @xmath186 states operator of annihilation @xmath187",
    "takes the form @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the unit matrix and @xmath10 is unitary matrix @xmath190 and @xmath191 stands for the kronecker matrix multiplication .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath192 thus , for example , for two states @xmath193 these matrices , which are annihilation operators , and corresponding hermitian conjugate matrices , which are the creation operators , satisfy the fermi anti - commutation relation .",
    "these operators are sparse matrices with only @xmath194 non - zero elements , which are equal to @xmath195 .",
    "next we solve the schrdinger equation @xmath196 .",
    "we implemented a novel algorithm for solving such sparse systems , which will be described elsewhere .",
    "the cubic cluster within the hubbard hamiltonian and no external flux applied to the system was studied previously by callaway et .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods applicable to large systems within the hubbard model ( both attractive and repulsive ) , but not the occupation - dependent hopping hamiltonians , are reviewed in a paper of dagotto @xcite .",
    "superconductivity reveals itself in the lowering of the ground state energy as electrons get paired .",
    "therefore the energy needs to be minimal for even number of electrons @xmath197 and will attain a larger value when @xmath197 is odd .",
    "we consider a  gap \" parameter @xcite @xmath198 as a possible  signature \" of superconductivity ( where @xmath199 corresponds to the ground state energy for @xmath200 fermions ) .",
    "for all interaction parameters set to zero ( @xmath201 ) , no sign of pairing is observed . to check our analytic results of sec .",
    "iib and the argument following eq.(34 ) , we calculated @xmath5 above and below the half - filling ( @xmath202 in case of cubic cluster ) .",
    "below the half - filling chemical potential is negative ( @xmath159 ) and above the half - filling it is positive ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "we first checked that the @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , @xmath206 calculation is consistent with an exact solution available for a non - interacting system of @xmath197 electrons .",
    "we then test our program for the case of negative-@xmath103 hubbard hamiltonian ( @xmath207 ) which is known to be superconducting ( e.g. refs .",
    "positive-@xmath103 hubbard model does not show any sign of superconductivity , in disagreement with some statements in the literature @xcite .",
    "our calculations can not disprove the ( possible ) non - pairing mechanisms of superconductivity but these seem to be unlikely models for the problem of superconductivity in oxides which clearly shows pairing of electrons ( holes ) in the josephson effect and in the abrikosov vortices .",
    "the relation @xmath208 is justified in the first case @xcite and flux quantum of a vortex is @xmath209 in the second @xcite , both with the value of the charge equal to twice the electronic charge , @xmath189 .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the ground state energy upon the number of particles in case of negative-@xmath103 and positive-@xmath103 hubbard models assuming @xmath77 and @xmath210 .",
    "such dependences are typical for any value of @xmath211 .",
    "there clearly is the pairing effect when @xmath212 and there is no sign of pairing at @xmath6 .",
    "tests for pairing in the contraction @xmath0 , @xmath1-models ( @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively ) are shown in figs .",
    "the results are in agreement with our perturbative calculation of sec .",
    "ii and with its extension for the intermediate and strong coupling limits @xmath215 , @xmath216 . since",
    "chemical potential is negative below the half - filling and positive above the half - filling , there is no pairing in the former case ( @xmath217 ) and there is a sign of pairing in the latter case ( @xmath218 ) , in accord with the value of the effective coupling constant @xmath219 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath220 below the half - filling there is a sign of pairing ( @xmath221 ) while above the half - filling there is no pairing .",
    "these results are summarized in table 1 .    for larger values of the interaction parameters ,",
    "the perturbative results do not remain applicable anymore .",
    "figure 8b shows the dependence of the parity gap @xmath5 on the strength of the interaction . from figure 8",
    "it is understood that the @xmath1 interaction introduces a  signature \" of pairing in a similar way as the negative-@xmath103 interaction does .",
    "the possibility of the  contraction \" pairing has been investigated formerly in the papers @xcite .",
    "flux quantization is another signature of superconductivity which is a consequence of the meissner effect .",
    "we also tested for the periodicity of the energy versus flux dependence with the period @xmath222 as compared to the period @xmath179 in the non - interacting system @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the even harmonics of @xmath223-periodic dependence of the ground state energy ( and related to it , the harmonics of the persistent current @xmath224 @xcite ) may simulate the pairing in a non - superconductive system .",
    "small - size ( mesoscopic ) system can mask the superconducting behavior @xcite .",
    "flux quantization in hubbard hamiltonians was studied formerly in refs .",
    "29 - 31 .",
    "we first demonstrate the behavior of the ground state energy with respect to flux , figure 9 .",
    "a characteristic feature of mesoscopic system suggests that addition of one extra particle to the system changes the sign of the derivative of the ground state energy with respect to magnetic flux at @xmath225 . that is , depending on the parity of the number of particles and on the number of sites , system can change from paramagnetic to diamagnetic state or vice versa . but",
    "this behavior is not always observed for the cubic geometry studied . except the sign change from @xmath226 to @xmath227 and from @xmath228 to @xmath202 ,",
    "no such behavior is seen . as mentioned above",
    ", however , the @xmath229-periodic component of the @xmath230 dependence begins to appear at the higher value of @xmath197 ( figure 9,c ) . for both contraction parameters equal to zero , i.e. @xmath231 , we observe appearance of the @xmath209-periodic component for some values of @xmath103 ( figure 10 ) . even for positive ( repulsive ) values of @xmath103 ,",
    "it is possible to see a local minimum appearing at @xmath232 ( figure 10b ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the authors previous works @xcite . but",
    "this minimum , which does not lead to an exact periodicity of the ground state energy with a period @xmath233 , should not be attributed to superconductivity , this is rather a characteristic behavior in mesoscopic systems .    for @xmath212 ( while @xmath231 ) , the expected mesoscopic behavior , that is the change of the sign of the slope of ground state energy at @xmath225 , starts to demonstrate itself ( figure 11 ) .",
    "but this happens at sufficiently large absolute values of ( negative ) @xmath103 .",
    "for other values of @xmath103 , however , there is no such change .",
    "more pronounced @xmath209-periodic components are observed with the introduction of non - zero interaction parameters .",
    "the role of @xmath1 on the ground state energy , when both @xmath103 and @xmath0 are zero , is shown in figure 12 .",
    "meanwhile setting both @xmath103 and @xmath1 to zero and observing the effect of the non - zero @xmath0 shows that @xmath0 does not play a role as significant as the other two interaction parameters do .",
    "there is not much difference in the behavior of the ground state energy upon magnetic flux between the zero and non - zero @xmath0 ( for example @xmath234 ) cases .",
    "we studied the peculiarity of electron conduction in systems in which conduction band is derived from the atomic shells with a small number of electrons ( @xmath235 ) in an atom .",
    "such materials may include oxygen ( @xmath236 ) in the oxides , carbon ( @xmath237 ) in borocarbides ( e.g. @xmath238 ) , hydrogen ( @xmath239 ) in some metals ( e.g. , @xmath240 ) .",
    "some materials of this kind are superconductors .",
    "it was argued that the coulomb effects within the atoms strongly influence the inter - atom wave function overlap between the atomic sites and therefore the electron hopping amplitude between the sites .",
    "the phenomenology of such conduction mechanism results in a novel , to the conventional solid state theory , hamiltonians called the occupation - dependent - hopping ( or contraction ) hamiltonians , specified with the two coupling parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "we then attempted a study of superconductivity in such systems within the bcs - type approach assuming the cooper pairing of electrons .",
    "the weak - coupling limit allows determination of the range of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 values and also of the in - site coulomb interaction @xmath103 value which show the cooper instability .",
    "the strong - coupling limit was addressed by a numeric calculation on finite clusters using the novel algorithm ( of non - lanczos type ) for eigenvalues of large sparse matrices .",
    "one of the results of this numeric calculation was that the positive-@xmath103 hubbard model , sometimes believed to be a candidate for high-@xmath2 superconductivity , does not comply with the goal .",
