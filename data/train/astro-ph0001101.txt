    "for dating globular clusters and several other important problems ( e.g. , measuring distances to population ii objects ) , it is essential to know the luminosity of the rr lyrae stars , m@xmath10(rr ) , and how it varies with metal abundance ( see sandage 1990b ; lee , demarque , and zinn 1990 , hereafter ldz ) .",
    "the variation of m@xmath10(rr ) with [ fe / h ] affects the age - metallicity relation of the galactic globular cluster system , and thus provides constraints on the scenarios of the galaxy formation .",
    "however , due to the variety of different techniques used , the particular data set chosen , and the reddening corrections adopted , there is no consensus on the size of the dependency of m@xmath10(rr ) upon [ fe / h ] ( layden et al .",
    "1996 ) . to investigate and resolve the problem of the dependence of m@xmath10(rr ) on [ fe / h ]",
    ", one needs a large sample of rr lyrae stars , spanning a wide range of [ fe / h ] , for which precise measurements of relative luminosity and [ fe / h ] exist .",
    "the rr lyrae stars in @xmath0 cen are an ideal sample for this study . in @xmath0 cen",
    ", there is a wide range in [ fe / h ] , and clearly the relative values of m@xmath10(rr ) can be inferred straightforwardly from their mean apparent visual magnitudes since they are all located at the same distance and are all reddened by the same amount .",
    "however , investigations by freeman & rodgers(1975 ) , butler et al .",
    "( 1978 , hereafter bde ) , sandage ( 1982 ) , and gratton et al .",
    "( 1986 , hereafter gto ) have revealed that the m@xmath10(rr ) - [ fe / h ] correlation in @xmath0 cen is peculiar : a few metal - rich @xmath11 } >   -1.1)$ ] rr lyrae stars in their sample are fainter than the more metal - poor ones , but no obvious correlation exists among the metal - poor @xmath12 < -1.4)$ ] rr lyrae stars .",
    "this and the lack of a period - shift - [ fe / h ] correlation amongst the variables was recognized by sandage ( 1982 ) as a possible contradiction to his steep correlation between m@xmath10(rr ) and [ fe / h ] . in general",
    "these `` discrepant '' observational results were simply considered to be yet another anomaly of the stellar population of @xmath0 cen ( see also smith 1995 ) .",
    "recent advances in our understanding of the evolution of horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars are throwing new light on this long - standing problem .",
    "in particular , the hb evolutionary models by lee ( 1990 ) suggest that m@xmath10(rr ) depends on hb morphology as well as metallicity , especially when the hb morphology is extremely blue , due to the effect of redward evolution off the zero - age horizontal - branch ( zahb ) . using these model calculations ,",
    "lee ( 1991 ) has shown that the observed nonlinear behavior of m@xmath10(rr ) with [ fe / h ] in @xmath0 cen is not something peculiar , but is in fact predicted .",
    "the detailed model calculations suggest that two effects are responsible for the observed behavior of m@xmath10(rr ) with [ fe / h ] in @xmath0 cen , and are : ( 1 ) the abrupt increase in m@xmath10(rr ) near [ fe / h ] = -1.5 as rr lyrae stars become highly evolved stars from the blue side of the instability strip as hb morphology gets bluer with decreasing [ fe / h ] , and ( 2 ) the nonmonotonic behavior of the hb morphology with decreasing [ fe / h ] , which together with the first effect makes the correlation between m@xmath10(rr ) and [ fe / h ] looks like a step function , because m@xmath10(rr ) depends sensitively on hb morphology . despite the lack of a complete understanding of why hb morphology changes",
    "as it does , the definite conclusions from lee s ( 1991 ) work are : ( 1 ) the correlation between m@xmath10(rr ) and [ fe / h ] in the halo of our galaxy is probably not linear due to the effect of hb morphology ( evolution ) . ( 2 ) the use of a simple linear relationship between m@xmath10(rr ) and [ fe / h ] in deriving the distances to blue hb clusters should be avoided .",
    "this suggests that when the distances to the population ii objects are to be estimated using the rr lyrae stars , the hb type of the stellar population , as well as metallicity , must be known .",
    "although the @xmath0 cen data do appear to support this model , a definite conclusion was not possible because of the uncertainty in [ fe / h ] and of the lack of metal - rich stars in the available data . in order to provide a more complete and homogeneous sample of rr lyrae stars with relatively well - measured metallicity , we obtained [ fe / h ] abundances for most of the rr lyrae stars in @xmath0 cen , using the @xmath2 photometric system .",
    "the @xmath2 photometric system is an expansion of the standard @xmath13 system with the inclusion of a fifth filter , @xmath14 , centered on the k and h lines of ca ii ( 90 @xmath15 fwhm ) .",
    "the @xmath1 index is defined as @xmath1 = @xmath16 , and is found to be much more sensitive to metal abundance than the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 @xmath20 index ( anthony - twarog et al .",
    "1991 ; twarog & anthony - twarog 1991 , 1995 ; anthony - twarog & twarog 1998 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath1 index to metallicity changes is high at all [ fe / h ] for hotter stars and also for cooler stars more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] = -1.0 .",
    "it is about three times more sensitive than the @xmath20 index ( see fig",
    ". 9 of twarog & anthony - twarog 1995 ) .",
    "baird ( 1996 , hereafter b96 ) extended @xmath2 photometry to rr lyrae stars of known metallicity and showed that the @xmath1 index retains good sensitivity even at the hottest phases of pulsation .",
    "it was demonstrated that isometallicity lines formed in the @xmath21 diagram are single valued with respect to both @xmath22 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath21 diagram gives consistent metallicities throughout a star s pulsational cycle , including during rising light and near maximum light , when @xmath3@xmath4 results are unreliable , and so precise knowledge of light curve phase is unnecessary .",
    "an additional advantage of the photometric approach is that standard crowded - field techniques can be used to measure stars even in rich cluster centers .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a new @xmath2 photometric survey of 131 rr lyrae stars in @xmath0 cen , from which metal abundances are derived via the @xmath1 index . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and the reduction procedures .",
    "the adopted metallicity calibration procedures are outlined in section 3 . in section 4 , we present the results of our metallicity determination for field rr lyrae stars and @xmath0 cen rr lyrae stars , with a comparison with the previous @xmath3@xmath4 measurements .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss the impact of our new metallicity measurements on the m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h ] and period - shift - [ fe / h ] relations .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram resulting from the @xmath2 photometry , and a discussion of the metallicity distribution of giant branch stars will be presented in a future paper of this series .",
    "all the observations were made using the ctio 0.9 m telescope and tektronix 2048 no .",
    "3 ccd during three nights of an observing run in march 1997 .",
    "we covered @xmath0 cen in a 3 @xmath23 3 grid and observed one sequence of this grid per each night .",
    "the field size of each grid point was 13@xmath24.6 @xmath23 13@xmath24.6 with a pixel scale of 0@xmath25.40 .",
    "our program field , centered on the cluster , covers approximately 40@xmath24 @xmath23 40@xmath24 which roughly corresponds to the area enclosed within the half tidal radius of @xmath0 cen .",
    "typical exposure times were 1400 s for @xmath14 , 360 s for @xmath26 , and 180 s for @xmath27 , with the ccd being read out simultaneously through all four amplifiers , using an arcon ccd controller . the observation log for the program fields",
    "is presented in table 1 .",
    "two to four frames were taken in each band and each field .",
    "the frames were calibrated from twilight or dawn sky flats and zero - level exposures , using the iraf quadproc routines .",
    "calibration frames were made by combining several individual exposures .",
    "all exposure times were sufficiently long that the center - to - corner shutter timing error was negligible . these procedures produced object frames with the sky flat to better than 1% in all filters .",
    "the iraf routine cosmicrays was used to remove nearly all of the cosmic ray events in each frame , with conservative parameters set to avoid corrupting the stellar profiles .",
    "photometry of @xmath0 cen stars was accomplished using daophot ii and allstar ( stetson 1987 , 1995 ) . for each frame , a moffat function psf , varying cubically with radial position , was constructed using 100 to 200 bright , isolated , and unsaturated stars .",
    "the psf was improved iteratively by subtracting faint nearby companions of the psf stars .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated using the program daogrow ( stetson 1990 ) .",
    "the final aperture correction were made by adjusting the allstar magnitude of all stars by the weighted mean of the difference between the total aperture magnitude and the profile - fitting allstar magnitude for selected stars ( e.g. , psf stars ) .",
    "after the aperture correction , we used daomatch / daomaster ( stetson 1992 ) to match stars of all frames covering the same field , and derived the average instrumental magnitude and colors on the same photometric scale . for each frame , the magnitude offset with respect to each master frame in @xmath14 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 was calculated , and photometry for the two to four frames for the same field was transformed to a common instrumental system .    on each night",
    ", five to seven standards from the list of twarog & anthony - twarog ( 1995 ) were observed , and due to the small sample size the results for each night were combined .",
    "comparison of the instrumental magnitudes for the final 15 observations in each filter with the standard values allowed the construction of linear transformations for the observed @xmath27 , @xmath22 , and @xmath1 magnitudes from the instrumental to the standard system .",
    "the standard stars observed cover a color range of 0.1 - 0.7 and 0.2 - 1.4 for @xmath22 and @xmath1 , respectively , and an air mass range of 1.0 - 1.6 .",
    "extinction coefficients for all the filters were determined by a series of standard stars over a wide range of airmass .",
    "the final transformation equations were obtained by a linear least - square fit .",
    "they are @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath22 , @xmath1 , and @xmath27 are the color indices and visual magnitude in the standard @xmath2 system , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 refer to instrumental magnitudes corrected for extinction .",
    "no other trends in the residuals were noticeable , and therefore no additional terms in the transformation equations appear to be necessary .",
    "the calibration equations relate observed to standard values for @xmath27 , @xmath22 , and @xmath1 with standard deviations of 0.01 , 0.01 , and 0.02 , respectively . during the observing",
    "runs , six field rr lyrae `` standard '' stars ( four rr@xmath6 stars and two rr@xmath34 stars ) were observed in order to make a comparison between our result and that of b96 , as discussed in the next section . throughout ,",
    "we have corrected for reddening using the reddening ratios , @xmath35 = 0.75 , @xmath36 = -0.1 , adopted by b96 .",
    "b96 successfully provided the [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath37 calibrations for two values of @xmath38 = 0.15 and 0.30 , from eight rr@xmath6 stars and two rr@xmath34 stars . using these relations ,",
    "it is possible to determine the metallicity of any rr lyrae star for which there is @xmath2 photometry at either of these colors .",
    "however , in order to find the metallicity of rr lyrae stars at arbitrary phase , it is necessary to find the relations between [ fe / h ] and @xmath37 for various values of @xmath38 and ultimately produce a set of isometallicity lines that are continuous across the full range of @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to two calibrations for @xmath38 = 0.15 and 0.30 , baird & anthony - twarog ( 1999 ) added a new set of calibrations for a more complete grid of @xmath38 values [ i.e. , @xmath38 = 0.20 , 0.25 , and 0.35 ] from high - quality photometric data for 14 rr@xmath6 stars , combined with previous data from b96 . as did b96 , the metallicity values of layden ( 1994 )",
    "were adopted because they provide a uniform set of values for all the field rr@xmath6 stars , and they are based on the zinn & west ( 1984 ; hereafter zw ) metallicity scale for galactic globular clusters .",
    "layden s ( 1994 ) metallicities for rr@xmath6 stars are based on the relative strengths of the ca ii k line and the h@xmath39 , h@xmath40 , and h@xmath41 balmer lines .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values of the rr@xmath34 stars were adopted from kemper ( 1982 ) and transformed to the zw scale with layden s ( 1994 ) equation . in the following discussion",
    ", we will denote [ fe / h]@xmath42 as the metallicity measured spectroscopically for rr@xmath6 and rr@xmath34 standard stars used in our calibration .",

    ". the @xmath44 values are highest at the extreme colors , i.e. , at @xmath38 = 0.15 and 0.35 , where the number of calibrating points is lowest .",
    "figure 1 shows the derived [ fe / h]@xmath5 vs. @xmath37 relations for five values of @xmath38 , along with the photometric indices for 14 field rr lyrae stars that define the relations . at warmer temperatures ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath37 to [ fe / h]@xmath5 drops , and the slope in a [ fe / h]@xmath5 vs. @xmath37 relation becomes steeper .",
    "when stars get hotter than @xmath38 = 0.25 , the slopes of the [ fe / h]@xmath5 vs. @xmath37 relations are nearly the same , indicating that [ fe / h]@xmath5 is a function of @xmath37 only , as suggested by b96 .",
    "@xmath2 photometry is useful for stars as blue as @xmath38 = 0.10 , but at higher temperatures the sensitivity of @xmath2 photometry to metallicity will certainly decrease , and the contamination by the h@xmath45 line line should become quite substantial ( baird & anthony - twarog 1999 ) .    we have calculated the metal abundance of the rr lyrae stars in the field and @xmath0 cen using the above [ fe / h]@xmath5 vs. @xmath37 relations .",
    "additional [ fe / h]@xmath5 vs. @xmath37 relations were derived as necessary by interpolating these relations within the range of 0.15 @xmath9 @xmath38 @xmath9 0.35 . however , for stars with @xmath38 @xmath9 0.15 , which lie outside the limits of the current [ fe / h]@xmath5 vs. @xmath37 relations , we applied the relation for @xmath38 = 0.15 because at these warm temperatures the isometallicity lines are horizontal in the @xmath46 diagram , as described above .",

    "the reason for the large deviation of au vir is not clear , however it anticipates the difficulties we have with the @xmath3@xmath4 measurements for the @xmath0 cen rr@xmath34 stars , discussed below in sections 4.3 and 4.5 .",
    "using the ctio 4 m telescope in 1997 december , walker ( 1999 ) observed 14 @xmath2 standard stars and three rr@xmath6 stars ( u lep , ry col , hh pup ) from b96 s list .",

    "we also found that metallicity residuals between [ fe / h]@xmath5 and [ fe / h]@xmath52 showed a similar pattern for the inner and outer regions of our program field , demonstrating that there is no dependency on image crowding .",
    "we discuss supporting evidence for there being large errors in the @xmath51 measurements of bde and gto .",
    "first of all , the excellent agreement between [ fe / h]@xmath5 and [ fe / h]@xmath42 , which is compatible to the @xmath51 measurements ( see layden 1994 ) , of four field rr@xmath6 stars provides the most positive evidence of the accuracy of the present work and the large error of the @xmath51 results of bde and gto ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "second , there are non - negligible discrepancies between the results of bde and gto .",
    "gto claimed that the internal errors are about 0.2 dex in both bde and gto @xmath51 measurements , and their system is thus not far from the standard @xmath51 system .",
    "however , as gto already noted , a few stars ( v32 , v39 , and v72 ) show large deviation ( more than 0.5 dex ) with bde s results , probably , due to observation at phases far from the minimum ( see fig . 2 of gto ) .",
    "furthermore , the rms scatter of the mean difference of the @xmath51 measurements between bde and gto corresponds to 0.34 dex , certainly not negligible .",
    "third , j98 obtained an unexpectedly large ( 0.52 dex ) rms scatter between her empirical metallicity values and @xmath51 metallicity of bde , but comparing empirical data with gto s observations , a smaller 0.38 dex rms scatter was obtained .",
    "therefore , it is suspected that the @xmath51 measurements for @xmath0 cen , especially bde s data , are inaccurate . both of the empirical metallicities obtained from j98 and sk98 show smaller rms scatter in our [ fe / h]@xmath5 than in @xmath51 metallicity , [ fe / h]@xmath52 ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "this suggests that our [ fe / h]@xmath5 are more accurate than the [ fe / h]@xmath52 of bde and gto .",
    "fourth , despite a more extensive sample than that of previous @xmath51 observations , the relation between magnitude and metallicity of our observations show a smaller scatter .",
    "we also note consistency with the model predictions of lee ( 1991 ) ( see section 5.1 and fig .",
    "6 ) . finally , as we will see in section 4.6 , the metallicity distribution of our observations for rr@xmath6 stars is more consistent with that of the giant stars of suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 , hereafter sk ) , rather than that of the previous @xmath51 observations .",
    "it was also suggested by sk that the large population of very metal - poor stars found from @xmath3@xmath4 measurements is incorrect . according to stellar evolution theory , the rr lyrae stars are an intrinsically abundance - biased population due to the low probability that the extremely metal - rich ( -poor ) red ( blue ) hb stars evolve through the instability strip ( lee & demarque 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , it is unreasonable to expect that the metallicity distribution of rr lyrae stars is wider than that of their progenitor stars .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the systematic discrepancies between our [ fe / h]@xmath5 and the [ fe / h]@xmath52 of bde and gto are caused by the large uncertainties of the @xmath51 measurements .    finally , we discuss the difference in metallicity distribution in our results between the rr@xmath6 and rr@xmath34 stars .",
    "our distribution of metal - rich rr@xmath34 stars is difficult to understand from the standpoint of standard metal - rich hb evolutionary tracks , which do not penetrate into the hotter regions of the instability strip ( lee & demarque 1990 ) .",
    "while no definite resolution on the disagreement in the metallicity can be offered , we suggest that the metal enhancement of rr@xmath34 stars may be due to the possible contamination of ca ii h by h@xmath45 . for hotter stars , inclusion of the h@xmath45 feature will weaken the metallicity effect because the weakening of the ca ii h line can be partially compensated by the growth of the balmer line ( anthony - twarog et al .",
    "although we used the [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath37 relation at @xmath38 = 0.15 for stars with @xmath38 @xmath9 0.15 ( see section 3 ) , we should treat this data with caution until the [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath37 relations at higher temperatures are confirmed .",
    "furthermore , because the [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath37 relation at high temperature [ e.g. , @xmath38 = 0.15 ] , as shown in fig . 1 , does not extend to metallicity higher than [ fe / h ] = -1.0 , the metal - rich end of the rr@xmath34 stars may also be suspect .",
    "more calibration data for rr@xmath34 stars will be needed to resolve this problem .",
    "for this reason , we regard our results for rr@xmath34 stars to be tentative , and we will restrict our analysis to rr@xmath6 stars in the following discussions .      considering the homogeneity and large sample size of the present database ,",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate the metallicity distribution of rr lyrae stars and compare it with the earlier results for rr lyrae stars and giant stars ( bde ; dickens 1989 ; norris et al . 1996 ;",
    "however , care must be taken when comparing the metallicity distribution of rr lyrae stars and giant stars , since as mentioned above rr lyrae stars are intrinsically an abundance - biased sample due to the failure of the extremely metal - rich red hb stars to penetrate into the instability strip .",
    "furthermore , the frequency of rr lyrae stars at a given metallicity depends on the hb morphology as well as the metallicity distribution of the underlying stellar population ( e.g. , lee 1992 and walker & terndrup 1991 for rr lyrae stars in baade s window ) .",
    "figure 5 presents the metallicity distributions for the rr@xmath6 stars and giant stars .",
    "all of the earlier studies and our results agree on the non - gaussian shape of the metallicity distribution which contains a sharp rise from the low metallicity side , a modal value of [ fe / h ] @xmath59 -1.8 and a tail of metal - rich stars reaching at least [ fe / h ] @xmath59 -0.9 .",
    "for the 161 - star bright giant ( bg ) sample and the 199 - star subgiant ( sgb ) sample of sk ( fig .",
    "5c ) , the metallicity distribution is narrower than that of 34 - star rr@xmath6 sample obtained from the @xmath3@xmath4 method ( fig .",
    "sk suggested that the large population of very metal - poor stars found in the @xmath3@xmath4 measurement is due to the large rms error of 0.4 dex of the old @xmath3@xmath4 study and probably the strong low - metallicity tail of the error distribution is spurious . the more complete sample of rr@xmath6 stars from our @xmath1 method ( fig .",
    "5b ) also shows the paucity of very metal - poor stars .",
    "consequently , contrary to the case of the @xmath51 observations , the range of the metallicity distribution of our observations for rr@xmath6 stars is consistent with that of the giant stars of sk .",
    "while a detailed discussion of the origin of the abundance distribution is outside the scope of this paper , we wish to point out that in the analysis of a @xmath60 cmd for @xmath0 cen containing 130,000 stars , lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found several distinct red giant branches ( rgbs ) .",
    "they also showed from population models that the most metal - rich rgb is about 2 gyr younger than the dominant metal - poor component , suggesting that @xmath0 cen has enriched itself over this timescale .",
    "an extensive study of the metallicity distribution for an homogeneous and nearly complete sample of @xmath0 cen giant branch stars , now underway , will place this result on a firmer footing .",
    "the rr lyrae stars , being clearly representatives of the oldest populations in @xmath0 cen , will be an important part of any enrichment model for the cluster .",
    "given our homogeneous metallicity measurements for nearly the whole sample of @xmath0 cen rr lyrae stars , we can turn to a discussion of the magnitude - metallicity relation .",
    "we will use the intensity mean magnitude values , @xmath61 , given in bde and kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997b ) . for the stars",
    "whose @xmath61 values are available from both sources the mean values have been adopted .",
    "column ( 7 ) of table 5 lists the @xmath61 for each rr lyrae stars . while the photometry of bde is restricted to the outer region of the cluster , that of kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997b ) covers a larger area including the central region from their extensive observations ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a ) .",
    "although kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have claimed field - to - field differences on the level of a few hundredth s of magnitude and uncertainties when combining photometry obtained in different fields for the same variables , we adopted the averaged value of magnitude for stars with multiple entries in their table 1 . from intercomparison of 66 rr lyrae stars between bde and kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , we found a zeropoint offset of @xmath61 as -0.03 @xmath62 0.06 in the sense bde minus kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "however , considering the intrinsic spread ( or scatter ) and random error of @xmath61 for @xmath0 cen rr lyrae stars , this small offset would have only a small or negligible effect on the discussion of the m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h ] relation .",
    "we are presently reducing @xmath63 photometry for @xmath0 cen rr lyrae stars , which in the future will provide a more homogeneous and consistent dataset of @xmath61 .    using the data in table 5 , the observed correlation between m@xmath7(rr ) and [ fe / h ] is presented in figure 6 , where panel ( a ) is based on [ fe / h ] determined by the previous @xmath3@xmath4 measurements while panel ( b ) is based on our new @xmath2 photometry . in the transformation to the absolute magnitude",
    ", we adopted a distance modulus of v - m@xmath7 = 14.1 based on the recent evolutionary models of m@xmath7(rr ) by demarque et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in fig . 6b",
    ", closed circles are stars which overlap with the sample of bde and gto ( i.e. , fig .",
    "6a ) , while triangles represent stars only observed in our study .",
    "the large symbols are for stars with smaller observational error ( @xmath49@xmath50}$ ] @xmath54 0.2 dex ) of the [ fe / h]@xmath5 with the same criterion of fig .",
    "it appears that the random errors of [ fe / h]@xmath5 are smaller than those of [ fe / h]@xmath52 in the m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h ] distribution . in particular , v5 ( [ fe / h]@xmath52 = -2.32 ) and v56 ( [ fe / h]@xmath52 = -1.82 ) , which are fainter ( about 0.2 mag . ) than similarly metal - poor rr lyrae stars in the m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h]@xmath52 diagram , are moved to relatively metal - rich [ fe / h]@xmath5 .",
    "their new metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 = -1.35 and -1.26 ) are more consistent with their intrinsic luminosity , following a general trend shown in fig . 6b .    we have superimposed the model correlations of lee ( 1991 ) , which were constructed based on his hb population models under two assumptions regarding the variation of hb type with metallicity .",
    "the solid ( age = 13.5 gyr ) and short - dashed ( age = 15.0 gyr ) lines are for the case that the hb type follows the nonmonotonic behavior with decreasing [ fe / h ] similar to that observed in the galactic globular cluster system [ see fig . 3 of lee ( 1991 ) ] .",
    "lee ( 1991 ) suggested that this nonmonotonic behavior of hb morphology is perhaps due either to the highly nonlinear relationship between mass loss and [ fe / h ] or to some combination of the effects of mass loss and enhanced @xmath64-elements , although the complete understanding is still lacking .",
    "the long - dashed line is a simple model locus , with fixed mass loss , age , and @xmath64-elements , which fails to reproduce the observed nonmonotonic behavior of hb type with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "the sudden upturn in m@xmath7(rr ) of model loci can be explained by a series of hb population models ( see fig .",
    "5 of lee 1993 ) , where one can see how sensitively the population of the instability strip changes with decreasing [ fe / h ] . as [ fe / h ]",
    "decreases , there is a certain point where the zero age portion of the hb just crosses the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "then , only highly evolved stars from the blue hb can penetrate back into the instability strip , and the mean rr lyrae luminosity increases abruptly ( lee 1993 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "6b , the correlation predicted from the model loci , including the sudden upturn in m@xmath7(rr ) , agree better with our new m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h]@xmath5 distribution .",
    "note that the choice of hb evolutionary tracks has little effect on this conclusion , as demarque et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently showed that new synthetic hb models based on evolutionary tracks with improved input physics ( yi et al .",
    "1997 ) produce qualitatively the same results .",
    "lee ( 1991 ) noted that the solid line in the m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h]@xmath52 diagram of fig .",
    "6a does not pass through a few stars at [ fe / h]@xmath52 @xmath59 -1.4 , and he suspected this deviation is perhaps due either to the observational errors or to the zero point uncertainty of the metallicity scale .",
    "alternatively , he suggested that a better match is obtained by the older model locus of 15.0 gyr ( i.e. , short - dashed line of fig .",
    "6 ) . in our new diagram of fig .",
    "6b , we can see that these deviant stars are now moved to [ fe / h]@xmath5 @xmath59 -1.5 and are , therefore , more well matched to the model locus .",
    "with our new data , the best match with the models is expected somewhere between the solid and dashed lines ( i.e. , @xmath48 14.3 gyr ) .",
    "note that the absolute ages in these models are based on the assumption that the mean age of the inner halo clusters is @xmath48 14.5 gyr , thus this result suggests @xmath0 cen is comparable in age with other inner halo clusters .",
    "if we remove stars in the range -1.9 @xmath9 [ fe / h]@xmath5 @xmath9 -1.5 , where most of the variables are believed to be extremely evolved stars ( see section 5.4 below ) , then we obtain @xmath3m@xmath7(rr)/@xmath3[fe / h ] = 0.24 @xmath62 0.04 , which is consistent , to within the errors , with the slopes obtained by ldz and lee ( 1990 ) from the evolutionary models , excluding the clusters in this metallicity range .",
    "consequently , rr lyrae stars in @xmath0 cen and their nonlinear m@xmath7(rr ) - [ fe / h ] relations from our observations provide a strong support for the ldz and lee ( 1990 ) evolutionary models .",
    "this non - linearity , which also implies that the relation between period - shift and metallicity is not linear ( see section 5.3 below ) , would clarify some of the disagreements with other investigators because fits of straight lines to different data sets produce significantly different slopes .",

    "the color information , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , of the @xmath0 cen variables was taken from sandage ( 1981 ) .",
    "7a shows that the relationship between metallicity and bolometric magnitude is not clear when the metallicities determined by previous @xmath3s observations are used ( dickens 1989 ) .",
    "not all the faintest stars are the most metal - rich stars , and some metal - rich stars are apparently as bright as the metal - poor stars . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in fig 7b , the metallicity dependence of rr lyrae magnitude becomes more distinct when we use our new [ fe / h]@xmath5 metallicities .",
    "now , most metal - rich rr lyrae stars lie below ( i.e. , having fainter magnitude ) the rr lyrae stars that are relatively more metal - poor .",

    "6b ) .",
    "if the relationship between m@xmath7(rr ) and [ fe / h]@xmath5 is not linear as noticed above , we expect a similar correlation between period - shift and [ fe / h ] for @xmath0 cen rr lyrae stars . in order to confirm this",

    "it should be noted that the period - shift values for metal - rich stars show similar or even larger shifts , compared to metal - poor stars .",

    "in particular , the evolutionary models of lee ( 1990 ) suggest that the rr lyrae stars in very blue hb clusters within the range -2.0@xmath9[fe / h]@xmath9 - 1.6 are highly evolved stars from the bluest hbs , and have significantly brighter magnitudes and longer periods than those near the zahb ( see also figs . 6 and 8) .",
