    "semiconductor double - quantum - well systems in a quantizing magnetic field develop spontaneous inter - layer coherence when the wells are brought into close proximity.@xcite spontaneous coherence leads to a variety of fascinating transport effects including counterflow superfluidity and anomalous interlayer tunneling , and to unusual charged excitations such as merons . a convenient way to describe these ground states is to use a pseudospin language in which the _ which layer _ degree - of - freedom is mapped to a @xmath8 pseudospin . in this language ,",
    "the ground state of a bilayer at total filling factor @xmath9 is an easy - plane pseudospin ferromagnet . at higher filling factors ,",
    "still more exotic states occur , for example states in which the pseudospin orientation varies in space and a charge - density - wave is formed.@xcite    interest has recently been growing in the strong - magnetic - field ordered states of graphene bilayers .",
    "single layer graphene@xcite is a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice network of carbon atoms .",
    "bilayer graphene@xcite consists of two graphene layers separated by a fraction of a nanometer . in the normal bernal stacking structure ,",
    "one of the two honeycomb sublattice sites in each layer has a near - neighbor in the other layer , and one does not .",
    "this arrangement producesbilayerexpt , mccann a set of landau levels with energies @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective cyclotron frequency and @xmath12 .",
    "all landau levels except @xmath2 are four - fold degenerate ; electronic states are specified by @xmath13 , valley - index ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) and spin - index , in addition to the usual label used to specify guiding center states within a landau level .",
    "the @xmath2 landau level has an additional two - valued quantum degree - of - freedom because states with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 landau - level character have zero kinetic energy .",
    "most of the new physics discussed in this paper is related to the property@xcite that electric dipoles can be constructed by forming wavefunctions with coherence between @xmath0 and @xmath1 components .",
    "a second peculiarity of the @xmath2 state is that wavefunctions associated with the @xmath3 valley are localized in one layer , while wavefunctions associated with the @xmath4 valley are localized in the opposite layer .",
    "layer and valley indices are thus equivalent .",
    "it is convenient to use pseudospins to represent both layer ( or equivalently valley ) and the landau - level orbital character degrees of freedom .",
    "the wavefunction for an electron in the @xmath2 landau level is therefore the direct product of a standard guiding center factor and three spinors that capture its dependence on spin , layer , and orbital - landau - index ( @xmath14 ) character .",
    "we refer to the final spinor as the orbital spinor , and to the set of eight landau levels with zero kinetic energy as the bilayer graphene octet.@xcite in neutral graphene the octet is half - filled at all magnetic field strengths .",
    "the presence of the octet in bilayers is revealed experimentally by a jump in the quantized hall conductivity @xcite from @xmath15 to @xmath16 when the charge density is tuned across neutrality in moderately disordered samples . in a recent paper@xcite",
    "some of us predicted that quantum hall effects would appear at all integer filling factors between @xmath17 and @xmath18 in samples of quality sufficientnomuraprl to make interactions dominant relative to unintended disorder .",
    "electron - electron interactions acting alone are expected to lift the degeneracy of the bilayer octet and induce gaps at the fermi level by producing a set of spontaneously broken symmetry states with spin , valley and orbital pseudospin polarizations .",
    "the octet degeneracy lifting is expected@xcite to follow a set of hund s rules in which spin polarization is maximized first , then layer polarization to the greatest extent possible , and finally orbital polarization to the extent allowed by the first two rules .",
    "hall plateaus at all integer filling factors intermediate between @xmath17 and @xmath18 have indeed now been discovered in experimental studies of suspended bilayer graphene samples and bilayer graphene on sio@xmath19/si substrates,@xcite opening up the opportunity to study a rich and still relatively unexplored@xcite family of novel broken symmetry states .",
    "the odd filling factor cases are expected to be most interesting because all three pseudospins are expected to be polarized .",
    "the present paper focuses on the physics associated with the competition between layer and orbital pseudospins at landau levels @xmath7 and @xmath20 at field strengths sufficient to produce maximal spin polarization and reduce the importance of landau - level mixing . in this limit",
    "a negative filling factor @xmath6 is equivalent to a positive filling factor @xmath21 since the two states differ only through the presence in the latter case of inert filled majority spin landau levels .    in a previous paper@xcite we studied the quantum hall states which occur at @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the same strong field regime , emphasizing the key role played by the potential energy difference between graphene layers which we refer to here as the bias potential @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 ground state at zero bias is an inter - layer coherent state with orbital index @xmath0 that supports counterflow superfluidity .",
    "one particularly interesting property of this state is that the superfluid density , the coefficient that relates the counterflow supercurrent to the spatial gradient of interlayer phase , vanishes . correspondingly , the state s goldstone mode dispersion is quadratic in wavector @xmath26 , in contrast to the linear dispersion found in coherent semiconductor bilayers and in standard superfluids .",
    "we also found that the uniform ground state has a long - wavelength instability at any non - zero potential - difference bias @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the critical bias at which all @xmath2 charge is tranferred to a single layer . in ref .",
    ", we argued that the instability is probably towards a state in which the direction of the inter - layer pseudospin varies in space . for larger bias @xmath29",
    "the ground state is uninteresting ; the charge is completely in one layer ( or valley ) and in the orbital state @xmath30 the orbital pseudospinwave mode corresponding to transitions between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbital states is gapped at a frequency @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the inter - layer tunneling energy in the bernal stacking .",
    "this mode , _ which is an intra - landau level excitation _",
    ", has a finite oscillator strength and will absorbbilayercr electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the standard kohn s theorem@xcite behavior in normal 2deg s which implies that only inter - landau level excitations produce absorption .",
    "surprisingly the phase diagrams for @xmath7 and @xmath33 states differ qualitatively from the corresponding @xmath34 and @xmath23 phase diagrams .",
    "the source of the difference is a competition in the @xmath35 case between interaction and single - particle effects which are reinforcing in the @xmath34 case .",
    "the end result is that the large @xmath24 ground state at @xmath35 places electrons in a coherent combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbital states , and that electric dipoles are consequently spontaneously present in the ground state .",
    "this paper analyzes the dependence of bilayer properties on @xmath24 and explores some of the consequences of the unusual orbitally ordered dipole state .    at small bias",
    "we find that the bilayer s @xmath35 ground state is an inter - layer coherent state , much like the corresponding @xmath34 state except that the coherence is between orbitals with @xmath1 character .",
    "this state has a gapless pseudospin wave mode with linear dispersion , like coherent semiconductor bilayers .",
    "the state also has a gapped orbital pseudospin collective mode .",
    "because the orbital spinor carries an electric dipole , this mode has a finite oscillator strength and absorbs electromagnetic radiation , again much like the @xmath34 case .",
    "this mode should be visible in a microwave spectoscopy experiment .",
    "inter - layer coherence decreases with bias until a new ground state is reached that has both inter - layer and orbital coherences . in this mixed state",
    ", the low - energy orbital and inter - layer pseudospin modes are both gapped .",
    "because the modes are coupled , both show up in the microwave absorption spectra .",
    "the collective excitations are highly anisotropic in this phase and we find that the intensity of the absorption depends strongly on the orientation of the electric field of the incident microwaves .    the new physics of the @xmath7 case emerges in its simplest form at still stronger bias potentials . both orbital levels in the bottom layer",
    "are then completely filled while only one of the two top layer landau levels is filled .",
    "spontaneous orbital coherence then develops in the top layer .",
    "this spontaneous orbital coherence leads to a _",
    "orbital pseudospin mode .",
    "some of the properties of this state have been studied independently in a recent paper by shizuya@xcite , who also pointed out that orbital coherence is responsible for the existence of a finite density of electrical dipoles with a net polarization .",
    "these dipoles collectively and spontaneously point in some arbitrary direction in the @xmath36 plane . as discussed by shizuya@xcite their orientation can however be controlled by an external electric field parallel to the plane of the bilayer . in this paper , we use an effective pseudospin model to highlight other interesting features of the orbitally - coherent state .",
    "in particular we demonstrate the presence of a dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite between orbital pseudospins and show that it leads to an anisotropic softening of the orbital pseudospin mode at a finite wavevector . for strong enough inter - layer bias",
    ", the dm induces an instability toward a pseudospin spiral state .",
    "the orbital pseudospin mode in the high bias regime is gapless and will lead , in the presence of disorder , to strong absorption of electromagnetic waves at very small frequencies .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the non - interacting states of the graphene bilayer within a two - band low - energy model . here",
    "we introduce the aspect of the electronic structure that is responsible for interaction and band effects which are competing at @xmath7 and are reinforcing at @xmath22 . in section iii",
    ", we derive the hamiltonian of the graphene two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) truncated to @xmath2 levels in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we use this hamiltonian to derive the equation of motion for the single - particle green s function in section iv and to obtain the order parameters for the various phases which occur at @xmath37 .",
    "section v  describes the generalized random - phase approximation ( grpa )  ( or equivalently the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhfa ) ) that we use to derive the collective excitations .",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath7 as a function of bias is obtained in section vi .",
    "we then study the collective excitations of the inter - layer coherent phase in section viiand those of the orbital coherent phase in section viii .",
    "finally microwave absorption in the different phases is studied in section ix and we conclude with a brief summary and some suggestions for future work in section x.",
