    "the simple feedback loses its efficiency when @xmath30 . in this range ,",
    "the electron beam oscillate too fast and the frequency of the oscillation does not match that of the lowest instability mode .",

    ", the effect can also be modelled as a wake field .",

    "we fix the low frequency limit to 50 mhz , which is below the first peak in the bottom figure of fig .",

    "[ fig : kink - feedback2-des ] , the required @xmath32 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we demonstrated that the kink instability will be suppressed by a pickup and kicker system with whole electron beam disruption parameter range ( 5150 ) , if the required frequency bandwidth is selected .",
