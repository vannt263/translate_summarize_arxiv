    "reverberation mapping uses observations of continuum and emission - line variability to probe the structure of the broad line region ( blr ) in active galactic nuclei ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) .",
    "it has been extensively used to estimate the physical size of the blr and the mass of central black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the observed continuum variability precedes the observed emission - line variability by a time related to the light travel time across the blr ; by obtaining an estimate of the time delay , or `` lag '' @xmath9 , between the change in continuum flux and the change in emission - line flux , one can estimate the size of the blr .",
    "while this is an extremely effective method , high - quality datasets are difficult to obtain , as they require well - spaced observations over long timescales .",
    "to date , over three dozen agn have estimated black hole masses obtained using reverberation methods .",
    "in addition to being important physical parameters , the blr radius and central black hole mass ( @xmath7 ) measurements are crucial in calibrating relationships between different properties of agn .",
    "a useful relationship that has emerged is the correlation between the radius of the blr ( @xmath5 ) and the optical luminosity of the agn ( e.g. kaspi et al .  2000 , 2005 ;",
    "bentz et al .  2006 ) .",
    "another key relationship is that between @xmath7 and bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath8 ) which is seen in both quiescent ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .  2000a",
    "; tremaine et al .  2002 ) and active galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferraresse et al .",
    "2001 ; nelson et al .  2004 ; onken et al .  2004",
    "; dasyra et al .",
    "these two relationships are critical because they allow us to estimate the masses of black holes in agn from a single spectrum ( see mcgill et al .",
    "2008 for a recent summary )  we estimate @xmath5 from the agn luminosity , the velocity dispersion of the blr is determined by the emission - line width , and the quiescient @xmath7@xmath10 relationship provides the calibration of the reverberation - based mass scale .",
    "obtaining high - quality single - epoch spectra is much less observationally demanding than obtaining high - quality reverberation measurements ; once relations such as these are properly calibrated , we can measure @xmath11 in many more objects than would otherwise be possible .",
    "an extensive set of objects with reliable black hole masses allows us to explore the connection between black holes and agn evolution over cosmologically interesting timescales .",
    "pg2130 + 099 has been a source of curiosity because it is an outlier in both the @xmath7@xmath10 and @xmath5@xmath6 relations .",
    "previous measurements obtained by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and reanalyzed by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found h@xmath0 lags of about 180 days .",
    "these measurements yield a black hole mass @xmath7 upwards of @xmath12 @xmath13 . at luminosity",
    "@xmath14(5100)=(@xmath15)@xmath16 erg s@xmath17 , this places pg2130 + 099 well above the @xmath5@xmath6 relationship ( bentz et al .",
    "dasyra et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also note that pg2130 + 099 falls above the @xmath7@xmath10 relationship . together",
    "these suggest that this discrepancy could be caused by measurement errors in the blr radius .",
    "our suspicions are also fueled by two other factors .",
    "first , the optical spectrum of pg2130 + 099 is similar to that of narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies , which are widely supposed to be agn with high accretion rates relative to the eddington rate ( see komossa 2008 for a recent review ) .",
    "however , the accretion rate derived from this mass and luminosity ( under common assumptions for all reverberation - mapped agn as described by collin et al .",
    "2006 ) is quite low compared to nls1s , again suggesting that @xmath7 and therefore @xmath9 are overestimated .",
    "second , as we discuss further below , a lag of approximately half a year on an equatorial source means that fine - scale structure in the two light curves will not match up in detail , and cross - correlation becomes very sensitive to long - term secular variations that may or may not be an actual reverberation signal .    for these reasons , we decided to undertake a new reverberation campaign to remeasure the h@xmath0 lag for pg2130 + 099 . in this paper , we present a new lag determination from this campaign . we also present a re - analysis of the earlier dataset that suggests that the true lag is consistent with our new lag value and investigate possible sources of error in the previous analysis .",
    "the data were obtained as a part of queue - scheduled program during the sdss - ii supernova survey follow - up campaign ( frieman et al .",
    "we obtained spectra of pg2130 + 099 with the boller and chivens ccd spectrograph on the mdm 2.4 m telescope for 21 different nights from 2007 september through 2007 december .",
    "we used a 150 grooves / mm grating which yields a dispersion of 3.29   pixel@xmath17 and covers the spectral range @xmath18@xmath19  .",
    "the slit width was set to @xmath20 projected on the sky and the spectral resolution was 15.2 .",
    "we used an extraction aperture that corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "the reduced spectra were flux - calibrated using the flux of the [ oiii]@xmath22 emission line in a reference spectrum created using a selection of 9 nights with the best observing conditions . using a @xmath23 goodness - of - fit estimator method ( van groningen & wanders 1992 ) , each individual spectrum was scaled to the reference spectrum . for three epochs ,",
    "no reasonable fit could be obtained , hence we scaled these spectra by hand to match the [ oiii]@xmath22 flux of the reference spectrum , which was 1.36@xmath2410@xmath25 erg s@xmath17 @xmath26 in the observed frame ( @xmath27  =  0.06298 ) .",
    "we then removed the narrow - line components of the h@xmath0 and [ oiii]@xmath28 , @xmath29 lines using relative line strengths given by peterson et al .",
    "figure [ fig : f1 ] shows the mean and rms spectra of pg2130 + 099 , created from the entire set of 21 flux - calibrated observations .    to measure the continuum and line fluxes ,",
    "we fit a line to the continuum between the regions @xmath30@xmath31   and @xmath32@xmath33  in the observed frame .",
    "we measured the h@xmath0 flux by integrating the flux above the continuum from @xmath31@xmath34 , and the optical continuum flux was taken to be the average flux in the range @xmath32@xmath33 .",
    "errors were estimated based on differences between observations that were close together in time . the observations from 2007",
    "september 27 ( jd2454371 ) had an extremely low signal - to - noise ratio @xmath35 compared to the rest of the population ; following peterson et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , we assigned fractional errors of 1/@xmath35 for this night in both the continuum and line flux . the resulting continuum and h@xmath0 light curves",
    "are given in table [ table : tbl1 ] and are shown in figure [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the properties of the final light curves used in our time series analysis are given in table [ table : tbl2 ] .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the spectral feature and column ( 2 ) gives the number of points in the individual light curves .",
    "columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) give the average and median time spacing between observations , respectively .",
    "column ( 5 ) gives the mean flux of the feature in the observed frame , and column ( 6 ) gives the mean fractional error that is computed based on observations that are closely spaced .",
    "column ( 7 ) gives the excess variance , defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the flux variance of the observations , @xmath38 is the mean square uncertainty , and @xmath39 is the mean observed flux .",
    "column ( 8) is the ratio of the maximum to minimum flux in each light curve .",
    "we note in passing that we attempted to determine light curves for the other prominent emission lines in our spectra , h@xmath40 and h@xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately , the fidelity of our flux calibration decreases away from the [ oiii]@xmath22 line ( which we believe accounts for the increasing strength of the rms spectrum longward of @xmath42  in figure [ fig : f1 ] ) and , combined with the low amplitude of variability , renders the other light curves unreliable",
    ". nevertheless , time series analysis yields results that are at least consistent with the h@xmath0 results , though with much larger uncertainties .",
    "to measure the lag between the optical continuum and h@xmath0 emission - line variations , we cross - correlated the h@xmath0 light curve with the continuum light curve using the interpolation method originally described by gaskell & sparke ( 1986 ) and gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) and subsequently modified by white & peterson ( 1994 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 1998b , 2004 ) .",
    "the method works as follows : because the data are not evenly spaced in time , we interpolate between points to obtain an evenly - sampled light curve .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient @xmath43 is then calculated using pairs of points , one from each light curve , separated by a given time lag .",
    "when @xmath43 is calculated for a range of time lag values , the cross correlation function ( ccf ) is obtained , which consists of the value of @xmath43 for each time lag value .",
    "we interpolated between the points on a 0.5 day timescale to obtain the ccf for our dataset , which is shown in figure [ fig : f3 ] .    to determine the most probable delay and its uncertainty , we employed the flux randomization / random subset sampling monte carlo method described by peterson et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "the `` random subset sampling '' method takes a light curve of @xmath44 points and samples it @xmath44 times without regard to whether or not any given point has been selected already .",
    "the flux uncertainty of a data point selected @xmath45 times is correspondingly reduced by a factor @xmath46 ( welsh 1999 ; peterson et al .",
    "the flux value of each point is then altered by a random gaussian deviate based on the uncertainty assigned to the point ; this is known as `` flux randomization '' .",
    "a ccf was calculated for each altered light curve using interpolation as before .",
    "using 2000 iterations of this process , we obtain a distribution of @xmath47 , measured from the ccf of each monte carlo realization and defined by the location of the peak value of @xmath43 .",
    "we also calculate and obtain a distribution of the lag values @xmath48 that represents the centroid of each ccf using the points surrounding the peak , based on all lag values with @xmath49 .",
    "we then adopt the mean values of both the centroid and peak @xmath50 and @xmath51 for our analysis .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties in @xmath48 and @xmath47 such that 15.87% of the realizations fall below the mean minus the lower error and 15.87% of the realizations fall above the mean plus the upper error .",
    "our final lag values and errors are @xmath52 days and @xmath53 days in the rest frame of pg2130 + 099 .",
    "it is important to note that the ccf is heavily dependent on the timespan of the light curve relative to the actual delay , and if the data timespan is short with respect to the lag , the ccf will be biased towards short lag measurements ( welsh 1999 ) .",
    "we note that because our data span just over three months , our ccf is not capable of producing a lag measurement as large as previous measurements and is subject to this bias .",
    "however , if the actual lag is shorter as the evidence presented in this work suggests , our data span a sufficiently long period to identify the true delay .    as a check on our time series analysis",
    ", we also employed an alternative method known as the @xmath27-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) , as described by alexander ( 1997 ) .",
    "this method is a modification of the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) described by edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "the dcf is obtained by correlating data points from the continuum with points from the h@xmath0 light curve by binning the data in time rather than interpolating between points .",
    "the zdcf similarly uses bins rather than interpolation , but bins the data by equal population rather than by equal spacing in time and applies fisher s @xmath27-transform to the cross correlation coefficients .",
    "discrete correlation functions have the advantage that they only use real data points , and are therefore less likely to find spurious correlations in data where there are large time gaps .",
    "however , datasets with few points tend to yield lag values with large uncertainties ; hence this method is primarily useful as a check on the interpolation method when the data are undersampled .",
    "figure [ fig : f3 ] shows the computed zdcf for our pg2130 + 099 dataset .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath27-transform requires a minimum of 11 points per bin to be statistically significant ( alexander 1997 ) ; because our light curves contained only 21 points , we were unable to obtain a well - sampled zdcf with a minimum of 11 points per bin .",
    "we used a minimum of 8 points per bin and do not obtain an independent lag measurement , but the zdcf is very consistent with our calculated ccf , indicating that the interpolation results are credible .",
    "we use the second moment of the line profile , @xmath54 ( fromerth & melia 2000 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) to characterize the width of the h@xmath0 line . to determine the best value of @xmath54 and its uncertainties , we use monte carlo simulations similar to those used in determining the time lag ( see peterson et al .",
    "we measure the line widths from both the mean and rms spectra created in the simulations from @xmath44 randomly chosen spectra and correct them for the spectrograph resolution .",
    "we obtain a distribution of each line width from multiple realizations , from which we take the mean value for our measure of @xmath54 or fwhm and the standard deviation as the measurement uncertainty .",
    "the measured line widths and uncertainties are given in table [ table : tbl3 ] .",
    "assuming that the motion of the h@xmath0-emitting gas is dominated by gravity , the relation between @xmath7 , line width , and time delay is @xmath55 where @xmath9 is the emission - line time delay , @xmath56 is the emission - line width , and @xmath57 is a dimensionless factor that is characterized by the geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "onken et al .  (",
    "2004 ) calculated an average value of @xmath39 by assuming that agn follow the same @xmath7@xmath8 relationship as quiescent galaxies . by normalizing the reverberation",
    "black hole masses to the relation for quiescent galaxies , they obtain @xmath58 when the line width is characterized by the line dispersion @xmath54 of the rms spectrum . and the fwhm in calculating @xmath7 are discussed by collin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . ]",
    "using our values of @xmath48 and @xmath54 , we compute @xmath2 ( @xmath3)@xmath4 .",
    "we also compute the average 5100  luminosity of our sample to see where our new @xmath5 value places pg2130 + 099 on the @xmath5@xmath6 relationship . following bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we correct our luminosity for host - galaxy contamination . assuming @xmath59 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we calculate @xmath62(5100)= 44.40@xmath63 for our recent measurements of pg2130 + 099 .",
    "the relevant measurements and computed quantities are given in table [ table : tbl4 ] .",
    "analysis of previous datasets of pg2130 + 099 yields lags greater than 150 days and @xmath7 values above @xmath12 @xmath13 , in both cases approximately an order of magnitude larger than our new value . to investigate the source of these discrepancies",
    ", we closely scrutinized the previous dataset , which consists of data obtained at steward observatory and wise observatory ( kaspi et al .",
    "the 5100  continuum and emission - line light curves , along with their respective ccf and zdcfs , are shown in figure [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "we first ran the full light curve through the time series analysis as described in section 2.3 to confirm the previous results , and successfully reproduced a lag measurement of @xmath64 days , in agreement with kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and peterson et al .",
    "however , visual inspection of the light curves suggests that these values were in error ; we were able to identify several features that are present in the continuum , h@xmath0 and h@xmath40 light curves that are quite visibly lagging on timescales shorter than 50 days , as we show below .",
    "it is clear that the kaspi et al .",
    "results are dominated by the data spanning the years 1993 - 1995 , as this period contains the most significant variability as well as time sampling that is sufficient to resolve features in the light curves .",
    "we show the light curves for all spectral features measured by kaspi et al .  during this time period in figure [ fig : f5 ] . over this period",
    ", we can match behavior in the continuum with the behavior of the emission lines , most noticeably in the data from 1995 .",
    "the most prominent features in the light curves are the maximum in the continuum at the end of the 1994 series and the maxima in the lines at the beginning of the 1995 series , which , based on the continuum variations , one would expect to be lower relative to the fluxes in 1994 .",
    "however , inspection of the relative flux levels of the lines and continuum in the 1994 and 1995 data reveals that the equivalent width of the emission lines changes during this timespan , which results in a rise in emission - line flux apparently unrelated to reverberation .",
    "the maximum in the continuum and those in the emission lines do not correspond to the same features the maxima in the emission line light curves in 1995 correspond to the similar feature in the continuum at the beginning of 1995 . because there are no observations during the six months or so between these features , the ccf and zdcf lock onto the two unrelated maxima that are separated by 196 days and yield lags of @xmath65200 days over this three - year span .",
    "the emission lines likely continued to increase in flux during the time period for which there were no observations .",
    "inspection of the light curve segments in figure [ fig : f5 ] reveals similar structures in each of them within a given year . to quantify the time delays between the continuum and lines on short timescales , we cross - correlated each individual year , this time using only flux randomization in the monte carlo realizations ,",
    "as there were too few points in each year to use random subset sampling , so the uncertainties are underestimated .",
    "the resulting lags are given in table [ table : lags ] .",
    "again we must consider that the ccf can not produce a lag that is greater than the duration of observations , so the individual ccfs for these three years are limited to short delays . however , the presence of the 1995 feature in both the continuum and emission - line light curves is unmistakable and it is extremely unlikely that it lags by a value exceeding the sensitivity limit of the ccf . from this",
    "we surmise that the discrepancies in measured lag values are mostly a result of large time gaps in the data and/or underestimation of the error bars in the kaspi et al .  data .",
    "welsh ( 1999 ) , and even earlier , prez , robinson , & de la fuente ( 1992 ) , pointed out that emission - line lags can be severely underestimated with light curves that are too short in duration , particularly if the blr is extended : certainly our 98-day campaign is insensitive to lags as long as @xmath66days .",
    "is it possible that the original lag determination of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is correct ( or more nearly so ) and we have been fooled by reliance on light curves that are too short ?",
    "we think not , based on ( 1 ) the reasonable match between details in the continuum and emission - line light curves for four different observing seasons ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , and 2007 ) , ( 2 ) the improved agreement with the @xmath5-@xmath6 relationship with the smaller lag ( demonstrated in figure [ fig : f6 ] ) , and ( 3 ) the improved agreement with the @xmath7-@xmath8 relationship with the smaller lag ( figure [ fig : f7 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out the difficulty of accurately measuring a @xmath67day lag , particularly in the case of equatorial sources which have a relatively short observing season .",
    "the short observing season , typically 6 - 7 months , means that there are very few emission - line observations that can be matched directly with continuum points : the observed emission - line fluxes represent a response to continuum variations that occurred when the agn was too close to the sun to observe .",
    "welsh ( 1999 ) has also pointed out the value in `` detrending '' the light curves removing long - term trends by fitting the light curves with a low - order function can reduce the bias toward underestimating lags . in this particular case , we find that detrending has almost no effect : in particular , the highest points in the continuum ( in late 1994 ) and the highest points in the line ( early in the 1995 observing season ) remain so after detrending , and both the interpolation ccf and zdcf weight these points heavily .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the peak in the zdcf agrees with the peak of the interpolation ccf ( figure [ fig : f4 ] ) , which demonstrates that the @xmath66day lag is _ not _ simply ascribable to interpolation across the gap between the 1994 and 1995 observing seasons .    the data from our 2007 campaign are not ideal : the amplitude of variability was low , the time sampling was adequate , but only barely , and the duration of the campaign was short enough that we lack sensitivity to lags of @xmath68days or longer .",
    "but the preponderance of evidence at this point argues that our smaller lag measurement is more likely to be correct than the previous determination .",
    "certainly better - sampled light curves of longer duration would yield a more definitive result .",
    "from a new reverberation campaign , we obtain a measurement of the time lag of the h@xmath0 line in pg2130 + 099 of @xmath48= 22.9@xmath1 days and calculate a central black hole mass @xmath2 ( @xmath3)@xmath4 . previous measurements of @xmath48 overestimated the size of the blr and therefore the mass of the black hole , most likely due to the undersampling in the light curves .",
    "a re - analysis of the previous data , using both visual and algorithmic methods , suggests that the true blr size and @xmath7 are consistent with our new values .",
    "the recent reverberation measurements for pg2130 + 099 presented in this study remove the discrepancies previously found for this object based on the @xmath7@xmath8 and @xmath5@xmath6 relationships .",
