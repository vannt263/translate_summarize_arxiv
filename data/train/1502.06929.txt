    "one of the often quoted motivations for supersymmetry ( susy ) is its ability to improve the possibility for gauge coupling unification at the grand unified ( gut ) scale , which is not possible in minimal su(5 ) @xcite .",
    "however , so(10 ) has the built - in possibility for achieving gauge coupling unification through several potential intermediate - scale gauge groups @xcite . of course , low - energy susy has many other motivations including the presence of a dark matter ( dm ) candidate @xcite whose stability is insured if @xmath8-parity is conserved .",
    "however , under very generic conditions , non - susy so(10 ) models also possess a remnant @xmath0 symmetry when an intermediate - scale u(1 ) symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "thus , several modest extensions of minimal so(10 ) may also allow for the possibility of dm .    in building a successful so(10 )",
    ", we must also require that the gut and intermediate mass scales be sufficiently large so as to ensure a proton lifetime and neutrino masses compatible with experiment .",
    "unfortunately , these requirements are not realized for every choice of intermediate - scale gauge group .",
    "the addition of a new so(10 ) multiplet containing a dm candidate will , however , affect the running of the gauge couplings and can improve the desired unification of the gauge couplings .",
    "for this reason , we suppose that the dm candidate be charged under the intermediate gauge symmetries .",
    "the cosmological production of dm could occur , for example , out of equilibrium from the thermal bath ( nonequilibrium thermal dm or netdm @xcite ) in a manner reminiscent of freeze - in scenarios @xcite .",
    "this mechanism works with a stable particle which has no interaction with the sm particles .",
    "thus , we focus on singlet dm candidates .",
    "further , as scalar dm would most assuredly couple to the standard model ( sm ) higgs , we limit our attention here to fermionic dm .",
    "so(10 ) grand unification is , of course , a general moniker for many candidate theories of unification , as there are several possible intermediate gauge groups and several possible choices for representations @xmath9 of higgs fields which break so(10 ) to the intermediate gauge group , @xmath10 , and then again , several possible choices of representations @xmath11 for the higgs fields which break @xmath10 down to the sm .",
    "furthermore , there are several possible choices for the representation which contains dm .",
    "thus , it may seem that dm in so(10 ) models is a rather robust and generic feature .",
    "however , if we insist on maintaining gauge coupling unification at a suitably high scale to guarantee proton stability , the number of models is dramatically reduced .",
    "in fact , by limiting the dimension of the representation containing dm to be no larger than a * 210 * , we find that only two models survive .    in this paper , we will systematically examine the possibility for fermionic netdm in so(10 ) models , though our conclusions are more general than the specific netdm model .",
    "we will discuss the various possible intermediate gauge groups and higgs representations which allow for gauge coupling unification , and we will demonstrate the effect of including two - loop running of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "the dm representation needs to be split so that only fermions with the appropriate gauge quantum numbers survive at low energy .",
    "this requires fine - tuning similar to the doublet - triplet separation problem in guts .",
    "we also systematically consider viable dm representation and their effect on the running of the gauge couplings . in all but two distinct models , the presence of dm spoils the desired unification of the gauge couplings .    in the following , we begin by discussing the origin of a discrete symmetry in a variety of models with different intermediate gauge groups and the possible representations for dm and the splitting of the dm multiplet . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gcu ] , we first demonstrate gauge coupling unification in these models ( without dm ) and show the effect of including the two - loop functions in the rge running and one - loop threshold effects .",

    "[ sec : models ] , we discuss the criteria which select only two possible models in a specific example of the netdm scenario @xcite",
    ". the phenomenological aspects of these models including neutrino masses , proton decay , and the production of dm through reheating after inflation will be discussed in sec .",

    "the higgs multiplets which break so(10 ) and @xmath10 are called @xmath9 and @xmath11 , respectively . in addition , we require that there be a remnant discrete symmetry @xmath17 that is capable of rendering a sm singlet field to be stable and hence account for the dm in the universe @xcite . the mechanism for ensuring a remnant @xmath17 is discussed in detail in sec .",
