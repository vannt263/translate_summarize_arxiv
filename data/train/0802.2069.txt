    "<S> using density functional theory ( dft ) , we analyze the influence of five classes of functional groups , as exemplified by no@xmath0 , och@xmath1 , ch@xmath1 , ccl@xmath1 , and i , on the transport properties of a 1,4benzenedithiolate ( bdt ) and 1,4benzenediamine ( bda ) molecular junction with gold electrodes . our analysis demonstrates how ideas from functional group chemistry may be used to engineer a molecule s transport properties , as was shown experimentally and using a semiempirical model for bda [ nano lett .  * 7 * , 502 ( 2007 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the qualitative change in conductance due to a given functional group can be predicted from its known electronic effect ( whether it is @xmath2/@xmath3 donating / withdrawing ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the influence of functional groups on a molecule s conductance is very weak , as was also found in the bda experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated dft conductances for the bda species are five times larger than the experimental values , but good agreement is obtained after correcting for selfinteraction and image charge effects .    </S>",
    "<S> .functional group categorization by electronic effect with further examples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     in table [ psic_exp ] we compare our dft calculated conductances for the bda species with corresponding experimental values  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated numbers are roughly five times larger than the experimental ones due to the above mentioned deficiencies of the dft approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , interesting to notice that : ( i ) the weak effect of functional groups is found in both data sets ( ii ) the qualitative effect of the functional groups on the conductance ( increase / decrease ) is reproduced by calculations . in the second column of table [ psic_exp ] </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of our conductance calculations after a ` scissors operator ' ( so ) , which corrects for selfinteraction errors and image charge effects , has been applied to the molecule s spectrum .    to construct the so we follow a recent work by quek _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  who applied the scheme to a bdagold junction  @xcite . in this method , </S>",
    "<S> the underestimation of the dft homo and lumo are corrected by shifting the occupied / unoccupied orbitals of the contacted molecule by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dft homo level for the _ free _ molecule and @xmath6 the ionization potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the later in dft from @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total energy of the molecule with charge @xmath9 in the gas phase , while @xmath10 is the total energy in the gas phase of the neutral molecule . for bda without functional groups we find @xmath11 6.73 ev , which agrees quantitatively with the experimental value of 6.83 ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found only small variations in @xmath12 for the different bda species and have used @xmath13 -2.7 ev for all molecules , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hybrid ] .    to estimate the shift of the molecular levels by image charge effects , </S>",
    "<S> we first calculate the charge distribution after removing an electron from the free molecule . </S>",
    "<S> a mulliken analysis is then used to approximate this continuous charge distribution by point charges located at the atoms of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we model the gold contacts as two perfectly conducting surfaces separated by 13.2  , which corresponds to the vacuum separation between the opposing gold ( 111 ) surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain an image potential @xmath14 -0.9 ev for all of the bda species considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the bda molecular junctions , we thus shift all occupied / unoccupied orbitals ( obtained by diagonalizing @xmath15 ) by @xmath161.8 ev as indicated in fig.[hybrid ] . calculating the conductance using the renormalized hamiltonian yields the values shown in table [ psic_exp ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this ` ad hoc ' correction produces results approximately half those obtained from breakjunction experiments on the bda species  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is most probably due to our choice of contact geometry , as our calculated conductance for bda of 0.024 @xmath17 is about half the average dft value calculated over 15 different breakjunction contact geometries of 0.046 @xmath17  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we stress , however , that the use of this so can only be justified for weakly coupled molecules with homo / lumo levels well separated from @xmath18 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hybrid ] we see this is the case for the bda species , since the homos are localized near the amine contact groups , providing a poor overlap with the gold contact orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the bdt species , whose homos are rather diffuse around the sulfur atoms , there is a strong overlap with the gold contact orbitals , so that application of the so is not justified .    in conclusion , we found that the ideas of functional group chemistry may be applied to qualitatively predict the influence of a functional group on the electronic structure of a parent molecule , as has been found for bda both experimentally and using a semiempirical model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also found that functional groups have a very weak influence on a molecule s conductance in agreement with recent experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the weak influence is that charge neutrality pins the homo / lumo molecular levels , making it difficult to shift them relative to @xmath18 . by applying multiple functional groups to the same parent molecule it may be possible to obtain a stronger influence , as was found for bda @xcite . by employing a scissors operator correcting for selfinteraction errors and image charge effects </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained qualitative agreement with experimental conductance values for the bda species . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that effective ` switching ' of a molecule s conductance may require a more direct change in the strength or geometry of the molecule s contacts , to overcome the ` level pinning ' of the metal .    </S>",
