    "it is well known that a charged particle moving in the vacuum can not emit or absorb photons due to the energy - momentum conservation laws . on the other hand , emission or absorption",
    "is possible when particle moves in a medium or close to an interface .",
    "cherenkov , transition , smith - purcell radiations are the examples of above mentioned emission ( see , for example , @xcite ) . during the recent years the inverse counterparts of the mentioned radiations have been observed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "earlier the inverse smith - purcell effect for periodical metallic gratings was theoretically analyzed in the sub - millimeter wavelength region @xcite .",
    "the interest to these effects is largely motivated by a possibility of laser driven acceleration of charged particles . besides , the inverse smith - purcell effect can be used in electron energy gain spectroscopy @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the inverse smith - purcell effect , namely the absorption of a photon by an electron which moves parallel to a rough surface . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no such calculations have been previously reported .",
    "the main difficulties with rough surfaces arise because it is more difficult to perform analytical calculations when we deal with an arbitrary shaped profile of the grading for understandable reasons : there is no general algorithm to calculate the radiating part in the reflected waves . at present , most numerical simulations are available as one of the effective tools to analyze and to observe a variety of physical quantities such as electromagnetic fields as functions of time and space , power outflow , radiated intensity as a function of the radiating angle , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore any study of the inverse smith - purcell radiation from rough surfaces should be quite important and analytical results are highly desirable .",
    "the purpose of the present work goes in this direction , in the sense that we provide analytical expression for the absorption probability of a photon by an electron moving parallel to a rough surface . in the diffusion regime",
    "we were able to obtain a closed analytic expression for the absorption probability , taking into account the diffusion contribution .",
    "we show that the diffusion contribution is dominant compared to the single scattering probability .",
    "it has been considered recently , by one of the authors ( gevorkian ) , the radiation from a charged particle moving parallel to rough surfaces @xcite . the averaged radiation intensity for a quite general surface",
    "random profile was directly calculated and it is shown that the main contribution to the radiation intensity is determined by the multiple scattering of polaritons induced by a charge on the surface .",
    "we will develop an approach , following closely refs.@xcite , which allows us to investigate periodical as well as random surface profiles , different materials from sub - millimeters to optics .",
    "we indicate necessary conditions for absorption to take place .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly formulate the problem and introduce the basic equation for the absorption probability of a single photon of energy @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iii we carry out an exhaustive description of our two - dimensional rough surface and the analytical approach used in absorption probability calculations . in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the absorption probabilities with single and multiple scattering contributions .",
    "it was shown that the diffusion contribution to absorption probability is the dominant one . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the utilization of the inverse smith - purcell effect for particle acceleration . finally , we summarize our results in sec . vi .",

    "a fast electron one can assume that the wave function @xmath8 remains unchanged during the interaction with the photon .",
    "we will discuss conditions of applicability of this assumption below . treating electron and photon as a quantum mechanical subjects ,",
    "the absorption probability of absorption of a single photon of energy @xmath0 can be represented in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 is the electric field component along the electron motion direction that includes incident as well as scattered from surface fields and @xmath17 are the electron constant coordinates in the perpendicular to motion plane . if the incident field is a plane wave then it is easy to convince oneself that the incident part does not contribute to the integral",
    ". therefore , for analytical evaluation of the integral , eq.([abs ] ) , the field @xmath18 will be substituted by the scattered one .",
    "this will be done in the next sections , separately for the situations when single and multiple scattering contributions are taken into account , while calculating the appropriate absorption probability .",
    "dielectric constant of the system is described as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the step function and @xmath21 is the dielectric constant of the isotropic medium , @xmath22 is the random profile of the surface . assuming that @xmath23 is small and expanding the @xmath24 in powers of @xmath23 and keeping linear terms wee get @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath27 at @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 describes the flat surface between vacuum and medium . under this assumption",

    "\\label{gr}\\ ] ] it is worth noticing that the presence of the @xmath37-function in the expression of @xmath38 will lead to the different values of any physical quantity at @xmath39 , while evaluating the integral over @xmath40 . to avoid the problem with discontinuous physical quantities at @xmath39 in our further calculations we will take their value at @xmath41 , see also , @xcite",
    ". such determination of integrals over @xmath37 functions give correct answers in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "hence , substituting eqs.([gr ] ) and ( [ sc ] ) into eqs.([abs ] ) , one has @xmath43 this is a general expression , independent of the model considered and can be applied for both , periodical and random grating cases .",
    "below , we will analyze these cases separately ( hereafter the sign @xmath44 is omitted ) . in the periodical grating case",
    "( photonic crystal ) surface profile is a periodical function @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a two - dimensional vector and @xmath47 are the grating periods in the @xmath2 and @xmath48 directions , respectively . in the rough surface case @xmath49",
    "is a gaussian distributed random function .",
    "first let us consider the photonic crystal case .",
    "it is convenient first to present green s function in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fourier transform in the @xmath3 plane . in the second step ,",
    "let us assume that the plane of incidence of external light is @xmath52 .",
    "then the background electric field in eq.([abs1 ] ) that includes incident and reflected parts , takes the form : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath20 is the angle between the external photon momentum and electron velocity directions . substituting expressions for green s function , electric field and @xmath49 into eq.([abs1 ] ) , one finds @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath6 is the system size in the @xmath2 direction and @xmath57 was substituted by @xmath58 . in the weak scattering regime",
    "@xmath59 the green s functions in eq.([abs3 ] ) can be substituted by the bare green s functions .",
    "the latter quantities are the solutions of eqs.([gr ] ) with @xmath60 and were found in @xcite .",
    "the existence of the @xmath37 function in eq.([abs3 ] ) sets the relation between the external light wavelength , incident angle , electron velocity and the gratings period .",
    "interestingly , they are related to each other in the same way as in the direct smith - purcell effect @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "note that the dispersion relation depends only on the grating period in the electron velocity direction . as it was is shown in @xcite @xmath63 which for our problem means that a photon polarized in the perpendicular to incidence plane ( s - polarization ) can not be absorbed by the electron . therefore we will consider the case when the incident photon is p - polarized . to simplify the problem consider the limit @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the main contribution to the eq.([abs3 ] ) comes from the term containing @xmath65 .",
    "the explicit expression of the bare green s function is ( see @xcite ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 if @xmath68 and @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 . substituting eq.([fugr2 ] ) into eq.([abs3 ] ) , one comes after some algebraic manipulations to the following expression for @xmath72    @xmath73}\\times \\\\ \\nonumber & \\times & \\frac{\\exp\\left(-4\\pi z\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d^2}+\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2\\beta^2\\lambda^2}}\\right)}{\\left[(\\varepsilon^*(\\omega)\\beta^2 - 1-\\frac{\\lambda^2\\beta^2}{d^2})^{1/2}-i\\varepsilon^*(\\omega)\\sqrt{\\gamma^{-2}+ \\frac{\\lambda^2\\beta^2}{d^2}}\\right ] } , \\label{complex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitude of electric field includes both incident and reflected parts , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the amplitude of incident field and @xmath77 is the reflection amplitude that goes to unity in the limit @xmath42 . because of the exponential function absorption takes place for the electron distances from the surface satisfying the condition @xmath78 for the distances eq.([dist ] ) electron transverse wave function @xmath8 remains unchanged during the interaction with the photon .",
    "we need this assumption for derivation of absorption probability eq.([abs ] ) .",
    "essential absorption probability is achieved in the case when the imaginary part of @xmath21 is small compared to the real part .",
    "such a situation occurs , for example , for noble metals _",
    "au , ag , cu and etc _ at the infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "as an example for gold at photon energy @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "assuming @xmath21 real , for the distances eq.([dist]),one obtains @xmath82}. \\label{abs4}\\ ] ] since the absorption probability is positive one gets a condition on the particle velocity @xmath83 maximum of @xmath72 is achieved provided that the equality in eq.([vel ] ) holds .",
    "it follows from eq.([vel ] ) that the wavelength @xmath84 is suppressed . taking the limit @xmath85 one returns , as it should be expected , to the smith - purcell geometry with periodicity only in the direction of particle motion . in this geometry and for metallic gratings",
    "@xmath86 the quantity @xmath87 represents the velocity of induced polariton on the surface .",
    "hence , the condition eq.([vel ] ) , means that the maximum of absorption is reached if the particle velocity equals the polariton velocity .",
    "the above consideration can be generalized to a case when a charged particle travels over a rough surface , by applying a recently developed approach to study the spectrum of radiation from a surface roughness @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in this case absorption probability consists of two parts , each of them has different origin and must be evaluated separately .",
    "one is caused by the single scattering of polaritons another is caused by their diffusion , i.e. , by the multiple scattering effect . using eq.([abs1 ] ) , for the single scattering contribution to the absorption probability , one obtains @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the correlation function of the rough surface profile .",
    "we assume that the surface profile fluctuations are uncorrelated .",
    "this allows us to substitute the correlation function @xmath90 by @xmath37 function except the cases when finite correlation length is needed for divergence reasons , i.e. to avoid the divergences in integral calculations .",
    "such an approximation is justified provided that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the correlation length of random surface profile fluctuations .",
    "next , we evaluate the integral eq.([single ] ) , by assuming @xmath93 .",
    "then , taking the fourier transforms , substituting eq.([fugr2 ] ) into eq.([single ] ) in the limit @xmath94 ( more precisely @xmath95 ) , we obtain the desired result for the absorption probability with single scattering contribution @xmath96 where @xmath97 . \\label{endep}\\ ] ] note that in eqs.([single1],[endep ] ) , like before , we assume that imaginary part of @xmath98 is small and neglect it compared to real part . for the positive @xmath98 ( dielectrics ) ,",
    "as it follows from @xmath99 , the expression under the square root is always positive . as for negative @xmath98 ( metals )",
    ", it can be easily checked , that it leads to serious restriction on the energy of particle , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "maximum absorption is achieved when the equality holds , i.e. , @xmath101 , see fig.2 .        for the negative @xmath98",
    "a plasmon - polariton is formed on the surface , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . the pole at @xmath102 in the green s function eq.([fugr2 ] ) is manifestation of the plasmon - polariton .",
    "it is scattered on the inhomogeneities and gives contribution to the scattered electric field in eq.([abs ] ) and hence to the absorption probability @xmath72 . the expression ( [ single1 ] ) is the plasmon - polariton single scattering contribution . to make a further analytical progress in the study of @xmath72 we will assume that the following inequality is met : @xmath103 , where @xmath104 are elastic and inelastic mean free paths of polariton on the surface .",
    "in other words we will assume that the condition of multiple or diffusional scattering of polariton are realized in the surface . in our calculations of the diffusional contribution to the absorption probability",
    "we follow closely refs . @xcite .",
    "further manipulations are completely analogous to those outlined in refs.@xcite for the case of the radiation problem .",
    "hence , here we present the final result without derivation by noting , that the diffusion contribution to absorption probability is the dominant one @xmath105 indeed , as seen from eq.([diff ] ) , the quantity @xmath106 is proportional to @xmath107 , with prefactor @xmath108 , which is the average number of polariton scatterings in the system . in the diffusion regime",
    "the ratio is large number , i.e @xmath109 , see also @xcite , justifying that the diffusion contribution is dominant .",
    "it is important to notice , that one of the advantages of the random surface profile is that the external light incident angle can be arbitrary instead the certain one in the periodical case .    for completeness",
    ", we also compare the absorption probability with the probability of emission of a photon by a charge particle moving under the same conditions , see fig.1 .",
    "the probability of emission of a photon of energy @xmath0 by an electron moving over a rough surface can be estimated as ( following refs.@xcite ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the distance from the plane @xmath39 . using eqs.([single1 ] ) , ( [ endep ] ) , ( [ diff ] ) and ( [ emiss ] ) the ratio of probabilities can be estimated as @xmath113 now let us estimate numerically @xmath114 . before doing so , first we verify numerically the applicability of the diffusion approximation .",
    "note , that in the weak scattering regime average mean free paths are described by the following expressions : @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xcite . for @xmath117 at the photon energy @xmath118 @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath119 .",
    "taking for the roughness parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 one gets @xmath122 and @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the conditions @xmath125 of diffusion of polaritons are realized in the system .",
    "now taking electron energy @xmath126 , @xmath127 , laser power @xmath128 one finds from eq.([ratio ] ) that @xmath129 .",
    "note that in contrary to the radiation case @xcite , where maximum is achieved for short wavelengths ( blue part of visible region ) , here maximum of probability takes place for infrared wavelengths .",
    "an interesting and difference feature of the absorption probability , compared to the radiation case is its strong dependence on the particle energy fig.2 .",
    "this dependence can be quantitatively measured and can be used for investigation of metal dielectric constant @xmath21 in the optical region .",
    "concluding this section let us note that the ratio @xmath114 can be made essentially larger via increasing the laser power .",
    "this point is topical for the laser driven acceleration application of the inverse smith - purcell effect .",
    "we now want to discuss utilization of the inverse smith - purcell effect for particle acceleration .",
    "metal surfaces with rough or one - dimensional periodic gratings can not be used for acceleration purposes because of the restriction on the energy of particle ( see eq.([vel ] ) .",
    "however , there is an important exception , when the strength of the electric field , that determines the absorption probability and were scattered from a metal surface , can be resonantly large . to illustrate this , we consider two - dimensional periodical grating case . the absorption probability , eq.([abs4 ] ) , is straightforwardly applicable in this case . rewriting the restriction condition on the energy , eq.([vel ] ) , in the form",
    "@xmath130 it is easy to see , that the most favorable situation happens when the photon energy satisfies the resonant condition , i.e. the denominator of eq.([resen ] ) becomes zero @xmath131 note that we have in mind optical frequencies for which @xmath21 is a large negative number . in this case",
    "the energy of accelerated particle can be very large .",
    "the absorption probability eq.([abs4 ] ) at the resonance photon energy will be large too .",
    "the largeness of absorption probability is caused by the resonance enhancement of the scattered field due to the surface plasmon - polaritons .",
    "growth of probability is limited only by the losses in the optical region . in dielectrics restriction on energy",
    "is absent and they can be used in acceleration purposes , see for example , ref.@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the absorption of a photon by an electron moving over a rough surface .",
    "optimal conditions that include polarization of incident light , electron energy , material and grating types are indicated .",
    "in particular , it is shown that only p - polarized photon can be absorbed . for metallic surfaces and for relativistic particles two - dimensional",
    "periodical grating is preferable because of the restriction on the energy of particle . for dielectrics restriction on the energy",
