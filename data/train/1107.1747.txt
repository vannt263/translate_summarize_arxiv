    "if the scattering interaction is sufficiently small compared to the transverse energy scale , one can neglect the effect of the nonlinear interaction on the atomic transverse degrees of freedom and hence approximate the condensate wave function by a product wave function , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ground - state wave function of the bare transverse potential and @xmath19 is the solution of the @xmath12-dimensional , longitudinal gp equation @xmath20 which is found by plugging the product ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) into the gp equation  ( [ timeindepgpe ] ) and projecting the result onto the subspace spanned by @xmath21 .",
    "here @xmath22 is the longitudinal part of the chemical potential , @xmath23 is the transverse ground - state energy , and @xmath24    in this reduced - dimension approximation , the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom are decoupled , which should hold as long as the number of atoms in the condensate is small compared to an ( upper ) critical atom number @xmath25 , defined as the number at which the scattering energy becomes comparable to the transverse kinetic energy , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a measure of the inverse volume occupied by the condensate wave function  @xmath2 .    as @xmath1 approaches @xmath25 , one can no longer neglect the effects of the scattering interaction on the condensate transverse degrees of freedom ; as a result , the product ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) is no longer a good approximation to the three - dimensional wave function .",
    "such effects are responsible not only for redefining the transverse and longitudinal wave functions , but also for entangling the spatial directions .",
    "we show below that these effects can be readily calculated in the perturbative regime where @xmath1 is small compared to @xmath25 by performing a perturbative schmidt decomposition of the condensate wave function .",
    "our goal is to find an approximate solution to eq .",

    "we can assume that the condensate wave function and the schmidt basis functions are real .    as the deviations from the reduced - dimension approximation arise in a regime where the scattering interaction can be considered as a perturbation to the single - particle transverse hamiltonian",

    "we begin by writing the gp equation in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the transverse ( longitudinal ) single - particle hamiltonian and @xmath35 is a formal perturbation parameter .",
    "notice that due to the asymmetry of the trapping potential , the longitudinal hamiltonian @xmath36 and the nonlinear scattering interaction are treated as of the same size , both being order @xmath35 smaller than the transverse hamiltonian .",
    "as @xmath35 goes to zero , we expect the solution of the gp equation  ( [ timeindepgpe ] ) to reduce to the product wave function  ( [ ansatz ] ) , in which the schmidt decomposition has only one term . as @xmath35 increases , the schmidt decomposition acquires additional terms .",
    "we are thus motivated to treat the schmidt decomposition formally as a power - series expansion in @xmath35 : @xmath37 in developing the perturbation theory , we find it convenient to absorb the schmidt coefficients into the transverse schmidt basis functions , which thus satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath38 the longitudinal schmidt basis functions are orthonormal , @xmath39 the consequences of the normalization of the overall wave function and of the orthogonality relations  ( [ chinchim ] ) and  ( [ phinphim ] ) are spelled out in appendix  [ ap : expansion ] .",
    "we also look for the chemical potential as an expansion in powers of @xmath35 , @xmath40 and similarly for the schmidt basis functions as @xmath41    we seek a solution to the 3d  gp equation  ( [ 3dgpe ] ) to first order in @xmath35 .",

    "the difference between the solid and dashed lines comes from the nonseparable corrections to the dominant schmidt term ; this contribution is quite small , confirming the conclusions drawn from the concurrence . ]",
    "the results of this subsection point to the interesting conclusion that the nonseparable corrections to the dominant schmidt term are small even for relatively large @xmath1 . therefore , as far as the ground - state properties go , one can nearly neglect the spatial entanglement and describe the condensate wave function in terms of the product wave function corresponding to the first schmidt term .",
    "we begin our concluding section by noting that there is another way to do the perturbation theory , which we call the relative - state method , in contrast to the schmidt - decomposition method developed in this paper .",
    "the relative - state method starts from a relative - state decomposition of the condensate wave function in the bare transverse eigenbasis @xmath168 : @xmath169 the dominant longitudinal wave function , @xmath170 , is determined by projecting the 3d  gp equation  ( [ timeindepgpe ] ) onto @xmath21 and thus satisfies the reduced - dimension gp equation  ( [ ddgpe ] ) ; it is not the same as @xmath76 of the schmidt theory , but rather is the same as @xmath47 .",
    "the relative - state longitudinal wave functions @xmath171 are neither orthogonal nor normalized .",
    "one can work out the relative - state perturbation theory order by order , and this is more straightforward than the same process in the schmidt - decomposition perturbation theory . at the order we are working ,",
    "we have shown explicitly that the two perturbation theories are equivalent .    even though the relative - state perturbation theory is easier to implement , especially at higher orders than we consider in this paper , it obscures the physics of the condensate wave function . in the schmidt perturbation theory",
    ", the @xmath44 term gives the best product approximation to the exact wave function , and the schmidt theory gets directly at how that term is modified by higher - order effects of the nonlinear scattering interaction .",
    "the @xmath172 terms in the schmidt theory describe entanglement of the transverse and longitudinal directions , and the schmidt approach neatly separates this entanglement from the dominant ( @xmath44 ) schmidt term .",
    "the relative - state theory can be used to calculate all these effects  and , as noted , it gives the same results at the order we are working  but it does not divide up the terms in perturbation theory in this neatly interpreted way .",
    "we close with two ideas , on both of which we have already commenced work .",
    "the comparisons of the schmidt perturbation theory with the exact numerical results , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] , suggest that the ground - state condensate wave function , for surprisingly high atom numbers , is well approximated by the two - schmidt - term perturbation theory and even by the dominant schmidt term alone .",
    "this prompts us to wonder what happens to the schmidt decomposition of the ground - state wave function as the atom number crosses over from reduced - dimension behavior for atom numbers below @xmath25 to the three - dimensional behavior above @xmath25 .",
    "we have evidence , to be presented elsewhere , that throughout the cross - over , the ground - state wave function continues to be well approximated by two schmidt terms , and this suggests that an approximate description based on just two schmidt terms might work through the entire cross - over and into the three - dimensional regime .    as we noted out above , the corrections to the reduced - dimension approximation are particularly important for interferometric schemes that use becs  @xcite . a remaining problem in that regard is to assess how such corrections propagate in time and affect the condensate dynamics in a highly anisotropic trap .",
