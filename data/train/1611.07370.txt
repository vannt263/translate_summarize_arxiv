    "the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter ruled by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) under extreme conditions of temperature and density is a profound and challenging area overlapping statistical , particle and nuclear physics . a deep understanding of its phase structure of qcd is expected to bring some insights on many fundamental problems such as compact stars , and the early universe  @xcite .",
    "experiments with heavy - ion collisions such as the bnl relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) are continuing active investigations on the strongly interacting matter in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that qcd could lead to a rich phase structure of matter  @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations from the first principle have revealed that the confined quarks will become released to quark - gluon plasma around the temperature @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the sign problem , monte carlo methods can be only directly applied to states around zero quark density .",
    "therefore , effective models which exhibit the features of color confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are more feasible to be used to study the phase structure of qcd on the density in addition to temperature . here",
    ", we will adopt the polyakov - loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model with chiral and axial chemical potentials  @xcite .    in the pnjl model with some assumptions",
    ", it is found that the chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement transition may coincide , i.e. discontinuities appear simultaneously in their order parameters , the chiral condensate @xmath9 and the polyakov loop @xmath10 , and they are of the first order  @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial critical end point ( cep ) also exists at finite temperature @xmath11 and a quark chemical potential @xmath12 , which indicates a coincidence of second - order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "although the axial currents are not conserved due the global topological solutions of qcd ( such as instantons etc . ) and quantum anomaly  @xcite , to characterize imbalance on the chirality in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) for the quark matter , we follow the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , similar to the chemical potential @xmath12 , introduce a chiral chemical potential @xmath1 ( conjugate to @xmath17 ) as a mathematical artifice to mimic the effects of ` chiral transitions ' .",
    "this also leads to a novel idea , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to detect the cep by simulating qcd but with the chiral chemical potential @xmath1 , then by continuation in the plane of @xmath1-@xmath12 , the critical end point cep denoted by @xmath18 can be obtained , which is accessible to lattice qcd simulations of grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "thus the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite believe that it should be a signal for the existence of the cep in qcd if a @xmath18 is found by lattice simulation .",
    "besides , since physical systems in the same universality class all share the same critical exponents , so here we would like to check if this continuation is reasonable by precise checking the impacts on the critical exponents brought by the introduction of @xmath1 .    for the two - flavor pnjl model ,",
    "there are unphysical decays of hadrons to quarks due to the spurious poles in the quark loop diagrams  @xcite .",
    "introducing a lower momentum cutoff to mimic confining effects of strong interaction helps to address this problem .",
    "this is also the starting point for us further to incorporate the finite - volume effects . in experiments of heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the strongly interacting matter formed through the energy deposition of the colliding particle definitely has a finite volume .",
    "therefore , it is very important to have a knowledge on the finite - volume effects when studying the thermodynamic phases experimentally . in the context of heavy - ion collisions , the importance of finite - volume effects in the thermodynamics of strong interaction matter",
    "may be brought forward with the help of finite size scaling analysis  @xcite . in the past years",
    ", many theoretical studies of finite - volume effects have been performed on njl models  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently the studies on the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter in a finite volume using the pnjl models have aroused increasing attention  @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : pnjl ] we briefly review the pnjl model with chemical and chiral chemical potentials in the mean field approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phases ] , numerical results on chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement transition for @xmath0 model with the infinite size are presented .",
    "we also verify that the chiral chemical potential does not impact on the value of critical exponents . by introducing the lower momentum cutoff",
    ", we investigate its finite - volume effects in sec .",
    "[ sec : volume ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and some conclusions are made .",
    "in this section , firstly we briefly review the pnjl model and its extension in the mean field approximation  @xcite .",

    "the potential term @xmath25 is the effective potential expressed in terms of the traced polyakov loop @xmath10 and its conjugate @xmath26 the polyakov loop @xmath27 is a matrix in color space explicitly given by @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the inverse temperature and @xmath30 . in the polyakov gauge ,",
    "@xmath27 can have a diagonal representation in color space  @xcite .",
    "the traced polyakov loop @xmath10 is an exact order parameter of spontaneous @xmath31 symmetry breaking in pure gauge theory .",
    "although in full qcd the presence of dynamical quarks explicitly breaks the @xmath31 symmetry , it still seems to be a good indicator of the deconfinement phase transition . to incorporate the confinement or deconfinement properties , we have introduced a polyakov - loop - dependent coupling constant @xmath32 as @xmath33.\\ ] ] for simplicity we will take @xmath34 following refs .",
    "@xcite , which implies @xmath35 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effects of fluctuations leading to @xmath36 turn out not to be of major qualitative importance in determining the phase diagram .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be obtained by a best fit of lattice data at zero and imaginary chemical potential , which leads to @xmath39 .",
    "now let us consider the extended pnjl model , since we would like to treat quark matter with chirality imbalance @xmath40 .",
    "the way to do it is , besides the chemical potential @xmath12 conjugated to the density @xmath41 , additionally to introduce a chiral chemical potential @xmath1 conjugated to the chiral density @xmath42  @xcite . at lagrangian level , this amounts to add the density operator @xmath43 and the chiral density operator @xmath44 to eq .  .",
    "namely the lagrangian   for the model has been extended to the following @xmath45     -\\mathcal{u}(l , l^{\\dag},t ) .",

    "the momentum integral for @xmath53 corresponds to the vacuum quark fluctuations and a momentum cutoff @xmath54 is introduced to regularize it here .",

    "in this section we will present the way to find chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement transition in the pnjl model with chemical potential @xmath12 and chiral chemical potential @xmath1 , and show its reasonableness for investigating the qcd phase transitions .    for",
    "any given @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 , we can obtain the corresponding values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 by solving the gap equations @xmath61    however , this approach is hard to work in practice due to the difficulty in solving the coupled integral equations by means of iterative methods .",
    "moreover , the solutions of these equations do not necessarily yield a global minimum .",
    "there are possibilities that they may yield a local minimum , even a maximum .",
    "therefore here not only to find the solutions of eq .",
    "we also need to check that the corresponding solution yields a global minimum when they are inserted back into eq .  .",
    "for a better approach , we can solve the problem in another way , i.e. to solve eq .   by finding the minima of the potential function @xmath46 .",
    "this reduces to the famous problem of multidimensional minimization , and here we can use the efficient nelder - mead simplex algorithm .",

    "our results on the finite - volume effects have significant implications for heavy - ion collision experiments , because the strong interacting matter formed in a heavy - ion collision is finite in volume , and its size depends on the size of the colliding nuclei , the collision center of mass energy @xmath89 , and the centrality of the collision . in our concerned case ,",
    "@xmath89 and the centrality of collisions relate to the temperature @xmath11 and the chiral chemical potential @xmath1 when the colliding nuclei are chosen .",

    "to summarize , we have studied the chiral symmetry restoration and the deconfinement transition of the phase diagram of qcd by using the extended pnjl model in which chemical and chiral chemical potentials @xmath12 and @xmath1 are introduced .",
    "our results show that the discontinuity of the effective mass and polyakov loop parameter always vanishes at the same cep , and the chiral symmetry restoration and the deconfinement , the two transitions , coincide exactly .",

    "this implies that the continuation for cep of the qcd phase diagram to a fictitious cep belonging to a phase diagram in the @xmath1-@xmath11 plane is also meaningful .",
    "finally , it is found that the finite - volume effects become more and more manifest as @xmath4 , the radius of the size for the considered finite - volume , decreases and are more important for a smaller @xmath1 , by introducing a lower momentum cutoff in the integration in @xmath46 as eq .   to investigate the finite - volume effects in the pnjl model .",
    "numerical results show that the ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 are significantly affected by the system sizes with radius @xmath4 .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath6 for @xmath62 , and are estimated around , and respectively .",
    "therefore , the present results on the finite - volume effects indicate that when investigating the cep of qcd phases experimentally , the volume of strong interacting matter in the heavy - ion collision can not be small , otherwise the result on cep would be flexible .",

    "<S> to investigate finite - volume effects on the chiral symmetry restoration and the deconfinement transition and some impacts of possible global topological background for a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) system with @xmath0 ( two quark flavors ) , we apply the polyakov - loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio model by introducing a chiral chemical potential @xmath1 artificially . </S>",
    "<S> the final numerical results indicate that the introduced chiral chemical potential does not change the critical exponents but shifts the location of critical end point ( cep ) significantly ; the ratios for the chiral chemical potentials and temperatures at cep , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are significantly affected by the system size @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is that @xmath5 increases slowly with @xmath1 when @xmath4 is ` large ' and @xmath5 decreases first and then increases with @xmath1 when @xmath4 is ` small ' . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that for a fixed @xmath1 , there is a @xmath6 , where the critical end point vanishes , and the whole phase diagram becomes a crossover when @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we suggest that for the heavy - ion collision experiments , which is to study the possible location of cep , the finite - volume behavior should be taken into account . </S>"
