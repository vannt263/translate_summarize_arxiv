    "2 .   for which graphs @xmath5 in @xmath0",
    "is the maximum value of @xmath6 attained ?    throughout , we say that a graph @xmath5 is _ optimal _ in @xmath0 , if @xmath6 is maximum and we denote this maximum value by @xmath9 .",

    "p. erds @xcite commented that ",
    "the solution is more difficult than one would expect . \"",
    "ahlswede and katona were interested in an equivalent form of the problem : they wanted to find the maximum number of pairs of different edges that have a common vertex .",
    "in other words , they want to maximize the number of edges in the line graph @xmath10 as @xmath5 ranges over @xmath0 .",
    "that these two formulations of the problem are equivalent follows from an examination of the vertex - edge incidence matrix @xmath11 for a graph @xmath7 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the adjacency matrix of the line graph of @xmath5 .",
    "thus @xmath14 .",
    "( @xmath15 is twice the number of edges in the line graph of @xmath5 . )",
    "ahlswede and katona showed that the maximum value @xmath9 is always attained at one or both of two special graphs in @xmath0 .",
    "they called the first of the two special graphs a _",
    "quasi - complete _ graph .",
    "the quasi - complete graph in @xmath0 has the largest possible complete subgraph @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the unique integers such that    @xmath18    the quasi - complete graph in @xmath0 , which is denoted by @xmath19 , is obtained from the complete graph on the @xmath20 vertices @xmath21 by adding @xmath22 vertices @xmath23 , and the edges @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the other special graph in @xmath0 is the _ quasi - star _ , which we denote by @xmath26 .",
    "this graph has as many dominant vertices as possible .",
    "( a _ dominant vertex _ is one with maximum degree @xmath27 . )",
    "perhaps the easiest way to describe @xmath26 is to say that it is the graph complement of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "define the function @xmath30 to be the sum of the squares of the degree sequence of the quasi - complete graph in @xmath0 , and define @xmath31 to be the sum of the squares of the degree sequence of the quasi - star graph in @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath30 can be computed as follows :    let @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "the degree sequence of the quasi - complete graph in @xmath0 is @xmath34 hence @xmath35 since @xmath26 is the complement of @xmath28 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath36 from which it follows that , for fixed @xmath1 , the function @xmath37 is point - symmetric about the middle of the interval @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , @xmath39 it also follows from equation ( [ eqn : scconnection ] ) that @xmath19 is optimal in @xmath0 if and only if @xmath40 is optimal in @xmath41 .",

    "we denote it by @xmath44 and define @xmath45 to be the integer such that @xmath46 to state the results of @xcite we need one more notion , that of the distance from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",

    "our first main result , theorem [ thm : main1 ] , strengthens ahlswede and katona s theorem 2 ; not only does the maximum value of @xmath6 occur at either the quasi - star or quasi - complete graph in @xmath0 , but all optimal graphs in @xmath0 are related to the quasi - star or quasi - complete graphs via their so - called diagonal sequence . as a result of their relationship to the quasi - star and quasi - complete graphs , all optimal graphs can be and are described in our second main result , theorem [ thm : main2 ] .",
    "our third main result , theorem [ thm : main3 ] , is a refinement of lemma 8 in @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm : main3 ] characterizes the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for which @xmath65 and gives an explicit expression for the value @xmath59 in lemma 8 of @xcite .",

    "corollary [ cor : density ] answers the density question posed by ahlswede and katona .",
    "we have just recently learned that wagner and wang @xcite have independently answered this question as well .",
    "their approach is similar to ours , as they also find an expression for @xmath59 in lemma 8 of @xcite .    before stating the new results , we summarize work on the problem that followed @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the problem of maximizing the sum of the squares of the degree sequence was investigated by katz @xcite in 1971 and r. aharoni @xcite in 1980 .",
    "katz s problem was to maximize the sum of the elements in @xmath67 , where @xmath68 runs over all @xmath69-square matrices of size @xmath70 with precisely @xmath71 ones .",
    "he found the maxima and the matrices for which the maxima are attained for the special cases where there are @xmath72 ones or where there are @xmath73 ones in the @xmath69-matrix .",
    "aharoni @xcite extended katz s results for general @xmath71 and showed that the maximum is achieved at one of four possible forms for @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath68 is a symmetric @xmath69-matrix , with zeros on the diagonal , then @xmath68 is the adjacency matrix @xmath74 for a graph @xmath5 .",
    "now let @xmath5 be a graph in @xmath0 .",
    "then the adjacency matrix @xmath74 of @xmath5 is a @xmath75 @xmath69-matrix with @xmath76 ones . but",
    "@xmath74 satisfies two additional restrictions : @xmath74 is symmetric , and all diagonal entries are zero .",
    "however , the sum of all entries in @xmath77 is precisely @xmath78 . thus our problem is essentially the same as aharoni s in that",
    "both ask for the maximum of the sum of the elements in @xmath67 .",
    "the graph - theory problem simply restricts the set of @xmath69-matrices to those with @xmath76 ones that are symmetric and have zeros on the diagonal .",
    "olpp @xcite , apparently unaware of the work of ahlswede and katona , reproved the basic result that @xmath79 , but his results are stated in the context of two - colorings of a graph .",
    "he investigates a question of goodman @xcite : maximize the number of monochromatic triangles in a two - coloring of the complete graph with a fixed number of vertices and a fixed number of red edges .",
    "olpp shows that goodman s problem is equivalent to finding the two - coloring that maximizes the sum of squares of the red - degrees of the vertices .",
    "of course , a two - coloring of the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices gives rise to two graphs on @xmath1 vertices : the graph @xmath5 whose edges are colored red , and its complement @xmath80 .",
    "so goodman s problem is to find the maximum value of @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "olpp @xcite shows that either the quasi - star or the quasi - complete graph is optimal in @xmath0 , but he does not discuss which of the two values @xmath81 is larger .",
    "he leaves this question unanswered and he does not attempt to identify all optimal graphs in @xmath0 .    in 1999 ,",
    "peled , pedreschi , and sterbini @xcite showed that the only possible graphs for which the maximum value is attained are the so - called threshold graphs .",
    "the main result in @xcite is that all optimal graphs are in one of six classes of threshold graphs .",
    "they end with the remark ,  further questions suggested by this work are the existence and uniqueness of the [ graphs in @xmath0 ] in each class , and the precise optimality conditions . \"",
    "also in 1999 , byer @xcite approached the problem in yet another equivalent context : he studied the maximum number of paths of length two over all graphs in @xmath0 .",
    "every path of length two in @xmath5 represents an edge in the line graph @xmath10 , so this problem is equivalent to studying the graphs that achieve @xmath9 . for each @xmath8",
    ", byer shows that there are at most six graphs in @xmath0 that achieve the maximum .",
    "these maximal graphs come from among six general types of graphs for which there is at most one of each type in @xmath0 .",
    "he also extended his results to the problem of finding the maximum number of monochromatic triangles ( or any other fixed connected graph with 3 edges ) among two - colorings of the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices , where exactly @xmath2 edges are colored red .",
    "however , byer did not discuss how to compute @xmath9 , or how to determine when any of the six graphs is optimal .    in section",
    "[ sec : statements of main results ] , we have unified some of the earlier work on this problem by using partitions , threshold graphs , and the idea of a diagonal sequence .",
    "all optimal graphs come from a class of special graphs called _ threshold",
    "_ graphs . the quasi - star and quasi - complete graphs are just two among the many threshold graphs in @xmath0 .",
    "the adjacency matrix of a threshold graph has a special form .",
    "the upper - triangular part of the adjacency matrix of a threshold graph is left justified and the number of zeros in each row of the upper - triangular part of the adjacency matrix does not decrease .",
    "we will show adjacency matrices using  @xmath83 \" for the main diagonal , an empty circle  @xmath84 \" for the zero entries , and a black dot ,  @xmath85 \" for the entries equal to one .",
    "for example , the graph @xmath5 whose adjacency matrix is shown in figure [ fig : example643](a ) is a threshold graph in @xmath86 with degree sequence @xmath87 . by looking at the upper - triangular part of the adjacency matrix",
    ", we can associate the distinct partition @xmath88 of 13 with the graph . in general",
    ", the _ threshold _ graph @xmath89 corresponding to a distinct partition @xmath90 of @xmath2 , all of whose parts are less than @xmath1 , is the graph with an adjacency matrix whose upper - triangular part is left - justified and contains @xmath91 ones in row @xmath92 .",
    "thus the threshold graphs in @xmath0 are in one - to - one correspondence with the set of distinct partitions , @xmath93 of @xmath2 with all parts less than @xmath1 : @xmath94 we denote the adjacency matrix of the threshold graph @xmath95 corresponding to the distinct partition @xmath96 by @xmath97 .",
    "peled , pedreschi , and sterbini @xcite showed that all optimal graphs in a graph class @xmath0 must be threshold graphs .",
    "@xcite [ lem : optarethres ] if @xmath5 is an optimal graph in @xmath0 , then @xmath5 is a threshold graph .",
    "thus we can limit the search for optimal graphs to the threshold graphs .",
    "actually , a much larger class of functions , including the power functions , @xmath98 for @xmath99 , on the degrees of a graph are maximized only at threshold graphs .",
    "in fact , every schur convex function of the degrees is maximized only at the threshold graphs .",
    "the reason is that the degree sequences of threshold graphs are maximal with respect to the majorization order among all graphical sequences .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of majorization and schur convex functions and @xcite for a discussion of the degree sequences of threshold graphs .      to state the first main theorem",
    ", we must now digress to describe the diagonal sequence of a threshold graph in the graph class @xmath0 .",
    "returning to the example in figure [ fig : example643](a ) corresponding to the distinct partition @xmath100 , we superimpose diagonal lines on the adjacency matrix @xmath97 for the threshold graph @xmath95 as shown in figure [ fig : example643](b ) .",
    "the number of black dots in the upper triangular part of the adjacency matrix on each of the diagonal lines is called the _ diagonal sequence _ of the partition @xmath96 ( or of the threshold graph @xmath95 ) .",

    "theorem 2 in @xcite guarantees that one ( or both ) of the graphs @xmath109 must be optimal in @xmath0 .",
    "but there may be other optimal graphs in @xmath0 , as the next example shows .",

    "the adjacency matrices for these two graphs are shown in figure [ fig : adjequivgraphs ] .",
    "they have the same diagonal sequence @xmath116 and both are optimal .    we know that either the quasi - star or the quasi - complete graph in @xmath0 is optimal and that any threshold graph with the same diagonal sequence as an optimal graph is also optimal .",
    "in fact , the converse is also true .",
    "indeed , the relationship between the optimal graphs and the quasi - star and quasi - complete graphs in a graph class @xmath0 is described in our first main theorem .",
    "[ thm : main1 ]",
