    "a model consisting of an absorbed multi - temperature disk blackbody ( mitsuda et al .  1984 ) and",
    "an absorbed power - law fits the general broad - band spectral shape reasonably well ( table  [ tab : fits_pow ] ) .",
    "however , with the exception of the spectra obtained during observation 2 , deviations from the best - fit model are present which give rise to formally unacceptable values of @xmath7 . fitting the spectra with a combination of absorbed power - law and blackbody models gives similar results .",
    "the spectra were next fitted with an absorbed disk blackbody and a cut - off power - law model .",
    "this gives some improvement in fit quality , but is still unable to satisfactorily model the deviations , or `` wiggles '' , in the spectrum which are most prominent around @xmath120  kev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wiggles ] ) .",
    "these deviations prompted the use of a model which incorporates reflection such as pexriv in xspec which models a power - law reflected by ionized material ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the spectra were fit with the photon index , folding energy , relative reflection , and normalization as free parameters .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits_pexriv ] , with the exception of the folding energy , which was always much larger than highest energy used in the fit .",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath8 , was fixed at 1.0 ( corresponding to un - ionized material ) , since the fits are insensitive to changes in this parameter .",
    "the effects of reflection can be seen as deviations from a power - law continuum starting at @xmath110 kev and extending to 3040  kev in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1 ] . with this model",
    "the overall @xmath7  is significantly less than with a power - law and disk blackbody model , but individual values are still are not always formally acceptable . in comparison with the cutoff power - law model ,",
    "the values of @xmath7are similar for observation 1 , while for observations 24 the pexriv model gives marginally lower values of @xmath7  ( at 9094% confidence ) , and for observation 5 the reduction in @xmath7  is highly significant ( @xmath999.9999% confidence ) .",
    "the trends in , disk blackbody temperature , and inner disk radius are very similar whichever model is used for the hard component ( see e.g. tables [ tab : fits_pow ] and [ tab : fits_pexriv ] ) . therefore the conclusions in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] with regard to the derived disk blackbody parameters do not depend on the assumed hard - component model .",
    "tables  [ tab : fits_pow ] and [ tab : fits_pexriv ] reveal that the temperature of the disk blackbody decreased and the inferred inner disk radius increased as the outburst progressed ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] ) . to investigate whether these changes could be artefacts of the fitting procedure , the correlations between the disk blackbody normalization ( proportional to the square of the inner disk radius ) and",
    "the power - law slope and disk blackbody temperature were investigated .",
    "large changes are apparent in these quantities and a ( very ) strong correlation between parameters could give rise to an apparent change in the inner disk radius ( which should then not be interpreted in a physical way ) . in order to check that this is not the case , contour - plots corresponding to large changes in @xmath10(@xmath11 @xmath10=10 , 20 ) were produced .",
    "the confidence contours do not overlap for the different observations since the differences between the obtained parameters are an order of magnitude larger than the size of the confidence contours for these already large @xmath10differences .",
    "this analysis reveals that the observed changes are _ much _ larger than can be explained as due to correlations between fit parameters .",
    "the observed changes in the spectral parameters therefore reflect physical changes .",
    "power spectra of  were searched for any distinctive features such as quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "none were found .",
    "however , the quality of the power spectra is rather poor ( a much better analysis can be done with e.g.  rxte data ) and so a more detailed timing analysis was not attempted .    during the _ bepposax _  observation of  in its quiescent state ( on 1997 march 2627 ) ,",
    "was not detected .",
    "however , due to the presence of a number of nearby sources and the relatively poor lecs and mecs spatial resolution , it is difficult to separate the contributions from nearby faint sources .",
    "the 3@xmath12 upper limit to the mecs count rate is 1.2@xmath13  s@xmath6 .",
    "this translates into an upper limit on the 210 kev unabsorbed flux of 1.9@xmath14 ergs s@xmath6 , for an assumed distance of 10 kpc , a photon index of 2.1 , and an  of 8@xmath15  ( close to lowest value obtained ) .",
    "this photon index is the value obtained for the black hole candidate gs2023 + 338 in quiescence by narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . the corresponding value for the unabsorbed 210  kev flux for an  of 2.0@xmath15 ( the galactic value ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) is 1.0@xmath14 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "this upper limit is similar to previous limits for the flux of  in quiescence ( see parmar et al .",
    "the _ bepposax _  observations of  during its 1998 outburst reveal a decreasing , a hardening of a power - law like component , a decreasing disk blackbody temperature , and an increasing inferred inner disk radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] ) .",
    "these first two changes were also observed during the 1986 outburst of  by parmar et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and in other x - ray transients ( e.g.  gs2023 + 338 ; oosterbroek et al .",
    "the change in  may suggest that the initial outburst onset is a rather dramatic event , which leaves significant amounts of material around the compact object , which later on is either accreted , or expelled from the system .    the inner disk radius ( which has been interpreted as the radius of the innermost stable orbit around a black hole ; ebisawa 1991 ) increased by a factor of 4 ( fig .  [ fig : param ] ) during the part of the outburst observed by _",
    "bepposax_. therefore it is clearly not related ( at least in a simple way ) to the innermost stable orbit .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar phenomenon , as seen in grs1915 + 105 by belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , may be evident here : the inner part of the accretion disk changes its state such that it does not contribute to the x - ray flux .",
    "however , in grs1915 + 105 this occurs on a much shorter time scale of seconds to minutes .",
    "the fact that the best - fit temperature at the inner disk radius decreased during the outburst supports this interpretation - it is just the result of the change in effective inner disk radius .",
    "the relation between the best - fit inner disk radii and temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_radius ] . comparing this to the theoretical temperature profile of a standard shakura - sunyaev disk ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the surface temperature and r the radius ) , shows a qualitive agreement .",
    "we note that this relation is , strictly speaking , only valid for radii much larger than the inner disk radius . since the mass accretion rate , @xmath18 this implies that @xmath19 is approximately constant during the part of the outburst observed by _",
    "bepposax _",
    "( if the contribution from the non - thermal component is excluded ) , and that the inner part of the accretion disk progressively changed its state to produce the observed spectral changes .",
    "this behavior is quite different from outbursts of the transients gs1124@xmath2068 , groj1655@xmath2040 and gs2000 + 25 and from the persistent source lmcx-3 observed by _",
    "ginga _ and rxte . in those sources",
    "the best - fit inferred inner disk radii remain approximately constant during the entire outburst ( gs2000 + 25 ) , or until the late stages ( @xmath2150  days ) of the outburst ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 ; ebisawa et al .  1994 ; sobczak et al .",
    "this difference is unlikely to be caused by the broad energy coverage of _ bepposax _ , which allows the underlying power - law(-like ) spectrum to be well constrained , since the _ ginga _ and rxte energy ranges extend far beyond where the disk blackbody contributes to the flux .",
    "another difference with respect to the above sources is that their disk blackbody temperatures are @xmath211  kev , compared to @xmath12  kev with  near the peak of the outburst .",
    "a similar high temperature was observed in grs1915 + 105 ( belloni et al .",
    "we speculate that the difference in spectral properties may be related to the difference in outburst recurrence intervals between  ( 1.6  yrs ) and the other soft x - ray transients which have typical recurrence intervals @xmath225  yrs . this may suggest that a different mechanism is responsible for the outbursts in , which also gives rise to a different behavior during the outburst .",
    "the fact that the inner part of the accretion disk disappears slowly ( and smoothly ) suggests that the matter accretes into the black hole ( as opposed to the sudden phase transition observed in grs1915 + 105 ) .",
    "this , in turn , may cause a drop in @xmath22 at the inner edge , which is needed to cause the end of an outburst in irradiated disks ( see king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "the increase in the best fit inner disk radius is compatibible with the model of esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who assume that accretion takes place through a shakura - sunyaev disk beyond some truncation radius , but within this radius the flow jumps to the advective solution .",
    "they model the change from a high to a low state as an increase in the radius where the character of the flow changes .",
    "the observed increase in best - fit inner disk radius may therefore simply reflect the outward expansion of the radius where optically thick material is present as the outburst evolved .",
    "we note that the best - fit values for the inner disk radius are lower than the value ( 3 schwarzschild radii , the innermost marginally stable orbit ) for the high state in the esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) model .",
    "however , we have assumed that the disk is viewed face - on ( an inclination angle of 0@xmath23 ) , while there are indications that the inclination is in the range 6075@xmath23 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "in addition , the distance to the source is uncertain . these factors may result in larger values for the `` real '' inner disk radius .",
    "ycki et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also find much smaller values for the inner disk radius from their modeling of the spectra of gs1124@xmath2068 , compared to the values predicted in esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the changing inferred inner disk radius has implications for the method applied by zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to determine black hole spin .",
    "they calculate the general relativistic effects of black hole rotation on the inner disk regions , which allows the obtained disk blackbody temperatures and inner disk radii to be interpreted in terms of the spin of the black hole .",
    "our results suggest that other processes also affect the spectrum ( since a change of black hole spin can be excluded on a time scale of @xmath140 days ) , which cautions against interpreting spectral properties in term of black hole parameters alone .",
    "the nature of the hard component in  is unclear .",
    "although a reflection model provides the lowest overall @xmath7 , this does not necessarily mean that significant reflection is occuring in the system .",
    "the largest reduction in @xmath7  using the pexriv model compared to a power - law is obtained when the fitted relative reflection is high , which _ does _ mean that the deviations from a power - law , to first order , can be modeled with a reflection component",
    ". however , the values of @xmath7  are not always formally acceptable , which suggests that , although the pexriv model gives a better overall fit then a power - law or a cutoff power - law , the detailed modeling of the reflected component is unsatisfactory .",
    "we note that the fits to the exosat spectra also gave formally unacceptable @xmath10  values , although parmar et al .",
    "( 1986 ) used a different model consisting of a wien - like soft component and a power - law .",
    "it appears that the spectrum of  is complex and contains features which can not be currently modeled in a realistic way .",
    "the amount of reflection in the pexriv model ( see table [ tab : fits_pexriv ] ) increased , compared to the underlying continuum , as the outburst decayed .",
    "however , there is no obvious correlation between the amount of relative reflection and the normalizations of the disk blackbody and power - law , as modeled with the pexriv model , suggesting that any reflected component is neither constant nor directly related to the strengths of either spectral component .",
    "the weakness of the `` wiggles '' during observation 2 coincided with the peak of the outburst , as can be seen from the rxte asm light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "this may be coincidence , or it could be that the continuum becomes `` smoother '' near the maximum of the outburst as a rule .",
    "we note that the residuals in the @xmath147 kev range become significantly less if a narrow gaussian component is added , suggesting the presence of a weak ( @xmath130  ev equivalent width ) iron line ( obs .  3 ) .",
    "however , the residuals are at the 23% level , comparable to the systematic uncertainties . in comparison with active galactic nuclei where",
    "reflection components and associated iron fluorescence lines have been detected from a number of systems ( e.g. , pounds et al .",
    "1990 ) , the lack of intense ( @xmath2100  ev equivalent width ) iron emission from   is surprizing , if reflection is important in this system .",
    "however , we note that during a broad band x - ray telescope observation of the blackhole candidate cygx-1 by marshall et al .",
    "( 1993 ) also showed evidence for reflection by material surrounding the central source , but only a narrow line at 6.4  kev with an equivalent width of @xmath24  ev was possibly detected .",
