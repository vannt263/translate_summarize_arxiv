    "superbolides are extremely bright meteors , brighter in maximum than absolute ( i.e.  as seen from the distance of 100 km ) visual magnitude of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although bolide brightness depends on many parameters , e.g.  meteoroid size , structure , and composition , entry speed and entry angle , we can roughly say that superbolides are caused by meteoroids of the sizes of the order of one meter and larger .",
    "in fact , meter - sized bodies are now often called asteroids rather than meteoroids @xcite . regardless the terminology , bodies of these sizes belong to the least known objects in the solar system .",
    "current astronomical telescopes are sensitive enough to detect them when passing within few hundreds of thousands kilometers from the earth , nevertheless , rarely is more information obtained than the orbit .",
    "even the size is only approximate if albedo is not known .",
    "properties , and in particular internal structure , of small asteroids are , nevertheless , of great interest from several reasons . rotational rates of asteroids larger than about 200 meters ( and smaller than about 10 km ) suggest that large majority of them are weakly bound gravitational aggregates , so called rubble piles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "smaller asteroids rotate generally much faster and can be monolithic , although it was suggested that many of them may be rubble piles as well , bound together by small van der waals forces @xcite . clarifying the question",
    "if small asteroids are monolithic or aggregates would shed light to the impact processes , in which these bodies are born .",
    "but even monolithic materials can have various structures and strengths , depending on the presence of cracks and other failures .",
    "finally , even pristine solar system materials have significant diversity as evidenced by meteorites , ranging from hard pure metals to relatively soft carbonaceous bodies .",
    "although meteorites are our best source of knowledge about microscopic and small - scale properties of asteroidal material , they are telling only part of the story .",
    "first , meteorites represent only the strongest parts of the original meteoroid or asteroid  the part , which was able to survive the atmospheric flight .",
    "second , there are certainly meter - sized objects that are so weak that they do not drop any meteorites .",
    "an example was the body which produced the umava superbolide @xcite .",
    "the structure of small asteroids is of interest not only from purely scientific reasons .",
    "there are ideas of future retrieval and exploitation of small asteroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the knowledge of physical properties of the target asteroid would be certainly crucial for the success of such an attempt .",
    "small asteroids also pose non - negligible hazard when they enter the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the hazard was demonstrated by the crater producing carancas impact @xcite and by the damaging blast wave produced by the chelyabinsk entry @xcite .",
    "the actual effects on the ground caused by each particular entry depend to large extent on the internal structure of the impactor .    observations of superbolides can , in fact , most easily provide information about the structure of meter - sized asteroids .",
    "superbolides , however , are extremely rare events when observed from one site or from a limited region .",
    "@xcite compiled 13 bolides from decades long observations by three fireball networks ( plus one satellite tracked bolide ) , which he believed were all produced by bodies larger than 1 meter .",
    "he classified them according to the pe criterion developed earlier for smaller bolides @xcite and based on bolide end height .",
    "five of the 14 bodies were classified as soft cometary ( the weakest known material ) .",
    "the remaining ones were mostly classified as carbonaceous .",
    "these results were not confirmed by the recent study of @xcite , which was based mostly on data from the us government sensors obtained on global scale .",
    "the available data about 47 superbolides included only the location , height of maximum , velocity vector , and total radiated energy .",
    "only one event had very high maximum ( 59 km ) , suggesting its cometary nature .",
    "the others had maxima at wide range of heights , 19  45 km , without obvious grouping . while those penetrating deeply were likely compact stones or metals , the nature of most bodies is not possible to judge from the data . they may have been fractured objects or bodies composed from weaker ( e.g.  carbonaceous ) material .",
    "@xcite compiled data on 13 instrumentally observed meteorite falls .",
    "they were able to compare the atmospheric behavior with the properties of the recovered meteorites .",
    "more detailed observational data enabled the authors to find individual fragmentation points along the bolide trajectories . for all ordinary chondrites ,",
    "the inferred strength of the incoming body was found to be one to two orders of magnitude lower than the meteorite tensile strength , presumably as a result of their collisional history .",
    "low strength of some carbonaceous bodies may result , on the other hand , from their porous structures , more than fractures .",
    "the study of @xcite was restricted to meteorite dropping events ( of all sizes ) and the study of @xcite was based on very limited amount of data for individual events . here",
    "we take advantage of good observational data we collected on the superbolide which occurred over romania on january 7 , 2015 .",
    "it was a very bright event caused by a meter - sized asteroid but did not drop meteorites ( at least none was found and none larger than few grams could be expected ) .",
    "in addition to photographic and video records we have also obtained detailed radiometric light curves and we could model the atmospheric behavior of the body .",
    "the results could be compared with the modeling of three other superbolides of similar brightness , one ordinary chondrite , one carbonaceous chondrite , and one cometary body .",
    "the january 7 , 2015 , superbolide was also among those observed by the us government sensors and we can compare our trajectory and orbital data with those reported by @xcite .",

    "<S> the trajectory , velocity , and orbit were determined using two all - sky photographs from a station of the european fireball network ( en ) in slovakia and five casual video records from romania , which were carefully calibrated . </S>",

    "<S> the orbit was asteroidal with low inclination and aphelion inside jupiter s orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the atmospheric behavior was , however , not typical for an asteroidal body . </S>",
    "<S> the peak brightness of absolute magnitude of @xmath2 was reached at a quite large height of 42.8 km and the brightness then decreased quickly . </S>",
    "<S> the bolide almost disappeared at a height of 38.7 km , leaving just a stationary luminous trail visible for several seconds . </S>",
    "<S> only one small fragment continued until the height of 36 km . </S>",
    "<S> brief meteorite searches were unsuccessful . </S>",
    "<S> the modeling of the light curve revealed that the body of initial mass of about 4500 kg remained almost intact until the dynamic pressure reached 0.9 mpa but it was then quickly disintegrated into many tiny fragments and dust under 13 mpa . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison was made with three other superbolides for which we have radiometric light curves : ordinary chondrite fall koice , carbonaceous chondrite fall maribo , and cometary taurid bolide of october 31 , 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> the romanian superbolide was not similar to any of these and represents probably a new type of material with intrinsic strength of about 1 mpa .    </S>",
