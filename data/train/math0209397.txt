    "the universal covering conjecture states that whenever @xmath4 is a closed , connected , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold with infinite cyclic fundamental group , then its universal covering space must be homeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "valentin ponaru has announced a proof of this conjecture @xcite .",
    "his proof is the outgrowth of a massive project which investigates the structure of simply connected 3-manifolds .",
    "he translates the problem into another problem in higher dimensions , solves that problem , and then uses the result to solve the original 3-dimensional problem .",
    "his methods are highly original and perhaps not that familiar to most 3-manifold toplogists .",
    "( see @xcite for an introduction to some of ponaru s techniques . )",
    "the present paper continues an investigation of an alternative approach to the universal covering conjecture which uses more traditional 3-manifold techniques .",
    "an irreducible contractible open 3-manifold which is not homeomorphic to @xmath1  is called a _",
    "whitehead manifold_. thus one wants to show that whitehead manifolds can not cover compact 3-manifolds .",
    "in @xcite i showed that genus one whitehead manifolds ( those which are monotone unions of solid tori ) can not non - trivially cover any 3-manifold .",
    "wright then showed in @xcite that the same result is true for the much larger class of _ eventually end irreducible _ whitehead manifolds ; his proof was based on the interplay of two new ideas : the `` ratchet lemma '' ( which uses the assumption of eventual end irreducibility ) and the `` orbit lemma '' ( which does not ) .",
    "tinsley and wright @xcite then extended this result to certain examples of whitehead manifolds which are not eventually end irreducible ; these manifolds contain a family of disjoint proper planes which split them into an infinite collection of certain genus one whitehead manifolds . their proof that these whitehead manifolds can not non - trivially cover any other 3-manifolds is based on the orbit lemma and an extension of the ratchet lemma called the special ratchet lemma which applies to whitehead manifolds which split along proper planes into eventually end irreducible whitehead manifolds .",
    "they also gave other examples of manifolds of this type which could non - trivially cover other non - compact 3-manifolds ; however , their methods did not rule out their covering compact 3-manifolds .",
    "in @xcite i used the special ratchet lemma and the orbit lemma to show that certain whitehead manifolds which covered non - compact 3-manifolds with free fundamental groups could cover only 3-manifolds with free fundamental groups , and so could not cover compact 3-manifolds .",
    "these examples are different from those of @xcite but like them they can be split along a family of proper planes into eventually end irreducible whitehead manifolds .",
    "one can associate to this decomposition a tree whose vertices correspond to the eventually end irreducible whitehead manifolds and whose edges correspond to the planes . for these examples i showed that the decomposition is unique up to ambient isotopy",
    ". thus the isotopy class of any self - homeomorphism induces an automorphism of the tree .",
    "when the self - homeomorphism is a non - trivial covering translation the special ratchet lemma and the orbit lemma can be used to show that the automorphism does not fix any points of the tree .",
    "it follows that the group of covering translations is isomorphic to the corresponding group of automorphisms and that this group is free .",
    "this paper explores the situation when the whitehead manifold is not eventually end irreducible and can not be split into eventually end irreducible pieces by a collection of proper planes .",
    "it turns out that even in this situation the manifold still contains some very useful open submanifolds which are eventually end irreducible .",
    "they are called _",
    "end reductions_. they were developed by brin and thickstun @xcite as a tool in their study of the ends of non - compact 3-manifolds .",
    "an elementary example of an end reduction is one of the eventually end irreducible pieces into which the collection of planes breaks a whitehead manifold of the type described above ; such an example has topological boundary consisting of the planes adjacent to it .",
    "in general , however , an end reduction is embedded in a very contorted manner in the manifold containing it and has a very complicated topological boundary .    in this paper",
    "an extension of the special ratchet lemma called the `` end reduction ratchet lemma '' is proven . this result and the orbit lemma are used to prove that a non - trivial covering translation of a whitehead manifold can not fix the isotopy class of an end reduction .",
    "the isotopy in this statement need not be an ambient isotopy ; it can refer to a non - ambient isotopy of embedding maps .    in order to apply this theorem",
    "one needs some structure on the set of isotopy classes of end reductions .",
    "we define an object called the _ simplicial complex of minimal @xmath3-irreducible  end reductions _ of a whitehead manifold @xmath0 , denoted @xmath2 .",
    "an end reduction @xmath5 of @xmath0 is _ minimal _ if the only end reductions of @xmath0 that it contains are isotopic to it .",
    "it is @xmath3-irreducible  if it does not contain any proper planes which split it in a non - trivial fashion .",
    "two isotopy classes of end reductions are joined by an edge if there is an isotopically unique @xmath3-irreducible  end reduction @xmath6 containing representatives @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the vertices such that every end reduction of @xmath0 which is contained in @xmath6 is isotopic to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath6 .",
    "simplices of higher dimension are defined by an inductive extension of this definition .    in @xcite scott and",
    "tucker gave an example of a whitehead manifold which is not eventually end irreducible , which is an infinite cyclic covering space of a non - compact 3-manifold , and which was purported to be @xmath3-irreducible .",
    "unfortunately this example contained a mistake which resulted in its not being @xmath3-irreducible .",
    "in @xcite i showed how to modify this example to make it @xmath3-irreducible . in the present paper",
    "i determine @xmath2 for this modified example and uncountably many non - homeomorphic variations of it . in all cases",
    "@xmath2 is a triangulation of the real line .",
    "it follows that any 3-manifold which it non - trivially covers must have infinite cyclic fundamental group .",
    "a further variation produces uncountably many examples which can not non - trivially cover any 3-manifold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review brin and thickstun s theory of end reductions and prove that any end reduction of a whitehead manifold is a whitehead manifold .",
    "end reductions are associated to certain compact subsets ; we speak of an end reduction _ at _ the compact set . in this section",

    "we prove the end reduction ratchet lemma . in section 4",
    "we apply it and the orbit lemma to show that a non - trivial covering translation can not fix the isotopy class of an end reduction . in the next two sections",
    "some further results about end reductions are proven which will be needed later . in section 5",
    "it is shown that the end reductions associated to nested compact sets have representatives which are themselves nested ; moreover , the smaller end reduction is an end reduction of the larger end reduction . in section 6",
    "it is shown that any @xmath3-irreducible  end reduction can be isotoped off any non - trivial plane .",

    "we prove that these manifolds are @xmath3-irreducible .",
    "we also associate to each finite set of integers @xmath11 a certain open subset @xmath12 of @xmath0 .",
    "it is a whitehead manifold .",
    "we prove that it is @xmath3-irreducible  if and only if the integers are consecutive . in section 11 we prove that @xmath12 is a genus one whitehead manifold if and only if @xmath11 has a single element . in section 12",
