    "some time ago ahmed@xcite solved the schrdinger equation with the pt - symmetric potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 exactly and found an interesting behaviour of the corresponding point spectra . in both cases there is an infinite number of real eigenvalues when @xmath2 and as @xmath3 increases the number of real eigenvalues decreases to just one . at every finite nonzero value of @xmath3 there is an odd number of real eigenvalues ( say @xmath4 ) and",
    "as @xmath3 increases this number reduces to @xmath5 .",
    "ahmed did not explain this phenomenom satisfactorily and did not identify the critical @xmath3 values at which each change takes place .",
    "however , he proposed to call it _ scarcity of real discrete eigenvalues_.    the purpose of this paper is to provide a more detailed discussion of the behaviour of the spectra of those models . in section  [ sec : perturbation ]",
    "we outline some properties of the perturbation series for a particular class of parameter - dependent hamiltonians and in section  [ sec : models ] we discuss the spectra of the models mentioned above .",
    "finaly , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "let @xmath6 be a parameter - dependent linear operator and @xmath7 a linear invertible operator such that @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath9 is an eigenfunction of @xmath6 with eigenvalue @xmath10 then it follows from @xmath11 that @xmath12 is proportional to an eigenfunction @xmath13 of @xmath14 with eigenvalue @xmath15 here , we are interested in the case that @xmath16 is an hermitian operator . since equation ( [ eq : em(-l)=en(l ) ] ) is assumed to be valid for all @xmath17 we conclude that @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , if the eigenvalues of @xmath16 are nondegenerate then @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath17 .",
    "if the eigenvalue @xmath10 can be expanded in a taylor series about @xmath21 @xmath22 then @xmath23 for all@xmath24 . if this expansion converges for @xmath25 then @xmath26 is real for all @xmath27 provided that @xmath3 and the perturbation coefficients @xmath28 are real .",
    "as indicated in the introduction ahmed@xcite briefly discussed two exactly - solvable one - dimensional pt - symmetric models .",
    "one of them is given by @xmath29 where , @xmath30=i$ ] .",
    "in this case the parity transformation @xmath31 yields @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . this hamiltonian operator satisfies the conditions discussed in the preceding section and is pt - symmetric when @xmath34 , @xmath3 real , because @xmath35 ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ahmed@xcite proved that when @xmath34 the eigenvalues are solutions to the nonlinear equation @xmath36 = 0 ,   \\label{eq : d(e , g)}\\ ] ] and from a straightforward numerical calculation he conjectured that the number of real eigenvalues decreases from infinity ( @xmath2 ) to just one ( for a sufficiently large value of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that as @xmath3 increases from @xmath2 a pair of eigenvalues @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , approach each other , coalesce at @xmath40 and become a pair of complex conjugate numbers for @xmath41 .",
    "the only eigenvalue that appears to remain real for all @xmath3 is @xmath42 .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that there is just one real eigenvalue when @xmath43@xcite that is the potential for the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath44 ) of ( [ eq : h_model1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , from the canonical transformation @xmath45 with @xmath46 we easily prove that @xmath47    numerical calculation shows that the critical points @xmath48 decrease with @xmath49 so that for a given value of @xmath3 only the pairs of eigenvalues with @xmath50 are real .",
    "when @xmath51 there is only one real eigenvalue ( @xmath42 ) and when @xmath52 there are @xmath53 real eigenvalues .",
    "this fact explains why ahmed@xcite obtained an odd number of real eigenvalues for every @xmath54 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : coalescence ] illustrates the coalescence of the eigenvalues @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "ahmed@xcite suggests that there is just one real eigenvalue for @xmath57 ; however , our calculation shows that there are three real eigenvalues : @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "he probably missed the two eigenvalues @xmath55 and @xmath56 because they are quite close to each other or due to insufficient accuracy in the calculation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : d(e , g ) ] ) yields either @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "if we take into account that @xmath63 when @xmath64 and @xmath3 are linked by @xmath65 then we find that @xmath66 therefore , the coalescence points that are given by @xmath67 ( square - root branch points ) can be easily obtained by solving the system of nonlinear equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath68 table  [ tab : cp1 ] shows the first five critical points ( note that @xmath69 ) .",
    "as argued in the preceding section , the application of perturbation theory to the model ( [ eq : h_model1 ] ) should yield a @xmath70-series for every eigenvalue @xmath71 . since both @xmath16 and @xmath72 are real , then the coefficients @xmath73 are real .",
    "the first three terms of the perturbation series for the first three eigenvalues are :    @xmath74 { g}^{4}+\\ldots   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 0.5000000000 + 2.693147181g^{2}-15.85255355g^{4}+\\ldots \\label{eq : e0_series}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath75 { g}^{4}+\\ldots   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 1.500000000 + 9.238324625g^{2}-49.30966898g^{4}+\\ldots   \\label{eq : e1_series}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath76 { g}^{4}+\\ldots   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2.500000000 + 14.82867952g^{2}-90.5745397g^{2}+\\ldots   \\label{eq : e2_series}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is the zeta function .",
    "the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the pair of eigenvalues @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath78 is expected to be @xmath48 .",
    "the eigenvalues for the second model @xmath79 when @xmath34 , are roots of the nonlinear expression@xcite @xmath80 the behaviour of the spectrum of the pt - symmetric hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_model2 ] ) is similar to the one discussed above in all relevant aspects except one . in this case",
    "the strong - coupling limit is given by the canonical transformation ( [ eq : can_transf ] ) with @xmath81 and @xmath82 bender and boettcher@xcite proved that this model does not exhibit eigenvalues and that the ground state of @xmath83 diverges as @xmath84 .",
    "this is the most relevant difference with respect to the preceding example .",
    "the first four critical points of the spectrum of ( [ eq : h_model2 ] ) are shown in table  [ tab : cp2 ] .",
    "the two pt - symmetric hamiltonians discussed in the preceding section exhibit critical points @xmath85 that decrease with @xmath86 ( we omit the consideration of the case @xmath87 because @xmath88 ) .",
    "since it appears that @xmath89 the number of real eigenvalues is finite for all @xmath90 .",
    "this result is important because it may shed light on the spectra of a family of pt - symmetric multidimensional oscillators with critical points that decrease with the magnitude of the coalescing eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "present results suggest that the pt - phase transition@xcite for the hamiltonians ( [ eq : h_model1 ] ) and ( [ eq : h_model2 ] ) takes place at the trivial hermitian limit @xmath2 .",
    "such a behaviour commonly takes place in multidimensional problems that exhibit some kind of point - group symmetry@xcite .",
    "for this reason the results above for one - dimensional models that merely exhibit parity symmetry @xmath91 appear to be quite interesting .",
