    "the main goal of heavy - ion physics is to study the new phase of matter predicted by quantum chromodynamics to exist at high energy density , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "an important observable used to characterize its properties is the anisotropic flow  @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow , @xmath0 , is the second harmonic coefficient in a fourier series expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution measured with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "the reaction plane is spanned by the beam axis @xmath5 and the impact parameter vector .",
    "there are two main issues not related to the initial geometry that complicate the flow measurements : non - flow ( other sources of azimuthal correlations ) and event - by - event flow fluctuations .",
    "the large elliptic flow observed at rhic showed that the matter created in heavy - ion collisions behaves as a nearly `` perfect '' fluid whose constituent particles interact very strongly  @xcite .",
    "the alice collaboration reported that , compared to rhic energies the differential elliptic flow ( @xmath6  gev / c ) does not change within uncertainties at lhc energies , but the integrated elliptic flow increases by about 30%  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the @xmath7 reach up to 20  gev / c for unidentified charged particles @xmath0 in alice ; also charged pions and ( anti)protons @xmath0 were measured up to @xmath2  gev / c .",
    "the data recorded by the alice experiment  @xcite during the november - december 2010 lhc heavy - ion run were used in this paper . the time projection chamber ( tpc )",
    "was used for tracking , particle identification and reconstruction of the event plane .",
    "other detectors , e.g. zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) and vzero , were employed to determine the event plane .",
    "the event sample was collected with a dedicated minimum bias trigger . in order to remove beam induced background events ,",
    "an offline event selection is applied .",
    "furthermore , only events with a reconstructed primary vertex within @xmath8 cm along the beam axis are selected for this analysis .",
    "such a selection leads to around 14.5 million events .",
    "only charged particles with @xmath9  gev / c are selected in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath10 .",
    "a glauber model fit to the distribution of the summed amplitudes in the vzero scintillator detectors was used to estimate the centrality of the collision  @xcite .     for pb - pb collisions in the centrality bin 30 - 40% from various analysis techniques .",
    "the solid lines are the estimated non - flow correction factors from pp data using the @xmath11 method without any @xmath12 gap ( green ) and with an @xmath12 gap , @xmath13 ( red ) . the gray band represents the systematic uncertainty for the @xmath13 methods .",

    "the systematic uncertainty is depicted by the gray band.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this analysis several experimental methods were investigated : the event plane method , and two and four particle correlations . for the first , the event plane was determined from tpc tracks ( @xmath18 ) and vzero signals ( @xmath17 ) . in the case of two particle correlations the scalar product method ( @xmath14 ) was employed , while for four particle correlations the analysis was performed using the cumulant method ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "furthermore , the charged particle elliptic flow is also calculated with the reaction plane determined from directed flow of neutral spectators measured with the zdc ( @xmath16 ) . for a detailed description of the methods and notation see  @xcite .",
    "an important part of the analysis is devoted to the removal of non - flow contributions .",
    "this is done by introducing an @xmath12 gap ( @xmath19 ) and correlating particles from @xmath20 with particles from @xmath21 and vice - versa .",
    "when the @xmath12 gap is increased ( using vzero to determine the event plane ) , the non - flow is suppressed even more .",
    "we estimate the remaining non - flow contribution by applying the @xmath11 method on pp data at the same energy , in which the correction is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an average flow for each centrality bin and @xmath24 is the mean multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2_mth_comp ] ( left ) shows the @xmath7-differential elliptic flow measured for centrality bin 30 - 40% using various analysis techniques .",
    "the estimated non - flow corrections are depicted by the solid lines .",
