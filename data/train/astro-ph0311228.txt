    "properties of the radioemission from the most rapidly spinning disk population millisecond radio pulsars ( msps ) support the neutron star model - based expectation that these pulsars should be mainly orthogonal rotators or aligned rotators .",
    "there are three kinds of observational evidence for this .",
    "\\1 ) a large fraction of the msps have two radio - subpulses of comparable strength separated in time by about half a period ( p/2 ) , a signature property of an orthogonal rotator ( chen & ruderman 1993 , jayawardhana & grindlay 1996 ) . in a sample of 8 of the fastest spinning disk - msps at least 4 , and possibly 6 ,",
    "are in this category ( chen et al 1998 ) ; among canonical radiopulsars only a few percent are ( lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "\\2 ) the well studied original msp , psr 1937 , is observed to have very different linear polarization properties in two narrow radio - subpulses an interval p/2 apart , just as expected from the spin - up evolution of that pulsar into an orthogonal rotator whose dipole moment is on the neutron star s ( ns s ) spin - axis at the ns crust - core interface ( cr 93 ) .",
    "\\3 ) at least one pulsar in the chosen msp octet , psr j0437 - 4715 , and possibly several , have only a single very broad , structured radiopulse .",
    "its pulse - width is so large ( @xmath0270@xmath1 = 3p/4 ) that a plausible description of the observed radiation beam seems to require an almost aligned beam ( and dipole moment ) observed from a line - of - sight direction near that of the ns s spin - axis ( gil & krawczyk 97 ) .",
    "because an almost spin - aligned radiobeam from a spinning ns sweeps out a smaller solid angle on the sky then that same beam would from an orthogonal rotator , one observation of an aligned msp out of the 8 in the sample indicates a very considerably larger aligned fraction .    in section 2",
    "we consider the significance of msp low energy x - ray light - curves when these data are combined with those from the same msps radiopulses .",
    "section 3 summarizes relevant ns model predictions fro stellar magnetic field evolution as these stars were spun - up to become msps .",
    "section 4 presents model predictions for an aligned msp s thermal x - ray emission areas and compares them to those inferred from psr j0437 observations . in no case",
    "is there a conflict between what is expected from special properties of nss and what is observed .",
    "low energy ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) x - ray emission has been reported from 6 msps previously identified by their pulsed radioemission .",
    "the 6 x - ray and radio light curves are shown in figure 1 ( becker and aschenbach 2002 ) .",
    "the upper curves show those for x - ray emission , the lower ones for radioemission .",
    "there is no significant difference between the radio and x - ray profiles except possibly in psr 0218 ( fig.1 upper middle ) and psr 1821 ( fig.1 upper left ) . in those two",
    "msps the x - ray light curves seem to resolve an ambiguity : their radioemission light curve profiles contain a sub - peak structure from the double crossing of a hollow cone beam rather than emission from three truly separate beams . among the 6 msps of figure 1 ,",
    "five reinforce support for the orthogonal rotator interpretation suggested by the radio light curves .",
    "one , psr j0437 , clearly does not .",
    "however , its single very broad x - ray light curve does not contradict the nearly aligned rotator interpretation for it .",
    "why observed x - ray emission from a hot polar cap can be so strongly phase - modulated even though the observer s line - of -sight is near the spin axis is discussed in crz 98 .",
    "we consider next why msp genesis based upon very prolonged spin - up of older nss with initially nearly canonical dipole moments can lead to much weaker dipole moments and , preferentially , to orthogonal or aligned rotators .",
    "soon after its birth a canonical ns is well described ( except , possibly , for a small central region ) as an almost uniformly rotating fluid core ( radius r = 10 km ) of neutrons ( n ) together with protons ( p ) and electrons several percent as abundant .",
    "this core is surrounded by a thin solid crust of thickness @xmath2 1 km . early in its life ( age @xmath3 years )",
    "the core will have cooled sufficiently that its neutrons become superfluid ( sf - n ) and its protons superconducting ( sc - p ) .",
    "a core of sf - n can not rotate uniformly . instead , the nearly uniform vorticity of 4 @xmath4/p in a rotating normal fluid fragments into a very dense almost parallel array of quantized vortex lines . the sf - n vortex number density ( per unit area )    @xmath5    these vortices",
    "are represented by the eight straight vertical lines in the figure 2 cartoon representation of a ns interior . as the ns spins - up ( down ) they remain parallel as they move in ( out ) toward ( away from ) the ns spin axis to maintain the vortex line density of equation 1 .",
    "the required addition ( depletion ) in total number of vortex lines needed for this comes from the creation ( disappearance ) of zero length vortex lines at the spin - hemisphere equator of the crust - core interface . within the sc - p superconductor ( estimated to be `` type ii '' ) of the ns core magnetic field fragments into an extremely dense array of quantized flux - tubes ,",
    "each containing a magnetic flux @xmath6 g @xmath7",
    ". one such flux - tube , among the 10@xmath8 in the interior of a typical ns , is shown in the figure 2 cartoon . unlike their neutron vortex line counterparts flux tubes turn and twist , a relic of a young highly conducting ns s initially complicated toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields after its violent birth .",
    "the area density of the quantized flux - tubes    @xmath9    within the non - superconducting crust the flux tubes merge into a microscopically smooth b.    msps are generally believed to achieve their very high spin from a surrounding accretion disk fed by a companion ( still present around psr j0437 ) .",
    "as the ns spin - up begins and continues ( typically for longer than 10@xmath10 years ) the original sf - n vortex array moves inward toward the ns spin - axis .",
    "the inward moving vortices must either cut through the core s magnetic flux array in which they are embedded or else carry those flux - tubes inward with them .",
    "detailed calculations show that because of the sf - n - vortices very slow inward velocity during this long spin - up ( @xmath11 10@xmath12 cm s@xmath13 ) the inward moving sf - n vortex array enforces a similar inward co - motion of the much denser , more flexible and complicated , flux - tube array through which it passes ( ruderman et al 1998 ) .",
    "because of motion - induced flux - tube bunching , such forced flux - tube co - motion would be expected even if the inward velocity of the sf - n vortices were very much faster ( r 01 ) . [ in the much earlier spin - down era in the history of this ns , sf - n vortices moved outward from the ns spin - axis , carrying the core s flux tubes outward with them .",
    "there is strong supporting evidence for just such magnetic field evolution in much younger spinning - down radiopulsars ( r 01 ) ] .",
    "figure 3 shows the expected ns surface field evolution during spin - up for three prototype initial surface field configurations .",
    "( the very long time scale for spin - up to a msp greatly exceeds the several x10@xmath14 year eddy diffusion time through the thin stellar crust .",
    "therefore even if movement of an overstressed crust is neglected , crust conductivity is sufficient to insure that on long time scales the crust s surface field reflects that of the core surface a km . below it . ) in figure 3 s case ( b ) flux leaving the ns s upper spin - hemisphere returns to the star in that same hemisphere . in this case",
    "prolonged spin - up of the ns must result in a dipole moment orthogonal to the ns spin - axis , positioned on that axis where it meets the core s surface ( cf . also figure 4 ) .",
    "ns spin - up from an initial period @xmath15 to a final @xmath16 reduces the ns dipole moment by a factor @xmath17 .",
    "it is this diminishing dipole strength that allows accretion to achieve such very strong spin - up . in figure 3 s case ( a )",
    "all returning flux from the upper spin - hemisphere comes back to the stellar surface in its lower spin - hemisphere . from this initial configuration",
    "prolonged spin - up results in an aligned pulsar . here",
    ", however , there can only be an increase in the dipole moment component parallel to the spin .",
    "therefore such a ns could not be spun - up to a very small period msp unless its initial dipole moment was already less than 10@xmath18 g. the figure 3 case ( c ) ns is nearly that of case ( b ) . here , however , a small fraction of the flux out of the upper spin - hemisphere returns to the stellar surface in its lower hemisphere . during stellar spin - up",
    "the large orthogonal dipole component become much smaller as in case ( b ) , but the small aligned component is not similarly quenched . whether , after @xmath19 , the strongly quenched orthogonal moment or the initially much smaller but unquenched aligned one dominates depends on both the initial field distribution and on @xmath20 .",
    "however , when @xmath21 is achieved , high fractions of both orthogonal and aligned msps are expected .",
    "figure 4 shows details of final `` spin - up squeezed '' surface magnetic fields after ns spin - up to very short period msps .",
    "its left panel is that for the orthogonal dipole after the pre - spin - up field configuration of figure 3 ( b ) .",
    "agreement between the expected radioemission with this left panel distribution and radio observations of the msp orthogonal rotator psr 1937 has been considered in cr ( 93 ) .",
    "the `` spin - up squeezed '' structure of the surface magnetic field of an aligned pulsar is shown in the middle panel of figure 4 , and in more detail in the right panel of it . in such a msp the surface polar cap is only a short distance ( the crust thickness @xmath22 , about 1 km above a magnetic pole .",
    "one consequence is that the polar cap magnetic field is about @xmath23 times larger than it in conventional ns models with the same ns dipole moment at the center of the star or from a uniformly magnetized core ( crz 98 ) .",
    "however , the magnetic flux through the polar cap (= the magnetic flux through the pulsar s `` light cylinder '' ) remains the same .",
    "therefore , the polar cap radius of a strongly spun - up aligned msp ( psr j0437 has p=5.75  ms ) should be          in a very old msp which long ago stopped accreting the main source for continuing thermal x - ray emission is expected to be from heating of its polar caps by backflow onto them of extreme relativistic e@xmath26 or e@xmath27 .",
    "these come from separated e@xmath28 pairs made within or above an accelerator on the open field line bundle between the polar cap and a rapidly spinning aligned msp s light cylinder .",
    "the e@xmath26 or e@xmath27 will be funneled down along the open b - field lines onto the tiny radius @xmath29 polar cap .",
    "[ at the polar cap the energy of each such inflowing energetic lepton to the polar cap of psr j0437 ( initially acquired in the accelerator )   3 ergs , an energy not sensitive to assumptions about accelerator parameters ( wang et al 1998 ) .",
    "the associated power inflow onto a heated polar cap is more difficult to estimate because of uncertainty about the e@xmath26(e@xmath27 ) flow rate . ]    a second source of psr j0437 surface heating is the 10@xmath30 mev curvature radiation from its 3 erg leptons as they move down curved field lines toward the polar cap . as indicated in the right panel of figure 4 , when a strongly spun - up msp is an aligned rotator these b - field lines are so dominated by the nearby local pole as they approach the stellar surface that the guiding field lines become almost straight within a distance  r of the polar cap .",
    "the inflowing leptons curvature radiation then drops greatly when they enter that region .",
    "the curvature radiation heating of the aligned msp s surface , which can be comparable in magnitude to that from particle flow onto its squeezed polar cap , is therefore mainly onto a large annulus of inner radius      thus an aligned psr j3047 with the spin - up squeezed geometry of figure 4 should emit its hottest thermal radiation from a tiny hot polar cap with the radius @xmath29 of equation 3 and cooler thermal radiation from a much larger surrounding annulus with an inner radius the @xmath32 of equation 5 .    observed soft x - ray emission from psr j0437 fits a combination of a power law spectrum together with two black body components of almost equal luminosity ( zavlin et al 2002 , pavlov et al 2002 , b&a 02 ) .",
    "soft x - ray power law radiation is expected from the synchrotron emission by e@xmath33 pairs created by accelerator produced @xmath34-rays .",
    "the thermal components have been interpreted as emission from a hot polar cap with a radius @xmath35      these two radii are roughly those of equations 3 and 5 for the expected spin squeezed geometry ( right panel of figure 4 ) of an aligned psr j0437 . however , such agreement as support for this special b - field geometry is weakened because a broken power law fit to the whole soft x - ray spectrum has not been excluded . if the two black body spectra interpretation is confirmed it would be a crucial supplement to other evidence for the spin - dipole moment connection in ns evolution ( r 01 ) .",
