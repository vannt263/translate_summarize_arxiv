    "subsequently , an explicit update is performed , which is followed again by two implicit , unidirectional corrections .",
    "accordingly , the mcs scheme retains the well - known key advantage of adi schemes over standard implicit methods , such as the crank  nicolson scheme , that the ( linear or nonlinear ) systems to be solved in each time step are much easier to handle .",
