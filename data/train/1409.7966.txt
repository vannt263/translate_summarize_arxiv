    "the special focus on the many sources of uncertainty @xcite leads to a robust semantically - enhanced modelling architecture based on the paradigm of semantic array programming ( semap ) @xcite , with an emphasis on the array of input , intermediate and output data / parameters and the array of data - transformation modules ( d - tm ) dealing with them .",
    "arrays of hazard models @xmath6 , dynamic information forecasts @xmath7 ( i.e. meteorology ) and static parametrisation @xmath8 ( i.e. spatial distribution of land cover ) are considered .",
    "their multiplicity derives from the many sources on uncertainty @xmath9 which affect their estimation ( or implementation , for the d - tm software modules @xmath10 which are the building blocks of the hazard models @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , during emergency modelling support the lack of timely and accurate monitoring systems over large spatial extents ( e.g. at the continental scale ) may imply a noticeable level of uncertainty to affect possibly even the location of natural hazards ( _ geoparsing _ @xcite uncertainty ) .",
    "this peculiar information gap may be mitigated by integrating remote sensing ( e.g. satellite imagery ) with a distributed array of social contributors ( citizen sensor @xcite ) , exploiting mobile applications ( apps ) and online social networks @xcite .",
    "remote sensing and the citizen sensor are here designed to cooperate by complementing accurate ( but often less timely ) geospatial information with distributed alert notifications from citizens , which might be timely but not necessarily accurate .",
    "their safe integration implies the supervision of human expertise , even if the task may be supported by automatic tools @xcite .",

    "may easily lead to an exponential increase of the required computational processes ( the so called `` curse of dimensionality '' ) . a viable mitigation strategy might be offered by hpc tools ( such as urgent hpc @xcite ) in order to sample high - dimensional modelling space with a proper method .",

    "the transdisciplinary nature of complex natural hazards  their need for an unpredictably broad and multifaceted readiness to robust scalability  may benefit ( 1 ) from a disciplined _ abstract modularisation _ of the data - transformations which compose the models ( d - tm ) , and ( 2 ) from a _ semantically - enhanced _ design of the d - tm structure and interactions .",
    "these two aspects define the semantic array programming ( semap , @xcite ) paradigm whose application  extended to geospatial aspects @xcite  is proposed to consider also the array of uncertainties ( data , modelling , geoparsing , software uncertainty ) and the array of criteria to assess the potential impacts associated with the hazard scenarios .",

    "<S> demands on the disaster response capacity of the european union are likely to increase , as the impacts of disasters continue to grow both in size and frequency . </S>",

    "<S> europe experienced a series of particularly severe disasters in the recent years @xcite , with worrying potential impacts of similar disasters under future projected scenarios of economy , society and climate change @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they range from flash floods @xcite and severe storms in western europe with an expected increasing intensity trend @xcite , large - scale floods in central europe @xcite , volcanic ash clouds @xcite ( e.g. after the eyjafjallajkull eruption ) , large forest fires in portugal and mediterranean countries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> biological invasions such as emerging plant pests and diseases have the potential to further interact e.g. with wildfires @xcite and to impact on ecosystem services @xcite and economy with substantial uncertainties  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be underlined that these recent highlights are set in the context of systemic changes in key sectors @xcite which overall may be expected to at least persist in the next decades . as a general trend , </S>",
    "<S> demands on the eu s resilience in preparedness and disaster response capacity are likely to increase , as the impacts of disasters continue to grow both in size and frequency , even considering only the growing exposure ( societal factors ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aforementioned examples of disturbances are often characterised by non - local system feedbacks and off - site impacts which may connect multiple natural resources ( system of systems ) @xcite . in this particular multifaceted context @xcite , landscape @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> ecosystem dynamics show intense interactions with disturbances @xcite .    as a consequence , classical disciplinary and domain - specific approaches which might be perfectly suitable at local - scale </S>",
    "<S> may easily result in unacceptable simplifications within a broader context . </S>",
    "<S> a broad perspective is also vital for investigating future natural - hazard patterns at regional / continental scale and adapting preparedness planning @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity and uncertainty associated with these interactions  along with the severity and variety of the involved impacts @xcite  urge robust , holistic coordinated @xcite and transparent approaches @xcite . at the same time , the very complexity itself of the control - system problems involved @xcite may force the analysis to enter into the region of deep - uncertainty @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mathematization of systems in this context as a formal control problem should be able to establish an effective science - policy interface , which is _ not _ a trivial aspect . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily recognised even just considering the peculiarities  which have been well known for a long time  of geospatially - aware environmental data </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and decision support systems @xcite , their entanglement with growingly complex ict aspects @xcite and their not infrequent cross - sectoral characterisation . </S>",
    "<S> several pitfalls may degrade the real - world usefulness of the mathematization / implementation process . </S>",
    "<S> while it is relatively intuitive how a poor mathematization with a too simplistic approach might result in a failure , subtle pitfalls may lie even where an `` appropriately advanced '' theoretical approach is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> mathematization should resist _ silo thinking _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite temptations such as academic solution - driven pressures @xcite to force the problem into fashionable `` hot topics '' of control theory : robust approximations of the real - world broad complexity may serve egregiously instead of state - of - art solutions of oversimplified problems .    </S>",
    "<S> other long - lasting academic claims are `` towards '' fully automated scientific workflows in computational science , maybe including self - healing and self - adapting capabilities of the computational models implementing the mathematization . </S>",
    "<S> these kinds of claims might easily prompt some irony @xcite among experienced practitioners in wide - scale transdisciplinary modelling for environment ( wstme , @xcite ) as a never - ending research pandora s box with doubtful net advantages @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> complex , highly uncertain and sensitive problems for policy and society , as wstme problems typically are , will possibly never be suitable for full automation : even in this family of problems , `` humans will always be part of the computational process '' @xcite also for vital accountability aspects @xcite .    while a certain level of autonomic computing @xcite capabilities might be essential for the evolvability and robustness of wstme ( in particular , perhaps , a higher level of semantic awareness in computational models and a self - adapting ability to scale up to the multiple dimensions of the arrays of data / parameters ; see next section ) , here the potential pitfall is the illusion of _ fully automating _ wstme . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of applicability of this puristic academic _ silo _  although promising for relatively simple , well - defined ( and not too policy - sensitive ) case studies  might be intrinsically too narrow for climbing up to deal with the _ wicked problems _ typical of complex environmental systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussed pitfalls might deserve a brief summary . </S>",
    "<S> first , perhaps , is the risk of `` solving the wrong problem precisely '' @xcite by neglecting key sources of uncertainty  </S>",
    "<S> e.g. unsuitable to be modelled within the `` warmly supported '' solution of a given research group . during emergency operations , </S>",
    "<S> the risks of providing a `` myopic decision support '' should be emphasised ; i.e. suggesting inappropriate actions @xcite  e.g. inaction or missing precaution  due to the potential overwhelming lack of information @xcite or the oversimplification / underestimation of potential chains of impacts due to the lack of computational resources for a decent ( perhaps even qualitative and approximate ) rapid assessment of them .    </S>",
    "<S> overcoming these pitfalls is still an open issue . here </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to contribute to the debate by proposing the integrated use of some mitigation approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on some general aspects of the _ modelling architecture _ for the computational science support , in order for emergency - operators , decision - makers , stakeholders and citizens to be involved in a participatory @xcite information and decision support system which assimilates uncertainty and precaution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since no silver bullet seems to be available for mitigating the intrinsic wide - extent of complexity and uncertainty in environmental risk modelling , an array of approaches is integrated and the computational aspects are explicitly connected with the supervision and distributed interaction of human expertise . </S>",
    "<S> this follows the idea that the boundary between classical control - theory management strategies for natural resources and hazards ( driven by automatic control problem formulations  </S>",
    "<S> `` minimize the risk score function '' ) and scenario modelling under deep - uncertainty ( by e.g. merely supporting emergency - operators , decision - makers and risk - assessors with understandable information  `` sorry , no such thing as a risk score function can be precisely defined '' ) is fuzzy </S>",
    "<S> . both modelling and management aspects may be computationally intensive and their integration is a transdisciplinary problem ( _ integrated natural resources modelling and management _ , inrmm @xcite ) . </S>"
