    "the ternary rare - earth iron silicides , adopting a tetragonal p4/_mnc _ ( space group no .",
    "128 ) crystal structure , exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena . the majority of the @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 = rare - earth atoms ) series order antiferromagnetically with the magnetic moments originating only from the lanthanide atoms @xcite , except for paramagnetic superconductors with @xmath6 lu , y , and sc , reaching superconducting transition temperatures , t@xmath7 = 6.25 , 1.68 , and 4.46 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "a separation of superconducting and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases occurs in er@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 @xcite . in turn",
    ", tm@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 is a reentrant superconductor under pressure , in which the superconducting phase is destroyed at the nel temperature , t@xmath9 .",
    "the properties of this compound are significantly sensitive to any disorder @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 reveals a heavy - fermion ( hf ) state and kondo- lattice behaviour and an absence of superconductivity ( sc ) @xcite . any disorder or doping with magnetic impurites , containing f electrons , diminish sc also in lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the overall dependence of magnetic ordering temperatures among @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 systems @xcite suggests that the interplay between separated magnetic and superconducting phases is possible only for heavy lanthanides . in the rest of iron - based 235-type",
    "silicides magnetic interactions are too strong for an occurrence of sc .    the specific - heat jumps at t@xmath7 in ( lu;y;sc)@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 have been successfully described by the two - gap bcs - like model @xcite .",
    "the inter - band electron scattering between these two weak - coupled gaps opened on the whole fermi surface ( fs ) is the reason for an observed anisotropy of superconducting properties in the 235-type iron silicides being rather quasi-2d superconductors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the conventional ( phononic ) character of an sc mechanism in lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 has been questioned by a fast suppression of t@xmath7 caused by non - magnetic impurities and atomic disorder induced by the neutron irradiation @xcite .",
    "these effects might be explained by spin - fluctuation mediated scenario of sc , similarly to that postulated in iron ( oxy)pnictides .",
    "the two - gap sc with s@xmath10 symmetry is connected with a specific electronic structure , in particular with the fs topology .",
    "former theoretical studies predicted multiband fss of the 235-type iron superconductors , containing both electronlike and holelike pieces of different dimensionality and orbital character @xcite , in analogy to the most intensively investigated two - gap superconductor mgb@xmath8 @xcite . the differences in dimensionality of two fs sheets of this compound appeared to be crucial for its twoband sc phenomenon . in the ( lu;y;sc)@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 family",
    ", the larger gap may be connected with quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) parts of the holelike fs sheets , while the so - called passive band may contribute to the 3d electronlike fs sheet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in these superconductors , the orbital - dependent contributions of the fe 3d electrons to the fss are partially separated from one another @xcite .",
    "it enables the possibility of a similar sc mechanism to that in iron ( oxy)pnictides @xcite , however , of a much weaker character .    in this work ,",
    "the electronic structures of other ternary iron silicides ( tm;er;tb;yb)@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 are compared with that in lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , being a reference paramagnetic superconductor .",
    "a former study showed that the fe 3d electrons in this superconductor should play an important role in its sc phenomenon @xcite .",
    "however , the substitution of other lanthanide atoms for lu atomic positions leads to various effects : tm@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 and er@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 also exhibit sc , while tb@xmath8fe@xmath8si@xmath2 and yb@xmath8fe@xmath8si@xmath2 are non - superconducting , and in addition the latter is a hf system .",
    "our careful study of electronic structures of these rare - earth iron silicides may help in understanding a variety of physical phenomena exhibited by this family of compounds , especially the examination of their fss topology from the point of view of two - gap sc and density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( e@xmath5 ) .",
    "electronic structure calculations for the @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 = lu , tm , er , tb , yb ) intermetallics have been performed with the full - potential linearised augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method , implemented in the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "the perdew - wang @xcite form of the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) of an exchange - correlation functional was employed with including the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the lsda+@xmath4 approach @xcite was used for strongly correlated 4f electrons of yb , tm , er , and tb atoms . since a lack of appropriate experimental data for investigated here ternary iron silicides ,",
    "the value of the effective coulomb repulsion @xmath4 of 7 ev was chosen as an average value of those commonly used ( and also verified experimentally ) to description of the considered @xmath3-atoms in other compounds , studied in the literature - see e.g. refs .",
    "for investigated here 235-type compounds , the experimental values of the lattice parameters of the unit cells ( u.c . ) with the @xmath11 symmetry , and atomic positions in each u.c . have been taken from refs .",
    "@xcite . the valence basis cutoff was set to -8.0 ev for a better description of semicore states .",
    "furthermore , the value of r@xmath12k@xmath13 = 8.0 was selected for more accurate plane - wave basis set required by the 4f states coming from the lanthanide atoms .",
    "the total energy values were converged with accuracy to 1 mev for the 12@xmath1412@xmath1412 * k*-point mesh leading to 126 * k*-points in the irreducible part of brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the fermi surface calculations were carried out on more dense mesh of 765 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the bz .",
    "the dos plots of @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 = lu , tm , er , tb ) , calculated in either lsda ( for @xmath3 = lu ) or lsda+@xmath4 ( for the remaining @xmath15 atoms ) approaches , are presented in fig .",
    "it is seen in this figure that the metallic character of the 235-type compounds originates from the wide fe 3d electron peak centred at about 1.5 ev below e@xmath5 .",
    "the dos at the fermi level , n(e@xmath5 ) , appears to be completely dominated by this kind of electrons in the whole family of the 235-type systems , similarly to our former results for ( lu;y;sc)@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the si 3p electron orbitals hybridise with the fe 3d orbitals , predominantly in the energy range of 1 - 6 ev below e@xmath5 .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath3 4f electrons are localised at higher binding energy values than 6 ev . at the same time , there are also the 4f peaks located above e@xmath5 around 0.9 , 1.5 , and 2.75 ev for tm , er , and tb atoms , respectively .    the studied here 235-type compounds , except for non - magnetic lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , exhibit a strong magnetic ordering , due to their local 4f moments , coming from open 4f - electron shells of lanthanide atoms .",
    "however , their experimentally observed afm structures are quite complex @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , their non - collinear magnetism can not be investigated with the employed here software , thus the obtained values of the magnetic moments , corresponding to their hypothetical collinear arrangements , are not discussed here .",
    "the more so as the main aim of this work is the study of the fe 3d electrons , carrying negligible magnetic moments in these systems , but the most probably playing a crucial role in the sc phenomenon exhibited in some of these ternaries . as is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath3 4f electrons only insignificantly influence the dos at e@xmath5 .    in turn , for the yb - based compound , yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , both dos results ( lsda and lsda+@xmath4 ) are presented in fig .",
    "interestingly , in the standard lsda , the yb 4f peak is close to e@xmath5 , contrary to the lu 4f states that are predominantly localised at higher binding energies .",
    "it is known that the 4f - electron shells of free yb and lu atoms are completely filled , however , in yb compounds the 4f electrons may carry magnetic moments and be located close to e@xmath5 .",
    "since the hf behaviour of yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 can not be described adequately by the standard dft methods , we have applied both the lsda and lsda+@xmath4 approaches and compared their results in a similar way as it had been done for other heavy - fermion compounds , e.g. ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8 @xcite and ybsi @xcite .",
    "our results of the usage of @xmath4 = 7 ev yield a suppression of n(e@xmath5 ) from 10.0 to 5.6 electrons / ev / f.u . , which is comparable to other 235-type systems with n(e@xmath5 ) @xmath16 4 - 5 electrons / ev / f.u .",
    "the values of n(e@xmath5 ) for all studied here 235-type compounds , collected in table [ table1 ] , differ insignificantly from one another .",
    "our previous results for isoelectronic ( lu;y;sc)@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 showed nearly equal doss at e@xmath5 as well @xcite . also the doss in a small energy region around e@xmath5 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , are quite similar for almost all studied here compounds , except for the heavy - fermion yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 system .",
    "this finding suggests that superconducting properties of ternary iron silicides are rather not related to the doss themselves .",
    "the fermi surfaces of @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 = lu , tm , er , tb ) , computed within either lsda ( for @xmath3 = lu ) or lsda+@xmath4 ( for the other @xmath3 atoms ) approaches , are visualised in fig .",
    "it is seen that in these compounds , the fss reveal both holelike and electronlike character of the main three sheets ( denoted as i - iii ) like former results for @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 = lu , y , sc ) superconductors @xcite .",
    "interestingly , only holelike fs sheets i in tm- and er - based compounds distinctly differ as to both the shape and size from that in lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , while the two remaining holelike ii and electronlike iii sheets of all the considered above compounds are comparable to one another . at the same time , in non - superconducting tb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , the central close pocket of fs sheet ii is more cubic from that being rather cylindrical in the other considered here superconductors .",
    "furthermore , fs sheets i i ii of tb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 contain also some disconnected holelike pillows , centred at the corners of the bz boundaries , instead of large single pieces of reduced dimensionality , being open along the @xmath17 axis . in this aspect",
    ", the fs of tb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 resembles rather that reported for lu@xmath8ru@xmath1si@xmath2 @xcite .    in the iron - based 235-type compounds ,",
    "the fs shape and dimensionality is determined mainly by the fe 3d electrons . only in the heavy - fermion yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2",
    ", the influence of the yb 4f electrons on the fs can be significant .",
    "it turns out that the fs of this compound , displayed in figure [ fig5 ] , is completely different from those of the remaining studied here systems , depicted in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it is formed by two identical large holelike sheets , i and ii , possessing a typically metallic character , which are open along the @xmath17 and @xmath18 axes directions , and smaller electronlike sheets , iii and iv , in the form of a hourglass and tiny pockets , respectively .",
    "the dimensionality of active and passive superconducting bands for two - gap sc in 235-type fe - based systems , considered in experimental studies @xcite , remains still unclear .",
    "holelike bands are assumed to create the quasi-1d fs pieces , while the 3d electronlike pillows in sheet iii , possibly originate from the passive band .",
    "it should be mention here that the calculated fss may be sensitive to structural data .",
    "however , for large many - atom u.c.s of investigated here 235-type compounds , we had to assume only experimental values of all structural parameters , since predicted extremely high costs of their full theoretical optimisation exclude , in practice , a possibility of such calculations .",
    "therefore , the fss of these systems require further experimental examination by e.g. angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) to confirm the _ ab initio _ results .    in turn , the analogy between fss in superconducting lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 and mgb@xmath8 is quite interesting .",
    "the @xmath19 ( active ) and @xmath20 ( passive ) bands of mgb@xmath8 with a distinct orbital character yield also hole- and electronlike fs sheets , respectively @xcite . in lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ,",
    "holelike sheets are related to the fe 3d @xmath21 and @xmath22 states while the electronlike sheet is formed clearly by the fe 3d @xmath23 electrons ( see fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", the pronounced orbital character may be decisive for multiband sc , particularly in iron ( oxy)pnictides @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the suspected unconventional character of sc in lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 can be universal for all iron - based superconductors .",
    "electronic structures of ternary iron silicides , except for heavy - fermion yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , are quite similar , suggesting that their sc phenomenon is related to quite subtle electronic features or the suppression of superconducting phase is caused by an occurrence of a magnetic ordering , coming from lanthanide atoms .",
    "the disorder - sensitive sc of the 235-type fe - based superconductors , observed in previous experiments , suggests that further investigations on the influence of nonmagnetic impurities on the electronic structure of lu@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 might be helpful for better understanding of the sc phenomenon in the family of ternary iron silicides .",
    "the electronic structures of @xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 = lu , tm , er , tb , yb ) have been investigated from first principles .",
    "our results indicate that the studied here compounds , except for heavy fermion yb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 , have a very similar character of both densities of states and the fermi surfaces , in agreement with our former study on the ( lu;y;sc)@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 superconductors @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the 235-type iron - based compounds , the electronic structure around the fermi level is completely dominated by the fe 3d electrons .",
    "the suppression of superconductivity in tm@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 and er@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 and also its complete lack in tb@xmath8fe@xmath1si@xmath2 seem to be related rather to a presence of local magnetic moments than to subtle electronic structure differences , among which a disappearance of quasi-1d character of holelike pieces of fs sheets i and ii can also play some role . presented here results encourage to further investigations of the influence of nonmagnetic impurities on electronic structure of the 235-type superconductors that may improve an understanding of the multigap sc phenomenon in iron - based intermetallics .",
