    "under these two questionable assumptions , the dominant losses were of nonradiative character ( phonons , electrons , lattice defects and impurities ) , leading to comparable attenuations of the longitudinal and transverse modes , and similar propagation lengths as those found in ref .",

    "it was found @xcite that a nonmonotonic behavior in the dispersion relation of the transverse mode emerges due to retardation effects , unlike the case of the longitudinal mode .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior was argued to arise from the phase matching of the plasmon dispersion with free photons of the same frequency @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the electron energy loss spectroscopy technique was used to excite and map subradiant modes of short nanoparticle chains @xcite .    while the existence of collective plasmons in nanoparticle chains and the theoretical approaches predicting the resulting frequencies are well documented in the literature , the situation is more controversial when coming to the issue of the damping mechanisms , which are crucial for the excitation propagation and the practical application of these plasmonic waveguides . in this paper",
    "we investigate theoretically the problem of collective plasmonic excitations in chains of metallic nanoparticles , focusing on their damping mechanisms .",
    "we assume that the dipolar localized surface plasmons ( lsps ) supported by each spherical nanoparticle interact through their near field and hence form plasmonic modes which are delocalized over the whole chain , i.e. , collective plasmons .",
    "these collective excitations are coupled to both electron - hole and photonic environments , leading to the nonradiative landau damping and radiative decay of the plasmonic excitations .",
    "in addition , the collective plasmons are subject to nonradiative absorption ( ohmic ) losses .",
    "our open quantum system approach enables us to derive analytical expressions for the radiative damping rates of the transverse and longitudinal plasmonic modes in the infinite chain limit , confirming previous numerical studies .",
    "additionally , we provide analytical expressions of the landau damping decay rates , the latter being crucial for small nanoparticle sizes and/or for dark modes that couple only weakly to photons .",
    "our approach based on the collective plasmon reduced density matrix in momentum space allows us to study energy transport along the chain .",
    "importantly , we find that radiation damping is responsible for changing the character of the collective plasmon decay along the chain . while without radiation damping , the decay is exponential for all distances , the presence of radiation damping induces algebraic tails at long distances .",
    "such behavior is crucial for the appropriate characterization of the damping in the propagation of an initially localized excitation .",
    "notably , we demonstrate that the short distance exponential decay , which is the most relevant in the prospect of light and energy transport at the nanoscale , is of purely _ nonradiative _ origin .",
    "we further show that the size - dependent landau damping is crucial in understanding the limiting mechanisms to plasmon propagation , especially for small nanoparticles .",

    "[ fig : propagation](e ) and [ fig : propagation](f ) and from eq .",
    "is that the longitudinal mode generally propagates for a longer distance than the transverse one , thus confirming previous numerical studies @xcite in the framework of a well - defined criterion .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lsps have an effective interaction strength in eq .   which is twice as much in the longitudinal case ( @xmath207 ) than in the transverse case ( @xmath208 ) .",

    "as can be seen on the figure , the initial excitation propagates for at least @xmath219 nanoparticles in the case of the longitudinal mode , corresponding to a distance of about @xmath220{nm}$ ] .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] for @xmath216 to @xmath221 that the transverse mode ( cf .  red dashed lines in the figure ) has a longer lifetime than the longitudinal one ( blue solid lines ) .",
    "such a longer lifetime is associated with lower propagation efficiency .",
    "hence , the longitudinal mode propagates for longer distances than the transverse mode .",
    "for instance on the 8@xmath222 nanoparticle , the longitudinal mode is still active ( at the level of a few percent of the initial excitation ) while the transverse one is totally suppressed .",
    "one may conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] that , although the signal is strongly damped , it may still be detectable and therefore be useful in the prospect of information transfer based on nanoscale plasmonic metamaterials .",
    "we have considered collective plasmonic excitations in finite and infinite chains of spherical metallic nanoparticles , and in particular their damping . our open quantum system approach has enabled us to quantify the two most important size - dependent damping mechanisms that lead to the decay of the plasmonic excitations along the chain : the landau damping due to the coupling to internal electronic degrees of freedom and radiation damping due to the coupling to the surrounding electromagnetic field modes .",
    "we have derived and presented a universal analytical formula for the nonradiative landau damping decay rate of the coupled plasmonic modes that is valid for arbitrary chain length .",
    "we have shown that landau damping is predominant for small nanoparticles as it scales as the inverse of their diameter . moreover , unlike radiative losses , landau damping is finite for all plasmon modes of any wavelength .",
    "we have calculated the radiation damping decay rate of the coupled modes and obtained an analytical expression for the infinite chain limit .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations for finite chains , thereby extending the investigated parameter regime and confirming the analytically predicted behavior for infinite chains .",
    "our transparent analytical results , obtained within a quasistatic approximation , are also consistent with existing numerical results which include retardation effects .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that retardation effects do not play a crucial role and are rather unimportant for explaining , at least qualitatively , radiation losses in coupled plasmonic nanostructures .    using the reduced density matrix formalism",
    ", we have investigated the decay of the plasmonic excitation along the chain when a long - wavelength laser field illuminates the first nanoparticle of the chain . in the case of a continuous drive by a monochromatic field",
    ", we have numerically demonstrated that there are two distinct regimes for the decay of the plasmonic modes along the chain . for short distances ( typically of the order of @xmath223 nanoparticles ) , the decay of the plasmonic excitation exhibits an exponential behavior along the chain .",
    "importantly , we have shown that such an exponential decay is due solely to the nonradiative damping mechanisms ( i.e. , ohmic losses and landau damping ) and that it is not influenced by radiation damping . for longer distances ,",
    "the decay becomes algebraic , with a polarization - dependent power - law .",
    "such an algebraic decay is exclusively due to the behavior of the radiation damping decay rate as a function of momentum .",
    "this regime switching is of foremost importance for characterizing the alteration of an excitation along the chain , and must be taken into account when comparing the different predictions and measurements of the decay lengths .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn from the case of a pulsed excitation on the first nanoparticle .",
    "we have provided transparent and simple analytical expressions for the exponentially - decaying plasmon excitation profile along the chain and its associated plasmon propagation length , which is larger for the longitudinal mode than for the two transverse modes .",
    "the largest propagation lengths were found at the limit of validity of the present model .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to develop alternative models in order to extend the parameter range explored in this work .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to extend the theory of the decay of coupled plasmonic modes presented in this paper , which captures the essential physics of the problem , to other one- and two - dimensional arrays of metallic nanoparticles , presenting , e.g. , interesting topological features , such as the honeycomb array baring chiral bosonic dirac plasmons @xcite .",
