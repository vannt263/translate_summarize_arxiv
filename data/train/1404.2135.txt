    "the presence of the pseudospin degree of freedom and the associated berry phase in graphene calls for a further refinement of this essentially classical argument.@xcite the berry phase is responsible for a quantization of the kinematic angular momenta @xmath0 to half - integer values , which excludes the presence of a zero - angular momentum state , that would correspond to strict normal incidence in the klein tunneling picture . as a result , _",
