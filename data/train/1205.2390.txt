    "multi - valued quantum computing is gaining importance in the field of quantum information theory and quantum cryptography as it can represent an _",
    "n_-dimensional quantum system , defined by the basis states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... ,",
    "@xmath3 . the unit of information",
    "is called a qudit .",
    "a qudit exists as a linear superposition of states , and is characterized by a wave function @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "multi - valued quantum algebra comprises the rules for a set of basic logic operations that can be performed on qudits . while in @xcite the structure of a multi - valued logic gate",
    "is proposed which can be experimentally feasible with a linear ion trap scheme for quantum computing , this approach produces large dimensional circuits . a universal architecture for multi - valued reversible logic is given in @xcite , but quantum realization of the circuits thus obtained is not apparent .",
    "the universality of @xmath0-qudit gates is presented in @xcite , but no algorithms for synthesis were given .",
    "al - rabedi proposed in @xcite the minimization technique for multi - valued quantum galois field sum of product .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the quantum ternary functions .",
    "a ternary quantum system exists in linear superposition of three basis states , labeled @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "all the operations on a qutrit are developed in a 3-dimensional hilbert space under the field gf(3 ) @xcite .",
    "a two qutrit vector can be represented as @xmath6 = @xmath7 = 1 . in general",
    ", a @xmath0 qutrit state can be represented as a superposition of @xmath8 basis states .",
    "a quantum register of size @xmath0 qutrits can hold @xmath8 values simultaneously , whereas the @xmath0-qubit register in binary quantum domain can hold @xmath9 values . for the same size of memory , a quantum fourier transform ( qft ) with ternary qutrits improves the approximation and increases the state space by a factor of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this is very useful in cryptography .",
    "the realization of ternary operations requires a set of universal gates with which a quantum circuit for a given ternary quantum function can be built .",
    "one set of universal gates @xcite comprise the ternary swap , the ternary not and the ternary toffoli gate . with these universal gates",
    ", any arbitrary quantum circuit can be realized without ancilla bits , but this approach is not optimal in terms of quantum cost @xcite .",
    "further , the synthesis method in @xcite uses quantum multiplexers and the method of iterative deepening depth first search is employed to minimize the gate cost .",
    "another synthesis technique was proposed in @xcite for garbage free gf(3 ) based reversible or quantum logic circuit from its truth values , using only muthukrishnan - stroud ( m - s ) [ 3 ] and shift gates @xcite . but this technique did not provide any simplification rule to reduce the gate count . in paper @xcite the ternary quantum logic was expressed in terms of ternary galois field sum of product , and 16 ternary galois field expansions were also proposed . but this paper did not provide any gate level implementation of ternary benchmark circuit .",
    "the paper here is the extended version of @xcite , where our motivation is to synthesis a given quantum ternary benchmark @xcite function specified as ternary minterms , using projection operations .",
    "further we realize the gate level implementation of these benchmark @xcite circuits using generalized ternary gates @xcite and newly defined _ permutative _ ternary quantum c@xmath11not gates .",
    "a few simplification rules are enumerated for reducing the number of ancilla qutrits and the levels of gates in the resulting quantum circuit .",
    "the preliminary concepts of ternary algebra with a new projection operation appear in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the characteristics of basic ternary logic gates and the generalized ternary gate ( gtg ) @xcite along with the introduction of a few new gates are discussed .",
    "the proposed synthesis methodology along with a set of simplification rules is presented in section 4 .",
    "synthesis of quantum ternary benchmark circuits by this method , and the respective quantum gate cost with ancilla qutrit count are given in section 5 .",
    "concluding remarks appear in section 6 .",
    "we first define the basic operations over the set \\{0 , 1 , 2}.      the operations of and , or , and not @xcite for ternary variables are : + @xmath12 @xmath13 + @xmath14 . + here",
    "@xmath15 denotes the modulo 3 addition .",
    "it is easy to see that the ternary @xmath16 operation is distributive over the @xmath17 operation and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to define a given ternary function in terms of the minterms corresponding to its @xmath20 or @xmath21 values .",
    "the @xmath8 minterms for a function @xmath22 with @xmath0 ternary variables are denoted by @xmath23 to @xmath24 . in the sum of products form of minterms , the minterm @xmath23 = @xmath25 where @xmath26 = \\{@xmath27 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 } and @xmath28 denotes the ternary @xmath16 ; its value is 1 , 2 , or 0 depending on whether for all _ i _ @xmath29 = 0 , 1 or 2 respectively .    as the outcomes of a ternary function may be @xmath27 , @xmath20 or @xmath21",
    ", we can not express a ternary function @xmath22 which results in either @xmath20 or @xmath21 for a given set of inputs , by using the above minterms @xmath30 .",
    "so , we present six projection operations , grouped into two types @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath31 = \\{@xmath27 , @xmath20 , @xmath21}. while the @xmath19 type operation was defined earlier @xcite as    @xmath32 + the @xmath18 types are newly defined here as    @xmath33 + their truth tables appear in table 1 . from table 1",
    ", we can verify that the output of any @xmath18 operation is either @xmath27 or @xmath20 , and that of @xmath19 operation is either @xmath27 or @xmath21 .",
    "two other derived operations @xmath34 , @xmath35 as shown in the table 2 .",
    "next , we express a ternary function as a sum of products minterm form by using the @xmath18 and @xmath19 operations .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 operations are commutative , associative and distributive over ternary and and or logic .",
    "we can verify these laws given below , from table 1 . here",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 = \\{0 , 1 , 2 } + 1 .",
    "commutativity +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a methodology for logic synthesis of ternary quantum circuits .",
    "we have defined a minterm based approach of expressing a ternary logic function by using @xmath18 and @xmath19 operations .",
    "we have also stated the simplification rules for the proposed method . by applying these simplification rules",
    ", we can realize the ancilla free @xmath38 function . among the ternary benchmark circuits @xcite , the quantum gate cost for the group of addition and multiplication functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , by our method is smaller compared to that by the earlier method in @xcite .",
