    "the majority of sfgs follow a relatively tight , almost linear relation between sfr and stellar mass , usually referred to as the star - formation `` main sequence '' that seems to be in place since @xmath14 ( sf - ms ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ubiquitous and tight sf - ms suggests that the majority of the stars are formed in a predominantly smooth , _ secular _ mode .",
    "furthermore , there is also evidence that , despite their wide range of sizes and morphologies , most of the stars in sfgs are formed in disks which are growing from the inside out , thus increasing their sizes with cosmic time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the progressive structural growth in the sf - ms is consistent with the classic notion of galaxy formation in a @xmath15cdm universe in which gas accreted from dark matter halos cools and forms new stars in disks with increasingly larger scale lengths with cosmic time ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a challenge to this simplified picture",
    "are the small sizes ( @xmath16  kpc ) of the first massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . on one hand",
    ", their small sizes might be the consequence of having smaller star - forming progenitors formed at earlier times when the universe was more dense ( i.e. , more concentrated haloes and higher gas fractions ) .",
    "on the other hand , compact quiescent galaxies could form in strongly dissipative processes , triggered by mergers or interaction - driven disk instabilities that cause a substantial growth of the nuclear stellar density as a result of gas - rich starbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both scenarios imply the formation of compact sfgs as the last stage before quenching star formation , but the predictions differ on whether these compact sfgs would exhibit extended sfr profiles , driving the inside - out size growth , or compact star - forming regions ( starbursts ) triggered by the dissipative phase .",
    "such compact sfgs have been identified in sizable numbers and their small stellar sizes , steep mass profiles and obscured sfr properties have been confirmed by multiple studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , direct measurements of their spatial distribution of the star formation relative to the mass profile , needed to discriminate between the two formation scenarios discussed above , are still inconclusive .",
    "these measurements have proven very difficult because even spatially resolved uv and optical sfr indicators based on hst observations are significantly affected by the high dust obscuration , particularly in galaxy centers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and fir observations , sensitive to ionizing radiation re - emitted by the dust , usually have very poor spatial resolution .",
    "modern ( sub-)millimeter / radio interferometers such as alma and jvla have opened a new window into this regime and enable us to measure the dust emission with high sensitivity and similar spatial resolution as those from hst observations .    here , we exploit a joint analysis of the high spatial resolution hst / acs and wfc3 and alma continuum imaging to simultaneously characterize the uv- and ir- sfr profiles and the stellar mass profiles of 6 compact sfgs at @xmath1 . throughout this paper",
    ", we quote magnitudes in the ab system , assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , and adopt the following cosmological parameters : ( @xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.7 ) .",

    "the compact sfgs were identified following the method described in @xcite .",

    "the mean radius containing 95% of the light from the observed fir profiles is @xmath78 smaller than that of the optical profile .",
    "the deconvolved , fir profiles are also more compact than the optical in 5/6 galaxies .",
    "the exception is gds-3280 , which has the smallest optical size and a high @xmath75 , while the morphology in alma exhibits some slight asymmetries .",
    "the ratio of the mean effective radii is @xmath79 . despite being more compact ,",
    "the fir profiles have , on average , lower ( disk - like ) srsic indices with @xmath80 than the optical profiles with @xmath81 .",
    "figure  4a compares the fir and optical @xmath77 ans shows no clear correlation .",
    "furthermore , the fir sizes exhibit a tighter size distribution , that suggests a relatively homogeneous population of compact , dusty , starbursts confined to the nuclear regions . the small star - forming regions with integrated sfrs consistent with the sf - ms imply that the nuclear starbursts have @xmath82 up to @xmath83 larger than a typical sf - ms disk with @xmath84  kpc @xcite .",
    "the remarkable compactness of the dust continuum emission is consistent with recent results on smgs and other ir - bright galaxies which report small fir sizes ( gaussian fhwm  @xmath85 ) compared to the typical rest - frame optical sizes of sfgs at @xmath86 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . nonetheless , joint studies of both the uv- and ir- sfrs , and the stellar mass profiles are required to fully constrain the regions where stars are being formed and to understand their role in the structural evolution of sfgs .      figure  4b shows the average stellar mass and sfr profiles of the compact sfgs as computed from their deconvolved , surface density profiles .",
    "the uv - sfr and ir - sfr profiles are determined by scaling the rest - frame luminosity profiles , probed by acs / f850lp and alma  870  @xmath0 m , to an integrated sfr using the conversion in equation  [ sfrform ] .",
    "the stellar mass profiles are determined from the rest - frame optical luminosity probed by wfc3/f160w ( approximately g - band , @xmath87 ) by using an empirical correlation between the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath88 , and the rest - frame @xmath89 color as determined from f125w and f160w ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we account for resolution effects in the color profile by using the best - fit galfit models of the f125w and f160w brightness profiles .",
    "the average ( uv+ir ) sfr profile is approximately @xmath90 more concentrated than the average stellar mass profile and it is strongly dominated by the ir emission ( uv / ir  @xmath91 ) up to @xmath9  kpc .",
    "the specific sfr ( ssfr  @xmath92  sfr / m ) is highest at @xmath93  kpc and thus imply that most of the stellar mass growth is taking place within the inner few kpc of the galaxy . at @xmath94  kpc ,",
    "the ssfr is @xmath12100@xmath10 lower thus indicating that the sfr has an almost negligible contribution to the stellar mass growth at large radii .",
    "note that the uv- and ir- sfr profiles are detected only up to @xmath95  kpc ( @xmath96  kpc@xmath97 and @xmath98  kpc@xmath97 ) .",
    "therefore , the results at larger radii are based on the best - fit srsic profiles .",
    "nonetheless , we verify that even if the ir - sfr profiles had secondary components undetected by alma with @xmath9910@xmath10 and 100@xmath10 lower than the detection limit ( orange lines in figure  [ stack]b ) , the @xmath77 would only increase by @xmath125% and 20% and thus the sfr would still be more concentrated than the stellar mass .",
    "in a simplified picture of galaxy growth , the average structural evolution of sfgs proceeds roughly along their well - defined scaling relations ( blue arrows in figure  [ evoltracks ] ; e.g. , @xcite ; barro et al .",
    "2016b ) . in this picture , massive compact quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 would be descendants of smaller sfgs at higher - z that achieve such high stellar densities by continuously growing in stellar mass and size fueled by extended sfr profiles .",
    "alternatively , these sfgs could deviate from the smooth track due to dissipative processes that would rapidly increase their concentrations and potentially decrease their half - mass radii in strong nuclear starbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ secular _ and dissipation - driven scenarios are not mutually exclusive .",
    "however , we aim to understand whether the massive dense cores of compact quiescent galaxies are primarily formed in dissipative processes .",
    "the strong nuclear starbursts embedded in larger stellar mass profiles found in compact sfgs are indeed an excellent match to the dissipation - driven scenario .",
    "the light - to - dark green lines and circles in figure  [ evoltracks ] show the predicted change in the stellar mass profile and the evolutionary tracks in @xmath77 and central mass density for compact sfgs due to star formation , assuming that their sfr profiles remain constant during @xmath100  myr ( approximately @xmath101 ) . the significant stellar mass growth within the inner @xmath102  kpc decreases the half - mass radius by @xmath103 from @xmath104 to @xmath105  kpc , while the central density within @xmath106  kpc increases by @xmath78 from log(@xmath107 )  @xmath92  9.7 to 10.3  m@xmath5  kpc@xmath97 .",
    "if compact sfgs had more extended star formation at @xmath108  kpc the evolution of @xmath107  would be the same , while @xmath109 would decrease less ( e.g. , @xmath127% for the magenta line ) .",
    "these evolutionary tracks are very similar to the predictions of the vela simulations during the `` wet compaction '' phase ( black arrows ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and contrast with the expected evolution for typical sf - ms galaxies , which have extended sfr profiles with @xmath110 lower central @xmath111 ( cyan line in figure  [ evoltracks]a ) and thus favor a more gradual increase of @xmath107  and a positive size evolution .",
    "the short depletion times of compact sfgs and the similarity with the mean stellar mass profile of quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 ( red dashed line in figure  5a ) suggest that the nuclear starburst is unlikely to continue for more than a few hundred myrs , either because no further gas is accreted into the galaxy center or because the dense stellar component stabilizes the gas to prevent further star formation and eventually leads to galaxy quenching .",
    "this scenario is consistent with previous results indicating that the formation of a dense core precedes the shut down of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and suggests that , at high redshift , both quenching and the dense cores are simultaneous consequences of enhanced periods of nuclear star formation that cause a rapid depletion of the gas reservoirs .",
