    "some elm white dwarfs are paired with a neutron star companion , e.g. , the pulsar j1012 + 5307 @xcite , implicating a range of initial secondary masses extending to @xmath9@xmath1 .    we have identified @xmath10 bright hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars in a joint _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) ultraviolet ( uv ) survey and guide star catalogue ( gsc ) survey ( paper i : * ? ? ?",

    "we present photometric and spectroscopic observations ( section 2 ) , and a model atmosphere and periodogram analysis showing galex  j1717 + 6757 to be a new elm white dwarf in a close binary and we analyze its photometric properties ( section 3 ) . in section 4 , we estimate the distance , kinematics , and age of the system and discuss some implications for close binary evolutionary scenarios .",
    "we observed galex  j1717 + 6757 on ut 2011 january 28 using the ritchey - chrtien focus spectrograph ( rc - spec ) attached to the 4-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",

    "we obtained a total of 65 exposures of 480 to 600 s each , spanning nearly 6  h of hour angle and covering all phases of the orbit , and measured radial velocities of the h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 lines using a convolution algorithm @xcite .",
    "we also obtained eight velocities using the same setup 2011 june 21 through 25 to further constrain the ephemeris ( section 3.2 ) .",

    "the data were corrected for second - order extinction effects by fitting a line to the differential magnitude versus air - mass diagram and subsequently removing the linear dependence .",
    "each time series provided approximately 5 hours of continuous coverage in the three photometric bands .",
