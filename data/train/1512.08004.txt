    "de sitter metric , with the same structure at @xmath16 .    in the statement of theorem  [ thmintromain ] ,",
    "we point out that the amount of regularity of the remainder term @xmath34 at the cauchy horizon is directly linked to the amount @xmath51 of exponential decay of @xmath34 : the more decay , the higher the regularity .",
    "this can intuitively be understood in terms of the _ blue - shift effect _",
    "@xcite : the more a priori decay @xmath34 has along the cauchy horizon ( approaching @xmath19 ) , the less energy can accumulate at the horizon . the precise microlocal statement capturing",
    "this is a _ radial point estimate _ at the intersection of @xmath16 with the boundary at infinity of a compactification of the spacetime at @xmath52 , which we will discuss in  [ subsecintrogeometry ] .",
    "now , @xmath51 can be any real number less than the _ spectral gap _",
    "@xmath53 of the operator @xmath54 , which is the infimum of @xmath55 over all non - zero _ resonances _ ( or quasi - normal modes ) @xmath56 ; the resonance at @xmath57 gives rise to the constant @xmath40 term .",
    "( we refer to @xcite and @xcite for the discussion of resonances for black hole spacetimes . ) due to the presence of a trapped region in the black hole spacetimes considered here , @xmath53 is bounded from above by a quantity @xmath58 associated with the null - geodesic dynamics near the trapped set , as proved by dyatlov @xcite in the present context following breakthrough work by wunsch and zworski @xcite , and by nonnenmacher and zworski @xcite : below ( resp .  above )",
    "any line @xmath59 , @xmath60 , there are infinitely ( resp .",
    "finitely ) many resonances . in principle",
    "however , one expects that there indeed exists a non - zero number of resonances above this line , and correspondingly the expansion can be refined to take these into account .",
    "( in fact , one can obtain a full resonance expansion due to the complete integrability of the null - geodesic flow near the trapped set , see @xcite . )",
    "since for the mode solution corresponding to a resonance at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , we obtain the regularity @xmath63 at @xmath16 , shallow resonances , i.e.  those with small @xmath64 , give the dominant contribution to the solution @xmath12 both in terms of decay and regularity at @xmath16 .",
    "the authors are not aware of any rigorous results on shallow resonances , so we shall only discuss this briefly in remark  [ rmkrndshighreg ] , taking into account insights from numerical results : these suggest the existence of resonant states with imaginary parts roughly equal to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and hence the relative sizes of the surface gravities play a crucial role in determining the regularity at @xmath16 .",
    "whether resonant states are in fact no better than @xmath67 , and the existence of shallow resonances , which , if true , would yield a linear instability result for cosmological black hole spacetimes with cauchy horizons analogous to @xcite , will be studied in future work .",
    "once these questions have been addressed , one can conclude that the lack of , say , @xmath68 regularity at @xmath16 is caused precisely by shallow quasinormal modes .",
    "thus , somewhat surprisingly , the mechanism for the linear instability of the cauchy horizon of _ cosmological _ spacetimes is more subtle than for asymptotically flat spacetimes in that the presence of a cosmological horizon , which ultimately allows for a resonance expansion of linear waves @xmath12 , leads to a much more precise structure of @xmath12 at @xmath16 , with the regularity of @xmath12 directly tied to quasinormal modes of the black hole exterior .",
    "the interest in understanding the behavior of waves near the cauchy horizon has its roots in penrose s strong cosmic censorship conjecture , which asserts that maximally globally hyperbolic developments for the einstein ",
    "maxwell or einstein vacuum equations ( depending on whether one considers charged or uncharged solutions ) with _ generic _ initial data ( and a complete initial surface , and/or under further conditions ) are inextendible as suitably regular lorentzian manifolds . in particular , the smooth , even analytic , extendability of the reissner  nordstrm(de sitter ) and kerr(de sitter ) solutions past their cauchy horizons is conjectured to be an unstable phenomenon .",
    "it turns out that the question what should be meant by ` suitable regularity ' is very subtle ; we refer to works by christodoulou @xcite , dafermos @xcite , and costa , giro , natrio and silva @xcite in the spherically symmetric setting for positive and negative results for various notions of regularity .",
    "there is also work in progress by dafermos and luk on the @xmath48 stability of the kerr cauchy horizon , assuming a quantitative version of the non - linear stability of the exterior region .",
    "we refer to these works , as well as to the excellent introductions of @xcite , for a discussion of heuristic arguments and numerical experiments which sparked this line of investigation .    here ,",
    "however , we only consider linear equations , motivated by similar studies in the asymptotically flat case by dafermos @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote  11 ) ) , franzen @xcite , sbierski @xcite , and luk and oh @xcite .",
    "the main insight of the present paper is that a uniform analysis up to @xmath16 can be achieved using by now standard methods of scattering theory and geometric microlocal analysis , in the spirit of recent works by vasy @xcite , baskin , vasy and wunsch @xcite and @xcite : the core of the precise estimates of theorem  [ thmintromain ] are microlocal propagation results at ( generalized ) radial sets , as we will discuss in  [ subsecintrostrategy ] . from this geometric microlocal perspective however ,",
    "i.e.  taking into account merely the phase space properties of the operator @xmath54 , it is both unnatural and technically inconvenient to view the cauchy horizon as a boundary ; after all , the metric @xmath3 is a non - degenerate lorentzian metric up to @xmath16 and beyond .",
    "thus , the most subtle step in our analysis is the formulation of a suitable extended problem ( in a neighborhood of @xmath69 ) which reduces to the equation of interest , namely the wave equation , in @xmath32 .",
    "the penrose diagram is rather singular at future timelike infinity @xmath19 , yet all relevant phenomena , in particular trapping and red-/blue - shift effects , should be thought of as taking place there , as we will see shortly ; therefore , we work instead with a compactification of the region of interest , the domain of dependence of @xmath14 in figure  [ figintropenrose ] , in which the horizons as well as the trapped region remain separated , and the metric remains smooth , as @xmath70 . concretely , using the coordinate @xmath10 employed in theorem  [ thmintromain ] , the radial variable @xmath5 and the spherical variable @xmath71 , we consider a region @xmath72 i.e.  we add the ideal boundary at future infinity , @xmath73 , to the spacetime , and equip @xmath74 with the obvious smooth structure in which @xmath75 vanishes simply and non - degenerately at @xmath76 .",
    "( it is tempting , and useful for purposes of intuition , to think of @xmath74 as being a submanifold of the blow - up of the compactification suggested by the penrose diagram  adding an ` ideal sphere at infinity ' at @xmath19  at @xmath19 .",
    "however , the details are somewhat subtle ; see @xcite . )    due to the stationary nature of the metric @xmath3 , the ( null-)geodesic flow should be studied in a version of phase space which has a built - in uniformity as @xmath70 .",
    "a clean way of describing this uses the language of b - geometry ( and b - analysis ) ; we refer the reader to melrose @xcite for a detailed introduction , and @xcite and @xcite for brief overviews .",
    "we recall the most important features here : on @xmath74 , the metric @xmath3 is a non - degenerate lorentzian _",
    "b - metric _ , i.e.  a linear combination with smooth ( on @xmath74 ) coefficients of @xmath77 where @xmath78 are coordinates in @xmath79 ; in fact the coefficients are independent of @xmath75 . then , @xmath3 is a section of the symmetric second tensor power of a natural vector bundle on @xmath74 , the _ b - cotangent bundle _ @xmath80 , which is spanned by the sections @xmath81 .",
    "we stress that @xmath82 is a smooth , non - degenerate section of @xmath80 _ up to and including _ the boundary @xmath73 .",
    "likewise , the dual metric @xmath83 is a section of the second symmetric tensor power of the _ b - tangent bundle _ @xmath84 , which is the dual bundle of @xmath80 and thus spanned by @xmath85 . the dual metric function , which we also denote by @xmath86 by a slight abuse of notation , associates to @xmath87 the squared length @xmath88 .    over @xmath89 ,",
    "the b - cotangent bundle is naturally isomorphic to the standard cotangent bundle .",
    "the geodesic flow , lifted to the cotangent bundle , is generated by the hamilton vector field @xmath90 , which extends to a smooth vector field @xmath91 tangent to @xmath92 .",
    "now , @xmath93 is homogeneous of degree @xmath94 with respect to dilations in the fiber , and it is often convenient to rescale it by multiplication with a homogeneous degree @xmath95 function @xmath96 , obtaining the homogeneous degree @xmath97 vector field @xmath98 . as such , it extends smoothly to a vector field on the _ radial ( or projective ) compactification _",

    "the projection to the base @xmath74 of integral curves of @xmath93 or @xmath105 with null initial direction , i.e.  starting at a point in @xmath106 , yields ( reparameterizations of ) null - geodesics on @xmath107 ; this is clear in the interior of @xmath74 , and the important observation is that this gives a well - defined notion of null - geodesics , or null - bicharacteristics , at the boundary at infinity , @xmath79 .",
    "we remark that the characteristic set @xmath108 has two components , the union of the future null cones @xmath109 and of the past null cones @xmath110 .",

    "a natural idea then is to simply add a boundary @xmath129 , @xmath130 , which one could use to cap the problem off beyond @xmath16 ; now @xmath131 is _ timelike _ , hence , to obtain a well - posed problem , one needs to impose boundary conditions there . while perfectly feasible , the resulting analysis is technically rather involved as it necessitates studying the reflection of singularities at @xmath131 quantitatively in a uniform manner as @xmath132 .",
    "( near @xmath131 , one does not need the precise , microlocal , control as in @xcite however . )",
    "a technically much easier modification involves the use of a complex absorbing ` potential ' @xmath133 in the spirit of @xcite ; here @xmath133 is a second order b - pseudodifferential operator on @xmath74 which is elliptic in a large subset of @xmath134 near @xmath73 .",

    "however , since we are forced to work on a domain with boundary in order to study the forward problem , the _ pseudodifferential _ complex absorption does not make sense near the relevant boundary component , which is the extension of the left boundary in figure  [ figintropenrose ] past @xmath6 .",
    "a doubling construction as in @xcite on the other hand , doubling the spacetime across the timelike surface @xmath131 , say , amounts to gluing an ` artificial exterior region ' to our spacetime , with one of the horizons identified with the original cauchy horizon ; this in particular creates another trapped region , which we can however easily hide using a complex absorbing potential !",
