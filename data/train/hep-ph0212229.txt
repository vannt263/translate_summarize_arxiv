    "recently , experiment e821 at brookhaven national laboratory achieved an order of magnitude improvement ( relative to the classic cern experiments ) in the determination of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath3 .",
    "the new world - average value for that fundamental quantity is  @xcite @xmath4 additional data currently being analyzed should further reduce the uncertainty .    at the present level of precision , comparison with the theoretical prediction for @xmath5 from the standard model",
    "requires knowledge of hadronic vacuum polarization effects with accuracy of one percent .",
    "the most recent dispersion integral analysis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) based on data from electron - positron annihilation into hadrons and hadronic @xmath6 decays demonstrates that the issue is unsettled : @xmath7 annihilation leads to a prediction lower by about @xmath8 than the value ( [ e821 ] ) while the prediction based on @xmath6 data is lower only by @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the vector spectral functions derived from @xmath7 annihilation and from @xmath6 decays differ significantly for energies beyond the @xmath10 resonance peak ( by more than 10% in some regions ) .",
    "it seems very difficult to explain such a large difference by isospin breaking effects .",
    "thus , it appears that the data from @xmath7 annihilation and from @xmath6 decays are incompatible : so , no conclusion can be derived yet about a deviation from the standard model prediction .",
    "since a real deviation from theory would signal the presence of `` new physics '' , with supersymmetry the leading candidate , it is extremely important that all such hadronic uncertainties be thoroughly scrutinized and eliminated as much as possible before implications are drawn . toward that end , new @xmath7 and @xmath6 data from frascati and the @xmath11 factories",
    "will hopefully help to resolve this puzzling difference .    beyond the leading hadronic vacuum polarization effects ,",
    "strong interaction uncertainties also enter @xmath5 via higher orders that involve quark loops .",
    "quark loops appear in light - by - light scattering contributing in three loops as well as in two - loop electroweak corrections .",
    "the latter are the subject of this paper although the hadronic uncertainties there are certainly much smaller than those induced by light - by - light scattering .    at the two loop electroweak level ,",
    "hadronic uncertainties arise from two types of diagrams , quark triangle diagrams related to the anomaly and hadronic photon-@xmath12 mixing .",
    "the first category has been previously studied in a free quark approximation and the more general operator product expansion .",
    "although phenomenologically both approaches produce very close numbers they differ : particularly with regard to their explicit short distance dependence , i.e.  @xmath13 terms . here , we show that this difference is due to an incomplete operator product analysis in the second approach . when corrected , unambiguous short - distance contributions result .",
    "we also take this opportunity to update the long distance and total electroweak contributions .    in the case of photon-@xmath12 mixing , its two loop contribution to @xmath5 is suppressed by a factor @xmath14 ; so , it is not as important . it can be evaluated either in the free quark approximation ( sufficient for logarithmic accuracy ) or via a dispersion relation using data from @xmath7 annihilation into hadrons .",
    "the difference is shown to be numerically insignificant .",
    "finally , having clarified the leading short - distance behavior of the two loop electroweak radiative corrections to @xmath5 , we can use the renormalization group to estimate higher order leading - log contributions which , due to an interesting cancellation , turn out to be very small .    in the end ,",
    "our analysis leads to a new , not very different , but more precise and better founded prediction for the electroweak contributions to @xmath5 .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) the one - loop electroweak contributions to @xmath5 , illustrated in fig.[fig : oneloop ] , were computed about 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "they have the relatively simple form @xmath16   \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the fermi constant obtained from the muon lifetime and @xmath18 is the weak mixing angle .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the calculations are relatively straightforward : the diagram fig.[fig:4ferm12](b ) produces no logs in the landau gauge and can be omitted , the diagram fig.[fig:4ferm34](a ) reduces to fig.[fig:4ferm34](b ) by means of the fierz transformations ( [ fierz ] ) .",
    "the result for nonvanishing entries in @xmath19 is @xmath20 \\gamma^{{a ; fg } } _ { { v;f'g'}}&=&-6q_fq_g \\ , \\delta ^f_{f ' } \\delta ^g_{g ' } \\,,\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] \\gamma^{{v ; fg } } _ { { v;f'g'}}&= & -\\frac{2}{3}\\left [ n_fq_fq_{f'}\\delta ^{g}_{g ' } + n_f q_fq_{g'}\\delta ^{g}_{f ' } + n_gq_gq_{g'}\\delta ^{f}_{f'}\\right .",

    "in this case the effective lagrangian ( [ lw ] ) at @xmath22 contains only quark operators .",
    "they do not mix directly with @xmath23 so the second term in ( [ 3loop ] ) does not contribute . in the last term it is the mixing of quark operators with @xmath24 which provides a nonvanishing contribution .",
    "another contribution comes from the first term in ( [ 3loop ] ) , associated with the anomalous dimension of @xmath23 .",
    "using the initial data ( [ initw ] ) for @xmath25 after some simple algebra we arrive at @xmath26 & & + \\frac{\\alpha^2 } { \\pi^2}\\left\\ { \\frac{10}{3}\\left[8\\ln^2\\frac{m_w}{m_\\mu } - \\!\\sum_{f } b_f l_f(m = m_w ) \\right ] \\!-\\frac{32}{81}\\,\\ln\\frac{m_w}{m_q}\\ln\\frac{m_w}{m_c } -\\frac{32}{81}\\,\\ln^2\\frac{m_w}{m_q }   \\right\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced @xmath27 as an effective ir cutoff for the light quark loops , @xmath28 , implying @xmath27 is larger then @xmath29 . and",

    "that difference has no numerical impact .",

    "it is dominated by the the anomalous dimension term @xmath37 ( the first number 352 in @xmath38 term ) and by the cross term @xmath39 between the anomalous dimension and running of @xmath40 ( the number 359 ) , the four - fermion operators contribute very little , ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "moreover , the effect of the third loop becomes even smaller if we use @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 in the second loop : this changes the @xmath44 term in the third loop , @xmath45 .    finally , we note that if we shift to the usual fine structure constant , @xmath46 , via the full leading log relation @xmath47 it generates from the @xmath48 terms in eqs .",

    "( [ eq106 ] ) .",
    "so , in terms of the expansion parameter @xmath40 , the leading log three - loop corrections are essentially zero .",
    "such a complete cancellation appears to be a numerical coincidence .",
    "the algebra is more tedious in the case of the @xmath12 exchange .",
    "we set @xmath50 which is a very good approximation numerically .",
    "it simplifies the analytic result due to vanishing of the leptonic vector couplings @xmath51 at this value of @xmath52 , leaving us with fewer operators .",

    "@xcite we see that our @xmath71 coincides with their @xmath11 but the sum @xmath72 is somewhat different from @xmath73 in @xcite .",
    "this is due to a few reasons .",
    "one was already discussed : in eq.(23 ) of @xcite for the two - loop mixing of the operators @xmath74 with @xmath23 the factor @xmath75 should be changed to @xmath76 . in addition , there is a difference in the one - loop anomalous dimensions of four - fermion operators . in @xcite an extra factor 2 is ascribed to the penguin diagrams in fig.[fig:4ferm34 ] . to correct this the factor @xmath77",
    "should be introduced in eqs.(33 ) , ( 36 ) , ( 3841 ) of @xcite and in eq.(35 ) the @xmath78 should be changed to @xmath79 .",
    "numerically , @xmath80 where we used the same values for the quark masses as above .",
    "altogether , the three - loop correction is @xmath81 where it is implied that @xmath42 is used for the two - loop part .",
    "the numerical value is close to that given in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this final agreement is that the @xmath73-part of the three - loop result is numerically dominated by @xmath82 and large mixing of axial operators with the dipole operator , followed by the running of the dipole .",
    "these pieces , as well as the @xmath11-part , are correct in @xcite . if @xmath83 is used in the two - loop part the third loop is somewhat larger , @xmath84 .",
    "of course , in both cases one must reevaluate @xmath67(2-loop ) with the shifted coupling at scale @xmath85 or @xmath54 . in that way",
    ", scale insensitivity is restored .",
    "in addition , because the effective couplings are larger than the usual fine structure constant , @xmath40 , a transition to this @xmath40 in the two - loop part of @xmath67 induces additional negative contributions . remarkably , those negative contributions cancel with the above explicit three - loop results to about @xmath86 .",
    "( the cancellation is similar and of course related to the even more complete cancellation pointed out for the @xmath21 contribution alone . ) hence , to a good approximation , the leading - log higher order contribution is zero or at least negligible .",
    "having addressed a variety of computational issues ,    * small , previously neglected , 2-loop contributions suppressed by factors of @xmath87 that come from @xmath88-@xmath12 mixing and the renormalization of @xmath18 , * strong interaction modifications of quark loop diagrams , and * leading log 3-loop effects ,      small effects due to @xmath88-@xmath12 mixing and our choice of @xmath18 renormalization have now been included in eqs.([eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) . because of the @xmath87 suppression factor , their total impact is rather small , shifting the value of @xmath67 down by about @xmath89 .",
    "more important are strong interaction effects on the quark triangle diagrams in fig.[fig : triangle ] , particularly in the case of light quarks .",
    "it was shown that short distance contributions are unmodified ( thereby , hopefully , eliminating controversy in the literature ) .",
    "however , qcd can affect their long - distance properties . in the case of the first generation of fermions a detailed operator product expansion analysis and effective field theory calculation led to a shift relative to the free quark calculation ( with constituent quark mass ) by @xmath90_{\\rm qcd}-\\delta a_\\mu^{\\rm    ew}[e , u , d]_{\\rm free~quarks } = + 1.7\\times 10^{-11}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the second generation , comparison of the free quark calculation with the more precise evaluation in eq.([secgenn ] ) shows no significant numerical difference .",
    "however , the more refined analysis now indicates very little theoretical uncertainty .",
    "so , the total hadronic uncertainties in @xmath67 would seem to be well covered by an uncertainty of @xmath91 or even less .    finally , after a detailed renormalization group analysis , the leading log three - loop contributions turned out to be extremely small .",
    "in fact , they are consistent with zero , to our level of accuracy @xmath92 , due to a remarkable cancellation between anomalous dimensions and running coupling effects . uncalculated three - loop nll contributions are expected to be of order @xmath93 which is negligible unless enhanced by an enormous factor .",
    "nevertheless , we assign an overall uncertainty of @xmath94 to @xmath67 for uncalculated three - loop nll contributions .",
    "so , in total we find a small shift in @xmath67 ( for @xmath95 gev ) from the previously quoted value of @xmath96 to a slightly larger ( but consistent ) value @xmath97 where the first error corresponds to hadronic loop uncertainties and the second to an allowed higgs mass range of 114 gev @xmath98 250 gev , the current top mass uncertainty and unknown three - loop effects .",
