    "the submillimeter array ( sma ) is a joint venture of the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics ( asiaa ) .",
    "the interferometer has been under construction since the early 1990s .",
    "first fringes at 230  ghz were initially obtained with a single baseline at haystack observatory in october 1998 .",
    "this milestone was repeated on mauna kea in late september 1999 .",
    "all eight 6-meter antennas will be commissioned by the fall of 2003 .",
    "the surface of the primary reflector is composed of aluminum panels with a carbon fiber backup structure .",
    "there are 24 antenna pads arranged into four tangential rings approximating reuleaux triangles with a maximum baseline of 508  m. the cryostat can accomodate up to eight sis receiver inserts , which provides the capability to eventually cover the entire range from 175 to 950 ghz that is accessible from the ground .",
    "further description of the sma antennas , receivers , and if / lo systems can now be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "getting the array operating successfully in the 650  ghz band was a high initial priority for the sma in order to enable observations at frequencies substantially higher than any of the existing millimeter interferometers .",
    "a theoretical plot of the opacity in this band in good conditions is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "for some actual measurements with a fourier transform spectrometer , see @xcite .    on july 20 , 2002 , we saw first fringes on venus with a single 16  m ne / sw baseline at 672/682  ghz . although the data were acquired during the late afternoon and early evening ( usually the worst part of the diurnal weather pattern on mauna kea ) the rms phase noise was only @xmath2 after removing a fit to the residual error in the baseline length ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "several other strong dust continuum sources were detected during the night of july 20th , including iras  1629a , g10.62@xmath30.38 , and g34.26 + 0.14 ( fig  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "by late summer , we had three antennas ( numbers 4 , 5 , and 6 ) working in the 650  ghz band , in a configuration with with baseline lengths up to 25.2  m. a 682.5  ghz beacon for holography had been installed on the exterior of the nearby subaru telescope @xcite , and the first phase closure tests were performed on september 20th using this signal ( fig  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the first convincing three baseline detections on a celestial source were obtained two days later , with the array re - tuned to place the @xmath0co(6 - 5 ) line in the usb .",
    "the zenith opacity in this frequency band was approximately 1.2 which causes a large elevation dependence in the system temperature ( fig  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the phase closure on uranus was noisy , but the value averaged to the expected result of zero .",
    "saturn was easily detected on all baselines , but since it was highly resolved , the closure phase was not constant .",
    "strong @xmath0co(6 - 5 ) emission was detected strongly in the orion bn / kl hot core ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "a convincing closure phase was also seen in the continuum on callisto ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "one of the biggest problems for interferometric imaging in the 650  ghz band is the lack of strong point sources usable for the derivation of the complex gain as a function of time .",
    "nearly all of the quasars used at millimeter wavelengths will be too weak for use as calibrators .",
    "compact thermal sources such as small planets , planetary moons and asteroids will have to be used instead . as a star towards doing this , we took advantage of the close proximity of jupiter to the evolved star irc+10@xmath4216 last year . while jupiter itself was far too large ,",
    "the galilean moons were only slightly resolved . on december 8th",
    ", we were able to detect ( fig  [ fig9 ] ) make a calibrated image of cs(14 - 13 ) at 685  ghz in irc+10@xmath4216 using mars for passband calibration and callisto as a complex gain calibrator ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "cs(14 - 13 ) has a high critical density ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) and was expected to be unresolved on our current short baselines .    on december 12th",
    ", we tuned down to 658  ghz , and made the first interferometric observations of the strong vibrationally - excited water line there @xcite .",
    "the line was detected in vy  cma , u  ori and w  hya ( fig .  [ fig11 ] ) ."
