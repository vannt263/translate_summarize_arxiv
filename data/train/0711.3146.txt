    "( [ chi ] ) we have assumed that the active quantum well is located at the antinode of the cavity mode field , providing maximum coupling . note that here we have neglected the anti - resonant terms of the light - matter interaction and therefore we can describe the strong coupling regime for the electrically excited system , but not the ultrastrong coupling limit , as instead done in refs . .",
    "the hamiltonian term @xmath23 is meant to include all the other interactions : ( i ) electron - phonon interaction ; ( ii ) electron - electron interaction ; ( iii ) electron tunneling coupling to the injection and extraction reservoir ; ( iv ) coupling between the cavity photon field and the extracavity field .",
    "it is known that due to the cubic light - matter coupling term in the hamiltonian ( the product of two fermion operators and one boson operator ) it is not possible to write down an exact closed set of equations for the evolution of operators , being the heisenberg equation of motion for each product of @xmath24 operators coupled at least with one product of @xmath25 operators . in other words ,",

    "note that the role of coulomb electron - electron interaction on intersubband transitions has been studied , e.g. , in ref . .",
    "in the case of subbands with parallel parabolic dispersion ( e.g. , same effective mass ) , coulomb interaction produces a moderate renormalization of the intersubband transition frequency @xmath40 and of its oscillator strength , which will not be accounted explicitly in the present work .",

    "this is valid in the weak light - matter coupling regime or when the injector miniband energy width is broad enough . for large values of the vacuum rabi frequency ,",

    ". this coupling would involve correlations between the quantum well electronic field and the contact electronic fields . since in this paper",

    "note that here the electroluminescence spectral shape does not depend explicitly on the spectral properties of the injector and extractor reservoirs .",
    "the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ el ] ) has the same shape as the absorption ( in presence of the same carrier densities ) .",
    "the dependence on the transport is only implicit , being given by the steady - state carrier and photon populations .",
    "in contrast , in the exact solution of the the simplified model of ref . , it is shown that the electroluminescence spectra is the absorption spectrum times the spectral distribution of excitations in the electronic reservoir , which then acts as an electronic filter@xcite . a fermionic approach based on an exact diagonalization method",
    "@xcite indeed shows that the spectral properties of the electronic contact modifies significantly the spectral shape of the electroluminescence in the case of narrow band injectors .",

    "<S> we present a quantum theoretical analysis of the electroluminescence from an intersubband transition of a quantum well structure embedded in a planar microcavity . by using a cluster factorization method , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived a closed set of dynamical equations for the quantum well carrier and cavity photon occupation numbers , the correlation between the cavity field and the intersubband polarization , as well as polarization - polarization contributions . in order to model the electrical excitation , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered electron population tunneling from an injector and into an extractor contact . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rates have been obtained by considering the bare electronic states in the quantum well and the limit of validity of this approximation ( broad - band injection ) are discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the present quantum model to provide a comprehensive description of the electronic transport and optical properties of an intersubband microcavity light emitting diode , accounting for non - radiative carrier relaxation and pauli blocking . </S>",
    "<S> we study the enhancement of the electroluminescence quantum efficiency passing from the weak to the strong polariton coupling regime and compare it with the free - space case .    in the last two decades , the fundamental research on the physics of intersubband transitions in semiconductor quantum wells has enjoyed a considerable success and also led to novel applications in quantum optoelectronics@xcite . recently , </S>",
    "<S> reflectivity experiments @xcite have demonstrated that by embedding a doped quantum well structure in a planar microcavity , it is possible to achieve the strong coupling regime between an intersubband transition and a cavity photon mode , provided that a dense enough two - dimensional electron gas populates the fundamental quantum well subband . the interaction between a bright intersubband excitation and a cavity photon is quantified by the so - called vacuum rabi frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling regime occurs when the vacuum rabi frequency exceeds the electronic and photonic losses . </S>",
    "<S> in such a regime , the normal modes of the system are cavity polaritons , half - photon half - intersubband excitations . in this kind of system </S>",
    "<S> , it is even possible to reach an unconventional ultra - strong coupling regime , i.e. a vacuum rabi frequency comparable to the intersubband transition frequency@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between judiciously quantum engineered intersubband transitions and vertical electron transport is the essence of the so - called quantum cascade electroluminescent devices and lasers , which are unipolar optoelectronic sources emitting in the mid and far infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a new kind of microcavity - embedded quantum cascade devices in the strong coupling regime was proposed in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the first experimental demonstrations of a microcavity quantum cascade photovoltaic detector@xcite and of an electroluminescent device in the strong coupling regime have been recently reported@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this promising research topic is in its very infancy and many interesting theoretical questions need to be addressed . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , intersubband polariton electroluminescence has been analytically treated within a simplified hamiltonian model based on the following assumptions : ( i ) only the bright intersubband excitations have been taken into account , while dark excitations have been neglected ; ( ii ) only the low excitation regime has been considered , in which the bright intersubband excitations have been approximated as bosons ; ( iii ) the electronic coupling to the intersubband polarization field has been modeled through a phenomenological reservoir of bosonic excitations . in this work , we will attempt to treat the same problem starting directly from the fermionic hamiltonian for the quantum well carriers . this approach can give us useful insight to understand the physics obtained by relaxing the assumptions used in ref . and to grasp which intrinsic factors ultimately determine the quantum efficiency of these strong coupling emitters . on one hand , the large values of the vacuum rabi frequency could induce a very fast and efficient emission of photons . on the other hand , the large density of dark intersubband excitations created by the injection current and the pauli blocking in the densely populated fundamental subband could suppress such enhancement .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to point out that from a theoretical point of view , a description of the considered system in terms of the fermionic carrier operators makes the system hilbert space much larger than within a bosonic model . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we have followed an approach based on a truncation of the infinite hierarchy of dynamical equations for the operator expectation values , allowing us to describe many relevant aspects of the intersubband microcavity electroluminescence . </S>",
    "<S> however , some of the non - perturbative features obtained analytically within a bosonic model@xcite can not be accounted for within the present treatment . </S>",
    "<S> different fermionic approaches based on exact diagonalization methods @xcite are eventually necessary for further refinements .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a quantum model of the spontaneous photon emission from an electrically - excited intersubband transition of a quantum well structure embedded in a planar microcavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> here , we will consider the case of an incoherent electron transport , where the quantum well electron populations in the two subbands have a tunneling coupling to an electronic injector and to an extractor . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rates have been obtained by considering the bare electron states inside the quantum well . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of validity of this approximation will be discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the present theoretical model is applied to describe the incoherent electron transport and electroluminescence of an intersubband microcavity light emitting diode in the strong coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is structured as follows . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ ham ] , we describe the system and introduce the second quantization hamiltonian describing electrons in the two conduction subbands and photons in the fundamental microcavity mode . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ onetime ] , we present a closed set of dynamical equations for the one - time expectation values of operator products , describing photon and carrier populations as well as intersubband polarization - polarization and polarization - field correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these equations have been obtained through a cluster expansion , whose details are reported in appendix [ app ] . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ steady ] , we discuss the steady - state regime obtained under constant electrical excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding set of algebraic equations for the steady - state expectation values are reported in appendix [ algebraic ] . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra ] , the electroluminescence spectra are analytically calculated as a function of the populations and the appearance of intersubband cavity polaritonic resonances in the emission spectra is shown . </S>",
