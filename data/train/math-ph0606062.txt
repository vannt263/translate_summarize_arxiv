    "about seventy ears ago , fock in his paper @xcite demonstrated that the wave functions of the hydrogen atom in momentum representation are proportional to the four - dimensional hyperspherical harmonics ( hsh ) . from the point of view of the group theory , it means that the hydrogen wave functions possess the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the source of this remarkable property of the quantum two - body coulomb problem lies in the presence in of an additional conserving vector quantity  the laplace - runge - lenz operator .",
    "the applications of the fock s method to various problems of quantum mechanics are very extensive .",
    "lieber used it to calculate the lamb shift in the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "group - theoretical properties of @xmath0 symmetry of the hydrogen atom have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "schwinger @xcite showed that the hydrogen green function can be presented in a simple form as the series of four - dimensional hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "fock s method has been used for the calculation of the retardation effects in two - photon bound - bound transitions @xcite .",
    "the four - dimensional hsh can be chosen as a sturmian basis set in the many - center coulomb problem @xcite .",
    "recently , the fock s projection method has been applied to the theory of anisotropic excitons , see @xcite .    as was pointed by lieber @xcite ,",
    "the main difficulty in applying fock s symmetry to the specific problems is the dependence of the arguments of hsh on the energy .",
    "this prohibits the direct application of the wigner - eckart theorem to the calculation of matrix elements between different states of the two - body coulomb system .",
    "often , this problem can be avoided by using the above mentioned set of sturmian functions .",
    "those functions ( denoted sometimes as `` sturmians '' ) have the same form as the bound - state wave functions of the hydrogen atom whose arguments are chosen to be equal .",
    "thus , it is possible to apply the technique of the angular momentum theory to the calculation of integrals involving sturmian functions which belong to the same set @xcite .",
    "if one needs to calculate integrals between sturmians from different sets , there appears the same problem as in the calculation of integrals involving hydrogen wave functions with different energies .",
    "namely , the wigner - eckart theorem can be applied only for integrals containing hsh whose arguments correspond to the same point on the hypersphere .",
    "however , hydrogen wave functions with _ different _ energies ( or sturmians from different sets ) correspond to _ different _ points on the hypersphere . in this paper",
    "we show that this problem can be solved using the multipole expansion theorems for four - dimensional hsh .",
    "mathematically , we have derived the connection between sets of hsh corresponding to different stereographic projections .",
    "that is , hsh depending on some point of the hypersphere can be presented as a series of hsh depending on some other point which corresponds to the different stereographic projection of the three - dimensional space onto the four - dimensional hypersphere .",
    "the coefficients in those expansions are , in fact , the form - factors of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the form factor integrals are also known as `` generalized oscillator strengths '' ( gos ) .",
    "gos play an important role in the theory of collisions of fast particles with atoms and molecules .",
    "starting from the pioneering work by bethe @xcite , there is a large number of papers addressing the properties of gos of the hydrogen atom ( see review @xcite ) . in the book @xcite the compact expressions for gos corresponding to the transitions from @xmath3 and @xmath4 to @xmath5 states",
    "are given .",
    "the hydrogenic form - factors for transitions between arbitrary bound states were presented in @xcite in terms of combinations of hypergeometric functions of two variables .",
    "the integrals between the hydrogen wave functions and the operator of the electromagnetic interaction have been calculated in @xcite using the set of parabolic coordinates .",
    "the expressions for the bound - free matrix elements for the hydrogen atom may be found , e.g.  in @xcite . in all above",
    "works the calculations have been performed by means of straightforward evaluation of the three - dimensional integrals in spherical or parabolic coordinates .    below",
    "we demonstrate that the hydrogen form - factor integrals can be explicitly calculated _ without _ evaluating any integrals .",
    "our approach is based solely on the addition theorems for four - dimensional hsh which have been derived using the differential technique @xcite . as a result",
    ", we can write the hydrogen form - factor integrals as a combination of multipole terms ( they are equivalent to the radial integrals ) .",
    "each multipole term can be presented in a compact closed form containing derivatives of a some elementary function .",
    "this differential representation is very convenient for analyzing various properties of the integrals such as their asymptotic behavior .",
    "moreover , using the differential representations we have derived a number of recursion relations connecting radial integrals corresponding to different values of their indices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec  [ sec : ster - proj ] we consider the connection between matrix elements in coordinate and momentum representations as well as the general properties of the stereographic projection .",

    "the dependence of @xmath23 on the principal quantum number @xmath1 explains why the orthogonality relations can not be directly applied to the calculation of matrix elements .",
