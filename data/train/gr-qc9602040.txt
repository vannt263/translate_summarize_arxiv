    "dilaton models in 1 + 1 dimensions have been studied extensively in their string theory inspired form @xcite , as well as in generalized versions @xcite .",
    "recently also models with torsion @xcite which can be motivated as gauge theories for the zweibein have been seen @xcite to be locally equivalent to generalized dilaton theories , although the global properties differ in a characteristic manner .",
    "the prime motivation for investigating such models and especially the ordinary dilaton black hole ( dbh ) , always has been the hope to obtain information concerning problems of the genuine schwarzschild black hole ( sbh ) in d = 4 general relativity : the quantum creation of the sbh and its eventual evanescence because of hawking radiation and the correlated difficulty of information loss by the transformation of pure quantum states into mixed ones , black hole thermodynamics etc . @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "essential differences between dbh and sbh have been known for a long time .",
    "we just quote the hawking temperature ( @xmath0 ) and specific heat : for the dbh @xmath0 only depends on the cosmological constant instead of a dependence on the mass parameter as in the sbh .",
    "the specific heat is positive for dbh and negative for the sbh .    a basis for any application of dbh must be a comparison of its singular behavior with the one of the sbh .",
    "however , careful studies of the singularity structure in such theories seem to be scarce . apart from @xcite and our recent work @xcite we are not aware of such a comparison",
    ". it always seems to have been assumed that the physical features coincide at least qualitatively in all respects . during our recent work @xcite",
    "we noted that this is not the case : _ for the ordinary dilaton black hole of @xcite null extremals are complete at the singularity_. of course , non  null extremals are incomplete , and so at least that property holds for the dbh , but , from a physical point of view , it seems a strange situation that massive test bodies fall into that singularity at a finite proper time whereas it needs an infinite value of the affine parameter of the null extremal ( describing the influx e.g. of massless particles ) to arrive .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the genuine sbh serious doubts may be raised against any effort to extract theoretical insight from the usual dbh . in section 2",
    "we exhibit the main differences in the presumably most direct manner , namely by treating the dbh as well as the sbh as special cases of a general power behavior of the metric in kruskal coordinates .",
    "we find that the dbh lies at a point _ just outside _ the end of the interval of the bh - s which are qualitatively equal to the sbh in the sense that _ both _",
    "null and non  null extremals are incomplete . in order to pave the way for a more realistic modelling of the sbh we then ( section 3 ) consider a two parameter family of generalized dilaton theories which interpolates between the dbh and other models ,",
    "several of whom have been already suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "the eddington ",
    "finkelstein ( ef ) form of the line element , appearing naturally in 2d models when they are expressed as poisson ",
    "sigma models ( psm ) @xcite is very helpful in this context .",
    "we indeed find large ranges of parameters for which possibly more satisfactory bh models in @xmath1 may be obtained .",
    "consider a metric expressed in kruskal coordinates _ u , v _",
    "@xmath2    where we assume the metric to be dependent only on the product @xmath3 and a simple leading power behavior of @xmath4 near @xmath5 without loss of generality we consider the space - time where @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the case @xmath8 corresponds to flat minkowskian space - time and is not considered in the following .",
    "this metric covers many interesting cases . for the dbh we have @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xcite . neglecting the angular dependence the sbh metric has also this form with @xmath11 .",
    "this can be extracted easily from the formulas on p. 152 and 153 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "from the only nonvanishing components of the affine connection @xmath12 the curvature scalar becomes at @xmath13 with ( [ ds ] )    @xmath14 { \\stackrel{z \\to 0}{\\longrightarrow } 2az^{a-2}}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath15 ( de sitter behavior ) represents the border between singular ( @xmath16 ) and vanishing ( @xmath17 ) curvature at this point .",
    "both sbh and dbh belong to the singular range . with ( [ umin ] )",
    "the geodesic equations are simply    @xmath18    @xmath19    where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the canonical parameter @xmath20 the analysis of these equations greatly simplifies by noting that the metric ( [ ds ] ) admits a killing vector @xmath21 , for arbitrary @xmath22 , @xmath23 which implies the integral @xmath24 in the relation between the canonical parameter and the line element @xmath25 the constant @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 describe timelike , null and spacelike extremals , respectively .",
    "the sign of @xmath29 is arbitrary .",
    "expressing @xmath30 and @xmath31 from ( [ gl7])and ( [ a2 ] ) in @xmath32 yields near the singularity @xmath33 the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath35 is determined by @xmath36 this follows from ( [ gl7 ] ) replacing the @xmath37-dependence by a @xmath35-dependence according to ( [ zdot ] ) .",
    "the simple analysis of equation ( [ zdot ] ) shows that for @xmath38 the curvature singularity can be reached at finite affine parameter @xmath37 only by timelike and null extremals , whereas for @xmath39 this holds for all types of extremals .",
    "the difference between the asymptotic behavior of null ( @xmath27 ) and non - null ( @xmath40 ) extremals is especially transparent from ( [ zdot ] ) . for null extremals which cross the singularity ( @xmath41 )",
    "it takes the form @xmath42 so null extremals are incomplete ( finite value of the canonical parameter ) at the singularity if and only if @xmath43 . at the same time for timelike extremals and @xmath44 equation ( [ zdot ] )",
    "yields @xmath45 we see that timelike extremals are incomplete if @xmath38 . if @xmath39 then the asymptotic behavior of timelike and spacelike extremals near the singularity coincides with that of null extremals , ( [ ecapag ] ) , and they are always incomplete .",
    "thus we have proved that non - null extremals are always incomplete at the curvature singularity , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "null extremals are incomplete only for @xmath43 .",
    "so the dbh lies precisely at the border , @xmath10 , where null extremals are still complete at the singularity .",
    "this is a qualitative difference with the sbh at which all types of extremals are incomplete .    in order to be able to compare the family of dilaton theories considered in section 3 below",
    ", we also give the transformation of ( 1 ) into the ef metric @xmath48    which explicitly depends on the norm @xmath49 of the killing vector @xmath50 .",
    "introducing @xmath51 the necessary diffeomorphism is ( @xmath52 in order to cover the whole original range of @xmath53 )    @xmath54    with @xmath55 determined from    @xmath56    so that in ( [ ds2 ] ) @xmath57    for the power behavior ( [ ds ] ) we obtain @xmath58 to be taken at @xmath59 for @xmath60 and at @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the dbh case @xmath63 must be treated separately .",
    "the result    @xmath64    as expected , agrees with the familiar dbh behavior @xcite @xcite .",
    "( [ ds2 ] ) is particularly convenient to make contact with the psm formulation which can be obtained for all covariant 2d theories @xcite .",
    "they may be summarized in a first order action    @xmath65    in our present case only vanishing torsion    @xmath66    as implied by ( [ lagr ] ) is expressed in terms of light  cone ( lc ) components for the zweibein one form @xmath67 and for the spin connection one form @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the potential v is an arbitrary function of @xmath71 and determines the dynamics .",
    "it is simply related to the killing norm @xmath72 in the ef gauge because ( [ lagr ] ) can be solved exactly for any integrable @xmath73 ( cf . the first ref . in @xcite ) with the solutions ( constant curvature is excluded )    @xmath74    where @xmath22 and @xmath71 are arbitrary functions of the coordinates such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 is an arbitrary nonzero function .",
    "a similar solution for @xmath77 will not be needed in the following .",
    "the line element immediately yields the ef form ( [ ds2 ] ) with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the killing norm    @xmath80\\ ] ]    follows from a conservation law @xmath81 common to all 2d covariant theories @xcite @xcite @xcite which is related to a global nonlinear symmetry @xcite .",
    "the usual dilaton models are produced by the introduction of the dilaton field @xmath82 in @xmath83 , together with a weyl transformation @xmath84 of @xmath85 in ( [ lagr ] )    @xmath86    with the components @xmath87 expressed by the vanishing of the torsion ( [ tors ] ) in terms of the zweibein .",
    "the result @xmath88 will be used in the below and in the next section .    from the preceeding argument",
    "there is now a direct relation between the singularity in terms of kruskal coordinates ( [ ds ] ) through ( [ l2 ] ) to the singularity in the corresponding action ( [ lagr ] ) using ( [ kill ] )    @xmath89    with the singularity at @xmath90 for @xmath91 and at @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the exponential behavior of @xmath73 for the dbh ( @xmath94 ) may be read off from ( [ l3 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the sbh in a little more detail .",
    "the starting point is the schwarzschild solution in ef coordinates @xcite    @xmath95    whose @xmath96 part is of the type ( [ ds2 ] ) .",
    "thus the radial variable may be identified with @xmath97 in ( [ ds2 ] ) and with @xmath71 in ( [ v ] ) .",
    "indeed @xmath98 yields the correct singularity behavior and the corresponding psm action ( [ lagr ] ) with    @xmath99    in the second order formulation ( after eliminating the fields @xmath100 , and @xmath71 and using their equations of motion ) the action reads @xmath101    now the metric remains as the only dynamical variable .",
    "this action does not look very attractive because of the fractional power of curvature , but in the euclidean formulation it is positive definite and thus may be useful for quantization . by construction this model beside the flat minkowskian solution has the solution of the true sbh .",
    "it should be stressed that the model ( [ r23 ] ) reproduces the @xmath102-part of the sbh globally and not only near the singularity .",
    "the above analysis may be extended easily to include also powers of @xmath103 in ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "for example @xmath104 improves the dbh to make it null incomplete . in that case @xmath105 for @xmath90 , diverges slightly less than for the dbh . for exponential behavior in kruskal coordinates @xmath106 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 diverges exponentially as well . in that case",
    "both null and non - null extremals are incomplete .",
    "although satisfactory in this respect the corresponding psm potential @xmath109 at @xmath110 does not seem particularly useful for applications in bh models .",
    "the pure psm model for the sbh with potential ( [ v2 ] ) is fraught with an important drawback : when matter is added the conserved quantity @xmath111 in ( [ newc ] ) simply generalizes to a similar conserved one with additional matter contributions ( cf . the second ref .",
    "thus even before a bh is formed by the influx of matter an eternal singularity as given e.g. by ( [ v2 ] ) for the sbh , is present in which the mass @xmath112 basically can not be modified by the additional matter . a general method to produce at the same time a singularity",
    " free ground state with , say , @xmath113 is provided by a weyl transformation of the original metric .",
    "it simply generalizes what is really behind the well - known construction of the dbh theory .",
    "consider the transformation @xmath114 in ( [ ds2 ] ) with ( [ kill ] ) together with a transformation of @xmath71    @xmath115    this reproduces the metric @xmath116 in ef form @xmath117 with a flat ground ",
    "state @xmath113 . integrating out @xmath76 and @xmath118 in ( [ lagr ] ) , and using the identity ( [ change ] ) with @xmath119",
    "one arrives at a generalized dilaton theory    @xmath120    where @xmath71 is to be re - expressed by @xmath121 through the integral of ( [ 92 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the ( minimal ) coupling to matter is covariant under this redefinition of fields .",
    "clearly ( [ 95 ] ) is the most general action in @xmath1 where the flat ground state corresponds to @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123 may determine an arbitrarily complicated singularity structure .",
    "the dbh is the special case @xmath124 then @xmath125 is easily seen to be proportional to the dilaton field .",
    "the sbh results from the choice @xmath126 using ( [ 92 ] ) and comparing ( [ 93 ] ) with ( [ ef ] ) in that case with the interaction constant in @xmath127 fixed by @xmath128 , the conserved quantity @xmath111 is identified with the mass @xmath112 of the bh and ( [ 95 ] ) turns into the action of spherically reduced 4d general relativity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately such a theory can not be solved exactly if coupling to matter is introduced .",
    "therefore , in the next section a large class of models is studied which contain the sbh as a special case .",
    "as discussed already in the last section , any psm model is locally equivalent to a generalized dilaton model @xcite . in the present section we consider all global solutions of the action    @xmath129    and",
    "compare them with the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this form of the lagrangian covers e.g. the cghs model @xcite for @xmath10 , @xmath130 , spherically reduced gravity @xcite @xmath131 , @xmath132 , the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite @xmath8 , @xmath133 .",
    "lemos and sa @xcite give the global solutions for @xmath134 and all values of @xmath135 , mignemi @xcite considers @xmath10 and all values of @xmath136 .",
    "the models of @xcite correspond to @xmath137 .",
    "the different models can be arranged in an @xmath135 vs. @xmath136 diagram ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ ldil ] ) is obtained from ( [ lagr ] ) by the `` generalized dilatonization '' , as explained in the last section with @xmath82 replaced by @xmath138 in ( [ change ] )    @xmath139    where @xmath135 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we also replace @xmath71 by the usual dilaton field    @xmath140    and restrict ourselves to a power behavior in @xmath73 @xmath141 depending on the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "using the general solution ( [ zweib]),([zweibb ] ) and defining coordinates @xmath143 , @xmath144 immediately yields the line element corresponding to ( [ ldil ] )    @xmath145    with @xmath146    @xmath147    where @xmath111 is the arbitrary constant defined in ( [ newc ] ) .",
    "calculations can be performed in this form or by changing to a new variable    @xmath148    to obtain the ef form ( [ ds2 ] ) of the metric with    @xmath149    where the constants are given by @xmath150 the range of @xmath151 for @xmath10 is @xmath152 $ ] whereas from ( [ gl:34c ] ) one has @xmath153 and for @xmath154 the range is reduced to @xmath155 $ ] and for @xmath43 it is @xmath156 $ ] . now",
    "the scalar curvature in the ef coordinates @xmath157 can be easily calculated @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 to be determined easily from ( [ a1 ] ) . in the following",
    "we will continue our analysis in terms of @xmath82 which can always be transformed to @xmath151 by means of ( [ gl:34c ] ) .",
    "we see that depending on the values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 the scalar curvature may be singular in the limits @xmath161 . in fig.2 the dashed regions show singularities of the scalar curvature . in the limit",
    "@xmath162 the singular regions are different for zero and nonzero value of @xmath111 , @xmath163 the singularity of @xmath108 may be positive or negative depending on the values of the constants @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath142 , and @xmath111 as can be easily seen from ( [ curv])([ecoboa ] ) . in the limit @xmath164 the scalar curvature is singular when @xmath165    now one has to analyse the behavior and completeness of extremals corresponding to the line element ( [ metric ] ) . for the first term in ( [ newl ] ) the behavior at the singularity for @xmath166 , @xmath43 coincides with ( [ l2 ] ) if @xmath167 and if @xmath135 denotes the same parameter as in section 2 .",
    "however for a general discussion of ( [ newl ] ) the behavior of both terms and the zeros of @xmath72 ( horizons ) are better discussed in terms of the general procedure as outlined in @xcite of which a summary also was given in @xcite .",
    "the equations for extremals for the ef metric read @xmath168 @xmath169 thus the null extremals @xmath170 are always complete because @xmath171 follows from ( [ 37 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "the second null direction @xmath172 inserted into ( [ 37 ] ) also yields @xmath173 or equivalently @xmath174 thus the completeness of null extremals depends only on @xmath135 : @xmath175 as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the physically unreasonable behavior of null extremals in this case , encountered already in section 2 , thus has been reconfirmed also here .",
    "the affine parameter of non - null extremals is obtained from an integral similar to ( [ gl7 ] )    @xmath176    identifying the affine parameter @xmath177 with the @xmath178 in ( [ ds2 ] ) , these extremals are found to obey    @xmath179\\ ] ]    by simply solving a quadratic equation .",
    "in addition , from ( [ gl:53 ] ) and ( [ gl:54 ] ) the affine parameter is determined by @xmath180    for @xmath181 , resp . @xmath182",
    "the parameter @xmath183 is a timelike , resp .",
    "spacelike quantity . as for the null extremals",
    "our results are given in terms of @xmath82 .",
    "non null extremals turn out to be complete for @xmath184 as depicted in fig.3b , c .",
    "one observes that only for @xmath185 the region of incompleteness coincides with the one for @xmath186 except for the point @xmath187 where non null extremals are complete at the curvature singularity .",
    "as depicted in fig.2 we find for some distinct values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 de sitter space or flat space - time solutions : @xmath188 furthermore we get the special regions : @xmath189    now elegant methods @xcite exist to find the global structure of 2d models . equation ( [ second ] ) determines the shape for a certain patch , e.g. the typical one for a black hole drawn in fig.4a . the fully extended global solution across the dotted lines is obtained by gluing together patches of this type identifying lines with @xmath190 and exchanging the two null directions @xcite by an ( always existing ) diffeomorphism in the overlapping square or triangle .",
    "this simply amounts to using reflected or rotated building blocks of the same structure , so as to arrive e.g. for the bh at its characteristic penrose diagram fig.4b .",
    "for definiteness we consider the case @xmath191 .",
    "the case @xmath192 is obtained by rotating the diagrams for @xmath193 by 90 degrees , because formally both cases are related to each other by exchanging the coordinates of space and time .",
    "up to a rotation there are six types of penrose diagrams d1,  ,d6 , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "the boundaries of the diagrams correspond to infinite values of the dilaton field @xmath194 as indicated .",
    "there the scalar curvature may be singular or nonsingular .",
    "for the moment we concentrate on the shape of the diagrams which is defined entirely by the function @xmath195 ( [ gl:34 ] ) or ( [ gl:34b ] ) . therefore it does not depend on the value of @xmath135 .",
    "we summarize the types of penrose diagrams corresponding to different values of the constants in the following table :    @xmath196 for @xmath197 , @xmath198 a global solution is of the type d2 , whereas for @xmath199 one has a flat solution . using ( [ curv])([ecuspn ] ) , or equivalently fig.2 it is straightforward to verify where boundaries are singular , asymptotically flat or correspond to constant curvature .",
    "completeness at the boundaries follows immediately from ( [ econep])([econnm ] ) .    in order to admit a schwarzschild like global solution",
    ", the penrose diagram must be of the type d5 with incomplete spacelike singular boundary @xmath200 and complete asymptotically flat boundary @xmath164 .",
    "the above analysis proves that this happens if and only if the parameters satisfy the following conditions @xmath201 in fig.6 we have tried to summarize all possible cases with one horizon .",
    "the range of ( [ tabscs ] ) corresponds to the lower left corner @xmath202    known soluble models with couplings to scalar matter @xcite always start from an undilatonized ( psm  type ) action with @xmath203 , i.e. from a flat theory in which scalar fields are introduced .",
    "the subsequent dilatonization moves the singularity to the factor of @xmath111 , as explained in the previous section and @xmath204 should be a minkowskian space - time .",
    "we want to stress again that in the presence of matter it is this factor ( the mass parameter ) which is changed by the influx of matter , starting say with a ground state @xmath122 .",
    "the only possibility to start with a minkowskian space - time before matter flows in @xmath205 is the case when the @xmath206-term of ( [ newl ] ) looses its @xmath151 dependence completely , which implies that @xmath207 . from fig.6",
    "we see immediately that the cghs model as well as spherically reduced 4d gravity lie on that line .",
    "if one is interested to reproduce a sbh like model this means that one has to start out with an action of the restricted form @xmath208 similarly we see that for @xmath130 one inevitably obtains rindler space - time @xcite except for the cghs model @xmath209 .    the soluble models with matter couplings ( corresponding to @xmath210 @xcite ) are compatible with @xmath207 only at @xmath10 , i.e. for the dbh .",
    "although the curvature vanishes for the asymptotic rindler like space - times in these models this could be interpreted as observing a black hole formation and its hawking radiation from an accelerating frame  which does not seem very satisfactory .",
    "it may be added that also the problem of a mass independent hawking temperature @xmath211 appears for @xmath130 models .",
    "we take its geometric definition @xcite from the norm of the killing vector @xmath212 at the horizon , determined by @xmath213 , @xmath214 i.e. @xmath215    using ( [ newl ] ) one easily finds the hawking temperature @xmath216 where minus and plus signs in eq.([hawktemp3 ] ) correspond to the cases @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , @xmath220 respectively . in the case @xmath221 the black hole solution is absent as follows from ( [ tabscs ] ) .",
    "we see that the models with @xmath130 share the unpleasant feature with the @xmath222 that @xmath211 is then independent of the conserved quantity @xmath111 interpreted as the mass since @xmath223 disappears . another interesting consequence of eqs.([hawktemp3 ] ) , ( [ hawktemp4 ] ) is the restriction on the coupling constants following from the positiveness of the temperature : only the first two cases in ( [ tabscs ] ) survive .",
    "because systematic investigations of the global properties of bh models are still relatively rare , an important defect of the ordinary dilaton black hole relative to the genuine schwarzschild one seems to have been overlooked until now : its singularity is only incomplete with respect to _ non  null _ extremals .",
    "the special role of the dbh has been put into perspective by first embedding it into a family of singularities , to be analyzed according to a power behavior in kruskal coordinates near the singularity .",
    "we also found a large class of models which comprises well known theories and which possesses bhs for a certain range of the parameters .",
    "demanding furthermore that for @xmath122 ( no matter ) we have minkowski space reduces the allowed region to a straigth line @xmath207 ( cf .",
    "not surprisingly spherically reduced 4d gravity corresponds to one point on that line @xmath224 as well as the dbh @xmath209 . for exactly solvable models with matter ,",
    "withtin this class of theories the asymptotic background inevitably is of rindler type and thus may lead to problems of interpretation . in our opinion",
    "a soluble model ( after interaction with scalar matter is added ) with qualitative features coinciding completely with the sbh still waits to be discovered .",
