    "recent observations on cosmological scales suggest the presence of a non - zero cosmological constant or dark energy in the universe . adopting spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models , type ia supernovae @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite are simultaneously well fit by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the dimensionless cosmological constant and the density parameter of non - relativistic matter , respectively .",
    "in fact , nearly all the available observational data are in good agreement with the above model parameters .",
    "on the other hand , the physical origin and nature of such dark energy components remain to be understood . in this paper",
    "we will consider a possible deviation from newton s law of gravity that are motivated by recent proposals for an alternative to dark energy @xcite or as a possible consequence of dark energy @xcite . while this idea seems exotic ,",
    "the validity of newton s law has not been demonstrated rigorously on cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of dark energy in the standard frw model is equivalent to introducing a repulsive force in the cosmic expansion . in a sense",
    ", this is equivalent to changing newton s law of gravity on cosmological scales by modifying the matter content of the universe .",
    "the idea behind this paper is to explore observable consequences of a modification of gravity itself .",
    "we note that in retrospect this is closer to einstein s original idea in introducing the cosmological constant ; he introduced the @xmath10-term on the left - hand side of the field equation . nowadays this term is usually interpreted as an additional term in the energy - momentum tensor on the right - hand side .    while our current approach is entirely empirical ,",
    "there have been several specific attempts to construct self - consistent cosmological models including deviations from newton s law on cosmological scales .",
    "for instance , dvali , gabadadze and porrati proposed a scenario ( dgp model , hereafter ) @xcite to explain the accelerating universe as a result of gravity leaking into extra dimensions in the context of a braneworld model . according to the dgp model , the accelerating universe",
    "is naturally explained without dark energy component , but rather by the modification of newton s law of gravity on cosmological scales .",
    "a variety of astrophysical and cosmological consequences of the dgp model were discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "other proposals which suggest deviations from newton gravity on very large scales include a `` ghost condensation '' model @xcite .",
    "we would like to derive constraints on deviations from newton s law that are independent of any specific models to the extent possible .",
    "thus , we adopt an empirical parameterization of the deviation from newton s law over @xmath11 mpc scales while the cosmic expansion is assumed to exactly follow that of the standard frw model .    note",
    "that , strictly speaking , our approach is not fully self - consistent in that our modified gravity law has an effective gravitational constant @xmath12 asymptotically in the large - scale limit , but we still assume that the cosmic expansion follows the standard frw cosmology with @xmath13 . as discussed below , however , this does not significantly change our conclusions .",
    "sealfon et al .",
    "@xcite recently carried out a similar analysis in the same spirit .",
    "they derive linear theory predictions for the matter power spectrum in modified gravity models and obtain constraints on deviations from the inverse - square law using 2df ( two - degree field ) and sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) galaxy data .",
    "our paper differs from theirs in the following three respects : ( a ) we do not assume _ a priori _ that any fractional deviation from newton s law is small .",
    "the analysis of sealfon et al . is applicable only in a perturbative regime ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "( b ) sealfon et al . solved the linear perturbation equation for the growth of density fluctuations assuming an incorrect scaling between wave - number and the scale factor .",
    "we , however , solve the original perturbation equation without such a scaling assumption .",
    "finally ( c ) we take into account gravitational non - linearity by applying the peacock - dodds prescription @xcite . as a result",
    ", we believe that the constraints in our paper are more reliable .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes our models for modified gravity . in sec .",
    "iii we solve the linear perturbation equation for density fluctuations in modified gravity models , and the nonlinear power spectra are computed in sec .",
    "iv by applying the peacock - dodds prescription .",
    "section v compares these theoretical predictions with the observed power spectrum of sdss galaxies .",
    "finally sec .",
    "vi is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "[ sec : method ]",
    "the basic equation that we solve in this paper is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a fractional mass density fluctuation , @xmath17 is the mean mass density , @xmath18 is the hubble parameter , @xmath19 is the modified newtonian potential and @xmath20 is a proper coordinate .",
    "the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath21 . to solve equation one has to specify the functional form of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we will confront theoretical predictions against the observed power spectrum of sdss galaxies .",
    "thus we need an additional assumption of the spatial biasing of sdss galaxies with respect to the underlying dark matter .",
    "we adopt the following four major assumptions in performing the analysis .",
    "\\(i ) for the gravitational potential @xmath19 , we consider two models .",
    "the first ( model i ) is to simply change the amplitude of newton s constant , @xmath13 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a scale - independent parameter characterizing the deviation .",
    "the effective gravitational constant in this model is simply @xmath24 . while this simple model is useful in understanding a basic outcome of modified gravitational theories , it may be inconsistent with precise tests of newton s gravity on small scales",
    ". therefore we also consider another model ( model ii ) where the deviation is restricted to scales larger than @xmath1 : @xmath25}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath1 is defined in proper , rather than comoving , length , and we consider @xmath26 below .",
    "equation ( [ eq : modelii ] ) recovers the conventional newton potential for @xmath27 , and asymptotically approaches model i with @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the transition between these two regimes is described by the yukawa - like term but our result below is insensitive to that particular choice .",
    "\\(ii ) we assume that general relativity is valid on the horizon scale , i.e. , that the cosmic expansion is described by the standard frw model . strictly speaking",
    ", this assumption may not be fully consistent with our modified gravity law on local scales ( models i and ii ) .",
    "however , our primary interest in this paper is the matter clustering on scales of @xmath30 , which should not be affected by evolution of structure on much larger scales that are in the linear regime .",
    "in other words , even if we introduced another cutoff in model ii so as to recover the newton gravity at scales @xmath31 , our results would hardly be affected .",
    "this explains why we use the frw model in describing the cosmic expansion while non - newtonian gravity controls the dark matter clustering .",
    "for the same reason , we assume that our modification of gravity does not change the angular power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "in reality , we do not necessarily have to assume the validity of general relativity on horizon scales ; the unperturbed model could differ from general relativity and still be consistent with observations",
    ". we will defer exploring such possibilities for now and adopt this assumption just for simplicity throughout the present analysis .",
    "\\(iii ) in addition , we assume that the universe is dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and/or the cosmological constant .",
    "to be specific , we consider two spatially flat models with and without the cosmological constant : @xmath32 ( table i ) . hence we use the conventional models for the hubble parameter @xmath33 in equation and the matter transfer function @xcite .",
    ".[tab : table1]parameters of cosmological models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we focus on linear evolution of density fluctuation and solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : basiceq ] ) for the two models .",
    "let us begin with model i. in this case , the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : modeli ] ) in the comoving coordinate yields @xmath34}_{\\bk }      = 4 \\pi g a^2 { \\bar{\\rho}}{\\left(}1 + \\alpha_0 { \\right)}\\delta_{\\bk},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the scale factor ( normalized to unity at @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 is the comoving coordinate and we define @xmath40 as the comoving wave - number .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkmodeli ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : basiceq ] ) , we obtain @xmath41 in spatially flat models , where @xmath42 is the hubble constant at the present .",
    "in particular , we find that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqmodeli ] ) has an analytic solution in the einstein - de sitter model : @xmath43 figure [ fig : fig1 ] plots the linear growth rate in model i as a function of @xmath35 which is independent of @xmath44 .",
    "the amplitude in this figure is normalized @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "next consider model ii . in fourier space ,",

    "the first and second terms of the right - hand side in eq.([eq : somodelii ] ) correspond to the growing and decaying modes , respectively .",
    "note that sealfon et al .",
    "@xcite introduced @xmath53 and attempted to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqmodelii ] ) for @xmath54 : @xmath55},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 denotes the growing mode of density fluctuations for the @xmath57 case . in doing",
    "so they neglect higher - order terms of @xmath0 and assume that @xmath58 can be written entirely as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "their scaling assumption is correct only in the einstein - de sitter model , but does not hold in general since the hubble parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqmodelii ] ) depends on @xmath35 and thus @xmath60 can not be expressed only in terms of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore we chose to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqmodelii ] ) directly , without neglecting higher - order terms of @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the linear growth rate in model ii as a function of @xmath35 , which is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ; the left and right panels correspond to @xmath61 and @xmath62 and to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . in this case , the result depends on @xmath44 and @xmath1 as well , and we show the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath44-dependence in the top , middle , and bottom panels .",
    "we emphasize here that @xmath1 is defined in proper coordinates .",
    "hence the gravity on the comoving scale corresponding to @xmath44 starts to deviate from the conventional newton potential after @xmath65 .",
    "this is why all of the curves in fig.[fig : fig2 ] are degenerate for @xmath66 , and also explains the fact that the linear growth rate for smaller @xmath44 deviates earlier from the @xmath57 case in the bottom panels .",
    "our next task is to apply a correction for gravitational non - linearity to the linear predictions described in the previous section .",

    "we use the fitting formula @xcite for @xmath69 which takes into account the baryon effect ( we adopt @xmath72 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized here that we choose the amplitude @xmath73 so that the rms value of the top - hat mass fluctuation at @xmath74mpc equals those listed in table i _ when @xmath75 and @xmath76_. strictly speaking , however , our modified ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) gravity models distort the linear spectrum due to the factor @xmath79 ^ 2 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pl ] ) .",
    "hence the actual value of @xmath80 in each model is slightly different from that in the @xmath75 case .",

    "we designate @xmath86 and @xmath87 as the linear and non - linear power spectra .",
    "consider model ii first .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] plots the linear and non - linear power spectra for @xmath88 in the @xmath10-cdm model with @xmath89 and @xmath90 . dashed and solid curves indicate @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is plotted in dotted curves for reference . since all our models have @xmath94 ( table",
    "i ) , the non - linearity shows up around wave - numbers @xmath95 .",
    "as expected , the effect of modified gravity becomes significant for @xmath96 .",
    "c +    in contrast , model i does not change the nonlinear power spectrum at @xmath36 relative to the @xmath97 case _ if _ one adopts the identical value of @xmath80 at @xmath36 .",
    "since the linear growth rate for model i ( eq . ( [ eq : somodeli ] ) ) is independent of @xmath44 , the above statement is obvious for linear power spectra . the possible difference would come from the nonlinear evolution .",
    "if one evolves @xmath97 and @xmath98 model spectra from an earlier epoch with the identical amplitude ( i.e. , @xmath80 at that epoch ) , they lead to different values of @xmath80 at @xmath36 because the @xmath23-dependent overall growth rate , and thus to different shape of the power spectra due to the nonlinear effect . instead",
    ", if one chooses the identical value of @xmath80 at @xmath36 , the power spectra of @xmath97 and @xmath99 models are also identical even taking into account the nonlinear effect . to disentangle model i from the @xmath100 model , therefore",
    ", one has to compare @xmath101 at different redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] displays the value of @xmath80 as a function of @xmath102 . since this value is computed by extrapolating linear theory , it can be directly obtained from the linear growth rate plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "thus in model i the structure evolves at a different rate even if the underlying cosmological parameters ( @xmath9 and @xmath8 ) are identical .",
    "for example , we would need determinations of @xmath80 at multiple redshifts to resolve the degeneracy .",
    "c +    [ sec : constraints ]",
    "we are now in a position to explore observational constraints on deviations from newton s law of gravity . in order to compare the model predictions described in the previous section against observations , we use the power spectrum of @xmath103 galaxies derived from sdss by tegmark et al .",

    "their measurements are in good agreement with our @xmath10-cdm model listed in table i as long as @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] compares non - linear power spectra for model ii against those for the sdss galaxies in the @xmath10-cdm model ; figure [ fig : fig5](a ) shows the @xmath0-dependence for the @xmath106 case , while fig .",

    "our model ii , eq . ( [ eq : modelii ] ) , is intended to represent a reasonable approximation to a wide class of possible models which recover newton s gravity on small scales but depart from it on large scales .",
    "in contrast , frieman and gradwohl @xcite and gradwohl and frieman @xcite considered a different non - newtonian gravity model which deviates from newton s law on smaller scales , but approaches it asymptotically on larger scales .",
    "while their specific model of gravity law is different from that studied here , they extensively discussed the effects on linear perturbation theory and explored the resulting implications for large - scale structure .",
    "more recently nusser , gubser and peebles @xcite considered cosmological constraints on a similar model of gravity which deviates on small scales . in order to avoid conflict with laboratory tests of newton s law",
    ", they have to assume that non - newtonian gravity applies only to dark matter ; their model is based on the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the dark sector consists of two mutually coupled fields ( dark matter and dark energy ) , and the length scale @xmath1 is constant in _ comoving _ coordinate .",
    "this is why their model substantially changes the nonlinear clustering behavior while our model mostly modifies the weakly nonlinear regime .    in either case ,",
    "more specific models of non - newtonian gravity are needed in order to tighten the constraints .",
    "possible proposals include the dgp model in the context of the braneworld scenario @xcite , and a relativistic version of the modified newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "these examples are attractive in the sense that they offer specific modified gravity laws on local scales and modified friedmann equations simultaneously in a consistent fashion",
    ". therefore we could derive more stringent constraints .",
    "using the sdss galaxy power spectrum is appropriate for constraining the deviation around @xmath125mpc scales .",
    "if a deviation from newton s law occurs at scales below @xmath126mpc , strong gravitational nonlinearity will be important , and nonlinear spherical collapse analysis and/or direct n - body simulations would be needed to explore the dynamical consequences for dark halos at galaxy and cluster scales . if the deviation scale is much larger than @xmath127mpc , on the other hand , it is unlikely to leave any detectable signature on cosmic structures .",
