    "we study the cold disk spectrum of cyg x-1 in the soft state .",
    "the source was observed simultaneously by _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ on 1996 may 30 .",
    "these data were previously analyzed by dotani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cui et al .",
    "dotani and his collaborators examined the _",
    "data only .",
    "they used a multi - color disk blackbody model ( ` diskbb ' in xspec , see e.g. mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) and found @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 km , where they give the correction factor for ` diskbb ' model , @xmath2 .",
    "they also applied a general relativistic disk model ( ` grad ' in xspec , hanawa 1989 ) , assuming the disk extends down to the last stable orbit in the schwarzschild metric , and found a central object mass of @xmath3m@xmath4 .",
    "cui et al .",
    "analysed simultaneous _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ observation .",
    "their results concerning the disk parameters are similar to the above ones .",
    "the soft  state spectrum of cyg x-1 basically consists of two main components : the cold disk emission below @xmath53 kev and a power - law continuum extending into @xmath6-rays ( see figure [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "we model the disk emission by the multi - color disk blackbody with the torque - free boundary condition in the pseudo - newtonian potential ( see below ) . for the continuum we use a hybrid thermal / non - thermal model plus compton reflection from the cold matter ( gierliski et al .",
    "our cold disk model is as follows .",
    "we consider a standard , flat , optically thick accretion disk around a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath7 .",
    "we use the following definitions : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "subscript ` in ' denotes the inner disk radius .",
    "we adopt the pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) , @xmath13 which yields the color temperature distribution along the disk radius , @xmath14^{1/4},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 the maximum of local temperature is @xmath16 we create the model spectrum of the accretion disk integrating the observed flux , @xmath17 , numerically .",
    "our model has three parameters : the inner disk radius , @xmath18 , the maximum temperature , @xmath19 , and the normalization , @xmath20 from which the absolute value of the inner disk radius , @xmath21 , can be derived , assuming distance to the source , @xmath22 , and the disk inclination angle , @xmath23 .",
    "we point out that the above model differs from the commonly - used ` diskbb ' model , in which the torque - free boundary condition is neglected and temperature distribution is simplified , @xmath24 discrepancy between the temperature distributions , as shown on figure [ fig : disk_temp ] , is crucial when the disk extends down to the last stable orbit . nevertheless , the integrated spectrum , @xmath17 , is similar , after some shift in parameters .",
    "we find that in the case of @xmath25 = 6 our model spectrum for given @xmath21 and @xmath19 may be approximated by the ` diskbb ' spectrum , for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the two models differ significantly in the accretion efficiency .",
    "the total disk luminosity in the pseudo - newtonian disk ( pn ) model is @xmath28 giving the accretion efficiency , @xmath29 = 1/16 = 0.0625 , very close to the exact value in the schwarzschild metric , @xmath30 = 1 - ( 8/9)@xmath31 0.0572 ( e.g.  kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ) , whereas the ` diskbb ' model yields @xmath32 with very inaccurate efficiency , @xmath33 = 1/4 .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate calculated from the ` diskbb ' model is @xmath54 times less then the actual one .",
    "in all fits hereafter we assume @xmath22 = 2.5 kpc , @xmath23 = 45@xmath34 and @xmath35 = 1.7 .",
    "first , we assume that the optically thick accretion disk extends all the way down to the last stable orbit in the schwarzschild metric , @xmath25 = 6 . from the spectral",
    "fitting we obtain @xmath36 ev and @xmath37 km , corresponding to a central object mass , @xmath38m@xmath4 and an accretion rate , @xmath39 g s@xmath40 .",
    "the result obtained from the ` diskbb ' model ( dotani et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath1 km , yields @xmath41 km , when @xmath42 = 25/16 is applied",
    ". however , as we have shown in the previous section , @xmath43 , and this result should be rather @xmath44 km , much less that we have found .",
    "the similar value can be computed for the paper by cui et al .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath21 derived from our model and these results comes from the different continuum model assumed .",
    "dotani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used simply a broken power law , which fails to approximate properly the comptonization spectrum at low energies .",
    "cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) adopted a thermal comptonization continuum , which at low energies should agree with our non - thermal model .",
    "however , the pure thermal model fails to reproduce the observed high - energy tail and can not fit the data properly ( gierliski et al .",
    "1998 ) . due to this limitation cui and",
    "his collaborators obtained a very high temperature of seed photons for comptonization , @xmath45 kev , which , in turn , affected the low - energy part of their model spectrum .",
    "an interesting result can be obtained , when the relative inner disk radius , @xmath46 , is allowed to be a free fit parameter .",
    "the shape of the disk spectrum changes slightly with increasing @xmath25 , and we find these changes large enough to constrain @xmath25 by the data . a fit is improved ( by @xmath47 = 6.0/574 ) with the new best - fit value of @xmath48 .",
    "the case of the disk extending down to the last stable orbit is _ outside _ the error bars here , suggesting that presumably cyg x-1 did not finish its transition to the soft state yet .",
    "this result is further supported by temporal properties of cyg x-1 .",
    "the evolution of power spectra , x - ray time lags and a coherence function ( cui et al .",
    "1997 ) indicate that on 1996 may 30 the source was still on transition from the hard to the soft state , while in june the soft state was established .",
    "we note however , that unless all relativistic effects in the strong gravity are properly taken into account , the uncertainties of our disk emission and reflection models do not allow us to make any strong statements .",
    "the other disk parameters found in the @xmath25-free model are @xmath49ev and @xmath50 km , yielding @xmath51m@xmath4 and @xmath52 g s@xmath40 .",
    "to find out whether the cold disk on may 30 did reach the last stable orbit or not , we may try to investigate the stability of the disk . let us consider a standard shakura - sunyaev disk with a fraction @xmath53 of the gravitational energy dissipated in a corona .",
    "this model implies a critical accretion rate , @xmath54 , above which a radiation - pressure dominated region exists in the disk , which is thought to cause an instability .",
    "the critical rate is given by ( svensson & zdziarski 1995 ) @xmath55 where @xmath56m@xmath4 , @xmath57 is the standard viscosity parameter and the relative accretion rate is defined as @xmath58 .",
    "now we examine a case of the disk extending down to the last stable orbit , for which we found the mass , @xmath59 = 16.7 , and the accretion rate , @xmath60 = 0.5 . from the compactness ratio , @xmath61 = 0.36 ( gierliski et al .  1998 )",
    ", we estimate @xmath62 . for @xmath57",
    "= 0.1 the critical rate is @xmath63 .",
    "the actual accretion rate locates the soft state of cyg x-1 at the end of a stable branch of the disk solution .",
    "figure [ fig : mdot_tau ] shows the solutions of the optically thick accretion disk with the corona for @xmath53 = 0 , 0.3 and 0.9 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we drop the assumption of the disk extending down to the last stable orbit , we find @xmath59 = 12 and @xmath64 .",
    "the actual total accretion rate , @xmath65 , is well above the critical one .",
    "the inner part of the disk is thus unstable , which , in fact , is consistent with the truncation in the disk below @xmath66 , we observe . instead of a cold disk , an advective , optically thin , hot solution might exists in this region .",
    "the accretion below 17 @xmath67 dissipates about 0.3 of a total power released in the disk , but due to advection the luminosity of the inner flow might be considerably diminished .",
    "therefore , its thermal emission would be difficult to disentangle from the observed thermal / non - thermal spectrum , and its existence hard to confirm or to rule - out .",
