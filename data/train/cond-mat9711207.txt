    "in this paper we examine the frustrated @xmath0 model in two dimensions for two different values of the magnetic field representative of `` commensurate states '' .",
    "experimental realizations of this model in the form of two - dimensional arrays of josephson junctions and superconducting wire networks @xcite can and have been constructed and one of the objectives of this work is to understand the results of these experiments .",
    "a perpendicular magnetic field induces a finite density of circulating supercurrents , or vortices , within the array .",
    "the interplay of two length scales  the mean separation of vortices and the period of the underlying physical array  gives rise to a wide variety of interesting physical phenomena .",
    "many of these effects show up as variations in the properties of the finite - temperature superconducting phase transitions at different fields . in recent experiments on superconducting arrays",
    "the critical exponents of a number of these phase transitions have been measured @xcite , opening the opportunity to do careful comparison of theory and experiment . while we will discuss the model within the context of superconducting networks , the model is also closely related to the physics of adsorbed films on substrates which impose a periodic potential which differs from the preferred period of the adsorbed film . in this work",
    "we examine the ground state properties , low energy excitations , and critical properties of the 2d @xmath0 model in the densely frustrated regime ( @xmath4 ) for two particular values of the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , we investigate the effect of disorder on the ground state and critical properties .",
    "this paper elaborates and expands upon our previous results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the frustrated @xmath0 model is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the phase on site @xmath7 of a square @xmath8 lattice and @xmath9 is the integral of the vector potential from site @xmath10 to site @xmath7 with @xmath11 being the flux quantum .",
    "the directed sum of the @xmath12 around an elementary plaquette @xmath13 where @xmath14 , measured in the units of @xmath11 , is the magnetic flux penetrating each plaquette due to the uniformly applied field .",
    "we focus here on the cases @xmath15 with @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath2 .    the ground state fluxoid pattern for these @xmath14 is shown in figure  [ stairflux](a ) @xcite .",
    "the pattern consists of diagonal stripes composed of a single line of vortices for @xmath19 and a double line of vortices for @xmath20 .",
    "these diagonal lines of vortices can sit on @xmath21 sub - lattices and , in addition , there are @xmath21 more states with the stripes going along the opposite diagonal for a total of @xmath22 degenerate states .",
    "a common speculation for commensurate - incommensurate transitions and the frustrated @xmath0 model is that the transition should be in the universality class of the q - state ( or 2q - state ) pott s model .",
    "we find that this is not the case because , as discussed below , domain walls between the different states vary considerably in both energetic and entropic factors .",
    "the effect of quenched impurities on phase transitions is an important and fascinating problem .",
    "the `` harris criterion '' @xcite indicates that the addition of ( bond ) randomness to systems which exhibit second - order transitions in the clean case with a positive specific - heat exponent @xmath23 changes the numerical values of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown using phenomenological renormalization - group arguments that the addition of bond randomness to systems undergoing first - order transitions results in a random - field mechanism at any coexistence region which can cause the transition to become continuous @xcite .",
    "aizenman and wehr @xcite have shown quite rigorously that in 2d a quenched random field results , quite generally , in the elimination of discontinuities in the order parameter conjugate to the fluctuating field .",
    "most cases where bond disorder has been studied and observed to change the order of the transition are for q - state potts models , where for @xmath24 chen et al .",
    "@xcite found through extensive monte carlo simulations , that the first - order transition of the pure model became second - order with the critical exponents being consistent with the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",

    "the pattern consists of diagonal stripes composed of a single line of vortices for @xmath19 and a double line of vortices for @xmath20 .",
    "( a vortex is a plaquette with unit fluxoid occupation , i.e. the phase gains @xmath34 when going around the plaquette . )",
    "the stripes shown in figure  [ stairflux ] can sit on @xmath21 sub - lattices , which we associate with members of the @xmath35 group .",
    "they can also go along either diagonal , and we associate these two options with members of the @xmath36 group . in all , there is a total of @xmath22 degenerate states(@xmath37 ) .",
    "a common speculation for commensurate - incommensurate transitions and the frustrated @xmath0 model is that the transition should be in the universality class of the q - state ( or 2q - state ) pott s model .",
    "we find that this is not the case because domain walls between the different states vary considerably in both energetic and entropic factors .",
    "figure  [ stairflux](b)-(e ) shows the fluxoid pattern for some of the domain walls for @xmath1 .",
    "the domain walls can be classified into two types .",
    "_ shift _ walls involve a shift of the vortex pattern across the wall ( such as in fig  [ stairflux](b ) where the pattern on the right is shifted down by one lattice spacings with respect to the pattern on the left ) but the lines of vortices are still going along the same diagonal . _",
    "herringbone _ walls are walls between states with the vortex stripes going along opposite diagonals .",
    "note that there are @xmath21 different walls of each type .",
    "these walls also have differing topologies .",
    "a herringbone wall is very similar to a domain wall in an ising model in that it separates two members of a @xmath36 group .",
    "it can not branch into other herringbone walls and a 90 degree turn in the wall can be accomplished without changing the vortex pattern , with the caveat that one considers the wall to be composed of sections of length equal to the distance between the diagonal lines of vortices ( see figure  [ bent_walls ] ) .",
    "thus , if one only has herringbone walls in the system , the set of possible domain wall configurations is similar to those in an ising model .",
    "shift walls , on the other hand can branch , both into other shift walls ( with the constraint that the sum of the shifts on the walls after the branch be equal to the original shift ) and into a pair of herringbone walls , as shown in figure  [ bent_walls](b ) .",
    "shift walls also have an associated directionality in the sense that an attempt to make a 90 degree turn in a shift - by - n wall results in the wall changing to a shift - by-(q - n ) wall ( see fig .  [ bent_walls](a ) for an illustration ) .",
    "since different shift walls can have quite different energies ( see below ) one finds that bends such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ bent_walls](a ) are energetically highly unfavorable as it can change a wall with low energy into a wall with a very high energy cost . a more energetically favorable kink in a shift wall can be formed by displacing a mismatched vortex on the wall in a direction parallel to the wall@xcite .",
    "this displaces a section of the wall one unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the wall ( see figure [ bent_walls](c ) ) .",
    "typically , one finds only kinks like these of size one or two lattice constants .",
    "larger kinks start to produce long range distortions in the phase field and have higher energy .    in order to calculate the energies of different structures",
    ", we solved the equations ( [ curr_cons ] ) numerically , using a quasi newton method , on lattices with up to @xmath38 sites with constraints fixing the fluxoid occupation of each plaquette ( see appendix [ ap : copt ] ) .",
    "table  [ wall_energies ] lists the energy per unit length @xmath39 for straight domain walls between the various ground states at zero temperature for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one can see from the table that there is typically one or two walls with considerably lower energy than any of the others .",
    "some of the patterns of energies seen in the table can be understood by counting the number of extra vortices in next or next - next - nearest neighbor plaquettes for the vortices along the wall .",
    "for instance , the energy of a @xmath1 shift - by - one wall is about twice that of the standard herringbone wall . looking at figure  [ stairflux](b)-(e ) one can see that if you count the number of next - next - nearest neighbor vortices for vortices along each side of the wall , the shift - by - one wall has twice as many as the herringbone . similarly , walls which place vortices on nearest neighbor sites tend to be of a higher energy , or may not even be stable .",
    "while this does give a rough guide to the pattern of energies , it does not allow a strong comparison of walls with differently spaced vortices .",
    "one can see from figure  [ bent_walls](b ) that a shift wall can be viewed as two adjacent , or _ bound _",
    "herringbone walls . for @xmath1",
    "the energy of two herringbone walls is less than that of a single shift wall and hence , the shift walls should be unstable to breaking up into herringbone walls . as a result",
    ", one expects that in the @xmath1 case if the temperature is high enough for domain walls to enter the system , the herringbone walls should be the only walls present at large length scales . while for @xmath1 , herringbone walls are the only stable walls , this is not true for @xmath3 . for @xmath3",
    "it is energetically favorable for two herringbone walls to bind and form a shift - by - one or shift - by - three wall .",
    "this can lead to more complex domain wall structures and has an important impact on the nature of the finite temperature phase transition .",
    "these issues will be addressed in more detail below .",
    "we also numerically calculated the energy of domain walls that are not straight .",
    "figure [ dom_dom2 ] shows the energy of a square closed domains , formed from herringbone walls , of linear dimension @xmath40 unit cells in a system of size 120x120 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we see that to a very good approximation , the energy scales linearly in @xmath40 . one can , however , work out some corrections to this linear dependence due to the change in the vortex density at the corner of the domains .",
    "for instance in fig .",
    "[ bent_walls](b ) the vortices at opposite corners of the square domain have either an extra next - nearest neighbor vortex or a missing next - nearest neighbor . from a distance , this gives a quadrapole moment to the domain .",
    "as the @xmath41 domain shown in fig  [ bent_walls](b ) is the basic building block of larger domains , one can conclude that larger differently shaped domains will not have a lower moment ( i.e. they will be neutral and have no dipole moment ) .",
    "the interaction of two such quadrapole domains at a distance @xmath42 , large compared to it s size @xmath40 goes like @xmath43 ( if one assumes an isotropic ( which is not really true ) interaction of two `` corner '' charges like @xmath44 ) .",
    "in addition , the self energy of a square quadrapole goes like @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ dom_dom1 ] shows the interaction of some square domains .",
    "one sees that the quadrapole correction is measurable and fits the expected functional form quite well , but that the constants @xmath46 do not match what one would expect from an isotropic calculation .",
    "in fact , the system is not really equivalent to an isotropic 2d coulomb gas , in that the direction along the diagonal lines of vortices in the staircase state is not equivalent to the direction perpendicular to the vortex lines .",
    "we have also calculated the energies of rectangular domains and some other less regular shapes and they have qualitatively similar ( same functional form ) behavior .",
    "the next question is whether or not the quadrapole interaction is likely to be relevant .",
    "one can use an argument similar to that used to argue for a transition in the unfrustrated @xmath0 model .",
    "if you consider the interaction free energy contribution of the quadrapole interaction , it should contain the energetic part @xmath47 and an entropic part @xmath48 from confining the quadrapoles to have a separation less than @xmath49 ( one could do a more accurate calculation of the entropy but it will still have a @xmath50 dependence ) . at the distances at which the @xmath47 form is valid , the @xmath50 term wins all the time ( at finite @xmath51 ) and hence one can argue that the quadrapole interactions should not be relevant .",
    "at low enough temperature , domains should be small , and one is tempted to expand the energy about the ground state configuration . in this treatment ,",
    "the periodic character of the angles is neglected , but the existence of long range order in the vortex lattice partly justifies this method .",
    "the model is replaced by a so - called spin wave approximation which involves expanding the hamiltonian to 2nd order in @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a ground state configuration : @xmath55 by definition , @xmath56 and we just have a quadratic form .",

    ", @xmath70 can be approximated by the green s function for the poisson equation , @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath69 is the lattice spacing and @xmath73 is euler s constant .",
    "this yields @xmath74 so the correlation function of the spin wave fluctuations decreases according to a power law behavior .",

    ", @xmath58 is not a discrete laplacian .",
    "the question is , do we get something similar ?",

    "figure [ swcor ] shows @xmath70 for @xmath1 along a slice in the @xmath42-direction in a finite size system with periodic boundary conditions along the direction of the slice .",
    "the envelope of this curve is well described by the sum of two logarithmic functions , @xmath76 ( where the second term comes from the periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "in addition to this logarithmic part , there is a periodic oscillation , coinciding with the underlying vortex lattice .",
    "in addition to this obvious oscillation , the phase of the oscillation depends on the initial @xmath77 ( the correlation function is not just a function of @xmath78 ) .",
    "the effect of this initial @xmath77 dependent phase at long distances should not be important .",
    "however , distortions centered on nearby sites , and between rows of vortices can partially cancel due to this phase difference .",
    "there is also an anisotropy between the directions perpendicular and parallel to the diagonal lines of vortices .",
    "this anisotropy can , however , be removed in a continuum picture by rescaling the coordinates .",
    "this modified lattice `` green s '' function also has an impact on vortex interactions .",
    "the presence of the logarithmic part ensures that the overall flux balancing ( @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the vortex occupation of plaquette @xmath10 ) is maintained .",
    "however the vortex interaction energy should contain an oscillating component coinciding with the underlying vortex lattice .",
    "the effect of such a component is not entirely clear , especially as the amplitude of the oscillation does not decay away at large distances .",
    "conventional wisdom would suggest that as long as we still have the logarithmic interaction of vortices , they should still undergo a kosterlitz - thouless type of unbinding transition and an associated jump in the helicity modulus @xcite . as we shall see in the next section , it is not entirely clear whether or not this actually happens",
    ". it might be interesting to try to go through and derive the kosterlitz recursion relations with the oscillations as some sort of perturbation to see if it is relevant , although it seems unlikely to do anything but renormalize the core energies .",

    "note that @xmath364 and @xmath365 decays to zero as @xmath366 .",
    "the autocorrelation time @xmath367 is defined as @xmath368 for an exponential relaxation , @xmath367 is the relaxation time , so that for times @xmath369 , @xmath370 is very small .",
    "if @xmath371 we can , therefore neglect the term involving @xmath372 in eq.([auto_der ] ) and one obtains @xmath373 thus , our @xmath323 correlated measurements are equivalent to @xmath374 independent measurements , something that must be taken into account when calculating errors .",
    "the concept of self - averaging ( or lack of ) is extremely important in correctly estimating errors from monte carlo simulations with disorder .",
    "suppose we measure @xmath360 and calculate it s statistical error using @xmath375 from eq.([var ] ) .",

    "random systems exhibit a lack of self averaging near the critical point @xcite .",
    "in fact , the distribution of most quantities ( over realizations of disorder ) is not even gaussian , making the use of @xmath375 as a measure of the statistical error somewhat questionable .    in calculating errors",
    "we make use of , among other things , the bootstrap resampling technique described in @xcite and more compactly in @xcite . from the set of data @xmath376 produced by our monte carlo simulation we calculate a set @xmath377 of parameters such as the energy , order parameter , etc . due to the random sampling ,",
    "@xmath376 is not a unique realization of the true parameters @xmath378 . with different initial conditions or other slight variations we could have measured any of an infinite number of other realizations @xmath379 , @xmath380 , @xmath381 .",
    "although the set @xmath377 is not the true one @xmath378 , we assume that the shape of the probability distribution @xmath382 , is the same , or very nearly the same , as the shape of the probability distribution @xmath383 .",
    "this is not an assumption that @xmath377 and @xmath378 are the same , it is just assuming that the way in which random errors enter the simulation does not vary rapidly as a function of @xmath378 , so that @xmath377 can serve as a reasonable surrogate .",
    "suppose we have in some way obtained a set of equivalent realizations of our data .",
    "for each realization @xmath384 we calculate the parameters @xmath385 in the same way as we obtained @xmath377 from @xmath376 .",
    "each simulated measured parameter set yields a point @xmath386 .",
    "if we simulate enough data sets we can map out the desired probability distribution for the parameter space . as mentioned above , this distribution of parameters is not necessarily gaussian so we require some means of defining what we mean by the statistical error .",
    "we take the statistical error to be width of the confidence region that contains 68% of the data ( i.e. the confidence region is defined by the interval @xmath387 where , given the set of realizations of the parameter @xmath42 , 68% of the @xmath388 lie between @xmath389 and @xmath390 ) . in this way , if our distribution is gaussian , our definition of the error is just the standard deviation , as one would want for compatibility with the standard case .",
    "it only remains to explain how we obtain `` a set of equivalent realizations of our data '' .",
    "the bootstrap method @xcite used the actual data set @xmath376 , with it s @xmath391 `` independent '' data points , to generate any number of synthetic data sets @xmath392 , with @xmath393 data points .",
    "the procedure is simply to draw @xmath393 data points at a time _ with replacement _ from the set @xmath376 . for the bond disordered systems this includes bootstrap resampling of the set of realizations of bond disorder , as well as bootstrap resampling of the data from an individual realization of disorder .",
    "the basic idea behind the bootstrap is that the actual data set , viewed as a probability distribution , is the best available estimator of the underlying probability distribution .",
