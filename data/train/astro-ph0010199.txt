    "in this paper , we discuss the results of a range of experiments performed with a 1-dimensional hydrocode to determine the characteristics of vertical oscillations of the interstellar medium .",
    "we were interested in the dynamics of the ism in the direction normal to the plane of the galaxy ( i.e. the vertical direction ) .",
    "because our model treats the distribution of the ism as plane parallel , we sometimes refer to this as the `` galactic atmosphere problem . ''",
    "our experiments were aimed toward shedding some light on four observed aspects of the interstellar medium .",
    "the first of these aspects is the fact that in roughly half of the northern sky , 21 cm observations indicate that there are two primary components to the material distribution , a low velocity component and another , comparable in column density , which is falling toward the plane with a velocity on the order of 50 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. stark et al .",
    "1992 ; see figure [ fig20 ] for a typical profile ) .",
    "this infalling component has been studied extensively ( e.g. danly et al .",
    "1992 ) and named the iv ( intermediate velocity ) arch .",
    "our experiments explored dynamical situations that could lead to such velocity segregation , a circumstance that we refer to loosely as the `` falling sky . ''",
    "the second aspect is revealed by the uv absorption line spectrum of hd 93521 ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ) , a star which has a @xmath0 distance of about 1.5 kpc and lies behind the iv arch .",
    "the h  i spectrum in that direction shows the usual two components , with considerably more than thermal broadening , and one rather narrower component at roughly -10 km s@xmath1  heliocentric velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the uv spectrum ( with the reduced thermal broadening of the lines of the heavier elements ) shows a total of about 10 components , which have been interpreted as localized regions of enhanced density .",
    "however , it is well known that velocity crowding ( caustics in the velocity distribution ) can produce spectral features in an otherwise uniform medium .",
    "hence we performed experiments to explore whether the features observed toward this star might in part derive from typical interstellar velocity irregularities rather than density concentrations in space .",
    "the third aspect involves the structure of spiral arms in galaxies .",
    "such arms are generally not entirely smooth and continuous , having localized regions of enhanced contrast , in a pattern that could be called feathering .",
    "one gets the impression that ( as in the wake of a boat ) there are wavelets that are not traveling normal to the locus of the arms .",
    "in addition , there are larger irregularities - pieces of arms or spurs - that branch off of the smooth locus of the more regular pattern .",
    "martos & cox ( 1998 ) began to explore the vertical structure anticipated for a spiral arm , including the thick disk and the significant nonthermal pressure .",
    "they used only a two - dimensional model , but speculated on some of the potential three - dimensional characteristics , including the possibility that arm substructure might be related to resonances in the induced vertical motions . in this paper",
    "we have performed two sets of experiments useful in exploring the relevance of this idea , determining the normal modes of vertical oscillations and the timescale for interstellar material to return to the galactic plane after being set into motion away from it .",
    "the fourth aspect is related to the substantial quantities of high stage ions ( in particular c  iv , n  v , and o  vi ) found well off the plane of the galaxy , with apparent scale heights up to several kpc ( savage & massa 1987 ) . a variety of possible sources for these ions have been suggested .",
    "here we are exploring only one , a possibility related to the suggestion by sciama ( 1972 ) that the outer boundary of the cool interstellar medium might be chromospheric , with a layer of hot gas beyond that .",
    "our final set of experiments was aimed at examining the structure of the outer edge of the disk resulting from mechanical disturbances within it , to learn whether the transition to a hot outer layer is a natural consequence .",
    "the simulations in this paper were performed with a 1-d plane parallel lagrangian hydrocode . unlike some other lagrangian codes ( e.g. bowers & wilson 1991 ) , ours did not make use of a mass coordinate for simplifying the computation of derivatives . instead , our code was constructed to maintain second order accuracy by differentiating ( and interpolating ) explicitly in space with piece - wise parabolic fitting ( walters 1993 ) .",
    "this method allowed us to maintain good resolution in all parts of the grid by using zones of initially uniform spacing .",
    "it is well suited for cases in which the grid spans several orders of magnitude in density , such as the galactic atmosphere problem investigated in this paper .",
    "the code was otherwise similar to several others constructed in our group for the study of supernova remnants ( e.g. slavin & cox 1992 ; cui & cox 1992 ) , based on the methods of richtmyer & morton ( 1967 ) .",
    "several additional features of the code are worth mentioning .",
    "although this was a one fluid model , it allowed for the possibility of different electron and ion temperatures via the methods described in cui & cox ( 1992 ) and cox & anderson ( 1982 ) .",
    "it followed the ionization of hydrogen and helium explicitly , including collisional ionization , radiative recombination , and an additional low level of ionization ( and heating ) nominally due to cosmic rays .",
    "the code also followed the heating and cooling rates for each parcel ( with heating primarily due to compressions and shock waves ) . for hydrogen , cooling terms from bremsstrahlung , radiative recombination , and collisional excitation were computed explicitly .",
    "all other elements were assumed to radiate at their collisional equilibrium rates , using a rate table produced from the raymond and smith code ( raymond , cox , & smith 1976 ) with standard cosmic abundances . in order to avoid excessively low temperatures , all cooling except that due to recombination of hydrogen was turned off below 10@xmath2  k. electron thermal conduction was also included in the code .",
    "most of these features had little effect on the overall behavior of the atmosphere , but allowed for a more realistic study of the outer layers of the galactic disk .",
    "our model for the vertical distributions of density and pressure was similar to that of model a of martos & cox ( 1998 ) , based on the hydrostatic solution of boulares & cox ( 1990 ) .",
    "the density distribution consisted of the smoothed contributions from molecular and cold atomic clouds as well as the warm neutral and the warm ionized components .",
    "each component had its own total column density , scale height , and form of distribution .",
    "the total number density of nuclei was given by :    @xmath3 + 0.37\\exp \\left [ -\\frac{z^2}{2\\left ( 135\\textrm { pc } \\right ) ^2}\\right ] \\right\\ } \\textrm { cm}^{-3 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left\\ { 0.1\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{\\left| z\\right| } { 400\\textrm { pc}}\\right ) + 0.03\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{\\left| z\\right| } { 900\\textrm { pc}}\\right ) \\right\\ }   \\textrm { cm}^{-3 } .",
    "\\label{eqn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the gas consisted of hydrogen and helium atoms , in the ratio of 10:1 .",
    "( the presence of other elements was neglected when computing the bulk properties of the gas such as density and pressure . )",
    "the electron density was inferred from the density of nuclei and the ionization level . in the initialization ,",
    "a constant cosmic ray ionization rate was included which was sufficient to maintain 25% ionization of hydrogen at a @xmath0 distance of 5 kpc from the galactic plane ( assuming the equilibrium density at that height ) .",
    "we used the gravity given by bienaym , robin , & crz ( 1987 ) , as fit by martos & cox ( 1998 ) :    @xmath4 \\textrm { cm s}^{-2 } .",
    "\\label{eqn2}\\ ] ]    given the density and gravity distributions , one can derive the total pressure as a function of height , the result depending somewhat on the assumptions about the outer boundary .",
    "our assumption was that the density followed the form described above until the outer boundary was reached , at which point the pressure was taken as purely thermal and then integrated downward . beyond the boundary ,",
    "the density and pressure were taken to be zero , making the outer boundary a free surface .",
    "the location of the boundary was most often 5 kpc , but that height was varied somewhat for some of the experiments described later .",
    "( note : having the pressure drop rapidly to thermal near the outer boundary while the density remained finite had the effect of terminating the disk with a layer of low signal speed .",
    "however , this oddity at very high @xmath0 appears to have had little effect on the results of our experiments . )",
    "the pressure forms assumed for the calculation were thermal pressure and a pseudo - magnetic pressure .",
    "the thermal pressure was intended to include the internal dynamical pressures of the denser components , but not the large - scale motions actually being modeled .",
    "this was accomplished by assuming a constant temperature of 10@xmath2  k for all components of the static solution .",
    "there was no explicit inclusion of cosmic ray pressure , known to be a very important component ( boulares & cox 1990 ) .",
    "instead , the entire nonthermal pressure was represented by the pseudo - magnetic term .",
    "given the total pressure from the weight integration and the thermal pressure from the density , ionization , and temperature , the magnetic pressure was found by simple subtraction .",
    "our form for the equilibrium thermal pressure was : @xmath5 where @xmath6  is the ratio of the total number of particles to the number of atoms or nuclei .",
    "it then followed that the equilibrium magnetic field would be given by : @xmath7 } , \\label{eqn4}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the total initial pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) . when evolving the model over time , it was assumed that the magnetic field was parallel to the galactic plane and the flux was frozen in the flow , so that : @xmath9 in this equation , the functions @xmath10  and @xmath11  are the hydrostatic values for the lagrangian parcel initially located at @xmath12 , and now found at @xmath0 .",
    "we employed both one - sided and two - sided models of the atmosphere .",
    "the one - sided model was used for studying symmetric modes and wave propagation into the atmosphere . in this model ,",
    "the lower boundary represented the galactic midplane and was rigid , meaning that there was no inflow or outflow of gas .",
    "the two - sided model was used to study asymmetric modes of oscillation .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the equilibrium pressure , density , magnetic field , and ionization distributions of the two - sided hydrostatic model out to @xmath135 kpc .",
    "the one - sided atmosphere was the same except that it was limited to that shown in the right half of each graph ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we tested the hydrocode with several problems that have analytical solutions .",
    "one such problem was that of a piston moving at a constant speed down a 1-d tube containing a uniform medium . in this case",
    ", we found that the speed of the shock produced by the piston was in excellent agreement with theory , with differences usually less than 1% .",
    "our results were equally good when magnetic pressure was included in the calculation .",
    "another interesting test was to observe the growth of small waves as they propagated upward in our model atmosphere . using a one - sided disk",
    ", we oscillated the midplane boundary up and down sinusoidally with a very small amplitude .",
    "the amplitudes and positions of the extrema in velocity were tracked as they propagated , and the results were compared with the wkb approximation , which tells us that @xmath15  is constant vs. @xmath0 ( see appendix ) , where @xmath16  is the undisturbed density distribution , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  is the amplitude . in our case , the signal speed is given by @xmath19 .",
    "again , we found good agreement between theory and the results of our program .",
    "for example , one test case had oscillations with a period of 5 myr and an amplitude of 0.01 km s@xmath1  at the midplane . at this period ,",
    "the wavelengths are roughly one third of a scale height , and the behavior should not necessarily correspond precisely to the short wavelength limit .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the growth in amplitude closely approximated the wkb result .",
    "( the amplitudes grew by factors of 10 , 20 and about 60 at heights of 2 , 3.6 , and 5 kpc . )",
    "however , there was a small asymmetry between the positive and negative velocities that appeared to decrease with the passage of successive waves .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our investigation ( via numerical experiments ) into the normal modes of vertical oscillation of our model ism .",
    "we attempted to find these modes , along with the corresponding resonant frequencies , by introducing a large disturbance into our model ism .",
    "we succeeded in discovering both antisymmetric modes ( which we call sloshing modes , for reasons discussed later ) and symmetric ( breathing ) modes .",
    "we found two distinct frequencies for each type , and also discovered how those frequencies depend on the assumed height of our outer boundary .",
    "for comparison , we undertook a separate linear normal modes analysis ( see appendix ) assuming a pressure node at the top of the atmosphere , and found almost exactly the same frequencies as reported below from the numerical experiments .",
    "our interest in these frequencies arises from the hypothesis that resonances between the vertical modes and spiral density waves might lead to reinforcement of particular patterns within the arms , as suggested in martos & cox ( 1998 ) .",
    "this could produce substructure in the spiral arms , such as feathering , spurs , or `` beads on a string . ''",
    "in addition to the periods of normal modes , we also examined the response of the ism to a large expansive event , provoked by an initial strong compression of the central portion of the disk .",
    "we explored the time required for the gas to bounce from one compressed state to the next as a function of the strength of the event and of the distance from the midplane .",
    "the motivation was similar , to understand this characteristic bounce time as a possible indicator of the distance between compressed regions along the length of a spiral arm , or between the arms themselves .",
    "it also gives an idea of the recovery time of the disk after any major perturbation , such as impact by a high velocity cloud .      in our search for antisymmetric modes ,",
    "the entire two - sided atmosphere was initialized as if it were in hydrostatic equilibrium , then shifted in height by a constant amount and released . for our first simulation , we chose an offset of 100 pc and atmospheric boundaries at @xmath133 kpc .",
    "our program keeps track of the properties of certain designated parcels , chosen to show what different regions of the atmosphere are doing . as a rule ,",
    "the parcels examined have equilibrium heights ( before the displacement ) of @xmath12  = 0 , 10% , 20% , 50% , and 100% of the upper boundary height ( i.e. the top of the atmosphere , @xmath20 ) . in the results",
    "below , we show the locations of these parcels upper boundaries versus time .",
    "we also followed changes in the total energy in the grid .",
    "these results were then fourier transformed to find the periods of oscillation .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the history of the locations of these tracer parcels over the course of a 3 billion year simulation . as the atmosphere oscillates vertically",
    ", the motions of the individual parcels appear to be sinusoidal with beats of roughly five oscillations each , implying the superposition of two frequencies differing by about 20% .",
    "note also that the modulation due to the beats is relatively small for the parcels at intermediate distances from the midplane , implying that one of the frequencies has a node in the displacement in that vicinity .",
    "this is just what would be expected for a mixture of the fundamental antisymmetric mode and its first overtone .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation is quite large at the midplane and the upper boundary , requiring comparable wave amplitudes there .",
    "the midplane is a displacement anti - node for both frequencies .",
    "the outer boundary is a pressure node , corresponding to a velocity and displacement anti - node .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig2 ] is the history of the total energy ( per unit area ) in the grid .",
    "note that this is the total energy of _ both _ sides of the atmosphere .",
    "the oscillations in this plot arise from the weak heating term that acts when expansion cools the gas below 10@xmath2  k. because this happens with opposite phase on the two sides , the oscillations in energy have twice the frequency of those in displacement .",
    "we performed fourier transforms on these histories , using the algorithm given by press et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . to determine the periods accurately",
    ", we eliminated the early complications of the transient response by examining only the last 2 billion years of the simulation .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the power spectra resulting from the fourier analysis .",
    "as expected , they are dominated by two large peaks separated by about 20% in frequency .",
    "the corresponding periods are 117.6 and 93.0 myr , independent of height above the midplane .",
    "( for comparison , the periods from our linear normal mode analysis are 118.5 and 93 myr . )",
    "note that the relative amplitude of the higher frequency peak is low for tracer parcels at intermediate distances from the plane , in agreement with the expectation that it has a node in that vicinity .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] illustrates the structure in the atmosphere at 1.5 , 2.0 , and 2.5 billion years .",
    "the `` sloshing '' back and forth ( across the midplane ) is evident , though complicated by the contribution from the second mode that tends to move material at high @xmath0 opposite in direction from that at low @xmath0 . this sloshing motion ( which is why we call this the sloshing mode )",
    "can be seen by observing changes in the pressure distribution between the three times . in a linear approximation",
    ", the velocity distributions would be entirely symmetric , with the velocity of the center occasionally opposite in direction from that at great distances from the plane , depending on the amplitudes and phases of the two modes .",
    "for the particular times shown , the velocities are everywhere of the same sign ( an accident of the phasing ) , but there is an obvious lack of complete symmetry in the velocity field",
    ". this asymmetry could be due to any of several factors : the anticipated symmetry is with respect to the unperturbed positions of the parcels ; the flow includes the full nonlinearities which should be most significant far from the plane where the velocities are large ; and the power spectrum shows very weak features at other frequencies that may include contributions excited at the opposite symmetry through round - off errors or asymmetries in the code . in spite of these complications , however , the atmosphere oscillates at moderate amplitude at just those frequencies expected from the linear analysis .",
    "in addition , the oscillations persist for an extremely long time .    repeating this simulation using atmospheres with various maximum heights , @xmath21 , ranging from 1 to 5 kpc",
    ", we found that the periods increase as the height increases , still in excellent agreement with the linear analysis .",
    "the results are shown as the two solid lines in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "note that while the height of the atmosphere increases from 1 to 5 kpc , the period of the fundamental mode goes from 104 to 133.3 myr , an increase of only 30% .",
    "in fact , our linear analysis tells us that the period should approach an asymptotic value as @xmath21 increases , as the forces inversely proportional to the wavelength squared fade in importance relative to those inversely proportional to the scale height squared .      to excite modes that are symmetric about the galactic midplane , we initialized the model with a symmetric compression of the lower atmosphere , reminiscent of the compression observed in spiral arms .",
    "in the first experiment , all parcels within 500 pc of the midplane in equilibrium were compressed by a factor of 1.5 , so that their heights decreased and their densities increased by a factor of 1.5 . above ( or below ) this compressed layer , all of the parcels retained their equilibrium properties , although they were shifted downward ( or upward ) due to the smaller thickness of the compressed layer . for comparison with our previous simulation",
    ", we again chose an initial boundary height for the atmosphere of 3 kpc .",
    "the results for a 3 billion year run are shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "again there is periodic motion with amplitude modulation .",
    "the fourier transforms of these histories are shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "notice that in this case not all parcels have the same oscillation frequencies .",
    "the motion of the galactic midplane ( @xmath22 ) corresponds to periods of 117.6 and 93.0 myr , just those of our previous asymmetric disturbance .",
    "however the rest of the parcels and the energy show periods of 109.6 and 70.2 myr ( compared with 109.5 and 69.5 myr for the two lowest symmetric modes from the linear analysis ) . and",
    "once again , the relative amplitude of the higher frequency component is low at intermediate heights , close to its node .",
    "ideally , one would expect the midplane to remain perfectly still in this experiment , but we find that a very slight amount of sloshing has been excited , which is probably due to round - off errors .",
    "these oscillations are much , much smaller than any of the other oscillations , and are only visible because the midplane is a velocity node for all symmetric modes .",
    "any spurious sloshing mode frequencies are totally invisible ( below noise level ) in the oscillation spectra taken at other heights .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the structure of the atmosphere at 1 , 2 , and 3 gyr .",
    "as expected the density , pressure , and temperature distributions are symmetric about the midplane , while the velocity profiles are antisymmetric .",
    "the velocity profiles at 1 and 3 gyr show the entire disk ( both above and below the midplane ) to be either expanding or contracting , in other words `` breathing . ''",
    "however , at 2 gyr the motion changes from expansion to contraction at about 2.3 kpc off the plane , revealing the presence of the overtone .",
    "repeating the simulation using several different boundary heights for the atmosphere , as we did in the previous section , yielded the results shown as dotted lines in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] in fact illustrates all of the anticipated characteristics of normal modes .",
    "the longest period belongs to the sloshing mode with no displacement nodes .",
    "from there , the periods decrease with increasing node number , alternating between symmetric ( breathing ) and antisymmetric ( sloshing ) forms .",
    "the periods also increase gradually with increasing atmospheric thickness , the specific rate depending on the detailed structure of the atmosphere and in particular the @xmath0 dependences of gravity , density , and the signal speed .",
    "as @xmath20 goes to infinity , these periods should approach asymptotic values .",
    "a final experiment was performed to excite both sloshing and breathing modes with comparable amplitudes for an atmosphere with boundaries at @xmath132.5 kpc . in this setup",
    ", a one - sided expansion was initialized by imposing a uniform velocity gradient equal to 25 km s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1  on the upper half of the atmosphere ( @xmath14 ) and leaving the other half ( initially ) at rest .",
    "the resulting oscillations of the tracer parcels are shown in figure [ fig9 ] . in the fourier analysis of these motions , shown in figure [ fig10 ] , this modulation pattern is found to correspond to periods of 114.3 and 102.6 myr .",
    "the 114.3 myr mode is exactly that of the first sloshing mode for an atmosphere of this height , while the shorter period is very close to the 103.9 myr value for the first breathing mode .",
    "( the linear analysis yielded 114.7 and 103 myr , respectively . )",
    "the midplane , which is a displacement node for the breathing modes , shows no beats and its spectrum contains only the longer period .",
    "the amplitude modulation shown in figure [ fig9 ] increases monotonically with height until it is 100% at the outer boundary .",
    "this is reflected in figure [ fig10 ] as an increase in the higher frequency component until the two are equal at the outer boundary .",
    "comparison of figures [ fig2 ] , [ fig6 ] , and [ fig9 ] shows that our experiments regularly produced large amplitude modulation at the outer boundary .",
    "we do not know whether this is due to an accident of the initializations , nonlinearities in the early more dramatic motions , or a natural property of this atmosphere .",
    "note also that all experiments led to spectra dominated by only two frequencies . in the mixed mode experiment",
    ", we did not obtain all four of the previous frequencies , only the two lowest ones .",
    "this pair of curiosities may indicate something fundamental about how the atmosphere responds to major disturbances .",
    "in the previous section , we were only interested in the long - term behavior of the atmosphere , disregarding the atmosphere s initial ( transient ) response to disturbances .",
    "as indicated previously , the initial response to the disturbance is also of interest and we examine that next .    in the experiments on symmetric modes , one of our simulations had a compression factor of 1.5 , a total atmosphere height of 5 kpc , and a run time of 3 gyr .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the tracking of our tracer parcels for the first 1 gyr of this simulation .",
    "when the parcels first rebound from the compression imposed on them , they are propelled to relatively large heights .",
    "they then fall back toward the midplane , slowing down only as they come close to their equilibrium positions .",
    "oscillations subsequent to this first bounce are smaller and rapidly approach the periodic pattern discussed previously .",
    "the parcels very close to the outer boundary require more than one bounce to settle .",
    "the midplane oscillation amplitude should in principle be zero , but in actuality has a small asymmetric component .",
    "all other regions seem to settle after only one return .",
    "a more detailed view of these transients can be seen in figure [ fig12 ] , which shows the first 250 myr of this simulation .",
    "note that for this illustration , the simulation has been redone with the first tracer parcel set at 5% of the peak height of the atmosphere , rather than at the nearly stationary midplane .",
    "we repeated the experiment for a range of initial compression factors and two different boundary heights ( 5 kpc and 3 kpc ) . defining the bounce time , @xmath23 , for a parcel as the time from the beginning of the experiment to time of its next minimum in height , the results for the atmosphere with the 5 kpc boundary height are shown in figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig14 ] , the bounce times for the parcels of the inner disk depend very little on compression factor , which is a measure of the strength of the disturbance .",
    "there is a slight decrease in bounce times with increasing compression factor , perhaps because these parcels return more rapidly when they hit the upper atmosphere harder .",
    "also , these times are only weakly dependent on the equilibrium heights of the parcels , with a slight linear gradient that arises from the flattening of gravity and the increase in the amplitude of the disturbance with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , parcels very high in the atmosphere have significantly longer bounce times , which is partly due to the longer time it takes the initial disturbance to reach them , partly to the nearly constant gravity there , and partly to the rapid growth in the amplitude of the disturbance with @xmath0 .",
    "they also take progressively longer to return with increasing compression factor .",
    "much the same behavior is found when the boundary height is reduced to 3 kpc , though the initial decrease in bounce time with increasing compression factor for parcels near the plane is more pronounced . the overall result for moderate strength disturbances and",
    "either boundary height is that the bounce times near the plane are about 40 myr , increasing slowly with parcel height by roughly 20 myr kpc@xmath1 . for weaker disturbances ,",
    "the bounce time is somewhat longer , closer to the half period of the first symmetric mode , but increases more slowly with height . on the whole , bounce times for material near the midplane lie between 40 and 50 myr , increasing to about 70 myr for material 1.5 kpc off the plane , and to much longer times for the outer boundary .",
    "a fundamental consequence of these results is explored in the next section , but a discussion of additional possible significance is deferred to the conclusions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , spitzer & fitzpatrick ( 1993 ) have observed the uv absorption spectrum of the galactic halo star hd 93521 , identifying at least nine separate velocity components that they interpret as interstellar clouds .",
    "these components congregate in two velocity regions , one approximately stationary and the other moving towards the midplane at roughly 50 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this general structuring is typical of roughly half of the northern sky , which is covered by the iv arch .",
    "the numerical experiments in this section are designed to show how a large disturbance in the galactic atmosphere can naturally create such velocity segregation , and that small velocity perturbations can produce the multiple velocity components seen without any actual clouds ( via velocity crowding , i.e. caustics in the velocity field ) .",
    "as explored in the previous section , material may move away from the plane following a large disturbance within the disk , returning after a characteristic bounce time .",
    "but , because that return time increases with height , material nearer the plane falls back sooner and accumulates near the midplane at low velocity , with material further up continuing to rain down upon it .",
    "if the velocities involved are large , the infalling outer atmosphere will be bounded on the bottom by a shock between it and the already decelerated material close to the plane .",
    "owing to the considerable density gradient in the infalling material , the spectrum during such infall will show two fairly sharp velocity components , one at low velocity due to the nearly stationary material near the disk , and one at an `` intermediate '' negative velocity due to the material just about to pass through the shock .",
    "( for smaller disturbances with lower velocities and no shock , the second feature will appear at the extremum velocity of the infall as it just begins to slow . )",
    "thus , the observed velocity segregation is a natural consequence of a large disturbance and should be found at a time roughly equal to the return time for material a few hundred parsecs off the plane , which from our previous discussion is expected to be 50 to 60 myr , depending on the thickness of the disk .    in our experiment to explore this phenomenon",
    ", we initialized the program with the two - sided equilibrium atmosphere .",
    "a velocity profile was then imposed such that the whole atmosphere was expanding .",
    "the velocity rose / dropped linearly from @xmath24  at @xmath25  to a maximum / minimum of @xmath26  km s@xmath1  at @xmath27  kpc . for @xmath28  kpc , the velocity was constant at @xmath29  km s@xmath1 .",
    "the equilibrium height of the atmosphere s boundary was 5 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig18 ] illustrates the evolution of one side of this symmetric model , showing the density and velocity profiles at several times .",
    "also shown is the predicted differential column density vs. velocity ( i.e. the velocity spectrum ) that would be seen in the northern sky by an observer at the midplane .",
    "for comparison with hd 93521 , we integrate the column density out to 1.5 kpc , the approximate distance to that star .",
    "we also use a lower limit of 235 pc for the integration to account for the presence of the local interstellar cavity .",
    "this particular limit was chosen to make the total column density equal to 1.25@xmath3010@xmath31  @xmath32 , at least initially , which is the value observed in that direction .",
    "the solid line in the left column of figure [ fig18 ] illustrates the initialization .",
    "the absence of the lowest velocities in the spectrum is due to the lower limit of the integration ( at 235 pc ) .",
    "the dotted line , 20 myr later , shows the substantial amount of expansion involved , and that a significant amount of material close to the plane has reached zero velocity .",
    "the dashed line at 40 myr shows that the velocities have reversed out to about 3 kpc .",
    "the spectrum at that time has a peak at the extremum of negative velocity , and again has a hole at zero velocity due to the lower integration limit .",
    "the right column of figure [ fig18 ] shows times of 50 , 55 , and 60 myr , during which a region of nearly zero velocity expands out to about 1 kpc from the midplane . outside this region",
    "there is substantial infall . as time progresses , the velocity of infall increases , while the column density of infalling material decreases . at the latest time shown , the structure is forming a shock which appears as an abrupt change in the velocity and as a step in the density profile .",
    "( note also that the density profile interior to the shock differs very little from the equilibrium distribution . ) at later times the shock strengthens and passes out through the atmosphere .",
    "this shock substantially heats the tenuous outer parts of the atmosphere ( a subject we will return to in the next section ) and drives it back into expansion , leading to the subsequent smaller amplitude oscillations explored in the previous sections .",
    "figure [ fig19 ] provides an enlarged view of the velocity spectrum at 55 myr .",
    "the solid line is the actual spectrum , with strong peaks near -3 and -48 km s@xmath1 ; the dotted and dashed lines show convolutions with the thermal profiles for oxygen and hydrogen , respectively .",
    "the synthetic spectrum for hydrogen closely resembles the 21 cm observations for many regions in the northern sky in the general direction of the iv arch ( danly et al .",
    "1992 ) , in particular that shown by spitzer & fitzpatrick ( 1993 ) in the direction of hd 93521 , reprinted as figure [ fig20 ] .",
    "the details of these spectral results depend somewhat on the initial form of the disturbance . roughly speaking ,",
    "a steeper initial gradient promotes more mass to higher velocity .",
    "this results in a larger column density in the infalling component when it is centered at a given velocity , or a higher infall velocity for a given column density in the infalling component .",
    "our initialization was selected to produce comparable column densities in the two components when the infalling component had a speed of roughly 50 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the bi - modal velocity distribution observed in the northern sky can be produced by vertical motions in the galaxy .",
    "next , we show how features resembling clouds can be produced . in the previous section , we initialized our model with a velocity profile which has a uniform gradient near the midplane and is flat away from the midplane .",
    "but the interstellar medium has a considerable amount of velocity structure on scales of a few kilometers per second , which needs to be included for a more realistic assessment of the anticipated spectrum . rather than trying to introduce these small - scale structures in the initialization , however , we chose to produce them by mechanical disturbances at the midplane , which then propagated into the outer disk as waves .",
    "the experiment in this section had exactly the same initial configuration as that in the previous section , with one important difference .",
    "to produce small waves , we applied a small sinusoidal motion to the midplane boundary .",
    "the period for these oscillations was 10 myr and the velocity amplitude was 5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "there were no waves present prior to the beginning of the expansion .",
    "although this method does not reproduce the randomness of interstellar turbulence , it nevertheless provides disturbances of the about the right amplitude and spacing .",
    "it also gives us a clear example to illustrate our point about caustics .",
    "figure [ fig22 ] illustrates the evolution of this model . comparing this to figure [ fig18 ]",
    ", one can see that the behavior of the atmosphere as a whole is very similar to the case without waves .",
    "the waves are of such low amplitude that there is scarcely any density or pressure variation visible , but they can be seen as small wiggles in the velocity profile near the midplane , moving outward with time ( until they are swept back by the infall ) . at late times",
    ", these variations also appear as small inclined steps in the density plot . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect on the velocity spectrum is quite pronounced , even at early times . at later times",
    "we can discern at least 5 separate peaks , as can be seen in the spectrum at 55 myr shown in figure [ fig23 ] .",
    "these additional components arise from the convolution of the monotonic density profile with the steps introduced into the velocity structure by the small amplitude waves .",
    "the number of such steps increases with the oscillation frequency , but at a significantly higher frequency they would smear together to return to a nearly smooth distribution . in this particular experiment ,",
    "only 5 oscillations have occurred by the time the infall has reached the desired state , and they have not quite managed to propagate as far as the velocity minimum .",
    "had there been waves in the experiment prior to the expansion , there might have been even more high velocity components .",
    "comparing the spectrum of figure [ fig23 ] with the 21 cm profile and uv components toward hd 93521 , shown in figure [ fig20 ] , there are several qualitative similarities .",
    "both show two large concentrations of mass in velocity space : one near 0 km s@xmath1 and the other near -50 km s@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , each of these broad features consists of multiple components .",
    "the inclusion of thermal broadening for hydrogen ( dashed line ) , however , obliterates the small scale structure , making the spectrum into a pair of bell - shaped features .",
    "this is very much like the observed profile of figure [ fig20 ] , the only significant difference being that the latter contains a single much cooler component with low broadening .",
    "thus the combination of the increasing bounce times with increasing @xmath0 and the presence of small amplitude waves ( or , more realistically , the observed random motions ) in the interstellar medium naturally produces a spectrum with the form and complexity of that of hd 93521 , but with no density maxima actually associated with the velocity features !",
    "our model includes no clouds whatsoever .",
    "all it requires is that our region of the galaxy have undergone a substantial amount of vertical expansion roughly 50 myr ago in order to produce the downfalling iv arch that is presently observed over roughly half of the northern sky .",
    "one caveat to our model is that the distribution of material in the iv arch is observed to have column density variations from direction to direction over the sky , almost surely implying that there are density concentrations within it",
    ". it would be difficult to imagine that its return to the plane of the galaxy would not have led to density structuring , even if it were not already present .",
    "however , velocity structuring within the ism is just as real and should frequently contribute to features in the spectra in low column density directions .",
    "the fact that one feature in the spectrum of hd 93521 is noticeably cooler than all the others suggests that it might be the one real cloud seen in the spectrum , the others being due to velocity crowding in the diffuse intercloud component .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these results are not peculiar to a one - dimensional model .",
    "martos has conducted similar eexperiments in two dimensions , and has achieved similar results ( personal communication ; see also fig . 16 in martos & cox 1993 ) .",
    "as described in section [ hydrostatic ] , our equilibrium atmosphere terminates at its outer boundary with a sharp cutoff in density , with material just interior to the boundary having a temperature of 10@xmath2  k. this is an unrealistic termination but was meant to be one that included no bias concerning what actually occurs there .",
    "our intent was to investigate what does happen there , keeping in mind the hypothesis of sciama ( 1972 ) .",
    "he suggested that the galactic atmosphere should pass through a chromospheric state far off the plane and have a high temperature corona beyond that .",
    "this transition could be produced by a variety of influences including the dissipation of mechanical energy arriving from below , the eventual significance of cosmic ray heating at very low densities , heating due to flare - like activity , or dissipation of infall energy .    in this final set of experiments ,",
    "we have explored how outward fluxes of mechanical energy ( like those invoked in our earlier experiments ) restructure the outer parts of the atmosphere , moving it away from our initially assumed equilibrium .",
    "the basic result is that when the disturbance produces a strong shock , or a series of shocks that are not too far apart , there is a sudden transition at some height to a much higher temperature regime .",
    "when the disturbance leads to a only a single strong shock , its passage generates a hot outer layer which then eventually cools back to the initial equilibrium .",
    "however , the cooling time is extremely long owing to the low densities , and is longer still if the temperature rises beyond the peak in the cooling curve . for small periodic perturbations ,",
    "a `` hot halo '' can be built up by the successive passage of many waves or shocks .",
    "also , there is a significant resonance at which the halo produced is hotter and more distended than it is otherwise .",
    "the power required in the waves to maintain an appreciable hot halo is extremely small .    as a first example",
    ", we return to the simulation from the previous section that has an expanding atmosphere with a maximum velocity of 60 km s@xmath1 .",
    "it produces a large segregation in velocity after @xmath33 50 myr , with an outward facing shock whose velocity jump approaches the original expansion speed , 60 km s@xmath1 . following this simulation for a much longer time",
    ", we see that the shock moves outward through the infalling material , remaining radiative but generating long lived ionization until it reaches a region of the atmosphere with sufficiently low density that the cooling time exceeds the shock transit time through the remainder of the atmosphere .",
    "the material heated during that final phase is the transient hot halo in this case .",
    "subsequently , the inner denser parts of the halo cool faster than the outer regions",
    ". both the amount of material remaining hot and the temperature of the hot material gradually decrease over time .",
    "this description is complicated slightly by the further reverberations of the atmosphere , which send additional weaker shocks into the halo .",
    "these effects are illustrated in figure [ fig24 ] , which shows the density , temperature , and ionization structure of the model at very late times : 400 and 600 myr after the start of the simulation .",
    "the sudden drop in density and rise in temperature at height of 5 kpc ( the nominal boundary height ) are apparent .",
    "the temperature in the halo is roughly 10@xmath34  k , decreasing with time .",
    "note , however , that the halo persists for hundreds of millions of years .",
    "the density in the halo is roughly 10@xmath35  @xmath36 , at which the anticipated cooling time is consistently expected to be around 500 myr .",
    "next we examined the effect a series of small waves or perturbations , with particular interest in what would happen at the resonant frequencies found in section  [ large ] . in this set of experiments",
    ", we considered a one - sided atmosphere with an outer boundary initially at 5 kpc .",
    "we forced the midplane to oscillate with a velocity amplitude of 2 km s@xmath1 and explored a range of oscillation periods between 100 to 150 myr , which includes the lowest frequency resonant modes ( which have periods of 129 and 133 myr for this atmosphere ) .",
    "the perturbations were made small enough so that an individual oscillation would not cause a dramatic change in the atmosphere , but would still be on the scale of the velocity dispersion of the interstellar medium . in each case , we followed the evolution for 3 gyr , and the structures discussed below are those at the end of that time .",
    "figure [ fig25 ] shows the final structure of the atmosphere for an oscillation period of 100 myr ( relatively far from the resonances ) , as well as the net change in energy in the atmosphere during the evolution .",
    "a hot ionized halo with a temperature rising to roughly 2.5@xmath3010@xmath34  k has formed above the cool disk boundary .",
    "the density in the halo drops from @xmath37  to @xmath38  @xmath36  over the range 5.3 to 6.4 kpc .",
    "examining the structure at other times , we found that this hot layer remains approximately constant in size , position , and temperature .",
    "the atmosphere has therefore reached a new equilibrium state in response to the energy input from the oscillations .",
    "this can also be seen by looking at the net total energy in the atmosphere vs. time , shown in the lower right graph in figure [ fig25 ] .",
    "the large oscillations are just the insertion and removal of @xmath39 work as the lower boundary pushes and pulls against the midplane pressure .",
    "if one looks past these oscillations for an overall trend , one can see that the average energy is nearly constant .    for an oscillation period of 133 myr , the first sloshing mode resonance found in section  [ large ] , we again find a hot halo , similar to but slightly hotter than in the previous experiment .",
    "interestingly , the envelope of the energy curve appears to oscillate in this case , suggesting that the driving frequency may be beating against a nearby resonance .",
    "figure [ fig27 ] shows the results for a period of 129 myr , the first breathing mode resonance .",
    "they are dramatically different from the previous cases .",
    "the halo has become very distended , extending from 4 to 20 kpc , and is significantly hotter , with a temperature of 10@xmath40 k. the lower right panel shows the time evolution of the net energy per unit area , relative to the initial equilibrium state . in this case , the mean total energy has a significant increase , rising by about 2@xmath3010@xmath41 erg @xmath32  over the 3 gyr run .",
    "interestingly , the average energy seems to level off after 1.5 gyr , but then turns up again near the end .",
    "the results for 133 and 129 myr are remarkably different for having been produced by only a relatively small shift in period .",
    "both cases used resonant frequencies for the unperturbed atmosphere , but those frequencies may not correspond exactly to resonances in the new atmosphere with its lowered boundary for the cool gas and its hot outer layer . in order to explore the possibility that there might actually be a strong resonance for hot gas generation , suggested by the great differences between these two results , we explored a wide range of driving periods .",
    "figure [ fig28 ] illustrates the change in the mean energy column density over 3 gyr runs for a wide range of periods of oscillation of the midplane .",
    "the mean energy is taken as the average of the maximum and minimum in one cycle , and the change as the difference between the values for the first and last full cycles in the simulation .",
    "the curve shows a strong resonance with peak response at 127 myr .",
    "( a quick investigation for smaller periods revealed the presence of additional resonances in the neighborhoods of 60 and 80 myr . )    the simulation using the peak period of 127 myr is shown in figure [ fig29 ] .",
    "the hot halo is even more dramatic than for the 129 myr case .",
    "the temperature now jumps up sharply and continues to rise , reaching 2@xmath4210@xmath40 k. because material formerly in the cool part of the atmosphere has been promoted into the halo , supplying a density in excess of @xmath38  @xmath36  out to 11 kpc , the boundary between the two regimes has retreated downward slightly . in this case , the average energy does not level off , but continues to increase and even to increase in rate toward the end of the run , possibly due to a decrease in the radiative losses of the hot gas as it is heated further .",
    "let us now consider the power involved in generating this remarkable structure .",
    "the only input into the model comes from the ( sound ) waves generated by the midplane , which acts like a piston .",
    "if the midplane were a source of ordinary outward moving sound waves then the average power per unit area , or intensity @xmath43 , would be : @xmath44 we have used the initial midplane values for the density ( @xmath45 ) and signal speed ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that this result does not depend on the period of the piston motion , given the constant velocity amplitude . in equilibrium",
    "there are nearly equal amounts of power propagating upward and downward , so the above estimate is an extreme upper limit . in reality , the pressure and velocity variations are nearly a quarter period out of phase , making their product average to a much smaller value .",
    "the difference between the amounts of upward and downward propagating power must be just that delivered to the halo across the upper boundary .",
    "if that power is all outgoing , the corresponding result should be : @xmath47 where the next to the last step is taken from the results of our normal mode analysis and is very approximate .",
    "quantities with subscript _ hot _ are evaluated at the lower boundary of the hot region .",
    "this result differs from our upper limit in eq .",
    "[ eqn6 ] by approximately the ratio of the signal speed at the midplane to that in the halo . for comparison ,",
    "the power per unit area actually retained by the atmosphere during the simulation ( after losses due to radiation by the halo , which we estimate to be comparable ) is : @xmath48    let us compare this with the amount of power released into the galaxy from supernovae and spiral arm disturbances . if there is one supernova of energy 10@xmath49 ergs every 100 years , the average power input into the upper half ( @xmath50 ) of the galaxy ( assuming a radius of 10 kpc ) is roughly : @xmath51 this is several orders of magnitude greater than the power input of our perturbations , though it is certainly not provided coherently , or at the resonant frequency .",
    "however spiral wave disturbances , occurring with a period of perhaps 120 myr , put at least 3@xmath3010@xmath52  ergs per atom into compression , in a column density of order 3@xmath3010@xmath31  @xmath32per side .",
    "the corresponding average power density per side is roughly : @xmath53 which is four times the nominal power of our waves in equation [ eqn6 ] and sixty times that actually transmitted into our most extreme halo .",
    "therefore the energy requirement for the resonant production of a hot , ionized halo above 5 kpc is quite small compared to the energy potentially available .",
    "the essentially resonant spiral arm period chosen above corresponds to a four arm spiral at the solar circle , with a differential speed between gas and pattern of 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we found several potentially important properties of the interstellar medium in our experiments .",
    "probably the most intriguing of these is that segregation of infalling material into two dominant components occurs naturally after any large expansive event in the ism as a whole .",
    "the material closest to the midplane returns first and stops . after roughly 50 myr a substantial low velocity column density has collected , with outer material continuing to fall in upon it . with a sufficiently large velocity differential ,",
    "the two components are separated by a nearly stationary shock . the large structure known as the iv arch , covering about half of the northern sky ,",
    "could well be the consequence of such a process .",
    "the concentration of material in velocity space ( rather than in real space ) is a natural occurrence in the ism , and can easily lead to apparent structures in the diffuse gas which mimic low - density clouds .",
    "experiments in which we added small velocity perturbations ( via oscillation of the galactic midplane ) to cases in which a velocity segregated infall was already present ( from a general expansion , as above ) provided velocity spectra closely resembling those of hd 93521 , even though there were no density concentrations , i.e. clouds , whatsoever .",
    "we suggest that perhaps only the one colder component in the spectrum of that star is actually a localized density feature .",
    "we found the periods of the four lowest normal modes for our model ism as functions of the height of the outer boundary , both through fourier analysis of the oscillations in the aftermath of a major perturbation , and via linear analysis , with the two methods giving remarkably similar results .",
    "our hydrodynamics experiments further revealed two curious tendencies : first that the oscillating structure appears to concentrate energy into two modes , which two depending on the nature of the initial perturbation ; and second that the relative amplitudes of the two modes are comparable at the outer boundary , which therefore shows substantial amplitude modulation in the beat pattern .",
    "we also explored a timescale that we refer to as the bounce time .",
    "starting with a large compression of material near the midplane , the bounce time at a given height is the length of time for the material to return to its next minimum height . for material in the general vicinity of the plane ,",
    "the bounce time tended to lie between the half period of the lowest frequency breathing mode and the half period of the first overtone , depending on the magnitude of the initial compression , and therefore perhaps on the relative amplitudes of the excited modes . in general , the bounce time for material near the plane lay in the range 40 to 60 myr , while material beyond 1.5 kpc took substantially longer to return .",
    "it is this characteristic difference that leads to the velocity segregation discussed above .",
    "it is our impression that the approximate equality between the bounce time and the half period of the most strongly excited breathing mode derives from the fact that the amplitude is very nonlinear in the initial and secondary compressions , with the result that very little time is spent in the compressed state .",
    "most of the bounce time is spent in the expanded state , which lasts roughly half the period of the oscillation itself .    for atmospheric boundary heights , @xmath54 ,",
    "in the range 2 to 4 kpc , we found the periods of the fundamental breathing mode to be between 100 and 120 myr , and bounce times to be about half those values .",
    "following martos & cox ( 1998 ) , we should then expect to find dense structures within or along spiral arms , separated in space by distances proportional to relative velocity and timescales of 50 to 60 myr , as the disturbed structure bounces . with a relative velocity within the arm of 20 km s@xmath1",
    ", the spacing would be roughly 1 kpc . with an average relative speed between the pattern and rotation of 100 km s@xmath1",
    ", the scale would be 5 - 6 kpc . if the first overtone in the breathing mode is excited , the half periods drop to the range of 30 to 40 myr , and the characteristic feature spacings for the assumed velocities reduce to 0.6 - 0.8 kpc and 3 - 4 kpc ( for relative speeds of 20 km s@xmath1 and 100 km s@xmath1 , respectively ) . for comparison ,",
    "the circumference at the solar circle is roughly 50 kpc , and the timescale for material to circumnavigate it , relative to the pattern , is of order 500 myr . with a bounce timescale of roughly one tenth",
    "that , one might expect to encounter roughly ten unusually dense regions around the circle , some spaced closer than 1 kpc ( feathers ? ) with others several kpc apart along the circle ( arms and spurs ? ) .",
    "if the full oscillations of the normal modes ( rather than strong bounces ) are responsible for the structuring , the feature separations will be roughly twice these , their number on the solar circle reduced to roughly four or five , possibly reinforcing a four arm spiral .",
    "whether these expectations are borne out in some form by 3-dimensional modeling of the arm pattern remains to be seen .",
    "some alteration is expected as waves which are not entirely vertical will have somewhat different periods and finite wavelengths parallel to the plane .",
    "the basic idea , however , is that the spiral arm `` shock '' is fragmented , feeding energy preferentially into over dense regions resulting from waves provoked by other spiral arm fragments upstream ( and slightly off to the side ) . that energy input drives further oscillations to provide dense regions further downstream yet , where the next shock fragments occur .",
    "as these shock fragments are not oriented parallel to the arm locus , significantly stronger interactions can occur than if their strength were determined only by the component of the entry velocity normal to that more oblique locus .",
    "an individual large disturbance in the disk leads eventually to a shock wave propagating up into the low - density outer parts of the atmosphere .",
    "this shock strengthens as it proceeds , finally reaching such low density that it is no longer radiative on the timescale for propagating through the rest of the atmosphere .",
    "a hot low - density layer is produced , on top of the cool disk material . with no further disturbance",
    ", this layer slowly cools and rejoins the disk , but the timescale is extraordinarily long .",
    "if the time between such disturbances is longer than this cooling timescale , then the hot halo may become a more or less permanent feature of the atmosphere .",
    "similarly , when low amplitude waves are generated continuously within the disk and propagate into its outer reaches , they too can heat an outer layer to high temperatures , eventually reaching a new equilibrium with the unreflected portion of the wave power .",
    "we found that there is a strong resonance at which the temperature and size of the outer layer are greatly enhanced , leading to temperatures in excess of 10@xmath40  k and a thickness of many kiloparsecs . in our experiments ,",
    "the period of the resonance was that of the fundamental breathing mode for the slightly altered disk , essentially the same oscillation invoked to provide structuring in the spiral arm pattern .",
    "it appears that the two situations are linked .",
    "if the spiral waves are sufficiently large in amplitude to cause substantial vertical motion in rebounding from their compressions , vertical bounces and subsequent oscillations will be produced that can both structure the details of the arms themselves and lead to substantial heating of material at the outer disk .",
    "the latter effect produces a large and very hot gas layer , potentially contributing to the populations of high stage ions ( o  vi in particular ) and to the soft x - ray background .",
    "the details of the hot halo depend on the flux of driving mechanical energy , but quite an impressive halo was formed in our simulation with a very small power , on the order of 4@xmath3010@xmath55  erg @xmath32 s@xmath1 , which is less that 2% of that available from spiral wave disturbances .",
    "our experiments on hot halo formation were all performed with a nominal disk boundary height of 5 kpc .",
    "the resulting haloes have very low densities , with thermal pressures more than two orders of magnitude below the total midplane pressure .",
    "we estimate that their o  vi column densities would be of order 10@xmath56  @xmath32 . with a lower boundary height , the halo pressure and o  vi column densities could be significantly higher , though much more power would be required to sustain them .",
    "surely the details of these results will change when the studies are repeated in two and three dimensions , when mhd effects are included explicitly rather than just through an effective pressure term , when self gravity and spiral wave behavior are included , and perhaps again when the driving terms associated with correlated star formation are incorporated .",
    "but the essential effects are likely to persist .",
    "what goes up must come down .",
    "material nearer the plane returns sooner , hence producing the `` falling sky . ''",
    "velocities associated with small disturbances in the intercloud medium will produce spectral features , appearing to be clouds which in reality do not exist .",
    "spiral arm shocks will provoke vertical motions with periods that will lead to structure within the spiral waves themselves , and at periods that will tend to promote the formation of a hot halo overlying the cool disk .",
    "it is conceivable that the spiral waves might also , on occasion , produce such large upflows that the falling sky is an associated phenomenon .",

    "equation [ eqn26 ] can be simplified for use in searching for the normal modes of the disk by assuming that @xmath105 is a product of two functions : @xmath106 then equation [ eqn26 ] becomes : @xmath107 + \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{f^{\\prime } } f\\right ) ^2+\\left ( \\frac { f^{\\prime } } f\\right ) ^{\\prime } \\right ] \\epsilon + 2\\left ( \\frac{f^{\\prime } } f\\right ) \\epsilon ^{\\prime } + \\epsilon ^{\\prime \\prime } -\\frac{g^{\\prime } } { c_o^2}\\epsilon . \\label{eqn42}\\ ] ]    we can make the @xmath108 terms cancel if we define : @xmath109 so equation [ eqn42 ] becomes : @xmath110 further defining @xmath111 such that : @xmath112 and invoking @xmath113 in our search for normal modes , we have @xmath114 \\epsilon   . \\label{eqn48}\\ ] ] this is a second order differential equation with no first derivative term , similar to the time independent schrdinger equation .",
    "it can easily be solved numerically , and the eigenvalues @xmath115  searched for such that the boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "the outer boundary condition , however , is most easily described in terms of the original variable @xmath116 , to which we return next .",
    "( for an isothermal atmosphere with constant gravity , the quantity in brackets above is constant and the solutions sinusoids , providing a nice analytic test of numerical methods .",
    "similarly , an infinite isothermal atmosphere with linear gravity has polynomial solutions like the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator , the eigenvalues of which provide the mode frequencies in the limit of large - scale height , another useful test . )",
    "identification of the appropriate outer boundary condition is difficult , but we have designed the last parcel of the hydrocode to have only thermal pressure within it , and to have effectively zero pressure on its outer boundary .",
    "we therefore suspected that the appropriate boundary condition for the linear analysis might be that of a constant zero pressure .",
    "this would then require having zero change in the pressure , a pressure node , at the outer edge .",
    "the comoving pressure change is due to a change in density , such that @xmath122 , or with equation [ eqn15 ] : @xmath123 hence the outer boundary would be an antinode in @xmath105 , with no variation in pressure or density , and an extremum in the velocity . referring to figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig8 ] , it is easy to see why we were discouraged with this assumption .",
    "the pressures and densities do vary considerably in the outer parcels of the code .",
    "sometimes , but not frequently , the velocity has an extremum there . and",
    "yet , continuing with the assumption that @xmath105  should have an antinode at the boundary gave the same set of frequency eigenvalues found hydrodynamically , while no other assumption came close .",
    "the boundary condition at the midplane depends on whether the velocity is an even or odd function of @xmath0 . in terms of our other functions ,",
    "the velocity is : @xmath124 because @xmath125 is an even function of @xmath0 , even solutions in @xmath126  require : @xmath127 these are the `` sloshing '' modes , symmetric in @xmath126  and @xmath105  and antisymmetric in @xmath45 .      our procedure for solving for the normal modes involved , for a chosen value of @xmath129 , integrating equation [ eqn48 ] upward from @xmath130 where the boundary condition was taken to be either @xmath131  and @xmath132  for the sloshing modes , or @xmath133  and @xmath134for the breathing modes , with 1 being chosen as an arbitrary nonzero value .",
    "we also evaluated equation [ eqn55 ] for @xmath135 , and then scanned in @xmath129  until the outer boundary condition of equation [ eqn56 ] was satisfied with either zero or one node between the midplane and the outer boundary , finding in this way the fundamental and first overtones for that symmetry .",
    "as reported in the text , our results for the allowed periods were nearly identical to those found from the hydrodynamics .",

    "<S> this paper describes some interesting properties of waves in , and oscillations of , the interstellar medium in the direction normal to the plane of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to examine possible reasons for four observed phenomena : the falling sky in the northern hemisphere ; the apparent presence of clouds in absorption spectra when a sightline is occupied primarily only by warm intercloud gas ; the peculiar structuring of spiral arms involving clumps , spurs , and feathering ; and the existence of an abundance of high stage ions far off the plane of the galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> we explored the reaction of the interstellar medium - in the vertical direction only - to large imposed disturbances ( initial displacements , expansive velocities , and compressions ) , and to the introduction of small amplitude waves via oscillation of the midplane . </S>",
    "<S> our findings included : 1 ) the anticipated growth in amplitude of high frequency waves with height ; 2 ) the four lowest normal modes for the oscillation of the atmosphere as a whole , as functions of the height of the outer boundary ; 3 ) the time for material to ` bounce ' from one unusually dense state to the next as a function of height ; and 4 ) the tendency for the disk to develop a hot outer halo , either after the passage of a single shock from a large event , or in response to a continuous stream of small amplitude waves .    </S>",
    "<S> we discovered that three of the four observed phenomena targeted are likely to be closely connected . following a large expansion , </S>",
    "<S> material near the plane falls back first , with material at higher @xmath0 then falling in upon it . </S>",
    "<S> this provides precisely the sort of velocity segregation observed in the northern sky , at about 50 myr after the event . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this bounce time ( and/or the period of the subsequent smaller oscillations , which is about twice the bounce time ) may be linked to structure in the spiral arms , with vertical oscillations having been provoked by initial compressions in the arms . </S>",
    "<S> oscillations of the fundamental symmetric ( breathing ) mode of the ism also produce substantial disturbances in the outer atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> this can result in the production of an extensive layer of hot gas overlying the cooler disk material , i.e. a hot galactic halo with a significant population of high stage ions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , three of the four phenomena may be natural results of the simple existence of strong local compressions at the spiral arms , and the associated vertical motions in a thick galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the somewhat mysterious appearance of clouds in some absorption spectra can be produced by small amplitude waves in the ism . </S>",
    "<S> under the right conditions , clouds will seem to appear through `` velocity crowding , '' when in fact there are no density concentrations in space . </S>"
