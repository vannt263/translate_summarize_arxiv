    "classical information theory was laid down by shannon in the nineteen forties to characterize the ultimate rate at which one could hope to transmit classical information over a classical communication channel : the channel capacity .",
    "surprisingly in retrospective , not only it achieved its purpose but the capacity of classical channels turned out to comply with all the properties that one could expect for such a quantity : it can be efficiently computed  @xcite and it gauges the usefulness of the channel in the presence of any additional contextual channel .",
    "it is a natural consequence of additivity and convexity of the capacity in the set of channels .    with quantum channels complemented by various auxiliary resources ,",
    "a whole new range of communication tasks became feasible .",
    "notably , they allow for the transmission of quantum and private classical communication  tasks beyond the reach of classical channels . for most of these tasks ,",
    "the tools used to prove the capacity theorems in the classical case can be generalized .",
    "however , computability , additivity , and convexity  the three convenient properties of the classical capacity of classical channels  do not necessarily translate to the quantum case . in table  [ tableofcaps ] we summarize what is known about these properties for a set of relevant quantum channel capacities .    with the exception of the entanglement - assisted capacity @xcite , there is no known algorithm to compute any of these capacities .",
    "it is due to their characterization which in most cases is given by a regularized formula @xcite .",
    "moreover , even non - regularized quantities are notoriously hard to compute .",
    "for instance , the holevo information is known to be np - complete  @xcite .",
    "a capacity is non - additive as a function of a channel if for a given pair of channels the sum of their individual capacities is strictly smaller than the capacity of another channel which is constructed by using both channels in parallel .",
    "hence , a non - additive capacity is contextual : the usefulness of a channel for communication depends on what other channels are available .",
    "the private and quantum capacities are known to be non - additive  @xcite .",
    "this observation motivated authors in  @xcite to define a new quantity  the potential capacity  which characterizes the usefulness of a channel used in parallel with the best possible contextual channel .",
    ".main properties of quantum channel capacities : convexity , additivity , and computability .",
    "we consider quantum capacity @xmath0 , private capacity @xmath1 and unassisted , entanglement - assisted and environment - assisted classical capacities , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another important property of the capacities of quantum channels is convexity .",
    "the capacity @xmath5 of a quantum channel @xmath6 is non - convex if there exists a pair of channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that : @xmath10 in a same vein , non - convexity also implies that capacity is contextual . for a channel @xmath6 , a contextual channel @xmath11 and a mixing parameter @xmath9",
    "we can define a non - convexity functional : @xmath12\\ ] ] analogous to the one defined in @xcite for non - additivity .",
    "this functional induces a ( new ) potential capacity given by the maximization of @xmath13 over all contextual channels @xmath11 and @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath5 is non - convex , then there exists a channel @xmath6 such that its potential capacity is strictly larger than @xmath15 or , equivalently , there exists a triple @xmath16 for which @xmath17 .",
    "non - convexity is a surprising property in connection to two communication scenarios in which alice , the sender , has access to two channels that are used with probabilities @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the first one",
    ", alice uses both channels independently . in the second one ,",
    "alice encodes jointly over the two channels but has no control over which of the channels is applied ; instead , a black box applies them at random with the same probabilities @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the two scenarios are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : prot ] .",
    "in contrast to the classical capacity of classical channels , it was shown that the capacity of quantum channels for transmitting quantum information , i.e. the quantum capacity , is non - convex @xcite .",
    "the question that we address in the following is whether non - convexity is limited to the transmission of quantum information or can be observed beyond the task of entanglement transmission .",
    "we show that the private capacity and the classical environment - assisted capacities of a quantum channel are non - convex .",
    "the action of a quantum channel can always be defined by an isometry @xmath20 that takes the input system @xmath21 to the output @xmath22 together with an auxiliary system called the environment @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "this isometry allows to define the action of the complementary channel : @xmath25 .",
    "we denote the systems involved by a superscript , which we omit when they are clear from the context .",
    "let @xmath26 be a quantum state , we denote by @xmath27 the von neumann entropy .",
    "let @xmath28 be a bipartite quantum state , we denote by @xmath29 the mutual information between the systems @xmath30 and @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested in the following communication tasks and the associated channel capacities .",
    "the first task is the transmission of quantum information .",
    "the quantum capacity characterizes the ability of a quantum channel for this task in the absence of additional resources  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coherent information of a quantum channel .",
    "the maximum is taken over all input states purified with a reference system @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the von neumann entropies of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the identity channel .    for some channels , the coherent information is additive and thus exactly characterizes their capacity . in these cases ,",
    "it is possible to compute the capacity exactly  @xcite .",
    "however , there are examples when this is not the case  @xcite : coherent information is superadditive .",
    "not only the coherent information is superadditive , but also , the quantum capacity itself is superadditive  @xcite  there exist pairs of channels such that their joint capacity is strictly larger than the sum of their capacities .",
    "the second task is the transmission of private classical information .",
    "the capacity of a channel for this task without additional resources is called the private capacity  @xcite .",
    "we define the private information to be @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are evaluated on the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the private capacity is given by the regularization of the private information @xmath43 both private information  @xcite and the private capacity  @xcite were found to be superadditive .",
    "the third task is the transmission of classical information .",
    "the classical capacity  @xcite characterizes the capacity of a quantum channel for transmitting classical information without additional resources . to characterize the classical capacity",
    "we first define the holevo information @xmath44 the classical capacity is given by the regularization of the holevo information @xmath45 holevo information is superadditive  @xcite but it is a challenging open question whether or not the classical capacity verifies any of the three properties of convexity , additivity , and computability .",
    "in some scenarios , sender and receiver may share additional resources which they can leverage to increase their communication rates .",
    "the capacities of a channel for a communication task assisted by additional resources turn out to have completely different properties than their unassisted counterparts .",
    "one such example is shared entanglement .",
    "the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel @xmath46 is both convex and additive and can be computed efficiently  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may consider the environment of the channel as a friendly helper that ` assists ' the sender during information transmission @xcite .",
    "this third party can input states independently of the sender or even interact with the sender by exchanging messages .",
    "this gives rise to a host of environment - assisted classical capacities depending on whether we have active or passive environment assistance @xcite or whether the sender and environment are allowed to share entanglement or interact by means of local operations and classical communication . in our work ,",
    "we focus on the weakest variant of assistance for classical communication when the helper is in the product state with the sender @xcite .",
    "the corresponding capacity is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is an isometric extension of the channel such that : @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a state of the system @xmath23 over @xmath52 uses of the channel .",
    "we first show that private capacity is non - convex .",
    "let us first define two families of channels .",
    "the first is the @xmath53-dimensional erasure channel @xmath54 .",
    "its action is defined as follows : @xmath55 that is , @xmath54 takes the input to the output with probability @xmath19 and with probability @xmath18 it outputs an erasure flag . the private capacity of the erasure channel",
    "is known to be  @xcite : @xmath56    the second is the ` rocket channel ' @xmath57 .",
    "it was introduced by smith and smolin in  @xcite .",
    "it takes two @xmath53-dimensional inputs that we label @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the channel chooses two unitaries @xmath60 and @xmath20 at random   and @xmath20 are chosen uniformly at random from a unitary 2-design . choosing the clifford group or any other finite unitary 2 design has the advantage that the output of the channel is finite dimensional . ] and applies them to @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , followed by the application of a joint dephasing operation @xmath61 .",
    "the map is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 being a primitive @xmath53-th root of unity .",
    "finally , the first system is traced out and the second system together with a classical description of @xmath60 and @xmath20 is sent to the receiver .",
    "given @xmath60 and @xmath20 the action of the channel can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the total action of the channel is the average @xmath66    rocket channels have small classical capacity for @xmath67  @xcite : @xmath68 now let us consider a convex combination of a flagged erasure channel and a flagged rocket channel : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    in the following we prove that for some ranges of @xmath53 , @xmath18 and @xmath72 @xmath73 the right - hand side of is bounded from above by @xmath74 we can bound @xmath75 from below by @xmath76 .",
    "hence , we can argue that any achievable rate for quantum communication ( itself a lower bound on the quantum capacity ) is a lower bound on the private capacity .",
    "let @xmath77 be some input for two uses of channel @xmath78 .",
    "then : @xmath79 now , let the input be : @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents a maximally entangled state between systems @xmath30 and @xmath22 .",
    "we use a subscript if the register corresponds to a concrete channel use and a superscript to number the subsystem : @xmath82 stands for the first subsystem of the register @xmath58 in the second use of the channel and @xmath83 the second subsystem of an auxiliary register @xmath30 .",
    "the coherent information achieved by   is : @xmath84 see the supplemental material for details .",
    "consequently , the private capacity of @xmath78 is bounded from below by : @xmath85 it remains to compare the achievable bound in with the converse bound in . for any triple @xmath86 such that is strictly greater than the private capacity is non - convex .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonconvexity ] depicts the achievable region for which we exhibit non - convexity .",
    "when @xmath53 goes to infinity .",
    "a value larger than zero implies non - convexity of @xmath87 .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "we now turn to non - convexity of classical capacity with the weakest environment assistance .",
    "we start with providing two channels and a special entangled input state which we use to demonstrate this effect .",
    "consider a flagged combination of the two channels used in  @xcite to show superadditivity of @xmath4 .",
    "the first channel is defined by a controlled unitary @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath63 is again the primitive @xmath53-th root of unity .",
    "the second channel is a @xmath92 channel : @xmath93 .",
    "thus , our channels will have the form @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "fix @xmath96 . in the following",
    "we prove that for some range of @xmath18 : @xmath97 it follows from  @xcite that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "hence , the right - hand side of is bounded from above by @xmath100    in order to bound from below the left - hand side of , consider two uses of the channel @xmath101 .",
    "let the state of the environment be the maximally entangled state between @xmath102 and @xmath103 : @xmath104 and the input state to the channel : @xmath105 then , @xmath106 and since @xmath11 is flagged , we can also divide the mutual information into the sum of the mutual information associated with each channel action .",
    "let us compute the corresponding output states : @xmath107 note that @xmath108 is just @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 swapped .",
    "the state obtained from the action of @xmath112 follows from the observation that @xmath113 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath114 vanishes when @xmath115 is applied and takes the value @xmath116 when either @xmath117 or @xmath118 is applied . in the case of",
    "@xmath119 we can bound the mutual information by : @xmath120    let us justify .",
    "the input state is a clasical - quantum state of the form : @xmath121 .",
    "we can write explicitly the input states as : @xmath122 if we apply the channel to an input state , we can conclude from that the output does only depend on @xmath123 and it simplifies to : @xmath124 let @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we can check the orthogonality between two output states : @xmath127 is a geometric series . then ,",
    "if @xmath128 : @xmath129 that is , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are orthogonal except if @xmath132 and then @xmath133 .",
    "this is the case if @xmath53 divides @xmath134 which can only occur for @xmath135 .",
    "hence if @xmath53 is even there are @xmath136 orthogonal states and if @xmath53 is odd there are @xmath53 orthogonal states .",
    "we conclude that @xmath114 equals @xmath137 if @xmath53 is odd and @xmath138 if @xmath53 is even as claimed .    adding all the contributions we obtain for odd @xmath53 : @xmath139    finally",
    ", comparing the achievable bound in with the converse bound in one observes that for odd @xmath140 and @xmath141 the classical capacity with passive environment - assisted capacity is non - convex .",
    "computability , additivity , and convexity are three fundamental properties of capacity which allow to characterize the usefulness of a quantum channel for a concrete communication task .    here",
    ", we focused our attention on non - convexity .",
    "prior to our work , non - convexity had only been proven for the quantum capacity .",
    "we exhibit non - convexity of communication tasks involving classical information via quantum channels .",
    "hence , our results show that non - convexity is a generic feature of communications over quantum channels that is not merely restricted to the transmission of quantum information .",
    "furthermore , non - convexity is not an effect which concerns only a zero - measure set of quantum channels : by perturbing the channels in our construction one finds that the result still holds .",
    "however , it remains open how typical is non - convexity ( and non - additivity ) if one chooses two channels at random .",
    "both our non - convexity proofs and that of the quantum capacity build on top of non - additivity proofs .",
    "it is unclear if this is an artifact of the constructions or they hint to a deeper relation between both properties .",
    "moreover , the non - convexity functional that we introduce here gives rise to a potential capacity analogous to the one induced by non - additivity .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that the the two potential capacities , and more broadly , non - convexity and non - additivity , are closely related .",
    "hence , a better understanding of this relation might shed some light into how much do the different capacities really gauge the usefulness of quantum channels for communication tasks .",
