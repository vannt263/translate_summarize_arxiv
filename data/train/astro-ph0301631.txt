    "galaxies have a wide range of luminosities , colors , masses , sizes , surface brightnesses , morphologies , star formation histories and environments .",
    "this heterogeneity is not surprising , given the variety of physical processes which likely influence their formation and evolution , including gravitational collapse , hydrodynamics , turbulence , magnetic fields , black - hole formation and accretion , nuclear activity , tidal and merger interactions , and evolving and inhomogeneous cosmic radiation fields .",
    "what _ is _ surprising is that populations of galaxies show several very precise relationships among their measured properties .",
    "the properties we use to describe galaxies span a large `` configuration space '' , but galaxies do not fill it . galaxy spectral energy distributions , when scaled to a fixed broad - band luminosity , appear to occupy a thin , one - dimensional locus in color space or spectrum space ( e.g. , connolly & szalay 1999 ) .",
    "spiral galaxies show a good correlation between rotation velocity and luminosity ( e.g. , tully & fisher 1977 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "galaxy morphology is strongly correlated with broad - band colors , strengths of spectral features , and inferred star - formation histories ( e.g. , roberts & haynes 1994 ) .    among all galaxy families , early - type (",
    "elliptical and s0 ) galaxies show the most precise regularities ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; burstein , bender , faber & nolthenius 1997 ) .",
    "early - type galaxy surface - brightness distributions follow a very simple , universal `` de  vaucouleurs '' profile ( de  vaucouleurs 1948 ) .",
    "their spectral energy distributions appear to be virtually universal , showing very little variation with mass , environment , or cosmic time ( e.g. , van  dokkum & franx 1996 ; pahre 1998 ) .",
    "what variations they do show are measurable and precise .",
    "early - type galaxy colors , luminosities , half - light radii , velocity dispersions , and surface brightnesses are all correlated ( baum 1959 ; fish 1964 ; faber & jackson 1976 ; kormendy 1977 ; bingelli , sandage & tarenghi 1984 ) ; they can be combined into a two - dimensional `` fundamental plane '' with very little scatter ( e.g. , dressler et al .",

    "1987 ) .",
    "the homogeneity of the early - type galaxy population is difficult to understand if early - type galaxies are assembled at late times by stochastic mergers of less - massive galaxies of , presumably , different ages , star formation histories , and gas contents , as many models postulate ( e.g. , larson 1975 ; white & rees 1978 ; van albada 1982 ; kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",

    "the observable properties of the stellar content of early - type galaxies are fixed entirely by the properties of the collisionless , self - gravitating , dark - matter haloes in which we believe such galaxies lie ( e.g. , hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "these halos , almost by definition , are not subject to the vagaries of gas dynamics , star formation , and magnetic fields ; they are influenced only by gravity .",
    "it is essentially a stated goal of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",

    "the errors in @xmath29 band measurements are larger than the others , so we will only present results in the other four bands .",
    "in addition , the photometric solutions we use in this paper are preliminary ( for details , see discussion of the early data release in stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) ; we use @xmath34 rather than @xmath31 , and similarly for the other bands , to denote this .",
    "the effective integration time is 54  sec .",
    "the raw ccd images are bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and background - subtracted .",
    "pixels contaminated by the light of cosmic rays and bad columns are masked .",
    "astronomical sources are detected and overlapping sources are de - blended .",
    "the data are flux - calibrated by comparison with a set of overlapping standard - star fields calibrated with a 0.5-m `` photometric telescope '' ( hogg et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al .",
    "the photometric telescope is also used for measuring the atmospheric extinction coefficients in the five bands .",
    "the median effective seeing ( the median fwhm of the stellar profiles ) for the observations used here is @xmath35 .",
    "all of this image processing is performed with software specially designed for reducing sdss data ( lupton et al .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath34-band zero - point calibration is @xmath36  mag ; the uncertainty in the sky background subtraction is less than about 1% .",
    "surface photometry measurements are obtained by fitting a set of two - dimensional models to the images .",
    "the model fits account for the effects of seeing , atmospheric extinction , and galactic extinction ( this last uses the results of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) . the sdss model for seeing",
    "is described in stoughton et al .",
    "briefly , the psf is expected to have a fourier transform @xmath37 $ ] characteristic of kolmogorov turbulence ( e.g. , saglia et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this psf is approximated as the sum of gaussians ( this parametrization allows for a substantial reduction in the processing time required to deconvolve the effects of seeing ) .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline fits two models to the two - dimensional image of each object in each band : a pure de  vaucouleurs profile and a pure exponential profile ( e.g. stoughton et al . 2002 ) .",
    "briefly , the photon counts are binned into a number of radial and twelve angular bins .",
    "then , two - dimensional de  vaucouleurs and exponential models , convolved with the seeing , are fitted to the cumulative binned counts .",
    "the pipeline does not include more complicated models ( e.g. , bulge plus disk ) because the computational expense to compute them is not justified for the majority of the detected objects .",
    "algorithms which fit bulge and disk components ( which are desirable to fit on large galaxies ) to the surface brightness profiles are currently being developed within the collaboration , but are not yet available .",
    "we present examples of @xmath34-band images and mean surface brightness profiles in section  [ checkphoto ] .",
    "the sdss image processing software provides several global photometric parameters , for each object , which are obtained independently in each of the five bands . because we are interested in early - type galaxies , we use",
    "primarily the following :    * the ratio @xmath38 of the lengths of the minor and major axes of the observed surface brightness profile . * the effective radius ( or half - light radius ) @xmath39 along the major axis and * the total magnitude @xmath40 ; these are computed by fitting a two - dimensional version of de  vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath41 model to the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "( the fitting procedure accounts for the effects of seeing  we test the accuracy of this procedure below . )",
    "* likelihood parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 that indicate how well the de vaucouleurs or exponential models , when convolved with a model for the seeing , fit the observed light profile .",
    "* the _ model _ magnitude @xmath44 ; this is the total magnitude calculated by using the ( de vaucouleurs or exponential ) model which fits the galaxy profile best in the @xmath34-band .",
    "the _ model _",
    "magnitudes in the other four bands are computed using that @xmath34 fit as filter ; in effect , this measures the colors of a galaxy through the same aperture . * the petrosian magnitude @xmath45 is also computed ; this is the flux within @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is defined as the angular radius at which the ratio of the local surface brightness at @xmath31 to the mean surface brightness within a radius @xmath31 is 0.2 ( petrosian 1976 ) . * the petrosian radii @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; these are the angular radii containing 50% and 90% of the petrosian light , respectively .",
    "although our analyses on early - type galaxy properties presented here and in the companion papers have been performed with both the de  vaucouleurs fit parameters and the petrosian quantities , in most of our analyses only the results of the de  vaucouleurs fits are presented .",
    "this is because the de  vaucouleurs model appears to be a very good fit to the early - type galaxy surface - brightness profiles in the sdss sample and because it is conventional , in the literature on early - type galaxies , to use these quantities . on the other hand , for reasons given in stoughton et al .",

    "the sdss takes spectra only for a target subsample of objects .",
    "target selection criteria are described in stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and strauss et al .",
    "spectra are obtained using a multi - object spectrograph which observes 640 objects at once .",
    "each spectroscopic plug plate , 1.5 degrees in radius , has 640 fibers , each @xmath50 in diameter .",
    "two fibers can not be closer than @xmath51 due to the physical size of the fiber plug .",
    "typically @xmath52 fibers per plate are used for galaxies , @xmath53 for qsos , and the remaining for sky spectra and spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "each plate typically has three to five spectroscopic exposures of fifteen minutes , depending on the observing conditions ( weather , moon ) ; a minimum of three exposures is taken to ensure adequate cosmic ray rejection . for galaxies at @xmath54",
    "the median spectrum @xmath55 per pixel is 16 ( see figure  [ fig : vmeth ] in appendix  [ vmethods ] ) .",
    "the wavelength range of each spectrum is @xmath56   .",
    "the instrumental dispersion is @xmath57dex / pixel which corresponds to 69  km  s@xmath23 per pixel .",
    "( there is actually some variation in this instrumental dispersion with wavelength , which we account for ; see figure  [ fig : resol ] and associated discussion in appendix  [ vmethods ] . )",
    "the instrumental resolution of galaxy spectra , measured from the autocorrelation of stellar template spectra , ranges from 85 to 105 km  s@xmath23 , with a median value of 92 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "a highly automated software package has been designed for reducing sdss spectral data .",
    "the raw data are bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , wavelength calibrated , sky - lines removed , co - added , cleaned from residual glitches ( cosmic rays , bad pixels ) , and flux calibrated . the spectro - software classifies objects by spectral type and determines emission and absorption redshifts .",
    "( redshifts are corrected to the heliocentric reference frame . ) the redshift success rate for objects targeted as galaxies is @xmath58% and errors in the measured redshift are less than about @xmath59 . once the redshift as been determined the following quantites are computed : absorption - line strengths ( brodie & hance 1986 ; diaz , terlevich & terlevich 1989 ; trager et al .",
    "1998 ) , equivalent widths of the emission lines , and eigen - coefficients and classification numbers of a pca analysis ( connolly & szalay 1999 ) .",
    "some information about the reliability of the redshift and the quality of the spectrum is also provided .",
    "we present examples of the spectra in section  [ exspec ] .",
    "the sdss pipeline does not provide an estimate of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , within a galaxy , so we compute it separately for the early - type galaxy sample ( see section  [ vdisp ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this series of papers is to study the properties of early - type galaxies using the main galaxy sample of the sdss database . therefore , one of the crucial steps in our study is the separation of galaxies into early and late types .",
    "we want to select objects whose spectra are good enough to compute the central velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , because we wish to study the colors of the galaxies in our sample , we must not use color information to select the sample . to reach our goal ,",
    "we have selected galaxies which satisfy the following criteria :    * concentration index @xmath60 in @xmath61 ; * the likelihood of the de vaucouleurs model is at least 1.03 times the likelihood of the exponential model ; * spectra with pca classification numbers @xmath62 , typical of early - type galaxy spectra ( connolly & szalay 1999 ) ; * spectra without masked regions ( the sdss spectroscopic pipeline outputs a warning flag for spectra of low quality ; we only chose spectra for which this flag was set to zero ) ; * @xmath63 ; * redshift @xmath64 .",
    "section  [ vdisp ] describes how we estimate the velocity dispersion @xmath9 for galaxies which satisfy the above criteria .",
    "we consider velocity dispersion estimates smaller than about 70  km  s@xmath23 to be unreliable ( see appendix  [ vmethods ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the final sample presented in section  [ catalog ] , galaxies with @xmath65  km  s@xmath23 have been excluded .",
    "the results of this and the companion papers are not significantly different if we change the cut - off on velocity dispersions to 100  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "about 9,000 objects satisfied all the above criteria .    as stated earlier , the sdss pipeline does not output disk - to - bulge ratios from fits to the light profiles .",
    "the first two requirements above attempt to select profile shapes which are likely to be those of spheroidal systems .",
    "the @xmath61 band measurements tend to be less noisy than @xmath66 or @xmath67 , so we chose to use the @xmath61 band estimate of how centrally concentrated the light is .",
    "the second requirement reduces approximately to requiring that @xmath68 ; that is , the surface brightness profile should be better fit by the de  vaucouleurs model than by an exponential .",
    "the spectra of late - type galaxies show emission lines , so examining the spectra ( e.g. , using the pca classification ) is a simple way of removing such objects from the sample . because the aperture of an sdss spectroscopic fiber ( @xmath50 ) samples only the inner parts of nearby galaxies , and because the spectrum of the bulge of a nearby late - type galaxy can resemble that of an early - type galaxy , it is possible that some nearby late - type galaxies could be mistakenly included in the sample ( e.g. , kochanek , pahre & falco 2000 ) .",
    "most of these will have been excluded by the first two cuts on the shape of the light profile . to check this , we visually inspected all galaxies with @xmath69 . about @xmath70 of 225 ( i.e. , about 20% ) looked like late - types , and so we removed them .",
    "note that weak emission lines , such as h@xmath71 and/or o  ii , are still present in the early - type galaxy spectra in our sample .",
    "for example , the median h@xmath71 equivalent width for galaxies in our sample is @xmath72   , but @xmath73% of the galaxies have equivalent widths larger than @xmath74    and @xmath75% of these ( i.e. 0.5% of the sample ) have equivalent widths in the range @xmath76   .",
    "similarly , although the median equivalent width of o  ii is @xmath77   , @xmath78 of the galaxies show o  ii equivalent widths larger than @xmath79    and @xmath80 of these ( i.e. , 1.5% of the sample ) have equivalent widths ranging from @xmath81 to @xmath82   .    the reason for our redshift cut is as follows .",
    "the sdss main galaxy sample from which we select our early - type galaxies is apparent magnitude limited in @xmath34 , where the limits are defined using petrosian magnitudes @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the main galaxy sample is not magnitude limited in the other bands .",
    "blanton et al . ( 2001 ) describe the cuts in @xmath45 one must apply in the other bands to obtain complete magnitude limited samples .",
    "they also note that @xmath83 .",
    "since we will almost always be working with @xmath40 rather than @xmath45 , our cuts are slightly different from theirs ; the cuts we use to define magnitude limited samples in the different bands are summarized in table  [ tab : photerr ] ( also see figure  [ fig : appmz ] ) .    at @xmath84 , however , most early - type galaxies in the sdss database were targeted using different selection criteria than were used for the main sdss galaxy sample ( see strauss et al . 2002 ; they make - up the luminous red galaxy sample described by eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the interest of keeping our sample as close to being magnitude limited as possible , we restricted our sample to @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , one might expect an increasing fraction of the early - type population at higher redshifts to have emission lines : if so , then our removal of emission line objects amounts to a small but redshift dependent selection effect .",
    "since our sample is restricted to @xmath85 , this bias should be small .",
    "=    before moving on , it is worth pointing out that there is a morphologically based selection cut which we could have made but did nt .",
    "elliptical galaxies are expected to have axis ratios greater than about @xmath86 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "since we have axis ratio measurements of all the objects in our sample , we could have included a cut on @xmath38 .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure  [ abscatter ] shows the distribution axis ratios @xmath38 in our @xmath34 sample : about 20% of the objects in it have @xmath87 .",
    "( the spike at @xmath88 is artificial ",
    "the pipeline reports large uncertainties in the fitted value of @xmath38 for these objects . )",
    "our combination of cuts on the shapes of the light profiles and spectral features mean that these objects are unlikely to be late - type galaxies .",
    "indeed , a visual inspection of a random sample of the objects with axis ratios smaller than 0.6 shows that they look like s0s .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure  [ abscatter ] shows that @xmath38 does not correlate with color : in particular , the colors of the most flattened objects are not bluer than in the rest of the sample .",
    "also , recall that all objects with @xmath89 arcsec were visually inspected and these , despite having @xmath87 ( top left panel ) , did not appear peculiar .",
    "in addition , @xmath38 does not correlate with surface brightness or apparent magnitude .",
    "galaxies with small angular sizes @xmath39 are assigned large values of @xmath38 only slightly more often than average ( top left panel ; the median @xmath38 is 0.79 , 0.78 , 0.76 , and 0.7 for @xmath39 in the range 12 , 23 , 34 and greater than 4 arcsec ) .",
    "however , there is a weak trend for the objects at higher @xmath33 to be rounder ( middle right panel ) .",
    "this trend with @xmath33 may be related to the magnitude limit of our sample rather than reflecting problems associated with the fits to the observed light profiles .",
    "( the two bands at @xmath90 and @xmath91 show that the effects of large scale clustering in our sample are significant . )",
    "section  [ landr ] describes how we convert from the observed half - light radius @xmath39 to an estimate of the physical half - light radius @xmath21 , and section  [ vdisp ] discusses how we estimate velocity dispersions .",
    "objects with smaller values of @xmath21 tend to be more flattened ( top right panel ) , and to have slightly smaller velocity dispersions ( middle left ) ; because of the magnitude limit , these objects drop out of our sample at higher redshifts . requiring",
    "that @xmath92 would remove such objects from our sample completely .    in paper",
    "iii we study the fundamental plane populated by the galaxies in this sample .",
    "excluding all objects with @xmath93 has no effect on the shape of this plane .",
    "so , in the interests of keeping our sample as close to being magnitude limited as possible , we chose not to make an additional selection cut on @xmath38 .",
    "=    =    figure  [ fig : appmz ] shows the distribution of the @xmath94 apparent magnitudes in our sample as a function of redshift .",
    "the dashed lines in each panel show the magnitude limits summarized in table  [ tab : photerr ] ; the magnitude limited samples span the redshift range @xmath95 .",
    "to convert the apparent magnitude @xmath96 to an absolute magnitude @xmath97 we must assume a particular cosmology and account for the fact that at different redshifts an observed bandpass corresponds to different restframe bands ( the k - correction ) .",
    "we write the hubble constant today as @xmath98 km  s@xmath23mpc@xmath23 and use @xmath99 .",
    "most of our sample is at @xmath100 km  s@xmath23 ; since line - of - sight peculiar velocities are not expected to exceed more than a few thousand km  s@xmath23 , we feel that it is reasonable to assume that all of a galaxy s redshift is due to the hubble recession velocity .",
    "this means that we can compute the absolute magnitude in a given band by @xmath101 - 25 - k(z)$ ] , where @xmath96 is the apparent magnitude , @xmath102 is the luminosity distance in mpc ( from , e.g. , weinberg 1972 ; hogg 1999 ) , and @xmath103 is the k - correction for the band .    because we have five colors and a spectrum for each galaxy , we could , in principle , compute an empirical k - correction for each galaxy .",
    "this requires a good understanding of the accuracy of the sdss photometry and spectroscopy , and should be possible when the survey is closer to completion . rather than follow the procedure adopted by the 2dfgrs ( madgwick et al . 2002 ) , or a procedure based on finding the closest template spectrum to each galaxy and using it to compute the k - correction ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1999 for the cnoc2 survey ) , we use a single redshift dependent template spectrum to estimate the k - correction . in effect , although this allows galaxies at different redshift to be different , it ignores the fact that not all galaxies at the same redshift are alike . as a result ,",
    "the absolute luminosities we compute are not as accurate as they could be , and this can introduce scatter in the various correlations we study below . of course , using a realistic k - correction is important , because inaccuracies in @xmath103 can masquerade as evolutionary trends .    for the reasons discussed more fully in appendix  [ kcorrs ] ,",
    "our k - corrections are based on a combination of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) prescriptions .",
    "specifically , the k - corrections we apply were obtained by taking a bruzual & charlot model for a @xmath104 object which formed its stars with an imf given by kroupa ( 2001 ) in a single solar metallicity and abundance ratio burst 9  gyr ago , computing the difference between the k - correction when evolution is allowed and ignored , and adding this difference to the k - corrections associated with coleman , wu & weedman early type galaxy template .",
    "the results which follow are qualitatively similar for a number of other k - correction schemes ( see appendix  [ kcorrs ] for details ) .",
    "in addition to correcting the observed apparent magnitudes to absolute magnitudes , we must also apply two corrections to convert the ( seeing corrected ) effective angular radii , @xmath39 , output by the sdss pipeline to physical radii .",
    "first , we define the equivalent circular effective radius @xmath105 .",
    "( although the convention is to use @xmath106 to denote the effective radius , we feel that the notation @xmath107 is better , since it emphasizes that the radius is an effective circular , rather than elliptical aperture . )",
    "the reason we must make a second correction is shown in figure  [ angre ] .",
    "the different panels show the distribution of ( seeing corrected ) effective angular sizes @xmath39 of the galaxies in the different bands .",
    "notice that @xmath39 for most of the objects is larger than the typical seeing scale of 1.5 arcsec : we discuss this further in section  [ checkphoto ] .",
    "comparison of the mean sizes in the different panels ( the text in the top right corner of each panel ) shows that galaxies appear slightly larger in the bluer bands .",
    "because our sample covers a reasonably large range in redshift , this trend means we must correct the effective sizes to a fixed restframe wavelength . therefore , when converting from effective angular size @xmath107 to effective physical size @xmath21 we correct @xmath107 ( and the petrosian radii @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) in each band by linearly interpolating from the observed bandpasses to the central rest wavelength of each filter .",
    "the typical correction is of the order of 4% , although it is sometimes as large as 10% . in this respect , this correction is analogous to the k - correction we would ideally have applied to the magnitude and surface brightness of each galaxy .",
    "note that the dependence of size on wavelength is also important for analyses of color gradients and the color ",
    "magnitude relation presented in paper  iv .",
    "our study will also require the effective surface brightness @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the mean surface brightness within the effective radius @xmath21 ( as opposed to the surface brightness at @xmath21 ) .",
    "in particular , we set @xmath110 .",
    "note that this quantity is k - corrected , and also corrected for the cosmological @xmath111 dimming .",
    "our earlier remarks about the k - correction are also relevant here .",
    "=    there is some discussion in the literature about the effects of seeing on estimates of the effective radius , and hence the effective surface brightness .",
    "these effects are unimportant if the seeing scale , @xmath112 ( the fwhm in arcsec ) , is an order of magnitude smaller than the effective radius ( e.g. , saglia et al .",
    "1993 , 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : seeinghist ] shows histograms of @xmath113 in the @xmath66 , @xmath34 , @xmath61 and @xmath67 bands : the effective radius is typically only a factor of two larger than the seeing .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of our estimates of the effective radii depend crucially on the correction for seeing being accurate .",
    "=    to illustrate that the de  vaucouleurs model fits output by the sdss photometric pipeline are reasonable , figure  [ fig : seeing ] shows the ratio of @xmath114 $ ] times the half - light radius to @xmath112 in the @xmath66 and @xmath34 bands ( top and bottom panels ) as a function of redshift , in a few volume limited catalogs .",
    "the catalog limits were chosen to be 0.5  mags wide , so the galaxies in any given catalog should all be quite similar to each other .",
    "( the factor @xmath115 removes the expected scaling of angular diameter with redshift . ) it is important to use volume limited samples to make the measurement , because size is known to correlate with luminosity ( more luminous galaxies are larger on average ) , and in a magnitude limited sample such as ours , only the more luminous objects are present at higher redshifts .    in the panels on the left",
    ", the half - light radius is estimated by @xmath39 , which has been corrected for seeing , whereas the panels on the right use @xmath48 , which is not seeing - corrected .",
    "seeing tends to increase the half - light radius , and indeed , in the panel on the right , there is a clear trend for the half - light radii to increase with redshift .",
    "this trend is absent in the panels on the left , suggesting that the fitting procedure accounts quite well for the effects of seeing .",
    "the panels on the left even show a slight decrease with redshift  we argue later ( see discussion of figure  [ fig : xzr ] in section  [ catalog ] ) that this may be a consequence of luminosity evolution .",
    "=    we have argued that our estimates of @xmath39 are probably not strongly compromised by seeing . in our dataset , @xmath39 is about a factor of two smaller than the radius @xmath116 at which the fitted surface brightness is 10% of the sky level .",
    "therefore , errors in the sky subtraction may also compromise our estimates of @xmath39 .",
    "if the same object is moved to higher redshift but the sky level is kept fixed , then one expects @xmath117 because cosmological surface brightness dimming scales as @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , a plot of @xmath118 versus @xmath119 , measured from volume limited catalog , should have a slope of @xmath120 .",
    "however , because each volume limited catalog spans a large range in redshift , we must also account for the surface brightness dimming associated with the fact that redshift dependent @xmath121-corrections must be made to estimate fixed restframe luminosities .",
    "therefore , we expect the scaling with redshift to be slightly stronger : @xmath122",
    ".    figure  [ fig : re10sky ] shows how @xmath123 depends on @xmath119 , in the same volume limited catalogs as before ; solid lines show the mean trend in the faintest ( top ) to the most luminous ( bottom ) catalogs .",
    "comparison with the dashed line , which has a slope of @xmath124 , shows that the scaling with redshift is close to that expected .",
    "( note that it is important to use volume limited catalogs to make the measurement : the trend in any given volume limited subsample is shallower than the trend one would infer by first combining together all the subsamples and then making the measurement . to see why this happens ,",
    "suppose that the mean size at fixed luminosity scales as @xmath125 .",
    "then the magnitude limit induces a correlation which should scale approximately as @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath127 then @xmath39 increases with @xmath33 , so @xmath128 decreases with @xmath33 simply because of the magnitude limit . )",
    "some of the small differences in slope between the dashed and solid lines can be attributed to the effects of luminosity evolution . by fixing @xmath129 , we select objects which are slightly smaller at higher @xmath33 ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : xzr ] ) , hence have slightly smaller values of @xmath39 and so larger values of @xmath128 than expected ; so they appear to decline less rapidly than const@xmath130 .",
    "luminosity evolution is expected to be stronger in the bluer bands , and the @xmath66 band relation does appear to be slightly shallower than the other bands .",
    "thus , as was the case for @xmath113 , we see redshift dependent trends in @xmath128 which we believe are physically reasonable .",
    "the sky - subtraction procedure does not appear to have introduced any obvious artifacts into our estimates of @xmath39 .",
    "finally , we turn to an inspection of how well the de  vaucouleurs model actually fits the observed surface brightness profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : devfits ] shows angular averaged surface brightness profiles in the @xmath66 , @xmath34 , @xmath61 and @xmath67 bands ( bottom to top in each of the upper panels ) , for a random selection of galaxies in our sample , ordered by redshift and size .",
    "the text in each panel shows the plate number , mjd , and fiber i d number of the observation , the redshift @xmath33 , the fitted apparent @xmath34 magnitude @xmath131 , the fitted axis ratio @xmath38 , and the effective physical radius @xmath21 , computed from the fitted angular radius @xmath39 , the fitted axis ratio and the redshift , as described previously .",
    "the solid lines show de  vaucouleurs profiles which , when convolved with the pipeline s model for the seeing , provide the best fit to the symbols ( because the fits are actually not to these azimuthally averaged one - dimensional profiles , but to the two dimensional profile , they serve mainly as guides to the eye . )",
    "the horizontal lines show the surface brightness at 1% of the sky in the different bands .",
    "long , medium and short tick marks on these lines show @xmath112 , @xmath39 and @xmath132 , the radius at which the fitted surface brightness equals 10% of the sky .",
    "the bottom panels show the residuals ( observed minus fit ) in the different bands ( crosses , stars , diamonds and triangles show the @xmath66 , @xmath34 , @xmath61 and @xmath67 band results , respectively ) .",
    "the residuals are systematically low on small scales , but comparison with the large tick marks , which indicate the size of the seeing disk , show that this discrepancy is because we are comparing fits which have been corrected for seeing with the observed surface brightnesses which are not seeing - corrected . on larger scales ( typically larger than twice the half - light radii ) , the residuals are also large , indicating that there may be problems with the sky subtraction . in linear flux units ,",
    "the residuals tend to a constant value which is typically smaller than 0.3% of the sky level ( recall that the horizontal lines in the panels show the surface brightness at 1% of sky ) .",
    "although this is not an entirely fair comparison , since the fits are not to performed on these azimuthally averaged one - dimensional profiles , but to the two dimensional profile , this test suggests that the fit is reliable , but that the zero - point level of the sky may be systematically biased by @xmath133% . note that the residuals are larger in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 bands ; but this is consistent with the larger errors we quote on the photometry in these bands .",

    "the images are each @xmath134  arcsec@xmath135 ( i.e. , 30 pixels on a side ) .",

    "( the errors in @xmath170 and @xmath172 listed in this table were derived from the estimates @xmath173 of the previous table . as discussed in appendix  [ errors ] , they are also the appropriate estimates for the error on @xmath40 and @xmath174 . )",
    "=    some properties of our @xmath34 sample as a function of redshift @xmath33 are shown in figure  [ fig : xzr ] .",
    "the panels show the k - corrected absolute magnitude @xmath97 , the k - corrected effective surface brightness @xmath169 , also corrected for cosmological surface brightness dimming , the effective circular radius @xmath21 in @xmath175  kpc , corrected to a standard restframe wavelength , the aperture corrected velocity dispersion @xmath9 in km  s@xmath23 , and two quantities which are related to an effective mass and density , all plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "the bold lines in the top left panel show the effect of the apparent magnitude cuts .",
    "there is , in addition , a cut at small velocity dispersion ( @xmath176  km  s@xmath23 ) which , for our purposes here , is mostly irrelevant .",
    "the apparent magnitude cuts imply complex @xmath33-dependent cuts on the other parameters we observe . in the papers which follow ,",
    "we attempt to account correctly for the selection effects that the magnitude cuts imply .    for small intervals in luminosity , our sample is complete over a reasonably large range in redshifts .",
    "to illustrate , the thin boxes in the top - left panel show bins in absolute magnitude of width 0.5 mags over which the sample is complete .",
    "the solid lines in the other panels show how the median surface - brightnesses , sizes , velocity dispersions , masses and densities of galaxies in each @xmath34 luminosity bin change as a function of redshift .",
    "although all these quantities depend on luminosity , the figure shows that , at fixed luminosity , there is some evidence for evolution : at fixed luminosity the average surface brightness is brightening .",
    "the size at fixed luminosity decreases at a rate which is about five times smaller than the rate of change of @xmath169 .",
    "this suggests that it is the luminosities which are changing and not the sizes .",
    "( to see why , suppose that the average size at fixed absolute magnitude is @xmath177\\rangle = s[m - m_*(z)]$ ] , where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are characteristic values , and @xmath180 is the slope of this mean relation .",
    "if the characteristic luminosity increases with @xmath33 , but the characteristic size remains constant , @xmath181 , and the slope of the relation also does not change , then the mean size at fixed @xmath97 decreases with @xmath33 .",
    "the surface brightness is @xmath182 , so the mean @xmath169 at fixed @xmath97 changes five times faster than the mean @xmath21 , at fixed luminosity .",
    "this argument is also relevant to figures  [ fig : seeing ] and  [ fig : re10sky ] , since those plots use @xmath39 which differs from @xmath21 by two small correction factors [ c.f .",
    "section  [ landr ] ] . ) in paper  ii we argue that this trend is qualitatively consistent with that expected of a passively evolving population .",
    "this is the first of four papers which study the properties of early - type galaxies at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this paper describes how we selected the sample from the sdss database using objective criteria and present the measured photometric and spectroscopic parameters for @xmath8 early - type galaxies ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the database contains the redshift of these galaxies as well as reliable measurements of a number of photometric properties ( luminosities , sizes , surface brightnesses , colors ) in the @xmath66 , @xmath34 , @xmath61 and @xmath67 bands .",
    "( data in the @xmath183 band is also available , but , because it is noisier , we did not use it here . )    the galaxies in our sample span the redshift range @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , differences between observed and restframe wavelengths are not negligible . we discussed a number of methods for estimating the appropriate k - correction which must be applied to obtain luminosities which sample the same restframe wavelength range ( appendix  [ kcorrs ] ) .",
    "since the half - light radii also depend on wavelength ( figure  [ angre ] ) , we also corrected these to sizes at fixed restframe wavelengths .",
    "finally , we estimated the internal velocity dispersions of these galaxies ( appendix  [ vmethods ] ) , which , following common practice , we corrected to an aperture of @xmath184 ( c.f .",
    "equation  [ appcorr ] ) .",
    "the resulting catalog listing the restframe photometric and spectroscopic parameters of @xmath8 early - type galaxies ( table  [ tab : phys ] ) is useful for measuring correlations between these various observables , such as the faber - jackson @xmath185 relation , the kormendy @xmath186 relation , the @xmath187 relation , the fundamental plane @xmath188 relation , and the color  magnitude relation .",
    "the sample is essentially magnitude limited ( table  [ tab : photerr ] , figure  [ fig : appmz ] ) , and the galaxies in it populate a range of environments ( figure  [ fig : pie ] ) . therefore , the sample can be used for studying how the correlations discussed above depend on environment and redshift .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig : xzr ] shows evidence for weak evolution in the luminosities , and figure  [ lrvden ] shows evidence for some weak environmental dependences .",
    "these will be quantified in papers  ii and  iii .",
    "neither the k - corrections nor the aperture corrections we apply to the velocity dispersions are ideal . by the time the sloan digital sky survey is complete , the uncertainties in the k - corrections , which prevent us at the present time from making precise quantitative statements about the evolution of the luminosities and colors ,",
    "will be better understood .",
    "in addition , the size of the sample will have increased by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this larger sample will allow us to use the data directly to estimate the correct aperture correction which should be applied to the velocity dispersions .",
    "this is discussed more fully in appendix  [ vr ] .",

    "when converting the observed apparent magnitude to the rest - frame absolute magnitude of an object , we must account for the fact that the sdss filters measure the light from a fixed spectral range in the observers rest - frame ; therefore , they measure different parts of the rest - frame spectrum of galaxies at different redshifts . correcting for this",
    "is known as the k - correction .",
    "one way to make this correction is to assume that all the galaxies at a given redshift are similar , and to use an empirically determined template spectrum , measured from a few accurately measured spectra , to estimate the k - correction .",
    "using a mean color to estimate the k - correction is not ideal . when the survey is closer to completion it should become possible to make this correction on an object - by - object basis .",
    "empirically determined template spectra for early - type galaxies at low redshifts exist ( e.g. coleman , wu & weedeman 1980 ; fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "( we used n. benitez s bayesian photometric redshift package ( benitez 2000 ) to derive k - corrections for the coleman , wu & weedman early - type galaxy template in the sdss passbands . ) if we were certain that evolution effects were not important , then these empirically determined k - corrections would allow us to work out the k - corrections we should apply to the high redshift population .",
    "however , if the stars in early - type galaxies formed at approximately the same time , and if the mass in the galaxies has remained constant , so the evolution is entirely due to the passive aging of the stellar population , then , the mass to light ratio of early - type galaxies is expected to vary approximately as @xmath189 ( e.g. , tinsley & gunn 1976 ) , with the precise scaling being different in different bands .",
    "because our sample spans a relatively large range in redshift , we may be sensitive to the effects of this passive evolution .",
    "in addition , because the sample is large , we may be able to measure , and hence be sensitive to , even a relatively small amount of evolution .",
    "for this reason , it would be nice to have a prescription for making k - corrections which accounts for evolution .",
    "absent empirically determined templates for this evolution , we must use stellar population systhesis models to estimate this evolution , and so determine k - corrections for different bands .",
    "=    as a first example , we chose a bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model for a @xmath104 object which formed its stars with the universal imf given by kroupa ( 2001 ) in a single solar metallicity and abundance ratio burst 9  gyr ago .",
    "we then recorded how its colors , as observed through the sdss filters , changed as it was moved through redshift without altering its age .",
    "this provides what we will call the no - evolution k - correction .",
    "figure  [ kcww - kbc ] shows a comparison of this with the empirical coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) nonevolving k - corrections .",
    "the two estimates are in good agreement in @xmath66 and @xmath61 out to @xmath190 .",
    "they differ substantially at higher redshifts , but this is not a concern because none of the galaxies in our sample are so distant . in @xmath34 and @xmath67 the two estimates agree only at @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , quantitative estimates of evolution in luminosity and/or color will depend on which k - correction we use .",
    "=    figure  [ fig : kcorr ] compares both sets of nonevolving templates with the observed colors of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the upper set of curves in each panel show the colors associated with the nonevolving coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) template ( dotted ) and the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) no - evolution model ( dashed ) .",
    "the figure shows that both predictions for @xmath192 are similar , but that they are different for @xmath193 and @xmath194 , with the differences increasing with redshift .",
    "[ in both cases , we have shifted the predicted @xmath192 blueward by 0.08  mag at all @xmath33 .",

    "=    we argue in papers  ii , iii and  iv that the luminosities , colors and chemical abundance ratios of these objects show evidence for passive evolution : the higher redshift population appears to be slightly younger .",
    "therefore , our next step is to include the effects of evolution . because the predicted observed colors at redshift zero are in good agreement with our data , we took the same bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model , but this time we recorded how its rest - frame colors evolve with redshift , and then computed what these evolved ( i.e. , @xmath33-dependent ) colors look like when observed in the sdss filters .",
    "these evolving colors are shown as the dot - dashed lines in figure  [ fig : kcorr ] . in an attempt to include evolution in the cww templates , we set @xmath195 .",
    "the lower solid lines in each panel of figure  [ fig : kcorr ] show the observed @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 colors associated with these evolving models ( and again , the predicted @xmath192 curves have been shifted blueward ( downward ) by 0.08  mag at all @xmath33 ) . comparing the evolving bruzual ",
    "charlot and the coleman et al .",
    "colors with the upper set of no - evolution curves shows the evolution towards the blue at high redshift . although the data appear to be very well fit by the no - evolution curves , this agreement is slightly misleading .",
    "more luminous galaxies tend to be redder . as a consequence ,",
    "a magnitude limited catalog contains only the redder objects of the higher redshift population .",
    "a curve which describes the colors of the population as a whole will therefore appear to be biased blue .",
    "figure  [ kcorrsim ] shows this explicitly .",
    "the two panels were constructed by making mock catalogs of a passively evolving population ( i.e. , the higher redshift population is brighter and bluer ) in which our estimates of the correlation between colors , luminosities , velocity dispersions and color and luminosity evolution were included ( see appendix  a in paper  ii ) .",
    "the top panel shows the distribution of observed colors if there were no magnitude limit , and the bottom panel shows the observed colors of a magnitude limited sample .",
    "the solid curve , the same in both panels , is the predicted trend of color with redshift which we use to make our k - corrections ; i.e. , @xmath196 .",
    "notice that although it describes the complete simulations well , it is bluer than the higher redshift galaxies in the magnitude limited sample .",
    "comparison with the previous figure shows that the difference here is similar to that seen in the real data , suggesting that our k - corrections and evolution estimates of the mean of the population are self - consistent .    of course",
    ", if we do not observe the mean of the high redshift population , but only the redder fraction , then we must decide whether it is realistic to use a k - correction which has been constructed to fit the truely typical galaxy at each redshift .",
    "for example , if color is an indicator of age and/or metallicity , then the results above suggest that our sample contains the oldest and/or most metal rich part of the high redshift population .",
    "if the objects which satisfy our apparent magnitude limit are in fact , older than the typical high redshift galaxy , then it may be that those objects are similar in age to the average object at lower redshifts in our sample .",
    "if so , then we are better - off using a nonevolving k - correction even though the higher redshift sample as a whole is younger . none of the results presented in the main text change drastically if we use non - evolving rather than evolving k - corrections",
    ".    to decide which k - corrections to use , we computed the color - magnitude and color-@xmath9 relations discussed in paper  iv using both the coleman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) template and the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models .",
    "the slopes of the mean relations , and the scatter around the mean , remained approximately the same for both k - corrections , so we have chosen to not show them here .",
    "this suggests that our ignorance of the true k - correction does not strongly compromise our conclusions about how color correlates with magnitude and velocity dispersion .",
    "conclusions about evolution , however , do depend on the k - correction .    the color@xmath9 relations constructed using either k@xmath197 or k@xmath198 show evidence for evolution",
    ". however , k@xmath197 yields evolution in @xmath192 of 0.04  mags , and in @xmath193 of 0.07  mags , whereas k@xmath198 has changes of 0.07 and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "thus , k@xmath197 suggests that the evolution in @xmath193 is larger than in @xmath192 .",
    "this is not the expected trend ; the @xmath192 and @xmath193 wavelength baselines are about the same , so one expects more of the evolution to come in at the bluer color .",
    "using k@xmath198 instead suggests that most of the evolution is in @xmath192 , which is more in line with expectations .",
    "we also tried k - corrections from fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "the predicted early - type colors are redder than those in our sample , the predicted s0 colors are bluer , and the differences depend on redshift .",
    "a straight average of the two is an improvement , although the resulting low redshift @xmath192 is red by 0.05  mags .",
    "if we shift by this amount to improve the agreement at low redshifts , then the observed @xmath192 colors at @xmath199 are redder than the predicted no evolution curves by about 0.2 mags .",
    "this is larger than the offset we expect for the selection effect introduced by the magnitude limit , so we decided against presenting further results from these k - corrections .",
    "this appendix describes how we estimated the line - of - sight velocity dispersions @xmath9 for the sample of galaxies selected for this paper .",
    "estimates of @xmath9 are limited by the instrumental dispersion and resolution .",
    "recall that the instrumental dispersion of the sdss spectrograph is 69 km  s@xmath23 per pixel , and the resolution is @xmath53 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the instrumental dispersion may vary from pixel to pixel , and this can affect measurements of @xmath9 .",
    "these variations are estimated for each fiber by using arc lamp spectra ( upto 16 lines in the range 3800 - 6170    and 39 lines between 5780 - 9230   ) .",
    "an example of the variation in instrumental dispersion for a single fiber is shown in figure  [ fig : resol ] .",
    "the figure shows that a simple linear fit provides a good description of this variation .",
    "this is true for almost all fibers , and allows us to remove the bias such variations may introduce when estimating galaxy velocity dispersions .    =    a number of methods for making accurate and objective velocity dispersion measurements as have been developed ( sargent et al . 1977 ; tonry & davis 1979 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; bender 1990 ; rix & white 1992 ) .",
    "these methods are all based on a comparison between the spectrum of the galaxy whose velocity dispersion is to be determined , and a fiducial spectral template .",
    "this can either be the spectrum of an appropriate star , with spectral lines unresolved at the spectra resolution being used , or a combination of different stellar types , or a high @xmath55 spectrum of a galaxy with known velocity dispersion . in this work ,",
    "we use sdss spectra of 32 k and g giant stars in m67 as stellar templates .",
    "since different methods can give significantly different results , thereby introducing systematic biases especially for low @xmath55 spectra , we decided to use three different techniques for measuring the velocity dispersion .",
    "these are 1 ) the _ cross - correlation _ method ( tonry & davis 1979 ) ; 2 ) the _ fourier - fitting _ method ( tonry & davis 1979 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) ; and 3 ) a modified version of the _ direct - fitting _ method ( burbidge , burbidge & fish 1961 ; rix & white 1992 ) . because a galaxy s spectrum is that of a mix of stars convolved with the distribution of velocities within the galaxy , fourier space is the natural choice to estimate the velocity dispersions ",
    "the first two methods make use of this .",
    "however , there are several advantages to treating the problem entirely in pixel space .",
    "in particular , the effects of noise are much more easily incorporated in the pixel - space based _ direct - fitting _ method . because the @xmath55 of the sdss spectra are relatively low , we assume that the observed absorption line profiles in early - type galaxies are gaussian ( see rix & white 1992 and bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 for a discussion of how to analyze the line profiles of high @xmath55 spectra in the case of asymmetric profiles ) .",
    "it is well known that all three methods have their own particular biases , so that numerical simulations must be used to calibrate these biases . in our simulations , we chose a template stellar spectrum measured at high @xmath55 , broadened it using a gaussian with rms @xmath200 , added gaussian noise , and compared the input velocity dispersion with the measured output value .",
    "the first broadening allows us to test how well the methods work as a function of velocity dispersion , and the addition of noise allows us to test how well the methods work as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "=    the best - case scenario is one in which there is no ` template mismatch ' : the spectrum of the template star is exactly like that of the galaxy whose velocity dispersion one wishes to measure .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsim ] shows the fraction of systematic bias associated with each of the different methods in this best - case scenario .",
    "slightly more realistic simulations , using a combination of stellar spectra as templates , were also done .",
    "the results are similar to those shown in figure  [ fig : vsim ] . with the exception of the _ cross - correlation _ method at low ( @xmath201 km  s@xmath23 ) velocity dispersion , the systematic errors on the velocity dispersion measurements appear to be smaller than @xmath202 .",
    "=    =    although the systematics are small , note that the measured velocity dispersion is more biased at low velocity dispersions ( @xmath201 km  s@xmath23 ) .",
    "for any given @xmath55 and resolution , there is a lower limit on the velocity dispersion measurable without introducing significant bias . since the @xmath55 of the sdss spectra is not very high ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : vmeth ] ) , and because the instrumental resolution is @xmath53 km  s@xmath23 , we chose 70 km  s@xmath23 as a lower limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : vmeth ] shows a comparison of the velocity dispersion estimates obtained from the three different methods for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the median offsets are not statistically significant and the rms scatter is @xmath203 . on the other hand , the top panels suggest that the cross - correlation method sometimes underestimates the velocity dispersion , particularly at low @xmath55 .",
    "we evaluate the dependence of the velocity dispersion on the wavelength range by fitting the spectra in different intervals : @xmath204     which is the usual wavelength range used in the literature ; @xmath205    to test the effect of including the ca h and k absorption lines ( e.g. , kormendy 1982 ) ; @xmath206    to test the effect of including the nad line ( e.g. , dressler 1984 ) ; and @xmath207     and @xmath208    to test the effect of including longer wavelengths",
    ". the velocity dispersion obtained with the ca h and k is @xmath209 larger than that obtained using the standard wavelength region @xmath204   , and the rms difference between the three different methods increases to @xmath210 . including the nad line increases the velocity dispersion by @xmath202 but does not increase the scatter between the different methods . using the wavelength range @xmath207     only provides velocity dispersions which are @xmath202 larger than the values obtained if only @xmath204     range is used . on the other hand , in this wavelength region , the different methods ( and measurements from repeated observations ) are in better agreement ;",
    "the scatter is @xmath211 smaller than in the @xmath204     region . in the range",
    "@xmath208   , the velocity dispersion estimates increase by @xmath210 .",
    "this last effect is probably due to the presence of molecular bands in the spectra of early - type galaxies at long wavelengths ( i.e. , to the presence of cool stars ) .",
    "furthermore , the scatter in this wavelength region increases dramatically ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "presumably this is due to the presence of higher sky - line residuals and lower @xmath55 .",
    "the estimated velocity dispersion we use in the main text are obtained by fitting the wavelength range @xmath142    and then using the average of the estimates provided by the _ fourier - fitting _ and _ direct - fitting _ methods to define what we call @xmath143 .",
    "we do not use the cross - correlation estimate because of its behavior at low @xmath55 as discussed earlier .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : vrptd ] shows the distribution of the errors on the velocity dispersion as a function of the @xmath55 of the spectra .",
    "the errors for each method were computed by adding in quadrature the statistical error due to the noise properties of the spectrum , and the systematic error associated with the template and galaxy mismatches . the final error on @xmath143",
    "is got by adding in quadrature the errors on the two estimates ( i.e. , the fourier - fitting and direct - fitting ) which we average .",
    "the resulting errors range from @xmath212  dex , depending on the @xmath55 of the spectra , with a median value of 0.03  dex .    a few galaxies in our sample",
    "have been observed more than once .",
    "the bottom panel shows a comparison of the velocity dispersion estimates from multiple observations .",
    "the scatter between different measurements is @xmath146  dex , consistent with the amplitude of the errors on the measurements .",
    "=    =    the sdss spectra measure the light within a fixed aperture of radius 1.5 arcsec .",
    "therefore , the estimated velocity dispersions of more distant galaxies are affected by the motions of stars at larger physical radii than for similar galaxies which are nearby .",
    "if the velocity dispersions of early - type galaxies decrease with radius , then the estimated velocity dispersions ( using a fixed aperture ) of more distant galaxies will be systematically smaller than those of similar galaxies nearby .",
    "we have not measured the velocity dispersion profiles @xmath213 of any of the galaxies in our sample , so we can not correctly account for this effect .",
    "if we assume that the galaxies in our sample are similar to those for which velocity dispersion profiles have been measured , then we can use the published @xmath213 curves to correct for this effect .",
    "this is what equation  ( [ appcorr ] ) in section  [ vdisp ] does .",
    "an alternative procedure can be followed if evolution effects are not important for the velocity dispersions in our sample . to illustrate the procedure",
    ", the galaxies in each of the volume - limited subsamples shown in figure  [ fig : xzr ] were further classified into small bins in effective physical radius ( i.e. , @xmath21 in kpc/@xmath214 , not @xmath107 in arcsec ) . figures  [ apcorr1][apcorr3 ] show the result of plotting the velocity dispersions of these galaxies versus their redshifts .",
    "since the galaxies at low and high redshift are supposed to be similar , any trend with redshift can be used to infer and average velocity dispersion profile , and how the shape of this profile depends on luminosity and effective radius . in this way , the sdss data themselves can , in principle , be used to correct for the effects of the fixed aperture of the sdss spectrograph .    in practice , because there is substantial scatter in the velocity dispersions at fixed luminosity and size ( paper  ii shows that this scatter is about 14% ) , the trends in the present data set are relatively noisy .",
    "when the dataset is larger , it will be worth returning to this issue .",
    "for now , because the corrections are small anyway , we have chosen to use equation  ( [ appcorr ] ) to correct the velocity dispersions .",
    "nevertheless , curves like those presented above provide a novel way to study the velocity dispersion profiles of early - type galaxies .",
    "let @xmath215 denote the covariance matrix of the errors in our estimates of the the absolute magnitude @xmath97 , the half light radius @xmath216 , and the velocity dispersion @xmath20 : @xmath217 the elements of the error matrix @xmath215 are obtained as follows .    the photometric pipeline estimates the size @xmath39 and the apparent magnitude @xmath40 from the same fitting procedure . as a result , errors in these two quantities are correlated .",
