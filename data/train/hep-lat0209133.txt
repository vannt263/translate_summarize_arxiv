    "over the last few years , qed@xmath0 has attracted a lot of attention because of its potential applications to models of high @xmath7 superconductivity .",
    "it is believed to be confining and exhibit features such as dynamical mass generation when the number of fermion flavors @xmath8 is smaller than a critical value @xmath9 .",
    "it is therefore an interesting and challenging model and an ideal laboratory in which to study more complicated gauge field theories .",
    "we are considering the four - component formulation of qed@xmath0 where the dirac algebra is represented by the @xmath10 matrices @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this formulation preserves parity and gives each spinor a global @xmath14 symmetry generated by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; the full symmetry is then @xmath18 . if the fermions acquire dynamical mass the @xmath18 symmetry is broken spontaneously to @xmath19 and @xmath20 goldstone bosons appear in the particle spectrum .    at the present time",
    "the issue of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qed@xmath0 is not very well understood .",
    "studies based on schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) using the photon propagator derived from the leading order @xmath21 expansion suggested that for @xmath8 less than some critical value @xmath9 the answer is positive with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "apparently , for @xmath23 , the attactive interaction between a fermion and an antifermion due to photon exchange is overwhelmed by the fermion screening of the theory s electric charge .",
    "more recent studies which treat the vertex consistently in both numerator and denominator of the sdes have found a value for @xmath9 either in agreement with the original study or slightly higher , with @xmath24 @xcite . finally",
    "an argument based on a thermodynamic inequality has predicted @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "there have also been numerical attempts to resolve the issue via lattice simulations .",
    "the obvious advantage in this case is that one can study any @xmath8 without any assumption concerning the convergence of expansion methods .",
    "however , the principal obstruction to a definitive answer has been large finite volume effects resulting from the presence of a massless photon . numerical studies of the quenched case have shown that chiral symmetry is broken @xcite , whereas in the case of simulations with dynamical fermions opinions have divided on whether @xmath9 is finite and @xmath26 or whether chiral symmetry is broken for all @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the @xmath27 model on small lattices appear in @xcite .",
    "in our study we used the hybrid monte carlo algorithm to simulate the non - compact version of lattice qed@xmath0 with staggered fermions . in the continuum it corresponds to the four - component spinor formulation of the model @xcite .",
    "we implement even - odd partitioning which implies that a single flavor of one - component staggered fermions can be simulated , which corresponds to @xmath5 in the continuum limit .",
    "in this section we discuss the results of lattice simulations of qed@xmath0 with @xmath1 . in our study",
    "we tried to detect and control the various drawbacks of the lattice method : ( i ) the lattice itself distorts continuum space - time physics considerably unless the lattice spacing @xmath28 can be chosen small compared to the relevant physical wavelengths in the system .",
    "( ii ) the size of the lattice @xmath29 must be large compared to the dynamically generated correlations in the system ; and ( iii ) the chiral limit can only be studied by simulating light fermions of mass @xmath30 in lattice units .     vs. dimensionless bare mass @xmath31 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 on a @xmath34 lattice .",
    "]    in fig.[fig : all_nf ] we plot the dimensionless chiral condensate @xmath35 vs. the dimensionless bare mass @xmath31 ( where @xmath36 ) for @xmath32 .",
    "the coupling @xmath33 and the lattice volume is @xmath34 . as @xmath8 increases the chiral condensate decreases ( for @xmath37 ) because the interaction between the fermion and the antifermion is screened .",
    "however , as @xmath38 all the curves tend to pass smoothly through the origin .",
    "this motivated us to study in more detail the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking at small @xmath8 on larger volumes near the chiral limit .     at different values of the coupling @xmath39 and constant physical volume @xmath40 . ]    in order to check whether our lattice data are characteristic of the continuum limit we plot in fig.[fig : discret ] @xmath35 vs. @xmath31 for @xmath5 and coupling @xmath41 . to disentangle the lattice discretization effects from the finite size effects we keep the volume in physical units @xmath40 constant .",
    "it can be inferred from the graph that discretization effects are small for @xmath42 , because the data almost fall on the same line within the resolution of our analysis .    in fig.[fig :",
    "cond_b=0.6 ] we present our results for the chiral condensate vs. bare mass for @xmath5 and @xmath33 on lattice sizes varying from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "we infer that finite size effects become small for @xmath45 and all the lines tend to pass smoothly through the origin .",
    "our analysis of meson masses and susceptibilities in scalar and pseudoscalar channels showed that these quantities suffer from very strong finite size effects and therefore did not allow us to reach such a definitive conclusion @xcite .",
    "next we discuss the results from @xmath5 simulations at @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath46 data set is closer to the continuum limit than the data extracted at @xmath47 .",
    "however , particular care is required because weak coupling data are very sensitive to finite size effects and accurate measurements require simulations on large lattices . in fig.[fig : cond_b=0.75 ] we present the results for the chiral condensate vs. fermion bare mass extracted from simulations with lattice sizes ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "these simulations were performed very close to the chiral limit , i.e. with @xmath48 .",
    "we can see from the figure the finite size effects are under relatively good control and the data tend to pass smoothly through the origin .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for @xmath5 @xmath49 , which is a strong indication that qed@xmath0 may be chirally symmetric for @xmath1 .    , @xmath33 and lattice sizes @xmath50 .",
    "]    , @xmath46 and lattice sizes @xmath51 and @xmath3 . ]",
    "in our study of qed@xmath0 with @xmath1 we attempted to establish whether chiral symmetry is broken or not by studying the behavior of the chiral condensate close to the continuum limit @xmath52 , on different volumes in order to detect and control finite size effects and near the chiral limit @xmath38 .",
    "our upper bound for the condensate in the @xmath5 case is @xmath53 and all the lines of @xmath54 vs. @xmath31 tend to pass smoothly through the origin which may imply that chiral symmetry is restored for @xmath1 .",
