    "the significance of fluctuations for the cooperative dynamics of quantum defects , spins in spin glasses , protons in ionic conductors and electrons in hopping insulators was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a more refined analysis of percolation",
    "one should include the possibility that the flows through open channels can open or close other channels .",
    "these dynamic correlations can affect kinetic transitions in a fundamental way and lead to the cooperative dynamics , e. g. percolation may occur at smaller density of open channels and become discontinuous . in this paper",
    "we suggest a simple model of dynamic percolation for the low - temperature kinetics of the system of interacting magnetic molecules and obtain an exact description of the kinetic transitions on bl . according to the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite the use of bl is more justified in our case than for the static percolation because of the similarity in the phase space structure for bethe lattice and many - body system of interacting spins . in both cases",
    "the size of the phase space grows exponentially with the system size ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 spins and @xmath13 for the number of nodes in bl with the coordination number @xmath3 and @xmath12 shells of the tree ) .    in the present work we study the dynamic percolation model on the bethe lattice and then project our results on the electronic spin dynamics in films made of magnetic molecules such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc .",

    "each spin @xmath39 is subjected to the `` molecular '' field of all other spins @xmath40 and the external magnetic field @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the related magnetic moment .",
    "the spin dynamics is associated with the spin tunneling between states @xmath43 .",
    "the transition of each spin between these two states requires them to acquire or release the longitudinal energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : magn_dip ] ) to some thermal bath because of the energy conservation .",
    "the coupling of spins to phonons usually responsible for low - temperature dynamics in dielectrics is extremely weak and can be neglected .",
    "the relaxation takes place due to the interaction of the central electronic spins with the nuclear spin bath @xcite .",
    "since in the limit @xmath44 only spins inside the  resonance window \" @xmath45 are allowed to tunnel , the approximate constraint @xmath46 determines the subspace of  resonant spins \" . in this form",
    "the constraint is most suitable for the dynamic percolation model studied below in sections [ sec : dynpercmod ] and [ sec : dynpercsol ] .",
    "more accurate dependence of the relaxation time on energy is considered in section [ sec : experiment ] .     lattice . when some of the open spins ( shown by dashed red arrows ) make transitions ( shadowed arrows for steps @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 ) they switch the state of the neighboring spins between  open \" and  close \" .",
    ", width=302 ]    the only spins that are allowed to tunnel in any given configuration are the resonant ones .",
    "transitions of resonant spins can change the status of their neighbors from non - resonant to resonant and vice versa by changing their local bias from being larger than @xmath24 to being smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] . at the same time in the new configuration the transitions of neighbors , diffused into the resonance window , can push the former resonant spins out of resonance . depending on the density of resonant spins @xmath49 there exist two possibilities .",
    "if @xmath2 is very small ( i.e. , the distance between the resonant spins is large ) , the transitions of resonant spins can essentially affect only their local environment and spins in the sample can be separated into a small `` mobile '' and large `` immobile '' groups .",
    "the mobile group consists of percolating spins , capable of making transitions in the course of system evolution , while the immobile group consists of non - percolating spins which can not flip in spite of the field fluctuations caused by mobile spins .",
    "if the density @xmath2 is large , the resonant spin transitions create or destroy resonances around them leading to the collective dynamics involving practically all spins after sufficiently long time .    in what follows",
    "we investigate the kinetic transition between these two regimes .",
    "the study of realistic @xmath38 lattice of spins , coupled by the dipolar interaction , can not be done exactly analytically and requires numerical simulations .",
    "however , we can solve a similar problem on the bethe lattice with random interactions between the neighbors .",
    "we assume that spins @xmath19 occupy all sites of the bethe lattice and each spin interacts with all its @xmath3 neighbors .",
    "the interaction constant @xmath50 between two neighboring spins is assumed to be the gaussian random variable with the zero average and dispersion @xmath51 .",
    "this assumption is approximate - dipolar interactions in a real system involve not only nearest neighbors but also spins separated from the given one by more than one lattice constant .",
    "the long range nature of dipolar interactions can not be neglected in three - dimensions , but in the two - dimensional system the lattice sum of @xmath52 is finite and the nearest neighbor approximation is justified .",
    "it is clear that the model we study and the real problem differ from each other ; however they can belong to the same universality class because the phase - space structure for interacting ising spins is similar to that for the bethe lattice .",
    "the phase space grows exponentially with the number @xmath12 of spins as in many - body problem @xcite , which permits us to neglect `` close loops '' for different evolution paths of the system in its phase space thus making it similar to the bethe lattice .",
    "as mentioned above , we restrict our considerations to the limit of low temperatures , where each molecule can still be modeled as a two - level system , but we assume @xmath53 to avoid the dipolar ordering and , consequently , any long - range statistical correlations between spins . indeed , such correlations should affect the kinetic transition .",
    "this assumption is not restrictive since , for instance , in @xmath16 and @xmath14 the regime of pure ground - state tunneling can be reached at temperatures @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively which is larger than @xmath51 in both systems @xcite .",
    "we also consider only completely depolarized system here .",
    "in the bethe lattice the spin is resonant ( open ) if its local bias ( or zeeman splitting ) @xmath56 , eq . (",
    "[ eq : molfield ] ) , is smaller than @xmath57 . since the dipolar fields distribution in the depolarized limit is similar to the gaussian one ( see fig.[fig : dos ] below ) , the fraction of resonant spins ( i.e. , the probability that the spin is open ) is determined by @xmath58 .",
    "we expect ( and this will be confirmed by the final result ) that the collective dynamics can take place if each spin has approximately one resonant neighbor ( cf .",

    "the number of neighbor transitions @xmath63 needed to bring the given spin back to the open state can be estimated setting @xmath64 .",
    "one can see that at @xmath65 the next opening of the given spin can be expected , on average , after turns of around @xmath66 neighbors so the new resonant environment is fully different from the previous one .    under above assumptions one can formulate the following model of dynamic percolation on the bl , see fig .",
