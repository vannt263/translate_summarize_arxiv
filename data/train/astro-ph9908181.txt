    "central stars of planetary nebulae ( pn ) are the immediate precursors of white dwarfs .",
    "most stars enter the white dwarf cooling sequence through this evolutionary channel ( drilling & schnberner @xcite ) . after the maximum effective temperature",
    "is reached ( 100,000k and more ) the nuclear burning ceases , the surrounding nebula disperses , and the central star stage ends .",
    "thus the nuclei of old pne mark the transition to the white dwarfs . during this stage",
    "the onset of gravitational settling , which causes the chemical purity of many white dwarf atmospheres , can be observed .",
    "central stars of old pne play a crucial role in our understanding of the formation of the two distinct sequences of central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) and white dwarfs : the hydrogen - rich and the hydrogen - deficient ( helium- and carbon - rich ) one . for the hydrogen - deficient cspn",
    "there exists a continuous sequence from the luminous central stars ( wolf - rayet stars of spectral type [ wc ] ) to the low luminosity do white dwarfs via the pg1159 stars , hot pre - white dwarfs with typical temperatures of 100000k .",
    "mndez ( @xcite ) presented a compilation of spectral types for ( mostly luminous ) cspn and found a fraction of about 1/3 hydrogen - deficient objects .",
    "liebert ( @xcite ) reported a ratio of h - poor to h - rich stars of 1:(7@xmath23 ) for the hot white dwarfs ( spectral types do and da resp . ) in the palomar - green survey ( green et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but noted a lack of very hot da white dwarfs ( the counterparts of the pg1159 stars ) . holberg ( @xcite ) selected a sample of the apparently hottest da / dao white dwarfs from the pg survey and concluded that none of them appear to have a temperature in excess of 80000k , with @xmath3 typically in the range 60000k to 70000k .",
    "however , detailed analyses of these stars were not presented .",
    "fontaine & wesemael ( @xcite ) discussed this seeming lack of very hot h - rich white dwarfs and proposed that all cspn finally lose their hydrogen - rich surface layer and evolve through one channel : the pg1159/do stars .",
    "after the stars have become white dwarfs gravitational settling causes small traces of hydrogen , hidden in the helium layer , to float up and form a very thin h - layer .",
    "this scenario is in contradiction to theoretical calculations ( e.g.schnberner @xcite , @xcite ; vassiliadis & wood @xcite ; blcker @xcite ) , which predict a `` thick '' h - layer of @xmath4@xmath5 , but could nicely explain many properties of white dwarfs known at that time ( euv / x - ray observations , the db gap , pulsational properties of zzceti stars ) .",
    "due to improved observations and increased theoretical knowledge the interpretation has changed during the last years and it is now generally accepted that the vast majority of da white dwarfs possess a thick h - layer ( cf .  the recent review of fontaine & wesemael @xcite ) . however , the interpretation of many observational results is not completely unambiguous .",
    "vennes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , e.g. , analyzed a sample of euv selected da white dwarfs and compared their results with cooling tracks calculated with thick and with very thin layers .",
    "they found better agreement with the latter tracks and interpreted this result as evidence of a very thin hydrogen layer of most da white dwarfs ( but see discussion in napiwotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fontaine & wesemael ( @xcite ) scenario makes one prediction concerning the stars just entering the white dwarf cooling sequence : the vast majority of them should be hydrogen - poor pg1159 stars or do white dwarfs .",
    "although a small number of hydrogen - rich stars in this transition region do nt contradict the very thin layer scenario ( see discussion in fontaine & wesemael @xcite ) , the hydrogen - poor ones should be the dominant species .",
    "the transition between cspn and white dwarfs is represented by the central stars of old pne .",
    "this prompted us to start a systematic survey of the nuclei of old pne .",
    "we selected apparently very old , faint and extended nebulae whose central stars could be identified .",
    "important sources were the article of kwitter et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and the compilation of nearby pne by ishida & weinberger ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central stars should be far evolved , just entering the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "first results on interesting stars were reported in schnberner & napiwotzki ( @xcite ; paper i ) and napiwotzki & schnberner ( @xcite ; paper ii ) .",
    "a spectral classification of the complete sample of 38 cspn is provided in napiwotzki & schnberner ( @xcite ; paper iii ) .",
    "it turned out that 28 central stars have a hydrogen - rich surface composition and that only seven were hydrogen - poor .",
    "the ratio of hydrogen- rich and -poor objects in our sample of central stars just entering the white dwarf sequence amounts to 4:1 , in good agreement with the previous investigations of liebert ( @xcite ) and mndez ( @xcite ) mentioned above .",
    "our result indicates that the ratio of h - rich and h - poor objects remains approximately constant during the evolution from the central star phase to the white dwarf cooling sequence , contrary to what is expected from the fontaine & wesemael ( @xcite ) scenario .",
    "since this finding is of fundamental meaning for our understanding of many aspects of white dwarf evolution , we will present here the results of a model atmosphere analysis of our central stars .",
    "this will allow us to determine their precise evolutionary status .",
    "we will in this paper concentrate on the hydrogen - rich central stars , which are the key for our understanding of the pre - white dwarf evolution .",
    "analyses of hydrogen - poor wolf - rayet cspn were recently carried out by leuenhagen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and koesterke & hamann ( @xcite ) .",
    "a review on the properties of pg1159 stars is given by dreizler et al.(@xcite ) .",

    "our much enlarged sample now allows a more meaningful investigation of the stellar evolution in this region of the hr diagram .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a description of the observations and their analysis in sect .  2 and  3 , respectively .",
    "the results of the model atmosphere analysis are presented and the evolutionary status of the cspn is discussed in sect",
    ".  4 . the evolution of the helium abundance of hydrogen - rich central stars and white dwarfs is described and compared to theoretical expectations in sect .",
    "the article finishes with conclusions in sect .",
    "we will use the results presented in this article to discuss the question of the pne distance scale in paper  v of this series .",
    "a description of the sample selection and observational details was already given in paper  iii .",
    "therefore we will provide here only a cursory overview and details on additional observations .",
    "spectroscopic observations were performed with the 3.5 m telescope of the calar alto observatory / spain and the cassegrain twin spectrograph .",
    "we performed three runs with low resolution set - ups ( october 1989 , september 1990 , and july 1991 ) .",
    "medium resolution follow - up observations were performed in july 1992 , july 1995 , and october 1995 .",
    "the resolution of the low resolution spectra ranges from 5 to 8 .",
    "details on the first four runs are provided in paper  iii .",
    "the july 1995 and the october 1995 runs used identical set - ups . grating t05 in the blue and t09 in the red yielded a dispersion of 36 / mm .",
    "tek ccds # 11 and # 12 with @xmath6 pixels of size 22@xmath7 m were used . the resulting spectral resolution ,",
    "as measured from the he and ar lines of the comparison spectra , amounts to 1.5 ",
    "1.8  ( fwhm ) .",
    "while we always exposed the region from 5600  to 6800  in the red , we needed two grating angle settings to cover the spectral range from 3700  to 5400  in the blue chanel .",
    "however , we did not always get spectra for both ranges .",
    "the data reduction follows standard procedures and is identical to that described in paper  iii .",
    "let us only remark that we tried to correct for the nebula ( and night sky ) emission lines .",
    "for pne with moderate line strengths and smooth density distributions this worked well . in cases of pne with high surface brightness and/or strong spatial inhomogenities contamination by nebular emission lines remained ( either insufficient subtraction or overcorrection ) .",
    "examples are and . in these cases",
    "the cores of the stellar balmer lines ( h@xmath8  and h@xmath9  most severely ) and the 4686  line may be corrupted .",
    "we have added the cspn and the hot dao white dwarf from bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to our original sample ( paper  iii ) .",
    "on the other hand we did nt analyse the spectra of and from paper  iii , because their quality is just good enough for a reliable classification but is too poor for a reasonable analysis . in the case of ( ) we based our analysis on the spectrum taken by liebert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , because it s signal - to - noise ratio is higher than that of our spectrum .",
    "we calculated hydrogen and helium composed model atmospheres with the nlte code developed by werner ( @xcite ) .",
    "basic assumptions are those of static , plane - parallel atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium . in contrast to the atmospheres",
    "commonly used to analyze da white dwarfs , we relax the assumption of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) and solve the detailed statistical equilibrium instead of the saha - boltzmann equations .",
    "as described in werner ( @xcite ) , the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) method is used to solve the set of non - linear equations .",
    "the analysis of white dwarfs is usually the domain of model atmospheres in lte .",
    "it is assumed that deviations from lte are kept small by the high densities in white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "model atmospheres which drop the lte assumption are somewhat loosely called non - lte ( nlte ) atmospheres .",
    "a detailed check of the validity of the lte assumption was presented in napiwotzki ( @xcite ) .",
    "it could be shown that lte is a very good approximation for the `` classical '' da white dwarfs with temperatures below 40000k . however , the situation is completely different for typical white dwarf central stars ( @xmath10k , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the higher temperature and lower gravity causes large deviations between both types of model spectra .",
    "therefore it is necessary to use nlte model atmospheres for the analysis of these stars .",
    "levels and lines are included in nlte up to @xmath12 for hydrogen , @xmath13 for , and @xmath14 for .",
    "levels with @xmath15 to  9 were merged into one singlet and one triplet level for every principal quantum number .",
    "the @xmath15 levels were split with respect to their angular quantum number for the subsequent spectrum synthesis .",
    "line blanketing by the stark broadened lines is taken into account consistently for hydrogen , lines and the resonance series of .",
    "the synthetic spectra are computed with the extended vcs broadening tables ( vidal et al .",
    "@xcite ) provided by schning & butler ( @xcite ; priv .  comm . ) and lemke ( @xcite ) for hydrogen and .",
    "we used the line broadening tables computed by barnard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , shamey ( @xcite ) and barnard et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "profiles of the isolated lines 5016  and 5876  were computed according the prescription of griem ( @xcite ) .",
    "pressure dissolution of the higher levels is described by the hummer & mihalas ( @xcite ) occupation probability formalism following the nlte implementation by hubeny et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to our analysis of euv selected da white dwarfs ( napiwotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) we did _ not _ increase the critical ionizing field @xmath16 adopted to calculate the occupation probability by a factor two as proposed by bergeron ( @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation of bergeron was not a flaw in the hummer & mihalas ( @xcite ) formalism , but a compensation for the inadequacy of the standard stark broadening theory when line wings overlap .",
    "this improved the agreement with experimental measurements and the fits to da white dwarfs in the bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) sample .",
    "finley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reported also better fit quality for hotter euv selected white dwarfs .",
    "however , the central stars analysed here have even higher temperatures , and their gravities are lower by typical one or two dex in comparison to the stars discussed in bergeron ( @xcite ) and finley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it is by no means clear if the correction factor is a valid approximation in the case of our cspn .",
    "thus we preferred to leave the original value of the critical ionizing field @xmath16 unchanged . from our experience with",
    "the euv selected da white dwarfs analysed by napiwotzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we estimate offsets of the order 0.1dex in gravity and 2% for @xmath17 when compared to an analysis , which applies this correction factor .",
    "our nlte model grids have to cover wide ranges in temperature ( @xmath18k ) , gravity ( @xmath19 ) , and helium abundance ( from pure hydrogen up to @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , to keep computational effort within reasonable limits , we did nt compute every model in this 3d - mesh , but only the needed ones .    due to the common lack of other temperature indicators both , effective temperature and gravity , must be determined from the balmer lines . for da white dwarfs this",
    "was successfully done by simultaneous line profile fitting of all available balmer lines ( e.g.  bergeron et al .",
    "@xcite ; napiwotzki et al.@xcite ) .",
    "generally the observed line profiles are well reproduced by model spectra with the optimum parameters .",
    "= 5.4 cm    however , this method failed for nearly all hydrogen - rich central stars of old pne ( napiwotzki @xcite ; napiwotzki & rauch @xcite ) : no consistent fit to the balmer lines ( h@xmath8  to h@xmath21  were used ) was possible .",
    "a strong trend is present : fitting of higher balmer lines yields higher temperatures .",
    "this effect is demonstrated for the spectrum of the white dwarf central star in fig .",
    "[ f : s216problem ] .",
    "while a high @xmath17 model ( 83000k ) fits the h@xmath21  line , only 44000k are needed to fit the h@xmath8line .",
    "this difference causes serious problems for the interpretation of the evolutionary status of white dwarf central stars . the previous investigation carried out by mndez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) restricted the analysis to one balmer ( h@xmath22 ) line only and thus failed to recognize this discrepancy .",
    "napiwotzki ( @xcite ) argued that the high temperature derived from the highest balmer line available ( h@xmath21  or h@xmath23  respectively ) is closest to the real temperature of the white dwarf central stars .",
    "important evidence came from the analysis of the sdo star .",
    "its spectral appearance is very similar to central stars of old pne . as can be seen from fig .  3 in napiwotzki ( @xcite ) the balmer line problem is of similar strength as it is in the central star of ( fig .",
    "[ f : s216problem ] ) .",
    "since is relatively bright ( @xmath24 ) we were able to obtain a high - resolution spectrum and detected the 5876  line of neutral helium ( fig .",
    "4 of napiwotzki @xcite ) .",
    "lines are very sensitive temperature indicators in this parameter range .",
    "we derived a best fit with @xmath25k in excellent agreement with the temperature determination from the h@xmath23  line ( 85000k ) .",
    "napiwotzki & schnberner ( @xcite ) and napiwotzki & rauch ( @xcite ) discussed possible reasons of the balmer line problem : wind effects , magnetic fields , pressure ionization and line quenching , deficits in the line broadening theory , and modifications of the atmospheric structure due to line blanketing of heavy elements .",
    "the authors concluded that none of these effects is sufficient to explain the balmer line problem .",
    "kubt ( @xcite ) found a moderate sphericity effect on h@xmath8  and , to a lesser extent , on h@xmath9 , too , for pre - white dwarfs with @xmath26 .",
    "these effects are considerably weaker for larger gravity and too small to account for the balmer line problem .",
    "finally , werner ( @xcite ) presented the likely solution of this problem .",
    "he demonstrated that the inclusion of stark broadening for c , n , and o lines can have a strong influence on the atmospheric structure of very hot hydrogen - rich stars .",
    "it is likely that the effect on the emergent spectrum is pronounced enough to solve the balmer line problem .",
    "an application of his model atmospheres on gave good agreement with the observed spectrum , if the parameters of napiwotzki ( @xcite ) were used .",
    "werner s results confirm napiwotzki s ( @xcite ) sophisticated guess that the temperatures derived from the highest balmer lines are the most reliable , close to the `` real '' temperature of the central stars .",
    "the reason for this behavior is evident in fig .  1 of werner ( @xcite ) , which displays the temperature structure of model atmospheres computed with different treatment of line opacity .",
    "the inclusion of stark broadened cno lines causes a strong modification of the temperature structure in the atmospheric layers , where h@xmath8  and h@xmath9  are formed , while the change in the deeper layers , where h@xmath21  and h@xmath23  are formed is negligible .    however , to apply this procedure the abundances of c , n , and o need to be known which is not the case for our sample .",
    "in addition the computation of a nlte model grid accounting for the influence of c , n , and o in the above described manner requires very large amounts of computer time , hence we analysed the cspn with our atmospheres containing only h and he . since the balmer line fits result in the same gravity for every balmer line ( within the error limits ) we used the following recipe :",
    "@xmath27 was computed from the average of all balmer lines and @xmath17 was derived from the fit of h@xmath21  ( and h@xmath23  if available ) with @xmath27 fixed at the average value .",
    "the temperatures derived in our early analyses ( napiwotzki & schnberner @xcite and partly in napiwotzki @xcite ) are often too low , because we could not use the h@xmath21  line at that time due to reduction problems .",
    "all our new analyses now include this line and the discrepant cases discussed in pottasch ( @xcite ) with zanstra temperatures much higher than our analysis results are now resolved .",
    "the line fits were performed with the least - square algorithm described in bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . the observed and theoretical balmer line profiles are normalized to a linear continuum in a consistent manner .",
    "wavelength shifts are determined with a cross - correlation method and applied consistently to each complete spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectra are convolved to the observational resolution with a gaussian and interpolated to the actual parameters with bicubic splines , and interpolated to the observed wavelength scale .",
    "the atmospheric parameters are then determined by minimizing the @xmath28 value by means of a levenberg - marquardt steepest descent algorithm ( press et al.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , an estimate of the internal errors can be derived from the covariance matrix .",
    "in contrast to bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we estimate the noise of the spectra ( @xmath29 ) used for the @xmath28 fit from the neighboring continuum of each line .",
    "the s / n is adopted to be constant throughout the line .",
    "line cores , which show some remaining contamination from the nebula , were excluded from the fits .    in our investigation of euv selected da white dwarfs (",
    "napiwotzki et al.@xcite ) we showed that the internal errors are usually much smaller than the real observational scatter as inferred from a comparisons of independent analysis .",
    "we used the data collection of napiwotzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to derive a more realistic estimate of observational errors . for this purpose",
    "we binned the data into 5000k intervals , determined the scatter , and performed a simple linear fit with @xmath30 as independent variable .",
    "the results are    @xmath31    a moderate extrapolation is necessary to apply these fits to our cspn analyses .",
    "we took a conservative approach and assumed that these @xmath29 values correspond completely to the external errors and added them quadratically to the internal errors derived with the fit procedure .",
