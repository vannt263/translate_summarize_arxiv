    "ever since dirac@xcite introduced it in quantum mechanics in 1931 , the magnetic pole has been a fascinating object . in particular ,",

    "the first is the consideration of dyons , particles having both electric and magnetic charge@xcite .",
    "the second is the generalization to higher dimensions where the electromagnetic potential is replaced by a @xmath0form and the electric charges become extended objects with a @xmath0dimensional history instead of a worldline@xcite .",
    "we will establish the following results , some of which were briefly discussed or implicit in @xcite :    1 .",
    "the quantization condition for the electric and magnetic charges is present even when the theory is not duality invariant ( this was to be expected since  as shown in @xcite  the quantization condition holds even when the electric and magnetic charges are extended objects of different  complementary  dimensions ) .",
    "2 .   for spacetime dimensions",
    "@xmath1 such that dyons can exist , the quantization condition takes different forms depending on the parity of @xmath0 , namely @xmath12 these conditions are obtained by using dirac strings and analyzing the connectivity of the configuration space of the dyons and the strings .",
    "they are also shown to arise from the generalization to higher dimensions of the arguments based on : ( i ) the quantization of the angular momentum stored in the field of electric and magnetic poles@xcite and ( ii ) compatibility of regular local gauge charts@xcite .",
    "3 .   a two  potential formulation ( which is not manifestly lorentz invariant )",
    "can be given for any spacetime dimension .",
    "for , and only for , @xmath13 there are special self",
    " interactions for which the source - free theory is invariant under duality rotations ; there the two  potential formulation exhibits duality invariance in a particular transparent way as a normal noether symmetry .    although most of the results discussed here were first obtained using the two - potential formulation which permits a more economical analysis , we will also present them in terms of the more familiar one - potential representation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents an extension of dirac s 1948 formulation@xcite for electrodynamics with magnetic poles which allows for dyons and also for self  interactions of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is the prototype of the @xmath0form theory for @xmath0 odd and @xmath14 .",
    "the dual formulation where a potential is introduced for the electric field rather than for the magnetic field is also discussed .",
    "section 3 discusses the prototype theory with even @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is the case @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",

    "the electric and magnetic couplings are described asymmetrically : only the magnetic charge appears in the definition ( [ f ] ) of the electromagnetic strength @xmath21 , and only the electric charge enters the minimal coupling term ( [ c ] ) .",

    "we have defined h^ = - 2 . for maxwell theory @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "equations ( [ maxwell ] ) and ( [ lorentz ] ) arise from extremization of the action with respect to the vector potential @xmath35 and the particles coordinates @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "extremization of the action with respect to the string coordinates yields no equation provided the string attached to particle @xmath25 passes through no other particle (  dirac veto \" ) .",
    "this remains true even if each particle has both electric and magnetic charge .",
    "the original dirac veto stated that the dirac string of a magnetic pole can not pass through an electric charge .",
    "one can verify that the argument remains valid for dyons in the form just stated .",
    "the analysis follows , step by step , that of @xcite .",
    "the only difference is the appearance of a term of the form @xmath37 in the variation of the action with respect to the string coordinates .",

    "thus , the whole expression is actually zero because @xmath43 is antisymmetric in @xmath44 , @xmath45 , while the product @xmath46 is symmetric .",

    "n g_n dz^_n ^4(x - z_n ) ,      we now derive the quantization condition for the dyon charges , following dirac s argument@xcite for  pure \" sources based on the unobservability of the strings .",
    "the extension to dyons presents no difficulty if one takes proper account of the multiple  connectedness of the configuration space of the strings and charges : we shall give it in detail here , not having seen it in the literature .",
    "it is convenient to choose as time coordinate on the strings the zeroth coordinate @xmath48 itself , @xmath49 .",

    "the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath52 follows from integrating the quantum constraints , = -[magnetic ] in the configuration space of the string coordinates , the particle coordinates and the vector potential .",
    "this space is not simply connected , because of the dirac veto , and the general requirement is : circling a loop in configuration space which is contractible to a point , the wave function must return to itself .",
    "if the loop is not contractible the wave functions need not be single  valued , but must just form a representation of the fundamental homotopy group @xmath53@xcite .",

    "the two strings rotate out of the sheet and the first string is behind the second string , so that they never touch .",
    "the simultaneous @xmath56 turn of both strings (  double - pass \" ) is a closed contractible loop in the configuration space of the strings _ and _ the particles .",
    "by contrast , the turn of a single string is _ not _ contractible in the space defined by the vetos .    since the double - pass is contractible",
    ", the phase picked up by the wave function should be a multiple of @xmath56 .",
    "in that motion , the rotation of the string attached to the first dyon brings in the phase @xmath57 because of ( [ magnetic ] ) and the gauss constraint @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , the rotation of the string attached to the second dyon brings in the phase @xmath59 , with a minus sign because the orientations of the two - surfaces swept out by the strings in their turning are opposite .",
    "hence , the total phase is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "single - valuedness of the wave function for this contractible motion implies the dirac quantization condition @xcite ,        note that if the first dyon is purely magnetic ( @xmath61 ) and the second purely electric ( @xmath62 )  the case considered by dirac  , the phase is entirely accounted for by the motion of the string attached to the magnetic pole .",
    "in fact , the constraint ( [ magnetic ] ) , which involves only the magnetic couplings , obviously implies that the wave function should not depend on the coordinates of strings attached to purely electric particles since it reduces to @xmath63 ( for particle @xmath25 purely electric ) .",
    "it is thus clear that no non - trivial phase can be generated by a motion of these strings .",
    "one can thus drop them altogether , in agreement with the original treatment by dirac in which no string was ever attached to purely electrically charged particles . in the configuration space where the electric poles carry no string , the motion of figure 1 ",
    "in which there is now only one string  becomes contractible , because one can now move the magnetic pole without restriction [ the restriction that it must avoid the string attached to the electric particle is absent ] .",
    "thus it is legitimate  and actually mandatory  to require that the phase @xmath64 associated with that single motion should be a multiple of @xmath56 , in agreement with what ( [ eg ] ) reduces to in this case .",
    "by contrast , it would be wrong to require that the phase picked up by the wave function in the rotation of a single string is a multiple of @xmath56 for generic dyons because that motion is not homotopic to the trivial motion : only the double - pass is .",
    "the phase around a non - contractible loop depends in fact on the chosen representation and is equal , as we have seen , to @xmath64 or @xmath65 , which are in general not integer multiples of @xmath56 ( only ( [ eg ] ) holds ) .      in the above treatment",

    "the displacement of string 1 around dyon 2 generates a surface with the topology of a two  sphere , which bounds a three  ball with positive orientation relative to dx^1dx^2 dx^3 [ a1 ]  , whereas the orientation associated with the displacement around dyon 1 is the same as dx^1dx^2 ( -dx^3 ) = - dx^1dx^2 dx^3  .",
    "[ a2 ] the @xmath188 in ( [ a2 ] ) instead of the @xmath189 in ( [ a1 ] ) reflects the dirac strings going from 2 to 1 being oriented opposite to that going from 1 to 2 .",

    "the orientation of the sphere linking dyon 2 may be taken to be positive relative to dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 dx^4 dx^5  , [ a3 ] whereas for the sphere linking dyon 1 we have dx^1 dx^2 ( -dx^3 ) dx^5 dx^4 = + dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 dx^4 dx^5  .",
    "[ a4 ]    also as before , we have replaced @xmath195 in ( [ a3 ] ) by @xmath188 in ( [ a4 ] ) , because exchanging the dyons reverses the orientation of the coordinate along the line that joins them and we have taken @xmath196 with the same sign in both cases by definition of the double pass .",
    "there is now , however , a new feature , which is the exchange of the @xmath197 and @xmath198 coming from the exchange of the dyons . due to this , the surfaces have the same orientation , giving rise to the symmetric quantization indicated in text .",

    "let @xmath204 be the minimum value for the electric charge .",
    "then , the quantization condition shows that the magnetic charge of dyons is an integer multiple of @xmath207 , e_0 g = 2 n .",

    "since the quantization condition for a single dyon is non - empty , and reads @xmath209 , the electric charge @xmath210 carried by this dyon should fulfill 2 e = m e_0 , [ elementarycharge ] as announced .",
    "if the integer @xmath211 in ( [ elementarycharge ] ) is even , then the electric charge carried by any dyon must be an integer multiple of @xmath204 .",
    "this follows from the quantization applied to the above  reference \" dyon and any other dyon .",
    "the charges of a general dyon are thus given by @xmath212 with @xmath213 , @xmath214 integers .",
    "if , on the other hand , the integer @xmath211 is odd , so that the above dyon has an electric charge which is a half - integer multiple of @xmath204 , then , all dyons with odd magnetic charge have also an electric charge that is a half - integer multiple of @xmath204 , while all dyons with even magnetic charge have an electric charge which is an integer multiple of @xmath204 .    in d=4 , one may shift the electric charge of dyons by adding a cp - violating term @xmath215 to the action @xcite .",
    "this possibility does not exist in d=4 @xmath216 because the curvature form @xmath73 is then of odd degree , so that @xmath217 is identically zero .",
    "the quantization condition for the product of electric and magnetic charges has a very appealing physical basis @xcite in terms of the spectrum of the angular momentum operator .",
    "we show here how this argument extends to dyons in higher dimensions and especially how it brings in the two different types of quantization for even or odd @xmath0 in a natural way .",
    "recall that in d=2(@xmath0 + 1 ) , the electric and magnetic fields are spatial @xmath0-forms and their sources are ( @xmath0 - 1 ) spatial extended objects .",

    "thus there is a striking difference between an electric pole and a magnetic pole which are very close to each other and a dyon where the two poles are at the same point .",
    "the angular momentum is antisymmetric under the exchange of the two poles , which amounts to exchange of * e * and * b * ; therefore if we have two dyons , the angular momentum will be given by @xmath223 for dyons of charge @xmath54 and @xmath55 , located at @xmath224 and @xmath219 respectively .",

    "the integral in ( [ j12 ] ) has the key property that upon integration over one of the @xmath245 and one of the @xmath246 coordinates it yields ( up to a sign , which depends on the choice of orientation ) , the same expression with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath233 .",
    "this follows from @xmath247 hence the result for the calculation of the angular momentum of an electric pole of charge @xmath210 and a magnetic pole of charge @xmath218 is ( up to a sign ) the same for all dimensions .",
    "the symmetry of the angular momentum under the exchange of the two poles is now @xmath203 as can be seen from ( [ int ] ) .",
    "this shows that the quantization condition for dyons is symmetric for even @xmath0 and antisymmetric for odd @xmath0 .",
    "it is of interest to point out that again the integral ( [ int ] ) is independent of the distance @xmath116 between the poles as long as @xmath116 is different from zero .",

    "we will carry out the discussion for @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward@xcite .",
