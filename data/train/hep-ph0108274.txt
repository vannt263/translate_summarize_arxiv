    "while the forward - backward asymmetry in the high di - lepton invariant mass region at the tevatron is nearly constant , it increases significantly with @xmath20 at the lhc . for growing di - lepton invariant masses",
    ", the average fraction @xmath10 of the proton momentum carried by the quarks increases , and , as discussed before , this leads to larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "the large difference in the magnitude of @xmath5 for electrons and muons is due to the fact that one of the electrons may have rapidity up to @xmath285 , whereas both muons have to be in the range @xmath286 .    while the non - factorizable weak corrections to the forward - backward asymmetry increase in magnitude with energy , they are significantly smaller than for the di - lepton invariant mass distribution",
    "this is mostly due to an accidental cancellation of the box diagrams and the @xmath6 contributions to the vertex corrections  @xcite .",
    "drell - yan production in hadronic collisions is an important process . with the anticipated large data sets from run  ii of the tevatron and the lhc , it is vital to understand higher order qcd and electroweak radiative corrections . in this paper",
    "we have presented a calculation of the @xmath0 corrections to @xmath18 based on the complete set of one - loop feynman diagrams contributing to di - lepton production .",
    "in addition , our calculation takes into account the effects of the @xmath22 corrections on @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the calculation is based on a combination of analytic and monte carlo integration techniques .",
    "lepton mass effects are included in the approximation where only mass singular terms originating from the collinear singularity associated with final state photon radiation are retained .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences associated with the virtual corrections are regularized using dimensional regularization and the on - shell renormalization scheme  @xcite .",
    "a previous calculation took the @xmath0 qed corrections into account  @xcite , but ignored the effects of non - universal weak corrections .",
    "the electroweak @xmath0 corrections to neutral - current drell - yan production naturally decompose into qed and weak contributions which are separately gauge invariant .",
    "the qed corrections can be further divided into gauge invariant subsets corresponding to initial and final - state radiation .",
    "the collinear singularities associated with initial state photon radiation are universal to all orders in perturbation theory and can be absorbed by a redefinition of the parton distribution functions .",
    "the weak corrections can be written in form of momentum dependent effective vector and axial - vector couplings , and contributions from @xmath172 and @xmath245 box diagrams .",
    "since the phenomenological implications of the qed corrections were discussed in an earlier paper  @xcite , we concentrated on the effect of the weak corrections on the di - lepton invariant mass distribution and the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the weak corrections were found to enhance the cross section in the @xmath4 peak region by about 1% .",
    "in contrast , qed corrections reduce the cross section in this region by several percent with the exact amount depending on the flavor of the charged lepton in the final state , and the lepton identification requirements imposed . since",
    "the weak corrections are non - uniform in the vicinity of the @xmath4 peak , they are expected to shift the @xmath4 boson mass extracted from data by several mev .",
    "comparison with the expected statistical precision of about 0.2% ( 0.05% ) for the cross section in the @xmath4 peak region for 2  fb@xmath17 ( 10  fb@xmath17 ) at the tevatron ( lhc ) shows that it will be necessary to take the weak corrections into account when one uses observables such as the @xmath4 boson cross section or the @xmath287 cross section ratio to confront data and sm predictions , or when calibrating detector components using @xmath4 data .",
    "the non - universal weak corrections were found to have only a small effect on the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath232  gev .",
    "however , threshold effects associated with the @xmath172 box diagrams lead a characteristic peak in @xmath5 at @xmath7  gev .",
    "unfortunately , the size of this footprint of non - factorizable weak corrections is small , and thus will be difficult to observe both at the tevatron and the lhc .    in the @xmath4 peak region , the forward - backward asymmetry provides a tool to measure the effective weak mixing angle .",
    "electroweak corrections were found to shift @xmath288 by an amount similar to or larger than the uncertainty expected in future tevatron and lhc experiments , and thus can not be neglected when extracting the effective weak mixing angle from data .",
    "the non - universal weak corrections , however , contribute only @xmath289 to the shift .",
    "the non - factorizable weak corrections to the di - lepton invariant mass distribution and the forward - backward asymmetry were found to increase rapidly with @xmath20 .",
    "this is due to the presence of sudakov - like electroweak logarithms of the form @xmath33 ( @xmath290 ) . while these corrections are of moderate size ( typically a few percent ) for di - lepton invariant masses accessible at the tevatron , they become very large for masses in the tev region which play an important role in new physics searches at the lhc . for @xmath291  tev ,",
    "the nonfactorizable weak corrections reduce the cross section at the lhc by about 12% .",
    "when qed corrections are taken into account , the differential cross section may be reduced by as much as 40% ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "the strong increase of the non - factorizable weak corrections with the di - lepton invariant mass requires that these corrections be resummed .",
    "several calculations of the resummed cross section for fermion pair production in @xmath21 collisions have been carried out recently  @xcite , however , no such calculation exists yet for di - lepton production in hadronic collisions .",
    "while the electroweak radiative corrections to the di - lepton invariant mass distribution at high values of @xmath20 are very large , they were found to be numerically less important in the forward - backward asymmetry .",
