    "as the mathematical methodology of formal concept analysis ( fca ) is little known within systems biology , we give a short overview of its history and purposes . during the early years 1980",
    ", fca emerged within the community of set and order theorists , algebraists and discrete mathematicians .",
    "its first aim was to find a new , concrete and meaningful approach to the understanding of complete lattices ( ordered sets such that for every subset the supremum and the infimum exist ) .",
    "the following discovery showed to be very fruitful : every complete lattice is representable as a hierarchy of concepts , which were conceived as sets of objects sharing a maximal set of attributes .",
    "this paved the way for using the developed field of lattice theory for a transparent and complete representation of very different types of knowledge .",
    "fca was inspired by the pedagogue hartmut von hentig @xcite and his program of restructuring sciences , with a view to interdisciplinary collaboration and democratic control .",
    "the philosophical background goes back to charles s. peirce ( 1839 - 1914 ) , who condensed some of his main ideas to the pragmatic maxim :    in that tradition , fca aims at unfolding the observable , elementary properties defining the objects subsumed by scientific concepts .",
    "if applied to temporal transitions , effects of homogeneous classes of states can be modeled and predicted in a clear and concise manner .",
    "thus fca seems to be appropriate to describe causality - and the limits of its understanding .    at present , fca is a richly developed mathematical theory , and there are practical applications in various fields as data and text mining , knowledge management , semantic web , software engineering or economics @xcite .",
    "fca has been used for the analysis of gene expression data in @xcite and @xcite , but this is the first approach of applying it to model ( gene ) regulatory networks .",
    "the mathematical framework of fca is very general and open , such that multifarious refinements are possible , according to current approaches of modeling dynamics within systems biology . on the other hand",
    ", we developed a formal structure for general discrete temporal transitions .",
    "they occur in a variety of domains : control of engineering processes , development of the values of variables or objects in a computer program , change of interactions in social networks , a piece of music , etc .    in this paper ,",
    "however , the examples are uniquely biological .",
    "the purpose is to construct a knowledge base for reasoning about temporal dependencies within gene regulatory or signal transduction networks , by the _ attribute exploration _ algorithm : for a given set of interesting properties , it builds a sound , complete and nonredundant knowledge base .",
    "this minimal set of rules has to be checked by an expert or a computer program , e.g. by comparison of knowledge based predictions with data .    since there",
    "exist relatively fixed thresholds of activation for many genes , it is a common abstraction to consider only two expression levels _ off _ and _ on_. the classical approach of boolean networks @xcite is able to capture essential dynamic aspects of regulatory networks .",
    "our present work is based on it , which also makes it possible to use standard mathematical and logical derivations for deciding many rules automatically and for a scaling up to larger networks .",
    "nevertheless , the introduction of more fine - grained expression levels remains possible , e.g. in the sense of qualitative reasoning @xcite .",
    "further , this work is influenced by computation tree logic @xcite , automata theory and a fca modeling of temporal transitions in @xcite .",
    "temporal concept analysis as developed by k.e .",
    "wolff @xcite is more directed toward a structured visualization of experimental time series then toward temporal logic .",
    "we applied it to the analysis of gene expression data in @xcite .    in section [ methods ] , the general mathematical framework will be developed .",
    "section [ sec : results ] gives results for a _ b. subtilis _",
    "boolean network . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we will discuss the potential of the method and make some proposals for improving it by solving mathematical problems which have emerged from the applications .",
    "one of the classical aims of fca is the structured , compact but complete visualization of a data set by a conceptual hierarchy .",
    "we briefly introduce its basic definitions ; for an easy example see ` http://www.upriss.org.uk/fca/fca.html ` .",

    "temporal data can be translated into the language of fca .",
    "the dynamics is modeled by a binary relation @xmath25 on the set of states , which gives rise to a transition context @xmath26 ( definition [ def : transcxt ] , table [ tab : trcxt ] ) : the objects are transitions ( elements of the relation ) and the attributes the values of the entities defining the input and output state of a transition .",

    "we start with the examples of @xcite .    * `` for example , we know that in the absence of nutritional stress , sporulation should never be initiated @xcite .",
    "we can use model checking to show this holds in our model by proving that no reachable state exists with sigf = 1 starting from any initial state in which signal = 0 , sigf = 0 and spo0ap = 0 . '' @xcite this is equivalent to the rule following from the stem base : @xmath131 * sigf.out.on @xmath100 kina.out.off , spo0a.out.off , hpr.out.off , abrb.out.off : + spo0ap is reported to activate the production of sigf but also repress its own production ( mutual exclusion ) . @xcite * sigh.out.off @xmath100 abrb.out.off , spooe.out.off , sinr.out.off , sini.out.off + all these genes are regulated @xmath132 ( + ... ) .",
    "+    in our approach , such dependencies and mutual exclusions can be checked systematically .",
    "we searched the stem base for further interesting and simple implications : @xmath133 @xmath134 and @xmath135 are determined by different boolean functions , but they are coregulated in all states emerging from any input state characterized by the single attributes spo0ap.on , sigh.on or abrb.on .",
    "@xmath136 abrb is an important `` marker '' for the regulation of many genes , which is understandable from the boolean rules with hindsight . by a pubmed query",
    ", a confirmation was found for downregulation of sigf together with upregulation of abrb @xcite .",
    "finally we entered sets of interesting attributes as facts into the prolog knowledge base , such that a derived implication was computed .",
    "complementary to ( [ imp : sigf.off ] ) , we searched after conditions for the switch towards sporulation ( sigf.out.on ) and found the implication @xmath137    the latter four attributes follow immediately from the boolean rules , but spo0ap.out.off depends in a more complex manner on the premises .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the class of input states developing to a state with attribute sigf.out.on is only characterized by the common attributes signal.in.on and siga.in.on , i.e. the initial presence or absence of no other gene is necessary for the initiation of sporulation",
    "the present work translates observations and simulations of discrete temporal transitions into the language of formal concept analysis .",
    "the application to a well studied gene regulatory network showed how a model can be validated in a systematic way , by drawing clear and complete consequences from the theory ( the knowledge based network ) , and we found interesting new transition rules .",
    "the approach could be expanded by accounting for the change of the network structure itself in strongly different biological situations , e.g. with or without stress .",
    "thus in ongoing work we adapt a literature based network to observed transcriptome time series , resulting in two sets of boolean functions related to the stimulation of human fibroblast cells by the cytokines tnf@xmath138 or tgf@xmath139 .",
    "until now we have established the foundation in order to exploit manyfold mathematical results of fca for the analysis of gene expression dynamics and of discrete temporal transitions in general .",
    "an important question is : how can attribute exploration be split into partial problems , in this special case ?",
    "for instance , one could focus on a specific set of genes first , which is understandable as a _ scaling _ ( * ? ? ?",

    "the status of attribute exploration has not yet fully been clarified .",
    "computation time strongly depends on the logical structure of the context , and there exist cases where the size of the stem base is exponential in the size of the input @xcite .",
    "however , deriving an implication from the stem base is possible in linear time , related to the size of the base , and the prolog queries in section [ subseq : alltrans ] were very fast . as demonstrated in section [ subsec : bg ] , attribute exploration can be shortened by background knowledge .",
    "further it will be crucial to decide implications without the necessity to generate all possible transitions .",
    "for that purpose , model checking @xcite could be a promising approach , or the structural and functional analysis of boolean networks by an adaptation of metabolic network methods in @xcite . there",
    ", determining activators or inhibitors corresponds to the kind of rules found by our method , and logical steady state analysis indicates which species can be produced from the input set and which not .",
    "an exciting direction of research would be to conclude dynamical properties of boolean networks from their structure and the transition functions , e.g. by regarding them as polynomial dynamical systems over finite fields ( * ? ? ?",
