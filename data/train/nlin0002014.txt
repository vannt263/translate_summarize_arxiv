    "sixteen years ago , bohigas , giannoni and schmit , in a seminal paper @xcite , formulated the conjecture that quantum systems which are chaotic in the classical limit , generically have statistical properties of energy levels described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "while rmt had proven useful in characterizing nuclear spectra @xcite , the conjecture was quite surprising since it claimed an applicability of rmt statistics to deterministic systems with very few degrees of freedom .",
    "while some counterexamples exist ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the conjecture remains widely accepted and played a very stimulating role in quantum chaos studies ( see for reviews @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the symmetries of a given strongly chaotic system , the statistical properties of its quantum spectrum fall into one of the three classes known from rmt : orthogonal , unitary and symplectic .",
    "the orthogonal class is associated with hamiltonians invariant with respect to some anti - unitary symmetry .",
    "typically this is true for time - reversal invariant systems , but also for more complicated anti - unitary symmetry ( generalized time - reversal symmetry ) as the product of a time - reversal with some discrete reflection . roughly speaking",
    ", this happens if a basis can be chosen where the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are all real .",
    "the corresponding statistical ensemble of ( real symmetric ) random matrices is referred to as the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) . in the absence of any anti - unitary symmetry",
    ", the corresponding class of complex hermitian matrices is known as the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "finally , specific considerations apply to half - integer spin systems with ( generalized ) time - reversal symmetry . indeed , the energy levels of these systems are systematically two - fold degenerate ( this is the well - known kramers degeneracy ) . in the presence of a geometrical symmetry like azimuthal symmetry ,",
    "the kramers degeneracy is hidden and the goe statistics apply . with no geometrical symmetries ,",
    "the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) has to be used .",
    "all these three classes of systems are characterized by level repulsion , that is zero probability of observing accidentally degenerate energy levels .",
    "this is to be contrasted with a generic behaviour of multidimensional integrable systems where close lying levels are uncorrelated and obey a poisson statistics @xcite . for a generic hamiltonian system ,",
    "where typically chaotic and regular motions coexist , the statistical properties of energy levels are not universal and are expected to be intermediate between the two limiting cases , poisson and rmt .    while the conjecture has been tested on a number of theoretical models ( we refer the reader to reviews @xcite rather than numerous original papers ) , experimental verifications are much less abundant and restricted fully , as far as we know , to the orthogonal universality class @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that most experimental results are obtained for atomic and molecular spectra . in the presence of a uniform magnetic field",
    ", the time - reversal symmetry is broken , but a anti - unitary symmetry persists@xcite .",
    "thus , observing gue statistics should require well controlled inhomogeneous fields on the atomic scale , which has not been achieved .",
    "an alternative is to study the eigenmodes not of the schrdinger equation , but of a different although similar wave equation .",
    "the best examples are two - dimensional microwave billiards ( in fact three - dimensional flat cavities below the cut - off frequency ) where the classical helmholtz wave equation is in fact equivalent to the time - independent schrdinger equation . there",
    ", breaking of the time reversal invariance is possible by using magnetic devices and gue - type statistics have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "still it is desirable to have at hand a quantum system where manifestations of the generalized time reversal symmetry breaking is experimentally accessible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss an example of such a system . as mentioned above ,",
    "breaking all anti - unitary symmetries using static fields is not possible .",
    "hence , the idea is to use a time - dependent field acting on an atom . with an oscillatory field alone ,",
    "the product of time reversal by symmetry with respect to one of the polarization axis is an anti - unitary symmetry .",
    "hence , gue statistics requires to combine a microwave field and a static field .    the model we use , the rydberg states of the hydrogen atom driven by a microwave field , has a long history of its own . the system attracted attention when it turned out that experimental results @xcite on the ionization probability as a function of the microwave field and frequency could be explained in terms of the underlying classical chaotic dynamics which results in a diffusive energy gain of the rydberg electron and eventually to ionization@xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena ( e.g. quantum localization ) have been studied on this model both theoretically and experimentally ( see e.g. review papers @xcite ) .",
    "the first experiments involved linearly polarized microwaves allowing for a rough description of the ionization thresholds via a simple one - dimensional time - dependent model where the motion of the electron is restricted to the microwave field axis@xcite . for other polarizations ( available in recent experiments @xcite ) ,",
    "such a simple model is not possible : the simplest dynamics may be two - dimensional where the electronic motion is restricted to the polarization plane .",
    "such models have been investigated both for circular polarization ( cp ) @xcite and general elliptical polarization ( ep ) @xcite .",
    "when not only the ionization thresholds , but also the more subtle details of the dynamics , have to be studied , a full three dimensional atom must be considered . for lp microwave ,",
    "the conservation of the angular momentum projection onto the polarization axis , @xmath0 , makes the dynamics effectively two - dimensional and time dependent . for cp case , while @xmath0 is not conserved , the transformation to the frame rotating with the microwave frequency removes the explicit oscillatory time - dependence , leading to a three - dimensional time independent problem .",
    "both these simplifications are no longer possible in the general ep microwave field and the problem becomes truly three dimensional and time dependent , providing new challenges to the theory .",
    "it is this situation which we shall consider later on .",
    "however , instead of discussing typical `` large '' microwave amplitude for fields which lead to an efficient excitation of rydberg atoms to higher excited states and finally to ionization , we shall consider a `` weak '' perturbation of an atom where the exchange of energy between the field and the atom is negligible .",
    "the fact that the coulomb problem is highly degenerate provides us with the possibility , as shown below , to reach chaotic dynamics even for infinitesimally weak external fields .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem @xcite since the latter precisely does not apply for degenerate situations .",
    "those weak fields do not really excite the atom , but rather couple and mix among each other the @xmath1 states of a degenerate hydrogenic manifold with a given principal quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted , states undergo small ( but measurable ) shifts that reflect the dynamics of the @xmath2 manifold .",
    "such a situation is referred to as intramanifold dynamics ( by contrast to a typical intermanifold coupling leading to atomic excitation and ionization ) .",
    "an intramanifold chaotic behaviour is quite attractive from the theoretical point of view .",
    "it yields an effective quantum hamiltonian acting in the @xmath2 space , whose eigenvalues are the energy shifts , and is represented by a _ finite _ dimensional matrix of size @xmath1 ( modulo the remaining point symmetries ) with no cutoff errors .",
    "the semiclassical limit is realized by letting @xmath3 .    the first attempt to produce some intramanifold chaos used the hydrogen atom in uniform crossed magnetic and electric fields @xcite , which was later extended to arbitrary mutual orientations of the two fields @xcite . the authors , exploring second order perturbation theory , have observed signatures of intramanifold chaos in the quantum spectrum .",
    "however , the situation is somewhat complex : the first order term ( in the two external fields ) is always integrable ; it is only when combined with a second order term of a comparable magnitude that some noticeable region of chaos can be created .",
    "but this implies the application of large fields , and higher order terms in the perturbative expansion are of importance .",
    "that , unfortunately , has been neglected by the authors . moreover , the high electric field values used lead then to an extremely fast field ionization which blurs any long - time effects in the dynamics . especially , there are no more bound states in these conditions , but only broad overlapping resonances , which implies that the statistical properties can not be described by one of the three standard ensembles of random matrices @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed @xcite another system revealing chaotic intramanifold dynamics which does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency .",
    "this is an hydrogen atom driven resonantly ( i.e. with the frequency @xmath4 which is an integer multiple of the kepler frequency @xmath5 ) by an elliptically polarized microwave with the possible addition of some static weak electric field .",
    "the latter allows us to break any generalized time - reversal symmetry of the system .",
    "since the driving field is periodic , by applying the floquet theorem , one can find the eigenstates of the system ( the so - called floquet or dressed states ) .",
    "the eigenenergies of the system are referred to as quasienergies of the system and are defined modulo @xmath6 . as we have discussed shortly for a @xmath7 resonance @xcite ,",
    "the statistical properties of the quasienergies reveal convincingly the symmetry breaking . here",
    "we discuss the same system , i.e. an hydrogen atom driven by a resonant ep microwave field , both in the presence and in the absence of the static field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the quantum perturbative hamiltonian for our system and its semiclassical counterpart .",
    "they are used in sec .",
    "iii to analyze the behavior of the atom in a pure microwave field and in sec .",
    "iv for a microwave field combined with a static electric field .",
    "the summary and the future perspectives form the content of the concluding section .",
    "we consider a realistic three - dimensional hydrogen atom placed in a static electric field and driven by an elliptically polarized microwave field .",
    "we define the @xmath8-axis as perpendicular to the plane of the polarization of the microwave field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , in atomic units , neglecting relativistic effects , assuming infinite mass of the nucleus , and employing dipole approximation reads : h=-+f(xt+yt)+ e , [ h ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 stand , respectively , for the amplitude , degree of elliptical polarization and frequency of the microwave field while @xmath11 denotes the static electric field .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we are interested in effects due to weak external fields . in the absence of any external field , the energy levels of the system are @xmath12 with @xmath2 the principal quantum number ;",
    "the degeneracy of the @xmath2 hydrogenic manifold is @xmath13 even very weak fields mix strongly states within the manifold ; on the other hand , it is perfectly justified to treat coupling to other manifolds perturbatively .",
    "we shall do so first quantum - mechanically with the help of the effective hamiltonian approach @xcite .",
    "then , we construct its ( semi-)classical equivalent .",
    "the latter allows us to study the character of the classical motion and search for parameters corresponding to chaotic dynamics .      for any time - periodic hamiltonian ,",
    "the floquet theorem states that the most general solution of the schrdinger equation can be written as a linear combination of the  floquet states \" , which are time - periodic functions and eigenstates of the so - called floquet hamiltonian @xmath14 @xcite of the system : _ floquet ( t ) = ( h - i ) ( t ) = ( t ) [ floquet ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the quasienergy and the floquet state .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ floquet ] ) have to satisfy the usual boundary conditions in configuration space and periodic boundary condition in the time coordinate ( by construction , floquet states are time - periodic ) .",
    "hence , the floquet hamiltonian @xmath14 acts on an extended hilbert space containing also the time coordinate .    for studying the quasi - energy spectrum ,",
    "is it convenient to choose , as a basis of the atomic hilbert space , the sturmian functions ( see e.g. @xcite for details of this application ) @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the usual angular and magnetic quantum numbers respectively while @xmath20 labels the radial functions whose number of nodes is @xmath21 @xmath22 is a scaling parameter ( unit of length in configuration space ) for the sturmian functions . for @xmath23 the sturmian functions with @xmath24 are the exact hydrogenic states , eigenstates of the unperturbed atom .",
    "as we intend to describe the dynamics inside the @xmath2-manifold of the hydrogen atom , we choose to keep @xmath25 in all calculations .    along the time",
    "coordinate , we choose the usual oscillating exponential functions as a basis of time - periodic functions .",
    "they are labeled with an integer index @xmath26 and defined by : t | k = e^-ikt    the whole hilbert space of the atom + periodic perturbation system ( floquet hamiltonian ) is spanned by the tensor product of the configuration space and time basis : n , l , m , k = n , l , m^(n_0 ) |k .    in the dressed atom language",
    ", @xmath26 may be loosely identified with the number of photons exchanged between the atom and the field .",
    "the sturmian basis is not orthogonal , but it satisfies the following relation : _ n ,",
    "l , m , k| n , l , m , k n , l , m , k | = 1 [ unity ] the advantage is that , when written in the sturmian basis , all the matrix elements representing the various parts of the floquet hamiltonian have some strong selection rules .",
    "the selection rules on @xmath26 trivially come from the fourier expansion of the time dependences ; the selection rules on @xmath18 and @xmath19 originate from the angular dependence of the various operators .",
    "the selection rules on @xmath27 are far from obvious and are at the heart of the definition and properties of the sturmian functions @xcite .    if we define : h_0 & = & --i , u & = & f(xt+yt),v & = & e , we obtain the following selection rules for the matrices representing these operators in the sturmian basis@xcite :    lllll n=0,1 , & l=0 , & m=0 , & k=0 , & h_0 , n=0,1 , 2 & l=1 , & m=0 , 1 & k=0 , & v , n=0,1,2 , & l=1 , & m=1 , & k=1 , & u. [ selr ]    in addition , all matrix elements are known in closed forms and involve only square roots of rational functions of the various quantum numbers .",
    "note that , because of the non orthogonal character of the sturmian basis , calculating the floquet quasi - energies requires to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem rather than a standard one .",
    "this is the price to pay for getting sparse matrices .",
    "the exact calculation of the quasi - energies is possible only numerically .",
    "however , we are interested in the situation where both the static and the microwave fields are weak .",
    "thus , a perturbative expansion is convenient",
    ". we will now perform it at the lowest non - vanishing order for each external field .",
    "because , the zeroth order eigenstates are highly degenerate , we have to use degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "a convenient formulation is to use an effective hamiltonian which , at any order of the calculation , has the same spectrum as the initial hamiltonian , but acts only inside the degenerate hydrogenic manifold .",
    "the details of the method are given in @xcite . at first order ,",
    "the calculation is trivial and the effective hamiltonian @xmath28 is just the projection of the perturbation onto the manifold we are considering . if @xmath29 denotes the projector onto the degenerate @xmath30 manifold , it is simply :",
    "h^(1 ) = p ( u+v ) p = pvp since @xmath31 always changes @xmath26 by one unit .",
    "the non - zero matrix elements of @xmath28 are those of @xmath32 with @xmath33 thus @xmath28 is proportional to the static electric field .",
    "the lowest non - vanishing contribution of the microwave field is at second order .",
    "it has the following well - known formal expression : h^(2 ) = p u q",
    "q u p where @xmath34 is the unperturbed energy of the hydrogenic manifold and @xmath35 is the projector onto the subspace complementary to the hydrogenic manifold .",
    "explicit calculation of @xmath36 is not straightforward . indeed ,",
    "if one expands the @xmath37 onto the eigenstates of @xmath38 one obtains a infinite sum over the discrete states and continuum of the atomic spectrum .",
    "the trick is to use the non - orthogonal sturmian basis defined above .",
    "indeed , the projector @xmath29 has the following simple expression is this basis : p= _ l , m| n_0,l , m,0 n_0,l , m,0 | , and consequently q= _",
    "l , m,(n , k)(n_0,0)| n , l , m , k n , l , m , k | .",
    "the last step is to calculate the matrix element of the @xmath37 operator in the sturmian basis .",
    "it is simply accomplished by noting that the operator @xmath39 is diagonal in @xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath26 and tridiagonal in @xmath27 ( i.e. connects only state @xmath27 to states @xmath40,@xmath27 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus the matrix elements of @xmath37 are simply obtained by solving a triadiagonal set of coupled equations in each @xmath42 subspace coupled to the initial state .",
    "finally the whole effective quantum hamiltonian inside the @xmath2-manifold reads h_eff = h^(1)+h^(2 ) .",
    "[ qeff ] this hamiltonian takes into account the _ direct _ coupling between the levels due to the presence of the static electric field ( the term proportional to @xmath43 ) and the _ indirect _ coupling through all levels of other manifolds , i.e. process of absorption and emission of microwave photons ( the term proportional to @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "because of the selection rules on the @xmath31 and @xmath32 operators and the simple algebraic structure of the effective hamiltonian , @xmath45 itself has the following selections rules : @xmath46 ( by construction ) and @xmath47 @xmath48 the diagonalization of @xmath49 , i.e. of the sparse banded matrix of dimension @xmath1 , by standard routines , yields quasienergies of the system .",
    "the method has been tested in limiting situations , e.g. , for parallel weak static and linearly polarized fields where quasienergies resulting from the effective hamiltonian could be compared with exact diagonalization values .",
    "the results for ep presented below are obtained for field amplitudes for which excellent agreement between exact and perturbative results have been found in the limiting cases .",
    "the general prescription for the semiclassical quantization of a time - periodic system has been described in @xcite .",
    "recently , we used a similar procedure for a lp microwave @xcite , for a static electric field parallel to a lp microwave @xcite and for a two - dimensional model atom in the ep microwave case @xcite .",
    "the method requires first to define a classical hamilton function for which one can use the usual semiclassical quantization rules .",
    "this is done by passing to the extended phase space , defining the momentum @xmath50 conjugate to the @xmath51 ( time ) variable .",
    "it yields the new classical hamiltonian , @xmath52 @xcite , being the classical analog of the quantum floquet hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ floquet ] ) .    as the next step",
    ", we express the hamiltonian in action - angle variables of the unperturbed coulomb problem @xcite . due to its high symmetry ,",
    "several choices are possible .",
    "the standard solution is to consider the canonically conjugate pairs @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 is the principal action ( corresponding to the principal quantum number ) , i.e. the total action along an unperturbed kepler elliptical trajectory of the electron .",
    "it is simply related to the size of the ellipse .",
    "the corresponding angle , @xmath57 , determines the position of the electron on its elliptical trajectory and depends linearly on time , @xmath58 , for an unperturbed atom .",
    "@xmath18 is the angular momentum , @xmath59 the angle of rotation around the axis defined by the angular momentum vector .",
    "similarly , @xmath60 denote the projection of the angular momentum on the laboratory @xmath8-axis and the angle of rotation around that axis , respectively .",
    "the shape of the ellipse is best described by its eccentricity @xmath61 while its orientation in the configuration space is determined by the euler angles @xmath62 as defined by goldstein @xcite .    using these canonical coordinates",
    ", it is possible to write down the full floquet hamiltonian .",
    "we now specialize to the resonant case where the microwave frequency is an integer multiple of the kepler frequency of the unperturbed electron , i.e. @xmath63 . the corresponding action is : j = n_0 = _ k^-1/3 = ( ) ^-1/3 .",
    "@xmath2 is interpreted as the principal quantum number of the quantum hydrogenic manifold where the resonance takes place .    in the absence of any external field ,",
    "the variables @xmath64 are all constant while @xmath57 evolves linearly in time ( see above ) .",
    "hence , in the presence of weak external fields , the motion along the @xmath57 variable will be much faster than along the other coordinates and the secular perturbation theory @xcite can be used : it averages over the nonresonant terms and yields the approximate resonant hamiltonian of the form _",
    "sec=--^2 + f_m(-)+e+p_t [ epr ] where & = & -n_0 ^ 2 .",
    "[ g ] and = m - t ,  j= ,  p_t = p_t+ , [ rot ] the secular variables @xmath65 are slowly varying variables obtained by substracting the unperturbed resonant quantities .",
    "@xmath66 represents the phase drift of the electron along the elliptical orbit and @xmath67 the distance ( in action ) to the exact resonance .",
    "the orientation of the static field with respect to the @xmath8-axis is determined by the usual spherical angles , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the expression for @xmath70 looks complicated , but it is actually nothing but the component of the average atomic dipole on the static field axis . similarly , @xmath71 and @xmath72 just represent the amplitude and the phase of the atomic dipole at the microwave frequency .",
    "they can be obtained simply from the fourier components of the electron position on an unperturbed elliptical trajectory .",
    "the explicit , rather complicated formulae for @xmath72 and @xmath71 are given by eq .",
    "( 2.15 ) and eq .",
    "( 2.16 ) of @xcite , respectively and are reproduced in appendix a for the convenience of the reader .",
    "the last stage is to quantize the system using the approximate hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ epr ] ) .",
    "as any explicit time dependence has disappeared in the secular hamiltonian , the quantization of @xmath73 is trivial .",
    "taking into account that eigenstates of the floquet hamiltonian have to be time - periodic , this yields @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is an integer number ) @xcite which ensures the periodicity of the quasienergy spectrum with a period @xmath4 .    the radial motion , i.e. in the @xmath76 effectively decouples from the secular motion of the elliptical trajectory , i.e. in the @xmath77 space @xcite .",
    "while considering the radial motion , the effective hamiltonian for the secular part is approximately constant ( for a detailed discussion as well as possible counterexamples in some cases see @xcite ) . in effect",
    "the quantization resembles in spirit the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "one may first quantize the radial motion keeping the secular motion frozen .",
    "the radial motion exhibits a pendulum - like dynamics whose quantum eigenvalues are given by the solutions of the mathieu equation ( see the similar treatment for one - dimensional systems @xcite ) .",

    ", we are interested in the ground state of the pendulum , thus , the quantization of the radial motion yields the following effective hamiltonian for the secular motion : _ eff =- a_0(q)+e , [ semi ] where the constant terms @xmath12 and @xmath81 are omitted ( @xmath82 denotes the shift from the unperturbed energy level of the atom ) , and : q=_m .",

    "[ highf ]    this corresponds to the case where the pendulum is localized near its stable equilibrium position ( whose energy is @xmath86 ) , its zero - point energy in the ground state being calculated in the harmonic approximation ( hence the @xmath87 term ) .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath88 , another approximation exists @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds basically to a very weak trapping pendulum potential , where the motion is basically the free motion only slightly perturbed ( at second order in the energy ) by the potential .",

    "such a procedure is , however , bin size dependent and should be avoided .",
    "we prefer to fit the integrated ( cumulative ) distributions which do not suffer from this ambiguity .",
    "there are several possible choices for the theoretical distributions .",

    "the explicit expressions for the distributions used can be found in appendix b. although the berry - robnik distribution relies on some reasonable theoretical grounds while the two other ones are purely phenomenological , it is commonly accepted that , for not very small effective @xmath107 , the brody distribution  or much less known izrailev one  works better than the berry - robnik proposition .",
    "the latter works well only in the very deep semiclassical limit ( very small effective @xmath107 ) where tunneling between regular and chaotic parts of the phase space is negligible . for",
    "lower lying states , the `` regular '' and `` irregular '' part of the spectrum interact via tunneling , leading to level repulsion between states in the two groups .",
    "this behaviour is clearly visible in figs .",
    "[ three ] and [ four ] , ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "there , the berry - robnik distribution predicts much more small spacings than actually observed . on the other hand , except for small spacings",

    "the obtained fitted values of the berry - robnik parameter and the parameters for the brody and izrailev distributions are given in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "while , for the latter cases , the parameters have little physical meaning , as mentioned above , @xmath85 in the berry - robnik distribution should measure the fraction of the chaotic phase space .",
    "qualitatively , the value obtained agrees well with classical sos plots .",
    "we have also studied the spectral rigidity , i.e. the @xmath108 statistics @xcite , in order to obtain some information on the long range correlations in the spectra of our system .",
    "spectral rigidity gives an independent information about the relative measure of the chaotic part of the classical phase space . for a superposition of independent poisson and goe spectra , one obtains @xcite _ 3=_3^_poisson_((1-q)l)+_3^_goe _ ( ql ) .",
    "[ delta3 ] we have fitted our numerical results with this distribution .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",

    "it is well known that , at large @xmath18 , the spectral rigidity deviates from any universal behaviour and saturates .",

    "[ five ] .",
    "comparing the poincar sos , nns distributions and @xmath108 statistics of the calculated data , the qualitative agreement between the classical dynamics and the corresponding quantum statistical properties is apparent .",
    "the fitted values for the relative measure of the chaotic part of the phase space coming either from the nns or the @xmath108 distributions agree perfectly and match well the visual aspect of the sos .",
    "the nns distributions change a little when the principal quantum number is modified .",
    "the @xmath111 case reveals slightly stronger level repulsion ( and , therefore , a `` more chaotic '' character ) than the @xmath112 case .",
    "this suggests that some tiny regular structures in the classical phase space are not resolved for @xmath113 but are for @xmath114 the long range correlations are more dramatically sensitive to @xmath2 .",

    "this is in agreement with the theory of berry@xcite where the critical @xmath18 value scales as @xmath115 ( the effective planck constant in our problem is @xmath116 ) . for large @xmath117 the @xmath108 statistics saturates at almost twice bigger value for @xmath112 than @xmath111 again in a qualitative agreement with theory .",
    "the latter @xcite predicts ( @xmath118 ) for a regular spectrum and ( @xmath119 ) for a strongly chaotic system .",
    "we deal with an intermediate system with mixed phase space , thus we expect the numerical @xmath120 value to lie in between the two limits .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "finally , let us briefly argue what happens for larger microwave field amplitudes . the secular motion , in the weak field limit ,",
    "is determined by the effective hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ purem ] ) , which in turn is a function of @xmath121 . increasing the field amplitude",
    "one leaves the validity range of the eq .",
    "( [ purem ] ) and enters the region where eq .",
    "( [ highf ] ) is applicable .",
    "then the orbital electronic motion becomes localized inside a resonance island .",
    "the secular motion , however , remains unchanged because the new effective hamiltonian is again a function of @xmath121 only .",
    "this means that the spectral statistical properties for higher field amplitude ( of course not so big as to produce strong intermanifold mixing ) will be the same as the ones presented here . for the high secular energy",
    "the motion will be also regular .",
    "thus , one may expect that the nonspreading wavepackets predicted using the two - dimensional model @xcite will also exist in the real three - dimensional world .",
    "in this section , we discuss the intramanifold behaviour of the hydrogen atom exposed to a resonant microwave field and a static electric field of arbitrary mutual orientation .    for small field amplitudes , the effective secular hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is the sum of two terms  the first one proportional to @xmath122 ( square of the scaled microwave field ) , the second one to @xmath123 ( scaled static field ) . for arbitrary mutual orientations of the two fields , the two terms have incompatible symmetry properties and , when having comparable magnitudes , induce a globally chaotic behavior .",
    "( [ final ] ) has some well defined scaling properties with the field strengths @xmath90 and @xmath123 .",
    "let us define the reduced microwave strength = f_0 ^ 2n_0 ^ 2/e_0=f^2n_0 ^ 6/e and the reduced hamiltonian = h_effn_0 ^ 2/e_0=^2_m,0 + _ 0 .",
    "[ finscal ] the classical phase space structure depends only on the value of @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( beside the static field vector orientation and the polarization of the microwave field ) , but not on the detailed values of @xmath2 , @xmath123 , @xmath90 and the secular energy . of course , weaker fields imply a slower secular motion , but this does not affect the structure of the phase space . in the quantum mechanical picture , the energy splitting of a degenerate hydrogenic manifold also depends on absolute values of the fields , but the structure of the levels does not .",
    "the application of the static electric field allows us to break any anti - unitary symmetry of the system .",
    "it is only for @xmath126 ( i.e. @xmath127 ) or @xmath128 ( i.e. @xmath129 ) that the system has some anti - unitary invariance , under the combination of the time - reversal transformation with reflection with respect to the @xmath130 or @xmath131 plane , see eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .    in a previous letter @xcite",
    ", we have considered the system in the case of the 2:1 resonance driving , i.e. when the microwave frequency is twice the kepler frequency .",
    "let us consider here first the principal 1:1 resonance , i.e. @xmath98 . a possible signature of the anti - unitary symmetry breaking would be to observe level repulsion with stronger than linear repulsion ( i.e. with @xmath132 with @xmath133 for small @xmath134 ) .",
    "clearly , it is desirable to have a predominantly chaotic classical dynamics , as a transition from goe to gue statistics is expected . to this end , we have to find values of the fields parameters which maximize chaoticity of the system .",
    "after rather extensive searches , we have found that @xmath94 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are a good choice for that purpose .",
    "the remaining spherical angle @xmath68 determining the orientation of the static electric field vector , is used to control the breaking of the anti - unitary symmetry .    in fig .",
    "[ six ] , we show poincar sos for a few values of @xmath137 , for two cases : @xmath129 and @xmath138 .",
    "one can see that , for @xmath139 , a predominantly chaotic structure space exists in phase space for a large range of secular energies . for @xmath140",
    "the generalized time reversal invariance holds , as mentioned above .",
    "thus , to study the symmetry breaking , it is interesting to e.g. decrease ( or increase ) @xmath68 gradually , collecting quantum data for some @xmath68 values .",
    "note that the addition of the static field tends to make the classical dynamics slightly more chaotic , compare figs  [ one ] and [ six ] .",

    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ seven ] for two different orientations of the electric field @xmath141 . for each @xmath68 , data have been collected for principal quantum number @xmath2 in the range 50 - 59 .",

    "the cumulative nns distributions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ seven ] .",
    "one can see that the nns distribution corresponding to the anti - unitary invariant case , @xmath127 , is close to , but does not reach completely the goe behavior .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath143 case , the distribution is very close , but does not reach the gue one .",
    "nevertheless , the symmetry breaking is apparent and the numerical spectrum at @xmath143 shows much more level repulsion than the goe case , which is a clear - cut signature of the breaking of any anti - unitary symmetry .    to measure departures from the entirely ergodic behavior",
    ", we can also use the berry - robnik distribution .",
    "the berry - robnik model for fully broken antiunitary symmetry consists of the superposition of two independent poisson and gue spectra .",
    "the results of the fits are collected in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "we have not applied the brody distribution to the broken anti - unitary invariance case , as the distribution is defined only for brody parameter less than unity , and does not make any sense in the unitary case .",
    "the izrailev distribution does not suffer this severe problem , and contain all limiting cases ( @xmath144 for poisson statistics , @xmath145 for goe and @xmath146 for gue ) .",
    "we have thus fitted our results with this distribution too .    in all cases , the izrailev distribution works much better than the berry - robnik ansatz , presumably because chaotic motion occupies most of the phase space and regular regions are very tiny as seen from fig .",
    "[ six ] and from the values of @xmath85 obtained .",
    "the values of the fitted berry - robnik parameter are consistent with the character of the corresponding classical motion .",
    "an independent information about the relative measure of a chaotic part of phase space comes from the fit of the @xmath108 statistics , fig .  [ eight ] [ for broken anti - unitary invariance case @xmath147 is substituted by @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ delta3 ] ) ] , which turns out to agree very nicely with the values of the berry - robnik parameter .",
    "by gradually decreasing @xmath149 we may observe the _ partial _ symmetry breaking by studying the variation of fitted parameters with @xmath68 .",
    "such a transition has been analytically studied for gaussian random matrices @xcite where the two - point correlation function was analytically found for an appropriate ensemble which interpolated between the goe and the gue .",
    "a further link with the dynamics of fully chaotic systems with partially broken antiunitary symmetry was also established @xcite .",
    "these developments can not be used here since the dynamics in our case is not fully chaotic ( as seen from sos plots and the non - integer level repulsion @xmath150 parameters for extreme cases of preserved and broken antiunitary symmetry , see table ii ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the izrailev distribution is quite suitable since it should be a reasonable approximation both for a partial symmetry breaking and a mixed dynamics ( it would be possible to construct an analog of berry - robnik distribution for such a case but it would be of little practical importance ) .    fig .

    "nine ] summarizes the changes of the fitted izrailev parameter @xmath150 ( small @xmath134 repulsion ) with @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath140 it is minimal and equal to 0.85 ( see also table  [ t2 ] ) for @xmath2 around 55 .",
    "with departure from the value @xmath127 where the anti - unitary symmetry exists , it rapidly increases ( filled circles ) up to the maximal value 1.73 for @xmath151 . for still lower ( higher ) values of @xmath149 the trend",
    "is reversed and @xmath150 starts to decrease .",
    "this , at first glance , is a surprising effect ( since the symmetry should not yet start to restore ) .",

    "observe in fig .",
    "[ six ] that the sos around @xmath129 is much more regular than for @xmath127 .",
    "in order to test this hypothesis , we have used another @xmath2 value . indeed ,",

    "generally , the @xmath150 values obtained are slightly larger than for lower @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , @xmath68 starts to decrease again around the value @xmath143 . on the other hand , the dip of @xmath150 when @xmath68 goes to @xmath138 ( where an anti - unitary symmetry exists ) is faster than for lower @xmath2",
    "this is in a full qualitative agreement with rmt @xcite : for the goe @xmath152 gue transition the parameter controlling the transition is proportional to @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the matrix dimension .",
    "the size of our matrices scales as @xmath1 , so the parameter controlling the breaking ( i.e. a deviation from @xmath138 value ) should scale like @xmath155 . such a behaviour is roughly observed in fig.10 .",

    "the dash - dotted and dashed curves correspond to wigner goe and gue distributions , respectively .",
    "the fact that we observe level repulsion much stronger than the goe behaviour is a signature of anti - unitary symmetry breaking .",
    "as mentioned before , our first results on the manifestations of symmetry breaking in our system have been obtained for the microwave frequency being twice the kepler frequency , i.e. for the 2:1 resonant driving @xcite .",
    "this choice was motivated by sos plots in the absence of the electric field - see fig .",
    "[ one ] - showing smaller regular islands for higher microwave frequency .",
    "however , as we have seen above , the presence of the electric field makes the secular motion in the principal resonance island chaotic enough and in fact we get stronger repulsion for the @xmath157 resonance than for the @xmath7 situation reported before @xcite . for completeness , we show in table  [ t3 ] the fitted parameters obtained from the numerical results reported in @xcite using either the spacing distribution or the spectral rigidity @xmath158 as can be seen , the conclusions we obtain from these results completely confirm the analysis of the 1:1 resonance .    as far as we know",

    "nevertheless , this is experimentally feasible : for @xmath111 and @xmath159 i.e. about @xmath160 v / cm , the mean level spacing is of the order of mhz .    for stronger fields , our classical studies also suggest a similar behavior",
    ". it could even be that the breaking of the secular approximation makes the system more chaotic and that the statistical properties will be closer to gue .",
    "however , we are not able to show quantum numerical results as they require full quantum numerical treatment which is difficult with the present computer resources and must be left for a future work .",
    "we have considered an hydrogen atom perturbed by a resonant elliptically polarized microwave field with or without an additional static electric field of different orientation , in the limit of small field amplitudes .",
    "classically , such fields may produce chaotic dynamics in the secular motion of the electronic elliptical trajectory . in quantum mechanical language ,",
    "states coming from a given hydrogenic manifold may be mixed significantly only with each other .",
    "such a situation has been interpreted as a signature of an intramanifold chaos .    for the pure microwave problem ,",
    "we have studied two different resonant driving cases , i.e. the 1:1 and 2:1 resonances between the microwave field and the unperturbed kepler motion .",
    "quantizing the fast orbital electronic motion , one can derive an effective hamiltonian describing the slow secular precession of the electronic elliptical trajectory .",
    "for a generic elliptical polarization , the effective hamiltonian has two degrees of freedom and turns out to be non - integrable .",
    "by means of poincar surfaces of sections , we have found a range of the secular energy where the phase space reveals mixed character with a significant amount of chaotic layer .",
    "switching to a quantum perturbation calculation , we have shown that the statistical properties of the corresponding quasienergy levels reveal an intermediate behavior between poisson and goe character .",
    "for the 2:1 resonance case , the classical phase space is significantly more irregular than for the 1:1 case and , consequently , the spectral properties are closer to the goe behavior .    the application of an additional static electric field to the system has allowed us to enhance chaos in the secular motion . moreover , the static electric field , for a generic orientation , breaks any anti - unitary symmetry of the system which has a dramatic effect on statistical properties of quasienergy levels .",
    "this is the first , to our knowledge , experimentally realizable quantum system , with corresponding chaotic classical behavior , which exhibits breaking of any generalized time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we have studied the principal 1:1 resonance for two slightly different static field orientations : the first one corresponds to the anti - unitary invariance case , the other one to breaking such a symmetry .",
    "the classical phase space structures , in both cases , are similar with predominately chaotic behavior .",
    "however , the statistical properties of the quantum spectrum change from a near - goe to a near - gue behavior when one switches from the preserved to broken anti - unitary symmetry case . in the intermediate situations , we could observe a partial symmetry breaking effect due to the finite size of matrices involved in the problem .",
    "we have studied the limit of small field amplitudes as it allows us to employ quantum perturbation theory . for higher amplitudes ,",
    "the classical effective hamiltonian is known , but finding the quasienergy spectrum requires _ full _ quantum numerical calculations . for a pure microwave perturbation ,",
