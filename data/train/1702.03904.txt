    "the recent years have witnessed a growing interest towards the post core helium - burning evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these late evolutionary phases , the agb or sagb ( for initial masses @xmath11 , which develop a o - ne core ) , despite representing only a few percent of the overall stellar life , are of fundamental importance to understand the feedback of these objects on the host environment .",
    "this is because agb and sagb stars are characterised by strong mass - loss rates , which favour the loss of the whole external envelope , before the beginning of the planetary nebula and white dwarf evolution .    during the agb phase",
    "the stars eject gas with a chemical composition altered by internal nucleosynthesis processes , thus enriching the interstellar medium .",
    "several theoretical studies have presented mass- and metallicity - dependent agb stellar yields ( see , among others , @xcite ) .",
    "these works outlined several similarities but also significant differences in the predicted yields .",
    "these are mostly due to the different description of convection , both in terms of the efficiency of convective transport and of the treatment of the convective / radiative interface .    a strong interest towards agb stars is also motivated by the thermodynamical structure of the circumstellar envelope , which proves to be an environment extremely favourable to the condensation of gaseous molecules into dust particles .",
    "the surface layers of these stars are sufficiently cool ( @xmath12k ) to allow dust formation at typical distances of 310 stellar radii from the surface , where the densities are large enough ( @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to allow the formation of meaningful quantities of dust .    the pioneering investigations by the heidelberg group @xcite set up the framework to model dust formation in the circumstellar envelope of agb stars : the schematisation adopted is based on the assumption that the wind expands isotropically from the stellar surface , under the push of radiation pressure , acting on the newly formed dust grains .",
    "while interesting improvements to this basic treatment , accounting for the effects of shocks coupled to the agb evolution are in progress @xcite , this approach is at present the only way to allow the description of dust formation in the winds of stars of different mass and chemical composition , extended over the whole agb phase . indeed",
    ", different research groups have modelled the formation and growth of solid particles in the wind of low - metallicity agb stars , calculating the dust yields from this class of objects @xcite .",
    "these models have been successfully used to interpret the near- and mid - infrared observations ( mainly obtained with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ ) of evolved stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite and in the local group ( lg ) galaxy ic 1613 @xcite .",
    "an important outcome of these investigations was the characterization of the individual sources observed , in terms of mass , formation epoch and chemical composition of their progenitors .",
    "furthermore , these studies allowed to infer important information on the past history of the host galaxy ( particularly the star formation history and the mass - metallicity relationship ) and provided valuable constraints on the physical mechanisms relevant to understand the main evolutionary properties of agb stars .",
    "as we have mentioned above , these works have been so far based on low - metallicity extra - galactic agb stars .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the distances to galactic sources are basically unknown or very uncertain , so that interpreting the observations is quite difficult .",
    "this limitation will be largely overcome by the results of the gaia mission , because the parallaxes - so the distances and luminosities - will be measured with high accuracy for an important fraction of galactic agb stars , including those exhibiting a large degree of obscuration .",
    "this will open new frontiers in the agb field , because the sample of galactic agb stars is much larger and extends to a wider metallicity range than the agb population of the magellanic clouds and other lg galaxies .    in order to be ready for the gaia challenge",
    ", we have recently extended the agb models , so far limited to metallicities @xmath14 , to solar metallicity ( di criscienzo et al .",
    "2016 , hereinafter dc16 ) .",
    "in dc16 we presented the main evolutionary properties of the solar metallicity agb models as well as the chemistry of the gas ejected in the interstellar medium . here",
    "we focus on the dust formation properties and present new dust yields based on a self - consistent coupling of the wind description with the dc16 agb evolutionary models . in addition , these solar - metallicity agb dust models will be essential to interpret the rich dataset of ir photometric observations ( e.g. , from space missions like msx , akari and wise ) of galactic sources as well as the already available _ spitzer",
    "_ photometric observations of evolved stars in nearby high - metallicity galaxies such as m 31 @xcite , m 33 @xcite and m 32 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented here and in our previous papers of this series @xcite , complemented by a new grid of mass- and metallicity - dependent sn dust grid ( @xcite , marassi et al . in prep ) will allow to fully assess the role of agb stars as cosmic dust polluters , in present - day galaxies @xcite as well as at very high redshifts @xcite .",
    "we describe the growth of dust particles in the circumstellar envelope of agb stars by means of the schematisation introduced by the heidelberg group @xcite . we provide here a short description of the basic concepts upon which the modelling of the wind dynamics and of the dust formation process is based ; we address the interested reader to the previous works on this argument @xcite , which include the full set of equations used and a more exhaustive discussion on this argument .",
    "the wind is assumed to expand isotropically from the surface of the star .",
    "dust formation occurs once the growth rate of solid grains exceeds the rate of destruction ( hereafter the decomposition rate ) .",
    "the first is determined by the deposition efficiency of gaseous molecules on the already formed solid particles . for each dust species ,",
    "the decomposition rate is found via the evaluation of the vapour pressures of individual molecular species involved , under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "the description of the wind is self - consistently coupled to the results of stellar evolution : the input parameters entering dust formation , namely the mass ( @xmath15 ) , luminosity ( @xmath16 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath17 ) , radius ( @xmath18 ) , mass loss rate ( @xmath19 ) and surface chemical composition of the star , are the natural output of agb evolutionary modelling .",
    "the kind of particles formed in the circumstellar envelope depends on the surface chemical composition of the star , mainly on the surface carbon - to - oxygen ( c / o ) ratio .",
    "this is because the co molecule is extremely stable @xcite , thus the least abundant element between carbon and oxygen is locked into co molecules .",
    "based on stability arguments , we assume that in carbon  rich environments the species of dust formed are solid carbon , solid iron and silicon carbide , whereas in m stars the formation of silicates ( olivine , pyroxene and quartz ) , solid iron and alumina dust is accounted for @xcite . for each dust",
    "species it is possible to identify the key element , which is the least abundant among the various chemical species required to form the solid particles : such key  element is extremely important , as it determines the largest amount of a specific kind of dust particles which is possible to form .",
    "a list of the dust species considered here , with the reactions of formation , the key  elements and the sticking coefficients adopted , is shown in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the agb evolutionary models calculated with the code aton @xcite and used in the present work have been recently published by dc16 .",
    "the models span the range of initial masses @xmath20 .",
    "the upper limit is determined by the core collapse via electron capture experienced by @xmath21 stars . during the agb phase the stars evolve on a degenerate core composed of carbon and oxygen with the exception of the stars with mass above @xmath22 , which form a core composed of oxygen and neon ( the so - called sagb stars ) , owing to an off - center ignition of carbon in conditions of partial degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is referred to dc16 for an exhaustive discussion on the evolutionary properties of these stars .",

    "the ejecta from these stars are nitrogen - rich ( with an overall n increase slightly below a factor of 10 with respect to the initial abundance ) and carbon - poor , with the carbon content being one order of magnitude smaller than the original gas out of which the stars formed . unlike lower metallicity agb stars ,",
    "in this case the hbb temperatures are below @xmath30  mk , which reflects into a modest ( below @xmath31 ) depletion of oxygen and magnesium and a negligible production of aluminium .",
    "sodium is produced in significant quantities , with an average sodium increase in the ejecta by a factor of @xmath32 ( see figs .  8 and 9 in dc16 ) .",
    "the evolution of agb models with @xmath33 , to which we will refer to as  low - mass agb stars \" , is very different from that of their higher mass counterparts .",
    "this is because the core mass is @xmath34 , too small to activate hbb ( ventura et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this case ,",
    "the only physical mechanism able to alter the surface chemical composition is the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , which produces a gradual increase in the surface carbon and , eventually , the formation of a carbon star ( c / o@xmath351 ) .    on the physical side , the achievement of the c - star stage causes a considerable increase in the surface molecular opacities that favours a general cooling and a considerable expansion of the external regions @xcite .",
    "the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath17 ) decreases down to @xmath361900 k , in conjunction with the maximum surface carbon abundance .",
    "consequently , the outermost regions of the star become less and less gravitationally bound and the mass - loss rate increases .",
    "after the c - star stage is reached , the evolutionary times become short and the relative duration of the c - star phase is below @xmath37 respect to the entire agb phase ( see table 1 in dc16 ) .",
    "+ the surface chemical composition of low - mass agb stars is entirely dominated by the effects of tdu . the gas lost by these stars is enriched in carbon , with a maximum increase by a factor of @xmath38 achieved in the @xmath39 model .",
    "the final surface carbon abundances range from @xmath40 for @xmath41 , to @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the enrichment in carbon increases with @xmath44 because more massive stars are exposed to a higher number of tdu events before the envelope is completely lost .",
    "as discussed in section [ dustmod ] , the kind of dust grains ( i.e. , their specific chemical composition ) formed in the wind of agb stars is mainly determined by the surface c / o ratio : oxygen - rich stars produce silicates and alumina ( al@xmath45o@xmath46 ) dust grains , carbon - stars produce solid carbon and silicon carbide ( sic ) grains .",
    "the surface chemical composition of solar metallicity , agb stars is extremely sensitive to the initial mass ( see section [ agbphys ] ) : stars with @xmath47 become carbon stars never reach the c - star stage , because they loose the whole external mantle before the surface carbon exceeds oxygen . ] , while their higher mass counterparts evolve as m - stars for the whole agb phase .",
    "this dichotomy reflects into the dust composition , which is dominated by silicates in massive agb / sagb stars and by solid carbon in the low - mass domain . in the following , we analyse these two groups separately .",

    "the production of dust is modulated by the luminosity @xcite .",
    "the larger is @xmath16 , the larger is the mass - loss rate , the higher is the density of the gas ( see eq . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this favours dust production , due to the larger number of gaseous molecules available to form dust .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fsil ] , the luminosity increases during the initial agb phases due to the increase in the core mass .",
    "this trend is reversed at a given stage during the agb evolution because of the progressive consumption of the external mantle , which favours the general cooling of the whole external structure .",
    "this behaviour reflects into the amount and the size of the dust grains produced during the agb life .",
    "the silicates grains with the largest size are formed during the highest luminosity phases ( see the top - right panel in fig .  [ fsil ] ) .",
    "this is the phase where we expect massive agb / sagb stars to show the strongest ir emission , as this is sensitive to the amount of dust in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "because higher mass stars evolve at larger luminosities , olivine grains with the largest size , @xmath49 m , are produced by agb stars with initial mass close to the threshold to undergo core collapse , i.e. @xmath50 .",

    "these percentages are significantly smaller compared to the alumina dust case , during almost the entire agb phase .",
    "this is because of the large extinction coefficient of silicates , which favours a significant acceleration of the wind as soon as silicate particles begin to form . under these conditions",
    ", mass continuity leads to a sudden drop in the density of the gas , which prevents further formation of dust . +",
    "massive agb / sagb stars , particularly during the highest luminosity phases , eject great quantities of silicates into the interstellar medium ( see bottom - right panel of fig .",

    "al@xmath58o@xmath59 is more thermodynamically stable @xcite , thus it forms closer to the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "this compound is rather transparent to the electromagnetic radiation , so no significant acceleration of the gas occurs when alumina dust is formed .",
    "therefore , it is possible that high fractions of the aluminium available condense into dust .",
    "this is shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fsil ] , where it can be seen that during the largest luminosity phases of sagb stars ( @xmath60 ) more than @xmath61 of aluminium is condensing into dust .",

    "the alumina dust contribution to the total dust production rate is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the silicates , with al@xmath58o@xmath59 mass - loss rates of @xmath63 in all cases ( see the bottom - right panel in fig .",
    "[ fsil ] ) .    when comparing the formation process of silicates and alumina dust , it is important to remark that the main limiting factor to the growth of silicates is the large wind acceleration caused by radiation pressure , that leads to a sudden drop of the gas density .",
    "conversely , the main limiting factor to the growth of alumina grains is the amount of aluminium present in the surface regions of the star .",
    "alumina dust starts to condense at distances below @xmath64 from the stellar surface whereas silicates particles form in a region between 4 and 9 @xmath65 .",
    "the location of the condensation zone of silicates is sensitive to the initial mass of the star , being closer to the stellar surface the lower is @xmath44 . in @xmath66~m_{\\odot}$ ] sagb stars , the formation of alumina dust in an internal zone of the circumstellar envelope , despite not sufficient to accelerate the wind , produces a steep gradient of the optical depth ( see eq . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this increases the gas temperature ( eq . 3 in @xcite ) , moving the silicates dust condensation zone to more external regions ( between @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the stellar surface ) .",
    "this effect is negligible in massive agb stars with @xmath69 and the silicates dust formation takes place in a more internal region ( between 4 and 6 @xmath65 ) .",

    "as discussed earlier in this section , the mass - loss rate is the key parameter determining the overall dust production in massive agb / sagb stars .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath76 turns out to be only mildly dependent on @xmath44 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fmsil ] shows that the mass of silicates scales almost linearly with @xmath70 .",
    "this is caused by the larger amount of silicon available in higher metallicity stars .",
    "the trend of the alumina dust mass with metallicity is still positive but less straightforward , the results being less sensitive to @xmath70 .",
    "the higher efficiency of hbb in lower metallicity models favours alumina dust production ( i.e. , more gaseous al is available to form al - based dust grains ) and partially compensates the effect of the lower metallicity . on the other hand , the exhaustion of the gaseous aluminium available for the condensation into dust sets an upper limit to the amount of al@xmath58o@xmath59 formed .",
    "the present results indicate that massive agb stars experiencing hbb are the main manufacturers of alumina dust and silicates .",
    "this is nice agreement with the recent findings by @xcite : comparing the @xmath78 isotopic ratio in presolar grains with the new @xmath79 proton - capture rate , they found that massive agb stars experiencing hbb are the most likely responsible of al - rich oxides and silicates grains formation .",
    "low - mass agb stars produce negligible quantities of silicates and alumina dust grains during the initial part of their agb evolution , before becoming carbon stars .",
    "this is due to the low mass - loss rate and luminosity experienced .",
    "the dust formed in the circumstellar envelope of these stars is mainly produced during the c - rich phase and is composed of solid carbon and sic .",
    "while luminosity is the main factor affecting dust formation in massive agb / sagb stars , the formation of dust in low - mass stars is guided by the amount of carbon available in the envelope .",
    "therefore , the quantity of dust formed increases during the c - star phase , as more and more carbon is transported to the stellar surface , owing to the effects of repeated tdu episodes . the increase in the surface carbon",
    "is accompanied by an increased cooling of the external regions , which leads to a significant decrease in the effective temperature and to an increase in the mass - loss rate @xcite .",

    "therefore , carbon grains with the largest size form during the final agb phases , when the surface carbon mass fraction reaches the maximum value .",
    "the typical size of carbon grains is in the range @xmath81m@xmath82 m , and it increases with the initial stellar mass , because stars of higher mass experience a higher number of tdu episodes , accumulating a higher abundance of carbon in the external layers ( dc16 ) .",

    "a different behaviour is found for sic .",
    "although sic is more stable and it is formed in more internal circumstellar regions ( with higher density ) , the growth of sic particles never exceeds the threshold value of @xmath3 m ( see the top - right panel in fig .  [ fcarb ] ) , which corresponds to the situation where @xmath86 of gaseous silicon is condensed into dust ( see bottom - left panel in fig .",
    "[ fcarb ] ) .",

    "the trend with metallicity , however , is not trivial . for stars with @xmath94 ,",

    "the reasons for this behaviour are the same as those illustrated above to explain the trend of carbon dust with metallicity .",
    "in addition , a significant fraction of the mass of the envelope is lost when the stars are still oxygen - rich , thus the mass lost by the star during the phase when sic dust is formed is smaller .",

    "in this section we focus our attention on the comparison with different results on the agb dust yields ( i.e. , the mass of the various dust species produced ) , obtained using the same methodology for the dust formation model but a different agb phase description .",
    "as stated previously , we use the same approach introduced for the first time by ferrarotti & gail ( 2006 , hereinafter fg06 ) to describe the wind dynamics and dust production .",
    "fg06 base their modelling on a synthetic description of the agb phase .",
    "the metallicity used by fg06 ( @xmath106 ) is slightly higher than the value adopted here ( @xmath107 ) but the difference is sufficiently small to allow a straight comparison of the results .    in figs .",
    "[ fmsil ] and [ fmcarb ] we show fg06 s dust yields , to allow a direct comparison with our results .",

    "a common behaviour of both sets of models is the increase in the amount of solid carbon and sic produced with the initial mass . in the fg06 case larger quantities of solid carbon are found in the range of mass close to the lower threshold required to activate hbb ; this is probably due to the larger number of thermal pulses experienced in the fg06 models , resulting in a larger surface carbon available to form carbon dust .",
    "stars with initial masses lower than @xmath109 do not become carbon stars , and are responsible for production of silicates dust in the range @xmath110 .",
    "for what concerns the massive star domain , fg06 assume that the hbb is active for @xmath111 .",
    "while the production of silicates is comparable with our results in the lower limit of this range of masses , for the most massive agb stars the amount of silicates formed is a factor @xmath112 smaller that in the present models : this is due to the higher efficiency of the hbb process , in turn determined by the larger efficiency of the convective models adopted here .",
    "an additional difference between the present results and fg06 in the dust budget of massive stars is that in the latter models some carbonaceous dust is produced at the end of the agb phase , owing to the effects of some late tdu events , after hbb is extinguished .",
    "the same methodology introduce by fg06 , and used in the present work , was used also by nanni et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter na13 ) , to calculate the dust yields by agb stars with solar chemistry .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we compare silicates total dust production to the low condensation temperature case ( i.e. chemical sputtering case ) adopted by na13 , which is the same approximation considered in the present work . yet , na13 state that low and high condensation temperature approaches reach approximately the same condensation degrees during the phase that dominate the total dust production .",
    "the dust yields predicted by na13 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fmsil ] and [ fmcarb ] .",
    "an obvious difference is the threshold mass that separates stars producing mainly carbonaceous dust from those producing silicates and alumina dust .",

    "[ fmsil ] ) .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the different duration of the largest luminosity phase that is coupled with the maximum dust production phase . in na13 , this phase is a factor of @xmath112 longer than in our agb models . in the case of alumina dust ,",
    "the choice of the sticking coefficients also affect this difference .",
    "we use @xmath116 , while na13 adopted a much higher value of @xmath117 .    for low - mass agb stars ,",
    "the mass of sic is similar in the two studies , while the amount of carbon dust produced by our models is approximately a factor 2 larger than na13 .",
    "this is likely due to the different choice adopted for the fraction of seed nuclei with respect to the number density of hydrogen molecules ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "we follow @xcite and assume that @xmath119 , while na13 assume that the number of seed particles relevant for the formation of carbon grains scales with c / o .      fig .",
    "[ fdust ] shows the total dust mass produced by agb stars of solar metallicity . in order to better understand the trend of the dust mass with metallicity",
    ", we also show the results from our previous works focused on lower-@xmath70 agb stars @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the dust mass produced on the initial stellar mass can be understood on the basis of the arguments presented earlier in this section and can be summarised as follows :    1 .   in low - mass agb stars",
    ", the total amount of dust produced ( @xmath120 ) , composed of solid carbon and sic , increases with the initial stellar mass .",
    "we find @xmath121 for @xmath122 , up to @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "the reason for this is that the number of tdu events experienced increases with @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , higher mass stars accumulate more carbon in the external regions , which favours the formation of carbon dust .",
    "2 .   for what concerns",
    "the dust composition , we find that for increasing @xmath44 the ratio between the mass of solid carbon and the mass of sic becomes larger .",
    "this is because the amount of sic formed , unlike carbon , is rather independent of the surface chemical composition , as the most relevant species for the formation of sic is silicon .",
    "the agb model forming the minimum amount of silicate dust , @xmath125 , has an initial mass @xmath25 .",
    "this is the lowest mass experiencing hbb , which destroys surface carbon , thus preventing the formation of carbonaceous dust . on the other hand , the production of silicates is small , because this star experiences a soft hbb during the agb phase and the luminosity is below @xmath126 .",
    "4 .   for massive agb / sagb stars ,",
    "the mass of dust formed increases with @xmath44 , ranging from the quantity given in the previous point to @xmath127 , for the most massive sagb star with @xmath27 .",
    "this is because higher mass stars experience a stronger hbb , thus evolving at larger luminosities and mass - loss rates .",
    "5 .   for massive",
    "agb / sagb stars the majority of the dust formed is composed of silicates , with @xmath84 of alumina dust .",
    "the dependence of dust production on the initial metallicity of massive agb / sagb stars is rather straightforward .",
    "dust production increases with @xmath70 , because the initial mass fractions of the key elements relevant to the formation of silicates and alumina dust ( i.e. silicon and aluminium , respectively ) increase almost linearly with @xmath70 , and their abundance does not change during the agb evolution .",
    "the trend of the dust mass with @xmath70 is not completely linear though , because lower-@xmath70 agb stars experience a more efficient hbb , which , for the reasons given above , favours a more efficient formation of silicates and of @xmath128 .    for low - mass agb stars ,",
    "the dependence of dust production on the initial stellar metallicity is more tricky . in these stars",
    "most of the dust formed is composed of solid carbon , which is sensitive to the amount of carbon accumulated in the surface regions , as a consequence of repeated tdu episodes .",
    "solar metallicity agb stars produce , on average , a smaller quantity of dust compared to their lower metallicity counterparts .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold : a ) the c - star stage is reached later in the agb evolution , when a significant fraction of the envelope has been lost ; b ) the initial oxygen in the star is larger , thus a smaller quantity of carbon ( in excess of oxygen ) is available to form dust .",
    "in this paper , we have completed the grid of aton dust yields for agb / sagb stars extending our previous calculations to solar metallicity stars .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows .",
    "+ the kind of dust produced reflects a dichotomy ( c - rich vs. o - rich ) in the evolution of the surface chemical composition , which depends on the initial stellar mass , @xmath44 .    in low - mass agb stars , with @xmath0 ,",
    "the surface chemical composition is altered by the several tdu episodes that eventually lead to the formation of a carbon star ( c / o@xmath351 ) .",
    "the formation of solid carbon and sic grains takes place in the circumstellar envelope of these stars .",
    "the size of sic grains formed keeps around @xmath3 m for the whole agb life .",
    "however , the size of carbon grains increases with the increasing amount of carbon being accumulated in the surface regions .",
    "the carbon dust particles with the largest sizes , @xmath129 m , are formed in the very final evolutionary phases of agb stars with @xmath130 .",
    "the mass of carbonaceous dust formed increases with the mass of the star , ranging from a few @xmath131 for @xmath132 , to @xmath133 for @xmath134 . in the lowest mass stars the dominant dust component is sic , while in their more massive counterparts most of the dust produced is under the form of solid carbon .",
    "massive agb / sagb stars with @xmath6 experience hbb . in this case",
    "the formation of carbon stars is inhibited by the destruction of surface carbon via proton - capture reactions at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "the most relevant dust species formed in these stars are silicates and alumina dust .",
    "the latter is more stable than silicates , but the amount of dust that can be produced is severely limited by the scarcity of aluminium .",
    "alumina grains grow until reaching dimensions of the order of @xmath135 m . most of the dust produced by massive agb / sagb stars is under the form of silicates .",
    "the size reached by the dominant silicates grains , i.e. olivine , are in the range @xmath7 m .",
    "the mass of dust produced increases with @xmath44 because higher mass stars evolve on more massive degenerate cores and are exposed to stronger hbb conditions .",
    "we find @xmath136 for @xmath137 , up to a maximum of @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "silicates are the largely dominant dust species in all cases .",
    "previously computed aton agb models with dust formation have been able to explain and interpret photometric observations of evolved stars in several low - metallicity galaxies of the local group .",
    "the results of the present study will allow to extend these studies to evolved stellar populations in our galaxy and another high - metallicity lg galaxies .",
    "in addition , the complete grid of dust and metal yields based aton agb / sagb models with metallicity @xmath140 and initial mass @xmath141 will be a valuable tool for chemical evolution studies , allowing to estimate the contribution of intermediate mass stars to metal and dust enrichment on timescales @xmath142  myr . in a more general context",
    ", the solar metallicity agb dust yields will allow to compare the relative role of agb and supernovae ( sn ) as stellar sources of dust over a wide range of metallicity , and to assess the contribution of agb stars to the existing dust mass of the milky way , complementing the work that has already been done on the magellanic clouds .",
