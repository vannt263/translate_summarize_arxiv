    "quantum monte carlo methods have proved to be very accurate and powerful tools for studying the structure of light nuclei with realistic two- and three - nucleon interactions . in a series of papers ,",
    "we have calculated about 40 ground and low - lying excited state energies of different @xmath2 quantum numbers in @xmath4 = 610 nuclei with an accuracy of @xmath5 12% @xcite .",
    "the first step is a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation to find an optimal trial function , @xmath0 for a given state .",
    "the @xmath1 , which is antisymmetric by explicit construction , is then used as input to a green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) algorithm , which projects out the lowest - energy eigenstate by a propagation in imaginary time , @xmath6 .",
    "the algorithm preserves the quantum numbers of @xmath1 , although it may introduce symmetric noise into the propagated @xmath7 . in principle , @xmath7 for large @xmath6 approaches the exact lowest - energy eigenstate with the specified quantum numbers .",
    "vmc calculations of second and higher excited @xmath2 states have also been made , because a major step in the preparation of an optimal @xmath1 is a diagonalization in the small single - particle basis of different possible spatial - symmetry states @xcite .",
    "gfmc calculations of second or higher @xmath2 states have not been attempted previously in nuclear physics , under the expectation that any small contamination of the excited trial state by the true first state would drive the calculated energy below its proper value . however , as is described in this paper , we have found that it is possible to obtain useful gfmc predictions of multiple states with the same quantum numbers .    in this paper",
    "we report such gfmc calculations of second and higher @xmath2 states in light ( @xmath4 = 68 ) p - shell nuclei .",
    "vmc calculations of these states were reported previously @xcite , but we have made significant improvements in the trial functions since then .",
