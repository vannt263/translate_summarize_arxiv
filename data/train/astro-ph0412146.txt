    "ultra - compact hii  regions ( uchii ) arguably represent the earliest stage of high - mass star formation that can be reliably identified . as such",
    "they have been the focus of intensive investigation , particularly since the first large scale interferometric survey of this class of sources by @xcite .",
    "this survey detected compact radio continuum emission towards two - thirds of the sources searched , a much higher fraction than expected .",
    "simple modelling of hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the ultra - compact phase should be short lived and hence seen in only a small fraction of sources .",
    "this discrepancy ( known as the uchii  lifetime problem ) , is thought to be due to the presence of an additional confinement mechanism which partly counteracts the expected pressure driven expansion .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been suggested to reduce the expansion rate of hii regions , either through confinement due to infall @xcite , bow shocks @xcite , dense warm environments @xcite , turbulent pressure @xcite , or other means such as photoevapouration of circumstellar discs @xcite and mass - loaded stellar winds @xcite .",
    "champagne flows @xcite have also been invoked as a means of extending the lifetime of the ultra - compact phase of hii regions .",
    "although each model appears able to explain some objects , none seem to be universally valid .",
    "the uchii  lifetime issue has been most recently reviewed by @xcite .    a second observational challenge related to uchii  regions",
    "has recently emerged from their apparent association with extended radio continuum emission .",
    "the majority of interferometric observations of uchii  regions have been sensitive to emission on angular scales of the order of 1 - 10 arcseconds .",
    "however , surveys by @xcite and @xcite have shown the presence of significant emission on larger scales towards the majority of the uchii  regions observed .",
    "morphologically the extended emission appears to be directly associated with the uchii  regions ( rather than a projection effect ) and this is supported by observations of radio recombination lines @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of a compact , high - emission measure region within a larger diffuse , lower - emission measure zone is not predicted by models which solve the lifetime problem through confinement .",
    "it may be broadly consistent with replenishment solutions , such as photoevapouration of circumstellar disks @xcite , but no detailed work to predict hii  region morphology has been undertaken for this model .    a scenario which addresses both the lifetime problem and the extended emission problem is the following :    1 .",
    "a high - mass star commences nuclear fusion in the core and starts ionizing the surrounding neutral material , rapidly forming a uchii region .",
    "2 .   soon after , a zone of more diffuse ionized gas begins to form surrounding the uchii  region . over time",
    "the size of the diffuse region grows and the compact region begins to dissipate .",
    "eventually the compact region dissipates entirely and we are left with a classical hii  region .    there may be some hii regions that do not follow this scenario , such as those associated with later type stars that produce relatively few ionising photons , where it is possible that no diffuse ionized region forms @xcite .",
    "however , here we are interested in the large fraction of hii regions that have been observed to exhibit both compact and more diffuse emission .    we will leave aside for the moment the question as to how this scenario occurs , this is addressed in more detail in section  [ sec : discussion ] and @xcite .",
    "our scenario is consistent with current observations , as any observation made with an interferometer at high resolution during stage ( ii ) will detect compact emission and observations made with lower resolution will detected extended emission .",
    "all we require to solve the dual observational challenges of lifetime and extended emission is that the timescale over which compact and extended emission coexist is long enough to explain the observed excess of uchii  regions . on the basis of various arguments given by @xcite",
    "this is estimated to be approximately a factor of 5 ( although uncertain by a factor of 2 ) and so using @xmath0 years as an estimate for the lifetime of the uchii  phase @xcite , we estimate stage ( ii ) to be of the order of @xmath1 years .    if the scenario outlined above is correct then the flux density and radius of the diffuse extended emission will increase with time .",
    "very young hii regions will have little or no associated extended emission , while older regions will have a significant amount .",
    "masers are thought to trace the early stages of high - mass star formation and so we would predict that hii regions with associated masers should show little or no extended emission .",
    "class  ii ( e.g. 6.7-ghz ) methanol masers are believed to exclusively trace the early stages of high - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the other common masing molecules oh and water which are associated with more than one type of astrophysical object .",
    "many 6.7-ghz methanol masers have no associated centimetre radio continuum emission @xcite , but are associated with millimetre and sub - millimetre continuum emission @xcite .",
    "this suggests that many class  ii methanol masers trace a pre - uchii  phase , and for those where there is an associated uchii  region it is young .",
    "analysis of the scale - height of 6.7-ghz methanol masers in the galaxy shows that it is significantly smaller than any other extreme population i objects @xcite .    to test the scenario outlined above we have selected a sample of eight uchii  regions associated with 6.7-ghz methanol masers",
    "assuming that this criteria selects young hii regions then we predict they should exhibit relatively little extended emission compared with the regions observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "eight uchii regions associated with 6.7-ghz methanol masers were imaged with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in the 750d configuration . for the 750d array",
    "the minimum baseline length is 107 m and the maximum is 719 m. the observations were made on 1999 july 10&11 , with all sources being observed on both days to improve the overall @xmath2 coverage . for each of the uchii  regions a 3-minute scan was both preceded and followed by a 1-minute scan of a phase calibrator .",
    "over the two days sources were observed approximately 20 times , for a total onsource integration time of approximately 1 hour .",
    "the correlator was configured to record a 128-mhz bandwidth , centred at a frequency of 8.64 ghz .",
    "the data were calibrated using the miriad software package applying the standard techniques for atca continuum observations .",
    "the data for each day were calibrated separately and merged into a single dataset for imaging .",
    "table  [ tab : fields ] lists the fields imaged , the rms level in the residual image and similar information for the related 6-km array observations ( see below ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , < , > , < \" , ]     [ tab : dynamic ]    a direct quantitative comparison of the amount of extended emission in hii  regions with and without associated class  ii methanol masers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] . a sample of 22 sources has been compiled , the 11 reported in the current work and the 11 from @xcite for which emission was detected in the d - array observations .",
    "we have not included the observations of @xcite in this analysis as they are significantly different from those we report here and those of @xcite .",
    "for the current observations we have calculated the ratio of the integrated to the peak flux density for each source detected in the 750-m array observations , while for @xcite we have taken the ratio of the integrated flux density within a 50 arcsec square at the centre of the field to the peak flux density for the d - array observations ( columns 5 & 4 of their table  4 ) .",
    "there are a total of eight sources in the sample with associated methanol masers , the seven from the current work , plus _ iras",
    "_  18496 + 0004 from @xcite .",
    "_ iras _  22543 + 6145/cep a from the @xcite list also has an associated 6.7-ghz methanol maser maser , but no emission is reported in their d - array observations .",
    "there are fourteen sources in the sample without associated methanol masers , the ten sources for which @xcite list d - array observations and four sources from the current work ( marked with an asterisk in table  [ tab : dynamic ] ) .",
    "although the sample size is small , there is a clear tendency for sources with associated methanol masers to have quantitatively less extended emission .",
    "three of the eight sources ( 38 per cent ) with associated 6.7-ghz methanol masers have a ratio of integrated to peak flux density greater than 1.5 ( g308.92 + 0.12 , g339.88 - 1.26 and ngc6334f ) .",
    "in contrast eleven of the fourteen sources without an associated 6.7-ghz methanol maser ( 79 per cent ) have a radio greater than 1.5 .",
    "high - mass stars form in clusters and so we expect that for some regions the observed radio continuum emission will be due to more than one ionizing source , possibly at different evolutionary stages . considering that this will confuse the simple scenario we have outlined and dilute the difference between the two samples , the difference we find is striking .    a fundamental issue relating to hii  regions with both compact components and extended emission is whether they are truly associated , that is are they both produced by a single exciting star ?",
    "@xcite argued on the basis of morphology that in the majority of cases where they see extended emission it is associated with the compact component . @xcite",
    "made single dish recombination line observations towards their sample and found that in all but one case both the compact and extended components have the same approximate velocity . for our sample of hii  regions associated with methanol masers",
    "the limited degree and morphology of the extended emission observed in most cases strongly suggests that it is associated with the compact region .",
    "this is confirmed by @xcite which used the atca in the 750d array to make recombination line observations of the same sample of hii  regions .",
    "recombination lines were detected towards five of the eight sources and in each case the moment maps demonstrate that the compact and extended emission are associated .",
    "our results and those of @xcite and @xcite appear to be consistent with the scenario outlined in the introduction .",
    "this scenario is appealing as it explains both the lifetime problem and association between compact and extended emission .",
    "it is also consistent with the observation that the majority of _ iras _ sources with colours consistent with uchii  regions do not have associated 6.7-ghz methanol masers @xcite .",
    "our observations suggest that those hii  regions with associated 6.7-ghz masers are the young ones , while those without are likely to exhibit significant extended radio continuum emission in addition to any compact components .",
    "the remaining hurdle for our scenario is a plausible mechanism through which it can occur .",
    "@xcite suggested that the association between compact and extended radio continuum emission in hii  regions may be due to champagne flows in a hierarchically structure molecular cloud . @xcite",
    "have used recombination line observations and information from the literature to derive a number of physical parameters for the hii  regions in this sample .",
    "they have modelled the evolution of hii  regions in a hierarchical molecular cloud formation and find good agreement between the observed and predicted radii and emission measures .",
    "there is a well known tendency for the stellar type as estimated from the ir luminosity ( typically _ iras _ observations ) to exceed that obtained using the radio flux density .",
    "a variety of explanations have been forwarded for this , including that at the spatial resolution of _ iras _ the ir luminosity measured is that for the cluster , rather than for an individual star and that dust absorbs some of the uv flux from the star , hence reducing the radio flux density .",
    "our observations and those of @xcite and @xcite suggest that another factor in the discrepancy between ir and radio determined spectral types is that most high resolution interferometry observations significantly underestimate the total radio flux density from the hii  regions due to their insensitivity to the extended component .",
    "this effect will be greatest for older hii  regions where the fraction of the total flux density in the extended state becomes a significant .",
    "observations of eight hii  regions associated with 6.7-ghz methanol masers find a significantly lower degree of extended emission associated with these sources than in other samples .",
    "we suggest that this is consistent with a scenario where both compact and diffuse ionized structures co - exist for a significant fraction of hii   region lifetimes .",
    "modelling by @xcite of high - mass stars forming in hierarchically structured molecular clouds is consistent with our observations and appears to provide a consistent solution for the lifetime problem .",
    "we would like to thank marco costa for his assistance with some of the observations presented in this paper .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
    "financial support for this work was provided by the australian research council .",
