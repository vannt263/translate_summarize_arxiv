    "let us set the scene by recalling some basic notions of percolation theory , in the very special context we shall study here ; for general background , we refer the reader to kesten  @xcite , chayes and chayes  @xcite and grimmett  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be the planar square lattice , i.e. , the graph whose vertices are the points of @xmath0 , in which vertices at euclidean distance @xmath4 are joined by an edge .",
    "a _ bond percolation measure _ on @xmath0 , or any other graph , is a probability measure on the space of assignments of a _ state _ , namely _",
    "open _ or _ closed _ , to each edge @xmath5 ( with the usual @xmath6-field of measurable events ) . most of the time we shall consider the product measure @xmath7 , in which the states of the edges are independent , and every edge is open with probability @xmath8 .    an _ open cluster",
    "_ is a maximal connected subgraph of @xmath0 all of whose edges are open .",
    "we write @xmath9 for the open cluster containing a given vertex @xmath10 .",
    "thus a vertex @xmath11 lies in @xmath9 if and only if @xmath11 can be reached from @xmath12 by an _",
    "open path _ , i.e. , a path in @xmath0 all of whose edges are open .",
    "the fundamental question of percolation theory is ` when does percolation occur ' , i.e. , ` for which @xmath8 is there an infinite open cluster ' ?",
    "of course , this question can be , and is , asked in a wide variety of contexts .",
    "here we shall consider only the particular case of _ bond percolation in @xmath0 _ described above .",
    "note that the question makes sense : if @xmath13 is the event that there is an infinite open cluster , then by kolmogorov s @xmath14-law , @xmath15 is @xmath16 or @xmath4 for any @xmath8 .",
    "writing @xmath17 for the number of vertices of @xmath9 , let @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the origin .",
    "now @xmath20 implies @xmath13 , while @xmath13 is the countable union of the events @xmath21 , @xmath10 . from translational",
    "invariance we have @xmath22 for all @xmath12 , so @xmath15 is @xmath16 if @xmath23 and @xmath4 if @xmath24 ; thus , the question of when percolation occurs is precisely the question ` when is @xmath25 ? '",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath26 is an increasing function of @xmath8 , so there is a ` critical probability ' @xmath27 here , following welsh ( see  @xcite ) , the @xmath28 is in honour of hammersley , although it is more common to write @xmath29 for @xmath30 . in simple cases such as the present one , it is easy to see that @xmath31 .",
    "the problem of investigating @xmath30 in a variety of contexts was posed by broadbent and hammersley  @xcite in 1957 .",
    "hammersley  @xcite proved general results implying in particular that @xmath32 .",
    "the first major progress was due to harris  @xcite , who proved in 1960 that @xmath33 .",
    "his proof makes use of the ` self - duality ' of @xmath0 , and is highly non - trivial .    for many years",
    "it was believed that @xmath34 for bond percolation in @xmath0 ; see , for example , sykes and essam  @xcite .",
    "however , it was only in 1980 , twenty years after harris proved that @xmath35 , that kesten  @xcite proved this conjecture , following significant progress by russo  @xcite and seymour and welsh  @xcite .",
    "the proofs of harris and kesten are beautiful , but rather complicated and long .",
    "other proofs of their results have since been developed , for example that due to zhang ( see  @xcite ) , and very much more general results are now known ; however , none of the proofs is very simple .",
    "here we shall give short proofs of the harris - kesten results for @xmath36 , the critical probability for bond percolation in @xmath0 .",
    "our methods are applicable in other contexts as well ; indeed , they were developed in  @xcite to prove that the critical probability for random voronoi percolation in the plane is @xmath1 .",
    "it has been known for a long time that kesten s result follows easily once one can show that a certain ` rectangle crossing ' event undergoes a ` sharp transition ' , in that for any @xmath3 its probability is close to @xmath4 whenever the rectangle is large enough .",
    "the key to our method is a simple deduction of this result from a general result of probabilistic combinatorics , due to friedgut and kalai  @xcite .",
    "there are two other components to the proof .",
    "for the first , we use the strategy of russo  @xcite and seymour and welsh  @xcite , but give a shorter proof . for the second ,",
    "deducing percolation from a large rectangle - crossing probability , we give three arguments , one that ` happens to come out ' because of how the numbers work out , a well - known , elegant ` renormalization ' argument , and a more recent argument that is likely to be useful in other contexts .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present two results from probabilistic combinatorics",
    "; with the exception of these results , the arguments to come will be self - contained . in section  [ sec_dual ]",
    "we discuss the ` self - duality ' of @xmath0 .",
    "harris theorem will be proved in section  [ sec_h ] , the key application of the friedgut - kalai result will be given in section  [ sec_s ] , and three ways of deducing kesten s theorem in section  [ sec_k ] .",
    "in the last section we briefly discuss possible extensions .",
    "the first result we shall need is a very simple but fundamental lemma due to harris  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 be a fixed ground set with @xmath38 elements , and let @xmath39 be a random subset of @xmath37 obtained by selecting each @xmath40 independently with probability @xmath8 . for a family @xmath41 of subsets of @xmath37 , let @xmath42 be the probability that @xmath43 . in this context , @xmath44 is _ increasing _ if @xmath45 and @xmath46 imply @xmath47 .",
    "for example , @xmath37 might be a finite set of edges of @xmath0 , and @xmath39 the subset of @xmath37 consisting of the open edges .",
    "then an event is increasing if it is preserved when the states of one or more edges are changed from closed to open .",
    "[ l_harris ] if @xmath44 , @xmath48 are increasing , then for any @xmath8 we have @xmath49    in other words , increasing events are positively correlated .",
    "once one thinks of the statement , the proof turns out to be very simple , using induction on @xmath38 . taking complements ,",
    "lemma  [ l_harris ] also applies to two _ decreasing _ events , defined in the obvious way ; similarly , an increasing event and a decreasing one are negatively correlated .",
    "the extension to infinite product spaces is immediate ; we shall not need it here .",
    "harris discovered this lemma precisely in the context of percolation , although it is perhaps one of the most basic results of combinatorial probability . in the latter context",
    "harris lemma was rediscovered by kleitman  @xcite ; a series of important generalizations then followed , culminating in the very general ` four - functions theorem ' of ahlswede and daykin  @xcite .",
    "the second result we shall need is a sharp - threshold theorem of friedgut and kalai  @xcite , which is itself a simple consequence of a result of kahn , kalai and linial  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) concerning the influences of coordinates in a product space .    with the same set - up as above",
    ", @xmath41 is _ symmetric _ if there is a permutation group acting transitively on @xmath37 whose action on @xmath50 preserves @xmath44 . in our notation ,",
    "the result of friedgut and kalai we shall need is as follows .",
    "[ th_sharp ] there is an absolute constant @xmath51 such that if @xmath52 , @xmath41 is symmetric and increasing , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , then @xmath55 whenever @xmath56    having collected the basic results above for future reference , we are ready to start our simple proof that @xmath57 .",
    "throughout this paper we shall work with ` open crossings of rectangles ' , a standard concept of planar percolation .",
    "we shall identify a rectangle @xmath58\\times [ c , d]$ ] , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are integers , with an induced subgraph of @xmath0 .",
    "this subgraph includes all vertices and edges in the interior and boundary of @xmath61 .",

    "_ @xmath64 by @xmath65 rectangle_.    we write @xmath66 for the event that there is a",
    "_ horizontal open crossing _ of @xmath61 , i.e. , a path from the left side of @xmath61 to the right side consisting entirely of open edges of @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath67 for the event that there is a vertical open crossing of @xmath61 . note that for disjoint rectangles @xmath61 and @xmath68 ( a rectangle includes its boundary ) each of the events @xmath66 , @xmath67 is independent of each of the events @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the _ dual _ @xmath71 of the lattice @xmath72 is the usual planar dual of @xmath0 considered as a graph drawn in the plane : there is a vertex @xmath73 corresponding to each face of @xmath0 , i.e. , to each square @xmath74\\times [ y , y+1]$ ] , @xmath75 .",
    "it is customary to take @xmath76 .",
    "there is one edge @xmath77 of @xmath71 corresponding to each edge @xmath78 of @xmath79 ; this edge joins the two vertices of @xmath71 corresponding to the faces of @xmath79 in whose boundary @xmath78 lies .",
    "of course , @xmath71 may be defined analogously for any plane graph . when @xmath72 , then @xmath80 is isomorphic to @xmath79 , as shown below .",
    "@xmath81    the _ horizontal dual _ , or simply the _ dual _ , of a rectangle @xmath58\\times[c , d]$ ] is the rectangle @xmath82\\times [ c-1/2,d+1/2]$ ] in @xmath71 . defining an edge @xmath77 of @xmath71 to be open",
    "if and only if @xmath78 is closed , let @xmath83 be the event that there is a vertical crossing of @xmath84 by open edges of @xmath71 .",
    "the next lemma is key to the analysis of bond percolation in @xmath0 .",
    "often , it is stated as ` obvious ' and no formal proof is given . while the result is indeed obvious",
    ", it is not entirely trivial to prove .",
    "however , a short proof is possible , and , as it happens , needs no topology . for a topological proof of a related result",
    "see kesten  @xcite .",

    "the open edges of @xmath61 form a graph @xmath90 , and those of @xmath84 form a graph @xmath91 .",
    "our task is to show that either @xmath90 contains a left - right path , i.e. , a path from a vertex @xmath92 to a vertex @xmath93 , or else @xmath91 contains a top - bottom path , but not both . in proving this assertion",

    "note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are plane graphs with every edge a straight - line segment of length 4 .",
    "we shall construct a third graph , @xmath96 , which is in the ` middle ' , between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "orient every edge of @xmath96 so that @xmath90 is on the right and @xmath91 is on the left .",
    "then every vertex of @xmath96 has one edge coming in and one going out , apart from exactly four vertices of degree one , @xmath100 and @xmath11 , say , as in figure  [ fig_oneway ] .",

    "that @xmath66 and @xmath83 can not both hold is immediate from the jordan curve theorem ; however , only the easy part of this theorem is needed . indeed ,",

    "similarly , if @xmath102 ends at @xmath103 there is no left - right path in @xmath90 , completing the proof .    as the edges of @xmath71 are open independently with probability @xmath105 , lemma  [ l_oneway ] has the following immediate corollary concerning rectangles in the original lattice @xmath72 .",

    "the value of @xmath270 is important .",

    "lemma  [ l_1dep ] is an immediate consequence of the very general main result of  @xcite but , in the form above , is trivial from first principles . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath272 is finite , then it is surrounded by an open cycle in the dual lattice @xmath71 .",
