    "the star forming region m17 is notable for its asymmetry in terms of its appearance in different wavelength regimes .",
    "optically , it is visible as a nebula with a prominent northern bar marking the location of an ionization front , which suffers only a low level of optical extinction ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "radio maps have long revealed the presence of the southern bar , part of the m17-sw region , which has no obvious optical counterpart , and is thus understood to suffer a much higher level of extinction along our line of sight ( los ) . also noteworthy",
    "is the high - extinction patch situated in front of a number of o - type stellar members belonging to the ionizing cluster ngc 6618 , which from our direction can be found between the two ionization bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given that the southern bar includes an ionization front and a pdr that are both obscured in optical wavelength , it is best studied in the ir and radio regimes .",
    "previous ir and radio studies of m17-sw have described it as almost edge - on pdr @xcite , or as a bowl carved into the molecular cloud @xcite , and have concluded that it is comprised of a clumpy medium @xcite .    for this study we obtained _ spitzer _ spectroscopy of rotational emission lines of h@xmath0 toward m17-sw in order to model the data with our pdr code . specifically , we performed model mapping of the gas density over the field of view , and inferred the los configuration of the pdr layer ( see * ? ? ?",
    "owing to the presence of extinction obscuring the interface between the region and the molecular cloud , we also included @xmath3 in model mapping as means of dereddening the h@xmath0 line intensities .",
    "we shall present our results as a function of the radial distance from cen 1 , the primary o4 member of ngc 6618 .",
    "our _ spitzer _ observations of m17-sw belong to programs p03697 ( sh and lh data ) and p30295 ( sl data ) . data acquisitions for p03697 were executed on three dates between 2004 oct 02 and 2005 apr 23 , and those for p30295 on the two dates 2007 sep 30 and oct 12 .",
    "the target area was covered by multiple aors : 11 for sh , and 4 each for lh and sl data , see table 1 .",
    "following re - gridding onto the lh pixel frame , the area available for full analysis based on five emission lines includes 480 lh pixels .",
    "each lh pixel is 446 wide , corresponding to 8900 au , or 0.043 pc at a distance of 2.0 kpc ( @xmath4 precision , see * ? ? ?",
    "we employed version 1.7 of cubism @xcite for the reduction of observations and the construction of data cubes therefrom , assuring a match with the _ spitzer _ science center pipeline version s18.7.0 .",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the proper celestial location and orientation of the area of intersection of all modules over an 8 @xmath5 image from _ spitzer_/irac .",
    "four pure - rotational emission lines of h@xmath0 were detected and mapped toward the target : s(1 ) and s(2 ) at 17.03 and 12.28 @xmath5 , respectively , from the sh module , and s(3 ) and s(5 )    at 9.66 and 6.91 @xmath5 , respectively , from orders 1 and 2 , respectively , of the sl module . owing to lack of reliable signal from s(0 ) at 28.22 @xmath5 ,",
    "albeit located within the wavelength interval of coverage of the lh module , our pdr modeling did not include the s(0 ) line .",
    "emission line maps were constructed by using in - house idl procedures to fit line profiles and to derive integrated line intensities that included continuum removal following its fitting by a low - order polynomial .",
    "the presence in these spectra of emission lines of ionized atomic species appreciably stronger than the emission lines from h@xmath0 necessitated an additional step of deblending s(5 ) and [ ] at 6.98 @xmath5 .",
    "such a challenge did not arise in the analysis of similar data toward ngc 2023-south , where lines of ionized species were either weak or undetectable @xcite .",
    "we note that the spectral co - presence of region and pdr emission lines shows that both regions are sampled along the los toward m17-sw , thus indicating that their configuration can not be strictly edge - on .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for zodiacal background emission owing to the bright nature of this target and the insensitivity of continuum - subtracted emission lines to such uniform contribution .",
    "based on the discussion in @xcite , data from the lh and sh modules were corrected by a factor of 0.84 in order to obtain calibration match with the sl module flux values .    in order to compare emission data with pdr models ,",
    "line intensities were converted to column density via @xmath6 @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 stand for the column density , emission intensity , einstein a - coefficient , and transition energy for each rotational upper level @xmath10 . this conversion is linear owing to insignificant self - absorption of these quadrupole transitions .",
    "the four right panels of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] show the radial variation of h@xmath0 emission lines with distance from cen 1 , following data averaging along the orthogonal direction .",
    "both intensity and column density scales are provided .",
    "the two primary pdr parameters are @xmath11 , the total hydrogen number density , and @xmath12 , the ratio of the incident 613.6 ev far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux over the habing flux of @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we employed the @xcite pdr code to generate a ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) grid of 950 normal models , where ` normal ' means that the incident radiation field is normal to the pdr surface ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "model output consists of @xmath16(h@xmath0 ) values following an integration along the normal as well , with grid step being 0.1 dex .",
    "model mapping was performed with the parameter @xmath12 constrained to predicted values .",
    "this was motivated by the availability of lists of o - type stars residing in and around ngc 6618 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as by the knowledge of precise ( albeit projected ) linear distances between each star and each mapped data pixel .",
    "thus @xmath12 was obtained by summing the fuv flux of 19 o - type stars listed in @xcite and using @xmath17 where the superscript ` pr ' may stand for ` predicted ' or ` projected , ' @xmath18 is the distance to m17-sw in kpc , @xmath19 is the fuv luminosity of stellar radiator @xmath20 in solar units @xcite , and @xmath21 is the angular separation between star @xmath20 and any map pixel in seconds of arc .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows that the values of @xmath22 range over @xmath23(18)@xmath24 .",
    "we perform a search for the smallest root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) of the differences in dex between modeled and observed @xmath16 values , thus yielding values for the ratio @xmath25 data / model .",
    "this ratio may be decomposed into two @xmath26 and two @xmath27 factors , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the number of pdrs along the los and here assumed to be 1 , @xmath30 accounts for limb brightening owing to inclination angle @xmath31 , @xmath32 accounts for the angle of incidence of the radiation field on the pdr , and @xmath33 is the beam area filling factor , also assumed to be 1 .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the @xmath34 pc sizes of both observationally - derived c@xmath35o clumps toward m17-sw @xcite and pdr - modelled clumps with @xmath36 @xmath2 @xcite , as well as with the @xmath37 pc ( at @xmath38 kpc ) beam widths of the sh and sl modules of _ spitzer_-irs .",
    "owing to the dependence of the two angular factors , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , on the local orientation of the cloud surface @xcite , we shall employ them to infer clues about the los variations of the pdr over the field of view , see @xmath415 .",
    "it is customary to de - redden the observed @xmath42 values by the known or assumed value of extinction , @xmath3 , prior to comparing @xmath3-corrected @xmath16 values with model output .",
    "here we employ the @xcite reddening law .",
    "our initial pdr mapping runs employed a global ( or spatially - invariant ) correction by @xmath43 mag , approximating the average value toward the central members of ngc 6618 @xcite .",
    "however , some of the ob stars in the m17 region appear to show appreciably higher extinction values , with @xmath44 mag @xcite .",
    "follow - up modeling with @xmath45 mag returned fits with rmsd values smaller by factors of 1.31.5 , whereas further reductions by factors of 1.31.8 were achieved by fits employing a global @xmath46 mag . inevitably , we included @xmath3 as a free parameter that was allowed to    vary over the entire field of view .",
    "superficially , both @xmath47 and @xmath3 corrections affect the ratios of data to model intensities . however , whereas the former applies the same factor to all emission lines , the latter has different values for different emission lines .",
    "thus @xmath3 affects the ratios between emission lines from different @xmath10 levels , unlike @xmath47 .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] present our pdr model mapping results , with a mean rmsd of 0.029 , or @xmath237% .",
    "values of @xmath11 are found to be mostly between ( 2.02.5 ) @xmath48 @xmath2 , or @xmath49 times higher than the density modeled for the southern ridge ( sr ) in ngc 2023 @xcite .",
    "such values are consistent with h@xmath0 emission production in high - density clumps immersed in an interclump gas of density lower by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the ( unshown ) fixed parameter @xmath12 follows the values of @xmath22 from eq . 1 by design .",
    "the next panel presents model output for @xmath3 , which to our knowledge is the first attempt to derive extinction values from pdr modeling .",
    "the mean of visual extinction preferred by the models is 30 mag , about 24 times as high as the initially presumed values of 8 and 15 mag .",
    "values of @xmath3 , which range over 1547 mag , are clearly increasing away from ngc 6618 with a gradient of 21 @xmath50 2 mag pc@xmath14 .",
    "such a positive gradient is not unexpected : the structure of m17-sw includes a sequence of region , a pdr , and a dense molecular cloud along the same radial direction .",
    "our high values of modeled @xmath3 are in very good agreement with other indicators of extinction over the m17-sw field , i.e , away from the central region of ngc 6618 .",
    "for example , determinations based on reddening toward individual m17-sw stellar sources have presented the following values : @xmath51 mag for the optically thickest regions , as well as @xmath52 mag for the molecular cloud core based on the @xmath53-band luminosity function @xcite ; a range of @xmath54 mag for 55 stars within 0.7 pc of the kw object , as well as @xmath3 of 24 and 30 mag toward the two components of the kw object itself @xcite ; and @xmath55 mag for a large number of sources along the reddening vector @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even higher extinction estimates have been derived from far - ir and mm - wave observations that dissect the entire molecular cloud surrounding our field of view toward m17-sw .",
    "for example , @xcite found @xmath56 mag through the core of the molecular cloud ; @xcite estimated @xmath57 mag at the peak of @xmath58co emission ; @xcite found @xmath59 mag based on @xmath58co data ; and finally , @xcite decomposed cloud b into individual clumps with inferred @xmath60(h@xmath61@xmath62 @xmath7 for clumps b25 , b27 , b29 , b32 , and b34 , which are the ones that are either partially or fully overlapped by our _ spitzer _ field of view .",
    "focusing on b27 and b29 , the two @xmath58co clumps wholly enclosed inside our field , and employing the relationship @xmath63(h@xmath64 mag , values of @xmath3 = 21 and 29 mag can be inferred through these two clumps in cloud b. we consider such a consistent picture as a confirmation that pdr modeling may be employed for reliable mapping of @xmath3 values toward h@xmath0 emission obscured by dust .",
    "although we find here very good agreement between pdr - modeled @xmath3 values and values that have been derived by other means , it is important to cross - check our method toward another well - studied pdr , owing to the novelty involved .",
    "ngc 2023 is such a pdr , toward which a previously successful pdr modeling has been achieved with a fixed value of @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we performed the parameterized-@xmath3 test successfully , resulting in model fits similar to those previously obtained , as well as in @xmath3 output consistent with results from other studies . whereas our previous modeling employed a fixed value of @xmath65 mag , or equivalently , @xmath66 mag , the new test returns a field - wide median of @xmath43 mag .",
    "our pdr modeling is again indicating a positive radial gradient of extinction across the field , starting with much lower values of @xmath3 in the region between the sr and the exciting star , hd 37903 , and reaching @xmath67 mag on the other side of the sr , or deeper into the dense molecular cloud . in this case , as is the case with m17-sw , the larger pdr - modeled @xmath3 values are consistent with previous studies .",
    "@xcite concluded that over small scales , the extinction toward stars in ngc 2023 varies over 010 mag .",
    "furthermore , the total extinction through the molecular cloud is expected to be @xmath6825 mag @xcite . over the sr ,",
    "the range of @xmath3 values is @xmath69 mag , where the inferred semi - amplitude of the range is comparable to the level of uncertainty in the visual extinction determinations toward heavily obscured targets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for m17-sw",
    "we find a dispersion of @xmath70 mag along the fitted gradient .",
    "a visually stunning depiction of the radially increasing @xmath3 field is provided in the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , which is based on figure 1 from @xcite .",
    "our basic assumption is that the observed h@xmath0 emission originates on a cloud surface facing away from our direction and basking in the fuv starshine of ngc 6618 .",
    "we thus view the obscured back side of the pdr surface through the bulk of cloud b , as measured by our modeled @xmath3 extinction values along the los , see right panel of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "any or high-@xmath10 co line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) would also be observed from the far side of the intervening molecular cloud and its interpretation should account for the face - on geometry and intervening cold gas layer .",
    "the last panel of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] showed that @xmath71 , which means that @xmath72 under the assumption of @xmath73 , and therefore a shallow grazing angle for the fuv influx from ngc 6618 .",
    "we further assume that the cos(@xmath74)/cos(@xmath31 ) curve is defined by three continuous segments of the pdr surface and not by local variations over pixel - sized scales .",
    "each construction of    a pdr surface begins at any arbitrarily chosen location along the los , and proceeds by forcing neighboring segments to be smoothly connected in order to avoid the introduction of fuv shadowing between segments .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] presents four examples of pdr surfaces that share the same curve of @xmath47 values .",
    "the first three surfaces , shown in the left panel , belong to our basic assumption that the pdr is viewed from its back side .",
    "each derived concave surface is consistent with the general 3-d configuration of a bowl - shaped interface originally suggested by @xcite , see also figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "the right panel show an alternate configuration in which the pdr is viewed from its front side and is physically separated from the layer of foreground extinction . although the cos(@xmath74)/cos(@xmath31 ) curve fixes the relative curvature of the surface , and thus provides a ` 3-d view ' of the pdr layer along the los , both the absolute location along the los and the state of reflection about the abscissa are , unfortunately , degenerate .",
    "future studies could incorporate additional clues for a more robust characterization of the location and the reflection of the pdr surface .",
    "for example , our initial tests involving a freely variable @xmath12 show that its values start to drop significantly below @xmath22 values half way along the mapped radial distance from ngc 6618 .",
    "such a behavior may indicate that the line of sight is probing a more extreme case of geometry than derived here . among the pdr surfaces depicted in figure  [ fig :",
    "fig4 ] , only ` a ' , and therefore ` @xmath75a ' , affect @xmath12 values in a similar fashion , owing to their increasing deviation from the plane of projection . on the other hand , the role of pixel - to - pixel variations , such as those seen in modeling output",
    ", remains to be evaluated in terms of orientation and mutual shadowing among individual clumps .",
    "_ spitzer_-irs spectra were obtained and employed in our quest to measure the intensity of h@xmath0 emission lines toward the pdr m17-sw .",
