    "the ultimate fate is therefore extinction , no matter how dense the neutron population is at the initial time . for the system with population control ,",
    "spatial fluctuations can be tamed by acting on the total number of neutrons that are present in the reactor at equilibrium : when the ratio of the specific square separation distance between neutrons corresponding to an ideal uniform spatial distribution and the neutron migration area ( i.e. , the typical square distance travelled by a particle by diffusion in the time span of a generation ) is small , diffusion dominates over births and deaths , and the spatial clustering is quenched .",
    "this physically means that imposing a global feedback on the whole neutron population has a stabilizing effect also at the local scale of the spatial fluctuations .",
    "the proposed reactor model retains the essential statistical aspects of actual systems , and as such it offers valuable insight on the behaviour of the spatial correlations . in our derivation , we have nonetheless introduced a number of simplifying hypotheses : for instance , we have assumed that the energy dependence of the physical parameters involved in neutron transport ( such as the probability of fission and absorption , or the reaction rate ) could be neglected ; furthermore , we have modelled the boundaries of the reactor as reflecting , although a more realistic description would imply the possibility of particles leaking from the external surface . finally , the effects of control rods in nuclear reactors are clearly localized in space , whereas in this work we have represented population control as a spatially homogeneous mechanism .",

    "<S> the neutron population in a prototype model of nuclear reactor can be described in terms of a collection of particles confined in a box and undergoing three key random mechanisms : diffusion , reproduction due to fissions , and death due to absorption events . when the reactor is operated at the critical point , and fissions are exactly compensated by absorptions , the whole neutron population might in principle go to extinction because of the wild fluctuations induced by births and deaths . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , which has been named critical catastrophe , is nonetheless never observed in practice : feedback mechanisms acting on the total population , such as human intervention , have a stabilizing effect . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the critical catastrophe by investigating the spatial behaviour of the fluctuations in a confined geometry . </S>",
    "<S> when the system is free to evolve , the neutrons may display a wild patchiness ( clustering ) . on the contrary , imposing a population control on the total population acts also against the local fluctuations , and may thus inhibit the spatial clustering . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of population control in quenching spatial fluctuations will be shown to depend on the competition between the mixing time of the neutrons ( i.e. , the average time taken for a particle to explore the finite viable space ) and the extinction time .    </S>",
