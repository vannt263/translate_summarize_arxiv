    "the @xmath1 is a @xmath16 resonance near 3872 mev discovered in 2003 by the belle collaboration @xcite and subsequently observed by the cdf , babar , and d0 collaborations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the discovery decay mode @xmath11 , the @xmath4 has been observed to decay into @xmath17 , @xmath12 , @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the decay into @xmath17 implies that the @xmath4 is even under charge conjugation .",
    "an analysis by the belle collaboration of the decays of @xmath4 into @xmath11 strongly favors the quantum numbers @xmath0 , but does not exclude @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "the tiny phase space available for the decay into @xmath13 rules out @xmath19 , leaving @xmath10 as the only option .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath1 is that its mass @xmath20 is extremely close to the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "the pdg value for @xmath20 comes from combining measurements of @xmath4 in the @xmath11 decay mode @xcite . after taking into account a recent precision measurement of the @xmath21 mass by the cleo collaboration @xcite , the difference between the pdg value for @xmath20 and the @xmath2 threshold is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the masses of @xmath25 and @xmath21 . the negative central value in eq .",
    "( [ mx - cleo ] ) is compatible with the @xmath4 being a bound state of the charm mesons .",
    "the measured mass of the near - threshold enhancement in @xmath13 is about 4 mev above the @xmath2 threshold @xcite .",
    "this value is compatible with @xmath4 being a virtual state of charm mesons .",
    "it differs from the mass in eq .",
    "( [ mx - cleo ] ) by more than two standard deviations , which raises the question of whether the decays into @xmath11 and @xmath13 are coming from the same resonance .",
    "the proximity of the mass of the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 threshold has motivated its identification as a weakly - bound molecule whose constituents are a superposition of the charm meson pairs @xmath2 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the establishment of the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 as @xmath10 makes this conclusion almost unavoidable .",
    "the reason is that these quantum numbers allow s - wave couplings of the @xmath4 to @xmath2 and @xmath26 .",
    "nonrelativistic quantum mechanics implies that a resonance in an s - wave channel near a 2-particle threshold has special universal features @xcite . because of the small energy gap between the resonance and the 2-particle threshold , there is a strong coupling between the resonance and the two particles",
    "this strong coupling generates dynamically a large length scale that can be identified with the absolute value of the s - wave scattering length @xmath27 of the two particles .",
    "independent of the original mechanism for the resonance , the strong coupling transforms the resonance into a bound state just below the two - particle threshold if @xmath28 or into a virtual state just above the two - particle threshold if @xmath29 . if @xmath28 , the bound state has a molecular structure , with the particles having a large mean separation of order @xmath27 .    to see that the universal features of an s - wave threshold resonance are relevant to the @xmath1 ,",
    "we need only note that its binding energy is small compared to the natural energy scale associated with pion exchange @xcite : @xmath30 mev , where @xmath31 is the reduced mass of the two constituents .",
    "the universal features of the @xmath1 were first exploited by voloshin to describe its decays into @xmath13 and @xmath32 , which can proceed through decay of the constituent @xmath25 or @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "universality has also been applied to the production process @xmath34 @xcite , to the line shapes of the @xmath4 @xcite , and to decays of @xmath4 into @xmath35 and pions @xcite .",
    "these applications rely on factorization formulas that separate the length scale @xmath27 from all the shorter distance scales of qcd @xcite .",
    "the factorization formulas can be derived using the operator product expansion for a low - energy effective field theory @xcite .",
    "other interpretations of the @xmath1 besides a charm meson molecule or a charm meson virtual state have been proposed , including a p - wave charmonium state or a tetraquark state .",
    "( for a review , see ref .  @xcite . ) if the charmonium or tetraquark models were extended to include the coupling of the @xmath4 to @xmath2 and @xmath26 scattering states , the universal features of an s - wave threshold resonance imply that the tuning of the binding energy to the threshold region would transform the state into a charm meson molecule or a virtual state of charm mesons .",
    "any model of the @xmath1 that does not take into account its strong coupling to charm meson scattering states should not be taken seriously .",
    "given that the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 are @xmath10 , the measured mass @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ mx - cleo ] ) implies unambiguously that @xmath4 must be either a charm meson molecule or a virtual state of charm mesons .",
    "the remaining challenge is to discriminate between these two possibilities .",
    "if the @xmath4 was sufficiently narrow , there would be clear qualitative differences in its line shapes between these two possibilities .",
    "we first consider the @xmath13 decay mode , which has a contribution from the decay of a constituent @xmath25 .",
    "if the @xmath4 was a charm meson molecule , its line shape in @xmath13 would consist of a breit - wigner resonance below the @xmath2 threshold and a threshold enhancement above the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "if the @xmath4 was a virtual state , there would only be the threshold enhancement above the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "we next consider decay modes that have no contributions from the decay of a constituent @xmath25 , such as @xmath11 .",
    "if the @xmath4 was a charm meson molecule , its line shape in such a decay mode would be a breit - wigner resonance below the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "if the @xmath4 was a virtual state , there would only be a cusp at the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "the possibility of interpreting the @xmath36 as a cusp at the @xmath2 threshold has been suggested by bugg @xcite .",
    "increasing the width of the @xmath4 provides additional smearing of the line shapes .",
    "this makes the qualitative difference between the line shapes of a charm meson molecule and a virtual state less dramatic . to discriminate between these two possibilities",
    "therefore requires a quantitative analysis .",
    "there have been two recent analyses of data on @xmath37 that shed light on the issue of whether the @xmath4 is a bound state or a virtual state .",
    "hanhart et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data on @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the belle and babar collaborations using a model for the scattering amplitude in the @xmath40 channel that is a generalization of the flatt parametrization for a near - threshold resonance .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath13 threshold enhancement observed by the belle and babar collaborations is compatible with the @xmath1 only if the @xmath4 is a virtual state .",
    "one flaw in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is that it did not take into account the width of the constituent @xmath25 .",
    "they also assumed incorrectly that a bound state below the @xmath2 threshold would not decay into @xmath13 .    in ref .",

    "an analysis of the data on @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the belle collaboration indicated that the data preferred the @xmath1 to be a bound state but a virtual state was not excluded .",
