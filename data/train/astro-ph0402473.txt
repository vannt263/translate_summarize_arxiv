    "sn1961v in the outskirts of the sc galaxy ngc1058 ( distance = 9.3 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the prototype of zwicky s type  v supernovae ( sne ) , which are now classified as type ii peculiar sne .",
    "sn1961v was unusual in many respects @xcite .",
    "first , sn1961v is one of the very few sne whose progenitors are known .",
    "the progenitor of sn1961v was visible as an 18 mag star from 1937 to 1960 @xcite .",
    "second , the optical light curve of sn1961v was more complex and much broader than any other sn ever observed .",
    "it peaked at @xmath312 mag in late 1961 , remained visible for several years , and faded to 21.7 mag in 1970 @xcite .",
    "third , the initial expansion velocity of sn1961v , 2,0003,000 km s@xmath2 , was much lower than the typical expansion velocity of 15,00020,000 km s@xmath2 for most sne @xcite",
    ".    these peculiar properties of sn1961v have raised skepticism concerning its nature as a sn .",
    "based on the extended optical light curve and the anomalously low expansion velocity , @xcite suggested that sn1961v was a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) similar to @xmath1  car , and its  sn explosion \" was actually a super - outburst . @xcite obtained _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "wfc1 images of sn1961v and identified a red star with @xmath4 = 24.55 , their object 6 , as a candidate for the lbv survivor . using archival _",
    "wfpc2 images , @xcite suggested a fainter and redder star as an alternative candidate for the lbv survivor and called it object 11 as an extension of the @xcite object list .",
    "the lbv hypothesis can not explain , however , the nonthermal radio spectral index of sn1961v , @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the radio emission from @xmath1 car and its ejecta is thermal and optically thick , as it shows a positive spectral index and a complete lack of polarization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sn  1961v is more than 1,000 times more luminous than @xmath1 car at 20-cm wavelength @xcite and its radio light curve is similar to those of radio sne @xcite .",
    "existent images of sn1961v show a complex environment . narrow - band , emission - line images reveal two regions within 3@xmath7 to the north of sn1961v @xcite , while broad - band continuum _ hst _",
    "wfc1 images show massive stars in and around the regions and in the vicinity of sn1961v @xcite .",
    "sn1961v is clearly associated with a star - forming environment , where sne are expected to occur .",
    "indeed , radio observations @xcite show a nonthermal source at the south edge of the eastern region , coincident to within 1@xmath7 of the optical position of sn1961v , and a fainter nonthermal radio source in the western region , corresponding to an unrelated supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "to determine the nature of sn1961v , it is crucial to recover the optical counterpart of sn1961v with a high degree of certainty , and to determine spectroscopically whether it is a surviving lbv or a sn turning into a snr .",
    "thus , we have obtained _ hst _ imaging and spectroscopic observations of sn1961v .",
    "we have also obtained high - resolution radio observations to determine the size of the radio source at sn1961v . this paper reports these observations of sn1961v and our analysis of its nature .",
    "sn1961v was observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on 2002 october 23 .",
    "medium - resolution optical spectra were obtained with the g430 m and g750 m gratings tilted to observe the spectral ranges centered at 4961    and 6581   , respectively .",
    "the wavelength coverage and spectral resolution of the resulting spectrograms are 4800 - 5125    and @xmath30.8   for the g430 m granting , and 62506900    and @xmath31.3   for the g750 m grating .",
    "the 52@xmath82  slit was used in order to obtain `` slitless '' spectra of multiple sources simultaneously .",
    "the long dimension of the slit was oriented along a position angle of 1396 to optimize the projected separations among the candidates of sn1961v s optical counterpart , minimizing the confusion from overlapping spectra .",
    "the target position was acquired by peaking up on a nearby star and then offsetting to the location of sn1961v .",
    "spectrograms were then obtained using cr - split@xmath94 for a total exposure time of 4,377 and 3,902 s for the g750 m and g430 m gratings , respectively . in between the spectroscopic observations , a deep image of the field with the 50ccd aperture and no filter",
    "was obtained for comparison with the spectroscopic observations .",
    "this imaging observation also used a cr - split@xmath94 and had a total integration time of 1,800 s.    the raw observations were reduced using the stsdas v3.0 and calstis v2.3 utilities within iraf . for this reduction",
    "the best reference files were obtained from the multimission archive at space telescope .",
    "the sources in the field are too faint for the observations to be dithered to aid in the rejection of hot / warm pixels in the stis / ccd images / spectra ; therefore , the standard reduction pipeline was used with some attempt made to construct a better dark frame than was available .",
    "the raw dark frames obtained as part of the stis calibration programs 9605 and 9612 , which occurred closest in time to our stis observations , were uploaded and combined .",
    "we found that even restricting the darks used to those from the five days bracketing our observations did not improve our image quality .",
    "we also investigated making changes to the standard pipeline processing where the dark frame was scaled to account for the difference in exposure time and ccd housing temperature .",
    "we found that a slight improvement to the image quality could be made by reducing the pipeline s default scaling of the darks by 10% for our imaging data and 2% for our spectroscopic data .",
    "the effect of these changes is to minimize the excursions of improperly subtracted hot pixels from the median value in the frame .",
    "an astrometric solution in the icrs 2000.0 frame for the stis / ccd image of the region around sn1961v was obtained by first finding an astrometric solution for a wfpc2 image taken with the f606w filter as part of program 5446 .",
    "this astrometric solution for the wfpc2 image is based on the positions of 7 stars with low proper motions from the usno b1.0 catalog and has an accuracy of better than 02 based on the residuals of the least squares fit to the stellar positions .",
    "we then used 19 point sources that appear in both the wfpc2 and stis images to obtain a bootstrapped astrometric solution for the stis image .",
    "the accuracy of the astrometry for the stis image is estimated to be @xmath3025 based on the rms of the residuals from the least squares fit bootstrap solution added in quadrature to the uncertainty for the astrometric solution for the wfpc2 image .",
    "we have made high - resolution radio observations of sn  1961v using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the observations were made at 18  cm on 1999 september 14 .",
    "3c286 and 3c48 were used for flux calibration and j0253 + 3835 was used for phase calibration @xcite .",
    "sn  1961v is a weak source for the vlba @xcite , so the phased very large array ( vla ) in its a - configuration , the longest baseline mode , was included to improve the sensitivity .",
    "the 27 vla antennae were phased and sampled every 10 seconds , and this sampling rate was used for the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) data set .",
    "the data set was averaged in frequency to a total of 8 intermediate frequencies ( if s ) .",
    "we iteratively self - calibrated the vlba observations of j0253 + 3835 for a single if to produce a common amplitude scale , and this model was applied to the other if s to produce a vlba phase solution . the vlba and vla",
    "observations of j0253 + 3835 were then combined and self - calibrated further to achieve the best possible vlbi phase solutions . for a consistency check of our phase solution , embedded scans of a secondary calibrator , j0230 + 4032 , were obtained throughout the course of the observations of sn1961v .",
    "the vlbi phase solution was applied to the observations and the resulting visibilities were fourier transformed to obtain an image of sn1961v .",
    "the synthesized beam size for this vlbi image was 11.5 mas @xmath8 7.56 mas , and the rms noise in the map was 0.030 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "no compact or diffuse sources were detected with @xmath10 confidence within 100 mas of the radio position of sn1961v , at which the simultaneous vla observations detected @xmath11 mjy beam@xmath2 for a synthesized beam of 120 @xmath8 101 @xcite . to reconcile the vla detection and vlbi non - detection ,",
    "the radio emission must be distributed over an area greater than the vlbi synthesized beam , i.e. , @xmath12 7.56 mas .",
    "the broad - band stis image in figure 1 represents the deepest high - resolution image of sn1961v and its surroundings ever obtained .",
    "in addition to the eleven bright stellar objects identified by @xcite and @xcite , many fainter stars are also detected .",
    "these eleven bright objects , marked in figure 1c , are mostly supergiants with @xmath13 24 to 25.5 . to illustrate the position of sn1961v , radio contours extracted from the @xcite 18 cm vla map are plotted over the stis image in figure 1d .",
    "the eastern radio source corresponds to sn1961v , and our new astrometric calibration (  2.1 ) now places object 7 the closest to sn1961v .",
    "three nebular arcs are visible and form an apparent supershell structure about @xmath14 ( or 240 pc @xmath8 135 pc ) in size . encompassed within the supershell are sn1961v and objects 6 , 7 , 9 , and 11 , while projected along the supershell rim are objects 5 , 8 , and 10 .    to date",
    ", the best narrow - band images of sn1961v are still those obtained by @xcite using the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope . his red continuum image had a limiting magnitude of @xmath3 21 mag , so it did not detect any of the stars in the vicinity of sn1961v shown in our stis image .",
    "two regions are detected in the [ ] image , but they appear better resolved in the h@xmath0 + [ ] -emission knots in the southern extension are coincident with object 7 inside the supershell and object 5 along the south rim of the supershell , respectively . in the western region , the eastern emission patch is coincident with the bright object 10 , but the western emission patch has no detectable stellar counterparts in our stis image .",
    "the image of object 10 is elongated and somewhat resolved , indicating that it consists of multiple stars ; its location inside an region further indicates that it contains a group of massive stars .",
    "the stars in object 10 are probably at least a few myr old , as they are coincident with a radio snr identified by @xcite , the western radio source in figure  1d .    in summary ,",
    "the stis image illustrates that sn1961v is associated with a complex , extended star forming region .",
    "it is projected within the central cavity of a supershell , with bright regions distributed along the shell rim .",
    "the presence of both regions and snrs indicates that a mixture of stellar populations at different ages exist within @xmath3100 pc of sn1961v .",
    "the optical position of sn1961v was determined by @xcite to an accuracy better than 01 , and this position is coincident with a fading nonthermal radio source @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  1d , object 7 is the closest to sn1961v , the eastern radio source .",
    "our long - slit stis spectroscopic observations have been designed to detect line emission , as the stellar sources are faint and the detection of their continuum requires unrealistically long exposures . of all stellar sources in the slit ,",
    "only one is detected in h@xmath0 emission ( see fig .  2 ) . aligning the stis direct image with the h@xmath0 spectrogram",
    ", we find that the point source corresponds to object 7 .",
    "the wavelength scale in figure  2 is calibrated for the slit center ; as object 7 is offset by 046 from the slit center , a wavelength correction of @xmath155.1   should be applied . and a spatial scale of 005 pixel@xmath2 ;",
    "therefore , a 046 offset from the slit center corresponds to a wavelength offset of @xmath16 = 5.1  . ]",
    "the corrected wavelength of the h@xmath0 emission from object 7 corresponds to a heliocentric velocity of @xmath17 km  s@xmath2 , which is consistent with the systemic velocity of the regions near sn1961v measured by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 line profile of object 7 , shown in figure 3 , appears to have a narrow core and broad wings , which can be measured up to @xmath18550 km  s@xmath2 ( limited by the noise level of the spectrum ) .",
    "the absence of forbidden lines such as [ ] @xmath196300 and [ ] @xmath195007 indicates that the h@xmath0 emission is stellar as opposed to originating from a sn / snr transition object like sn1979c or sn1980k @xcite .",
    "our stis spectrograms also detected a patch of diffuse emission in the h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath204959 , 5007 lines .",
    "this emission originates from the northwest rim of the supershell and corresponds to the northern part of the western region identified by @xcite .",
    "the velocity of this diffuse emission can not be accurately determined , but is consistent with @xmath21 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "recent vla observations of sn1961v @xcite show that it is a nonthermal radio source with a spectral index of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and a time decay index of @xmath24 at @xmath320  cm ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the spectral and temporal properties of sn1961v are consistent with other decades - old radio sne , for example , sne 1970 g , 1957d , and 1950b @xcite .",
    "these properties are not consistent with radio observations of lbvs , which have an overall flat radio spectrum when convolved to the vla resolution limit of sn  1961v , for example , ag  car , he  3 - 519 , hr  car , wra  751 , p  cyg , and @xmath1  car @xcite .",
    "a more apt radio comparison may be made with sn1954j in ngc2403 ( 3.2 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has been established to be an outburst of the lbv `` variable 12 '' , misidentified as a sn @xcite .",
    "the region near sn1954j was observed with the vla at 20  cm about 31 yr following its outburst , but no source was detected with a @xmath26 limit of 0.35 mjy beam@xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand , the vla detection of sn1961v at 18  cm about 38 yr after the explosion indicates that it would been detected with a flux density of 0.98 mjy beam@xmath2 were it in ngc2403 . clearly , sn1961v is more than three times more luminous than sn1954j at 18 - 20  cm .",
    "our recent vlbi experiment (  2.2 ) allows us to make a more definitive radio analysis than previously possible with resolution - limited vla studies .",
    "the vlbi non - detection of sn1961v indicates that its radio emitting region is larger than the vlbi resolution element ; thus the minimum diameter of sn1961v is 7.56 mas , or 0.34 pc for a distance of 9.3 mpc . assuming that the nonthermal radio emission detected by the vla observations originates from synchrotron radiation associated with sn shocks @xcite , this minimum size implies an average expansion velocity in excess of 4,400 km s@xmath2 , between the time of the vlbi experiment and the reported sn explosion , i.e. , @xmath338 yr .",
    "this expansion velocity is much higher than the optical expansion velocity of 2,000 km s@xmath2 measured in 1961 november , toward the end of the broad maximum in the light curve .",
    "such a large discrepancy in expansion velocities determined at optical and radio wavelengths has been seen previously in sn1986j , another type ii peculiar sn .",
    "the optical expansion velocity of sn1986j measured in 1986 , several years after its possible explosion in 1982 - 1983 , was less than 1,000 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , vlbi observations of sn1986j in 1990 and 1999 suggest that its expansion velocity was 20,000 km  s@xmath2 at @xmath270.25 yr and 6,000 km  s@xmath2 at @xmath2715.9 yr @xcite , well in excess of the optical expansion velocity . in the case of sn1986j , its identification as a sn has been commonly accepted .      was the sn1961v event a sn explosion or a super - outburst of an lbv ?",
    "the strongest support for the sn hypothesis has been provided by radio observations .",
    "the nonthermal radio spectral index , high radio luminosity , and the temporal decline of radio luminosity are all consistent with the existence of a decades - old sn .",
    "furthermore , these radio properties are not like those of any known lbv : radio emission from lbvs are predominantly thermal in origin , and lbvs ( including sn1954j ) are much fainter than sn1961v .",
    "the size of sn1961v s emitting region may further constrain its nature .",
    "object 7 is unresolved in the _ hst _ stis images , placing an upper limit of 005 = 2.25 pc on its size .",
    "the vlbi non - detection places a lower limit of 7.6 mas = 0.34 pc on the diameter of the radio - emitting region .",
    "these sizes are significantly larger than the size of @xmath1 car s nebula in 1995 , 0.09 pc @xmath8 0.17 pc , @xmath3150 yr after it was ejected during `` the great eruption '' in 1837 - 1860 @xcite . whether sn1961v was a sn explosion or an lbv outburst , the ejected material expands and the expansion velocity can be estimated from the size and time lapse .",
    "the above lower and upper limits on size require that the expansion velocity is at least 4,000 km  s@xmath2 but at most 27,000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "such high expansion velocity is consistent with a sn explosion , but not an lbv outburst .",
    "the hypothesis that sn1961v was an lbv outburst can be verified only if the lbv survivor can be convincingly identified .",
    "our stis observations suggest that object 7 is the most likely candidate for the lbv survivor because it is the closest to the optical and radio position of sn1961v and is the only stellar object with the h@xmath0 emission line detected .",
    "however , object 7 is not as red as @xmath1 car after a super - outburst . using _ hst _",
    "wfc1 images taken in 1991 december , @xcite reported @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( errors @xmath31 0.2 mag ) for object 7 . using _",
    "wfpc2 @xmath32 images taken in 1994 september and @xmath33 and @xmath34 images taken in 2002 july , @xcite reported @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for object 7 with errors @xmath3 0.14 mag .",
    "these can be compared to the lbv variable 12 that was responsible for sn1954j : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( errors @xmath3 0.2 mag ) in 1999 february @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the color of object 7 , @xmath42 at about 41 yr after the light maximum , is not as red as the color of variable 12 , @xmath43 at about 45 yr after the outburst .",
    "because of the color difference , object 7 at 41 yr after is about 1 mag brighter in @xmath44 but 0.6 mag fainter in @xmath45 compared to variable 12 at 45 yr after the outburst",
    ".    we can also compare the h@xmath0 line profile of object 7 to that of @xmath1 car . at the distance of sn1961v",
    ", 9.3 mpc , @xmath1 car would not be resolved from its ejecta ; therefore , we have extracted an integrated spectrum of @xmath1 car and its surrounding ejecta nebula .",
    "car in the h@xmath0 and [ ] lines in 1996 january by chu et al .",
    "the spectral resolution , determined from the fwhm of the sky lines was @xmath3 12 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "parts of the data were published by @xcite . ] the ejecta nebula of @xmath1 car shows pronounced [ ] lines relative to the h@xmath0 line , but the integrated spectrum of the star and the ejecta nebula is dominated by the stellar h@xmath0 emission and the nebular [ ] lines become negligible .",
    "figure 3 shows that the h@xmath0 line profile of object 7 is remarkably similar to that of @xmath1 car .",
    "the lack of a [ ] counterpart to the h@xmath0 emission from object 7 indicates that the emitting material is dense and must be stellar , as is the case for lbvs or mass - losing stars in general .",
    "unfortunately , the previous observations of the h@xmath0 line of sn1961v made by @xcite in 1986 were of much lower spectral and spatial resolution , so that the h@xmath0 and [ ] lines were blended and heavily contaminated by bright region emission .",
    "it is impossible to determine whether the h@xmath0 line width evolved from 1986 to present .",
    "is object 7 an lbv ? while its h@xmath0 line profile resembles that of @xmath1 car , its color is not red .",
    "in fact , based on its colors and magnitudes @xcite assigned a spectral type of a2ib to object 7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there exist a - type supergiants with similar h@xmath0 emission line profiles .",
    "for example , the a5ia - o star b324 in m33 shows an h@xmath0 emission line with a narrow core and broad wings , but m33 b324 is not known to exhibit variability and can not be classified as an lbv @xcite .",
    "similarly , the _ hst _ photometric measurements of object 7 by @xcite and by @xcite do not show significant variations from 1991 to 2002 .",
    "the lack of large - amplitude variability from 30 yr to 40 yr after the light maximum is in sharp contrast with the variability of @xmath1 car after its great eruption .",
    "therefore , even if object 7 is an lbv in a dormant state , its blue color and lack of variability are unlike known lbvs that have gone through super - outbursts , such as @xmath1 car .",
    "what is the nature of the sn1961v event ?",
    "the radio observations indicate the existence of a decades - old sn .",
    "it is possible that the sn exploded in 1961 and was responsible for the light maximum of sn1961v .",
    "it is also possible that the sn exploded prior to 1961 and did not contribute directly to the light curve of sn1961v . in the latter case , the light maximum of sn1961v",
    "might be caused by a catastrophic but not fatally - explosive event of a massive star , then the spatial coincidence would make object 7 the most probable candidate for the survivor , but the event can not have been a super - outburst from an @xmath1 car - like lbv . as the radio sn and object 7 are both coincident with sn1961v ( well within 20 pc ) , there is a non - negligible possibility that all three objects are related to one another through a binary system similar to the situation in sn1993j , where a massive binary companion of the sn progenitor is recently identified @xcite .",
    "we speculate that object 7 could be a massive binary companion of the radio sn s progenitor .",
    "either the sn itself or the sn ejecta impact on object 7 may be responsible for the light curve of sn1961v .",
    "the impact of sn ejecta on object 7 injects energy into its atmosphere and causes it to expand and form the broad h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "similar interactions have been suggested for the binary companions of type ia sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have learned from sn1961v that the late evolution of massive stars is complex and confusing .",
    "numerous parameters can affect the appearance of a sn or an outburst .",
    "systematic studies of a large number of peculiar sne are needed . in the meantime , it is necessary to monitor object 7 photometrically and spectroscopically in the future for variability in order to achieve a better understanding of its nature and relationship with sn1961v .",
    "we have obtained _ hubble space telescope _ stis images and spectra of the stars in the vicinity of sn1961v .",
    "the stis image shows that sn1961v and a number of massive stars are inside a supershell with two regions located on the shell rim . using a new astrometric solution",
    ", we find object 7 of @xcite to be the closest to sn1961v .",
    "furthermore , object 7 is the only point source detected in our stis spectra , and only its h@xmath0 emission is detected .",
    "the h@xmath0 line profile of object 7 is remarkably similar to that of @xmath1 car , but its blue color ( similar to an a2ib supergiant ) and lack of significant variability are unlike any known lbvs at 30 - 40 yr after a super - outburst .",
    "the nonthermal spectral index and declining radio luminosity of sn 1961v are consistent with those of decades - old sne .",
    "we have obtained vlba observations of sn1961v at 18  cm ; the non - detection of sn1961v places a lower limit on the size of the radio - emitting region , 7.6 mas or 0.34 pc .",
    "this implies an average expansion velocity in excess of 4,400 km  s@xmath2 , much higher than the optical expansion velocity measured in 1961 .",
    "such discrepant expansion velocities have been observed in other sne , such as sn1986j .",
    "we conclude that a sn has occurred in the vicinity of sn1961v .",
    "the physical nature of sn1961v s light curve remains uncertain .",
    "if it was associated with a great eruption of a massive star , object 7 is the most probable survivor , but its color and lack of significant variability differ from a post - outburst @xmath1 car - type lbv .",

    "<S> we conclude the following : ( 1 ) a sn occurred in the vicinity of sn1961v a few decades ago . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) if the sn1961v light maximum originates from a giant eruption of a massive star , object 7 is the most probable candidate for the survivor , but its blue color and lack of significant variability are different from a post - outburst @xmath1 car . ( 3 ) the radio sn and object 7 could be physically associated with each other through a binary system . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) object 7 needs to be monitored to determine its nature and relationship to sn1961v . </S>"
