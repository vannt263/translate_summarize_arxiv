    "the question of the nature of dark matter ( dm ) , which forms nearly one - fourth of the total mass in the universe , is a pivotal question for cosmology , astrophysics , and particle physics .",
    "other than its relic density @xcite , little is known about the structure of dm .",
    "recently , there has been great excitement that new information about dm may be revealed by the results from the pamela satellite @xcite claiming an increase in positron fraction in cosmic rays with energies above @xmath3 .",
    "others , including the ppb - bets @xcite and hess @xcite experiments , also claim enhancements in electron / positron flux for energies above @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , the fermi collaboration released a measurement of the @xmath5 flux in the @xmath6 to @xmath7 range @xcite .",
    "all of these experiments are consistent with a new primary source contributing to local electron / positron fluxes in the @xmath8 range @xcite .",
    "these anomalies in cosmic ray fluxes may well originate from astrophysical sources such as pulsars or nearby supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "however , they might also result from the presence of dm particles , providing a golden opportunity to learn more about the properties of dm .",
    "this intriguing possibility has led to a number of proposals that interpret the data as arising from dark matter annihilation @xcite ( which necessitates an @xmath9 boost factor ) or decays @xcite ( which must proceed much slower than the present value of the hubble parameter ) . moreover ,",
    "pamela , while reporting an excess in the electron / positron flux , claims no excess in the proton / anti - proton flux @xcite .",
    "thus , one intriguing idea is that the dm carries lepton number , _",
    "e.g. _ , it is composed of right - handed scalar neutrinos ( sneutrinos ) in minimal @xcite and extended @xcite supersymmetric models .",
    "this framework might explain the preference for leptonic annihilation / decay products @xcite .    in the simplest extensions of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) that include right - handed neutrinos , the right - handed neutrinos are gauge singlets .",
    "hence the strength of their yukawa interactions with the standard model ( sm ) fields governs whether they thermalize together with the rest of the mssm matter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lightest sneutrino @xmath10 is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and therefore is a potentially viable dm candidate , it can be produced with the right relic density from the decays of heavier superpartners @xcite .",
    "if the heavier right - handed scalar neutrino @xmath11 is the next - to - lightest superpartner ( nlsp ) , its lifetime turns out to be longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "therefore , decays of @xmath11 should still be active , resulting in observable effects like the excess energetic electrons / positrons in cosmic rays . in the mssm with right - handed neutrinos",
    ", these features have been analyzed with respect to the observed cosmic ray anomalies @xcite .",
    "however , such right - handed sneutrino dark matter scenarios generically suffer from two aesthetic problems : _",
    "( i ) _ the origin of the suppressed dirac neutrino yukawa couplings ( though such small couplings are allowed on the basis of technical naturalness @xcite ) , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the origin of the supersymmetric @xmath2 parameter @xcite . in this paper , we present a @xmath1-extended mssm model in which these aesthetic problems are remedied , and the desirable features of sneutrino dm , including the ability to account for the pamela positron excess , can be correctly produced .",
    "it is well known that the mssm suffers from a naturalness problem due to the presence of the superpotential bilinear operator @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "though the mass parameter @xmath2 enters from the superpotential , it must be of the order of the mass terms associated with the supersymmetry breaking sector . this puzzle can be remedied by extending the matter and gauge structure of the mssm , _",
    "e.g. _ within unified and/or string models @xcite . to this end ,",
    "theories with an extra @xmath13 broken at the electroweak- to- tev scale by sm singlets are known to be able to generate an appropriately sized @xmath2 parameter ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath13 symmetry can also play a crucial role in generating neutrino masses .",
    "the right - handed neutrino sector and the @xmath2 parameter can be correlated for both majorana @xcite and dirac masses @xcite .",
    "we assume here that lepton number is an accidental symmetry that is conserved at the perturbative level .",
    "hence , the neutrinos are dirac fermions , requiring yukawa couplings of @xmath14 .",
    "these couplings are technically natural , but an explanation for such a strong suppression is clearly desirable .",
    "one way this can occur is if the @xmath13 invariance suppresses leading order contributions to dirac neutrino masses and allows higher - dimensional operators @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we assume that the @xmath1 charges satisfy @xmath15 to forbid the bare @xmath2 term , and @xmath16 to forbid a bare neutrino yukawa coupling .",
    "after including an sm - singlet chiral superfield @xmath17 , the relevant part of the superpotential takes the form @xcite @xmath18 in which the @xmath13 invariance requires @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the above",
    ", @xmath21 is a large mass scale , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the yukawa couplings responsible for generating the @xmath2 parameter and neutrino masses . upon the breaking of the electroweak and @xmath13 gauge symmetries , the effective low energy parameters include the @xmath2 parameter @xmath24 and dirac neutrino masses @xmath25 the effective neutrino",
    "yukawa coupling @xmath26 leads to neutrino masses in good agreement with experiment : @xmath27 for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 hence , in this framework the @xmath2 problem is resolved and appropriately suppressed dirac neutrino masses are generated upon @xmath13 breaking .",
    "parameter values were chosen to obtain neutrino masses which are in the right range . in the next sections ,",
    "we give more details of the spectrum constrained by the experimental data .",
    "to account for the anomalous cosmic ray fluxes , there arise several additional constraints on the model .",
    "first , we assume the right - handed neutrino superfields are _ total gauge singlets _ to avoid unacceptably fast decays that would otherwise occur via gaugino mediated processes .",
    "second , the @xmath13 charges must be assigned such that the successful generation of the @xmath2 parameter and neutrino masses are maintained .",
    "the option that we pursue in this work is to have a ",
    "higgs - philic \" @xmath13 , similar in spirit to @xcite . enforcing these constraints leads to the charge assignments displayed in table [ charges ] .",
    "note that of the mssm fields , only the right - handed up quarks @xmath31 and the higgs fields @xmath32 and @xmath17 have nonvanishing @xmath13 charges .",
    "the charge assignment in table [ charges ] is anomalous as it stands .",
    "however , all gauge and gravitational anomalies can be cancelled either by invoking family - dependent @xmath13 charges as in @xcite ( though in this case one needs to worry about constraints from flavor violation ) , or by augmenting the matter content of the theory by sets of vector - like quark and lepton fields , as well as additional sm singlets that are charged under the @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "the details will be addressed somewhere else in our future studies .    with this charge assignment ,",
    "scattering processes that involve @xmath32 , @xmath17 and @xmath31 are influenced by the @xmath13 gauge boson ( @xmath33 ) and the @xmath13 gaugino ( @xmath34 ) @xcite . at hadron colliders , the right - handed up - type quarks ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) can undergo drell - yan annihilation through @xmath33 to produce higgs fields .",

    ", we will assume that the soft supersymmetry breaking sector of the theory is such that the lightest right - handed sneutrino @xmath10 is the lsp and the next - to - lightest right - handed sneutrino @xmath11 is the nlsp .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the remaining superpartner masses , including the heaviest right - handed sneutrino , @xmath61 .",
    "the third heavy particle , the nnlsp , is chosen to be the lightest neutralino , @xmath62 and it requires special attention since it decays late enough to have some non - thermal contribution to the dm relic density .",
    "the hadronic big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) constraints will also be considered for the late decaying particles in the model .",
    "we discuss these issues further in the next section .      for the spectrum considered above",
    ", the dm has two components , the stable lsp and the practically stable nlsp which lives longer than the age of the universe . together",
    ", their relic density should reproduce the wmap @xcite result .",
    "the right - handed sneutrino population forms during the cosmic evolution from the decays of the mssm spectrum plus exotics , which , with a few exceptions , should already have reached thermal equilibrium .",
    "a given sparticle decays into right - handed sneutrinos with a rate @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the conversion rate into right - handed sneutrinos is quadratic in the effective neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath64 , and the growth of the lsp number density is fast enough to produce the observed dm relic density @xcite .    we expect the third sneutrino to also decay to the lsp at freeze - out and thus contribute to the relic density .",
    "however , in our chosen parameter space , this sneutrino is taken very heavy ( quantified below ) , much heavier than other sparticles .",
    "it would likely mix more with the left - handed sneutrino and decay very quickly compared to the nlsp .",
    "our detailed analysis shows that its life - time ( @xmath65 sec ) is larger than its freeze - out time ( @xmath66 sec ) but its non - thermal contribution to the relic density is negligible since the branching ratio for decaying into lsp or nlsp is suppressed ( less than @xmath67 ) .    the right - handed sneutrinos exhibit a non - thermal distribution .",
    "to see this , recall that the right - handed sneutrinos mix with the left - handed sneutrinos and therefore interact with the gauge sector . for",
    "right - handed sneutrino annihilation , only a four - point interaction , a left - handed sneutrino , or a higgsino exchange can contribute .",
    "the annihilation is out of equilibrium as long as the interaction rate is smaller than the expansion rate @xmath68 .",
    "the rate of the four - point interaction @xmath69 , since @xmath70 .",
    "the left - handed sneutrino and higgsino exchanges also have rates @xmath71 , and hence the right - handed sneutrinos do not thermalize before the electroweak phase transition .",
    "this is maintained after the phase transition if the mixing with the active ( left - handed ) sneutrino is small @xcite .",
    "for a detailed calculation of the relic density , the model must be considered in detail and all the mixings , masses and branching ratios must be determined so that we would calculate the relic density by counting all possible channels .",
    "moreover , we need to evaluate the would - be relic density of the late decaying nnlsp which is computed with through conventional methods .",
    "we implement the model fully into the calchep @xcite package program with the help of lanhep @xcite program .",
    "once the calchep model files are provided , we use the micromegas @xcite software for calculating the nnlsp relic density .    in the implementation , we consider a normal hierarchy for the neutrinos and chose the mixing parameters to be @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the parametrization of the mixing matrix is identical to the one in the quark sector and the additional cp - violating phases are taken zero . as the positron excess is proportional to the neutrino masses , we keep these non - zero , consistent with the following constraints : @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with the dileptonic decay rate  ( [ rate ] ) in that for the parameter choice in ( [ inputs ] ) , one finds @xmath241 leading to a @xmath240 lifetime .",
    "this arises from the small @xmath242 ratio that sets the neutrino mass scale .",

    "note that there is no contribution to the positron production from the third right - handed sneutrino since it only lives @xmath244 sec and thus decays much faster .",
    "in contrast to the case of the mssm with right - handed neutrinos @xcite , the @xmath2 term and the neutrino yukawa couplings are induced dynamically in our model .",
    "the two models also differ in terms of the predicted correlation between the neutrino masses  ( [ mneut ] ) and the dileptonic decay rate  ( [ rate ] ) . in the mssm",

    "we follow the procedure in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "the source term of the diffusion equation is @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the number density of the nlsp , @xmath255 is the lifetime ( which will be set as a free parameter to be fit ) , and @xmath256 is the energy distribution of @xmath257 from the decay @xmath258 . before proceeding to evaluate @xmath256",
    ", we first determine @xmath255 .    since both the lsp and the nlsp are components of the dm , other particles decay to either of them .",
    "then , the ratio of the number densities of the lsp and nlsp should be equal to the ratios of the branching rates into either state .",

    "there are two unknown in the left hand side of ( [ ndensity_1 ] ) .",
    "the second relation needed arises from the mass density of the dm , @xmath264 , as @xmath265 where @xmath266 is further parametrized by adopting the navarro - frank - white density profile @xcite .",
    "for the diffusion parameters , we use the three sets from models m1 , m2 and med @xcite .",
    "we return to the evaluation of the @xmath256 term .",

    "it is also possible to explain the fermi - lat data , which requires a slightly larger lifetime for the dm and works well for energies up to 500 gev .",
    "having discussed the electron / positron excess as well as the total flux , we now consider briefly the issue that no significant excess was observed in the anti - proton flux @xcite . unlike the case of the leptonic decays , the hadronic decays are generated only through the @xmath315-term interactions in the superpotential .",
    "the relevant interaction terms in the lagrangian are given by @xmath316 in which @xmath317 ( @xmath318 ) are the neutral cp - even higgs bosons and @xmath319 is the fraction of @xmath317 in @xmath320 @xcite .",
    "higgs bosons @xmath317 produced in the @xmath321 decay @xcite further decay into pairs of quarks ( including top quark pairs as suggested by the mass spectrum in ( [ inputs ] ) and in table [ spectrum ] , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons .",
    "the decay rate to quarks is @xmath322 the integrated dalitz density has the functional form @xmath323\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath324 , @xmath325 , and @xmath326 .",
    "the light quarks are produced directly or indirectly through heavy quark , gauge boson , and higgs boson decays , and hadronize to produce protons and anti - protons .",
    "an inspection of  ( [ rateq ] ) and  ( [ rate ] ) shows that the anti - proton signal is suppressed compared to the positron signal by a kinematic factor of order @xmath327 , which is @xmath328 for @xmath329 quarks and @xmath330 for @xmath331 quarks , as needed for consistency with pamela  @xcite .",
    "however , the higgs bosons that are produced in nlsp to lsp decays fragment efficiently into gauge bosons and top quarks , which in turn give off light quarks and anti - quarks with no apparent yukawa suppression .",
    "moreover , the leptons produced with the rate given in  ( [ rate ] ) can give rise to hadronic final states at the loop level .",
    "these indirect contributions are expected to yield anti - protons with an efficiency around @xmath332 @xcite .    the needed suppression of the anti - proton flux with respect to the positron flux can stem from various effects , such as the interaction strengths in  ( [ lagran ] ) .",
    "one way to suppress @xmath333 with respect to @xmath334 is to have @xcite @xmath335 which imposes an overall suppression on the flavor - changing entries of the neutrino yukawa matrices with respect to the flavor - conserving entries . a justification or realization of such a structure",
    "would in principle require a detailed knowledge of the flavor structure of  ( [ mneut ] ) .",
    "however , it is worth noting that there is no direct correspondence in general between the right - handed neutrino and the active ( left - handed ) neutrino sectors , which can lend credence for the needed suppression .",
    "we have presented a simple extension of the mssm with an additional @xmath1 gauge symmetry that couples predominantly to higgs fields . while other sneutrino dark matter models have been proposed to explain the cosmic ray observations , the model presented here does so while also resolving the naturalness problems of the mssm . in this model , an electroweak scale @xmath2 term and",
    "appropriately suppressed dirac neutrino masses are generated upon @xmath1 breaking .",
    "the right - handed sneutrinos @xmath336 and @xmath11 are the lightest and next - to - lightest superpartners , allowing for a natural explanation of pamela and other experiments like atic and fermi - lat in the context of sneutrino dark matter .",
    "a complete study of the dm relic density in this model includes contributions from the lsp and the nlsp , which is essentially stable with respect to the lifetime of the universe .",
    "we also analysed the contributions coming from late decaying particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , particles that decay after freeze - out . for the parameter set in ( [ inputs ] ) , we obtain @xmath337 for the total relic density of right - handed sneutrino , consistent with the current wmap value .",
    "we then discussed the pamela , atic and fermi - lat data , considering @xmath338 as the source decay for the observed positron excess .",
    "the possibility of producing a final positron through muon is also discussed separately .",
    "the suppression of the anti - proton flux compared to the positron flux suggests the model - building constraint that the flavor - changing entries of the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix are suppressed with respect to the flavor - conserving entries .",
    "the fitted lifetimes for the dm , of the order of @xmath339 sec , fit the pamela data well for positron energies greater than @xmath340 gev , as well as the atic and fermi - lat cases . the fit is better for the m1 and med models described in the text .",
    "it can be concluded from the values of the fitted lifetimes that it maybe possible to explain the pamela+atic and fermi - lat data simultaneously in the corresponding energy ranges , though the fermi - lat data requires a slightly larger lifetime values for the dm . in principle , it is foreseeable that a better scan of the model parameters as well as implementing an improved fitting procedure could offer an even closer simultaneous explanation of these three sets of experimental data .",

    "<S> one of the right - handed senutrinos is the lsp . </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic and hadronic decays of another sneutrino , taken to be the next - to - lightest superpartner , allow for a natural fit to the recent results reported by the pamela experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed calculation of the dark matter relic density in this scenario , and show that the model is consistent with the atic and fermi - lat experiments . </S>"
