    "the origin of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays above @xmath0  ev is still unknown  @xcite . their energy spectrum ,",
    "arrival directions and composition can be inferred from air shower observations .",
    "however , agreement has not yet been reached on whether there is a break in the energy spectrum around @xmath1  ev (= 60 eev ) .",
    "such a steepening in the energy spectrum is expected if uhe cosmic rays come from cosmologically distant sources  @xcite , as is suggested by their overall isotropy .",
    "there have been claims , as yet unconfirmed , for clustering on small angular scales , and correlations with possible classes of sources .",
    "moreover , results concerning the nuclear composition are still inconclusive .",
    "while this deficit of robust observational results is partly due to the extremely small fluxes and , correspondingly , small numbers of events at such high energies , discrepancies might arise also from the different experimental techniques used .",
    "for instance , the determination of the primary energy from the ground array alone relies on the comparison with air shower simulations and is thus prone to uncertainties in modelling high energy interactions .",
    "therefore it is essential to test results from air shower observations independently .",
    "the present work provides just such a cross - check for the upper limit derived previously from ground arrays on the photon fraction in uhe cosmic rays .",
    "an upper limit is set on the photon fraction above 10  eev which is twice as strong as those given previously .",
    "photons are expected to dominate over nucleon primaries in non - acceleration ( `` top - down '' ) models of uhe cosmic - ray origin  @xcite which have been invoked in particular to account for a continuation of the flux above @xmath2 without a spectral feature as indicated by agasa data  @xcite .",
    "thus , the determination of the photon contribution is a crucial probe of cosmic - ray source models .",
    "separating photon - induced showers from events initiated by nuclear primaries is experimentally much easier than distinguishing light and heavy nuclear primaries . as an example",
    ", average depths of shower maxima at 10  eev primary energy are predicted to be about 1000  g  @xmath3 , 800  g  @xmath3 , and 700  g  @xmath3 for primary photons , protons , and iron nuclei , respectively .",
    "moreover , analyses of nuclear composition are uncertain due to our poor knowledge of hadronic interactions at very high energies .",
    "photon showers , being driven mostly by electromagnetic interactions , are less affected by such uncertainties and can be modelled with greater confidence . to avoid the uncertainty from modelling hadronic interactions , we adopt an analysis method that does not require the simulation of nuclear primaries but compares data to photon simulations only .",
    "so far limits on the uhe photon fraction in cosmic rays have been set by ground arrays alone . by comparing the rates of near - vertical showers to inclined ones recorded by the haverah park shower detector , upper limits ( 95% c.l . ) of 48% above 10  eev and 50% above 40  eev were deduced  @xcite . based on an analysis of muons in air showers observed by the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) , the upper limits ( 95% c.l . )",
    "to the photon fraction were estimated to be 28% above 10  eev and 67% above 32  eev  @xcite .",
    "an upper limit of 67% ( 95% c.l . ) above 125  eev was derived in a dedicated study of the highest energy agasa events  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we obtain a photon limit from the _ direct _ observation of the shower profile with fluorescence telescopes , using the depth of shower maximum @xmath4 as the discriminating observable . to achieve a high accuracy in reconstructing the shower geometry , we make use of the `` hybrid '' detection technique , i.e. we select events observed by both the ground array and the fluorescence telescopes  @xcite . for a subset of the event sample ,",
    "a sufficient number of ground detectors were also triggered , yielding a variety of additional shower observables .",
    "considering as example the signal risetime measured with the ground array , we demonstrate the discrimination power of these independent observables to photon - induced showers .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec - photons ] , predictions for the uhe photon fraction in cosmic - ray source models and features of photon - initiated air showers are summarized .",
    "section  [ sec - data ] contains the description of the data and of photon simulations .",
    "in particular , the data selection criteria are discussed . a careful choice of the quality and fiducial volume cuts is required to control a possible experimental bias for photon primaries . in section  [ sec - results ] ,",
    "the method for deriving a photon fraction is described and applied to the data .",
    "an example of the discrimination power of observables registered by the surface array is shown in section  [ sec - sd ] . finally in section  [ sec - outlook ] , we discuss the prospects for improving the bound on uhe photons .",
    "the theoretical challenge of explaining acceleration of protons to the highest energies is circumvented in non - acceleration models  @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the uhe cosmic rays are predicted by these models to be photons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , uhe photons may be produced uniformly in the universe by the decay / annihilation of relic topological defects ( td )  @xcite . during propagation to earth",
    ", they interact with background radiation fields and most of them cascade down to gev energies where the extragalactic photon flux is constrained by the egret experiment ; the remaining uhe photons can contribute to the cosmic - ray flux above 10  eev .",
    "by contrast in the super heavy dark matter ( shdm ) model  @xcite , the uhe photons are generated in the decay of relic metastable particles ( such as `` cryptons '' @xcite ) which are clustered as cold dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "since the halo is believed to be effectively transparent to such uhe photons , they would be directly observed at earth with little processing . in the z - burst ( zb ) scenario  @xcite ,",
    "photons are generated from the resonant production of z bosons by uhe cosmic neutrinos annihilating on the relic neutrino background .",
    "a distinctive feature of all these models is the prediction of a large photon flux at high energies , as is expected from considerations of qcd fragmentation @xcite . as an illustration , figure  [ fig - specshdm ] ( taken from  @xcite ) shows a shdm model fit to the highest energy agasa events ; photons are the dominant particle species above @xmath5  ev .    ) and protons ( @xmath6 ) from shdm , and an assumed additional nucleonic component at lower energy ( p ) , as well as their sum is plotted .",
    "photons dominate above @xmath5  ev .",
    "( figure taken from  @xcite . ) , height=491 ]    photons can also be produced in `` conventional '' acceleration models by the gzk - type process from @xmath7 decays .",
    "typically , the corresponding photon fluxes are relatively small . for instance , based on the spectrum obtained by the hires experiment  @xcite , the expected photon fraction is only of order 1% or below  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the photon flux arriving at earth for a specific source model is subject to uncertainties arising from photon propagation : assumptions concerning the very low frequency ( few mhz ) radio background and inter - galactic magnetic fields must be made  @xcite .",
    "the typical range of energy loss lengths usually adopted for photons are 715  mpc at 10  eev and 530  mpc at 100  eev .",
    "ultra - high energy photons can be detected by the particle cascades they initiate when entering the atmosphere of the earth .",
    "compared to air showers initiated by nuclear primaries , photon showers at energies above 10  eev are in general expected to have a larger depth of shower maximum @xmath4 and to contain fewer secondary muons .",
    "the latter is because the mean free paths for photo - nuclear interactions and direct muon pair production are more than two orders of magnitude larger than the radiation length .",
    "consequently , only a small fraction of the primary energy in photon showers is generally transferred into secondary hadrons and muons .",
    "@xmath4@xmath8 versus energy simulated for primary photons , protons and iron nuclei . depending on the specific particle trajectory through the geomagnetic field , photons above @xmath5  ev can create a pre - shower : as indicated by the splitting of the photon line , the average @xmath4 values then do not only depend on primary energy but also arrival direction . for nuclear primaries , calculations for different hadronic interaction models",
    "are displayed ( qgsjet 01  @xcite , qgsjet ii  @xcite , sibyll 2.1  @xcite ) . also shown",
    "are experimental data ( for references to the experiments , see  @xcite ) . , height=328 ]    in figure  [ fig - xmaxvse ] , simulated @xmath4 values for showers initiated by primary photons , protons and iron nuclei are shown as a function of the primary energy .",
    "the large @xmath4 values for photon showers at 10  eev are essentially due to the small multiplicity in electromagnetic interactions , in contrast to the large number of secondaries produced in inelastic interactions of high - energy hadrons . secondly , because of the lpm effect  @xcite , the development of photon showers is even further delayed above @xmath9  10  eev .",
    "another feature of the lpm effect is an increase of shower fluctuations : @xmath4 fluctuations for photon showers are @xmath9  80  g  @xmath3 at 10  eev , compared to @xmath9  60  g  @xmath3 and @xmath9  20  g  @xmath3 for primary protons and iron nuclei , respectively .    at higher energies",
    ", cosmic - ray photons may convert in the geomagnetic field and create a pre - shower before entering the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "the energy threshold for geomagnetic conversion is @xmath9  50  eev for the auger southern site .",
    "conversion probability and pre - shower features depend both on primary energy and arrival direction . in the case of a pre - shower",
    ", the subsequent air shower is initiated as a superposition of lower - energy secondary photons and electrons . for air showers from converted photons , the @xmath4 values and the fluctuations are considerably smaller than from single photons of same total energy . from the point of view of air shower development , the lpm effect and pre - shower formation",
    "compete with each other .    in this work , cascading of photons in the geomagnetic field is simulated with the preshower code  @xcite and shower development in air , including the lpm effect  @xcite , is calculated with corsika  @xcite . for photo - nuclear processes",
    ", we assume the extrapolation of the cross - section as given by the particle data group  @xcite , and we employed qgsjet  01  @xcite as a hadron event generator .",
    "the auger data used in this analysis were taken with a total of 12 fluorescence telescopes situated at two different sites  @xcite , during the period january 2004 to february 2006 .",
    "the number of surface detector stations deployed  @xcite grew during this period from about 150 to 950 .",
    "a detailed description of the auger observatory is given in  @xcite .",
    "for the present analysis , we selected hybrid events , i.e. showers observed both with ( one or more ) surface tanks and telescopes .",
    "even when only one tank is triggered , the angular accuracy improves from @xmath10 for observation with one telescope alone to @xmath9  0.6@xmath11 for hybrid detection  @xcite , thus reducing significantly the corresponding uncertainty in the reconstruction of @xmath4 .",
    "the reconstruction of the shower profiles  @xcite is based on an end - to - end calibration of the fluorescence telescopes  @xcite .",
    "monthly models for the atmospheric density profiles are used which were derived from local radio soundings  @xcite .",
    "an average aerosol model is adopted based on measurements of the local atmospheric aerosol content  @xcite .",
    "cloud information is provided by ir monitors , positioned at the telescope stations  @xcite .",
    "cross - checks on clouds are obtained from measurements with lidar systems ( near the telescopes ) and with a laser facility near the center of the array  @xcite .",
    "the cherenkov light contribution of the shower is calculated according to  @xcite .",
    "an energy deposit profile is reconstructed for each event .",
    "a gaisser - hillas function  @xcite is fitted to the profile to obtain the depth of shower maximum , and the calorimetric shower energy is obtained by integration .",
    "it has been checked that this function provides a reasonable description of the simulated shower profiles independent of the primary particle , provided all four parameters of the gaisser - hillas fit are allowed to vary .",
    "a correction for missing energy , the `` invisible '' energy fraction carried by neutrinos and high - energy muons , has to be applied .",
    "the fraction of missing energy depends on the primary particle type . in case of nuclear primaries ,",
    "the correction amounts to 714% , with a slight dependence on primary energy and the hadronic interaction model used  @xcite . for photon primaries ,",
    "the missing energy fraction is much smaller and amounts to @xmath9  1%  @xcite .",
    "we applied the correction assuming photon primaries , so that the energy threshold chosen in the analysis corresponds to the effective energy of primary photons .",
    "for the current analysis , the differences between the energy estimates for different primaries are relatively small ( @xmath9  10% ) due to the near - calorimetric measurement of the primary energy by the fluorescence technique . moreover , relative to photon showers , the energies of nuclear primaries are slightly underestimated .",
    "this would slightly _ deplete _ an event sample from showers ascribed to nuclear primaries or , correspondingly , increase the number ascribed to photons .",
    "thus , the limit derived here for photons is conservative with respect to the missing energy correction .",
    "it seems worthwhile to mention that for ground array studies , where the energy of photons can be underestimated by more than 30% ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) , such corrections to the primary energy which depend on the unknown primary particle type must be treated with particular caution .",
    "the following quality cuts are applied for event selection ( in appendix  [ app - cut ] , distributions of cut variables are displayed ) :    * quality of hybrid geometry : distance of closest approach of the reconstructed shower axis to the array tank with the largest signal @xmath121.5  km , and difference between the reconstructed shower front arrival time at this tank and the measured tank time @xmath12300  ns ; * primary energy e@xmath810@xmath13  ev ; * @xmath4 observed ; * number of phototubes in the fluorescence detector triggered by shower @xmath146 ; * quality of gaisser - hillas ( gh ) profile fit : @xmath15(gh ) per degree of freedom @xmath126 , and @xmath15(gh)/@xmath15(line)@xmath120.9 , where @xmath15(line ) refers to a straight line fit ; * minimum viewing angle of shower direction towards the telescope @xmath815@xmath11 ; * cloud monitors confirm no disturbance of event observation by clouds .",
    "care must be taken about a possible bias against photon primaries of the detector acceptance . in figure",
    "[ fig - acc ] we show the acceptance for photons and nuclear primaries at different steps of the analysis , computed using shower simulations with the conex code  @xcite which reproduces well the corsika predictions for shower profiles .",
    "light emission and propagation through the atmosphere and the detector response were simulated according to  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the acceptances are comparable for all types of primaries after trigger ( top plot ) . however , after profile quality cuts ( middle plot ) the detection efficiency for photons is smaller by a factor @xmath92 than for nuclear primaries , because primary photons reach shower maximum at such large depths ( of about 1000  g  @xmath3 , see figure  [ fig - xmaxvse ] ) that for a large fraction of showers the maximum is outside the field of view of the telescopes .",
    "this holds , in particular , for near - vertical photon showers : since the auger observatory is located at an average atmospheric depth of 880  g  @xmath3 ( measured at a point close to the centre of the array ) near - vertical photon showers reach the ground before being fully developed .",
    "such photon showers are rejected by the quality cuts , while most of the showers generated by nuclear primaries ( with their smaller @xmath4 ) are accepted .",
    "an illustration of the effect of this cut on photon showers is given in figure  [ fig - sketch ] . to reduce the corresponding bias against photons , near - vertical events are excluded in the current analysis .",
    "since the average depth of shower maximum increases with photon energy before the onset of pre - shower , a mild dependence of the minimum zenith angle with energy is chosen ( see below ) .",
    "for similar reasons , a cut on distant events is introduced .",
    "the telescopes do not observe shower portions near the horizon , as the field of view is elevated by @xmath9  1.5@xmath11 .",
    "thus , the atmospheric depth which corresponds to the lower edge of the field of view of a telescope decreases with distance .",
    "another source of a bias against photon showers is due to fluorescence light absorption .",
    "the brightest parts of the shower profile , i.e.  those around shower maximum , are for photon showers generally closer to the ground .",
    "the line of sight towards the shower maximum traverses regions of higher air density .",
    "hence , for similar geometrical distances to the shower maximum , the light signal of the deeper photon showers is more attenuated than for nuclear primaries .",
    "the consequence is that the distance range below which the telescopes are fully efficient for detecting showers of a given energy , is smaller for photon primaries than for nuclear primaries .",
    "this range increases with primary energy .",
    "thus , an energy - dependent distance cut is applied for the data selection , in addition to excluding showers at small zenith angles :    * zenith angle  @xmath835@xmath16 , with @xmath17ev@xmath18 for @xmath19ev@xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath19ev@xmath819.7 ; * maximum distance of telescope to shower impact point  @xmath1224  km  +  @xmath22 , with @xmath23ev@xmath24  km .    .",
    "for near - vertical photon showers , @xmath4 is below the field of view of the telescopes ; possibly the showers even reach ground before being fully developed as in the example shown .",
    "such photon showers were rejected by the quality cuts .",
    "the situation changes when regarding more inclined photon events .",
    "the slant atmospheric depth that corresponds to the lower edge of the field of view increases with zenith .",
    "@xmath4 can then be reached within the field of view , and the photon showers pass the @xmath4 quality cut . requiring a minimum zenith angle in the analysis , the reconstruction bias for photons is strongly reduced . ,",
    "height=328 ]    the acceptances after the fiducial volume cuts are applied are shown in figure  [ fig - acc ] ( bottom plot ) .",
    "the differences between photons and nuclear primaries are now significantly reduced , with the acceptances being comparable at energies 1020  eev . with increasing energy",
    ", the acceptance for nuclear primaries shows a modest growth , while the photon acceptance is quite flat in the investigated energy range . only a minor dependence on the nuclear particle type ( proton or iron )",
    "is seen . comparing photons to nuclear primaries ,",
    "the minimum ratio of acceptances is @xmath25 at energies 5060  eev . at even higher energies ,",
    "the pre - shower effect becomes increasingly important , and acceptances for photons and nuclear primaries become more similar .    the acceptance curves shown in figure  [ fig - acc ] can be used to correct for the detector acceptance when comparing a measured photon limit to model predictions , using the model energy spectra as an input . since the acceptance ratios after the fiducial volume cuts are not far from unity , and since the photon acceptance is quite flat in the energy range below 100  eev , the corresponding corrections are expected to be relatively small and to differ very little between typical model predictions . in this work , to obtain an experimental limit to the photon fraction without relying on assumptions on energy spectra of different primaries , a correction to the photon limit is applied by conservatively adopting the minimum ratio of acceptances @xmath26 ( a detailed derivation of the approach is given in appendix  [ app - acc ] ) .        applying the cuts to the data , 29 events with energies greater than 10  eev",

    "however , observables registered by the surface array are also sensitive to the primary particle type and can be exploited for studies of primary photon showers . in spite of the incomplete coverage of the array during the data taking period considered here ( which means many events were poorly contained ) , for about half of the selected events a standard array reconstruction  @xcite can be performed .",
    "several observables can then be used for primary photon discrimination , for instance the lateral distribution or the curvature of the shower front  @xcite .",
    "an example for another observable is given by the _ risetime _ of the shower signal in the detectors , one measure of the time spread of particles in the shower disc .",
    "for each triggered tank , we define a risetime as the time for the integrated signal to go from 10% to 50% of its total value . by interpolation between risetimes recorded by the tanks at different distances to the shower core",
    ", the risetime at 1000  m core distance is extracted after correcting for azimuthal asymmetries in the shower front .",
    "the risetime is sensitive to the primary particle type because of its correlation with shower muons and the depth of shower maximum : contrary to the shower muons , electrons undergo significant deflections with corresponding time delays .",
    "thus , larger values for the risetime are observed if the signal at ground is dominated by the electromagnetic shower component .",
    "primary photon showers generally have fewer muons and , additionally , the shower maximum is closer to ground compared to showers from nuclear primaries .",
    "correspondingly , risetimes are expected to be relatively large for photon primaries .",
    "( point with error bar ) compared to the risetime distribution expected for photon showers ( solid line ) .",
    ", height=328 ]    for the specific event shown in figure  [ fig - evprof ] , the measured risetime is compared to the simulated distribution in figure  [ fig - evrise ] . for this and the other hybrid events with array reconstruction",
    ", the observed risetime does not agree well with the predictions for primary photons , supporting the conclusion that a photon origin of the observed events is not favored .",
    "in future photon analyses , the independent information on the primary particle from the auger ground array and fluorescence telescope data can be used to cross - check each other . combining the different shower observables",
    "will further improve the discrimination power to photons .",
    "the upper limit to the photon fraction above 10  eev derived in this work from the direct observation of the shower maximum confirms and reduces previous limits from ground arrays .",
    "the current analysis is limited mainly by the small number of events .",
    "the number of hybrid events will considerably increase over the next years , and much lower primary photon fractions can be tested . moreover , the larger statistics will allow us to increase the threshold energy above 10  eev where even larger photon fractions are predicted by some models .    as an example",
    ", let us consider an increase in data statistics above 10  eev by about an order of magnitude compared to the current analysis , as is expected to be reached in 2008/2009 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , a sensitivity to photon fractions down to @xmath9  1.5% can be inferred .",
    "more realistically , let us assume for the measured @xmath4 values a distribution similar to the one currently observed as in figure  [ fig - sigma ] .",
    "then , an upper limit of @xmath9  5% could be achieved . with the increased run time , a comparable number of events as for the present analysis would be reached above 3035  eev .",
    "if an upper limit similar to that reached here was found , but at this higher energy , it would be well below existing limits and severely constrain non - acceleration models .",
    "the sensitivity of the hybrid analysis might be further improved in the future by combining different shower observables measured in the same event , such as depth of shower maximum , risetime and curvature .",
    "we did not include ground array observables for the limit derived in this analysis since we wanted to independently check previous ground array results .",
    "further information , e.g.  the width of the shower profile , might also be added in future work to achieve better separation of deeply penetrating nuclear primaries and primary photons .    if only surface detector data is used and hybrid detection is not required then the event statistics are increased by about an order of magnitude .",
    "care must however be taken about a possible bias against photons in an array - only analysis because of the different detector acceptance for photon and nuclear primaries .",
    "also , compared to the near - calorimetric energy determination in the fluorescence technique , the energy estimated from array data shows a stronger dependence on the primary type and is more strongly affected by shower fluctuations .",
    "ways to reduce a possible photon bias and to place robust limits to photons are being investigated .",
    "for instance , the technique introduced in  @xcite of comparing event rates of near - vertical and inclined showers can be further exploited .    _",
