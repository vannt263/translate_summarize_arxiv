    "recently , the matter field can give rise to an accelerated expansion [ 1 ] for the universe stems from the observational data regarding the luminosity - redshift relation of type ia supernovae [ 2,3 ] up to about @xmath0 .",
    "this matter field is called quintessence matter ( shortly q - matter ) .",
    "this q - matter can behave like a cosmological constant [ 4,5 ] by combining positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "so there must be this q - matter either neglected or unknown responsible for this accelerated universe . at the present epoch , a lot of works has been done to solve this quintessence problem and most popular candidates for q - matter has so far been a scalar field having a potential which generates a sufficient negative pressure . since in a variety of inflationary models",
    "scalar fields have been used in describing the transition from the quasi - exponential expansion of the early universe to a power - law expansion , it is natural to try to understand the present acceleration of the universe , which has an exponential behaviour too , by constructing models where the matter responsible for such behaviour is also represented by a scalar field [ 6 ] .",
    "however , now we deal with the opposite task , i.e. , we would like to describe the transition from a universe filled with dust - like matter to an exponentially expansion universe and scalar fields are not the only possibility but there are ( of course ) alternatives .",
    "different forms for the quintessence energy have been proposed .",
    "they include a cosmological constant ( or , more generally a variable cosmological term ) a scalar field [ 4,7 ] a frustrated network of non - abelian cosmic strings and a frustrated network of domain wall [ 8,9 ] . all these proposal assume the q - matter behaves as a perfect fluid with a linear barotropic equation of state and so some effort has been invested in determining its adiabatic index at the present epoch [ 10,11 ] .",
    "recently , chimento et al [ 12 ] showed that a combination of dissipative effects such as a bulk viscous stress and a quintessence scalar field gives an accelerated expansion for an open universe ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "very recently , banerjee et al [ 13 ] also have shown that it is possible to have an accelerated universe with bd - theory in friedmann model without any matter .",
    "+ the possibility that the speed of light @xmath2 might vary has recently attracted considerable attention [ 14 - 20 ] . in a cosmological",
    "setting , the variations in @xmath2 have been shown to solve the cosmological puzzles - the horizon , flatness and lambda problems of big - bang cosmology .",
    "the variations of velocity of light can also solve the quasi - lambda problems .",
    "for power - law variations in the velocity of light with the cosmological scale factors , barrow et al [ 16 ] have shown that flatness problem can be solved .",
    "the machian vsl scenario in which @xmath3 , introduced by barrow [ 15 ] has significant advantages to the phase transition scenario in which the speed of light changes suddenly from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , preferred by albrecht and magueijo [ 14 ] . for changing @xmath2 , the geometry of the universe is not affected .",
    "we have allowed a changing @xmath2 to do the job normally done by  superluminal expansion \" .",
    "the basic assumpssion is that a variable @xmath2 does not induce corrections to curvature in the cosmological frame and that einstein s equations , relating curvature to stress energy are still valid .",
    "the rationale behind this postulate is that @xmath2 changes in the local lorentzian frames associated with cosmological expansion .",
    "the effect is a special relativistic effect , not a gravitational effect .",
    "therefore curvature should not feel a changing @xmath2 . in a cosmological setting the postulate proposed implies that brans - dicke field equations remains valid even when @xmath6 .",
    "magueijo et al [ 21 ] find the metrices and variations in @xmath2 associated with the counterpart of black holes , the outside of star and steller collapse .",
    "the variation upon the theme are vsl theories which explicitely break local lorentz invariance , such as the one proposed by albrecht and magueijo [ 14 ] and for which black hole solutions remain exclusive .",
    "+ this paper investigates the possibility of obtaining a non - decelerating expansion ( @xmath7 ) for the universe in bd theory with varying speed of light in anisotropic models of the universe .",
    "we consider the line - element of anisotropic space - time model    @xmath8    where @xmath9 are functions of time only and    @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the spatial curvature index , so that the above three types [ 22 ] models are euclidean , closed and semi - closed respectively .",
    "+ now , the bd - field equations with varying speed of light are    @xmath12-\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\phi}}{\\phi } \\right)^{2}-\\frac{\\ddot{\\phi}}{\\phi}\\ ] ]    @xmath13    and the wave equation for the bd scalar field @xmath14 is    @xmath15    here the velocity of light @xmath2 is an arbitrary function of time , @xmath16 is the bd coupling parameter . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are density and hydrostatic pressure respectively of the fluid distribution with barotropic equation of state    @xmath19    ( @xmath20 being the constant adiabatic index of the fluid with @xmath21 ) . + from the above field equations , we have the ` non - conservation ' equation    @xmath22    as at the present epoch the universe is filled with cold matter ( dust ) with negligible pressure , so using @xmath23 , the equation ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) gives    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    now eliminating @xmath17 between ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we have    @xmath26    since the scale factors , scalar field and velocity of light are time dependent , so we shall consider the following cases to obtain exact analytic form for the variables assuming some of them in polynomial form or in exponential form .",
    "+ _ case i _ : the power law form of scale factors @xmath9 and bd scalar field @xmath27 are assumed as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 are positive constants and @xmath30 are real constants with the restriction @xmath31 ( for accelerating universe ) . + if we use the relations ( 9 ) in ( 8) , we have    @xmath32    where the positive constant @xmath33 is restricted as    @xmath34    also from ( 6 ) the expression for @xmath17 is    @xmath35    with @xmath36    for consistency of the field equations the restriction between the parameters is    @xmath37+\\frac{1}{4}\\ ] ]    _ case ii _ : the exponential form of scale factors and bd scalar field are assumed as    @xmath38    where @xmath29 are positive constants and @xmath30 are real constants . + from ( 8) , we have @xmath39    where the positive constant @xmath33 will satisfy    @xmath40    from ( 6 ) , the expression for @xmath17 is @xmath41    with  @xmath42 . + from field equations",

    "it is to be noted that the above differential equation can be solved for all @xmath11 .",
    "but for @xmath56 the solutions are not consistent to the field equations .",
    "so we consider only @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the explicit solution is    @xmath58    with @xmath59 as integration constants .",
    "+    the deceleration parameter has the expression    @xmath60 } { [ ( 3\\omega+2)(a_{_{0}}+a_{_{1}}t)+a_{_{1}}(3\\omega+4)t]^{2}}$ ] ,    which is finite for all @xmath47 and @xmath16 except @xmath61 and we have the non - decelerated universe for @xmath62 .",
    "also we have the non - decelerated universe asymptotically except for @xmath63 .",
    "the variation of @xmath46 over time has been shown graphically for different values of @xmath16 in figures 1 - 5 .",
    "one important aspect of this model is that it can solve the flatness problem as well . to see this we make a conformal transformation [ 23 ] as    @xmath64    which enables us to identify the energy contributions from different components of matter very clearly .",
    "+ in this section , we have developed the bd theory in jordan frame and to introduce the einstein frame , we make the following transformations :    @xmath65    so the field equations ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) transformed to    @xmath66    @xmath67    and    @xmath68    where   @xmath69 .",
    "+ the scalar field @xmath70 ( massless ) behaves like a ` stiff ' perfect fluid with equation of state    @xmath71    if the velocity of light is constant , then in einstein frame total stress - energy tensor is conserved but there is an exchange of energy between the scalar field and normal matter according to the following equation    @xmath72=-\\frac{\\psi'}{2}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{_{f}}- \\frac{3\\bar{p}_{_{f}}}{c^{2}}\\right)\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if the velocity of light varies then we have separate ` non - conservation ' equations    @xmath73    and    @xmath74    thus combining the two energy densities , we have from the above equations , the equation for the conservation for the total energy is    @xmath75    here @xmath76 is the hubble parameter in the einstein frame and @xmath77 is the net barotropic index defined as    @xmath78    where    @xmath79    is the dimensionless density parameter .",

    "this equation in @xmath83 shows that @xmath84 is a possible solution of it and for stability of this solution , we have    @xmath85    since the adiabatic indices do not change due to conformal transformation so we take @xmath86 ( since @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 . hence from ( 33 ) and",

    "+ from the field equation ( 26 ) , the curvature parameter @xmath91 vanishes for the solution @xmath84 .",
