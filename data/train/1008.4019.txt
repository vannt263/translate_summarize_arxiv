    "the phase - field crystal ( pfc ) model has rapidly gained popularity in recent years as a potentially powerful tool to simulate the evolution of materials with atomistic resolution on time scales that are orders of magnitude larger than those that can be attained by molecular dynamics simulations . while it was originally @xcite inspired by phenomenological equations developed in the general context of pattern formation @xcite , it has now been established @xcite that it can be obtained as a simplification of classical density functional theory ( dft ) of freezing @xcite .    to make the pfc model useful for practical applications in materials science",
    ", it has to be established how the model parameters need to be chosen in order to reproduce the physical properties of a given material as closely as possible .",
    "this is currently a very active area of research , and several contributions of the present volume are dedicated to this subject .",
    "one of the most fundamental properties of a material is of course its crystal structure .",
    "as detailed below , the original pfc model @xcite contains only two parameters : a scaled global density @xmath0 and a scaled temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the latter indicates the distance to the critical point of the pfc model , which is located at @xmath2 . for small @xmath1 , the pfc model exhibits , besides the unstructured liquid phase , periodic solutions of nematic ( stripe ) and hexagonal symmetry in two dimensions , and of bcc symmetry in three dimensions",
    "recently , it was found that for larger values of @xmath1 , fcc and hcp structure also exist in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath1 also controls several other properties of the model , such as the width of the solid - liquid interfaces and their interfacial free energy . since , to match a given material , these quantities need to be adjusted independently ,",
    "more degrees of freedom are needed in the model .",
    "it turns out that it is not straightforward to obtain periodic ground states with symmetries that differ from the `` natural '' ones .",
    "this is due to the physics which governs the formation of periodic states in the pfc model : the liquid state is unstable with respect to the formation of periodic solutions if their wavelength falls within a narrow band centred around a characteristic length scale .",
    "the periodic density patterns that correspond to crystalline phases are stabilised by nonlinear terms , which lead to the interaction ( resonance ) of density waves with different unstable wave vectors .",
    "the hexagon / bcc and stripe patterns arise from the simplest nonlinearities involving triadic and quartic resonances of wave vectors with equal modulus , respectively , which explains their ubiquity in nature @xcite .",
    "this also naturally explains why new structures appear for larger values of @xmath1 @xcite : since the range of unstable wavelengths increases with @xmath1 , new resonances become possible .    a way to control the selection of crystal structures is thus to modify the nonlinear resonances .",
    "two ways to do this have been explored in the literature , both inspired by earlier work in the physics of pattern formation .",
    "the first idea is to make _ two _ bands of wavelengths unstable , and to use the ratio between the two characteristic wavelengths as an additional geometric parameter which allows to stabilise patterns of a certain symmetry @xcite . using this approach , pfc models with a ground state of fcc symmetry",
    "were recently developed @xcite . while these models are robust and versatile , they have two potential drawbacks , namely ( i ) in the analogy with dft",
    ", the two distinct length scales should arise from two distinct peaks in the liquid structure factor ; for the simplest version of the model , a structure factor that is very different from those typically measured has to be used , and ( ii ) the equation of motion for the density field contains spatial derivatives of up to 10th order , which makes simulations in geometries that can not easily be handled in reciprocal space very cumbersome",
    ".    the second approach , which will be our main focus , is to add new nonlinear terms to the model which modify the strength of the resonances and can thus favour patterns of different symmetries . here",
    ", we will restrict our investigations to two dimensions , where the obvious missing state is a square pattern .",
    "the question of how a square pattern can arise from a rotationally invariant homogeneous state has been extensively studied in the context of convection patterns @xcite , because squares can be observed under certain experimental conditions .",
    "it has been demonstrated that simple additional nonlinearities can stabilise squares @xcite , and that squares can coexist with hexagons @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological equations have already been used to study the transition from hexagonal to square symmetry upon a change of the control parameters , in a spirit very close to the one of the pfc model , before that name was actually coined @xcite .",
    "the geometric properties of grain boundaries between two domains of square symmetries have also been studied @xcite .",
    "finally , isolated patches of squares in coexistence with the unstructured state ( `` oscillons '' ) have also been found in similar equations @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate whether it is possible to use this approach to design a simple and robust pfc model with square symmetry .",
    "we find that it is indeed straightforward to obtain squares as well as coexistence of squares and hexagons following the recipes found in the literature .",
    "in contrast , square - liquid coexistence can only be obtained with a combination of several nonlinear terms and carefully tuned parameters .",
    "we develop a systematic approach to determine suitable parameter ranges that yield stable square - liquid interfaces , and confirm our analytic calculations by numerical simulations .",
    "we also evaluate the elastic coefficients of the square solid for the parameters used in the simulations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we define the model and recall the calculation of nonlinear resonances and the resulting selection of symmetry . in section [ sec :",
    "states ] we calculate the free energies of the various periodic patterns in a generalised pfc model in two dimensions , with particular emphasis on square - liquid coexistence .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] presents the comparison between our analytic results and numerical calculations ; the elastic coefficients are evaluated in section [ sec : elastic ] , and section [ sec : conclusions ] gives a brief conclusion .",
    "for the purpose of exposition , we start with the standard pfc model @xcite , which has the dimensionless free energy functional @xmath3 \\psi + { \\psi^4 \\over 4 } \\right\\ } , \\label{energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a dimensionless particle density measured from a constant reference value , and @xmath1 is a constant .",
    "this form of the free energy functional was originally proposed by swift and hohenberg as a phenomenological description of patterns that emerge in various hydrodynamical systems @xcite . in this context",
    ", @xmath1 is the distance from the bifurcation threshold at which the unstructured ( quiescent ) state becomes unstable .",
    "we have used dimensionless units in which the modulus of the characteristic wave number is unity , and energy and time have been scaled by appropriate quantities as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the manner by which this free energy functional and its parameters can be related to classical dft is detailed in @xcite and need not be repeated here .    in the original swift - hohenberg equation , @xmath4 is a linear combination of the deviations of the temperature and velocity fields from the quiescent state .",
    "it is treated as a non - conserved order parameter , and thus the system is free to evolve towards the global free energy minimum . in contrast , in the pfc model the field @xmath4 is a local particle density and hence a conserved quantity .",
    "this provides an additional control parameter , namely , the average density @xmath5 .",
    "the free energy of periodic states can be evaluated using the one - mode approximation , in which the density field is given by a sum of density waves , @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the principal reciprocal lattice vectors of the considered structure ( with @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 is the amplitude of the density waves , where we have used the fact that for a homogeneous solid all density waves have the same amplitude , @xmath10 .",
    "this ansatz is inserted into the free energy functional , and the result is integrated over one unit cell . in this procedure ,",
    "all terms that contain oscillatory exponential factors integrate out , and only the products of exponentials in which two , three , or four of the @xmath7 s sum up to zero contribute to the final result .",
    "thus , non - trivial contributions arise from the triadic and quartic resonances .",
    "whereas the latter can generate stripes ( or squares , see below ) , hexagonal and bcc ordered phases are stabilised by triadic resonances because the principal reciprocal lattice vectors are able to form `` triads '' ( i.e. , closed triangles , for example , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for bcc lattices ) . the cubic terms that are needed for triadic resonances to occur are generated by the expansion of the @xmath14 term : @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , they are absent for @xmath16 and become increasingly important with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "this explains the sequence of phases found in the phase diagram of the pfc model @xcite with increasing @xmath17 : rolls ( stripes ) @xmath18 hexagons @xmath18 liquid in two dimensions , and rolls @xmath18 hexagons @xmath18 bcc @xmath18 liquid in three dimensions .",
    "in addition , since the free energy expressed in terms of @xmath9 contains terms in @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , the bifurcation from liquid to hexagons can be transcritical , and a first - order transition from liquid to hexagons / bcc with a finite coexistence zone in @xmath0 is possible .",
    "in contrast , for crystals with square , simple - cubic and face - centred - cubic lattices , no triads can be formed , and the free energy contains only terms in @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "this makes the transition from liquid to squares supercritical , and it was shown by weakly nonlinear analysis @xcite that solid - liquid coexistence is impossible under these conditions .    from the above considerations , we can conclude that the model has to fulfil three requirements in order to obtain square - liquid coexistence .",
    "first , the quartic resonances need to favour squares rather than stripes , second the transition from squares to liquid must be subcritical to give rise to solid - liquid coexistence , and third the square state must have a lower free energy than hexagons even in the presence of triadic resonances that occur for @xmath22 .",
    "we will address these questions in the following , and we will develop a systematic approach to determine coefficients that favour periodic states with cubic symmetry .",
    "let us first discuss nonlinear terms that can be used to favour squares in two dimensions . to this end , it is useful to consider rhombi , that is , a density field composed just of two sets of density waves with wave vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which have equal magnitude @xmath25 and form an arbitrary angle @xmath26 between them , @xmath27 .",
    "\\label{rhombi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , there are no triadic resonances .",
    "the quartic resonances generated by the @xmath14 term in equation ( [ energy ] ) give a result that is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , this term does not favour any particular symmetry .",
    "one possibility of an `` anisotropic '' term , used in the literature @xcite , is a term proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the laplace operator . here",
    ", we consider a more general set of nonlinear terms of the form @xmath30 in the free energy functional , where @xmath31 are constant coefficients . following the procedure outlined above ,",
    "we obtain @xmath32 substituting equation  ( [ rhombi ] ) into equation  ( [ nonlinear ] ) yields @xmath33 , \\label{theta_dep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the volume of one unit cell .",
    "together with the vector addition properties illustrated in figure  [ fig : vectors ] , @xmath35 ) can be rewritten as @xmath36   \\nonumber \\\\ & = &    f_{\\rm isotropic } + f_{\\rm anisotropic}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is independent of the angle @xmath26 , but depends on @xmath0 , and the anisotropic part of the free energy that depends on the angle and thus on the symmetry of the pattern is @xmath38 for @xmath39 , the dependence on @xmath26 in the anisotropic part vanishes because of the trigonometric identity @xmath40 . however , for @xmath41 , the anisotropic part of the free energy is a simple function of @xmath26 which is minimised by @xmath42 if @xmath43 and by @xmath44 if @xmath45 .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath46 ; however , the square symmetry is favoured when @xmath47 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath48 , the anisotropic part of the free energy contains higher order harmonics , which suggests a possible means to favour arbitrary angles between density waves by an appropriate combination of such terms .",
    "give rise to a @xmath26-dependent free energy through the above vector addition operations.[fig : vectors],scaledwidth=95.0% ]    0.2 cm    another type of nonlinearity used in the literature @xcite to favour squares is @xmath49 . indeed , repeating the above calculation for rhombi with a term of the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 a constant , we find @xmath52 which can again be split in an isotropic and an anisotropic part . the anisotropic part is minimised for @xmath53 if @xmath54 .",
    "note that , in this case , the isotropic part does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the above calculations are valid both in two and three dimensions . in three dimensions ,",
    "an angle of @xmath55 between density waves corresponds to a simple cubic structure , which can therefore be obtained in a straightforward manner using this method .      for crystal structures without triadic interactions , since to lowest order the free energy can be expressed in even powers of @xmath9 , a subcritical bifurcation is required for solid - liquid coexistence .",
    "the generic form of a free energy that exhibits a subcritical bifurcation is @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 controls the growth rate of small perturbations of the liquid state ( linear stability ) ; the liquid is stable for @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath14 term in the standard pfc free energy functional shown in equation  ( [ energy ] ) results in a @xmath0-dependent quadratic coefficient . within the one - mode approximation , for this model @xmath61 for density waves with wave number @xmath25 .",
    "all nonlinear terms discussed so far yield contributions up to order @xmath21 . to obtain the necessary contribution in @xmath62 ,",
    "some higher order nonlinearity needs to be added .",
    "an obvious possibility would be just @xmath63 , which was indeed used in @xcite to model oscillons .",
    "the problem with this choice is that for @xmath64 it generates additional cubic and quintic terms in the free energy that tend to lower the free energy for hexagonal and bcc phases . as a consequence",
    ", this nonlinearity tends to generate the sequence squares @xmath18 hexagons @xmath18 liquid in the phase diagram ; this was the case for all the cases that we have investigated .",
    "an alternative choice , which will be made in the following , is to add @xmath65 to the free energy , which generates terms of order @xmath62 , but no additional terms depending on @xmath0 .",
    "as will be shown below , it is indeed possible to generate a subcritical bifurcation that favours squares by using both @xmath66 and @xmath65 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "however , the resulting square - liquid equilibrium is metastable , whereas the state of lowest energy are hexagons . in order to be able to adjust the respective energies of these states",
    ", we must also include the nonlinear terms of the form @xmath28 and @xmath69 discussed previously .",
    "the procedure how to choose appropriate coefficients for all these terms will be detailed in the next section .",
    "the free energy functional considered in the following is @xmath70 \\psi + { \\psi^4 \\over 4 } + { g_{4 } \\over 4 } \\psi^2 \\delta^2 \\psi^2 + { g_{6 } \\over 4 } \\psi^2 \\delta^3 \\psi^2 + \\right .",

    "the corresponding density fields in the one - mode approximation of equation  ( [ one - mode ] ) are @xmath71 where we recall that @xmath25 is the magnitude of the principal reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the free energy is computed by substituting equation  ( [ ansatz ] ) into equation  ( [ f_sub_cubic ] ) and integrating over one unit cell , which yields @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the free energy density , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the free energy density of the liquid .",
    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath25 are determined by minimising the above free energy with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath25 . one important difference with respect to the standard pfc model should be noted . in the latter",
    ", @xmath25 appears only in the gradient term .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 and @xmath9 decouple , and the value of @xmath25 that minimises the free energy is always equal to unity .",
    "in contrast , the new terms introduce nonlinear couplings between @xmath9 and @xmath25 , which implies that both quantities depend in a nontrivial way on the parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath25 and @xmath9 which minimise @xmath75 are found numerically for each structure using the newton - raphson method and are then substituted into equations  ( [ roll_energy ] ) , ( [ square_energy ] ) and ( [ hex_energy ] ) to obtain the free energy density for different patterns .     for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "a common tangent line between the liquid and square free energy curves is drawn ( thick dashed line ) to illustrate the existence of a wide coexistence region.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    0.2 cm    let us first check whether square - liquid coexistence can be obtained using only the terms proportional to @xmath51 and @xmath81 .",
    "in figure  [ fig:1n2_f ] we plot the free energies of squares and liquid for @xmath82 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the common - tangent construction shows that there indeed exists a wide coexistence region as a result of the bifurcation being subcritical .",
    "however , the square - liquid coexistence is metastable for these parameters , since both the roll and the hexagonal phases have a lower energy , as shown in figure  [ fig:1n2_f ] .",
    "note that , since the cubic term which generates hexagons breaks the symmetry between @xmath9 and @xmath83 , there are two distinct hexagon solutions that correspond to different values of @xmath9 , which are labelled as `` hex-1 '' and `` hex-2 '' respectively in the graphs . to modify this ordering of the free energies , we need to include the terms proportional to @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the following ,",
    "we give a systematic procedure to choose appropriate values for the coefficients .",
    "we first consider the stability of rolls and squares . as discussed",
    "previously , choosing the coefficients of the anisotropic terms of the right sign favours squares .",
    "however , for fixed coefficients , the relative energies of the phases may still depend on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "since the solid - liquid coexistence occurs near the density at which the solid and liquid free energy curves intersect , stable square - liquid coexistence is only possible if the intersection of the square and liquid free energy curves occurs at a larger value of @xmath17 than the one for rolls and liquid .",
    "the following analysis focuses on determining the conditions for the nonlinear coefficients for which this is the case .",
    "the principal reciprocal lattice vectors of rolls and squares can not form triads ; thus , the free energy density of rolls and squares has the general form for a subcritical bifurcation given by equation  ( [ f246 ] ) , @xmath86 where the subscript @xmath87 ( solid ) denotes rolls or squares .",
    "the solid and liquid free energy curves intersect when the free energy difference of solid and liquid becomes zero , @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , the free energy of the solid must be minimised with respect to @xmath9 , which yields @xmath89 .",
    "these two relations yield @xmath90 comparing equations  ( [ roll_energy ] ) , ( [ square_energy ] ) and ( [ hex_energy ] ) to equation  ( [ sub_energy ] ) , we obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 and 3 for rolls , squares and hexagons , respectively .",
    "since the exponential growth rate of perturbations with wave number @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath94 , in order to obtain an unconditionally stable liquid at large values of @xmath17 , @xmath59 must have a finite lower bound which leads to @xmath95 the intersection of solid and liquid free energy curves is obtained by combining equations  ( [ abc ] ) and ( [ apsi ] ) , which yields @xmath96 the wave numbers @xmath25 that minimise the free energy of rolls and squares are different .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath81 this difference is small so that we can safely neglect it . under this assumption , the intersection point of solid and liquid free energy curves",
    "is solely dictated by the value of @xmath97 .",
    "the condition that @xmath98 then yields inequalities between the coefficients which are given in the appendix .",
    "the most important result is that this condition can only be satisfied if @xmath85 is non - zero .      for hexagons",
    ", the free energy contains a cubic term due to triadic interactions , @xmath99 where @xmath100 in the standard pfc model , the cubic term changes the bifurcation from supercritical to transcritical which not only make hexagons the favoured phase , but also makes hexagon - liquid coexistence possible in the limit of a weakly first - order freezing transition .",
    "the cubic term plays a similar role in the subcritical case : it lowers the free energy for hexagons by an amount proportional to @xmath17 . in order to make square symmetries favourable",
    ", we require the cubic coefficient @xmath101 to be small for @xmath0 close to the square - liquid coexistence region . then , the subcritical bifurcation analysis developed in the previous section still gives a good estimate of the intersection points for the free energy curves of hexagons and liquid and can thus be used to evaluate the relative stability of squares and hexagons .",
    "this requirement on @xmath101 and the condition for a stable liquid are illustrated graphically in figure  [ alphas ] for @xmath102 .",
    "the condition that the liquid remains linearly stable for large values of @xmath0 requires that @xmath103 .",

    "the results indeed display the expected quadratic behaviour for @xmath143 , and the elastic constants are , in our dimensionless units , @xmath144 the shear modulus is @xmath145 , and the ( two - dimensional ) bulk modulus @xmath146 .",
    "the ratio of the bulk modulus and the shear modulus is about 24 .",
    "thus , for the parameters chosen here the square patterns generated by our model are rather `` soft '' with respect to shear deformation , but have a perfectly well - defined finite shear modulus .",
    "several remarks can help to understand this fact .",
    "a shear deformation corresponds , in reciprocal space , to a change of the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors , whereas their length remains unchanged to first order in @xmath140 . since we have found that the free energy depends on this angle if anisotropic terms are present according to equation ( [ anisotropy ] ) , this directly gives a finite contribution to the shear modulus .",
    "note , however , that this is not the only contribution .",
    "indeed , since the change in the angle modifies the strength of the nonlinearities which saturate the density waves , the amplitude @xmath9 also depends on the deformation , which modifies the contributions of all the other terms in the functional .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the bifurcation also comes into play . for a subcritical bifurcation",
    ", @xmath9 can be appreciable even for small @xmath1 , which means that the anisotropic terms , though proportional to @xmath21 or @xmath62 , may be comparable to the quadratic contribution which determines the elastic constants in the standard pfc model .",
    "note that the above calculation of the elastic constants uses the one - mode approximation , which is not very accurate in view of the results shown in figure  [ amps ] .",
    "however , it is sufficient for our main purpose here , which was to demonstrate that the shear modulus is finite . for a more quantitative evaluation of the elastic constants ,",
    "multi - mode calculations or direct numerical computations are mandatory .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the elastic constants here only for one specific set of coefficients .",
    "how they depend on the various parameters in the free energy functional is an interesting subject for further investigations .",
    "we have presented a general method of constructing a free energy functional for the pfc model that exhibits solid - liquid coexistence with desired crystal symmetries .",
    "we have demonstrated that the crystal symmetries in the pfc model can be controlled through additional nonlinear terms . in particular , we have examined the influence of nonlinearities such as @xmath147 and @xmath148 on crystal symmetries . besides the squares that have been investigated here , other structures can potentially be obtained by using terms with @xmath149 , since these terms contain higher order harmonics that can be used to favour well - defined angles between density waves .    we have also presented a systematic procedure for constructing free energy functionals that exhibit square - liquid coexistence as the ground state .",
    "this requires ( i ) a subcritical bifurcation from the liquid to the square state , and ( ii ) a suitable combination of the nonlinear coefficients which favours squares over rolls and , at the same time , makes triadic resonances small enough to avoid hexagons .",
    "our analytical results obtained in the one - mode approximation are borne out qualitatively by numerical simulations : in both simulations and analytics the square lattice is the ground state until it loses its stability to the liquid at large @xmath17 .",
    "the one - mode approximation , however , does not predict accurately the amplitude and free energy for square lattices .",
    "a multi - mode approximation is needed to quantitatively describe the square symmetry since the principal lattice vectors of the square lattice are strongly coupled to higher order modes .",
    "nevertheless , the one - mode analysis provides a good guideline for determining coefficients of nonlinearities to obtain the desired crystal symmetries .",
    "we have obtained stable square - liquid coexistence , and the solid exhibits a finite shear modulus , which makes this model suitable for simulations .",
    "a drawback is that several nonlinear terms are needed , and that a delicate balance between the coefficients needs to be respected .",
    "we have only tested one specific set of coefficients , but we expect that the properties of the model ( elastic constants , interfacial properties ) can be varied by exploring the parameter space of the various coefficients . it should also be noted that our survey of potential nonlinear terms is by no means complete .",
    "however , the relation between the coefficients and the resulting model properties is highly non - trivial , which implies that the process of finding a set of coefficients that yield a match with some desired materials properties is likely to be cumbersome .",
    "furthermore , our final equation of motion ( [ evolution ] ) is of 8th order in space , which is only two orders lower than the one of the two - mode model @xcite .",
    "a highly interesting perspective is the extension of this work to three dimensions .",
    "the calculation of the anisotropy performed in section [ sec : model ] remains valid in three dimensions , which means that it is straightforward to obtain simple cubic structures .",
    "furthermore , since it has been found that the free energies of bcc , fcc , and hcp phases in three dimensions in the standard pfc model are not very different for a certain range of @xmath1 @xcite , the addition of anisotropic terms may be used to control their relative stability .",
    "this work was supported by joint funding under eu strp 016447 magdot and nsf dmr award no . 0502737 .",
    "here , we give the details concerning the calculation of the intersection points between liquid and solid free energies and the resulting conditions for the coefficients in the free energy functional .",
    "we start with rolls and squares .",
    "as outlined in section  3.2 , we need to compare the values of @xmath150 , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the coefficients of equation ( [ sub_energy ] ) for a generic subcritical bifurcation . comparing equations  ( [ roll_energy ] ) and ( [ square_energy ] ) to equation  ( [ sub_energy ] )",
    ", we obtain the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 for rolls and squares , @xmath151 where @xmath152 the subcritical bifurcation requires the quartic coefficient to be negative , which according to equation  ( [ f246 ] ) implies @xmath153 this determines an upper bound for @xmath51 , @xmath154 the condition that the intersection of the square and liquid free energy curves occurs at a higher value of @xmath17 than that of rolls and liquid ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) , yields @xmath155 which can be reduced to the inequality @xmath156 where @xmath157 the solution of @xmath158 exists only if the upper bound of @xmath158 obtained from equation  ( [ beta_condition ] ) is greater than the lower bound obtained from equation  ( [ psi_condition ] ) , which yields @xmath159 the above inequality holds if ( a ) @xmath160 and @xmath161 or ( b ) @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "it is helpful to rewrite the expression of @xmath164 as @xmath165 for the case that @xmath166 , we have @xmath167 and the solution of @xmath51 only exists if @xmath168 .",
    "however , this requires @xmath84 to be negative which contradicts the condition for stable liquid shown in equation  ( [ stable_liq ] ) .",
    "thus it is essential to include the nonlinear term @xmath69 in the free energy functional so that the free energy functional exhibits the desired properties of ( i ) stable liquid , ( ii ) subcritical bifurcation , and ( iii ) @xmath98 .    for hexagons , the coefficients @xmath59 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58",
    "are given by equation  ( [ hex_coef ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath101 of the cubic term is assumed to be small , such that this term can be neglected .",
    "then , the condition that @xmath169 requires @xmath170 yielding the inequality @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 together with equation  ( [ beta_condition ] ) , we find that either ( a ) @xmath174 and @xmath175 or ( b ) @xmath176 and @xmath177 has to be fulfilled in order to make @xmath178 .",
