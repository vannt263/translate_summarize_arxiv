    "from recent observations it is strongly believed that the most interesting problems of particle physics cosmology are the origin due to accelerated expansion of the present universe . the observation from type ia supernovae [ 1,2 ] in associated with large scale structure [ 3 ] and cosmic microwave background anisotropies(cmb ) [ 4 ]",
    "have shown the evidences to support cosmic acceleration .",
    "the theory of dark energy is the main responsible candidate for this scenario . from recent cosmological observations including supernova data [ 5 ] and measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation(cmbr ) [ 4 ] it is evident that our present universe is made up of about 4% ordinary matter , about 74% dark energy and about 22% dark matter .",
    "several interesting mechanisms have been suggested to explain this feature of this universe , such as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) [ 6 ] , modified gravity [ 7 ] , higher dimensional phenomena [ 8 ] , brans - dicke theory [ 9 ] , brane - world model [ 10 ] and many others .",
    "+ recently many cosmological models have been constructed by introducing dark energies such as phantom [ 11 ] , tachyon scalar field [ 12 ] , hessence [ 13 ] , dilaton scalar field [ 14 ] , k - essence scalar field [ 15 ] , dbi essence scalar field [ 16 ] , and many others . after realizing that many interesting of particle interactions need more than four dimensions for their formulation , the study of higher dimensional",
    "theory has been revived .",
    "the model of higher dimensions was proposed by kaluza and klein [ 17,18 ] who tried to introducing an extra dimension which is basically an extension of einstein general relativity in 5d .",
    "the activities of extra dimensions also verified from the stm theory [ 19 ] proposed recently by wesson et al [ 20 ] .",
    "as our space - time is explicitly four dimensional in nature so the ` hidden ' dimensions must be related to the dark matter and dark energy which are also ` invisible ' in nature . + form the cosmological observation the present phase of acceleration of the universe is not clearly understood .",
    "standard big bang cosmology with perfect fluid assumption fails to accommodate the observational fact .",
    "recently , ellis and maartens [ 21 ] have considered a cosmological model where inflationary cosmologies exist in which the horizon problem is solved before inflation begins , no big - bang singularity exist , no exotic physics is involved and quantum gravity regime can even be avoided .",
    "an emergent universe model if developed in a consistent way is capable of solving the conceptual problems of the big - bang model .",
    "actually the universe starts out in the infinite past as an almost static universe and expands slowly , eventually evolving into a hot big - bang era .",
    "an interesting example of this scenario is given by ellis , murugan and tsagas [ 22 ] , for a closed universe model with a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath4 , which has a special form of interaction potential @xmath5 .",
    "there are several features for the emergent universe [ 21,23 ] viz .",
    "( i ) the universe is almost static at the finite past , ( ii ) there is no time like singularity , ( iii ) the universe is always large enough so that the classical description of space time is adequate , ( iv ) the universe may contains exotic matter so that the energy condition may be violated , ( v ) the universe is accelerating etc .",
    "+ here we also consider another two scenarios : ( i )  intermediate scenario \" and ( ii )  logamediate scenario \" [ 24 - 27 ] to study of the expanding anisotropic universe in the presence of different scalar fields . in the first case",
    "the scale factors evolves separately as @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "so the expansion of the universe is slower than standard de sitter inflation ( arises when @xmath12 ) but faster than power law inflation with power greater than 1 .",
    "the harrison - zeldovich spectrum of fluctuation arises when @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the second case",
    "we analyze the inflation with scale factors separately of the form @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . when @xmath20 this model reduces to power law inflation .",
    "the logamediate inflationary form is motivated by considering a class of possible cosmological solutions with indefinite expansion which result from imposing weak general conditions on the cosmological model .",
    "+ in this work , we have considered n - dimensional einstein field equations in which 4-dimensional space - time is described by a frw metric and that of the extra @xmath2-dimensions by an euclidean metric .",
    "we also consider the universe is filled with k - essence scalar field , normal scalar field , tachyonic field and dbi essence and investigate the natures of the dark energy candidates for emergent , intermediate and logamediate scenarios of the universe . here in extra dimensional",
    "phenomenon we have shown the change of the potential @xmath5 corresponding to the field @xmath4 for the dark energies mentioned above and also analyze the anisotropic universe using the  _ slow roll_ parameters in hamilton - jacobi formalism and in terms of above mentioned scalar field @xmath4 and they are given by [ 24 ]    @xmath21\\ ] ]    sahni et al [ 28 ] proposed the trajectories in the \\{@xmath22 } plane corresponding to different cosmological models to depict qualitatively different behavior .",

    "finally we graphically analyzed geometrical parameters @xmath29 in the higher dimensional anisotropic universe in emergent , logamediate and intermediate scenarios of the universe .",
