    "@xmath0 scuti variables are stars with masses between 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath1 located at the intersection of the classical cepheid instability strip with the main sequence .",
    "these variables are thought to be excellent laboratories for probing the internal structure of intermediate mass stars .",
    "intents of modelling @xmath0 scuti stars belonging to open clusters have been performed recently ( e.g. [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] ) .",
    "although the constraints imposed by the cluster parameters have proved to be very useful when modelling an ensemble of @xmath0 scuti stars , more detected frequencies in individual stars would improve current seismic studies .",
    "the target star v650 tau ( hd 23643 , @xmath2 , a7 ) was identified as a short - period pulsating variable by breger ( 1972 ) .",
    "intensive observations performed by the stephi network in november 1990 , revealed four frequency peaks in v650 tau [ 4 ] .",
    "one - site ccd photometric observations carried out by [ 5 ] in november - december 1993 , confirmed the results obtained by the stephi campaign . since then , no new observations of v650 tauri have been performed .",
    "the present paper provides preliminary observational results of a three - site campaign on v650 tauri in 2008 .",
    "three observatories were involved in the observational campaign . they are listed in table  [ tab : tel ] together with the telescopes and instruments used .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] gives the log of observations .",
    "a total amount of 164 hours of useful data were obtained from the three sites .",
    "the observations were obtained through a johnson @xmath3 filter except at the spm observatory where a strmgren @xmath4 filter was used .",
    "table  [ tab : stars ] shows the main observational parameters corresponding to the target and comparison stars as taken from the simbad database operated by cds ( centre de donnes astronomique de strasbourg ) .",
    "two comparison stars have been used during the observations depending on the constraints set by the field of view of the ccd s and sizes of the telescopes .",
    "the first one , hd 23605 ( @xmath5 , f5 ) , is a suitable comparison star considering its brightness and spectral type .",
    "however , this star could not be observed neither at teide nor at san pedro martir observatory because it is so bright that at these telescopes the ccd detectors saturated in a few seconds of exposure time . rather at these sites",
    "we observed the comparison star , hd 23653 ( @xmath6 , k0 ) , since its magnitude is similar to that of the target star .",
    "figure  [ fig : field ] shows a typical image of the ccd s field of view ( @xmath7 ) at the 0.50 m telescope of the xing long observatory .",
    "sky flats , dark and bias exposures were taken every night at all sites .",
    "all data were calibrated and reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "aperture photometry was implemented to extract the instrumental magnitudes of the stars .",
    "the differential magnitudes were normalized by subtracting the mean of differential magnitudes for each night . in figure",
    "[ fig : curves ] the entire light curves v650 tau - comp 2 are presented .",
    "this work has received financial support from the unam under grants papiit in108106 and in114309 .",
    "special thanks are given to the technical staff and night assistants of the san pedro mrtir , teide and xing long observatories .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg ( france ) .",
