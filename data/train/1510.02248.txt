    "the observable of interest in this contribution is the spectrum of @xmath0he when it responds to isoscalar monopole excitations .",
    "such a spectrum can be measured by perturbative isoscalar probes , like for example a beam of @xmath1-particles .    at the end of the 60 s inclusive electron scattering experiments  @xcite put in evidence the existence of a narrow peak in the spectrum of @xmath0he .",
    "this was ascribed just to an isoscalar monopole resonant excitation ( 0@xmath2 resonance ) and the transition form factor to this resonant state was measured for different momentum transferred @xmath3 up to 2 @xmath4 .",
    "no measurement of the whole isoscalar monopole spectrum , however , is available for @xmath0he .    in the case of larger systems ,",
    "such spectra have been the object of considerable activity , both from the experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "the isoscalar monopole spectra of these nuclei exhibit visible  bumps  , called isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) .",
    "the interest in these gmr s lies in the attempt to get an extrapolated value for the nuclear matter compressibility , a quantity of great astrophysical interest .",
    "one has to notice that gmr s are visible in experiments at low momentum transfer and that the low energy part of the spectrum gives the main contribution to the compressibility .",
    "of course , since for low @xmath3 the wavelength that probes the target is large the spectrum will show mainly features that involve all constituents and therefore can reveal collective behaviors .",
    "therefore the gmr s have been interpreted as signatures of  breathing modes  .    in an attempt to bridge few- and many - body physics",
    "we think it is interesting to ask the question whether also the measured @xmath5 excited state in @xmath0he might be interpreted as a ",
    "collective  state .",
    "a similar question arose in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the calculated dipole photonuclear cross section of @xmath6he surprisingly exhibited two prominent peaks .",
    "that result suggested a possible collective interpretation : the higher energy peak could have been ascribed to the displacement of the proton sphere against the neutron one ( gamow - teller mode ) , that at lower energy to the displacement of the halo neutrons against a possible @xmath1-core .",
    "the @xmath1-particle is a very compact system , with a similar binding energy per particle as heavier nuclei , and it is often considered the nucleus where few- and many - body methods can be benchmarked . therefore in order to answer the question of the title , we apply to @xmath0he the same criteria as those , present in the many - body literature , used to judge the collectivity of  bumps  in the spectra .",
    "they consist in studying both the moments of the spectrum ( sum rules ) and the transition densities .    for an isoscalar monopole spectrum",
    "@xmath7 the moments and relative sum rules are @xmath8 where @xmath9 for @xmath10 these quantities can in principle be calculated avoiding the knowledge of scattering states for energies in the continuum .",
    "transition densities to specific states @xmath11 are defined as @xmath12    he as a function of the excitation energy relative to threshold , for momentum transfer @xmath13 @xmath4.,width=264 ]    if the @xmath5 state in @xmath0he were an excitation of extremely collective character the strength would have a @xmath14-function character .",
    "therefore the strength of the resonance would exhaust all @xmath15 .",
    "if this excitation were collective only to some degree , the ratio between the strength of the resonance and @xmath16 would give a measure of the _ degree of collectivity_. other sum rules for higher @xmath17 would not be fit for the purpose , since they emphasize too much the spreading of the background strength to higher energy .",
    "moreover , if the @xmath5 state in @xmath0he were an excitation of extremely collective character , described as a breathing mode , the transition density would be zero at a value of @xmath18 equal to the radius of the system",
    ".    in  @xcite the transition form factor to the @xmath5 excitation had been studied using the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method  @xcite using the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics ( eihh ) expansion  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite we have focused on the isoscalar monopole strength distributions @xmath7 for several fixed momentum transfers . there",
    "it has been shown that especially at low momentum transfer ( e.g. q=0.25 @xmath4 ) the isoscalar monopole spectrum is indeed dominated by a single resonant  bump  close to threshold , as it is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . since the lit method has allowed to separate the resonance contribution from the background ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) we show them separately here in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "one can notice how far in energy the background extends , even if it remains very small .",
    "figures 1 and 2 have been obtained with the chiral effective potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , including both 2-body ( at n3lo ) and 3-body ( at n2lo ) contributions .",
    "he as a function of the excitation energy ; lower panel : background contribution magnified by a factor 100 .",
    ", width=264 ]    according to what was stated above , one can measure  the degree of collectivity  of the resonance state , by taking the ratio of the resonance area to the moment @xmath16 . in this case one",
    "obtains 0.53 .",
    "values exceeding 50% are generally considered an indication of a rather strong collectivity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . because of the extension of the background contribution at higher energy the ratio to @xmath19 is much smaller ( 34% ) , and a conclusion about the concentration of strength in the resonance , would be misleading if compared to @xmath7 as in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , which shows a single prominent narrow peak in the spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] one can see the behavior of the transition density as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "if one considers that the potential used in these calculations gives a root mean square radius of 1.46 fm one notices that this does indeed correspond almost to the point where the transition cross section crosses the zero axis , a typical signature of some kind of breathing mode .    .",
    "the arrow indicates the position of the root mean square radius.,width=264 ]    the results shown in figs . 1 - 3 seem to point out that the two criteria that are generally accepted as indications of a collective behavior are fulfilled in the case of the isoscalar monopole excitation of @xmath0he .",
    "on the other hand it is clear that if one observes this system with such a large wavelength one is likely to observe the dynamics of all nucleons together . in this case",
    "it looks as if the resonance state @xmath20 is obtained by a scaling transformation @xmath21}|0\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is proportional to the low-@xmath3 ( long wavelength ) limit of @xmath23 .",
    "the transformation in the previous equation acts scaling the positions @xmath24 of all particles into @xmath25 , and therefore also of the hyperradius , namely one of the six _ collective _ coordinates defined by the group @xmath26  @xcite ( breathing ) . in order to further prove that this is the case one could evaluate @xmath27 ( connected to the compressibility ) in terms of the moment @xmath28 , in a similar case as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and compare it to the value obtained integrating the inverse energy weighted strength of fig .",
