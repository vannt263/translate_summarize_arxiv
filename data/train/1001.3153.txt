    "there has been a lot of recent progress in microscopic understanding of m2-branes from chern - simons - matter theories .",
    "see @xcite and an extensive list of references thereof .",
    "much of the work was on the conformal field theories and their ads@xmath5 gravity duals .",
    "it is also interesting to study nonconformal quantum field theories in 3 dimensions for m2-branes .",
    "a simple nonconformal model which has drawn some attention is the @xmath6 @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory with mass - deformation @xcite . from the m - theory perspective , this is the worldvolume theory of @xmath4 parallel m2-branes in @xmath7 with a nonzero 4-form field on two @xmath8 factors of @xmath9 .",
    "this theory compactified on a 2-torus also describes the discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) of type iib strings in the maximally supersymmetric plane wave @xcite .",
    "the mass - deformed theory has many discrete vacua .",
    "the classical vacua preserving supersymmetry were studied in @xcite .",
    "they are interpreted as m5-branes stretched along @xmath10 and polarized into 3-spheres in one of the two @xmath8 parts in @xmath9 @xcite . with 2-torus compactification",
    ", these vacua are dualized to polarized half - bps d3-branes in the plane wave @xcite .    for @xmath11 , m2-branes in @xmath9 show enhanced @xmath12 supersymmetry . in this case ,",
    "the supersymmetric vacua have been extensively studied from the gravity side , relying on the constraints from @xmath13 supersymmetries @xcite .",
    "these half - bps geometries are governed by fermion droplets on a cylinder , with a boundary condition that one end of the cylinder is filled . by a semi - classical quantization ,",
    "one obtains the partition function of supersymmetric vacua .",
    "the result @xmath14 for @xmath11 is given by partitions of @xmath4 , whose generating function is @xmath15 the same quantity can be obtained from the gauge theory dual of type iib strings in the dlcq plane wave @xcite . the result ( [ partition ] ) is expected to be correct for both uncompactified m2-branes and those on @xmath16 .",
    "there are various ways of understanding ( [ partition ] ) .",
    "in particular , from the gravity side , this can be understood as coming from quantizing polarized d3-brane giant gravitons in the type iib plane wave background after @xmath16 compactification . from the classical probe brane perspective , branes expanded in two @xmath8 yield two classes of solutions : one class called ` giant graviton ' and another ` dual giant graviton ' @xcite .",
    "the prescription of getting the correct result ( [ partition ] ) , sometimes called ` giant graviton complementarity , ' states that the true quantum degeneracy of half - bps states ( [ partition ] ) is given by ( naively ) quantizing either giant gravitons or dual giant gravitons , but not both .",
    "this notion is generalized to various @xmath17-bps sectors @xcite .",
    "curiously , the classical vacua in the mass - deformed @xmath0 chern - simons theory are similar to the classical polarized brane solutions , in that there are two possible @xmath8 in @xmath9 in which the scalar fields can be turned on @xcite .",
    "see section 2",
    ". the degeneracy of quantum vacua should be compatible with the result obtained from the complementarity prescription , which now has to be derived microscopically from quantum field theory .    in this paper , we count the quantum supersymmetric vacua of this theory for general @xmath2 . since the strongly interacting regime , say @xmath11 ,",
    "is included , we are naturally led to study the witten index for these vacua , counting the number of bosonic vacua minus that of fermionic ones . at least for @xmath11 ,",
    "the gravity states are all bosonic so that the partition function ( [ partition ] ) should be equal to the index .    to compute the index",
    ", it turns out to be possible ( and helpful ) to deform the chern - simons - matter theory by turning on yang - mills kinetic terms for the gauge fields .",
    "we introduce such a deformation preserving an @xmath18 part of the full supersymmetry .",
    "following @xcite , we also compactify this theory on a small 2-torus to reduce our study to a mechanical index .",
    "a crucial part of our analysis will come from the quantum dynamics of @xmath18 yang - mills chern - simons theory with the gauge group unbroken by a classical supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "indices for such theories are computed in @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "yang - mills theory might be physically more natural , considering the origin of m2-brane theories from @xmath19 d - brane systems",
    ". the resulting index would be the same : technically , this is because @xmath18 and @xmath20 yang - mills chern - simons theories have same index @xcite . ] strictly speaking , we are considering the vacua on @xmath16 , or half - bps states in the dlcq plane wave .",
    "however , from various indirect field theory arguments in @xcite as well as successful applications of yang - mills chern - simons index on @xmath16 to d - branes living on uncompactified @xmath10 @xcite , we believe that our calculation also provides the vacuum counting for m2-branes living on @xmath10 .",
    "our main result is the index @xmath21 of supersymmetric vacua for general @xmath2 ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 for @xmath24 , the second factor of restricted infinite sum reduces to @xmath3 , so that the gravity result ( [ partition ] ) is immediately reproduced .",
    "see section 3 for its derivation .",
    "an important reason enabling this perfect agreement , reducing apparent richness of classical vacua , is the dynamical supersymmetry breaking of yang - mills chern - simons theory @xcite when the unbroken gauge group is large compared to the chern - simons level @xmath2 .",
    "see section 3 for the details .",
    "our results for @xmath25 do not seem to be well understood in the gravity dual .",
    "in any case , since we started from @xmath7 , the resulting geometry can not be completely smooth .",
    "for instance , we find the following expressions for some low values of @xmath2 , @xmath26\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after massaging the infinite sum in ( [ higher - partition ] ) .",
    "there is always a factor like ( [ partition ] ) .",
    "all other infinite products appearing in the numerator allude to contribution from additional degrees .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if these can be understood from the gravity dual .",
    "for example , since the case with @xmath27 also preserves @xmath13 supersymmetry , the local structure of the gravity solutions should be the same as @xcite .",
    "it seems to us that a factor of @xmath28 appearing in the half - bps solution should be modded out by a @xmath29 in the following way . near a boundary of black and white regions in the droplet ,",
    "one locally encounters the appearance of @xmath9 for @xmath11 , by combining @xmath28 with two radial directions .",
    "the @xmath29 we mentioned above should replace this by @xmath30 for @xmath27 . even for general @xmath2 with @xmath0 supersymmetry",
    ", it might be that the relevant gravity solutions come with @xmath31 modding of the half - bps solutions .",
    "the common appearance of the factor ( [ partition ] ) in ( [ higher - partition ] ) seems to imply that the cases with @xmath32 share some common features with the case with @xmath11 .    for @xmath11",
    ", we also provide a concrete 1 to 1 map between the supersymmetric vacua and the gravity solutions in @xcite .",
    "based on this map , one would be able to pick a supersymmetric vacua whose gravity dual has small curvature and consider interesting holographic calculations .",
    "we leave such studies to the future .",
    "a motivation for previous studies of mass - deformed chern - simons - matter theories was to find a microscopic realization of non - relativistic holography @xcite with the so - called schrdinger symmetry . in @xcite ,",
    "non - relativistic superconformal theories were constructed starting from the classical vacuum in which no scalar fields are turned on ( i.e. no polarization ) .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "in our study , this vacuum dynamically breaks supersymmetry unless @xmath33 .",
    "this could be signaling that the holography with super - schrdinger symmetry obtained from this model would be highly ` stringy ' from the gravity side , in that the t hooft coupling @xmath34 is small .",
    "see also @xcite for similar discussions .",
    "there have also been studies of supersymmetric gravity solutions with schrdinger symmetry .",
    "it was observed that solutions with @xmath35 or more supersymmetries , needed for the non - relativistic superconformal theory obtained from mass - deformed @xmath0 chern - simons theory , are not allowed @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a study of enhanced supersymmetry in different class of solutions with schrdinger invariance . from our field theory study , it may perhaps be interesting to study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking from the gravity side @xcite .    the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the mass - deformed @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory and explain its classical supersymmetric vacua .",
    "we explain them in the @xmath18 formulation .",
    "we also add yang - mills term preserving this amount of supersymmetry , and also discuss the order and signs of masses for fluctuations around various vacua .",
    "in section 3 we put this theory on a small 2-torus , explain the known result on yang - mills chern - simons index and finally derive our result .",
    "we also explain the map between our supersymmetric vacua and the fermion droplets of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory consists of two @xmath36 gauge fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 , four complex scalars @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) in bifundamental representation of @xmath42 , and four complex fermions @xmath43 which are superpartners of the scalars .",

    "] it is believed that the vanishing of the index for @xmath180 implies dynamical supersymmetry breaking . combining the results for different gauge groups , one obtains @xmath181    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}|k|\\\\ \\sum(n_n\\!-\\!\\hat{n}_n)\\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] for each classical vacuum parametrized by @xmath182 , satisfying ( [ labeled - partition ] ) and ( [ empty - row ] ) .",
    "let us compute the generating function @xmath183 for the index @xmath21 , introducing a chemical potential @xmath184 . to conveniently keep track of the condition ( [ empty - row ] ) later",

    "now one finds that the summations over @xmath68 and @xmath69 all factorize : after using the binomial expansion formula , one obtains the following simple expression @xmath199^{|k|}\\ .\\ ] ] the quantity appearing in @xmath200^{|k|}$ ] can be simplified using the jacobi s triple product identity , in the form which is useful in studying bosonization of 2 dimensional qft @xcite : @xmath201 using this , one obtains the index @xmath202^{|k|}=\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(1-q^n)^{|k|}}\\ \\sum_{\\substack{n_1,n_2,\\cdots , n_{|k|}=-\\infty\\\\(n_1+n_2+\\cdots+n_{|k|}=0)}}^\\infty q^{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(n_1 ^ 2+n_2 ^ 2+\\cdots+n_{|k|}^2\\right)}\\ , \\ ] ] which is the asserted expression ( [ general - partition ] ) .    as explained in the introduction",
    ", this expression immediately reproduces the partitions of @xmath4 for @xmath11 , perfectly agreeing with the expectation from the gravity dual .",
    "the underlying structure can be understood formally from bosonization . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the unbroken gauge symmetry of supersymmetric vacua should be no larger than @xmath203 , since @xmath142 @xmath18 yang - mills chern - simons theory at level @xmath2 admits supersymmetric vacua only for @xmath177 .",
    "so all the occupation numbers @xmath68 and @xmath69 effectively behave like those for ` fermions , ' taking @xmath204 or @xmath3 . now",
    "the partition function for the supersymmetric vacua is like the contribution from two chiral fermions in 2 dimension .",
    "the jacobi s identity that we used is nothing but an equality of 1-loop partition function of 2 chiral fermions and that of a chiral boson @xcite .",
    "one can see more explicitly that the above fermions are nothing but the fermions appearing in the half bps gravity solutions of @xcite . to clearly see this ,",
    "let us rename the @xmath69 occupation numbers as follows : define @xmath205 for @xmath206 , i.e. @xmath55 in @xmath207 denotes the number of rows of the block of second type .",
    "@xmath207 for @xmath206 are what we considered before .",
    "we also introduce @xmath208 , which is now the number of empty rows . from the discussions before ( [ empty - row ] ) , we find that @xmath209 .",
    "we can parametrize our supersymmetric vacua by two sets of fermionic occupation numbers @xmath210 ( with @xmath211 ) satisfying @xmath212 this is nothing but the condition in @xcite that the ` @xmath203 charge ' is set to zero , namely the fermi level of the droplet should be such that we have equal number of particles and holes .",
    "having @xmath213 corresponds to exciting a droplet of unit area in @xcite whose height is @xmath96 from the fermi level , while @xmath214 corresponds to having an empty area ( white region ) with depth @xmath96 beneath the fermi level . in this fashion , we can concretely map each supersymmetric vacuum to the corresponding gravity solution .",
    "in particular , we can say which vacua have gravity duals with small curvatures ( in which case we can do reliable gravity calculations ) . it should be interesting to consider such vacua and study them holographically , like @xcite , for instance .    for @xmath27 , the infinite sum in ( [ jacobi ] )",
    "is given by @xmath215 which yields the expression for @xmath216 in ( [ higher - partition ] ) .",
    "for @xmath217 , one enouncters @xmath218 we first consider the summation over @xmath55 , with @xmath219 fixed . for",
    "even @xmath219 , one uses ( [ jacobi-2nd ] ) : further summation over even @xmath219 can be changed into infinite product using the same formula , replacing @xmath184 by @xmath220 . for odd @xmath219 ,",
    "the summation over @xmath55 is @xmath221 which is obtained by inserting @xmath222 in ( [ jacobi ] ) . collecting all",
    ", one obtains the expression for @xmath223 in ( [ higher - partition ] ) .",
    "it is not clear to us which expression will be more physically suggestive between the infinite sum in ( [ sum - k3 ] ) or the product form ( [ higher - partition ] ) , but the product form makes it clear that one factor of ( [ partition ] ) appears for @xmath32 . similar rearrangement can be made for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also comment on the totally symmetric vacuum , where all scalars @xmath224 are zero . after integrating out the massive matter fields",
    ", we have to consider an @xmath18 yang - mills chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath42 at levels @xmath2 and @xmath225 .",
    "since the index for this theory is zero for @xmath226 , it is likely that the supersymmetry of this vacuum is spontaneously broken .",
    "this implies that the classical analysis of nonrelativistic superconformal chern - simons theory @xcite based on this vacuum should acquire serious non - perturbative correction for @xmath227 , at least as long as the symmetry of the vacuum is concerned .",
