    "the newtonian , lagrangian , or hamiltonian microscopic motion equations , @xmath0 even when embellished with thermostats , ergostats , or barostats , are typically time - reversible@xcite .",
    "the st@xmath1rmer - verlet time - symmetric `` leapfrog algorithm '' : @xmath2 which can be iterated either forward or backward once the coordinates are given at two successive times , is the most transparent example of time reversibility .",
    "likewise the schrdinger equation and maxwell s electromagnetic field equations can be used to generate movies which obey exactly the same equations whether projected in the `` forward '' or the `` backward '' direction of time .",
    "mathematicians have considered more general definitions of time reversibility@xcite , but in some cases these generalizations would include the damped oscillator among the class of reversible systems@xcite , which we believe is nt sensible .",
    "the langevin equation , @xmath3 where both the drag coefficient @xmath4 and the random force @xmath5 are nt time - reversible , is often used in molecular simulations@xcite . in order to make it possible to extend stochastic solutions both forward and backward in time , and to simplify the reproducibility of numerical results by others we think it is desirable to incorporate time - reversible random number generators in our otherwise deterministic algorithms .",
    "the following section illustrates this idea with a simple example algorithm , too simple for serious use in simulation .",
    "the final section of version 1 challenged the reader to find a time - reversed version of a useful algorithm , with a reward for being `` first '' with that specific algorithm . in this version",
    "we include the successful algorithm found by federico ricci - tersenghi _ within a day _ of the challenge s publication .",
    "the design of reversible random number algorithms can be illuminated by the study of time - reversible maps . kum and hoover@xcite considered two - dimensional maps which are time - reversible in the physicist s sense : @xmath6 they pointed out that simple shears , with @xmath7 or @xmath8 , as well as certain phase - space reflection operations , are time - reversible and can be combined with periodic boundary conditions so that the points @xmath9 remain within the unit square . in addition , if @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are time - reversible maps then symmetric combinations of them , like @xmath13 , are likewise time - reversible .",
    "the simple @xmath14 and @xmath15 shears very closely resemble typical algorithms for pseudorandom numbers , such as the fortran example function : +     function rund(intx , inty ) + i = 1029*intx + 1731 + j = i + 1029*inty + 507*intx - 1731 + intx",
    "= mod(i,2048 ) + j = j + ( i - intx)/2048 + inty = mod(j,2048 ) + rund = ( intx + 2048*inty)/4194304.0 + return + end +    this generator returns a periodic sequence of @xmath16 pseudorandom numbers , updating the two seed variables intx and inty as it goes .",
    "the least significant 11 binary digits of rund s numerator can be generated by the simpler function : +     function next(it ) + next = mod(1029*it + 1731,2048 ) + return + end +    the figure at the bottom of this page is a plot of the 2048 iterates of next , ordered according to the index it .",
    "the first six entries are the pairs @xmath17 the single - valued plot of these forward iterates gives the ( misleading ) impression of _ continuous _ lines with a slope ( from either the odd or the even entries ) of ( 5/1 ) , while the actual function is _ discontinuous _ between successive entries due to the jumpy nature of the mod function . reflecting the plot",
    ", @xmath18 illustrates the output of the time - reversed algorithm last . because the equations are _ linear _ it is relatively easy to find the analytic form of the reversed function : +     function last(j ) + last = mod(205*j + 1497,2048 ) + return + end +    the last function , likewise plotted in the figure , is also single - valued . it",
    "_ appears _ to generate ten separate lines .",
    "the values of last for 1 @xmath19 j @xmath19 11 are just enough to indicate how this function resembles ten continuous lines : @xmath20 @xmath21 comparing the first and last entries shows that the apparent slope of the less - steep `` lines '' is @xmath22 .",
    "the reversed arrays of points have an apparent slope of ( 1/5 ) because increasing j by 10 is _ usually _ required in order to increase last by 2 .",
    "these two functions next and last go forward and backward , taking in the result of the most recent iteration , in the range @xmath23 $ ] , as the abscissa and returning , as the ordinate , either the next or the most recent integer .",
    "we viewed a simple , explicit time - reversible pair of generators analogous to next and last above as desirable for stochastic computer simulations .",
    "we have happily rewarded the first successful fortran algorithm generating the two - argument reversal of rund(intx , inty ) above with a cash prize of 500 united states dollars , awarded to federico ricci - tersenghi . as was required , his solution was demonstrated to work for the initial seeds intx = inty = 0 . here is a program based on his solution :     program federico + parameter ( items = 4194304 ) + implicit integer(a - z ) + dimension forwx(items),forwy(items),backx(items),backy(items ) + intx = 0 + inty = 0 + do n = 1,items + i = 1029*intx + 1731 + j = i + 1029*inty + 507*intx - 1731 + intx",
    "= mod(i,2048 ) + j = j + ( i - intx)/2048 + inty = mod(j,2048 ) + forwx(n ) = intx + forwy(n ) = inty + end do + intx = 0 + inty = 0 + do n = 1,items + oldx = mod(205*intx + 1497,2048 ) + inty = inty + items - 1536*oldx - ( 1029*oldx + 1731 - intx)/2048 + inty = mod(205*inty,2048 ) + intx = oldx + backx(n ) = intx + backy(n ) = inty + enddo + stop + end +    the seed variables forward and backward can be verified to satisfy the identities : @xmath24",
    "we are particularly grateful to the late ian snook and our colleague niels gr@xmath1nbech - jensen for calling the importance of stochastic algorithms to our attention , to nathan hoover for pointing out the disallowed storage shortcut , and to carl dettmann for pointing out to us that the damped harmonic oscillator _ is _ time - reversible in the sense put forward in reference 2 .",
    "we specially thank professor ricci - tersenghi for his prompt solution of our challenge .",
    "in 2014 we intend again to offer an ian snook memorial challenge prize for solving an interesting problem relevant to computational statistical mechanics .",
    "suggestions welcome !"
