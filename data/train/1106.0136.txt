    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and a characteristic feature of plants known as the red edge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will play a key role in searching for life on habitable planet candidates .",
    "it will also be important to understand the environment of the planetary surface , in other words , the habitat of the planet .",
    "indeed , diverse surface environments on the earth including continents , ocean , and meteorological condition serve as the backbone of biodiversity . one of the promising approaches to know the landscape of the terrestrial exoplanets is to identify surface components using the scattered light of the planets through the direct imaging observations . in this field , the earth itself has been considered as a useful test - bed for future investigations for extrasolar terrestrial exoplanets .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the cloud distribution and inhomogeneous surface of the earth generate photometric variability of scattered lights due to spin rotation .",
    "thereafter , several authors attempted light curve inversion to characterize surface types @xcite .",
    "one concern with the diurnal inversion is separation of clouds and other surface components since clouds can have an enormous contribution to total reflection light ( @xmath1 70 % in energy for the earth ) .",
    "the diurnal mapping with the single - band photometry is significantly polluted by the cloud reflection @xcite .",
    "diurnal inversion techniques with multiband photometry have been proposed to separate surface types , through the pca analysis with 7 bands @xcite and the albedo modeling with 5 bands @xcite .",
    "the surface area facing on the observer and illuminated by the host star changes according to spin rotation and orbital revolution in different ways .",
    "we demonstrated that the two - dimensional mapping using the diurnal and annual multi - band photometric variations is possible for a cloud - free earth under the assumption of the albedo model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kf10 ) . for the inversion with the diurnal and annual light curves ,",
    "the cloud signal could be serious because seasonal variation of clouds is larger than diurnal variation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we improve our previous method of the two - dimensional mapping to be applicable to a cloudy planet by using a single band or a few bands without any assumptions of albedo models .",
    "this problem is basically ill - posed and needs inversion technique used in the field of tomography .",
    "hence we name this mapping method `` spin - orbit tomography '' .",
    "we test this method by applying to light curves of a mock cloudy earth - twin based on real satellite data .",
    "another virtue of the two - dimensional mapping is the planetary obliquity measurement as discussed in kf10 for the cloud - free case .",
    "the obliquity is one of the few observables that have potential to constrain the formation scenario of the terrestrial planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also discuss the obliquity measurement for a cloudy planet .",
    "in general , scattered lights from the planetary surface are characterized by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) , which is a function of three angles among the incident ray , the line of sight , and the normal direction of surface .",
    "our inversion assumes the lambert ( isotropic ) reflection to approximate real brdfs of the surface . on this approximation ,",
    "the intensity of the scattered light is expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the planetary radius , @xmath4 is the incident flux of photometric band @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the albedo of band @xmath5 at the planetary colatitude @xmath7 and longitude @xmath8 . in this paper",
    ", we only consider a face - on circular orbit since the anisotropic scattering does not affect the phase curve .",
    "figure [ fig : geo ] displays the schematic configuration of the system .",
    "we denote the spin motion by the angle between ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) and the direction of equinox , @xmath11 and orbital revolution by the ecliptic longitude of the host star , @xmath12 measured from the direction of equinox .",

    "we use the light curve normalized by @xmath4 , @xmath30 . in reality",
    ", @xmath31 can be estimated from the orbital distance of the planet , the observed host star flux , and the distance between the system and the earth .",

    "we search for the best - fit @xmath35 and @xmath15 by the nelder - mead method for different @xmath68 .",
    "finally , the regularization parameter @xmath69 is determined by the l - curve criterion , which is the maximum curvature point of the model norm @xmath70 versus residuals @xmath71 plot @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate the spin - orbit tomography by applying it to simulated light curves of an earth - twin .",
    "the light curves were computed with a line - by - line radiative transfer code rstar6b @xcite in combination with empirical data of monthly land reflectivity , monthly snow cover fraction , and daily cloud distribution in 2008 which are provided by terra / modis @xcite .",
    "the effect of multi - scattering , molecular lines , and the anisotropy of the scattering are included by rstar6b .",
    "we put cloud layers made of pure liquid water at an altitude of 4 - 6 km .",
    "we note that the different altitude assumptions ( 0 - 3 and 7 - 20 km ) do not change the reflectivity of clouds in the three bands significantly ( @xmath725 % ) .",
    "the cloud property is specified by two parameters , cover fraction and optical thickness .",
    "the reflection by ocean is modeled by the fresnel reflection of a wavy ocean @xcite .",
    "the detailed description is found in @xcite .        ]    in this paper we focus on photometric variability in three bands : @xmath73 nir ( 0.8 - 0.9 @xmath74 m ) , orange ( 0.6 - 0.7@xmath74 m ) , and blue ( 0.4 - 0.5@xmath74 m ) since these bands have large differences for soil and vegetations .",
    "these bands correspond to three of the bands of the epoxi mission , which was used for validation of the simulation @xcite . for demonstration purpose , we assume a face - on circular orbit and adopt @xmath75 , which is the best geometry for a face - on orbit ( kf10 ) .",
    "though this is not the case for general inclination , we postpone this problem until a forthcoming paper .",
    "we computed the synthetic scattered light of the earth for 30 epochs per day ( in 0.8 hour interval ) over 366 days and stacked them for 6 days ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "since the spin rotational period can be measured through periodogram analysis @xcite , we assume that the @xmath77 is known as well as @xmath17 .",
    "the gaussian noise is imposed so as to mimic the observation with signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath78 for each bin during @xmath79 hours , corresponding to a one year observation of an earth twin at a distance of 10 pc with a 4 m telescope and a hypothetical detector ( kf10 ) .",
    "we estimate observational noises assuming a future mission with the occulter system , such as _ the occulting ozone observatory _",
    "( o3 ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , including the exzodiacal light ( 23 @xmath80 ) , dark noise ( @xmath81 ) , read noise ( 2 @xmath82 ) , quantum efficiency ( 0.91 ) , and end - to - end efficiency ( 0.5 ) with the parameters used in kf10 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while the starlight suppression ratio is difficult to discuss in general , a typical suppression ratio of an occulter is below @xmath83 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even @xmath84 for o3 @xcite .",
    "other noises we assume are comparable to planet s reflection , which corresponds to a @xmath83 order of magnitude of the starlight .",
    "therefore we simply ignore the star suppression noise .",
    "figure [ fig : sp ] a shows the resultant light curves of the blue band for @xmath85 .",
    "we perform the inversion of the light curve for each band . while we take @xmath35 and @xmath15 as fitting parameters , the estimated values from the single - band photometry",
    "is systematically biased a listed in table [ tab : ob ] ( blue ) .",
    "this is likely due to the anisotropic scattering and variation of clouds .",
    "hence we fix @xmath35 and @xmath15 to the input values in figure [ fig : sp ]",
    ". we will discuss about the obliquity determination later .",
    "figure [ fig : sp ] b - d displays the recovered maps of the blue ( panel b ) , orange ( c ) , and nir ( d ) bands . the recovered maps in all bands exhibit a primary feature of high ( low ) reflectivity at high ( low ) latitude . comparing with the annual mean of the cloud optical depth ( fig . [ [ fig : sp ] ] e )",
    ", one can interpret the primary feature as the mean cloud distribution .",
    "while the spatial resolution of the inversion is too poor to recover the narrow band of persistent clouds seen at the equator , known as the intertropical convergence zone , broad bands of the polar front cloud at high latitude is well recovered in these maps .",
    "while short - time scale variations of clouds in weeks or months make systematic residuals between the prediction and data , as indicated in figure [ fig : sp ] a , these variations do not affect recovered mean features of clouds so much .    cc input & estimated @xmath86 +   + @xmath87 , @xmath88 & @xmath89 , @xmath90 +   + @xmath87 , @xmath88 & @xmath91 , @xmath92 + @xmath93 , @xmath88 & @xmath94 , @xmath95 + @xmath96 , @xmath88 & @xmath97 , @xmath98 + @xmath99 , @xmath88 & @xmath100 , @xmath101 + @xmath102 , @xmath88 & @xmath103 , @xmath104 +   + @xmath87 , @xmath88 & @xmath105 , @xmath106 +   +   +        though a primary feature is dominated by clouds , slight differences of the recovered maps between different bands are due to surface components other than clouds .",
    "figure [ fig : al ] demonstrates several representative examples of the surface reflectivity spectra in 0.4 - 1.0 @xmath107 m .",
    "the reflectivity of soil and vegetation increases as wavelength increases .",
    "this band dependence causes the differences between the recovered maps . due to almost constant reflectivity of clouds ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : al ] ] ) , the cloud signal is suppressed by taking the difference between two bands . applying the spin - orbit tomography to the difference vector @xmath108 ( fig . [ [ fig : dif ] ] a ) , we obtain the nir - blue map as shown in figure [ fig : dif ] b. the contrast standing out in the nir - blue map traces the approximate continental distribution of the earth .",
    "the nir - blue map hardly exhibits features at the north america continent and northern part of the eurasian continent due to the large cloud coverage ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : sp ] ] ) and almost constant reflectivity of snow ( fig . [",
    "[ fig : al ] ] ) .",
    "the reason of negative value on the oceans is that rayleigh scattering dominates the reflectivity .",
    "the estimated @xmath35 and @xmath15 agree well with the input value in this case because the variation and the anisotropic effect of clouds are suppressed .",
    "we also perform the inversion for different obliquities listed in table [ tab : ob ] .",
    "the errors of @xmath35 and @xmath109 are estimated by the bootstrap resampling .",
    "we find that the inversion of the nir - blue bands can constrain the obliquity , while the estimate of low obliquity tends to be difficult due to less available information and to be slightly biased .",
    "we also solve the inversion of difference of two bands across the red edge , @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : dif ] ] b ) .",
    "the red edge feature has been examined as a potential biomarker by both earth - shine observation @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "compared with the nir - blue map , the nir - orange map ( fig . [ [ fig : dif ] ] d ) displays larger reflectivity near the equator , corresponding to the rain forests in amazon and southeast asia .",
    "inhabited exoplanets are likely to exhibit the localization of photosynthetic organisms because of inhomogeneous insolation and precipitation .",
    "the enhancement of the edge - like signature at regions suited for photosynthesis might support the presence of extraterrestrial plants .",
    "the red edge feature in spatially - unresolved data is generally diminished by contributions of oceans and clouds .",
    "the bar in figure [ fig : dif ] d indicates the maximum , average , and minimum of the reflectivity difference of spatially - unresolved light curve ( @xmath110 ) without noise . since the red edge feature recovered near the tropical regions",
    "is 2 - 3 times larger than the maximum and average of the nir - orange of the light curve , we conclude that the two - dimensional mapping improves the detectability of the red - edge feature .    in this paper",
    ", we have assumed a 4 m telescope , which is smaller than that of other works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , @xcite assumed a 16 m telescope with a coronagraph to achieve 2 % photometry with 1 hour exposures for an earth twin at 10 pc .",
    "considering the shot noise only , we compute the s / n for 1 hour exposures and a 1 m telescope : 0.32 and 0.44 for their and our fiducial ( s / n = 5 % for 4.8 hour exposures ) assumptions . hence , our noise assumption is similar to them .",
    "the main difference in a telescope size requirement comes from that our method uses data in a whole year .",
    "we also assumed the spin rotational period , which is a critical parameter for our method .",
    "@xcite suggested that s / n=20 for 0.5 hour exposures in a 8-week observation is enough to measure @xmath77 by the periodogram analysis , corresponding to @xmath1 3 times larger aperture than ours ( i.e. @xmath1 12 m ) . while a 1 year observation might improve statistics , it is unclear whether the periodogram works in the same manner when one can not ignore the orbital revolution .",
    "hence the feasibility of the spin - orbit tomography in cooperation with the spin rotation measurement is still under consideration and will be discussed in a future work .",
    "using simulated scattered light curves from an earth - twin based on the satellite data , we have demonstrated that surface albedo maps can be recovered from annual and diurnal photometric variations of terrestrial exoplanets partially covered with clouds and in face - on orbits .",
    "we have shown that the inversion of the light curve recovers the approximate cloud distribution .",
    "after reduction of the cloud signal by taking differences between @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) , we have found that the recovered maps trace continental distribution of the earth .",
    "moreover , the obliquity and equinox can be estimated simultaneously with the reflectivity difference mapping .    though we only consider a face - on orbit in this paper , it is essential to extend our technique to general geometry for practical use . especially for low - obliquity planets like the earth , larger area can be recovered in some inclined geometry .",
    "for the extension to general inclination , the effect of anisotropic scattering to the phase curve can not be ignored .",
    "we will include these effects to the spin - orbit tomography and apply it to various geometrical cases including transiting planets , low obliquity planets with proper inclination , and even tidally locked planets in a forthcoming paper ( fujii and kawahara in preparation ) .",
