    "<S> the gap at @xmath0 scales linearly with @xmath98 @xcite , and thus the gap at @xmath3 should also scale linearly with @xmath98 , in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath159 are respectively the intralayer and interlayer ( next-)nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes @xcite . the activation gap for the @xmath2 hall state , @xmath160 should scale linearly with the magnetic field , and with currently estimated strength for various band - parameters @xmath161 mev / t @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar splitting can also be achieved by applying an electric field between the layers@xcite , and so far in an insulating blg @xmath162 hall plateau has only been observed in the presence of perpendicular electric fields@xcite . </S>",
