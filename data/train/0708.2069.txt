    "our paper addresses the magnetoelectric ( me ) effect .",
    "this effect has been established since the 1960 s in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals ( see the reviews by odell @xcite and , more recently , by fiebig @xcite ) .",
    "the me effect , in linear approximation , is described by magnetoelectric susceptibilities or moduli that have been measured by different groups .",
    "it has been a long - standing discussion whether these moduli fulfill a certain condition , as predicted by post in 1962 @xcite .",
    "this condition was dubbed _",
    "post constraint _ by lakhtakia , see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "numerous arguments against the validity of the post constraint were put forward , some of them are mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , e.g .. however , in the end , we must turn to the experiments and their proper evaluation .    following post @xcite ,",
    "we provide here a relativistic invariant formalism of the electrodynamics of moving media .",
    "the violation of the post constraint is measured by a _ pseudoscalar _",
    "modulus , which has not been determined so far .",
    "if this pseudoscalar vanishes , the post constraint is fulfilled , otherwise it is violated .",
    "on the basis of experimental data , we determine this pseudocsalar ( or axion ) piece of the magenetoelectric moduli and find it _ non_-vanishing .",
    "therefore the post constraint can not be uphold as a general valid relation .    however , our paper has also an interdisciplinary purpose .",
    "our result of the non - vanishing pseudoscalar provides a physical structure that also shows up in the theory of electric networks , more exactly in the theory of two ports , as tellegen s gyrator @xcite , in electrical engineering as perfect electromagnetic conductor ( pemc ) @xcite , and in elementary particle physics as the hypothetical axion field @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these interrelationships support each other . since the axion in elementary physics is the only left hypothetical object in this context , our results make also the existence of the axion particle more likely .    in sec.2",
    ", we give a short description of the me effect . in sec.3 , a 4-dimensional electrodynamic framework for moving media",
    "is built up and the electromagnetic constitutive tensor introduced for local and linear media . in sec.4",
    "we discuss dzyaloshinskii s theory @xcite of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 and extract therefrom the mentioned pseudoscalar . in sec.5",
    "we finally determine the pseudoscalar for the first time and discuss some of its properties in sec.6 .",
    "then , in sec.7 , we turn to the interdisciplinary part and discuss the existence of the pseudoscalar for network theory , electrical engineering , and elementary particle physics . in the concluding section , we collect our results .",
    "in classical electrodynamics for a local linear medium , which is at rest in the reference frame considered , the constitutive law reads @xmath5 and @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the electric constant ( permittivity of free space ) and @xmath8 the magnetic constant ( permeability of free space ) , whereas @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the ( relative ) permittivity and permeability , respectively , of the medium under consideration .",
    "furthermore , the admittance of free space is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 as vacuum impedance , and the speed of light @xmath13 .    if an external @xmath14 field in some suitable medium induces an electric excitation @xmath15 and an external @xmath16 field a magnetic excitation @xmath17 , the constitutive law mentioned has to be extended by so - called magnetoelectric pieces , see odell @xcite .",
    "the general _ local _ and _ linear _ constitutive law , if the medium is anisotropic , reads @xmath18 we have to read ( [ deb ] ) and ( [ heb ] ) as tensor equations , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 as dimensionless @xmath23 matrices .",
    "hence we expect 36 permittivity , permeability , and magnetoelectric moduli in general .",
    "the constants @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 are required for dimensional consistency .",
    "the existence of nonvanishing @xmath21 and @xmath22 matrices was foreseen by landau - lifshitz @xcite for certain magnetic crystals and proposed by dzyaloshinskii @xcite specifically for the antiferromagnet cr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "astrov @xcite ( for an electric field ) and rado & folen @xcite ( for a magnetic field ) confirmed this theory experimentally for cr@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals . for reviews ,",
    "see @xcite  there other magnetoelectric crystals are listed , too  and @xcite .",
    "in order to extend the formalism to systems _ moving _ in the reference frame considered , but also in order to recognize the relativistic covariant structures of ( [ deb ] ) and ( [ heb ] ) , we have to go over to a four - dimensional ( 4d ) formalism .",
    "we collect @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the 4d excitation tensor density @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the 4d field strength tensor @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and coordinates @xmath31 , see post @xcite .",
    "then the maxwell equations read @xmath32 with @xmath33 as 4-current .",
    "this is the `` premetric '' form of maxwell s equations .",
    "they are covariant under general coordinate transformations and do not depend on the metric of spacetime , that is , they are valid in this form in special and in general relativity alike .    in order to complete the maxwell equations ( [ max ] ) to a predictive physical system , we have to specify a constitutive law linking @xmath34 to @xmath35 . in vacuum , here now eventually the metric @xmath36 of spacetime enters with signature @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 with @xmath39 . from the covariant components of the metric @xmath36 , its contravariant components @xmath40 can be determined via @xmath41 .    for magnetoelectric media that are local and linear , we assume , following tamm @xcite and post @xcite , the constitutive law @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a _ constitutive tensor density _ of rank 4 and weight @xmath44 , with the dimension @xmath45=1/resistance$ ] .",
    "since both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are antisymmetric in their indices , we have @xmath48 . an antisymmetric pair of indices corresponds , in 4d , to six independent components .",
    "thus , the constitutive tensor can be considered as a @xmath49 matrix with 36 independent components , see ( [ deb ] ) and ( [ heb ] ) .",
    "a @xmath49 matrix can be decomposed in its tracefree symmetric part ( 20 independent components ) , its antisymmetric part ( 15 components ) , and its trace ( 1 component ) . on the level of @xmath43 ,",
    "this _ decomposition _",
    "is reflected in @xcite @xmath50 the third part , the _ axion _ part , is totally antisymmetric and as such proportional to the levi - civita symbol , @xmath51 } = \\widetilde{\\a}\\ , \\widetilde{\\epsilon}^{\\lambda\\nu\\sigma\\kappa}$ ] . here",
    ", the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol is @xmath52 ; we denote pseudotensors with a tilde .",
    "the second part , the _ skewon _ part , is defined according to @xmath53 .",
    "if the constitutive equation can be derived from a lagrangian , which is the case as long as only reversible processes are considered , then @xmath54",
    ". we will assume this condition henceforth .",
    "below , for cr@xmath0o@xmath1 , it will be verified experimentally .",
    "the _ principal _ part @xmath55 has the symmetries @xmath56 and @xmath57}=0 $ ] .",
    "the tensor @xmath43 has now @xmath58 independent components and the constitutive law reads @xmath59 we can express the axion piece @xmath2 directly in the constitutive tensor ( [ dec ] ) . with @xmath54",
    ", we find @xmath60 this 4d pseudoscalar ( or axion piece ) of @xmath43 will be determined for cr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we split ( [ constit7 ] ) into space and time @xcite .",
    "then we recover equations of the form of ( [ deb ] ) and ( [ heb ] ) , but with an exact relativistic meaning ( @xmath61 ) : @xmath62 we have the 6 permittivities @xmath63 , the 6 permeabilities @xmath64 , and the 8 + 1 magnetoelectric pieces @xmath65 ( its trace vanishes , @xmath66 ) and @xmath2 , respectively . equivalent constitutive relations were formulated by serdyukov et al .",
    "@xcite , p.86 , and studied in quite some detail .",
    "it is remarkable , as can be recognized from ( [ constit7 ] ) and ( [ pss1 ] ) , that @xmath2 is a 4d pseudoscalar .",

    "the permittivities parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath72-axis are denoted by @xmath73 , analogously the permeabilities by @xmath74 , and the magnetoelectric moduli by @xmath75 .",
    "note that all these moduli are dimensionless ( in _ all _ systems of units ) .    the theory ( [ dh1 ] ) to ( [ be3 ] ) and also the corresponding measurements were made in the @xmath76 system .",
    "however , in order to get to the manifestly relativistic covariant @xmath77 representation ( [ explicit3]),([explicit4 ] ) , we have to resolve the @xmath76 system with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 and to compare the corresponding coefficients .",

    "this verifies that @xmath54 and confirms dzyaloshinskii s theory ( below the spin - flop phase ) .",

    "the maximum of @xmath68 was found at about 275 @xmath84 : @xmath85 now we can compute from the values of fig.2 the pseudoscalar ( [ axion ] ) .",
    "however , we need additionally the permeabilities @xmath86 and @xmath87 . they have been measured by foner @xcite .",
    "we find at 4.2 @xmath84 , @xmath88 and the maximum value near the nel temperature @xmath89 . since @xmath86 deviates even less from @xmath90 , we have @xmath91",

    "our results are plotted in fig.3 .",

    "the tilde of @xmath96 is missing . ]",
    "does this result imply consequences also for the experimentalist ?",
    "we think so for the following reason : as we saw above , @xmath86 as well as @xmath87 are approximately one .",
    "therefore the magnetoelectric @xmath97 matrix ( [ gamma ] ) becomes @xmath98 the question is now : _ can we find a substance in which _",
    "@xmath99 that is , in which the matrix @xmath65 vanishes _ for all temperatures ? _",
    "this challenge for experimentalists would be interesting in the sense that then one would have a substance in which the _ only _ magnetoelectric piece would be the pseudoscalar ( or axion ) piece @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , this substance would display an _ isotropic magnetoelectric effect .",
    "_    for a theoretician it could be of value if he / she looks for a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath2 of the magnetoelectric effect should have a different physical origin as compared to the @xmath97 part .",
    "thus , it could be helpful for developing microscopic models for the magnetoelectric effect .",
    "unlike the 3d vectors of the electric an the magnetic fields and the 3d tensors of permittivity @xmath100 , of permeability @xmath101 , and of the magnetoelectric moduli @xmath102 , which all depend on the choice of the reference frame and the local coordinates , the value of @xmath2 is always the _ same_. it is invariant under any orientation - preserving transformation of frames and coordinates  and changes sign when the orientation is changed .",
    "if we consider the pseudoscalar @xmath2 alone , then we can take its constitutive law from ( [ explicit3 ] ) and ( [ explicit4 ] ) , @xmath103 or , in 4d , @xmath104 a space reflection @xmath105 as well and a time inversion @xmath106 see janner @xcite and marmo et al .",
    "@xcite , will turn ( [ ax1 ] ) into its negative , @xmath107 this is an expression of the _ pseudo_scalar nature of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is p odd and t odd .",
    "moreover , the energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field , see @xcite , @xmath108 if ( [ ax ] ) is substituted , vanishes : @xmath109 thus , the electromagnetic energy density @xmath110 , the energy - flux density ( poynting flux ) @xmath111 etc .  of the axion piece vanish .",
    "the structure of the constitutive law ( [ ax1 ] ) or ( [ ax ] ) is not unprecedented . in electrical engineering , in the theory linear networks ,",
    "more specifically in the theory of two ports ( or four poles ) , tellegen @xcite came up with the new structure of a _ gyrator _ , which is defined via @xmath112 where @xmath113 are voltages and @xmath114 currents of the ports 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "let us quote from tellegen @xcite , p.189 : `` the ideal gyrator has the property of ` gyrating ' a current into a voltage , and vice versa . the coefficient @xmath115 , which has the dimension of a resistance , we call the gyration resistance",
    "; @xmath116 we call the gyration conductance . ''",
    "the gyrator is a nonreciprocal network element .",
    "if we turn to the electromagnetic field , then because of dimensional reasons the quantities related to the _ currents _ @xmath117 are the excitations @xmath118 and the quantities related to the _ voltages _ @xmath119 the field strengths @xmath120",
    ". then we find straightforwardly the analogous relations @xmath121 if we rename the resistance @xmath115 according to @xmath122 , then ( [ gyrator * ] ) and ( [ ax1 ] ) coincide . without the least doubt",
    ", the gyrator is in the theory of electrical networks what the axion piece is in magnetoelectricity .",
    "the axion piece ` rotates ' the excitations , modulo an admittance , into the field strengths , as the gyrator the currents into voltages .",
    "these analogies or rather isomorphisms carry even further . in 2005 ,",
    "lindell & sihvola @xcite , see also @xcite , introduced the new concept of a _ perfect electromagnetic conductor _",
    "it obeys the constitutive law ( [ ax1 ] ) or ( [ ax ] ) .",
    "the pemc is a generalization of the perfect electric and the perfect magnetic conductor . in this sense",
    ", it is the ` ideal ' electromagnetic conductor that can be hopefully built by means of a suitable _ metamaterial , _ see sihvola @xcite .",
    "continuing with our search for isomorphisms , we turn to axion electrodynamics , see ni @xcite and wilczek @xcite and , for more recent work , itin @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if for vacuum electrodynamics we add to the usual maxwell - lorentz expression specified in ( [ strel ] ) an axion piece patterned after the last term in ( [ constit7 ] ) , then we have the constitutive law for axion electrodynamics , @xmath123    in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 we have @xmath124 .",
    "it is everybody s guess what it could be for the physical vacuum . in elementary particle theory one",
    "adds in the corresponding lagrangian also kinetic terms of the axion  la @xmath125 and possibly a massive term @xmath126 .",
    "this hypothetical @xmath127 odd and @xmath95 odd particle has not been found so far , in spite of considerable experimental efforts , see davis et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the axion shares its @xmath127 odd and @xmath95 odd properties with the @xmath2 piece of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 , with the gyrator , and with the pemc .",
    "one may speculate whether an axion detector made of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals could enhance the probability of finding axions .",
    "our results can be summed up as follows :          @xmath128 since the gyrator and the pemc are established notions in network theory and in electrical engineering , these two notions , together with the isomorphic structure of the pseudoscalar piece in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 , support the existence of a fundamental axion field coupled to conventional vacuum electrodynamics .",
    "thus , axion electrodynamics gains plausibility by our results .    _",
