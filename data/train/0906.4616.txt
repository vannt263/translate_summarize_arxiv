    "solitons have been observed in diverse fields of nonlinear physics , and they share several common fundamental properties relying on a combination of nonlinear response and natural tendency of wave packets to spread as they propagate .",
    "spatial optical solitons  @xcite originate from a balance between linear diffraction and self - focusing in a nonlinear optical medium , and they are self - confined ( non - spreading ) beams , i.e. their size is invariant during propagation .",
    "spatial optical solitons have been investigated extensively in a variety of nonlinear materials , both in one- and two - dimensional geometries ; they have significant potentials towards signal processing , switching and readdressing in future generations of all - optical circuits . in this context , a giant nonlinearity arising from molecular reorientation in nematic liquid crystals ( nlcs ) attracted significant attention  @xcite . both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite results",
    "were demonstrated for spatial solitons in nlcs , also known as _ nematicons _",
    "@xcite .",
    "nematic liquid crystals consist of elongated molecules aligned along a given direction ( molecular director ) owing to both anchoring at the boundaries and intermolecular forces  @xcite .",
    "the resultant medium is positively birefringent uniaxial with ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , defined for polarizations parallel and orthogonal to the director . in general , the properties of nlcs are intermediate between solids and liquids , thus liquid crystals can be found in different phases , featuring different properties and degree of order .",
    "their giant reorientational nonlinearity allows to generate nematicons with relatively low optical powers , at the milliwatt level or below , for the study of the fundamental aspects and applications of light interactions with self - assembling soft matter .    .",

    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite underlined the differences between the short- and long - range interactions of two nematicons : at variance with the short - range phase - sensitive interactions , the long - range attraction dominates in strongly nonlocal media .",
    "several experiments with nematicons were carried out in nlc cells with an applied ( low frequency ) electric field ( voltage ) , which can control the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules and , therefore , their nonlinear as well as nonlocal responses  @xcite , thus affecting the interaction between nematicons .",
    "nematicons can also propagate in unbiased nlc cells  @xcite , as well as in bias - free chiral and twisted nlc cells  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study experimentally the propagation of a single nematicon and the interaction between two nematicons in different layers of a planar un - biased nlc cell in order to assess the role of the boundaries , previously investigated numerically by alberucci _",
    "et al . _",
    "we observe both phase - sensitive interaction of nematicons , similar to the case of local nonlinear media , and suppression of out - of - phase soliton repulsion , a signature of long - range interactions .",
    "the co - existence of two effects pinpoints an intermediate range of nonlocality in bias - free nlcs .",
    "we adopt the cell geometry sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , with two parallel polycarbonate plates separated by a gap , the latter defined by spacers of thickness @xmath4 .",
    "the cell contains the 6chbt liquid crystals  @xcite which has negligible absorption and high nonlinearity with refractive indices @xmath5=1.6718 and @xmath6=1.5225 at room temperature .",
    "the polycarbonate plates have been rubbed in the plane @xmath7 at an angle @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "such boundary conditions entail molecular orientation in bulk analogous to that provided by pre - alignment via an external bias .",
    "however , in contrast to a standard biased nlc cell where the director can rotate orthogonally to the plates in the plane @xmath10 , the optic axis here remains parallel to the rubbed plates and the light for soliton excitation is polarized along the @xmath11 direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . using a @xmath12 microscope - objective , a gaussian beam of power 4.7  mw",
    "is focused onto the cell input facet . a standard",
    "half - wave plate controls the polarization and allows choosing between linear ( ordinary wave ) or nonlinear ( extraordinary wave ) regimes of propagation .",
    "the beam evolution is monitored by collecting the light scattered above the cell ( from the plane @xmath7 ) with an optical microscope , a @xmath13 microscope - objective and a high resolution ccd camera .",
    "the input beam waist is @xmath14 m , i.e. its transverse size is well below the cell thickness .",
    "we keep the total beam power at low values in order to avoid thermooptical effects arising from absorption and heating .     in the cell",
    "relative to the upper plate ; the input beam power is 4.7  mw .",
    "( b ) averaged distance ( solid line ) at which the intensity of the scattered radiation is at its half - maximum ; data points are shown by colored dots in black for a single nematicon , in red for two in - phase and in blue for two out - of - phase nematicons.,width=491 ]    we begin by studying the longitudinal dynamics of a single nematicon versus its position @xmath15 with respect to the cell upper boundary , see fig .  [ fig1](a , media 1 ) . in order to record the beam trajectories in the plane",
    "@xmath10 parallel to the cell plates and to control the vertical position of the soliton in the nlc cell , we use an @xmath16-axis flexure stage and gradually move the cell ( with increments of @xmath17 m ) along @xmath18 from top to bottom . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , self - focusing at the given power is sufficient for beam self - trapping at any position in the cell , confirming the generation of the bias - free nematicons .",
    "however , the visible propagation length of the nematicon changes dramatically with @xmath15 , attaining a maximum in the midplane of the cell .",
    "the reason for this is the different amount of light scattering by various nlc layers , with higher degree of orientational order ( lower scattering ) closer to the boundaries . as apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , in the region @xmath19m@xmath20 m in the cell the `` effective length '' of the nematicon is nearly constant .",

    "[ fig2 ] we also compare the profiles for both the in - phase ( e , media 2 ) and out - of - phase ( f , media 3 ) nematicons versus their position in the cell @xmath15.,width=491 ]    next we consider the interaction of two nematicons in the same cell . in order to generate two identical input beams we use the standard mach - zehnder arrangement , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "the relative phase between the two beams is adjusted by the rotation of a 1.8  mm - thick parallel - face plate ( pp ) and is measured via the interference pattern on a beam profiler after the second beam - splitter . with the half - wave plate we control the polarization state of the two identical parallel gaussian beams of power 2.35  mw each , focused into the cell by a @xmath12 objective .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the experimental results for the interaction between in - phase and out - of - phase nematicons .",
    "the waist of each beam is @xmath14 m and the distance between them is @xmath23 m .",
    "as it was discussed earlier  @xcite , the long - range interaction between solitons is largely independent on their relative phase , similar to the interaction of mutually incoherent solitons  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the phase - dependence in short - range interaction between nematicons  @xcite is reminiscent of those in local nonlinear media  @xcite . on one hand",
    "we observe clear differences between in - phase and out - of - phase interactions , cf .",
    "[ fig2](a , b ) and ( c , d ) ; in particular , in - phase nematicons strongly exchange power and merge in ( a , b ) . on the other hand",
    "out - of - phase nematicons as in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c , d ) remain almost parallel , i.e. the mutual repulsion , expected for interactions in local media , is suppressed by nonlocality .",
    "we conclude that in our experiments an intermediate regime is probed , where the nonlocality is high enough to balance out - of - phase repulsion without completely suppressing the phase - dependent behavior .    to study the role of cell boundaries on nematicon interactions we vary the position @xmath15 of the nematicon pair relative to the cell upper plate .",
    "as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig3](e , media 2 ) for in - phase nematicons , and in fig .",
    "[ fig3](f , media 3 ) for out - of - phase nematicons , there is no qualitative difference in the interaction between nematicons positioned anywhere in the nlc thickness , except for small regions by the boundaries .    position of the focal plane of the input objective lens ( 5.5  mm ) with respect to the input facet ; here @xmath24 is the distance between the objective and the nlc cell .",

    "[ fig4](a , b ) summarize our experimental results on the strength of the coherent interaction between in - phase nematicons versus launch conditions , i.e. input focusing and relative angle between the beams . in both cases",
    "the nematicons are excited in the midplane . by shifting the focal plane of the input microscope - objective within the cell [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](a , media 4 ) ] , we observe a shift of the interaction region along @xmath9 until it seemingly vanishes for @xmath26  mm , i.e. the focal plane in @xmath27  mm .",
    "in other words , an additional focusing reduces the efficiency of the power transfer between nematicons .",
    "we also find a threshold in the angle @xmath25 between the two input beams [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b , media 5 ) ] : below it the interaction results in nematicon coalescence , whereas above it the nematicons practically do not interact .",
    "the threshold is @xmath28 .",
    "we have studied experimentally the generation and phase - sensitive interaction of two nematicons in an unbiased nematic liquid crystal cell . the boundary effects arising from anchoring of the nlc",
    "can be estimated by the reduction of the scattering as the soliton gets closer to the rubbed surface . for cells",
    "@xmath29 m thick , a central region of @xmath30 m in the cell provides an almost constant nonlinear response .",
    "furthermore , we have observed short - range phase - sensitive nematicon interactions along with nonlocality - driven suppression of the repulsion between out - of - phase solitons .",
    "all the results involving the role of finite boundaries and phase - sensitive soliton - soliton interactions encourage the investigation of more complex multi - soliton states . these include boundary - induced motion of nematicons  @xcite as well as intriguing self - induced transformations between higher - order nematicons  @xcite ."
