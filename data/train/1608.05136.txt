    "the surface tension is one of the most vivid properties of a fluid",
    ". theoretical descriptions , which employ methods of homogeneous statistical mechanics , are challenging to use due to lack of symmetry at the phase boundary , where the system is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "the seminal square gradient approximation of van der waals @xcite ( see also @xcite for historical survey ) and more sophisticated approaches @xcite , along with the principle of corresponding state ( pcs ) are the basis for understanding of the universal regularities at the phase coexistence , which are valid for a very broad class of fluids and for a broad region of fluid states , including the vicinity of the critical point @xcite .    two remarkable empirical relations for fluids are known for more than a century .",
    "one of them is the law of rectilinear density diameter ( lrd ) @xcite , which states that if @xmath0 are the densities of corresponding phases along the binodal , and @xmath1 is the temperature , then : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "the other linear relation is the zeno line ( zl ) linearity @xcite , which states that the unit compressibility curve @xmath4 is described by a linear equation : @xmath5 where the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are determined from the expressions for the virial coefficients  @xcite : @xmath8 for the van der waals equation of state zl is fulfilled trivially and is known as the batschinski law @xcite .",
    "recently , the classical pcs has gained a new development by analyzing universality in the behavior of the density binodal rectilinear diameter and the zeno - line linearity @xcite , which are observed in quite versed fluid systems , which span standard molecular liquids , various model fluids with the pair interaction potentials of mie - class , and liquid metals @xcite .",
    "these findings were casted in a simple geometrical picture of the global isomorphism ( gi ) between the fluid and the ising model , where the asymmetric fluid binodal is symmetrized to resemble the symmetric binodal of the ising model @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the concept of the global isomorphism between the states of the lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid and the ising model was elaborated @xcite .",
    "the developed global isomorphism incorporates pcs in a natural way .",
    "indeed , molecular liquids , which show linearity of the rectilinear diameter as well as zeno - line linearity , belong to a single class , which has the property that the fluid part of the phase diagram is topologically isomorphic to the phase diagram of the ising model @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to add to the results of recent work @xcite by considering the consequences of the global isomorphism for the critical amplitudes of the surface tension and the correlation length of the lj fluid as well as the interfacial width .",
    "these relations can be verified in computer simulations .",
    "we use available data to verify some of them .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_zenoiso ]",
    "we outline the main ideas of the global isomorphism between the molecular fluid with the lj type of interaction and the lattice gas . in section  [ sec_st ]",
    "the critical amplitude of the surface tension for the lj fluid is derived and the compared with the results from literature . in section  [ sec_width ]",
    "we discuss the effective interfacial width and its relation to the correlation length .",
    "concluding remarks and discussion of the future ideas are presented in the conclusion section .",
    "consider the lattice gas model , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy of the nearest cite - cite attraction , @xmath12 is the chemical potential , and the repulsive part is modeled by the restriction for the occupation number of a cite @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice gas model is isomorphic to the ising model @xcite with the interaction constant @xmath14 related to the energy of the nearest cite - cite attraction as @xcite @xmath15 .",
    "we will use the names `` ising model '' and `` lattice gas model '' interchangeable , emphasizing the difference , where necessary .",
    "let @xmath16 be the density of the lattice gas and @xmath17 be the temperature of the lattice gas normalized by its critical temperature value @xmath18 .",
    "then the global isomorphism between the ising model ( or , equivalently , the lattice gas model ) and the lj fluid with the density @xmath19 and the temperature @xmath1 is represented by the following projective transformation @xcite : @xmath20 and the corresponding inverse transformation @xmath21 where the parameter @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and the parameters @xmath24 are the ones , which determine the linear zeno - element @xmath25 the temperature @xmath26 is related to the boyle point in van der waals ( vdw ) approximation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the particle diameter .",
    "furthermore , the density @xmath31 represents the high density state @xcite : @xmath32 for the lj fluid we use conventional dimensionless units for the temperature @xmath33 , density @xmath34 .",
    "note , that for the ising model the law of rectilinear diameter is fulfilled trivially because of the spin - flop symmetry . in that case the zeno - line is the line @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the molar fraction of @xmath37 occupied sites on a lattice with total @xmath38 sites .",
    "the interaction potential of the lj fluid is @xmath39 since its attractive part has asymptotic behavior @xmath40 , it is possible to sow that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spatial dimension and 6 is the power the attractive part of the potential @xcite .",
    "the relation between the parameter @xmath43 and the lattice gas interaction parameter @xmath11 in eq .   is independent of the spatial dimension @xcite : @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath45 in two dimensions ( 2d ) and @xmath46 in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite . a simple estimate based on eq",
    ".   leads to the following values of the critical temperatures of the lj fluid : @xmath47 these values are in good agreement with the results of computer simulations @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that linear behavior of the binodal diameter and of the zeno - line have much broader validity than the standard formulation of the pcs based on a simple scaling law of the interaction potentials @xcite . in particular",
    ", the behavior of the surface tension also reveals universal features @xcite and can be understood in the context of the global isomorphism formulation of the pcs .",
    "thus , the zeno - line regularity has been used in the studying the surface tension of molecular liquids @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the relation between thermodynamic potentials of the lattice gas and the lj fluid stated in @xcite . in particular , eq",
    ".   follows from the equality between the grand thermodynamic potential of the lj fluid , @xmath48 , and the one of the isomorphic lattice model , @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pressure and @xmath12 is the chemical potential of the lj fluid , @xmath52 is the fluid volume , while @xmath53 is the field variable conjugated to @xmath54 , @xmath38 is the number of sites in the lattice of the lattice gas",
    ".    the strength of the global isomorphism approach can also be demonstrated by considering the liquid - vapor equilibrium for the 2d lj fluid @xcite on the basis of the onsager s exact solution . before doing that",
    ", we should note that computer simulations do not always agree well with the existing theoretical approaches @xcite.the use of projective transformation to map the binodal of the ising model to the liquid - vapor coexistence curve gives more adequate estimate for the critical point and correctly reproduces the behavior of the binodal near the critical point @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of a small value of the order parameter critical index ( @xmath55 ) and the global character of its power law behavior .",
    "also eq .   along with eq",
    ".   leads to a simple relation between the critical compressibility factors , @xmath56 of the lattice gas ( ising model ) and the lj fluid @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath18 and @xmath58 are the critical temperatures of the lattice gas and the lj fluid respectively . in the 3d case",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 for cubic lattice @xcite and eq .   leads to : @xmath61 this value agree very well with the known values of @xmath62 for the noble fluids , , , or the fluids like , which are usually considered as the canonical examples of the lj fluid .",
    "these results encourage us to apply the global isomorphism relations to the surface tension .",
    "earlier @xcite it was shown how to use the results for the surface tension of the ising model in order to get the surface tension of the molecular fluids in a wide temperature region .",
    "starting from the relation between thermodynamic potentials of the lj fluid and the lattice gas , and taking into account that the linearities , in the bulk phase and in the surface decouple , according to , we establish the correspondence between the surface tensions of the lj fluid and the lattice model : @xmath63 provided that geometrical sizes of the corresponding systems are the same .    in the following analysis",
    "we will use the dimensionless units for the surface tension : @xmath64 , where @xmath14 is the interaction constant of the ising model ( and not the lattice gas model ) and @xmath65 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the surface tension of the lj fluid is measured in corresponding units : @xmath66 , where @xmath43 and @xmath30 are the parameters of the lj potential  .    in the context of the global isomorphism , eq .",
    "allows one to extract the information about the surface tension of the lj fluid on the basis of the information for the corresponding lattice model .",
    "in particular , for the surface tension of the 2d lj fluid on the basis of the onsager",
    "s solution @xcite we have : @xmath67 with @xmath68 another immediate consequence of concerns the critical amplitude @xmath69 of the surface tension : @xmath70 the relation between the critical amplitudes for the surface tension of the corresponding systems is as follows : @xmath71 the factor @xmath72 in eqs .   and",
    "appears due to the definition of the interaction constant of the ising model .",

    ". we can conclude , that application of the global isomorphism to the surface tension of the 2d lj fluid gives much better results than the other theoretical approaches used to analyze the results of the simulations @xcite , since they fail to reproduce both the binodal and the surface tension data .",
