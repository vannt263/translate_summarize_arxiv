    "the first - order duffin - kemmer - petiau ( dkp ) formalism @xcite-@xcite describes spin-0 and spin-1 particles and has been used to analyze relativistic interactions of spin-0 and spin-1 hadrons with nuclei as an alternative to their conventional second - order klein - gordon and proca counterparts .",
    "the onus of equivalence between the formalisms represented an objection to the dkp theory for a long time and only recently it was shown that they yield the same results in the case of minimally coupled vector interactions , on the condition that one correctly interprets the components of the dkp spinor @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the equivalence between the dkp and the proca formalisms has already a precedent @xcite .",
    "the equivalence does not maintain if one considers partially conserved currents @xcite and the dkp formalism proved to be better than the klein - gordon formalism in the analysis of the @xmath0 decays , the decay - rate ratio @xmath1 , and level shifts and widths in pionic atoms @xcite . furthermore , the dkp formalism enjoys a richness of couplings not capable of being expressed in the klein - gordon and proca theories .",
    "a number of different couplings in the dkp formalism , with scalar and vector couplings in analogy with the dirac phenomenology for proton - nucleus scattering , has been employed in the phenomenological treatment of the elastic meson - nucleus scattering at medium energies with a better agreement to the experimental data when compared to the klein - gordon and proca based formalisms @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , the dkp  theory has also experienced a renewed interest due to the discovery of a new conserved vector current now , @xcite-@xcite , whose positive - definite time component would be a candidate to a probability current , and as a bonus a hope for avoiding klein s paradox for bosons @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that the proposed new current is a fiasco as a probability current @xcite .",
    "an effort to disembarrass the status of that new current was done @xcite but in @xcite it was shown to be indefensible . in ref . @xcite",

    "ii we present the general dkp equation , discuss conditions on the interactions which lead to a conserved current and effects of parity , charge - conjugation and time - reversal transformations on the vector lorentz structures . adopting a specific representation for the dkp matrices , we set up the one - dimensional equations for the components of the dkp spinor ( iia for the spin-0 sector and iib for the spin-1 sector ) in the presence of minimal and nonminimal vector interactions .",
    "we point out that the space component of the nonminimal vector potential can not be absorbed into the spinor , as diffused in the literature . beyond that , we show that the space component of the nonminimal vector potential could be irrelevant for the formation of bound states for potentials vanishing at infinity but its presence is a sine qua non condition for confinement . in sec .",
    "iii we specialize to nonminimal vector linear potentials and discuss the solutions of the vector dkp oscillator in detail .",
    "the relevance of the nonminimal vector potential for the confinement of bosons is reinforced .",
    "an apparent paradox related to the localization of bosons in the presence of strong potentials is solved by introducing the concepts of effective mass and effective compton wavelength . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we draw conclusions .",
    "the dkp equation for a free boson is given by @xcite ( with units in which @xmath2)@xmath3where the matrices @xmath4  satisfy the algebra@xmath5and the metric tensor is @xmath6diag@xmath7 . the algebra expressed by ( [ beta ] ) generates a set of 126 independent matrices whose irreducible representations are a trivial representation , a five - dimensional representation describing the spin-0 particles and a ten - dimensional representation associated to spin-1 particles .",
    "the dkp spinor has an excess of components and the theory has to be supplemented by an equation which allows to eliminate the redundant components .",
    "that constraint equation is obtained by multiplying the dkp equation by @xmath8 , namely@xmath9this constraint equation expresses three ( four ) components of the spinor by the other two ( six ) components and their space derivatives in the scalar ( vector ) sector so that the superfluous components disappear and there only remain the physical components of the dkp theory .",
    "the second - order klein - gordon and proca equations are obtained when one selects the spin-0 and spin-1 sectors of the dkp theory .    a well - known conserved four - current",
    "is given by @xmath10where the adjoint spinor @xmath11 is given by@xmath12with@xmath13 in such a way that @xmath14 ( the matrices @xmath4 are hermitian with respect to @xmath15 ) .",
    "the time component of this current is not positive definite but it may be interpreted as a charge density . the factor 1/2 multiplying @xmath16 , of no importance regarding the conservation law , is in order to hand over a charge density conformable to that one used in the klein - gordon theory and its nonrelativistic limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the potential matrix @xmath26 can be written in terms of well - defined lorentz structures .",
    "for the spin-0 sector there are two scalar , two vector and two tensor terms @xcite , whereas for the spin-1 sector there are two scalar , two vector , a pseudoscalar , two pseudovector and eight tensor terms @xcite .",

    "these facts imply that there is no channel for spontaneous boson - antiboson creation and for that reason the single - particle interpretation of the dkp equation is ensured .",
    "the charge conjugation operation allows us to migrate from the spectrum of particles to the spectrum of antiparticles and vice versa just by changing the sign of @xmath42 .",

    "the interesting possibility of a probability current in the dkp theory , constructed from the energy - momentum tensor , launched in @xcite-@xcite , though , received a severe criticism in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it will then be challenging to construct a probability current in the dkp theory from a relativistically invariant positive - definite inner product .",
    "notwithstanding , the conserved charge current plus the charge conjugation operation are enough to infer about the absence of klein s paradox under nonminimal vector interactions , or its possible presence under minimal vector interactions .",
    "we showed that nonminimal vector couplings have been used improperly in the phenomenological description of elastic meson - nucleus scatterings potential by observing that the four - current is not conserved when one uses either the matrix @xmath38 or @xmath39 , even though the linear forms constructed from those matrices behave as true lorentz vectors .",
    "we also pointed out that the space component of the nonminimal vector potential can not be absorbed into the spinor . beyond that",
    ", we showed that the space component of the nonminimal vector potential could be irrelevant for the formation of bound states for potentials vanishing at infinity but its presence is an essential ingredient for confinement .",
    "for the one - dimensional problem , the dkp equation with nonminimal vector potentials was mapped into a sturm - liouville problem in such a way that the solution for linear potentials could be found by solving a schrdinger - like problem for the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "the behavior of the solutions for this sort of dkp oscillator was discussed in detail .",
    "that model reinforced the absence of klein s paradox .",
    "furthermore , due to the fact that there is no room for the boson - antiboson production , a boson embedded in this sort of background acquires an effective mass which permits it can be strictly localized .",
    "we also showed that the dkp oscillator for vector bosons is conditionally solvable .",
    "in addition to provide a better understanding of the dkp theory with a sort of coupling full of phenomenological relevance and not yet well explored in the literature , it was conceived an exactly solvable vector model relating to the confinement of bosons .",
