    "extinction law assumes the dust is in a foreground screen , while the results of frster schreiber et al .",
    "( 2001 ) indicate that modeling the dust and stars as intermixed is a better description of the m82 starburst . in a series of comparisons between the shape of the emergent sed in the case of a foreground screen ( @xmath139 ) and a mixed disribution of sources and absorbers ( @xmath140/\\tau$ ] ) , we find that the eddington ratio might change by a factor of @xmath141 at fixed @xmath96 .    for the source geometry , we model the starburst as a point source in our order of magnitude calculations and our monte carlo simulations .",
    "past @xmath541  kpc from the plane , this is a @xmath545% effect at most , so the uncertainty introduced in @xmath142 is small compared to our other uncertainties .",
    "we also modeled the outer disk of m82 using starburst99 spectra as a 0.5  gyr - old population of @xmath143 ( mayya et al .",
    "2006 ) . even assuming no reddening or extinction between the starburst and the superwind , the outer disk in this model provides @xmath541% of the flux illuminating the wind , and",
    "therefore does not contribute significantly to the eddington ratio .",
    "we also assume that the dust density is constant along the line of sight for a given @xmath11 .",
    "while this can not be strictly true , this assumption does not have a large effect on our calculations .",
    "although equation  [ eq : edd ] does contain @xmath30 through @xmath144 and equation  [ eq : lstar ] , from equation  [ eq : rad ] we see that the observed flux of scattered light depends on the observed dust column , which is taken from roussel et al .",
    "thus , the main factor that will change given @xmath145 is @xmath65 .",
    "we do not expect this change in @xmath65 to heavily affect our results .",
    "in addition to the extraction aperture through the galex data we describe in this paper ( figure  [ fig : m82im ] ) , we also examined two other extraction apertures through the wind , one centered a few tens of arcseconds northeast of our first one , and another centered a few tens of arcseconds southwest .",
    "we found that there was no difference in the overall conclusions ; neither the dust densities nor the uv fluxes varied by more than a factor of two .",
    "only the detailed shapes of the distributions changed .",
    "our results indicate that even though the escaping uv luminosity is high compared to previous observations ( hoopes et al .",
    "2005 ) , the overall escape fraction of uv light is only @xmath146 . given that the dust opacity continues to rise towards the lyman edge ( draine  2003b ) , it follows that there must be a low escape fraction of ionizing photons , likely less than @xmath147 .",
    "this is consistent with results obtained by several other groups ( see , e.g. , heckman et al .  2001 , bergvall et al .",
    "2006 , grimes et al .",
    "2009 , heckman et al .",
    "2011 , leitherer et al .",
    "heckman et al .  ( 2001 ) found that galactic winds do not necessarily clear paths through the ism for ionizing radiation to escape .",
    "it does not appear that m82 s superwind has cleared such a path .    in this work ,",
    "we generally treated the dust and gas as separate , except when we calculated the final eddington ratio using equation  [ eq : edd ] . ignoring magnetic fields and grain charging , which enhance dust - gas coupling , the scale over which grains of size @xmath103 are hydrodynamically coupled to the gas is ( draine & salpeter  1979 , murray et al .",
    "2005 ) @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 is the gas number density , and @xmath151 is the individual grain density . as shown by figure  [ fig : dust ] , typical gas densities in the wind are @xmath152 , assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , our model geometries for the dust density , and the roussel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) data .",
    "thus , @xmath153 ranges from @xmath154 for @xmath155 grains , and @xmath156 for smaller grains .",
    "this means that the dust and gas are likely hydrodynamically coupled in the wind on large scales , and that the wind is sub - eddington ( @xmath157 for @xmath158  kpc ) .",
    "although our work indicates that the m82 superwind is sub - eddington on large scales , there is still the question of whether it is super - eddington on small scales ( @xmath159kpc ) . if an mrn dust model and the rest of our assumptions ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) are valid inside the region where we have dust density data from roussel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , then we can extend the eddington ratio calculation inwards , given a determination of the enclosed dynamical mass .",
    "the rotation curve of gmt12 implies @xmath160m@xmath161 , but on these small scales their calculation is affected by the stellar bar in m82 .",
    "frster schreiber et al .  ( 2001 ) estimate @xmath162m@xmath161 from molecular and ionized gas tracers , similar , but somewhat higher than a naive application of gmt12 . given these uncertainties",
    ", we estimate that for @xmath163 @xmath164 where there are factor of @xmath165 uncertainties in both @xmath16 and @xmath166 .",
    "the dashed curve in figure [ fig : edd ] shows an explicit calculation of @xmath0 on small scales assuming the gmt12 mass estimate and @xmath94ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "note that using the value of @xmath167ergs s@xmath3 ( near the maximum in figure [ fig : lstar ] ) increases the dashed curve in figure [ fig : edd ] by a factor of 3 at equivalent @xmath168 .",
    "thus , this comparison indicates that the m82 superwind is currently sub - eddington on @xmath169kpc scales .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the superwind was super - eddington in the past when the starburst was younger and brighter .",
    "the models of frster schreiber et al .",
    "( 2003 ) indicate that the luminosity of the starburst was higher by about a factor of four roughly 6  myr ago , for a bolometric luminosity of @xmath170 . assuming a similar dust and gas distribution to today s results in @xmath171 on large scales and @xmath172 on smaller scales . however , if the gas surface density within the starburst was higher at that earlier time , this would lower the flux - mean opacity in the outflow , decreasing @xmath0 throughout the wind .",
    "finally , we consider the current eddington limit for the dusty gas within the starburst itself . in this case , the appropriate eddington limit is the single - scattering limit discussed in murray et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , thompson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and andrews & thompson ( 2011 ) . if all of the radiation is absorbed or scattered once , then the single - scattering eddington flux is @xmath173 for a thin disk , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the stellar and gas surface densities . scaling to parameters appropriate to m82 s nucleus , @xmath176 ,",
    "is prima facie inconsistent with @xmath177 for the obscuring screen used to model the emergent sed in section [ sec : results ] , since this uv optical depth would imply @xmath178@xmath179 g@xmath3 of gas .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec : error ] a mixed medium of sources and obscuration is more realistic , and implies @xmath180 , which is consistent with @xmath181 . ] where @xmath182 is the gas fraction , whereas the observed fir flux of m82 is @xmath183 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "it remains plausible that m82 s nuclear starbust region currently exceeds the single - scattering eddington limit , and may have significantly exceeded it 6  myr ago , but clearly further work is required .",
    "lastly , we note that many of the super star clusters in m82 exceed the single - scattering eddington limit ( krumholz & matzner 2009 ; murray et al .  2010 ; murray et al .",
    "2011 ) , and may thus be in part responsible for injecting gas into the hot outflow , or directly accelerating the gas to high velocities ( murray et al .  2011 ; but , see krumholz & thompson 2013 ) .",
    "we estimate the eddington ratio for the dusty gas along the minor axis in the m82 superwind . we constrain the dust density distribution using herschel spire data and the dust mass map provided by roussel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and we use monte carlo simulations to verify the applicability of the mrn dust distribution and both of our model geometries in our calculations by comparing the simulation results with archival galex images of m82 . we find that the combined uv luminosity in the galex bands that illuminates the superwind of m82 is @xmath184 times higher than that found by hoopes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from our line of sight .",
    "we find that the dusty gas in the wind is highly sub - eddington ( @xmath6 ) on vertical scales along the minor axis @xmath185kpc ( figure  [ fig : edd ] ) . on smaller scales , @xmath0 is more uncertain , but increases because of the decrease in the enclosed mass .",
    "we estimate @xmath186 at @xmath187kpc , with large uncertainties , depending on the dynamical mass of the central region , the distribution of absorbing material along the minor axis , and the true uv luminosity that escapes the central starburst region ( see equation  [ gammain ] ) .",
    "note that if the dust were hydrodynamically uncoupled from the gas , which appears unlikely , the grains would be super - eddington throughout the wind .",
    "in addition , the starburst was brighter by approximately a factor of four @xmath188myr ago ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "2003 ) , which in principle could to lead to @xmath0 as high as @xmath189 at @xmath187kpc .",
    "finally , within the starburst itself , we find that m82 appears to be close to the single - scattering eddington limit , implying that a significant fraction of the current ism could be ejected by radiation pressure .",
    "overall , our results provide quantitative constraints on theoretical models of superwinds launched wholly or in part by radiation pressure on dust in dwarf starbursts like m82 ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "2011 ; hopkins et al .  2012 ) .",
    "there are a number of directions for future work .",
    "perhaps most importantly , one could simultaneously model the scattering in a number of wavebands from the fuv through the nir , using the full frequency - dependent dust scattering phase function . by iterating with the observed surface brightness profiles in each band , a self - consistent model might be developed .",
    "information could also be included on the mir pah surface brightness as a function of height .",
    "such a study would constrain the dust geometry and grain size distribution more fully and perhaps allow for novel studies of the starburst population in reflection off the wind .",
