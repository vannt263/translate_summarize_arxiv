    "many numerical approaches which are based on the keldysh formalism require the solution of the two - time kadanoff - baym equations ( or the nonequilibrium dyson equation ) which are equations of motions for the one - particle nonequilibrium green s function defined on the keldysh contour  @xcite .",
    "the particular double - time and non - markovian form of these integro - differential equations generally renders their integration a non - trivial and challenging task .",
    "moreover , big efforts are needed to reach either long times , handling a large memory kernel , or to simulate quantum systems with many degrees of freedom and especially spatially inhomogeneous systems .    despite these obstacles ,",
    "much computational progress has been made over the recent decades , driven by the widespread success of nonequilibrium green s functions in various fields , including nuclear  @xcite , plasma  @xcite , semiconductor  @xcite , condensed matter  @xcite and atomic and molecular physics  @xcite .",
    "following the pioneering work of refs .",
    "@xcite , which focuses on the numerical simulation of heavy - ion collisions , time propagation schemes of the kadanoff - baym equations ( kbe ) have been developed in different contexts to study the correlation build - up in homogeneous fermion systems  @xcite .",
    "a general fortran code is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which efficiently evaluates the collision integrals ( convolutions ) by using fast fourier transforms of the momentum resolved green s function . concerning the treatment of initial correlations different pathways",
    "have been pursued which range from the use of adiabatic switching  @xcite and the embedding of additional collision terms derived from the equilibrium pair correlation function  @xcite to the extension of the real - time green s function onto the imaginary branch of the keldysh contour  @xcite . with the advance of computer power ,",
    "also finite and inhomogeneous systems have become accessible .",
    "a corresponding well recognized predictor - corrector - based time propagation code is described in ref .",
    "@xcite and is used in many applications .",
    "further progress is due to adapted basis sets which have been deployed to simplify the interaction ( coulomb ) matrix elements , e.g. , @xcite , and due to efficient parallelization strategies  @xcite , where the green s function is distributed over the memory of multiple compute nodes in such a way that the collision integrals can be calculated locally and a minimum communication is required to perform the time stepping .",
    "a feature , that is common to virtually all time propagation codes , is the direct evaluation of the memory kernel , i.e. , the computation of the collision integrals which cover the whole time history . together with the double - time structure of the green s function",
    ", this leads to the typical @xmath0-scaling of the numerical algorithms in the number of time steps .",
    "only further approximations can overcome this unfavorable scaling , such as the application of the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz  @xcite , which reconstructs the two - time green s function from its time - diagonal value and is expected to be a reasonable option to extend state - of - the art simulations , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the prevailing similarity of the time propagation schemes raises the question whether there exist alternative methods to solve the two - time kbe . aside from matrix inversion techniques , e.g.  @xcite ,",
    "a promising idea has been triggered by nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , where hamiltonian - based impurity solvers have recently become available through a two - time decomposition of the hybridization function  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that a similar decomposition of the self - energy can be used to derive an auxiliary hamiltonian representation of the kadanoff - baym equations , where the one - particle nonequilibrium green s function of the interacting many - body problem under consideration is obtained from a _ noninteracting _ auxiliary system which couples to additional bath orbitals the number of which is finite .",
    "although progress has been made recently by showing that a nonequilibrium self - energy has a unique lehmann representation  @xcite , the auxiliary hamiltonian method has so far been proven to be effective only for a local self - energy , which represents an approximation becoming exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions ( and is just the central approximation in dmft ) .    in this contribution",
    ", we show that the method can be extended rather easily to treat also non - local self - energies and that it is thus applicable more generally .",
    "particularly , it can improve the @xmath0-scaling in the same manner as in ref .",
