    "the hera collider , which operated at desy from 1992 to 2007 , has produced many important physics results , first of all perhaps the most precise determinations to date of the quark and gluon densities in the proton from single experiments ( h1 , zeus ) and their combined data sets @xcite .",
    "these data , taken in deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering , are complemented by a wealth of data from photoproduction at low virtuality @xmath0 of the exchanged photon , in particular on jet production @xcite , giving access also to the distributions of partons in the photon @xcite and to measurements of the strong coupling constant @xcite .    using the data set of the hera - ii phase of the hera collider from 2003 - 2007 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath1 ,",
    "the h1 collaboration have recently published final measurements of inclusive jet , dijet and three - jet production in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite and used them to determine the strong coupling constant ( at the mass @xmath2 of the @xmath3-boson ) to be _ s(m_z)=0.11850.0016 ( exp.)0.0040 ( th . ) , [ eq:1 ] taking into account absolute double - differential inclusive jet , dijet and three - jet cross section data as functions of @xmath0 and the jet transverse momentum @xmath4 .",

    "the latter uses only observables that are known to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) of perturbative qcd , while the analysis of the h1 collaboration was done in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy .",
    "the lack of knowledge of higher - order contributions becomes manifest in a bigger theoretical uncertainty due to scale variation in eq .",

    "[ eq:3 ]    in this letter , we compute the inclusive jet production dis cross section for the first time including nnlo contributions , obtained from a unified threshold resummation formalism @xcite , and extract an approximate nnlo ( annlo ) value for the strong coupling constant . our calculations are based on previous work on inclusive jet production in deep - inelastic scattering up to nlo @xcite .",
    "they reduce , as we will see , the theoretical prediction and increase the central fit value of the strong coupling constant , improving the description of the final hera data in particular at high photon virtuality @xmath0 .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem allows to write the differential cross section for inclusive jet production in neutral - current dis with high momentum transfer @xmath6 as a convolution of the partonic cross section @xmath7 with the parton densities in the proton @xmath8 and the flux of photons in electrons @xmath9 as @xmath10 where we define @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the momenta of the incoming proton and electron , respectively , and @xmath14 the momentum of the exchanged photon . in deep - inelastic scattering",

    "these coefficients agree with those found in photoproduction for massless jets for the direct part @xcite . for massive jets , additional logarithms depending on the jet radius @xmath24 appear ( e.g.  in @xmath25 ) @xcite , which are however irrelevant in the case @xmath26 as in the h1 analysis considered here @xcite .",
    "the calculation is analogous to the case of single - jet production in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "the above coefficients further depend on the qcd color factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 , on the one - loop @xmath29-function @xmath30 with @xmath31 the number of active quark flavors , the mandelstam variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the fixed large invariant scale @xmath36 , that in dis is equal to @xmath0 , whereas in photoproduction it was the mandelstam variable @xmath37 .",

    "it could be found in reference @xcite . for longitudinal polarization we took the formula directly from the source code of the corresponding program jetvip @xcite , that calculates inclusive jet production in dis to nlo accuracy .",
    "some two - loop quantities appearing in the nnlo master formula were not given explicitly in @xcite and could not been found in the respective literature . as in our previous work on jet photoproduction @xcite , they were therefore neglected .",
    "the nnlo contributions have been implemented in the code jetvip for inclusive jet and dijet production in dis , where the convolution over @xmath40 was already included for nlo initial - state corrections on the proton side . at nlo , we use of course our complete calculation and not only the logarithmically enhanced terms described above . as a numerical check , we have repeated the nlo analysis of inclusive single - differential jet production of the h1 collaboration , performed with nlojet++ @xcite and presented in reference @xcite , and found excellent agreement , confirming previous successful comparisons of different nlo programs for jet production in dis @xcite .",
    "the measurement took place during the hera - ii running period with an integrated luminosity of @xmath1 .",

    "the leptonic phase space was given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the jet phase space was restricted to the rapidity interval @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the pseudorapidity of a jet in the hera lab frame .",
    "the cross section was measured differentially in the jet transverse momentum @xmath4 and the virtuality @xmath0 .",
    "jets were reconstructed using the @xmath48-clustering algorithm @xcite in the breit frame , where exlusively electroweak processes can be ruled out by demanding a minimum of jet transverse momentum ( here @xmath49 ) . in inclusive jet production in dis ,",
    "an almost identical fit result for @xmath50 was obtained with the anti-@xmath48 algorithm .",
    "the jet radius was @xmath26 .",
    "the perturbative scales were chosen to be [ eq : scales ] _ r^2=(q^2+p_t^2)/2 _",
    "the perturbative hard - scattering functions were convoluted with the mstw2008 set of parton distribution functions in the proton with different fixed @xmath50 values @xcite .",
    "this pdf set especially offers the possibility to determine a best - fit @xmath50 .",
    "the number of active flavors was @xmath51 , since sea contributions of a heavy top quark inside the proton can safely be neglected .",
    "following the h1 analysis , we choose the pdf member with @xmath52 in all plots shown in this letter , which together with the scale choice from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scales ] ) defines our central fit .",
    "single - differential inclusive jet cross sections as a function of photon virtuality @xmath0 ( top ) and jet transverse momentum @xmath4 ( bottom ) in nlo ( green dashed lines ) and annlo ( blue full lines ) with the corresponding scale uncertainty bands , obtained by varying @xmath34 and @xmath35 simultaneously by a factor of two up and down , compared to the final h1 data ( red points , color online ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnloscv ] , we compare our nlo ( green dashed lines ) and annlo ( blue full lines ) results to the experimental data of the h1 collaboration ( red points ) .",
    "the uncertainty bands are obtained by varying both scales simultaneously about the central scales up and down by a factor of two as it was also done by the h1 collaboration .",
    "we have verified that our nlo results and uncertainty bands agree very well with those of the h1 analysis . comparing our calculations to the measurements , we see that the data points lie in the error bands of both the nlo and the annlo calculations . for the @xmath0 distribution ( top ) , the scale uncertainty is of similar size at nlo and annlo at low @xmath0 and is considerably reduced in annlo at higher @xmath0 as expected .",
    "we checked that this tendency continues and becomes more pronounced for even higher @xmath0 , where unluckily we have no data to compare with . for the @xmath4 distribution ( bottom ) , the scale uncertainty is not reduced from nlo to annlo , since analytically no logarithms of ratios of @xmath34 or @xmath35 over @xmath4 appear ( see above ) . while in our previous analysis of jet photoproduction the jet transverse momentum @xmath4 ranged from 17 to 71 gev @xcite , its range is restricted in dis and this analysis to lower values of 7 to 50 gev , while the photon virtuality reaches values up to @xmath53 gev)@xmath54 .",
    "same as fig .",
    "[ fig : nnloscv ] , but normalized to the central nlo predictions . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnloscvn ] , we show the same comparison normalized to the central nlo result .",
    "we also depict here the central annlo result , which is always smaller than the nlo central result by approximately 6% . the central @xmath0 distribution and",
    "even more the central @xmath4 distribution agree better with the h1 data at annlo than at nlo , as they then lie right within the experimental uncertainties . while the central nlo results overestimate the measured cross sections , indicating that the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath50 used at this order is too large , the central annlo results underestimate the data and require a slightly larger value of @xmath55 .",
    "the data are thus clearly sensitive to the strong coupling constant and can be used for an extraction not only at nlo , but also at annlo .",
    "however , we do not expect a significant reduction of the theoretical error from the scale uncertainty , in particular from the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "to determine the strong coupling constant from these comparisons , the theoretical calculations have to be performed with a set of parton densities in the proton obtained from global fits assuming different values of @xmath50 .",
    "for our analysis at annlo , we employ the latest fits of the mstw group , which have been obtained with nnlo running of the coupling , evolution of the parton densities , deep - inelastic scattering and vector - boson production matrix elements @xcite .",
    "22 different mstw2008 nnlo members were used , which correspond to values of @xmath57 to 0.127 . to compare the annlo best - fit @xmath55 to a corresponding nlo @xmath55 based on our full nlo calculation",
    ", we carry out the same approach with the nlo mstw2008 parton distribution functions .",
    "these are available for the range of @xmath58 to 0.130 .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath55 was determined by comparing the theoretical predictions at nlo and annlo to the experimental measurements by h1 and then finding the minimum value of the reduced @xmath59 .",
    "we present here our results for the single - differential @xmath4-distribution , but have verified that fitting the @xmath0-distribution yields very similar results . at nlo",
    "we find _ s^nlo(m_z)=0.1150.002(exp.)0.005(th . ) , where the central value is slightly lower than the one obtained by h1 from the unnormalized double - differential inclusive jet cross section ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) ) , but where the total experimental error and the theoretical error obtained from a simultaneous variation of the renormalization and factorization scales agree very well . at annlo ,",
    "@xmath55 gets shifted upwards , since we demonstrated above that the annlo contributions reduce the differential cross sections compared to nlo .",
    "we find _ s^annlo(m_z)=0.1220.002(exp.)0.013(th . ) , where the central value is now slightly above the world average , the experimental error is of course unchanged , and the theoretical error is slightly larger , reflecting the observation made above that the annlo calculation is not yet sufficiently stabilized by threshold logarithms at these values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical situation would only improve at higher values of @xmath0 , where unfortunately no experimental data are available .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented here a first calculation of inclusive - jet production in neutral - current deep - inelastic scattering up to nnlo of perturbative qcd . leading and subleading logarithmic contributions",
    "were extracted from a unified threshold resummation formalism for virtual photon - parton scattering processes and shown to agree with those appearing in our full nlo calculations .",
    "the annlo contributions implemented in our nlo program improve the description of the final h1 data on inclusive - jet production in the @xmath0 distribution and even more in the @xmath4 distribution , when the world average value of @xmath55 is used and for central scale choices .",
    "the scale uncertainties are reduced only at the highest values of @xmath0 , where threshold corrections are most important .",
    "an annlo fit of these data with the mstw2008 set of parton densities resulted in a new determination of the strong coupling constant at the mass of the @xmath3-boson that increased the central fit value from below to above the current world average , but did not reduce the theoretical error .",
