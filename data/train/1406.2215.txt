    "deriving quark confinement directly from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most important unsolved issues remaining in particle physics @xcite .",
    "although its analytical proof is not yet known from qcd , lattice qcd monte carlo simulations show that the static quark - antiquark ( q@xmath7 ) potential is well reproduced by a sum of the coulomb and linear confinement terms as @xcite @xmath8 with the interquark distance @xmath9 , the string tension @xmath10 , the color - coulomb coefficient @xmath11 , and an irrelevant constant @xmath12 .",
    "since quark confinement is phenomenologically interpreted with a linear interquark potential at long distances , the strength of quark confinement is controlled by the string tension @xmath10 , i.e. , the linear slope of the interquark potential . the linear confinement term @xmath13 is considered to be caused by `` one - dimensional squeezing '' of the interquark color - electric flux , which is shown by lattice qcd studies @xcite .",
    "historically , such a one - dimensional property of hadrons leads to several interesting theoretical frameworks , such as the string theory , the flux - tube picture @xcite , and the lund model @xcite for hadron reactions based on the schwinger mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , the physical origin of the color - flux squeezing is not yet clearly understood .",
    "for the one - dimensional color - flux squeezing , the dual - superconductor picture proposed by nambu , t  hooft and mandelstam in the 1970s @xcite seems to provide a plausible scenario . in this picture",
    ", the qcd vacuum is assumed to be a `` dual superconductor '' ( i.e. , the electromagnetic dual version of a superconductor ) , and the electric - flux squeezing is caused by the dual version of the meissner effect in superconductors , similar to the formation of the abrikosov vortex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this picture provides us with a guiding principle for the modeling of quark confinement .",
    "for example , based on the dual superconductivity , the dual ginzburg - landau theory @xcite is formulated as a low - energy effective model of qcd , and describes confinement phenomena and the flux - tube structure of hadrons .        however , there are two large gaps between the dual superconductor and the qcd vacuum :    * the dual superconductor is governed by an abelian u(@xmath14 ) gauge theory like qed , while qcd is a non - abelian su(@xmath15 ) gauge theory . *",
    "the dual superconductor requires the condensation of color - magnetic monopoles ( i.e. , the electromagnetic dual version of cooper pairs ) , while qcd does not have such monopoles as elementary degrees of freedom .    on account of these two gaps",
    ", it seems difficult to define the dual - superconducting picture precisely from qcd .",
    "indeed , the gluon field in qcd has both diagonal and off - diagonal parts , @xmath16 , with the diagonal generators ( cartan subalgebra ) @xmath17 and the off - diagonal generators @xmath18 of su(@xmath15 ) . here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the off - diagonal part @xmath21 induces the non - abelian nature .    as a possible solution to fill in the above two gaps , t  hooft proposed the `` abelian projection '' @xcite , a mathematical procedure to reduce qcd to an abelian gauge theory including monopole degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , lattice qcd studies @xcite indicate that the maximally abelian ( ma ) projection  a special abelian projection  seems to be successful in extracting infrared - relevant abelian degrees of freedom from qcd .",
    "( the concept of abelian projection may have wide utility , and it was recently applied to multiband superconductors in condensed matter physics @xcite . )",
    "the ma projection has two steps .",
    "( i ) the diagonal part of gluons @xmath22 is maximized by minimizing the off - diagonal part @xmath23 in euclidean su(3 ) qcd under the gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "this procedure , called ma gauge fixing , is a partial gauge fixing which remains abelian gauge degrees of freedom of u(1)@xmath24 .",
    "( ii ) su(3 ) qcd is projected onto a u(1)@xmath24 abelian gauge theory by dropping the off - diagonal part of gluons , @xmath21 .",
    "it is known that the ma - projected abelian theory well reproduces qcd phenomena at long distances , which is called  abelian dominance \" @xcite . as a remarkable fact in the ma gauge ,",
    "color - magnetic monopoles appear as the topological object corresponding to the nontrivial homotopy group @xmath25su@xmath26u@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus , by the ma projection , qcd is reduced to an abelian gauge theory including both electric- and magnetic - monopole currents , which is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the monopole - condensation scheme for the confinement mechanism .",
    "several lattice qcd studies show the appearance of monopole worldlines covering the whole system @xcite and the magnetic screening @xcite , which suggest `` monopole condensation '' .",
    "thus , the qcd system resembles a dual superconductor by way of the ma projection .",
    "however , such lattice studies were performed mainly in simplified su(2 ) color qcd , and there are only several pioneering studies on the abelian dominance of quark confinement in actual su(3 ) color qcd @xcite . stack  _ et  al . _",
    "first studied the abelian projection of the q@xmath7 potential using su(3 ) quenched lattice qcd with @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite , respectively .",
    "boryakov  _ et  al .",
    "_ investigated similar subjects in su(3 ) quenched qcd with @xmath32 at @xmath33 and full qcd , using the simulated annealing algorithm @xcite . also in su(3 ) color , approximate abelian dominance of the string tension",
    "was found as @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "( see table  [ tab1 ] . )    in this paper , we perform a quantitative analysis for the ma projection of the q@xmath7 potential in su(3 ) qcd at the quenched level .",
    "then , we examine the abelian dominance of quark confinement . after the ma gauge fixing , the su(3 )",
    "link variables are factorized with respect to the cartan decomposition of su(@xmath15 ) into u(1)@xmath24 and su(3)@xmath36u(1)@xmath24 .",
    "then , we calculate the original su(3 ) q@xmath7 potential @xmath3 , the abelian part @xmath4 , and the off - diagonal part @xmath5 . for each sector , we investigate both the linear confinement and coulomb parts through an accurate fit analysis .",
    ".the simulation conditions ( @xmath37 , the lattice size @xmath38 , and the gauge configuration number @xmath39 ) and the results ( lattice spacing @xmath40 , the physical spatial size @xmath41 , and the string tension ratio @xmath42 ) . here , the lattice spacing is determined so as to reproduce the string tension of @xmath43 gev / fm .",
    "the results of previous studies are shown on the last three lines .",
    "we investigate the six types of interquark directions , while stack _",

    "to calculate the q@xmath7 potentials accurately , we adopt the gauge - invariant smearing method , which reduces the excited - state components and enhances the ground - state overlap in the q@xmath7 system .",
    "we adopt the smearing parameter @xmath60 , which is a standard value for the measurement of the q@xmath7 potential @xcite , and the iteration number @xmath61 for su(3 ) qcd and the off - diagonal part at @xmath62 , respectively . for the abelian part",
    ", we adopt @xmath60 and the iteration number @xmath63 at @xmath62 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath64 is chosen so that the ground - state overlap is largely enhanced for each part and at each @xmath37 .",
    "we have confirmed that the result is almost unchanged when the iteration number @xmath64 is changed to some extent .",
    "we exclude the four small-@xmath9 data points ( @xmath65 in lattice units ) because they suffer from a large discretization .",
    "( many previous studies used the same manner , e.g. , refs .",
    "in addition , we exclude some large-@xmath9 data points because of a lack of statistics for convergence .",
    "we use the jackknife method for the error estimate . by way of illustration",
    ", we show the effective mass plots for each part in lattice units at @xmath66 for on - axis data in fig .",
    "[ supfig : meff64 ] . owing to the smearing",
    ", the effective mass seems to be stable even for small @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pot_dec](a ) shows the lattice qcd results of the original q@xmath7 potential @xmath3 , the abelian part @xmath4 , and the off - diagonal part @xmath5 at @xmath68 and @xmath31 . for each part",
    ", we show the best - fit curve of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cornell ] ) at @xmath68 .",
    "the fit analyses are summarized in table  [ tab : fit64 ] . remarkably , we find almost perfect abelian dominance of the string tension , @xmath69 , on the @xmath0 lattice at @xmath2 and on the @xmath32 lattice at @xmath70 , as summarized in table  [ tab1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the off - diagonal part @xmath5 has almost zero string tension , @xmath71 , and is almost a pure coulomb - type potential . to demonstrate the perfect abelian dominance conclusively , we investigate @xmath72 through a fit analysis with the coulomb - plus - linear ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cornell ] ) ( fit 1 ) and the pure coulomb ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cornell ] ) with @xmath73 ( fit 2 ) . in fig .  [ fig : pot_dec](b ) and table  [ tab : fit64 ] , fit 1 reveals that @xmath72 has almost zero string tension , @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 is well described by the pure coulomb ansatz ( fit 2 ) because fits 1 and 2 are consistent .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is no difference between the string tensions in @xmath3 and @xmath4 with almost perfect precision . on the smaller lattices of @xmath75 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 and @xmath32 at @xmath76 ,",
    "however , we can not see the perfect abelian dominance of the string tension as shown in table  [ tab1 ] . by using the on - axis data points on the @xmath29 lattice at @xmath77 ,",
    "only approximate abelian dominance , @xmath78 , was reported in the previous study by stack _",
    "_ @xcite . by using the five types of off - axis data with on - axis data ,",
    "the ratio @xmath79 is improved on @xmath32 at @xmath33 ( as shown in table  [ tab1 ] ) , but it is not perfect . also , we find only approximate abelian dominance on the @xmath75 lattice at @xmath77 and the @xmath32 lattice at @xmath80 , as @xmath81@xmath82 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the perfect abelian dominance of the string tension can be seen on the @xmath0 lattice at @xmath83 and the @xmath32 lattice at @xmath70 , but it can not seen on the @xmath75 and @xmath32 lattices at @xmath84 .",
    "it is likely that a large physical volume is necessary for the perfect abelian dominance of the string tension .",
    "in fact , as shown in table  [ tab1 ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : pad ] , the @xmath0 lattice at @xmath83 and the @xmath32 lattice at @xmath70 have large spatial volumes of @xmath85 fm and @xmath86 fm on a side , while the lattices of @xmath75 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 and @xmath32 at @xmath76 have slightly small spatial volumes of @xmath87@xmath88 fm .",
    "thus , perfect abelian dominance seems to be realized when the physical spatial volume of the lattice is approximately larger than @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "in contrast to abelian dominance for the long - distance confinement properties , there is a significant difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 at short distances .",
    "fine lattices are necessary for the accurate analysis of the short - distance behavior of the potential , and it is preferable to use our results obtained on the fine lattice at @xmath66 . from the analysis of the q@xmath91 potential @xmath3 , the abelian part @xmath4 , and the off - diagonal part @xmath5 , we find a simple but nontrivial summation formula of @xmath92 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pot_dec](c ) .",
    "this summation formula indicates that the short - distance difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is almost complemented by the off - diagonal part @xmath5 .",
    "note , however , that in the non - abelian theory this simple summation formula is fairly nontrivial , because the link variables are not commutable .",
    "in general , one finds @xmath93 i.e. , @xmath46   \\not = w_\\mathcal{c } \\left [ m_\\mu(s )   \\right ] \\cdot   w_\\mathcal{c } \\left [ u_\\mu(s )   \\right]$ ] , and therefore the summation formula  ( [ eq : nontrivial ] ) is nontrivial .    .",
    "perfect abelian dominance ( @xmath94 ) seems to be realized when the spatial size @xmath41 is sufficiently large .",
    ", width=291 ]",
    "we have studied the ma projection of quark confinement in su(3 ) lattice qcd by investigating the q@xmath7 potential @xmath3 , the abelian part @xmath4 , and the off - diagonal part @xmath5 .",
    "we have investigated various quenched lattices with several spacings and volumes , e.g. , @xmath0 lattice at @xmath2 , and have performed a potential analysis using both on - axis data and several types of off - axis data , with larger numbers of gauge configurations .",
    "remarkably , we have found almost perfect abelian dominance of the confinement force ( or the string tension ) on the large physical - volume lattice of @xmath0 at @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we have found a nontrivial simple summation formula of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in spite of the non - abelian nature of qcd , quark confinement is entirely kept in the abelian sector of qcd in the ma gauge . in other words ,",
    "the abelianization of qcd can be realized without the loss of the quark - confining force via the ma projection .",
