    "recent measurements@xcite of the microwave conductivity up to @xmath4ghz at low temperatures in single crystal oxygen ordered ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) have revealed that there remains significant absorption at @xmath5 in the superconducting state , while at the same time the inverse square of the penetration depth shows a linear in temperature behavior . in the regime where this happens , the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath6 shows an unusual characteristic upward curvature very different from a drude - like form .",
    "anomalous residual absorption has also been seen in the past in thz work on thin films of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath7 ( bi2212)@xcite and in this case was interpreted as due to coupling to a collective mode , with the spectral weight of this mode tracking the temperature dependence of the superfluid density .    in a pure @xmath0-wave bcs superconductor",
    "all of the optical spectral weight will go into the condensate at @xmath5 providing a delta function to the real part of the conductivity at zero frequency .",
    "this follows from the ferrell - glover - tinkham sum rule which holds when the kinetic energy change between normal and superconducting state is negligible .",
    "when elastic impurity scattering is introduced into the system , this no longer holds .",
    "some optical spectral weight will remain at finite frequency under the real part of the conductivity at @xmath5 and correspondingly , the superfluid density will be reduced below its pure limit value .",
    "at the same time , however , in the unitary ( strong ) limit of impurity scattering which is the most studied case so far , a switch from linear to quadratic behavior in temperature is expected for the penetration depth . in this work",
    "we consider the case when the impurity scattering strength falls in the intermediate regime between born ( weak ) and unitary ( strong ) limit .",
    "we find that for a range of impurity parameters , i.e. : concentration and strength of the potential measured in terms of the width of the electronic band , the residual , impurity induced absorption remains very significant , while at the same time the superfluid density obeys a quasilinear law over the entire low temperature range and , more importantly , @xmath6 shows anomalous behavior in agreement with the experimental observation in ortho - ii ybco .",
    "the general expression for the optical conductivity at temperature @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 is well known and has been given in many places.@xcite it can be written as :    @xmath10\\right\\rangle_\\theta ,    \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the plasma frequency and the function @xmath12 takes on the form @xmath13\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\frac{1}{e^\\ast_1-e_2}\\left[1 +       n^\\ast(\\theta,\\omega)n(\\theta,\\omega+\\nu )      + p^\\ast(\\theta,\\omega)p(\\theta,\\omega+\\nu)\\right ] .",
