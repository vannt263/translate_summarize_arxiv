    "for practical nanoscale applications , including spintronics , the quality of an interface matters . to develop new devices it is important to understand their properties .",
    "the normal reflection coefficient @xmath3 , or the complementary transmission coefficient @xmath4 , is one of the parameters that characterizes an interface .",
    "it informs how large a fraction of the incident electrical current is not transported through an interface .",
    "reflection or transmission at metal interfaces has mainly been investigated with the help of superconducting proximity effect measurements  @xcite and the current perpendicular to the plane magnetoresistance ( cpp - mr ) studies  @xcite using thin films .",
    "point - contact andreev reflection spectroscopy offers a different approach to this problem and does not require thin - film samples .",
    "it is a differential method as it compares the normal reflection of the two - particle electron - hole process to that of a single - particle one .",
    "andreev reflection at a superconductor - normal metal interface is described by the btk - model  @xcite with only three adjustable parameters : the energy gap of the superconductor @xmath5 , the temperature @xmath6 which is measured independently , and the relative strength @xmath2 of a @xmath7-function interface barrier .",
    "this simple model has been extended to take into account the effects of spin polarization  @xcite and the finite cooper pair lifetime  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the btk @xmath2 parameter consists of two parts , @xmath8 describing the strength of a real tunneling barrier at the contact and @xmath9 the reflection caused by the mismatch of the different electronic structures on each side of the interface .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter is related to the transmission coefficient @xmath10 . without tunneling barrier",
    "only fermi surface mismatch contributes , providing a lower limit for the reflection coefficient of a specific metal - metal combination when a tunneling barrier is absent .",
    "we present here the results of our point contact measurements on the normal reflection at interfaces between superconducting nb and al in contact with non - magnetic noble metals ag , cu and pt .",
    "most of the measurements with nb ( @xmath11 k ) were carried out at @xmath12 k in liquid helium",
    ". a smaller number of interfaces with nb and all contacts with al ( @xmath13 k ) were measured down to @xmath14 k in vacuum .",
    "the contacts were formed between two pieces of wire ( 0.25 mm diameter ) using the shear method .",
    "their differential resistance was recorded in the standard four - wire scheme with low - frequency current modulation .",
    "a review of experimental point - contact techniques is given in  @xcite .",
    "the differential resistance spectra can be divided into different groups  @xcite of which we have analysed only those contacts with an andreev - type spectra with or without side peaks using the modified btk model that takes into account the finite cooper pair lifetime  @xcite .",
    "the normal - state resistance was restricted to 1 - 100 @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ spektrit ] displays representative spectra and their fits of normal metals in contacts with al .",
    "spectra with nb look qualitatively similar  @xcite .",
    "typical al - normal metal spectra measured at 0.1 k in vacuum . the black solid line is the measured spectrum and the red dashed line is the fit from the modified btk model.,width=604 ]    figure  [ nb ] summarizes the results of this analysis for nb and al contacts .",
    "the data points are strongly concentrated at preferred @xmath2 values as can easily be seen in the histograms .",
    "the distributions of the contacts both with nb and al have clear onsets , finite widths and in some cases a weak tail at large @xmath2 values .",
    "the ag - nb distribution consists apparently of two separate peaks .",
    "this could be caused by different preferred crystal orientations .",
    "the @xmath2 values vary only weakly with the normal - state resistance @xmath16 in the specified range ( figure  [ r ] ) .    the distribution of the lifetime parameter @xmath17 and number of contacts of nb - normal metal and al - normal metal contacts as function of the strength of the interface barrier @xmath2.,width=604 ]    the @xmath2 parameter as function of the contact resistance for nb and al in contact with normal metals .",
    "the thin red @xmath18 lines are a guide to the eye.,width=604 ]    .[taulukko ] the @xmath2 values for the investigated metal interfaces .",
    "the values marked with a * have been calculated from numerical data based on the free electron model in  @xcite and * * are calculated from @xmath19 values in  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "interfaces between different metals should always have some amount of normal reflection caused by their different electronic structures , the so called fermi surface mismatch ( fsm ) .",
    "it is difficult to predict exactly the contribution of fsm to normal reflection because it depends strongly on the material and the crystal orientations at the interface .",
    "the onset of the @xmath20 histograms defines the smallest possible value for the @xmath2 parameter ( or the maximum transmission coefficient ) which has been reached in our experiments .",
    "we believe that these contacts have a negligible tunneling barrier and the crystal directions are `` ideal '' .",
    "the position of the peak agrees rather well with the average @xmath2 value .",
    "there are also few data points at larger @xmath2 values .",
    "these can be attributed to an additional weak tunneling barrier at the contact .",
    "the width of the @xmath2 distribution is unlikely to be caused by tunneling because that should be less reproducible and lead to a wider variation of the observed @xmath2 values .",
    "the @xmath2 values obtained from our analysis are presented in table  [ taulukko ] .",
    "thin film proximity effect measurements have lead to transmission coefficients of only approximately 0.3 for nb in contact with non - magnetic normal metals  @xcite .",
    "cpp - mr studies result in transmission coefficients of similar size even though there should be no oxide barriers in either of these experiments  @xcite .",
    "we can only speculate that our much larger transmission coefficients could be caused , for example , by effects related to the different size of the samples or different properties of thin films and bulk wires .",
    "it might also be possible that the different measurement techniques observe different effects - we are investigating andreev reflection as function of bias voltage and in the proximity effect as well as in the cpp - mr studies the transport is observed at zero bias .",
    "the histograms in figure  [ nb ] also highlight the differences and similarities of the investigated interfaces .",
    "apart from the clearly double - peaked ag - nb distribution , the other superconductor - normal metal histograms look surprisingly similar .",
    "all the normal metals have almost the same @xmath2 with both nb and al despite their strongly different fermi surfaces  @xcite . on the other hand , the lifetime parameter @xmath17 at the interface",
    "does not depend on the normal metal , but differs for the two investigated superconductors .",
    "it appears to scale with the critical temperature @xmath21 or the superconducting energy gap @xmath22 .",
    "both observations pose interesting questions for future research .",
    "we have investigated normal reflection at interfaces between noble metals and superconducting nb and al .",
    "the measured differential resistance spectra were analysed with a modified btk model which yielded a rather well - defined @xmath2 parameter of normal reflection which seems to represent fermi surface mismatch .",
    "we thank the jenny and antti wihuri foundation and the finnish concordia fund for financial support ."
