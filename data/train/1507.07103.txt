    "spin - orbital coupling phenomena are ubiquitous in solids and have been known to exist since the early days of quantum mechanics and band theory , but only recently it was realized that the quantum nature of orbital degrees of freedom plays a crucial role in the fields of strongly correlated electrons @xcite and cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the growing evidence of spin - orbital entanglement ( soe ) accumulated due to novel experimental techniques which probe a variety of underlying electronic states .",
    "the strong coulomb interactions and the relativistic spin - orbit interaction entangle locally the spin and orbital degrees of freedom @xcite which display an amazing variety of fundamentally new and fascinating phenomena , ranging from topologically nontrivial states @xcite , relativistic mott - insulating behavior in @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite transition - metal oxides and entanglement on superexchange bonds in spin - orbital models @xcite .",
    "other more recent developments include entangled spin - orbital excitations @xcite , doped spin - orbital systems @xcite , skyrmion lattices in the chiral metal mnsi @xcite , multiferroics , spin - hall effects @xcite , majorana and weyl fermions @xcite , topological surface states @xcite , kondo systems @xcite , exotic spin textures in disordered systems , to name just a few",
    ".    to date , experimental observation of a dynamic spin - orbital state has been a challenge .",
    "apart from the intrinsic anisotropy and the relative complexity of the orbital couplings , it has been shown that the interplay between the two frustrated degrees of freedom may lead to exotic states of matter .",
    "an x - ray scattering study of a dynamic spin - orbital state in the frustrated magnet ba@xmath5cusb@xmath6o@xmath7 supports spin liquid state @xcite , while fesc@xmath6s@xmath8 @xcite and the @xmath9 effective models on the triangular lattice @xcite and on the honeycomb lattice @xcite are found to be candidates for spin - orbital liquids in the theory .",
    "recently remarkable progress was achieved due to rapidly developed resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) techniques @xcite which helped to explore the elementary excitations in sr@xmath6cuo@xmath5 @xcite and sr@xmath6iro@xmath8 @xcite , with antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferro - orbital ( fo ) order in ground states .",
    "orbital order in the spin - gapped dimerised system sr@xmath5cr@xmath6o@xmath10 below the jahn - teller transition was also identified @xcite .",
    "however , it remains challenging experimentally and theoretically , mainly owing to the lack of an ultimate understanding of spin - orbital correlations .    in the mott insulators with an idealized perovskite structure ,",
    "the low - energy physics is described by spin - orbital models , similar to the kugel - khomskii model @xcite , where the spin and orbital are considered on equal footing as dynamic quantum variables @xcite .",
    "spin interaction possesses su(2 ) symmetry , which will be broken however by the relativistic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it couples spins to the orbitals , that are in general non - su(2)-symmetric in a solid .",
    "however , this coupling can frequently be neglected in realistic @xmath11 systems and one is left in general with entangled spin - orbital superexchange problem @xcite , that is the eigenstates can not be written as products of spin and orbital wave functions .",
    "one immediate consequence of entanglement is that spin and orbital terms can not be factorized in the mean - field approach .",
    "orbitals are spatially anisotropic and thus their interactions have lower symmetry than the spin ones which reflects the directional dependence of the orbital wave functions . for the fixed occupation of orbitals , the magnitude and sign of the spin - orbital superexchange interactions follow the classical goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite , but quantum fluctuations change them and make it necessary to consider spin - orbital interplay in entangled states on exchange bonds @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure whether eigenstates are entangled or not .",
    "a natural measure of soe is the von neumann entropy ( vne ) which we write first for the nondegenerate ground state @xmath12 , @xmath13 here we consider a system @xmath14 composed of two non - overlapping subsystems @xcite , i.e. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the reduced density matrix .",
    "it is obtained by integrating the density matrix over subsystem @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "however , one has to realize that information contained in entanglement entropy depends crucially on how one partitions the hilbert space of the system . to investigate soe we use here as two subsystems @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath18 the spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the entire chain .",
    "standard spin - orbital phases may have entanglement in only one sector and here we concentrate on joint soe @xcite .",
    "this choice is distinct from the one conventionally made when the system is separated into two spatially complementary parts @xcite , for instance in frustrated spin chains @xcite or in the periodic 1d anderson model @xcite .",
    "though much attention was devoted to the ground state in the past @xcite , it has been noticed only recently that the entanglement entropy of low - energy excitations may provide even more valuable insights @xcite which are of crucial importance to understand the origin of quantum phase transitions in spin - orbital systems @xcite .",
    "the well known area law of the bipartite entanglement entropy restricts the hilbert space accessible to a ground state of gapped systems @xcite , while the area law is violated by a leading logarithmic correction in critical systems , whose prefactor is determined by the number of chiral modes and precisely given by widom conjecture @xcite . in this respect , the application of the entanglement entropy in describing quantum criticality in many - body hamiltonian merits a lot of studies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the excited states have the mixture of logarithmic and extensive entanglement entropy , and the logarithmic states are expected to be negligible in number compared to all the others . the entanglement in excited state",
    "is proven always larger than that of the ground state of a spin chain @xcite . for a spin - orbital coupled system",
    ", the division of spin and orbital operators retains the real - space symmetries , which is beneficial to the calculation of mutual entanglement . in two - particle states ,",
    "the soe is determined by the inter - component coherence length @xcite , as though the state has sufficient decay of correlations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use the entanglement entropy to investigate the full phase diagram of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) anisotropic spin - orbital su(2)@xmath0 model .",
    "the main motivation for considering the ising asymmetry in the orbital sector comes from the observation that spin - orbital entanglement is large when both subsystems , i.e. , spin and orbital sectors , reveal strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus the ising anisotropy which is present in many physical systems introduces additional control of orbital fluctuations and thereby provides an important control parameter for soe .",
    "here we focus on the model with negative exchange interaction .",
    "this choice of the exchange coupling restricts somewhat joint spin - orbital fluctuations being particularly large near the su(4 ) symmetric point in the 1d spin - orbital model with _ positive _ coupling constant @xcite , but opens novel possibilities for entangled states , as we show below @xcite .",
    "an interesting phase with entangled ground state , consisting of alternating spin singlets along the spin - orbital ring , is found for ising orbital interactions when the dimerization in the spin channel induces the change from fo to alternating orbital ( ao ) correlations .",
    "here we report the complete phase diagram of the anisotropic su(2)@xmath0 spin - orbital model , with two phases of similar nature which gain energy from singlet correlations leading to dimerization , either in spin or in orbital sector .",
    "these phases were overlooked before in the fully symmetric case , i.e. , in the phase diagram of the isotropic su(2)@xmath2su(2 ) model @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the nature of spin - orbital excited states , particularly in the case of the disentangled ferromagnetic ( fm ) and fo ground state , labeled as fm / fo order .",
    "we also analyze entanglement entropy in the excited states for the fm / fo phase and show that spin - orbital excitations form a continuum , supplemented by collective bound states .",
    "the latter states are characterized by a logarithmic scaling behavior , and as we show could be detected by properly designed rixs experiments @xcite .",

    "some additional technical insights which are accessible by an exact solution of the two - site model are presented in the appendix .",
    "we consider the 1d spin - orbital hamiltonian which couples @xmath21 spins and @xmath22 orbital ( pseudospin ) operators , @xmath23 with su(2 ) spin heisenberg interaction @xmath24 , orbital anisotropic @xmath1 interaction @xmath25 , @xmath26 we take below @xmath27 as the energy unit .",

    "we emphasize that the coupling constant @xmath35 is _ negative _ , so at large @xmath36 and @xmath37 it gives a disentangled fm / fo ground state , see below  therefore the model may be called in short fm .",
    "this choice of the exchange coupling restricts somewhat joint spin - orbital fluctuations being large near the su(4 ) symmetric point , @xmath38 , in the 1d spin - orbital model with _ positive _ , i.e. , af coupling constant @xcite , but opens other interesting possibilities for entangled states , as we have shown recently @xcite .",
    "both total spin magnetization @xmath39 and orbital polarization @xmath40 are conserved , and time reversal symmetry leads to the total momentum either @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "before analyzing the spin - orbital model of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in more detail , let us summarize briefly the properties of the well known af model , with positive coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "the su(4 ) symmetric hamiltonian found at @xmath38 is an integrable model which can be solved in terms of the bethe _ ansatz _ @xcite .",
    "away from the su(4 ) symmetric points this choice of the coupling constant favors the phases with spin - orbital order depending on the actual values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the phase diagram obtained by numerical methods includes in general phases with all types of coupled spin - orbital order , i.e. , fm / fo , af / fo , af / ao , and fm / ao , as well as the gapless spin - orbital liquid phase near the su(4 ) point @xcite . in addition , schwinger boson analysis gives phases with spin - orbital valence - bond correlations and also spin valence bond and orbital valence - bond phases @xcite .",
    "the latter two show a tendency towards dimerised spin or orbital correlations which occur here in the proximity of the su(4 ) point .",
    "for some special choice of parameters the model can be solved exactly : ( i ) when @xmath33 and @xmath44 , the exact ground state is doubly degenerate with the spins and the orbitals forming singlets on alternate bonds , while ( ii ) when @xmath34 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the non - haldane spin - liquid ground state can be analytically obtained @xcite , and ( iii ) several integrable cases were presented for interactions with special symmetries @xcite , or ( iv ) with @xmath47 orbital interactions ( @xmath48 ) @xcite .",

    "( [ som ] ) is not the most general one but is representative for real spin - orbital systems with anisotropic orbital interactions . in real systems",
    "the orbital part contributes by additional superexchange terms which are not coupled to su(2 ) spin interaction @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath49 orbital degrees of freedom as in the perovskite titanates or vanadates , the interactions along the @xmath50 cubic axis involve the doublet of two orbitals active along it , i.e. , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals @xcite ; a similar situation is encountered in a tetragonal crystal field of a quasi-1d mott insulator @xcite , or for @xmath53 and @xmath54 orbitals of a 1d fermionic optical lattice @xcite .",

    "we investigate below these composite quartic correlations and show that they could also be surprisingly large . as an additional criterion of setting up the phase diagram",
    ", we use below the fidelity susceptibility which elucidates the change rate of ground states in the parameter space @xcite .",

    "this may happen in real compounds in two ways : ( i ) either only one of the two active orbitals is occupied by one electron and contributes in the hopping processes along the 180@xmath63 bonds @xcite or 90@xmath63 bonds @xcite , or ( ii ) the orbital degrees of freedom are quenched in the presence of strong crystal field . in both these cases the orbital exchange ( orbital - flip ) processes are blocked and orbital interaction are of a classical ising - like form .",
    "such ising interactions are frustrated when they emerge in higher dimension , as in the well - studied orbital compass model @xcite and in kitaev model @xcite , see also a recent review on the compass model @xcite .",
