    "inspired by research in the field of turbulence , simonsen , jensen , and johansen @xcite considered `` inverse statistics '' of financial time series : what is the smallest time interval needed for an asset to cross a fixed return level @xmath0 ?",
    "figure [ fig : djia_fpt ] shows the distribution of this random variable , the _ first passage time _ , for the dow jones industrial average index , for @xmath1 . as noted by jensen , johansen , and simonsen @xcite , the most likely first passage time is shorter for @xmath2 than for @xmath3 , which they refer to as the _ gain / loss asymmetry_.    in this paper , we show that the gain / loss asymmetry in the dow jones index vanishes if the time series is `` scrambled ''  that is , if one considers a new time series constructed by randomly permuting the returns .",
    "this basic fact , which seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature so far , has important implications : the gain / loss asymmetry is _ not _ due to properties of the unconditional index returns , like skewness , but is rather an expression of potentially complex temporal structure .",
    "this finding resonates with the results from siven , lins , and lundbek  hansen @xcite , where wavelet analysis is used to demonstrate that the gain / loss asymmetry is a long time scale phenomenon  it vanishes if enough low frequency content is removed from the index , that is , if the index is sufficiently `` detrended . '' siven , lins , and lundbek  hansen @xcite also present a generalization of the asymmetric synchronous market model from donangelo , jensen , simonsen , and sneppen @xcite where prolonged periods of high correlation between the individual stocks during index downturns gives rise to a gain / loss asymmetry .",
    "whether the constituents of e.g.  the dow jones index indeed tend to move with a greater degree of dependence during market downturns could in principle be tested empirically by analysis of the time series of the individual stocks .",
    "that is an awkward task , however , since the relative weights for different stocks in these indices have changed over time in complicated ways . to address this issue",
    ", we demonstrate that if one defines a new , artificial index by simply taking the average of a number of stocks , this index also displays gain / loss asymmetry . with the constituents readily available , we consider two measures based on correlation and mutual information , and",
    "show that there indeed is a higher degree of dependence between the stock returns during index downturns than upturns .     for the log price of the dow jones industrial average index ( left ) and its scrambled version ( right ) .",

    "for a given process @xmath5 , for instance daily closing prices of a stock index , the first passage time @xmath6 of the level @xmath0 is defined as @xmath7 and is assumed to be independent of @xmath8 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath6 is estimated in a straightforward manner from a time series @xmath9 .",
    "consider @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 be the smallest time point such that @xmath12 , if such a time point exists . in that case , @xmath13 is viewed as an observation of @xmath6 .",
    "( if @xmath14 , take instead @xmath11 such that @xmath15 . ) running @xmath8 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 gives a set of observations from which the distribution of @xmath6 is estimated as the empirical distribution .",
    "given the empirical distribution , we follow jensen , johansen , and simonsen @xcite and compute a fit of the density function for the generalized gamma distribution .",
    "this density is plotted as a solid line together with the empirical distribution in all figures , to guide the eye  we do not discuss the fitted parameters , nor claim that @xmath6 truly follows a generalized gamma distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : djia_fpt ] shows the estimated first passage time for the dow jones index . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", there is a gain / loss asymmetry in that the most likely first passage time is shorter for @xmath2 than for @xmath3 .",
    "next , we construct a _ scrambled _ version of the index by randomly re - arranging the log returns . formally , if @xmath18 denotes the time series of daily closing prices of the dow jones index , let @xmath19 for @xmath20 and draw a random permutation @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "we define @xmath23 and let the scrambled index be given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 figure [ fig : djia_fpt ] shows that the scrambled index does _ not _ display a gain / loss asymmetry .",
    "this result is surprisingly strong : since the empirical return distributions are identical for an index and any of its scrambled versions , it shows that the gain / loss asymmetry is an expression of potentially complex temporal structure in the index .",
    "this fits nicely with the results from siven , lins , and lundbek  hansen @xcite , where a multiscale decomposition is used to demonstrate that the gain / loss asymmetry is a long rather than short scale phenomenon .",
    "the gain / loss asymmetry in the asymmetric synchronous market model from donangelo , jensen , simonsen , and sneppen @xcite does not disappear when the index returns are scrambled .",
    "this is to be expected , since the daily returns in that model are independent and identically distributed , so all statistical properties remain the same when the time series is scrambled .",
    "however , for the generalized model proposed in siven , lins , and lundbek  hansen @xcite the asymmetry _ does _ vanish , in perfect agreement with the dow jones index , see figure [ fig : gasmm ] .     for the log price in a realization of the generalized asynchronous market model from siven , lins , and lundbek  hansen @xcite ( left ) and",

    ", our general intuition is that the individual stocks tend to `` move together '' to a greater degree during index downturns than during upturns , resulting in more violent downturns than upturns . to quantify this",

    "we define the set of indices for which the daily returns belong to a window over which the index went up , @xmath42 respectively went down , @xmath43 note that the sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 are disjoint",
    ". we will consider two measures of dependence between all the individual stocks and evaluate it for the returns corresponding to days @xmath46 , and compare that to the same measures evaluated for days @xmath47 . before describing the first measure , the mean of mutual information , we establish some additional notation .",

    "the mutual information of two discrete stochastic variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denote the joint and @xmath55 and @xmath56 the marginal probability functions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "mutual information can be written as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the marginal entropies , and @xmath60 is the joint entropy of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and it is a measure of dependence in the sense that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are independent if and only if @xmath61 .",
    "mutual information can estimated from a finite set @xmath62 of joint samples of @xmath63 in a number of different ways , see paninski @xcite . in the computations below we",
    "apply the most straightforward estimator , the so - called plug - in estimator .",
    "let @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the mutual information of the returns of the @xmath28th stock and index , estimated from the samples @xmath66 respectively @xmath67 .",
    "we average over @xmath28 to obtain the _",
    "mean mutual information _",
    ", which can be seen as a measure of the degree of dependence between all the stocks over periods of upturns , and , respectively , downturns of the index @xmath33 : @xmath68    figure [ fig : mi ] shows the mean mutual information for varying window length  there is clearly a higher degree of dependence between the stocks returns during index downturns .",
    "however , given the hypothesis that stocks tend to `` move together '' to a greater degree during index downturns , with the result that downturns are more dramatic than upturns , there is a potential problem with the measure : the mutual information between the @xmath28th stock and index is large whenever there is a high degree of dependence , not only when they tend to move in the same direction .",
    "if some stocks tend to move up when the index moves down , this would moderate the downturns , contrary to our intuition , and yet result in high values for the mean mutual information . for this reason",
    ", we also consider a correlation based measure .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the correlation between the returns of the @xmath28th stock and index , estimated from the samples @xmath66 respectively @xmath67 .",
    "we average over @xmath28 to obtain the _ mean correlation _ , which can be seen as a measure of the degree of dependence between all the stocks over periods of upturns respectively downturns of the index @xmath33 : @xmath71 figure [ fig : mi ] shows the mean correlation for varying window length  this measure of dependence between the stock returns also show markedly higher values during index downturns that during index upturns .",
    "contrary to the mean mutual information , however , the presence of `` defensive '' stocks that move up during index downturns would give negative contributions .    .",
    "the graphs show the mean mutual information and correlation corresponding to index upturns ( stars ) respectively downturns ( rings).,width=453 ]",
    "if the gain / loss asymmetry observed for stock indices were a property of the unconditional distribution of returns , then the phenomenon should remain invariant under random permutations of the returns  this is not the case , as we have demonstrated .",
    "we may begin to rely more confidently on expectations derived from the generalized asymmetric synchronous market model , which have previously demonstrated that differences in correlated movements in index constituents for down - moves and up - moves can give rise to the kind of temporal dependence structure that produces such asymmetry . however , there are practical difficulties in exploring the correlations between the time series of the individual constituents of real stock indices , since these are not readily available , so we have shown that the gain / loss asymmetry can also be reproduced in an artificial stock index constructed as a simple average of a number of individual stocks .    considering two different measures of dependence ,",
    "mean mutual information and mean correlation , we concluded that there indeed is a greater degree of dependence between the constituents of the artificial index during downturns than upturns .",
    "this part of our analysis can be seen as an attempt to overcome some of the general difficulties in formulating tractable ways of analyzing non - stationary dependence structure in multivariate stochastic processes .",
    "future work in the direction of analyzing the dynamics of the changes in the level of dependence between asset prices would certainly be interesting  not least from the perspective of investors who seek diversification that does not break down at the worst possible time .",
    "for instance , is it possible to design a localized measure of the level of dependence between stock prices and zoom in even more on the points in time where it is changing ?",
