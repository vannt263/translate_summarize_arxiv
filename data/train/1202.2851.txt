    "it is now thought that most , if not all , of the stars in our galaxy were born in star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . and yet",
    ", there remain several key details of the star formation process that are still not understood .",
    "part of the problem lies in the fact that populations of young stars are typically hidden by a dense veil of optically - thick gas and dust .",
    "this prevents the escape of most of the light produced by infant stars , and often renders these regions difficult to observe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these clusters are sparsely populated and are of relatively low mass ( m @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath0 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are also very young since clusters of such low mass are unlikely to survive for more than 1 gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    at the other end of the cluster mass spectrum ,",
    "most massive star clusters ( m @xmath3 10@xmath2 m@xmath0 ) in our galaxy tend to be at least a few gyrs old , and in many cases are nearly as old as the universe itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these clusters have the advantage that they are no longer obscured by the primordial gas from which they formed , however they are a dynamically active environment . as a result , the conditions present at the time of their formation",
    "have now been largely erased ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this presents a considerable challenge for studying star formation in the regime of cluster masses and metallicities that characterize milky way globular clusters .",
    "this is unfortunate since these old star clusters contain the fossil record of a very early episode of star formation in the universe , and are the only means of studying it locally in massive star clusters .",
    "one of the primary observational tests for star formation theories is the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "current observational evidence suggests that the imf is very similar in different regions of our galaxy , including the disk and young star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this is still being debated throughout the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "different star formation theories tend to predict different imfs .",
    "these vary with the properties of the gas clouds from which the stars are born , including density , temperature and composition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the sensitive nature of the observations , a large sample of imfs spanning the entire range of cluster properties exhibited by star clusters in the milky way , including total mass and chemical composition , has yet to be compiled .",
    "this is a sorely needed step in order to advance our understanding of star formation by providing direct comparisons between observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "this is especially true of massive , metal - poor star clusters since we are particularly lacking observations of imfs in this regime of cluster masses and metallicites ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "important steps in this direction were recently taken by @xcite and @xcite , who studied the present - day mass functions of a large sample of galactic clusters and considered the effects of the cluster dynamics in modifying them from their primordial forms .",
    "for the very first time , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) survey for globular clusters has provided photometry for a large sample of milky way globular clusters ( gcs ) that reaches down to unprecedented faint magnitudes .",
    "this offers a large sample of current stellar mass functions spanning the stellar mass range @xmath4 m@xmath0 .",
    "all of the clusters are massive and very old , with total masses and ages ranging from @xmath5 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath0 and @xmath5 10 - 12 gyrs , respectively @xcite .",
    "this has allowed significant time for their stellar mass functions to have been modified from their primordial forms due to both stellar evolution and stellar dynamics . however , most of the processes responsible for this evolution are now largely understood .",
    "therefore , in principle , it is possible to use current observations of old star clusters together with theoretical models for their evolution to extrapolate backwards in time and indirectly probe their imfs .    for most of the life of a massive star cluster , two - body relaxation is the dominant physical mechanism driving its evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the term describes the cumulative effects of long - range gravitational interactions that occur between pairs of stars , which act to alter their orbits within the cluster .",
    "this results in a phenomenon known as mass segregation , which is the tendency for heavier stars to accumulate in the central cluster regions and low - mass stars to be dispersed to wider orbits .",
    "this mechanism also causes stars to escape from their host cluster , with the probability of ejection increasing with decreasing cluster mass .",
    "therefore , two - body relaxation acts to slowly modify the distribution of stellar masses within clusters , and can cause very dynamically evolved clusters to appear severely depleted of their low - mass stars .",
    "evidence in favour of this process having actually occurred in real star clusters has been reported by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of theoretical studies have been conducted to learn how the evolution of the stellar mass function ( mf ) in gcs is affected by two - body relaxation , stellar evolution , disc shocking , and tidal effects from the galaxy ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) . in the absence of these effects",
    ", we expect the mf to continually rise toward lower stellar masses . by performing a series of n - body simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that tidal effects from the galaxy , disc shocking , and a higher initial central concentration all act to increase the rate of stellar evaporation , and accelerate the depletion of preferentially low - mass stars .",
    "these results were confirmed and built upon by @xcite who showed that the depletion of low - mass stars can be sufficiently dramatic to change the sign of the slope of the mf at the low - mass end .",
    "interestingly , these results were not supported by the observational study of @xcite .",
    "these authors analyzed the mfs in a sample of 20 galactic gcs , and found that the slope of the mf decreases with increasing central concentration .",
    "they argued that this contradicts what is expected from theory since two - body relaxation is responsible both for increasing the central density and flattening the mf at the low - mass end . in an effort to explain this",
    ", they suggested that many of the clusters in their sample could be post - core collapse , and therefore had much higher central densities in the past .",
    "alternatively , @xcite argued that this can be explained by residual gas - expulsion from initially mass segregated clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and cautioned that unresolved binaries could also be contributing .",
    "several theoretical studies have also been conducted to study the dynamical histories of individual globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite recently performed the first ever direct n - body simulations of a milky way ( mw ) gc over its entire lifetime .",
    "this was done for the distant gc palomar 14 , which has an unusually low - density and large radius .",
    "the emphasis of this paper is to use the ensemble information of many gcs to learn about the universality of the imf in old massive star clusters .",
    "individual cases , in particular pal 14 , are often chosen for their peculiar characteristics and may not be representative of the bulk of the gcs in the mw .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new technique to quantify cluster - to - cluster variations in the observed stellar mass functions of a large sample of clusters spanning a diverse range of properties .",
    "our method offers the advantage that it is insensitive to the precise functional form of the mf .",
    "we have applied it to a sample of 27 mfs taken from the acs survey for globular clusters @xcite .",
    "can the present - day mfs be explained by an universal imf and stellar evaporation induced by two - body relaxation ? or are cluster - specific imfs needed to reproduce the observed mfs ? to address these questions , we compared the results of our observational analysis to 268 monte carlo simulations for gc evolution .",
    "the models spanned a range of initial masses , virial radii , central concentrations and imfs .",
    "therefore , by evolving all of these models to the current ages of the gcs in our sample and comparing the resulting mfs to the present - day observed ones , we have quantified the dynamical evolution of the mfs in our observed sample . this has allowed us to take the first steps toward constraining both the exact functional forms of the imfs of mw gcs and the conditions present at the time of their formation .    in section  [ method ]",
    ", we present our sample of observed stellar mass functions and describe both our technique for analyzing the observations and the models for globular cluster evolution to which they are compared .",
    "the results of our analysis of the acs observations are presented in section  [ results ] , along with an example comparison between the observations and the models .",
    "this example demonstrates how our method can be used to compare a large number of observed mfs to analogous samples of simulated mfs .",
    "finally , we discuss in section  [ discussion ] the implications of our results for the conditions present in our observed clusters at the time of their formation and the role played by two - body relaxation in modifying the stellar mf to its present - day form .",
    "in this section , we describe how we acquired our sample of mass functions from the acs data , as well as the monte carlo simulations for globular cluster evolution used for comparison to the observations .",
    "the data used in this study was taken from the sample of 35 mw gcs used in @xcite , which was in turn taken from the acs survey for globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the acs survey provides unprecedented deep photometry in the f606w ( @xmath5 v ) and f814w ( @xmath5 i ) filters that is nearly complete down to @xmath7 m@xmath0 . in other words , the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds )",
    "extend reliably from the horizontal branch all the way down to about 7 magnitudes below the main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) .",
    "a list of the gcs used in this study is shown in table  [ table : list ] along with their core radii ( r@xmath8 ) , half - mass radii ( r@xmath9 ) , central luminosity densities ( @xmath10 ) , and central concentration parameters ( c ) .",
    "these were taken directly from @xcite , with the exception of the core and half - mass radii .",
    "the latter quantities are given in parsecs and were calculated using the distance modulii and extinction corrections provided in @xcite .",
    "each cluster was centred in the acs field , which extends out to several core radii from the cluster centre in most cases .",
    "coordinates for the cluster centres were taken from @xcite .",
    "these authors found their centres by fitting a series of ellipses to the density distributions within the inner 2 of the cluster centre , and computing an average value .",
    ".list of globular clusters and their structural parameters [ table : list ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in equation  [ eqn : frac - bin ] , plotted as a function of stellar mass .",
    "[ fig : slopes ] ]    as shown in figure  [ fig : slopes ] , @xmath11 tends to systematically increase with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "the uncertainty for @xmath11 is the highest for the lowest mass bin ( ms5 in table  [ table : bestfit ] ) .",
    "this is because the photometric errors are the highest at these dim magnitudes .",
    "however , the errors are consistently at most @xmath5 10% of the width in magnitude of their corresponding mass bin .    in an attempt to improve upon these statistics ,",
    "we have also calculated reduced chi - squared values with added intrinsic dispersion for the relations for each mass bin .",
    "that is , for each mass bin we added a constant term to the uncertainty for each data point , found the uncertainty that yielded a reduced chi - squared of one , and looked at the subsequent effects on the uncertainties for the line of best - fit .",
    "based on this , we appear to be slightly over - estimating the uncertainties for the ms1 , ms2 and ms3 mass bins using our bootstrap approach , and slightly under - estimating them for the ms4 and ms5 bins .",
    "the change in the distribution of stellar masses as a function of the total cluster mass can be illustrated using pie charts , as shown in figure  [ fig : pie_charts ] . using the values for @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "provided in table  [ table : bestfit ] , we have generated pie charts for three total numbers of stars ( spanning all five mass bins ) , namely n@xmath13 = 10@xmath14 , 10@xmath2 , 10@xmath15 ( from top to bottom in figure  [ fig : pie_charts ] ) . as is clear , low - mass stars become more and more preferentially depleted with decreasing total cluster mass .    from top to bottom , the pie charts can be interpreted as depicting the evolution of the stellar mass function with increasing dynamical age .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the inverse of the half - mass relaxation time can be used as a proxy for the rate of two - body relaxation throughout the entire cluster .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time ranges from several million years to the age of the universe or longer , and is approximated by @xcite : @xmath16^{3/2}n^{1/2}[m / m_{\\odot}]^{-1/2 } years,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the half - mass radius ( i.e. the radius enclosing half the mass of the cluster ) , @xmath18 is the total number of stars within @xmath17 and @xmath19 is the average stellar mass .",
    "simulations have shown that @xmath17 changes by a factor of at most a few over the course of a cluster s lifetime @xcite .",
    "the gcs that comprise the acs sample show a range of masses spanning roughly 3 orders of magnitude ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath0 ) , and have comparably old ages ( @xmath5 10 - 12 gyrs ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , their half - mass radii typically differ by less than a factor of 2 ( see table  [ table : list ] ) .",
    "therefore , equation  [ eqn : t - rh ] suggests that the total cluster mass provides a rough proxy for the degree of dynamical evolution due to two - body relaxation . in other words ,",
    "the effects of two - body relaxation on the evolution of the stellar mass function should be the most pronounced in the least massive clusters in the acs sample ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . said another way , dynamical age increases with decreasing cluster mass .",
    "therefore , figure  [ fig : pie_charts ] shows that our results are consistent with the general picture that two - body relaxation is the cause of the observed depletion of low - mass stars in low - mass clusters , as opposed to some unknown feature of the star formation process .    .",
    "from top to bottom , the total number of stars used to generate each pie chart was 10@xmath14 , 10@xmath2 , and 10@xmath15 .",
    "darker pie slices correspond to more massive bins .",
    "the sequence of pie charts progressing from top to bottom effectively shows the evolution of the stellar mass function with increasing dynamical age .",
    "[ fig : pie_charts ] ]      in this section , we compare the results of our observational analysis to 268 monte carlo simulations for globular cluster evolution spanning a range of initial conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig : slopes - compare ] shows a comparison between all five @xmath11 values found from the observed mfs and the corresponding model @xmath11 values for every combination of initial conditions . as is clear , the agreement is excellent for nearly every combination of initial imf , concentration and virial radius .",
    "this was confirmed by our chi - squared values , and the probability that the observed and model @xmath11 s are drawn from the same distribution exceeded 64% for all comparisons .",
    "our results suggest that a kroupa imf ( i.e. @xmath20 in equation  [ eqn : kroupa ] ) typically gives the best agreement with the observations .",
    "every set of models with this imf yielded a probability greater than 93% that the observed and model @xmath11 s are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "our results also appear to be relatively insensitive to the initial concentration and virial radius .",
    "this agrees with what was found by @xcite and @xcite given the limited ranges we have explored for these parameters .",
    "values to the corresponding model @xmath11 values for every combination of initial conditions .",
    "the observed @xmath11 s are shown as solid circles , whereas the model @xmath11 s are shown as different symbols .",
    "each inset shows the model @xmath11 s for a different imf .",
    "starting at the upper right and rotating clockwise , the insets correspond to imf slopes ( in equation  [ eqn : kroupa ] ) of -0.4 , 0.0 , 0.4 , and 1.3 .",
    "the online version of this plot shows the model @xmath11 s either as open or coloured symbols which have been used to indicate different initial concentrations .",
    "the solid blue circles , solid red squares , solid green triangles , open black triangles , and open five - point stars correspond to initial concentrations ( w@xmath21 ) of 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 , 6.5 , and 7.0 , respectively .",
    "a small offset has been implemented for every stellar mass bin to indicate different initial virial radii , with the virial radius increasing from left to right .",
    "a horizontal line has also been included on every observed data point in order to indicate the width of the corresponding stellar mass bin .",
    "[ fig : slopes - compare ] ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new technique to quantify cluster - to - cluster variations in a large sample of observed stellar mass functions .",
    "our method quantifies these differences as a function of both the stellar mass and the total cluster mass , and offers the advantage that it is insensitive to the exact functional form of the mf .",
    "we have applied our technique to completeness - corrected stellar mass functions in the range 0.25 - 0.75 m@xmath0 for a sample of 27 globular clusters taken from the acs survey for gcs , and have compared the results to a series of monte carlo models for gc evolution .    in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the formation and evolution of milky way gcs .",
    "we have shown that the observed differences in the present - day mfs in our sample can be reproduced by assuming ( 1 ) an universal initial mass function for all clusters , and ( 2 ) that internal two - body relaxation is the dominant mechanism contributing to the cluster - to - cluster variations .",
    "our results are the most reliable in the mass range 0.45 - 0.75 m@xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the larger photometric errors at the fainter magnitudes corresponding to lower stellar masses , and incompleteness resulting from crowding . despite the high quality of the data used in this study",
    ", these issues are currently unavoidable given the nature of the observations .",
    "this will be a key challenge for future studies to resolve , however the method we have presented in this paper offers a robust means of performing future analyses .",
    "we note that the results of our observational analysis are consistent with those of @xcite , who fit a tapered power - law distribution function with an exponential truncation to the stellar mass functions of a sample of 30 clusters containing both young and old members .",
    "we have also verified that our results are consistent with those of @xcite , who performed power - law fits to the mfs of 17 gcs taken from the acs survey .    in this paper , we have focused on the _ local _ mfs in the central cluster regions of the gcs in our sample . however , previous studies have shown that the _ local _ mf can differ considerably from the _ global _ mf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle",
    ", this should not have affected our comparisons between the observed and simulated mfs since we have considered the same structural areas of the clusters in all cases .",
    "binary stars are unresolved in gcs , appearing as single objects located above the ms in the cluster cmd .",
    "therefore , we have included some objects in our number counts that are in fact binaries masquerading as single stars .",
    "previous studies have shown that unresolved binaries can contribute to flattening , or even inverting , the stellar mass function in the range of stellar masses considered in this paper ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , observational evidence suggests that the binary fractions in gcs are inversely proportional to the total cluster mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the most massive mw gcs tend to have binary fractions on the order of only a few percent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the least massive mw gcs tend to have larger binary fractions that can even exceed 50% in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that unresolved binaries should have had the largest effect on the mfs of the lowest mass clusters in our sample .",
    "therefore , unresolved binaries could also be contributing to the general trend we have found of increasing @xmath11 with decreasing stellar mass .    in an effort to quantify the effects of unresolved binaries on our results",
    ", we removed all binaries from our simulated mfs and re - performed our weighted lines of best - fit .",
    "this confirmed that unresolved binaries could indeed be contributing to the general trend we have found of increasing @xmath11 with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "however , this effect was not significant in the models , in large part because we assumed a constant initial global binary fraction of 10% for all clusters . in order to reproduce the observed trend in @xmath11",
    ", it would require that the range in binary fractions between low- and high - mass clusters is greater than the observed range by a factor @xmath3 2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the binary fractions generally increase in the core over time in our simulations ( see @xcite for more details ) , they are not sufficiently high to have significantly contributed to the trend of increasing @xmath11 with decreasing stellar mass . at the end of our simulations , the core binary fractions are typically in the range 10 - 30% .    in order to properly assess these effects , objects that are in fact unresolved binaries",
    "should be identified and our analysis of the observations should be re - performed .",
    "this could be done using multi - band photometry since , if a given binary happens to fall on a single star evolution track in one cmd , it is unlikely to fall on the corresponding tracks in other cmds constructed using different wavelength bands .",
    "stellar evolution models could then be used to constrain the masses of the component stars .",
    "we intend to address this issue in future work .",
    "we expect that the influence of binaries on gc evolution by , for example acting as heat - sources via hardening encounters with single stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should have had a negligible impact on our results .",
    "this is because most of the clusters in our sample should still be undergoing core contraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that their central densities have not yet become sufficiently high for encounters involving binaries to occur frequently enough that they could have significantly affected the cluster evolution .",
    "notwithstanding , future studies should incorporate models spanning a range of realistic initial binary fractions and distributions of orbital parameters in order to properly assess all of these effects .",
    "tides from the galaxy effectively reduce the time - scale on which two - body relaxation operates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this primarily serves to make clusters appear more dynamically evolved than they otherwise would .",
    "the same effect is caused by disc shocking which , as with tidal effects , should most severely affect clusters with the lowest masses and the smallest galactocentric distances .",
    "therefore , the locations of clusters within their host galaxies has been shown to play an important role in determining the degree of flattening of their stellar mfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in an effort to quantify the effects caused by tides on our observational results , we performed several cuts in perigalacticon distance and re - performed our weighted lines of best - fit .",
    "estimates for the perigalacticon distances were obtained from @xcite and @xcite for every cluster in our sample . despite removing clusters with small perigalacticon distances for which it is typically argued that tidal effects should be the most severe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our lines of best - fit remained the same .",
    "we caution that these effects have not been fully accounted for in the simulations of gc evolution performed in this paper , for which we adopted circular orbits and a galactocentric distance of 4 kpc in all cases .",
    "we intend to adopt a more realistic distribution of galactic orbits for our model clusters in a future paper in order to properly assess the effects caused by tides in determining the present - day mfs of the gcs in our observed sample .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the expulsion of primordial gas early on in the cluster lifetime can have a dramatic effect on the stellar mfs of clusters .",
    "in particular , these authors showed that clusters that began their lives with smaller concentrations are more likely to have lost a larger fraction of their low - mass stars as a result of this effect .",
    "primordial gas expulsion could therefore contribute to improving the agreement we have found between the observed and simulated mfs .",
    "this would be accomplished if our @xmath11 values for the models were simultaneously increased for low stellar masses and decreased for high stellar masses , as is evident from figure  [ fig : slopes - compare ] .",
    "this would occur if primordial gas expulsion had a more pronounced effect on the mfs of the lowest mass clusters in our sample .",
    "this is not unreasonable since the depth of the cluster potential increases with increasing cluster mass .",
    "given the very old ages and therefore low metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -2.28 - ( -0.37 ) ) of the clusters in our sample , our technique could potentially be used to better constrain the imfs of old massive star clusters and , more generally , star formation in the very early universe .",
    "this will be done in a forthcoming paper by considering a larger range of imfs and initial cluster conditions than we have considered here .",
    "finally , we wish to point out that the method we have presented can be generalized to compare any large sample of distribution functions .",
    "we intend to illustrate this in a future paper by using our technique to quantify cluster - to - cluster differences in the orbital distributions ( period , eccentricity , and mass - ratio ) of the binary populations in gcs as a function of the total cluster mass .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for several suggestions that helped to improve our manuscript .",

    "<S> we present a new technique to quantify cluster - to - cluster variations in the observed present - day stellar mass functions of a large sample of star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our method quantifies these differences as a function of both the stellar mass and the total cluster mass , and offers the advantage that it is insensitive to the precise functional form of the mass function . </S>",
    "<S> we applied our technique to data taken from the advanced camera for surveys survey for globular clusters , from which we obtained completeness - corrected stellar mass functions in the mass range 0.25 - 0.75 m@xmath0 for a sample of 27 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our observational analysis were then compared to monte carlo simulations for globular cluster evolution spanning a range of initial mass functions , total numbers of stars , concentrations , and virial radii .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the present - day mass functions of the clusters in our sample can be reproduced by assuming an universal initial mass function for all clusters , and that the cluster - to - cluster differences are consistent with what is expected from two - body relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete exploration of the initial cluster conditions will be needed in future studies to better constrain the precise functional form of the initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> this study is a first step toward using our technique to constrain the dynamical histories of a large sample of old galactic star clusters and , by extension , star formation in the early universe .    </S>",
