    "the development of secondary beam to produce unstable nuclei changed the common sense of nuclear physics , which had been accumulated over the years from the study of stable nuclei .",
    "the discovery of neutron halo and skin is one of the most famous ones .",
    "these observations changed the formula of the nuclear radius being proportional to a@xmath1 .",
    "new facilities are now planned and being constructed to get more unstable nuclei including those near the drip line .",
    "these new facilities would definitely bring us with more information and new phenomena for those unstable nuclei .",
    "in the theory side , various attempts were made to understand diverse phenomena with the unified frameworks .",
    "one of the powerful framework is the relativistic mean field theory(rmf )",
    "it is based on the relativistic many - body theory and is applied to many observables with great success .    in the rmf theory",
    ", it is very important to include the pairing interaction on the same footing as the particle - hole correlations .",
    "usually , it is implemented by the so - called bcs - type theory as in other mean field theory . in the bcs - type theory the pairing interaction is implemented by hand outside of the relativistic theory .",
    "however , we would like that the pairing interaction is described in the relativistic many - body theoretical manner within the rmf theory .",
    "one possibility toward this attempt is the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory(rhfb ) , which was formulated by kucharek et al @xcite .",
    "recently , the hartree - fock - bogoliubov(hfb ) theory is widely used in both the non - relativistic and relativistic mean field calculations .",
    "it can treat the usual mean field and the pairing field simultaneously .",
    "the hfb theory is applied to nuclear matter and finite nuclei , relativistically @xcite and non - relativistically @xcite with many interesting results .    however , until now the effect of the non - linear self - coupling terms of mesons are not considered in the pairing channel in the rhb theory . it is known that those non - linear terms are needed to reproduce the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei in the rmf theory @xcite .",
    "we can imagine that those terms have some effect on the pairing correlations .",
    "therefore , in this paper we would like to extend the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory to include the effect of the non - linear self coupling terms of mesons and apply it to nuclear matter to see the effect on the pairing gap @xmath2 .    in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we develop the formalism of the rhfb theory using the non - linear relativistic lagrangian under the harmonic approximation to handle the non - linear terms . in section  [ sec : result ] , this equation is solved with the parameter sets of tm1@xcite and nl1 @xcite . since these parameter sets were obtained in the rmf formulation , the fock term contribution is dropped in this paper .",
    "we study the form factor dependence on the pairing properties of the nuclear matter .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] is devoted to the summary of this paper .",

    "we introduce three types of meson fields @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath5 is the isoscalar - scalar field , which mediates medium range attraction between two nucleons .",

    "@xmath8 is the photon field , which produces the electromagnetic field . here ,",
    "@xmath9 is self coupling terms of the @xmath5 meson , @xmath10 boguta et al",
    ". investigated it extensively @xcite and found that it is needed to reproduce the nuclear matter and finite nucleus properties .",
    "we also include a non - linear coupling term of @xmath6 meson @xcite , which was investigated by sugahara et al . ,",
    "motivated by the recent success of the relativistic brckner - hartree - fock(rbhf ) theory@xcite .",
    "they found that it is needed to reproduce the rbhf result for the nuclear matter quantitatively up to the high density region . from this lagrangian",
    ", we can derive a dirac equation for nucleons and klein - gordon equations for bosons with the euler - lagrange equation . in the rmf theory",
    "we replace the meson fields with their classical mean values , @xmath11 however , in this approximation the terms which lead to the pairing interaction do not appear .",
    "these terms come from the terms like @xmath12 . to obtain these terms",
    "we need to take the higher order terms and fluctuation terms of the meson fields @xcite . here",
    "we explain our method which is somewhat different from kucharek et al . for brevity , we write down only the @xmath5 meson terms .",
    "the extension to include other mesons is straightforward .",
    "we write the quantized field as the sum of its classical field and its fluctuation , @xmath13 here , the classical mean value @xmath14 is obtained from the mean field equation , @xmath15 by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : divide ] ) into the relativistic lagrangian  ( [ eq : lag ] ) , we get , @xmath16 @xmath17 indicates the terms of more than @xmath18 orders .",

    "for the interaction part we use the gorkov method @xcite , which is used in the theory of superconductor , @xmath30 in the above equation , the first term vanishes because of the mean field equation ( [ eq : mfeq ] ) .",
    "the second term corresponds to the fock term and the last two terms are responsible for the pairing interaction .",
    "finally , we get a modified effective lagrangian of the form , @xmath31 in this lagrangian @xmath32 corresponds to the lagrangian of the rmf theory , @xmath33 with which we can reproduce the rmf theory .",

    "the only difference between kucharek et al .",
    "and ours is that in our formalism the masses of mesons in p - p channels are modified by non - linear terms of mesons .",

    "first , we neglect the dirac sea as usually done in the rmf theory .",
    "second , we neglect the fock term appeared in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lint ] ) as usual because our aim is to check the effect of the non - linear terms of mesons on the pairing channel .",
    "third , we take into account only the @xmath49 pairing , which is the most important one in both nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",

    "@xmath41 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath53 is the interaction term of the pairing channel . as for the precise form of @xmath53 ,",
    "see kucharek et al @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the form factor for each vertex , @xmath54 to cut out the effect of the high momentum region . without the cut - off",
    ", we get unreasonably large pairing gap @xcite . in this work we use the cut - off parameter @xmath55 , @xmath56mev for @xmath5 , @xmath57mev for @xmath6 and @xmath58mev for @xmath7 .",
    "these form factors correspond to those of bonn c @xcite .",
    "we note that there is large cut - off dependence of the value of the pairing gap . however , we find that the overall tendency is not changed",
    ". the actual form of @xmath59 is plotted in fig  [ fig : vpp ] . in this figure",
    ", we also plot the components of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson exchanges .",
    "we use the tm1 parameter set @xcite . from this figure",
    ", we see that the large attraction of @xmath5 and the large repulsion of @xmath6 cancel out each other and the relatively week interaction in the lower momentum region is realized .",
    "it is one of the characteristic feature of the rmf theory .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_tm1 ] we show the pairing gap at the fermi momentum @xmath60 @xmath61 as a function of the density measured in the fermi momentum .",
    "we use the parameter set tm1 , which has both @xmath5 non - linear coupling and @xmath6 non - linear coupling terms @xcite . in this figure , `` nl''(solid line )",
    "denotes the case when we use the formalism in the previous section to include the non - linear term effect on the pairing channel and `` l''(dashed line ) means the case with the use of the raw mass @xmath26 , @xmath62 for the mass parameters in the propagators of mesons instead of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : propa ] ) ) . from this figure",
    "we see that the pairing gap is reduced by a few mev by including the non - linear term of mesons .",
    "this effect is especially large around @xmath60 = 1.0 @xmath61 .",
    "only the difference between two cases is the mass terms in the propagator of mesons . in our formalism , by including the non - linear term effect the masses of mesons in the propagator are modified with the medium effect . to see it , we plot @xmath63 ( solid line ) and @xmath64 ( dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_tm1 ] . at lower density",
    "both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are not much different from their original values , @xmath26 and @xmath62 , because the densities are low , medium effect is not large in this region .",
    "however , at higher density , they are larger than their original values .",
    "these results come from the non - linear terms in the expressions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( eq .  ( [ eq : musigma ] ) ) .",
    "those effects are more significant at higher density . because the mass terms in the propagator are more massive at higher density region , the interaction in the pairing channel",
    "is reduced . to see that in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpp ] we compare the value of @xmath59 at the density @xmath60 = 0.78 @xmath61 , which corresponds to the maximum point of @xmath65 without the non - linear term effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_tm1 ] .",
    "we see that by introducing the non - linear term effect , @xmath59 is reduced . hence ,",
    "pairing gaps are reduced .",
    "of course , those effects depend on the value of coupling constant",
    ". however , at normal density the general forms of non - linear terms are not so different between the parameter sets which are widely used .",
    "so , we can find the same tendency ; namely , the reduction of pairing gap with each parameter set at moderate density .",
    "we study the effect of the form factor by changing the cut - off mass slightly . with the use of @xmath662200mev , @xmath671900mev , @xmath68=1700mev , the pairing gap increases",
    "largely as shown in fig  [ fig : delta_check ] .",
    "the peak position , however , does not change much from the previous choice of the parameters . these cut - off masses in the corresponding form factors are related with the structure of hadrons in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is certainly an interesting future subject to fix these values on theoretical ground .    for comparison",
    "we show @xmath65 for the case of the nl1 @xcite parameter set in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_nl1 ] .",
    "nl1 has the non - linear term of only @xmath5 meson .",
    "it does not have those of @xmath6 meson .",
    "we can see that the same effect appears as in the case with tm1",
    ". however , at higher density @xmath65 get abnormally large values .",
    "( it is not shown in the figure . )",
    "this is due to the minus sign of the coupling constant of the quadratic self - coupling term .",
    "because of this negative sign , at higher density @xmath63 is getting smaller and smaller with density . hence",
    ", the pairing interaction becomes very large and the pairing gap becomes very large at high densities . in the tm1 case , because @xmath69 has positive sign this effect does not occur .",
    "nevertheless , we can find the same tendency in the moderate mass region .",
    "we have developed a new framework to incorporate non - linear terms of mesons in pairing channel in the rhfb theory . we have applied the rhb theory to nuclear matter to study the effect of non - linear terms on the p - p channel .",
    "we have found that the non - linear terms reduce @xmath2 at fermi momentum especially for normal density region .",
    "it is caused by non - linear term effect on the mass parameter in the meson propagator .",
    "the pairing interaction is reduced due to the non - linear coupling terms .",
    "this effect is neglected in other works .",
    "we have found that it has a non - negligible effect .",
    "it is interesting to apply it to asymmetric nuclear matter and finite nuclei .    in this paper",
    "we have used the parameter sets determined in the rmf framework ; i.e. , tm1 and nl1 .",
    "as seen in the formalism , the pairing correlations in nuclear matter are caused by the fluctuations of the meson fields .",
    "hence , it is very natural to take the fock term when we consider the pairing correlations .",
    "it then needs an elaborate work to complete our program as to first fix the parameters of the relativistic lagrangian in the hartree - fock framework from various magic number nuclei and then to calculate the pairing properties of nuclear matter .",
    "we start this program to be worked out in due time .",
