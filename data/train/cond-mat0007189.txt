    "the standard description of electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) in metals is based on the  so - called born - oppenheimer @xcite ( or adiabatic ) theorem .",
    "its main statement says that electrons are not sensitive to the  motion of ions and are influenced only by their static electric field .",
    "one can to say that ",
    "fast  electrons , due to electroneutrality , follow  slow  ions .",
    "narrow bands and a  strong electron - phonon interaction make their velocities comparable in order of magnitude . an appropriate mathematical description is the  standard feynman - dyson perturbation theory , where phonons are considered to be uneffected by the  epi .",
    "however , there are some processes which in higher orders violate this approximation .",
    "mathematically this can be taken into account by virtue of the so - called  vertex corrections  .",
    "these effects were considered by migdal @xcite who showed that their contributions are small ,  of the order of a small parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a characteric energy , defined by the bandwidth @xmath2 or the   fermi energy @xmath3 .",
    "it was noted by migdal himself @xcite that at @xmath4 the  vertex corrections are not small ( so they are important for optical conductivity and raman scattering ) .",
    "this case was considered in detail by engelsberg and schrieffer @xcite .",
    "migdal s theorem is also violated for a one - dimensional fermi surface @xcite .",
    "traditionally nonadiabatic corrections were considered to be small because the migdal parameter @xmath5 was small @xcite .",
    "but recently some materials ( for example , fullerenes and high-@xmath6 superconductors ) where @xmath7 were discovered .",
    "so migdal s theorem about the smallness of the nonadiabatic corrections @xcite can be violated .",
    "this gives grounds for not only discussing these corrections , but even examining an antiadiabatic limit @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "but even with small @xmath5 there are contradictory conclusions about the importance of such corrections in the normal and superconducting state ( the authors of refs.@xcite consider them to be negligible , while the authors of @xcite think the opposite is true ) .",
    "the most intriguing question is whether the violation of adiabaticity leads to an increase of the interelectron interaction ( and , as a result , to an increase of @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are contradictory results about the effect of the vertex corrections on @xmath6 .",
    "for example , takada @xcite reported some increase of @xmath6 for small parameters @xmath9 .",
    "even more significant increase was claimed in @xcite . at the same time , in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite a decrease of @xmath6 was obtained  due to the vertex corrections .",
    "one can distinguish between the   two sorts of the nonadiabatic corrections to the electron self - energy : 1 ) the vertex ones , resulted from the higher order corrections of perturbation theory , as vertex function @xmath10 even at an infinite electron ( or hole ) band @xmath11 @xcite , and 2 ) the corrections due to the  finite band width ,  @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "nonadiabatic corrections in the superconducting state enter the expression for @xmath6 in two ways : indirectly through renormalization of @xmath13 and directly in the equation for the order parameter @xmath14 . at the same time",
    ", analytical calculation of anomalous ( crossing ) diagrams is rather difficult .",
    "therefore before proceeding to calculations in the superconducting state we want to clarify the role of such corrections in the normal state .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to compare different approaches to calculation of nonadiabatic corrections to the electron quasiparticle self - energy in the normal state ( or more precisely to the mass renormalization factor @xmath13 ) .",
    "there are two methods to take nonadiabatic corrections into account .",
    "one of them , which can be called migdal s one , is based on the solution to the bethe - salpeter equation for the vertex function @xcite in the ladder approximation . in the lowest approximation , the first correction to the unity vertex is determined by the diagram in fig.1 .",
    "then with the obtained vertex function the self - energy @xmath15 is calculated @xcite .",
    "this traditional method does not allow to take into account higher - order diagrams analytically because of complexity of the  integration over momenta .    in 1989",
    "the  authors of the ref.@xcite considered a  non - ladder approximation , using the ward identity .",
    "later y.  takada used the same idea in his method @xcite , which he called the gauge - invariant self - consistent ( gisc ) method . in this method , based on the ward identity @xcite    @xmath16",
    "the vector term is neglected and the scalar vertex function is chosen to be a functional of the self - energy , which is supposed to be independent from momentum . recently there appeared another method @xcite , aiming at improving the gisc approach as it takes into account the  momentum dependence of the vertex function .",
    "so , when comparing these methods with the  migdal s one , we also discuss the  validity of these assumptions .",
    "in fact , for the self - energy we calculate all the diagrams up to , and including the second order .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is taken to be small .    for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the model of the fermi liquid with the usual electron - phonon hamiltonian @xcite and einstein phonon @xcite spectrum with the  so - called eliashberg spectral function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the phonon frequency independent from momentum , and @xmath20 is the electron - phonon interaction constant .",
    "it is assumed that the density of states is constant @xmath21 for @xmath12 where @xmath22 is the bandwidth .",
    "the chemical potential is zero , which corresponds to a half - filled band .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath23 .",
    "we are interested in the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath15 on the imaginary axis which is determined by the diagram in fig.1 .",
    "the phonon green s function is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , and the electron green s function is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the bare electron spectrum .",
    "the vertex function itself ( two - point one ) is only of academic interest .",
    "we are , however , interested in the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath15 which affects many physical observables . assuming that @xmath29 weakly depends on @xmath30",
    ", we take @xmath31 , and then @xmath32    the methods differ in the choice of the vertex function @xmath33 , and this will be discussed later .",
    "one should note that @xmath34 enters the integral for @xmath15 , and all @xmath35 s contribute to it . for simplicity we will obtain results for @xmath36 and the variables",
    "will be  changed as follows : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , remaining on the imaginary axis .",
    "in the method which can be called migdal s , the first correction to the unity vertex function @xmath39 is considered .",
    "this is shown in fig1 .",
    "it has been estimated in many papers @xcite , but now it is becoming especially significant @xcitebecause the cases were found where  as the parameter @xmath40 may be not small .",
    "the diagram in fig.1 corresponds to the expression    @xmath41    assuming that @xmath42 and expanding @xmath43 we get for @xmath36    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "this is a nonanalytical function at @xmath49 , @xmath50 , i.e. the result depends on the order of taking the limits .",

    "one can see that there is a good agreement between these plots , so the expansion in small @xmath59 is well justified .",
    "the self - energy ( [ eq1 ] ) consists then of three terms :    @xmath63    the first order term is @xcite @xmath64    the vertex correction @xmath65 is obtained when one substitutes @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( [ eq4 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] )    @xmath68    @xmath69 @xmath45 , @xmath48 , @xmath70 .",

    "the existing discrepancy for larger frequencies is due to our approximation for @xmath33 .",
    "another term is the so - called rainbow diagram .",
    "as the inner part of the rainbow diagram corresponds to @xmath79 , the second order rainbow diagram equals    @xmath80 ^ 2 \\sigma^{(1)}(i\\omega_n - i\\omega_{\\nu } ) ,   \\label{eqd05}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which results in    @xmath81    @xmath82    at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , it equals @xmath83    for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath84 one can get    @xmath85 one can see that the last expression has three terms with different denominators .",

    "are shown for comparison analytical and numerical plots for the self energy correction @xmath88 .",
    "it is seen that the approximation used to calculate the correction is well justified .",
    "if one assumes @xmath89 , @xmath90    one can see that these corrections lower the renormalization function .",
    "had  this tendency persist in all higher orders , this would have  resulted in an  instability ( see below ) .",
    "following the  paper@xcite , the authors  of ref.@xcite neglected the  momentum dependence of the vertex function , considering @xmath91 , and interpolated it between zero - frequency and infinite - frequency limits :    @xmath92    where @xmath93 , and @xmath94    this results in an effective interaction    @xmath95    combined with the contribution from the rainbow diagram , which is the same as in the migdal method ( [ sigma_r ] ) , this gives    @xmath96    the non - ladder approximation which was also discussed in @xcite was developed in detail by takada , and this is considered below .",
    "there has been a series of papers , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered the  effect of the  vertex corrections on @xmath6 not only for an isotropic epi , but also for spin ( antiferromagnetic ) fluctuations with a pronounced scattering at the wave vector @xmath97 . in the paper",

    "( [ 592 ] ) , but has a different numerical coefficient , due to neglecting the @xmath35-dependence in the vertex function ( [ 418 ] ) .",
    "in the paper @xcite the authors started with the same equation as in migdal method , but made a series of approximate assumptions ( for example , expanded in small @xmath109 s to take integrals ) and gave the following estimate for the vertex function :    @xmath113\\arctan \\frac{q}{m }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -[q - m\\arctan \\frac{q}{m}]\\frac{(\\frac{1}{m_{0}}+1)[(\\frac{1}{m_{0}}% + 1)^{2}+2m^{2}]}{[(\\frac{1}{m_{0}}+1)^{2}+m^{2}]^{2}}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here they set one of the external electronic frequencies to zero . in this case",
    "this result is similar to that in the  migdal s approximation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "however , to calculate @xmath15 one needs dependences on both external frequencies .",
    "there are some indications ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that for a  small hole doping strong coulomb correlations renormalize the epi , giving rise to the strong forward ( small-@xmath109 ) scattering peak , while the backward scattering is strongly suppressed .",

    "probably this is due to the  expansion in small @xmath109 s .",

    "so in takada s method the correction @xmath133 does not have the  small parameter @xmath134 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the region @xmath55 where @xmath135 gives in fact a small contribution to @xmath15 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath57 , the vertex @xmath33 is of the order of @xmath136 , which gives @xmath137 ( see ( [ 591 ] ) ) .    to explain this result , one can find the vector vertex function @xmath138 in the lowest approximation and show that it really can not be neglected .",

    "if one uses at @xmath75 the expression ( [ eq4 ] ) for @xmath147 , one can find that the terms @xmath148 and @xmath149 from ( [ eq1.5 ] ) are of the same order if @xmath150 .",
    "if , however , @xmath151 , the vector term dominates and can not be neglected .",
    "taking into account a  criticism of the gisc method @xcite , f. cosenza , l. de cesare , and m. fusco girard @xcite tried to improve the  gisc method and did not neglect the vector term in the ward identity .",
    "they employed the simplest choice of the solution to the ward identity @xcite    @xmath152}{% ( i\\omega _ { n^{\\prime } } -i\\omega _ { n})^{2}-|\\alpha ( \\vec{k},\\vec{k^{\\prime } } % ) |^{2}|\\vec{k}-\\vec{k^{\\prime } } |^{2 } } ,   \\label{cdg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath153 . with @xmath154 taken from eq.([s1 ] ) one gets for @xmath155    @xmath156 which is different from the migdal s estimation @xcite @xmath157 ( see ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .",
    "substituting approximation ( [ cdg ] ) into the equation for the self - energy ( [ eq1 ] ) one can get @xmath158 which is different from ( [ 591 ] ) and gives @xmath159    this can be explained by the fact that the ward identity is a  one equation for two functions ( the scalar and vector vertex functions ) and thus allows for multiple solutions @xcite .",
    "so there is no particular preference in using ( [ cdg ] ) instead of any other solution .",
    "[ seresultspage ]    so in the paper we considered consistently the contribution of nonadiabatic effects to the electron self - energy in the normal state at @xmath36 in second orders of the epi constant @xmath20 .",
    "several methods of taking into account nonadiabatic corrections were compared which can be summarized in the table ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the results following from the approximations of v. n. kostur and b. mitrovi @xcite , e. cappelluti , c. grimaldi , l. pietronero , and s. strssler @xcite give correct estimations of the order of magnitude and sign of the nonadiabatic corrections to the self - energy .",
    "the analytical results were compared with numerical calculations .",
    "it is shown that the gisc method @xcite and its generalization @xcite give for the self - energy overestimated and underestimated results respectively .",
    "this is connected with the fact that the leading contribution to @xmath15 comes from  the region @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "this means that in the ward identity one may not neglect the vector term as proposed by takada . in the framework of the standard ( migdal s )",
    "approach , in the lowest order , there is a calculable   parameter @xmath163 ( the ratio of the frequency of an incoming phonon to its momentum ) for which the contributions of the vector and scalar terms become of the same order .",
    "they are equal when @xmath164 .",
    "so for the  most metals , where the main contribution to the self energy comes from the region @xmath165 , the gisc method may not be applied .",
    "one should also be careful when choosing a  solution of the ward identity , so  as not to underestimate the scalar term , like in ref .",
    "it seems that gisc method can work in systems with long range interaction , for example , in doped semiconductors .",
    "the difference in the renormalization factors @xmath13 in the table are due with the different approximations used in the calculations of the momentum and frequency dependence of vertex function .",
    "we can illustrate this in fig .",
    "3 where we represent the results for @xmath166 in the takada s ( @xmath109-independent )",
    "approximation@xcite , the migdal approach for different @xmath109 ( eqs .",
    "( 4,27 ) of the present paper ) , and the @xmath109-independent kostur , mitrovi vertex function .",
    "we see that if the former overestimates the vertex corrections , the latter underestimates them .    for a stable system",
    "the condition @xmath167 for @xmath168 must be satisfied @xcite ( it is equivalent to @xmath169 ) .",
    "however , as one can see from the table , the nonadiabatic corrections reduce  the renormalization function @xmath13 , favoring the tendency towards instability .",
    "the critical @xmath170 at which it takes place ( see eqs .",
    "( 10 - 16 ) ) is given by    @xmath171 for @xmath172 , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 were defined above .",
    "the dependence of @xmath20 on the parameter @xmath134 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "thus , for a stable system there are constraints on @xmath175 for a fixed migdal parameter@xcite .",
    "this can explain , for example , the existence of pbbi with @xmath176 .",
    "at the same time , in some papers , e.g. @xcite , it is stated that @xmath23 independently from the  migdal parameter . as one sees from , it may be the case only for @xmath177 .",
    "this possible violation of the  analytical properties of the  one - particle green s function could result in corresponding nonanaliticity of the   two - particle green s function , and thus in a charge response function .",
    "this can lead to a charge instability .",
    "it follows from our analysis that different approximations to the vertex function give in the normal state quantitatively ( and sometimes even qualitatively ! ) different estimates  for the  self - energy .",
    "this makes the  conclusions of these theories doubtful , as the same approaches were used there to calculate @xmath6 in the superconducting state .",
    "this means that only direct migdal - type calculations can give an answer to the question : do nonadiabatic effects enhance critical temperature of the superconducting transition ?",
