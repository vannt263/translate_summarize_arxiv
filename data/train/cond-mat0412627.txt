    "the hubbard model appears in almost all areas of solid state physics .",
    "its universality is connected with the fact that it describes both band movement of charges as well as local and nonlocal  in the extended model ",
    "correlations  @xcite . treating its parameters as effective ones ,",
    "the model has been used in research of magnetism , superconductivity and especially high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) , other various phenomena in the solid , charge orderings , phase separation etc .",
    ", in materials like high temperature superconductors , bismuthates , chevrel phases , amorphous semiconductors , heavy fermion materials , systems with alternating valence to name the few ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately there are not many exact results concerning this model .",
    "usually the results are obtained in specific limits : infinite dimensions , one dimension ( the most numerous group ) , infinite repulsion , half - filled band or other specific band fillings .",
    "we can mention the exact solution in one dimension ( @xmath0 ) obtained by bethe ansatz  @xcite , lieb s ferrimagnetism  @xcite , nagaoka ferromagnetism in repulsive , half - filled systems with one hole  @xcite , flat band ferromagnetism  @xcite , some bounds on correlation functions  @xcite and a finding of randeria  @xcite , according to which , existence of two - electron bound states of s - wave symmetry is necessary and sufficient condition for appearance of s - wave superconductivity in @xmath1 systems with low electron density .",
    "let s also note that the mean - field bcs equations for superconductivity in the hubbard model with effective attractive interaction between electrons , in the limit of vanishing electron density turn into schrodinger equations , which can also be solved exactly  @xcite .",
    "a phase diagram in two dimensions for arbitrary @xmath2 , a case of special interest due to the possible connection with high temperature superconductivity , is still under examination .",
    "the results obtained in the mean - field approximation show competition of phases : in half - filled band charge density waves ( cdw ) for @xmath3 , superconductivity for @xmath4 and spin density waves for @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the calculations for @xmath6 suggest possibility of phase separation for @xmath4  @xcite : electron droplets for large enough @xmath7 and phase separation of cdw ( with @xmath8 ) with ss for @xmath9 ( ps[cdw / ss ] ) , for @xmath2 around half - filled band competing with the pure ss state in low density limit .",
    "this paper shows , how the known solutions for the bound states ( including exact solutions of schrodinger equation ) can be used for modification of the ground state phase diagram of the extended hubbard model .",
    "we begin with the extended hubbard hamiltonian in standard notation : @xmath10 where we sum over nearest - neighbors ( nn ) sites only . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are treated as effective parameters .",
    "we use broken - symmetry hartree - fock approach ( for details see ref .",
    "as we are interested in the properties of the superconducting state , we introduce averages of operators @xmath13 in wicks - type decoupling  @xcite of the four - operator terms in the hamiltonian",
    ". non - zero average of such pair - creating operators means phase - coherence among pairs , i.e. a presence of superconducting state , and serves as an order parameter ( see eq .",

    "( [ ham2 ] ) can be expressed now as : @xmath28 the pairing potential in the singlet channel ( see eq .",
    "( [ dq ] ) ) takes on the separable form for the square lattice and nn interaction : @xmath29 ( retaining only the terms of s - wave symmetry ) , and that makes possible solving eq .",
    "( [ dq ] ) by an ansatz : @xmath30 what leads us to the set of self - consistent equations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in the case of the rectangular density of states ( dos ) and pure on - site pairing",
    "we can obtain analytical solutions  @xcite ; in the case of the extended s - wave superconductivity ( eqs  ( [ delta0 ] )  ( [ n ] ) ) analytical solutions exist in the limit of low electron density . introducing a new parameter : @xmath33 , we can expand eqs  ( [ delta0 ] )  ( [ n ] ) , treating @xmath34 as a small parameter . as a result",
    "we obtain a formula for critical value for appearance of superconductivity for given @xmath11 and @xmath2 in the ground state  @xcite : @xmath35 and @xmath36 is half - bandwidth unit . in the case of rectangular dos",
    "this formula reduces to  @xcite : @xmath37 we can go a step further in our mean - field analysis and include fock term @xmath38 into calculations . in eqs  ( [ ham2 ] ) , ( [ eq ] ) , ( [ delta0 ] )  ( [ n ] )",
    ", @xmath39 must be changed into @xmath40 then , and we have to solve eqs  ( [ delta0 ] )  ( [ n ] ) self consistently with the equation for the fock term : @xmath41 . equations ( [ wcrmy ] )  ( [ wcrmysq ] ) remain valid , with the change @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath11 .",

    "( [ ham ] ) ) .",
    "we can easily find the equations for the coefficients of the expansion , what finally yields a set of self - consistent equations for the wave function in the position space , in terms of lattice green functions  @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is lattice green function defined by : @xmath48 and @xmath49 is diagonal interaction matrix , consisting of elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "this is an exact result .",
    "remembering that @xmath58 is divergent for lattices of dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 we can see , that for @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( eq .  ( [ wcrmy ] ) ) and eq .",
    "( [ wcrex ] ) is a limiting value of the formula eqs  ( [ wcrmy ] ) and ( [ wcrmysq ] ) for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as it should be . not for @xmath62",
    "though ; this case will be discussed later on .",
    "let s note that eqs  ( [ wcrmy ] ) , ( [ wcrmysq ] ) and ( [ wcrex ] ) , are valid for any combination of signs of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and for large enough @xmath4 and @xmath7 there is a second branch of solutions  @xcite .",
    "the two branches are the two solutions which realize in the two opposite limits : @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) .",
    "the formal equations and their solutions in both these limits are the same , despite completely different physical situation",
    ". nevertheless these are the specific cases of two distinct solutions .",
    "in view of the randeria s notice , described in the introduction , in the case of s - wave symmetry in two dimensions we can use condition for existence of bound states as a condition for existence of superconductivity . in fig .",
    "1 the boundaries expressed by eq .  ( [ wcrmy ] ) for different lattice dimensionalities and electron densities are shown . for parameters",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 belonging to the area above the plotted lines ( mostly in the 1st quarter of coordinate system ) two - electron bound states , and what follows s - wave superconductivity in two dimensions , can not exist .",
    "the curves for @xmath66 in all dimensions are exact results .",
    "as @xmath2 gets larger , the area of existence of bound pairs increases for @xmath9 and @xmath4 and decreases in the part of the diagram with @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "all curves except the one for @xmath66 in @xmath62 go through the point with coordinates @xmath67 .",
    "this illustrates the fact that for @xmath55 infinitesimally small @xmath11 creates bound state in @xmath1 , while the threshold exists in @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless we do not have threshold in @xmath62 for @xmath68  in agreement with randeria s notion about necessity of bound states for superconductivity only in @xmath1 .",
    "let s note that for large @xmath11 and @xmath12 the curves approach the asymptotes  for curves crossing through the axes origin the asymptotes are given by the formulas : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this is connected with the fact that in the 3rd quarter of the coordination system for @xmath4 and @xmath7 there exist second branches of the solutions . as they have higher energy than the solutions described in fig .",
    "1 they do not modify the ground state phase diagram and are not shown here .    the dotted line in fig .  1 ( and in fig",
    "2 ) describes the results of calculations with inclusion of the fock term , using eq .",
    "( [ wcrmysq ] ) modified by the @xmath71 term , as was described in the end of section  2 . to simplify the calculations the fock term from the normal state",
    "was used : @xmath72 . for @xmath9",
    "this term broadens the band moving the system more into weak coupling limit and enlarging the normal state area ( opposite behavior for @xmath7 ) .",
    "the same effect can be seen in fig .  2 .    in fig .",
    "2 the boundaries of existence of bound states , eq .  ( [ wcrmysq ] ) ( black symbols ) , are plotted on a ground state phase diagram of the extended hubbard model for @xmath4 and @xmath9 , for arbitrary @xmath2 and rectangular dos , together with the phase boundary ps[cdw / ss]/ss taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( white symbols ) . above the lines with black symbols",
    "s - wave superconductivity can not exist in @xmath1 . this way the superconducting state is suppressed and normal state (",
    "no ) area is introduced into the phase diagram .",
    "let s note that also the phase separated state ps[cdw / ss ] is `` reduced '' to the no phase and not to the cdw phase .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cdw in the ps state is the cdw with @xmath8 .",
    "cdw with @xmath6 is unstable , as it has negative compressibility .",
    "another thing to note is the threshold for appearance of bound states for @xmath66 , which increases with increasing @xmath73 .",
    "the phase diagram is modified only for intermediate values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , smaller from their asymptotic values @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for @xmath73 or @xmath74 larger than these values ,",
    "bound states exist for arbitrary value of the other parameter , in agreement with fig .  1 .    the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite consider only pure , on - site s - wave pairing .",
    "including @xmath77 ( eq .  ( [ delta1 ] ) ) into calculations does not change much the described ps[cdw / ss]/ss boundary ",
    "@xmath77 is two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath34 on this boundary .",
    "inclusion of fock term into the calculations of the bound states , results in extending the area of the normal phase , as was mentioned before .",
    "this effect increases with increasing @xmath78 and @xmath12 .    in conclusion",
    "it was shown , how the analytical ( and exact for @xmath66 ) formulas for bound two - electron states can be used for the modification of the @xmath4 , @xmath9 part of the phase diagram of the extended hubbard model .",
    "the main result of this approach is suppression of the superconducting and phase separated areas in favor of the normal phase around half - filled band for intermediate values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , larger than threshold values and smaller than @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
