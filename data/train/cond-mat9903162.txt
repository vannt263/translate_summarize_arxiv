    "transition - metal oxides are known as a large class of materials where the band width and the carrier density can be controlled by cation substitutions .",
    "they exhibit various physical properties , _",
    "e.g. _ , ferroelectricity , magnetism and superconductivity . since the discovery of the high - temperature superconductors , transition - metal oxides have attracted renewed interest , and a number of new materials and new phenomena",
    "have been discovered in the past decade .",
    "the search for new thermoelectric ( te ) materials has also come to a new stage where ternary or quarternary compounds are extensively examined @xcite .",
    "a filled skutterudite is a prime example of the newly discovered te materials @xcite .",
    "very recently we discovered that a layered oxide naco@xmath0o@xmath1 shows large thermopower and low resistivity , whose power factor is comparable to that for bi@xmath0te@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is a possible candidate for a te transition - metal oxide .",
    "naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is an old material , which was synthesized in 1970 s @xcite , even though the metallic conduction has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the schematic view of the oxygen network of the coo@xmath0 block in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "edge - shared distorted octahedra ( and co in the center of them ) form a triangular lattice .",
    "na cations and coo@xmath0 blocks alternately stack along the @xmath2 axis to make a layered structure .",
    "a characteristic feature is that the mobility for naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is ten times smaller than that for bi@xmath0te@xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the carrier density for naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is ten times larger , implying that small carrier density is not an origin for the large thermopower .",
    "hence there should be another mechanism to cause large thermopower , and the elucidation of the conduction mechanism in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 may give a new principle to design te materials .",
    "here we report the measurements of the various transport parameters of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals , and discuss the anomalous conduction mechanism quantitatively .",
    "single crystals of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared by a nacl - flux technique with al@xmath0o@xmath3 crucibles .",
    "the as - grown crystals were washed in water to remove the nacl flux .",
    "the crystals were thin along the @xmath2 axis with a typical dimension of 1.5@xmath41.5@xmath40.02 mm@xmath5 .",
    "transport parameters were measured only along the in - plane direction , since the crystals were very thin along the out - of - plane direction .",
    "thermopower was measured in the configuration where one edge of the sample was pasted on a sapphire plate with the other pasted on a sheet heater . temperature ( @xmath6 ) was monitored by two diode thermometers attached on the edges .",
    "the contribution of copper leads was carefully subtracted .",
    "transverse magnetoresistance and the hall coefficient were measured in sweeping field ( @xmath7 ) from 0 to 8 t using an ac - bridge nano - ohm - meter ( linear research lr201 ) .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the resistivity ( @xmath8 ) of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "the magnitude of resistivity ranges from 200 to 600 @xmath9 cm at 300 k , which is possibly due to the uncontrollable disorder or nonstoichiometry of the na content .",
    "we observed that @xmath8 of polycrystalline na@xmath10co@xmath0o@xmath1 , monotonically increases with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath8 , the thermopower ( @xmath12 ) is less sensitive to the crystal quality [ fig .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitude of @xmath12 ( 100 @xmath13v / k at 300 k ) is one - order - of - magnitude larger than conventional metals . as is often observed in conventional metals ,",
    "@xmath12 is roughly proportional to @xmath6 , which is consistent with the fact that @xmath8 exhibits metallic conduction from room temperature down to 1.5 k.    the hall coefficient ( @xmath14 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath14 at 4.2 k is 2@xmath410@xmath15 cm@xmath5/c , corresopnding to the carrier density of 10@xmath17 cm@xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that naco@xmath0o@xmath1 has ten times larger carrier density than bi@xmath0te@xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath14 shows the opposite sign to @xmath12 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the electronic states can not be understood by a simple parabolic band picture .",
    "another feature is the remarkable @xmath6 dependence . in conventional metals",
    ", @xmath19 is proportional to the carrier density ( or density of states at the fermi energy ) , and is independent of @xmath6 in the lowest - order approximation .",
    "figure 4 shows the transverse magnetoresistance ( mr ) , where negative mr is observed at 4.2 k. as @xmath6 is lowered , positive mr ( roughly proportional to @xmath20 ) overlaps with the negative mr .",
    "a possible origin for the negative mr is weak localization or scattering by spin fluctuation . considering that the metallic conduction continues down to 1.55 k ( see the inset of fig .  4 ) ,",
    "the former is unlikely to occur .",
    "magnetic measurements have shown that spin fluctuation may exist in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the susceptibility of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 shows curie - weiss - like @xmath6 dependence @xcite , and the knight shifts of the na and co sites show different @xmath6 dependence @xcite .",
    "we further note that @xmath8 depends on @xmath6 even below 4.2 k , which indicates that the carriers are not scattered by ordinary phonons .",
    "as is seen in the previous section , the large thermopower , the @xmath6-dependent hall coefficient , and the negative magnetoresistance are difficult to explain by a conventional picture based on the band theory and the electron - phonon scattering .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that , like high-@xmath21 superconductors , the strong electron correlation is important in the electric conduction in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we can expect that the strong correlation enhances @xmath22 under certain conditions .",
    "since the diffusive part of @xmath12 corresponds to the transport entropy @xcite , larger electronic specific heat can give larger @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath12 would be enhanced if the carriers could couple with some outside entropy such as optical phonon , spin fluctuation , or orbital fluctuation .",
    "a similar scenario has been applied to heavy fermions or valence - fluctuation systems , some of which show large @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath8 and @xmath12 of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is , at least qualitatively , consistent with the theories of 2d metals with spin fluctuation by moriya , takahashi and ueda @xcite and by miyake and narikiyo @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the half of the na sites are randomly vacant , that is , the na layer is highly disordered .",
    "thus the mean free path ( mfp ) of phonons will be as short as the lattice spacing , which means that the lattice thermal conductivity is minimized .",
    "in fact , the thermal conductivity of polycrystalline naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is as small as that of bi@xmath0te@xmath3 , and it is hardly affected by cation substitutions @xcite .    on the other hand , electric conduction is determined by the coo@xmath0 block that includes little disorder . in low - dimensional correlated metals ,",
    "the carriers are often confined in the conducting region , and are hardly affected by outside disorder .",
    "this is known as the `` confinement '' @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the electric conduction remains considerably good , together with the minimized lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "in other words , mfp of carriers can be much longer than mfp of phonons in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we propose that strongly correlated layered conductors are promising as new te materials , in the sense that lattice thermal current and electric current can flow in different paths in the crystal . in this context",
    "we may call them a new type of ` electron crystals and phonon glasses ' @xcite .",
    "in summary , we prepared single crystals of metallic layered transition - metal oxide naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , and measured the thermoelectric power , the hall coefficient , and the magnetoresistance .",
    "all the measured quantities are unconventional : ( i ) the thermoelectric power is unusually large ( 100 @xmath13v / k at 300 k ) , ( ii ) the hall coefficient strongly depends on temperature , and ( iii ) the magnetoresistance is negative at 4.2 k. these results indicate that the conduction mechanism in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is not explained by a conventional band - picture and electron - phonon scattering .",
