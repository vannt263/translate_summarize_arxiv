    "neutralino dark matter within the mssm has long been among the most compelling candidates for particle dark matter . in many regions of the mssm parameter space , and in well - motivated , uv - complete subsets of the mssm , the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and therefore assumed to be stable due to conservation of r - parity . the abundance of the neutralino lsp , assuming that it s a thermal relic , is typically within a few orders of magnitude of the measured abundance of dark matter , @xmath0  @xcite , and in many cases obtains an abundance in perfect agreement with the measured value .",
    "this promising scenario has led to much optimism regarding the discovery prospects for supersymmetry and supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "however , no new supersymmetric particles have yet been discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , as no dark matter particles have yet been discovered via direct or indirect dark matter searches .",
    "null searches for supersymmetry and the discovery of the higgs boson with a mass of @xmath1 gev @xcite seem to be pointing to the possibility that supersymmetric particles , if the universe is indeed supersymmetric , are , in general , at the tev scale or beyond .",
    "however , the current data clearly leave open the possibility of electroweak - scale sleptons  @xcite . if thta is the case , as will be shown here , it is possible to satisfy all collider constraints and obtain a higgs boson with a mass of @xmath1 gev in models where the neutralino lsp is bino - like and a true weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter candidate  @xcite . here",
    "we explore this scenario , the possibility that consistency with collider data and consistency with the dark matter abundance can be obtained by considering two separate sectors of the mssm parameter space , as well as the related prospects for direct dark matter detection in these types of models  @xcite .",
    "while there are a plethora of observable quantities predicted within a supersymmetric model that , if different from the standard model ( sm ) expectation , would be evidence of supersymmetry or particle dark matter , there are currently no convincing observations of any deviations from the sm .",
    "if we are driven by the desire for electroweak - scale wimp dark matter in an mssm scenario consistent with collider constraints , we recognize that a very simple scenario survives : singlet fermion dark matter coupled to sm fermions via charged scalars . though this scenario , often termed the `` bulk '' region of parameter space ,",
    "has long been excluded in supersymmetric extensions of the sm such as the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , in fact there is no conflict with collider data to date in the more general mssm .",
    "here we re - open this region of parameter space for consideration , allowing a weak - scale bino dark matter candidate and sleptons with masses",
    "@xmath2 gev  @xcite as allowed by current constraints  @xcite .    there are , however , well - known obstacles to obtaining an appropriate dark matter abundance with a bino - like lsp annihilating via light slepton exchange : namely , the fact that the @xmath3-wave part of the annihilation cross section is typically chirality - suppressed by a factor @xmath4 , while the @xmath5-wave part of the cross section is velocity - suppressed by a factor @xmath6 at freeze - out . together ,",
    "these suppressions imply a dark matter annihilation cross section much smaller than that required for the abundance to be consistent with measurements . allowing for significant left - right mixing in the slepton sector",
    ", however , eliminates the chirality suppression , restoring the viability of bulk - type models for explaining the observed abundance of dark matter .",
    "in fact , one can completely specify the physics relevant to the relic density of dark matter by specifying the bino mass and slepton masses and mixings .",
    "we note that we consider only annihilation via slepton exchange to sm leptons . in principle",
    ", one could also consider neutralino - slepton coannihilation , which requires near degeneracy of the neutralino lsp with one of the sleptons , a much more `` tuned '' situation than that explored here . in order to predict a light @xmath7-even higgs boson consistent with observations",
    ", there must also be a heavy sector of parameter space , which includes , at a minimum , the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath8 , some heavy squark masses , and the top trilinear couplings . in practice the wino and gluino",
    "may also be decoupled , as well as some of the sleptons .",
    "introducing left - right mixing in the slepton sector is not without consequence .",
    "contributions to the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the sm leptons arise as one - loop vertex corrections , with the bino and sleptons running in the loop . since dipole moment operators flip the lepton helicity",
    ", these contributions can be large if left - right slepton mixing is large . within the sm ,",
    "the leading order contributions to the electric dipole moments of the charged leptons occur only at more than three loops  @xcite and are many orders of magnitude below the current constraints . as the dipole moment contributions are dependent not only on the slepton mixing angle , but also on the @xmath7-violating phase ( the electric dipole moment vanishes in the absence of @xmath7-violation )",
    ", we allow a @xmath7-violating phase for the sleptons , as well .",
    "the relic density sector now also completely specifies the physics relevant for corrections to the lepton dipole moments , and includes the bino mass , @xmath9 , and the slepton masses , @xmath10 , mixing angles , @xmath11 , and @xmath7-violating phases , @xmath12 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider each generation of sleptons separately , but we note that while the contributions to the dipole moments are independent , the contributions to the annihilation cross section are additive .",
    "because bino annihilation exhibits no @xmath3-channel resonances , one can expand @xmath13 in powers of @xmath14  @xcite as @xmath15 where the second term on the right hand side is suppressed by the velocity squared , while @xmath16 is the velocity - independent @xmath3-wave contribution , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the hypercharge coupling and @xmath19 are the slepton hypercharges . for simplicity",
    ", we have taken the limit of massless fermions , though the exact expressions for the annihilation cross section and the corrections to the dipole moments are used in the following analysis .",
    "we see that the @xmath3-wave contribution to the annihilation cross section is maximized for maximal left - right mixing , and vanishes in the absence of mixing or when the sleptons are degenerate .    again in the massless limit , the contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath20 , and the electric dipole moment , @xmath21 , of the associated lepton due to new physics are  @xcite @xmath22   -(\\tilde \\ell_1",

    "the corrections to the dipole moments also vanish in the absence of left - right mixing or when the sleptons are degenerate . comparing equation  [ eq : mdm ] and equation  [ eq : edm ]",

    "for this benchmark point , the abundance of dark matter can be obtained and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be explained for nearly maximal left - right smuon mixing and @xmath7-violating phase of @xmath40 for @xmath41 odd .",

    "furthermore , if the neutralino lsp is significantly heavier than 100 gev such that slepton exchange is not adequate to achieve the measured abundance of dark matter , it is still possible that the abundance is achieved through neutralino - squark coannihilations . in this section",

    "we note that this `` minimal '' value of @xmath80 is in fact larger than the value favored by lattice calculations and the default value used by micromegas versions 3.0 through 3.5.5  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the scattering cross section due to the uncertain quark content of the nucleon extends over two orders of magnitude .",
    "we also plot the current upper limit on the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section from lux  @xcite as a solid black contour , the projected sensitivity of lux with 300 days of data as a red dashed contour , and the projected sensitivity of the lz-7 experiment  @xcite as a blue dot - dashed contour .",
    "one can see that conclusions regarding the detectability of a particular model are strongly dependent on the strange quark content of the nucleon .    in figure",

    "<S> within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , we explore a decoupling of the parameters into separate sectors that determine consistency with collider data , the abundance of dark matter , and potential signatures at direct dark matter searches . </S>",
    "<S> we consider weak - scale bino - like neutralino dark matter , and find that annihilations via light slepton exchange present a viable mechanism for obtaining the appropriate dark matter abundance assuming a thermal history . </S>",
    "<S> constraints and prospects for discovery of these models are discussed , including the possibility that direct dark matter searches may be sensitive to these models if light squarks exhibit left - right mixing . </S>",
    "<S> differences between the scenarios presented here and the typical expectations for the mssm are discussed . </S>"
