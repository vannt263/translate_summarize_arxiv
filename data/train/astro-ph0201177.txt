    "the abundance ratio of atomic deuterium to hydrogen ( d / h ) is a key diagnostic of light element production and the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath4 in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn , walker et al .",
    "significant efforts in recent years to measure d / h in high redshift intergalactic gas have generally yielded values in the range d / h @xmath5 ( omeara et al . 2001 and references therein ) .    in galaxies , d / h is an important indicator of chemical evolution ( audouze & tinsley 1974 ; boesgard & steigman 1985 ; tosi et al .",
    "1998 ) , as d is easily destroyed in stars ( @xmath6 ) at temperatures of only a few million degrees .",
    "in fact , there are no known appreciable sources of d other than bbn .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) , as the repository of stellar mass loss , holds the keys to unravelling the chemical history of d over the age of the galaxy .",
    "measurements of atomic d / h in the ism were first made by the  satellite toward bright ob stars within @xmath7 pc of the sun ( rogerson & york 1973 ; see vidal - madjar & gry 1984 for a review ) .",
    "significant progress had been made using the hubble space telescope ( ) to obtain some precise d / h measurements in the local ism ( linsky et al .",
    "1998 ; vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1998 ) , but these have necessarily been limited to very low column density lines of sight ( @xmath8 ) where  can be used to measure the  column density .",
    "the d / h ratio was measured at high spectral resolution ( @xmath9 ) with the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps , jenkins et al .",
    "1988 , 1999 ) toward three ob stars ( , jenkins et al . 1999 ;  and , sonneborn et al .",
    "2000 ) first studied by .",
    "these studies showed unequivocally that there is a large spread in d / h ( factor of 3 ) on sight lines toward early type stars at distances of 300 - 500 pc .",
    "the imaps instrument was limited to observing very bright ob stars by its instrument design . at that time",
    "imaps could only observe the lower lyman series through  937 because its gratings were coated with lithium - fluoride ( lif ) .",
    "provides a new capability to study the entire lyman series ( except ) in much fainter stars than were possible with  or imaps , and hence d / h in the ism within 200 pc can now be studied systematically for the first time .",
    "this is important because the lines of sight to nearby stars are usually simpler with less blending of different velocity components .",
    "has sufficient sensitivity to perform absorption line studies of white dwarfs as well as extragalactic objects .",
    "both categories of targets were inaccessible to  or imaps .",
    "the study of d / h throughout the galaxy is one of the primary objectives of the  mission ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we report the analysis of d , n , and o abundances toward the o subdwarf 28  using high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio spectra obtained with . 28  has a very high temperature ( @xmath1082,000 k ) , lies at a distance of @xmath11 pc , and has a  column density , , of @xmath12 .",
    "this column density is much higher than those of the other lism lines of sight studied previously for d / h , and very similar to that of the d / h sight lines studied by imaps . in this  regime",
    "the lyman series shortward of  949 is required to study .",
    "because a measurement of d / h requires both accurate  and , we use  spectra to measure total column densities for , , and and /stis spectra of  to measure . even in the regime @xmath13 ,",
    "the damping wings of  and higher lyman series transitions are too weak to obtain an accurate  measurement .",
    "the observations and data processing are presented in  2 and the stellar atmosphere model and synthetic spectrum in  3 .",

    "one mdrs aperture ( 4@xmath1420 ) observation was made on 2000 july 17 for 24795 s ( obsid = m1040102 ) .",
    "the first observation was a short exposure to establish the feasibility and safety of using 28  for the  calibration program because its far - uv flux is very close to the bright limit of the  detectors ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the subsequent observations were made for the purpose of testing the acquisition of data with the focal plane assembly ( fpa ) offset to different positions along the dispersion direction as a technique to reduce fixed - pattern noise when the observations are later coaligned and added .",
    "this procedure and the results are discussed below . the  instrument and its performance are described by moos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sahnow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the data were obtained in `` histogram '' mode because of the high far - uv flux of the star . in this data acquisition mode a two - dimensional spectral image is accumulated on board , eliminating any timing information within individual exposures .",
    "the observations were split into four intervals of approximately equal exposure time , each with a different x - offset of the fpa . the exposure time required for the last two lwrs fpa positions",
    "was obtained in part during observation m1040101 and in part during observation m1040105 . a shift in fpa",
    "x causes a corresponding shift in the location of the spectrum on the detector along the dispersion direction .",
    "the spectral shifts and exposure times are given in table [ fpsplit ] .",
    "the fpa is fixed for the duration of each exposure so that there is no loss in spectral resolution relative to an observation taken at a single fpa location .",
    "the offsets for the mdrs observations span a smaller range in fes x than those of the lwrs observations in order to provide sufficient margin in the fpa range of motion .",
    "this margin is needed so that mdrs peakups can properly adjust the fpa s to correct for image motion caused by small rotations of the primary mirrors on orbital timescales . for further information on this image motion",
    "see sahnow et al .",
    "the shifts caused by this image motion , together with shifts caused by similar rotations of the gratings , result in a distribution of shifts clustered about the mean offsets given in table [ fpsplit ] .",
    "even for mdrs , these spectral offsets span a range roughly twice the width of typical interstellar absorption lines or of the high - frequency components of the detector fixed pattern noise .",
    "exposure durations varied from 430 s to 535 s in order to minimize doppler smearing of the spectrum by satellite orbital motion so that there is no degradation of spectral resolution .",
    "most of the lwrs exposures were obtained during orbital night when  and  airglow emission is absent and that of  is significantly reduced . when exposures having both orbital night and day segments are considered , over 70% of the lwrs data was obtained during orbital night . over 82% of the mdrs data was obtained at night .",
    "the data were processed with the latest version of the fuse calibration pipeline ( calfuse v. 1.8.7 ) . for each channel ,",
    "data for each exposure were aligned by cross correlation and combined on a common heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "part of the resulting spectrum for the lwrs observations is shown in figure [ bdspec ] .",
    "the lwrs lif co - added spectra have s / n@xmath16 per 0.05   resolution element in the lif channels and s / n@xmath17 in the short - wavelength silicon - carbide ( sic ) channels .",
    "the s / n in the mdrs spectra of 28  are about 25% lower than for lwrs .",
    "these s / n levels are close to the photon - noise limits .",
    "the analyses presented in this paper uses primarily sic channel spectra",
    ". figure [ lyspec ] shows small sections of the spectrum near several of the lyman lines and demonstrates the high quality of our spectra .",
    "our analysis of spectral features in the 28  co - added spectra indicates that the spectral resolution is consistent with @xmath18 20,000 , the nominal spectral resolution obtained by the  instrument ( sahnow et al .",
    "it is evident from figures [ bdspec ] and [ lyspec ] that airglow has a negligible effect on these spectra .",
    "is the strongest airglow transition in the  band pass and the observed  profile is only weakly affected .",
    "airglow , if present , would primarily effect the stronger transitions longward of @xmath19  , but the  column density is determined from much weaker lines that are unaffected .",
    "figures [ bdspec]-[model923 ] show that the saturated  lines have non - zero residual flux ( on the order of a few percent ) .",
    "the  instrument has very low levels of scattered light ( moos et al .",
    "2000 , sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) , as shown by the zero flux level below the lyman limit ( see fig . [ bdspec ] ) .",
    "the residual flux in the lyman lines is probably the result of wings of the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ; see kruk et al .",
    "the shape of the lsf and its potential effects on the line profile analysis is discussed further in  [ dnointro ] .",
    "macrae , fleischer , & weston ( 1951 ) reported the first spectral analysis of 28  and classified it as an extremely blue star with peculiar spectrum ( op ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of 28  attracted their attention because of its very blue continuum and the presence of balmer and lines .",
    "greenstein ( 1952 ) estimated the distance to 28  and found out that the star was a subdwarf .",
    "28is now classified as sdo , based on the study of moehler et al.(1990 ) , in which the class is defined as having  and strong balmer absorption lines . although low resolution optical spectra show only these lines , high - resolution spectra reveal , in addition , many weak metal lines .",
    "herbig ( 1999 ) obtained high - resolution optical spectra of 28  at the keck  i telescope and detected a significant number of narrow absorption and emission lines ( , , , , , and ) , and also emission cores in h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , and @xmath236560 , 5411 , 4685 lines . using the absorption lines , herbig ( 1999 ) set an upper limit on the star s rotational velocity , @xmath24 .",
    "even though 28  is a well - known spectrophotometric standard star in the ultraviolet and optical ( see , e.g. , bohlin 1986 ; massey et al .",
    "1988 ) , its atmospheric parameters were investigated only recently by napiwotzki ( 1993 ) , werner ( 1996 ) , and haas et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "using h+he nlte stellar model atmospheres , napiwotzki ( 1993 ) tried to fit the balmer line profiles in 28 s optical spectrum with no success .",
    "he demonstrated that the effective temperatures obtained from fits of individual balmer lines showed large discrepancies .",
    "this inconsistency , known as the balmer line problem , was also observed in central stars of old planetary nebulae and dao white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , napiwotzki & schnberner 1993 ; napiwozki & raunch 1994 ; bergeron et al .",
    "1994 ) . to overcome this problem , napiwotzki ( 1993 )",
    "modeled the @xmath255876 line , as it is a very sensitive diagnostic of effective temperature ( ) , and obtained @xmath26,000  k and @xmath27 .",
    "he also derived the gravity @xmath28 from the higher balmer lines .    by analyzing the optical spectra of 28 and",
    "the central star of the planetary nebula s216 , werner ( 1996 ) concluded that the balmer line problem was caused by the omission or inadequate inclusion of metal opacities .",
    "for instance , he matched the balmer lines ( h@xmath21-h@xmath29 ) of 28 combining napiwotzki s ( 1993 ) parameters ( @xmath30,000  k , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) and the improved stark - broadened cno line profiles .",
    "he demonstrated that the effect of this added opacities increased the temperature in the deeper layers of the atmosphere , and decreased the temperature in the superficial layers , therefore modifying the balmer line formation .",
    "he noted that the low balmer series members cores are deeper as they are formed higher in the atmosphere , where the temperature is lower . on the other hand ,",
    "the high balmer series members were less affected because they originate from deeper layers of the atmosphere .",
    "this new temperature structure caused by the addition of more realistic metal line opacities resolved the balmer line discrepancy .",
    "interestingly , bergeron et al . (",
    "1993 ) had reached a similar conclusion to that of werner ( 1996 ) by analyzing the dao white dwarf feige  55 and using a lte iron - blanketed model .    for the purpose of this study",
    ", we adopt the stellar atmospheric parameters determined by napiwotzki ( 1993 ) as they are the best available .",
    "we compute a grid of h+he nlte model atmospheres with the following atmospheric parameters : @xmath33000  k , 82000  k , and 86000  k ; @xmath34 , 6.2 , and 6.4 ; and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we also compute a metal - line blanketed model including the following chemical composition : h , he , c , n , o , si , s , fe , and ni . we then compute a grid of synthetic spectra from  to the lyman limit using the tlusty program developed by hubeny & lanz ( 1995 ) and an upgraded version of the program synspec ( i.  hubeny 2000 , private communication ) , which incorporates the lemke ( 1997 ) stark broadening tables for hydrogen .",
    "we explored the model parameter space ( , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) to evaluate the uncertainties in the stellar  lyman +  balmer line profiles .",
    " 4 describes in more details the use of stellar models to dermine the  column density .    the  spectrum of 28  ( fig .",
    "[ bdspec ] ) shows many stellar and interstellar lines .",
    "the stellar spectrum displays the lyman series of hydrogen from  up to ly-9 and the  balmer series from 1084   up to at least 942  .",
    "the spectrum also contains many stellar lines of highly ionized species , such as , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .",
    "the strongest lines are the @xmath25923.15 sextuplet , @xmath23933.38 , 944.52 doublet , @xmath25955.33 , and @xmath23 1031.91 , 1037.61 doublet . in order to identify potential blending of photospheric and ism lines , we first performed an abundance analysis of 28 s atmosphere and then calculated a synthetic spectrum using the derived abundances .",
    "figure [ model923 ] illustrates the comparison between the synthetic spectrum and the fuse spectrum for the wavelength range 920927  .",
    "28  has several strong , narrow metal lines in the  range and that made it possible to register the wavelength scale of the stellar model with the observed spectrum . in particular , 944.523 is seen in both sic channels and has a deep , narrow core .",
    "we used this line to align the model with the spectra . as expected , the zero point wavelengths are different from channel to channel because it depends on the fpa position as well as the location of the star in the aperture .",
    "it varied between @xmath40 and @xmath41 in our data , although larger offsets were occasionally detected in the first year of  operations ( sahnow et al .",
    "once the wavelength offsets are corrected , the best estimate from the  data of the velocity of the star relative to the ism is @xmath42 , a value that is consistent with our more accurate determination of @xmath43 from  spectra ( see below ) .",
    "we increased the error to @xmath44 to take into account any remaining uncertainties in the  wavelength calibration .",
    "the determination of the interstellar  column density along the sight line to 28  uses an extensive series of archival observations taken with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the .",
    "the  column density may in principle be determined using the  observations of this star .",
    "however , most of the lyman - series lines in the  bandpass are on the flat part of the curve of growth . in addition , the damping wings of interstellar  and , the strongest  transitions in the  bandpass are significantly less prominent than those for  and comparable in strength with the stellar  +  profiles .",
    "therefore , the only reliable procedure for determining an accurate  column density to 28  is by fitting the lorentzian wings of the very strong  line .",
    "as illustrated below , the interstellar  profile is much stronger that its stellar counterpart .",
    "28  is a calibration source for stis , and observations have been acquired over several years with the e140 m echelle grating projecting the two - dimensional spectrum onto the fuv mama ( kimble et al .",
    "1998 ; woodgate et al . 1998 ) .",
    "all data were taken through the @xmath45 aperture and cover the spectral range @xmath46  .",
    "this instrumental setup provides a spectral resolution @xmath47 ( @xmath48 fwhm ) , although the line spread function for data taken through this aperture has significant power in broad wings that extend well beyond this width ( see figure 13.87 in the cycle 9 stis instrument handbook ) .",
    "we used eight such observations taken over the time period 1997 sept .",
    "19 to 2000 nov",
    "exposure times for the individual observations were in the range 3501800 s. figure [ lyalpha ] shows a coaddition of the data sets used in our analysis in the region near .",
    "this figure demonstrates the quality of the data and shows the importance of high spectral resolution for separating the numerous stellar and interstellar lines in this region .",
    "the e140 m data have been reduced using the calstis pipeline by two different approaches in an attempt to uncover sources of systematic error .",
    "one used the pipeline as developed by the stis instrument definition team , the other the standard stsdas pipeline distributed within iraf ( see voit 1997 ) .",
    "the calstis pipeline removes an estimated dark level , applies a flat field , corrects small - scale distortions , identifies the spectral trace , removes scattered light , extracts the one - dimensional spectrum , and performs the wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "we show below that both analysis approaches yield the same result .",
    "the scattered - light removal process is among the most important , particularly for our purposes where we are interested in the large - scale wings of the  profile . because the strength of the echelle - scattered light can be significant in e140 m spectra , the bowers & lindler algorithm ( see landsman & bowers 1997 ; bowers et al .",
    "1998 ) was used to estimate and remove scattered light from the data in the pipeline procedures .",
    "we found that this algorithm does a good job of determining an appropriate zero - level , as evidenced by the small residual fluxes in the saturated cores of strong lines ( e.g. , the  profile shown in fig .",
    "[ lyalpha ] ) .    after extracting the spectrum , several echelle spectral orders in the regions adjacent to",
    "were combined using a weighted averaging scheme where the orders overlap .",
    "the flux calibration between orders seems good for the e140 m data sets used here .",
    "even so , there can be some small fluctuations in the final co - added spectrum due to mismatches at the edges of orders , although in general these can be masked out and do not significantly affect our analysis .",
    "the method for deriving the  column density along this sight line follows jenkins ( 1971 ) and subsequent work ( see discussion , particularly of error analysis , in vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1998 ; howk , savage , & fabian 1999 ; jenkins et al . 1999 ; sonneborn et al .",
    "the distribution of optical depth , @xmath49 , with wavelength for  is given by the product of the absorption cross - section , @xmath50 , and the column density .",
    "for  at  this is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the  line center at the velocity centroid of interstellar hydrogen .",
    "the  column density is determined to be the one that best matches the above distribution of optical depth with the observed profile .",
    "this method only gives information on the total column of , since the details of the component structure are all within the strongly - saturated core of the  line which spans a velocity range of @xmath53 .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that the damping wings are affected by low column density  absorption features .",
    "any  absorber that could modify the shape of the damping wings would have to have a heliocentric velocity @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "9 of sonneborn et al .",
    "the broad damping wings of  are not sensitive to the doppler broadening parameter .",
    "we therefore have very little information about @xmath55 from the  analysis .",
    "the derivation of  was performed with two independent , though similar , fitting procedures .",
    "both vary the important free parameters , which for our purposes include @xmath52 and , to minimize the @xmath56 statistic between the model , after convolution with the instrumental lsf , and the observed spectra ( see , e.g. , jenkins et al .",
    "we note that the specifics of the lsf are relatively unimportant for  as large as is found on this sight line ( see , e.g. , appendix a of howk et al .",
    "this insensitivity includes the possible presence of the broad wings of the stis e140 m lsf mentioned above , which are on a much smaller scale than that of the  absorption .",
    "we applied masks to exclude obvious stellar and interstellar absorption features from the fit .",
    "we also avoided fitting the very deepest portion of the  line core ( effectively those regions with flux @xmath57 of the stellar continuum within @xmath58   of the line center ) because of the possibility that stellar lines may be unseen in this low signal - to - noise region of the spectrum .",
    "the stellar atmosphere for this type of star also has broad  +  absorption .",
    "it is , therefore , important to account for the stellar continuum underlying the interstellar absorption in our fitting process . for this purpose",
    "we used the synthetic spectrum and stellar  +  line profile described in  [ bd - model ] .",
    "the computed stellar spectrum was shifted to a heliocentric velocity of @xmath59 , the radial velocity of 28 , for comparison with the observed  profile .",
    "we determined this radial velocity by measuring the velocities of prominent stellar lines in the stis e140 m observations , the average of which gives a heliocentric velocity of @xmath60 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is the @xmath61 standard deviation of the individual measurements about the mean and does not include the uncertainties in the stis absolute wavelength scale , which probably correspond to @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "this determination agrees well with the stellar radial velocity of @xmath64 derived by herbig ( 1999 ) , where we use the mean and @xmath61 standard deviation of his individual measurements . for comparison , the average velocity of interstellar material along this sight line is @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( stronger lines give more negative velocity components due to the presence of weaker components on the blue side of the interstellar profiles ) .",
    "the stellar radial velocity is well constrained , although we found that offsets from this best value as large as @xmath67 have no effect on the derived  column density .",
    "the model stellar spectrum was scaled to best match the observed flux distribution using a second - order legendre polynomial , the parameters of which are treated as free parameters in the fitting process . in general , the shape of the calculated stellar model far from line center fits the data relatively well .",
    "however , the adoption of a low - order polynomial correction to the synthetic stellar continuum allows for several possible systematic effects , including mis - matches between the observed spectrum and the model , slight redistribution of flux in the scattered light removal process , stellar atmospheric variability , and other properties of the detector and observations that could change the absolute flux distribution on angstrom scales .",
    "we also allowed for the effects of uncertainty in the flux zero point , treating it as a free parameter in the fit .",
    "this corrects for any small uncertainty in the background subtraction on scales of several angstroms .",
    "the derived corrections to the flux zero point were always less than a percent or two of the continuum away from the line core .    because of the possibility that the stellar  profile could be variable , we fit separately each of the individual observations taken at different times .",
    "no evidence of variability was found .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below in our discussion of systematic uncertainties .",
    "figure [ lyalpha ] shows the best fit interstellar  profile on top of the coadded stis observations .",
    "the final estimate for the  column is @xmath68 , where the uncertainties are @xmath69 confidence limits ( @xmath70 if gaussian errors are appropriate ) including systematic effects .",
    "this is an average of the results from the two  determinations , which differed by only 0.003 dex ( @xmath71 ) , and uncertainties , for which we adopted the larger of the uncertainty estimates .",
    "the uncertainties in  given above include estimates of the statistical ( random ) and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature . because of the high quality of the data and the strength of the   damping wings , the systematics dominate the statistical uncertainties in our analysis . given the importance of the systematic uncertainties , we discuss several below and their impact on the @xmath72 determination .",

    "this sets an upper bound on the magnitude of the uncertainties due to the stellar models .",
    "the effects of imperfectly - known stellar atmospheric parameters on  were estimated by refitting the interstellar absorption profile using model atmospheres with the most extreme stellar properties that are still nominally consistent with the determination of the atmospheric parameters ( see  [ bd - model ] ) .",

    "the  spectra were also analyzed to develop a model for interstellar 2  for rotational levels @xmath81 .",
    "the comparison of measurements from multiple channels ( sic1 and sic2 ) and observations ( lwrs and mdrs ) is a powerful tool that improves our statistics and helps to identify poor data quality due to instrumental effects .    in the cog method",
    "the equivalent width , , of several lines of the same species having different oscillator strengths are measured and their distribution in the @xmath82 plane is compared with a theoretical curve of growth for a single absorption component subject to a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the free parameters in the fit are the column density , @xmath83 and doppler spread parameter , @xmath55 . however , if there is a complex velocity distribution , @xmath55 is regarded as an `` effective '' doppler spread and as such has no physical meaning .",
    "continuum placement and equivalent width measurements are treated in independent steps and assume some a posteriori conservative error bars to take into account the uncertainties in continuum placement .",
    "the cog method is potentially vulnerable to error because of the assumption of a single - component profile . in particular , at the  spectral resolution narrow , unresolved components could be concealed by broader features , which could result in underestimated column densities ( nachman & hobbs 1973 , savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "jenkins ( 1986 ) showed that column densities accurate to @xmath1010% can be obtained with the cog method provided that the lines are not heavily saturated @xmath84 and have smooth distributions of @xmath55 and @xmath85 in their components . in the case where all transitions are on the linear part of the cog ,",
    "the column density is insensitive to the line - of - sight velocity structure .",
    "one of the advantages of the cog method is that it is not too sensitive to the lsf . on the other hand , transitions blended with lines from other species",
    "should be avoided in this analysis technique . in this case",
    ", profile fitting may be more appropriate .",
    "the profile fitting method makes the same basic assumptions as the cog : an interstellar absorption line is formed in a single component and is described by two parameters : @xmath83 and @xmath55 .",
    "in addition the wavelength centroid of the line , or radial velocity , @xmath86 , is also a free parameter .",
    "the fitting technique also assumes that each interstellar component produces absorption lines described by voigt profiles .",
    "we note that in our analysis the doppler parameter , @xmath55 , has no unique physical interpretation .",
    "normally @xmath87 .",
    "however , from the  spectra alone , with spectral resolution of @xmath88 , temperature ( @xmath89 ) and turbulent motion ( @xmath90 ) effects on the line widths are not easily separated .",
    "we can , however , use @xmath55 to set an upper limit on @xmath89 .    lines of sight with multiple components are often more reliably analyzed with a fitting technique than it is with the cog . in practice , to fit a multiple - component cog requires a prior knowledge of @xmath86 and @xmath55 for each component as well as their expected relative ratios .",
    "this information is not necessary with profile fitting because in principle it lies in the profiles .",
    "for the same reason , the blending of adjacent lines is also easier to model with a fitting procedure .",
    "a second significant advantage of our profile fitting analysis is that absorption lines and continua are fit simultaneously so that continuum shape and placement are treated as free parameters .",
    "we have used the profile fitting program owens.f ( lemoine et al . 2001 , hbrard et al . 2001 ) .",
    "owens.f is a powerful profile fitting program that simultaneously models multiple spectral lines , species , and absorption components in an arbitrary number of spectral regions , or windows .",
    "many quantities characterizing the fit may be treated as free or fixed parameters ( @xmath91 , lsf , continuum placement and shape , background level , velocity offset between spectral windows , etc . ) .",
    "the program uses an optimized -minimization algorithm to obtain fast convergence .",
    "the flexibility of owens.f allowed us to analyze many different cases .",
    "as with any convergence algorithm , parameter space was explored to verify that a converged solution was the true minimum and not a local minimum far from the true solution .",
    "this was done by changing the initial parameters and/or conditions and then running the program again to reach a new converged solution . a potential disadvantage of profile",
    "fitting is that knowledge of the instrument lsf is required , and errors in the assumed lsf have the potential to bias the results .",
    "the instrumental lsf is a key parameter in the profile fitting analysis of interstellar absorption lines .",
    "the characterization of the  lsf was incomplete at the time of this analysis ( see kruk et al .",
    "although there is evidence that the  lsf has wings that effect the zero level of heavily saturated lines (  [ obs ] ) , two independent analyses ( hbrard et al .",
    "2001 , wood et al .",
    "2001 ) show that modelling of weak unsaturated lines with a single gaussian lsf and a double gaussian lsf give very consistent results within the uncertainties of the  lsf parameters ( see the companion papers referenced above for further details ) . for our profile",
    "fitting analyses we used a single gaussian lsf for each component modelled .",

    "the following subsections describe the cog analysis of  and  and the profile fitting analysis of , , and .",
    "the  spectra of 28  contain a large number of absorption lines from interstellar molecular hydrogen .",
    "absorption arising from 2  rotational levels @xmath81 can be clearly seen along this line of sight .",
    "many 2  lines are blended with stellar and other ism features . for transitions corresponding to the rotational level @xmath92",
    "there are not enough unblended lines to derive a reliable column density using either cog or profile fitting techniques .",
    "however , a @xmath93 upper limit for 2  @xmath92 is derived . a few 2  transitions from @xmath94 and 6",
    "may also be present .",
    "the best candidate is werner @xmath95 q(5 ) at 1017.831  .",
    "however , the  spectra of 28  contain many unidentified stellar features and it is possible that this and other weak transitions could be stellar in origin , or if actual 2  ism lines , blended with stellar lines .",
    "due to these uncertainties , the column densities for @xmath96 could not be estimated .",
    "the 2  column densities for rotational levels @xmath97 were measured using both profile fitting and cog methods , using lines that appeared free of blending , as judged by the shape of the absorption profile and with the help of the stellar model .",
    "profile fitting used only unsaturated lines , i.e. lines for which the absorption profile deconvolved with the lsf did not have a residual intensity in the line core @xmath98 . the column density for each rotational level",
    "was determined independently .",
    "the synthetic stellar spectrum gave guidance when selecting the 2  lines to be analyzed in order to avoid blending with stellar features .",
    "each spectral region ( several angstroms ) was first normalized with a spline function .",
    "a subset of this region , a spectral window of @xmath99 , was used by owens.f where a polynomial ( up to @xmath100 order ) was fit to the continuum away from the line .",
    "we restricted the size of the spectral windows used in the owens.f analysis because of concern about small nonlinearities in the  wavelength calibration on larger scales .",
    "the number of lines analyzed for each @xmath101 level are listed in table [ nh2table ] .",
    "all the 2  lines analyzed lie away from the  lines .",
    "the background was set to zero for each window .",
    "the width of the gaussian lsf was free to vary from window to window and between successive fits .",
    "once the best fit was found , corresponding to a minimum , the error in the column density was calculated by fixing 2  to a different value and computing a new optimized fit , which always had a larger .",
    "the difference of the new reduced  from  determined the 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and @xmath102 deviations from the best fit .",
    "the adopted @xmath61 error was the average of these values to allow for any asymmetry in the @xmath103  curve .",
    "only an upper limit was derived for 2  @xmath92 , the result of its weak transitions being indistinguishable from weak stellar features . 2  and",
    "@xmath70 errors derived this way are given in table  [ nh2table ] .",
    "the 2  equivalent widths were measured by directly integrating the area of several lines for each rotational level for @xmath97 .",
    "the continuum near each line was defined by a legendre polynomial up to @xmath104 order .  of each transition is the weighted average of  measured in each channel where the line was present .",
    "a single - component gaussian cog was fit to the data for each rotational level , and the residuals about the best - fit curve were minimized ( figure [ h2cog ] ) .",
    "the resulting column densities are completely consistent with the profile fitting results , although with somewhat larger uncertainties . assuming the population of the lower rotational states of 2  is determined by collisional excitation and a boltzmann distribution , the excitation temperatures are @xmath105 k , @xmath106 k and @xmath107 k. however",
    ", the similarity of @xmath108 for @xmath97 indicates that one or more of these assumptions may not be correct .",
    "the uncertainty in 2  @xmath109 may permit a more typical value of @xmath110 k. the total 2  column density is log(2)@xmath111 .",
    "the high s / n of the  observations of 28  permits analysis of the  transitions down to 916   where the  profiles start to overlap .",
    "however , some of the higher  lyman series lines ( 916918  ) have strengths that vary significantly from line to line and channel to channel .",
    "these inconsistencies probably originate in the fixed pattern noise of the detector and/or in blends with weak stellar features or interstellar 2 .",
    "therefore , the cog analysis of  was limited to the six transitions listed in table [ doeqw ] .",
    "most of the  lines (   ) lie in the blue wing of the corresponding  lines .",
    "four out of the six transitions fall on the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "hence , the velocity structure on the line of sight does not influence the final column density estimate ( see  [ diprof ] ) .",
    "the stellar  and  and interstellar  absorption profiles dominate the shape of the continuum near the  feature .",
    "a continuum model was constructed , where the key parameters are , 2 , and @xmath55 for the ism model computed with owens.f and , @xmath38 and he / h for the stellar model .",

    "the uncertainties in  and @xmath38 considered in the  analysis ( @xmath105% ) have a negligible effect on the shape of the  +   profile near the  lines we are studying . while varying these parameters would change the goodness of the fit far from the core of the  lines , the continuum placement would be similar . as to the he / h ratio ,",
    "this affects only the two strongest lines (  and ) where  is readily apparent in the model .",
    "the overall shape of the model agrees well with the spectrum , although we noted some localized discrepancies .",
    "the different spectra showed flux scale differences from the model of up to + 5% for lwrs and + 10% for mdrs .",
    "the latter suffered from small variations in slit transmission due to mirror motion ( see sahnow et al . 2000 ) and a small part of the flux was lost in this process .",
    "the mdrs flux calibration is also less well known than that of the lwrs channel .",
    "we modelled the interstellar  profiles by using owens.f to fit the relevant  lyman series transitions ( 919  972  ) , forcing the column density to log ( ) = 19.85 and the adopted the 2  parameters from table [ nh2table ] .",
    "a one - component fit agreed well with the data .",
    "a three - component fit was also performed ( cf .  [ diprof ] ) but there was no improvement in the fit because in  these components are buried in the saturated line cores .",
    "the purpose of this  model was to find a good empirical match with the data to assist in the measurements of  , not to determine .",
    "the general method for measuring  for the  lines is illustrated in figure [ cogmethod ] .",
    "first , the data were divided by the stellar model appropriately registered in  and @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ cogmethod]a and d ) .",
    "this process sometimes produced what was judged to be a poor fit in the red wing of interstellar , especially for 925 .",

    "is consistent with the other  transitions analyzed .",
    "second , the normalized spectrum was then corrected for interstellar  ( fig .",
    "[ cogmethod]b and e ) by using the  model profiles described above .  of each  feature",
    "was measured by fitting a gaussian to the residual  absorption line ( fig .",
    "[ cogmethod]c and f ) using all of the profile except the far red wing of where the near - zero flux near the line core of  produces large residuals .",
    "since the principal source of error in this analysis is the stellar continuum placement , we adopted a conservative approach , scaling the continua by @xmath1133% and remeasuring .",
    "this produced noticeably poor fits that represent extreme cases .",
    "we assumed that these fits were @xmath70 from the best fit .",
    "therefore , the errors include the systematic error due to continuum placement .",
    "table [ doeqw ] gives the  values for each channel and aperture .",
    "there are four independent measurements of w for each di transition ( sic1 and sic2 , lwrs and mdrs ) .",
    "these measurements were consistent to within @xmath61 , except for the three cases where  was omitted .",
    "these measurements were discarded because they were inconsistent ( discrepant by @xmath11450% ) with the other measurements of the same transition .",
    "we concluded that these cases were probably caused by detector artifacts ( fixed - pattern noise ) after careful comparison of line profiles in the four aperture and channel combinations .",
    "the far right hand column in table [ doeqw ] is the mean  used in the cog .",
    "the cog fit for   is shown in figure [ diallcog ] .",

    "the two strongest  transitions used for the cog (  and ) were omitted from the profile fits because they are mildly saturated ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "uncertainties in our knowledge of the  lsf could influence the results derived from profile fits to such lines . in any case ,  is well constrained by the other five transitions .",
    "although the continuum close to the  lines is very smooth and easily fit with a low - order polynomial , some of the  transitions used in the cog are indeed saturated and for this reason they were not included in the  profile fitting analysis using owens.f .",

    "the strongest of these has @xmath123 .",
    "there are many  transitions in the  range and four multiplets are detected : 952 , 953 , 964 , and 1134 . the 952   triplet is free of any blending with 2  or ism atomic lines and seems clear of stellar features .",
    "since all the lines of this triplet are still on the linear part of the curve of growth , deriving the column density is straightforward .",

    "the continuum for the  line profiles was determined by a different approach than was used for the  measurements .",
    "there is sufficient information immediately adjacent to the   features to establish the continuum with a polynomial without normalizing the spectrum or modelling the stellar and interstellar .",
    "the shoulder of the blue wing of the interstellar   profile , excluding the  feature , was fit by a @xmath100 order polynomial .",
    "examples of the continuum and  profile fits are shown in figure [ difits ] .",
    "the effective @xmath55 is not tightly constrained in this analysis because the true shapes of the  profiles are unresolved for these weak lines .",
    "the effect of simultaneously modelling the interstellar  and  profiles and fitting a polynomial to the stellar contribution alone was also examined .",

    "very high resolution spectra of species such as  are needed to determine the component structure , @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the neutral gas as a function of velocity .",
    "the o / h ratio toward 28  is @xmath151 , a value that is anomalously low with respect to the local buble and the ism .",
    "the 28  o / h is marginally consistent with the mean o / h ratio in the ism ( @xmath152o / h@xmath153 ) of @xmath154 found by meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in a study of  1355 on 13 sight lines toward ob stars at distances of 130  1500 pc .",
    "recently , however , meyer ( 2001 ) updated @xmath152o / h@xmath153 to @xmath155 as a result on a revised @xmath117-value for the 1355 transition .",
    "the  o / h ratio toward 28  is well outside the estimated uncertainties in the revised @xmath152o / h@xmath153 . in the local bubble @xmath152o / h@xmath156 ( moos et al .",

    "of the five sight lines for which o / h is measured by , only 28  gives a value that disagrees with @xmath152o / h@xmath153 and @xmath152o / h@xmath157 . if correct , the gas just outside the local bubble has a low o abundance .",
    "this implies that the gas toward 28  beyond the local bubble would appear to have a different chemical history than that sampled in the meyer et al .",
    "we have searched for other possible explainations for the low o / h ration toward 28 .",

    "2000 ) , so the -to-  ratio should accurately reflect the total o / h abundance ratio . if the error is in the  column density , then correcting o / h to obtain agreement with @xmath152o / h@xmath153 would result in a large d / h ratio ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "such a d / h value for 28  would be similar to that found for feige 110 ( friedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and  ( sonneborn et al . 2000 ) . however , a @xmath1040% increase in  would be inconsistent with the available spectra .",

    "[ oifits ] ) that the three  lines are unsaturated .",
    "line saturation , possibly as the result of narrow ( cold gas ) components would result in an underestimated column density .",
    "the effect of potential line saturation in  was examined by excluding the strongest  line ( 930 ) from the fitting analysis , leaving only the two weaker  lines . for this case",
    "we found log  = 16.28 , which is within @xmath70 of the best fit .",
    "we can not determine whether this difference in @xmath83 is the result of saturation , fixed pattern noise , lsf uncertainties , component structure , or some other cause .",
    "if this were the correct  column density , the o / h ratio would be @xmath160 , still well below @xmath152o / h@xmath153 and @xmath152o / h@xmath157 .",

    "if so , then the n / h ratio toward 28  could well be consistent with the mean ism result .    in the local ism",

    "there are only two  transitions in the  bandpass ( 915.6 and 1085.5 ) and both of them are heavily saturated on all but the lowest column density sight lines .",
    "we derived a lower limit of log  @xmath163 using both optical depth technique and profile fitting .",
    "since we know that some  is associated with the neutral component , we estimate an upper limit assuming that the @xmath55-value for   is greater than that of the neutral gas .",
    "these assumptions give an upper limit of log  @xmath164 .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that an apreciable fraction of the nitrogen on the sight line toward 28  could be singly ionized .",
    "objects like the hot subdwarf 28  are important targets for studying  and  in the ism with  because they can sample regions of space beyond that accessible with white dwarfs ( @xmath165 pc ) and closer that that sampled by the lightly - reddened o stars observable by  ( @xmath166 kpc ) .",
