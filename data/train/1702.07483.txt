    "in 1970 , gardner and ashby conducted a set of simulations experiments to study the stability of complex systems with entities that are connected at random @xcite . in a seminal work",
    ", robert may complemented their study by providing an analytical framework based on random matrix theory to describe the sharp transition from stability to instability as a function of the number of components ( species ) in the network @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on a notion of stability known as neighborhood stability in a deterministic model . in particular",
    ", the model assumes that for a state vector @xmath0 of size @xmath1 characterizing a small perturbation to the state ( e.g. , number of species ) of each component around the equilibrium point , we have @xmath2 in this model , @xmath3 is an identity matrix of size @xmath1 that corresponds to the intrinsic stability of components , and @xmath4 is the component - wise interaction matrix of size @xmath5 with elements being random numbers drawn from a probability distribution with a mean of 0 and finite variance .",
    "one is then interested in the community equilibria , where all net growth rates of species are zero .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis is limited in two ways :    \\i ) although the interaction matrix @xmath4 in equation([may ] ) is random , the analysis does not capture the effect of random environmental fluctuations . as may stated @xcite ,",
    " once the dice have been rolled to get a specific system , the subsequent analysis is purely deterministic \" .",
    "however , real systems are stochastic in nature , with underlying parameters exhibiting random fluctuations ( see ref.@xcite p. 17 ) .",
    "\\ii ) many complex systems seem to be the result of two types of constituents that have a counteracting influence on equilibrium of the system  for example , the the prey - predator ecological systems @xcite , the neutron - proton model of a nucleus , or the stabilizing and destabilizing speculators in a financial system @xcite .",
    "however , the states of all components of the model in equation([may ] ) undergo the same machinery , which is to say that on the left of this equation , we have the net growth rate , and on the right we have the product of the state vector by a matrix .",
    "therefore , it seems impossible that this model can capture the dynamics of such complex networks of interactions .",
    "may later extended this framework to a fully stochastic ecological environment . in ref.@xcite , he pictured an environment in which the interaction dynamics of species populations are not only random but are also subject to random environmental fluctuations . assuming the random environmental fluctuations are characterized by a  white noise \" , he formulated the dynamics of the problem as a multivariate flokker - planck equation .",
    "however , the complicated nature of these equations makes the exact solution of the multivariate setting hopeless .",
    "instead , the exact solution in a univariate case ( one species ) can be determined , and some gaussian approximations for the solutions of multivariate flokker - planck equations when the variance of white noise is very small are proposed .",
    "he concluded that the stability of the system ( ref.@xcite , p. 114 ) `` depends on the balance of power between the countervailing forces of stabilizing population interactions and randomizing environmental fluctuations '' .    in this work",
    ", we aim to establish a general theory that captures the dynamics of a complex stochastic system and quantifies the effect of two types of counteracting entities on the equilibrium point of the system .",
    "our theory must account for complex systems in general and , as such , we may not rely on physical laws governing a specific field of study .",
    "consequently , we establish the framework under some simple , yet general , conditions and postulates .",
    "the first natural question we need to answer is the following : what do we mean by a complex system ?    to answer this question , we extend the definition offered by freeman dyson to characterize evolution from a complex nucleus to a complex system @xcite ; to wit , we refer to a system as a _ complex system _ if it is characterized by many factors far too complicated to be understood in detail .",
    "similar to dyson s picture of a complex nucleus , we picture a complex system as a `` black box '' in which a large number of entities are interacting according to unknown physical laws .    in developing the framework , it is convenient to assume operators of finite but large dimensional space . in other words , rather than working with infinite dimensional operators in a hilbert space , we approximate the complex system by discretization , keeping only part of the hilbert space .",
    "this is the very first assumption wigner made in developing the random matrix theory @xcite . in this discretized matrix picture , the action of an operator @xmath6 in a vector space is characterized by a matrix product @xmath7 in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are elements of the vector space .    throughout this article , we use boldface lowercase letters to denote column vectors and boldface uppercase letters to denote matrices , with @xmath10 $ ] as the trace operator .",
    "we formalize the framework as follows : a complex system is composed of two types of counteracting entities , one working to stabilize the system and the other working to destabilize it .",
    "we refer to these stabilizing and destabilizing entities as ses and des , respectively .",
    "these notions will be mathematically characterized later .",
    "suppose the set of ses and des are constantly interacting .",
    "let @xmath11 be the state space .",
    "at any time , the state vector of these two types of entities is characterized by a nonzero @xmath1-dimensional random vector @xmath12 and a @xmath13-dimensional vector @xmath14 for @xmath15 , but we do not know whether @xmath12 or @xmath14 represents the ses or des state vector . to capture the dynamics of the complex system , we propose the following stochastic system of equations that couples the state vector of ses and des : @xmath16\\ , \\\\ & \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(t,\\omega)=\\phi(t,\\omega)\\ , [ \\mathbf{b}(t,\\omega)\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(t,\\omega)-\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(t,\\omega)+\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}(t,\\omega ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ , , \\label{system02}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19 and @xmath20 random matrices characterizing interactions between states @xmath12 and @xmath12 , respectively , and matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are diagonal matrices with diagonal elements of vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are considered to be multivariate white noise processes with each component having variance ( in general , time dependent ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . for a full account of deriving the system of equations ( [ system02 ] ) from the kolmogorov system of equations for population dynamics ,",
    "see supplementary materials , section i. having the state vector @xmath14 in determining the state vector @xmath12 in ( [ system02 ] ) , and vice versa , resembles the yin and yang nature of complex systems under study here .",
    "this philosophical view is not scientifically studied but as stated in ref.@xcite  as observed by chinese philosophers , the whole is made up of the yin and yang  complementary , interdependent , and conceptually opposing entities that comprise a whole \" .",
    "figure 1 symbolizes this philosophical belief in the context of a complex system with unboundedly many counteracting entities .    ): a pictorial representation of a complex system with",
    "unboundedly many counteracting entities working towards an equilibrium point . ]",
    "modeling interactions by random matrices is similar to may s assumption on randomness of interactions in a complex ecological system @xcite and similar to assuming randomness of hamiltonian in schrdinger s equation @xcite .",
    "the model proposed in equation ( [ system02 ] ) generalizes macarthur s consumer - resource model with self - limitation to a fully stochastic environment ( cf .",
    "@xcite section v ) ; in macarthur s consumer - resource model , the vector of abundance of consumer and resource species and all other parameters are deterministic .",
    "for some special cases of equation ( [ system02 ] ) in stochastic settings ( ref.@xcite , ch . 5 and p. 146 ) .",
    "one may also think of equation ( [ system02 ] ) as the generalization of lokta s prey - predator model to a stochastic setting ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite , p. 43 , and",
    "ref.@xcite p. 138 ) , or a generalization of flokker - planck equations to entities of two types",
    "one difference between the system of equations presented here and that of the flokker - planck model of ecological systems is that here we are coupling the state vector of ses and des on the left of the equation to the state vector of des and ses on the right , while in the flokker - planck model , the effect of model entities ( species ) are added to the white noise to determine the growth rate of the same type of entities .",
    "lokta describes two conceptions of equilibrium of a system  namely , a _ kinetic _ and an _ energetic _ conception of equilibrium ( see ref.@xcite , p. 143 ) .    _ * kinetic notion of equilibrium : * _ in this section , and for ease of notation , we omit @xmath27 from random vectors and matrices . from a kinetic perspective",
    ", equilibrium is a state at which certain velocities in an evolving system vanish . using this notion ,",
    "an equilibrium point is where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see ref.@xcite p. 143 and",
    "ref.@xcite p. 21 ) .",
    "having the zero velocity of state vector in equation ( [ system02 ] ) means @xmath30 in this regard , we consider two cases :    * _ case 1 , @xmath31 _ * : let us first consider equation ( [ system3 ] ) . given @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we first fix @xmath34 on the right and try to solve this equation for @xmath35 . since we have @xmath1 unknown and @xmath13 equations , this is an underdetermined system of equations and generally has an infinite number of solutions .",
    "now fix @xmath35 on the left and try to solve this equation for @xmath34 .",
    "since this is then an overdetermined system of equations , it is infinitely unlikely to have a solution ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "to summarize , for @xmath31 , this means that @xmath28 is not generally possible .",
    "note that this argument does not hold for equation ( [ system31 ] ) .",
    "given @xmath36 and @xmath37 , if we fix @xmath35 on the right , @xmath34 is well determined . at the same time , if we fix @xmath34 on the left , we end up with an underdetermined system of equations with possibly an infinite number of solutions .",
    "to summarize , for @xmath31 , the zero velocity principle only holds for equation ( [ system31 ] ) .",
    "@xmath38 this type of `` infinitely unlikely '' argument is inspired from macarthur and levins arguments made in ref.@xcite .",
    "* _ case 2 , @xmath39 _ * : using a similar argument to the one in case 1 , we see that the zero velocity conception of equilibrium only holds for equation ( [ system3 ] ) , which leads to @xmath40    _ * energetic notion of equilibrium * _ : the second conception is that a system is in equilibrium when certain functions having the dimensions of energy are _",
    "minimum_. the question arises as to whether the kinetic and the energetic notions of equilibrium can coexist . in ref.@xcite",
    ", macarthur showed that the state of an ecosystem at the kinetic equilibrium point of the competition equation is the point that minimizes a quadratic form , or , in other words , the energetic notion of equilibrium . nevertheless , the competition equation considered in ref.@xcite is fully deterministic .",
    "furthermore , an inherent assumption in the consumer - resource system of equations that he considered is that the number of resources and consumers is identical ( and finite ) , while here we assume they increase unboundedly with an arbitrary asymptotic ratio .",
    "therefore , we propose the following postulate :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * postulate 1 * : complex systems attempt to simultaneously reach both the kinetic and the energetic equilibrium points . _",

    "the system is not allowed to change the limiting point of @xmath41 .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed later to define an unrestricted point of equilibrium . without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath31 , in which case the zero velocity of states only holds for @xmath34 ; thus , the system of equations ( [ pkkl])-([pkl ] ) holds . since @xmath43 is possible , the system fixes values of @xmath44 , or makes them independent of time ( although still random w.r.t .",
    "@xmath27 ) . at the same time , equation ( [ system31 ] ) dictates the relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , once values of @xmath44 are fixed , there are infinite solutions for @xmath45 . from postulate 1 ,",
    "the system moves the state vector @xmath45 ( pick the solution ) that corresponds to the minimum energy , that is , the inner product of difference between a functional of fixed @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , since the parameters of equation ( [ system02 ] ) are all random , the minimization of energy takes place on average over all realizations of random parameters .",
