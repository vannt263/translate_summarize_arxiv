    "inflationary cosmology has solved many of the fundamental problems of the big bang model @xcite .",

    "the nearly flat , homogeneous , and isotropic universe , and the scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropies of the cmb , as well as the generation of primordial gravitational waves ( pgw ) , are all predictions of inflation .",
    "all of the above predictions ( with the possible exception of pgw ) have been confirmed by various cosmological observations .    similarly , magnetic fields are being observed in all kinds of galaxies and cluster of galaxies at wide range of redshifts .",
    "moreover , a lower bound , @xmath10 , has been reported for intergalactic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "planck , 2015 results constrains the upper limit to be of the order of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the commonly accepted model for the generation of galactic magnetic fields is the galactic dynamo @xcite .",
    "this model needs a seed field to start amplifying the magnetic field .",
    "also , it can not explain the existence of fields in the absence of a uniform rotating charged medium , like the magnetic fields indicated in voids .",
    "hence , such a detection may indicate a cosmological source of primordial origin .",
    "the generation of such a large scale primordial magnetic fields ( pmf ) is still an open question , see the reviews of this subject @xcite .",
    "however , one of the most interesting cosmological models is the simple @xmath0 model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has gained more interest because it is a stable model under perturbation .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein . ) also , it can lead to a scale invariant spectrum of pmf under the exponential potential model of inflation @xcite .",
    "the main difficulties with this model are the backreaction problem , where the scale of the associated electric field with pmf spectrum can exceed the scale of inflation itself @xcite , and the strong coupling between electromagnetic fields and charged matter at the beginning of inflation @xcite . in this case , if the electromagnetic field couples to charged matter , the physical charge associated with it is huge at the onset of inflation . for example , for the number of e - folds of inflation , @xmath12 , the physical electric charges ,",
    "such an absurdly large charge makes this model not viable .",
    "the starting point is the lagrangian of a scalar ( inflaton ) field @xmath9 coupled to the electromagnetic ( vector ) field @xmath14 @xcite which can be written as ,    @xmath15 } , \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath16 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath17 is the determinant of the spacetime metric @xmath18 .",

    "a lagrangian of a pure electromagnetic field would be of the form @xmath20 , but here we couple it to the scalar field through the unspecified function @xmath21 .",
    "the main reason behind this coupling is to break the conformal symmetry of electromagnetism and hence prevent the dilution of the seed of magnetic field as it is generated in the inflation era .",

    "results from the background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization ( bicep2 ) experiment were released @xcite .",
    "they reported the detection of the tensor mode ( b - mode ) polarization of temperature anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "the tensor to scalar ratio reported by bicep2 was @xmath27 , with @xmath28 disfavored at @xmath29 . also , the scale of inflation energy is close to the grand unified theory gut scale , @xmath30 .",
    "the results of bicep2 put many standard inflationary models in trouble @xcite . as a result ,",
    "non - standard models , such as large field inflation ( lfi ) @xcite , natural inflation ( ni ) @xcite models are a better fit with the bicep2 results .",
    "on the other hand , planck results released in sep 2014 @xcite cast serious doubts on the primordial origin of this polarization signal .",
    "these results of planck indicate that there is a significant contamination by dust over most of the high galactic latitude sky in the same region where bicep2 detected b - mode polarization .",
    "consequently , there is a good chance that the source of the observations reported by bicep2 is all galactic dust and not of primordial origin .",
    "finally , the joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck ( bk / p ) data was released on feb 2015 @xcite .",
    "the joint data of three probes eliminate the effect of dust contamination and show that the upper limit of tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath31 at 95% cl , and the gravitational lensing b - modes ( not the primordial tensor ) are detected in @xmath32[21 ] . similarly , the inflationary models are constrained based on the new analysis of data .",
    "the scalar spectral index was constrained by planck , 2015 to be @xmath33@xcite .",
    "consequently , the more standard inflationary models , like @xmath34-inflation , which result low value of @xmath35 , are the most favored one by planck , 2015 . however , the chaotic inflationary models like lfi and ni are disfavored @xcite .",
    "these results ruled out the first results of bicep2 , 2014 .    in this paper ,",

    "furthermore , there is a range of @xmath247 , and @xmath248 , at which the energy density of the electric field can even fall below the energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "again these values lie on the observable range of @xmath4 and the anticipated scale of @xmath249 .",
    "therefore , the problem of backreaction can be avoided in these ranges of values .",
    "however , the relatively short range of @xmath4 , presents a serious challenge to the viability of this model .",
    "one way to extend this research is to include the effect of reheating era and then to calculate the present value of pmf generated in ni as we do in the context of @xmath34-inflation @xcite .",
