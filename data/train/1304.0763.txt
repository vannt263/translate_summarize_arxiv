    "while type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have been used as precise distance indicators for nearly two decades @xcite , the nature of their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms is still unclear ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further information ) .",
    "while there is general acceptance that they are the result of the thermonuclear explosion of c / o white dwarfs ( wds ) , it is now likely that there are at least two major channels that lead to a sn  ia .",
    "the single - degenerate ( sd ) channel occurs when the wd accretes matter from a nondegenerate companion star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the double - degenerate ( dd ) channel is the result of the merger of two wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "extremely nearby sne  ia which were discovered soon after explosion have recently led to tight constraints on the size and luminosity of the companion star , thus ruling out many plausible sd scenarios for these objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the so - called super - chandrasekhar mass sne  ia are thought to contain @xmath5  m@xmath6  of sn ejecta and thus are likely formed from the dd scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . however , there are a few sne  ia that show strong evidence for the sd channel , possibly with a red giant ( rg ) companion .",
    "photoionization and subsequent recombination of circumstellar medium ( csm ) has been observed in relatively normal sne  ia @xcite , and csm has been detected in the spectra of at least 20% of sne  ia in spiral galaxies @xcite and has been linked to sn  ia explosion properties @xcite .    even greater interaction with csm has been seen in a small number of sne  ia whose spectra contain strong , narrow hydrogen emission and whose luminosities often exceed those of the more `` typical '' sne  ia that follow the light - curve decline rate versus peak luminosity correlation ( i.e.",
    ", the  phillips relation  ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these `` hybrid '' objects resemble type iin sne ( sne  iin ) and have been dubbed sne  ia / iin , ian , iia , and iian . under the standard sn classification scheme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , any sn with hydrogen features in its optical spectrum is considered a type ii sn and the subset of these showing relatively narrow emission lines are referred to as sne  iin .",
    "objects with relatively narrow hydrogen emission lines that are further linked ( spectroscopically ) to sne  ia could be denoted as `` type iina , '' though this moniker is somewhat cumbersome and obfuscating . therefore , in this work , we choose to label such events as `` sne  ia - csm '' ( or sometimes as `` ia - csm objects '' ) to highlight the connection to the physically distinct type ia class .",
    "sne  ia - csm have spectra which appear to be `` diluted '' sn  ia spectra with the aforementioned narrow hydrogen emission lines superposed ( leading to the sn  iin resemblance ) .",
    "their light curves are broad and quite long - lived , peaking at absolute magnitudes brighter than about @xmath7  mag .",
    "the two best - studied objects in this class are sne  2002ic and 2005gj @xcite . until recently there was some debate in the literature as to whether these objects are truly sne  ia or are in fact some strange flavor of core - collapse sn ( ccsn ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this possible controversy seems to have been settled by the discovery and analysis of ptf11kx ( @xcite ; silverman et al .",
    "submitted ) .",
    "this object was discovered by the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and shown to initially resemble the somewhat overluminous type ia sn  1999aa @xcite .",
    "optical spectra of ptf11kx soon developed a strong h@xmath0  feature with a p - cygni profile , eventually resembling spectra of sne  2002ic and 2005gj , the previously mentioned best - studied sne  ia - csm .",
    "using early - time data , @xcite find that ptf11kx was a _ bona fide _ sn  ia with a symbiotic nova progenitor ( i.e. , a sd scenario ) .",
    "analyzing late - time data , ( silverman et al .  submitted ) present further evidence that ptf11kx was a sn  ia that is strongly interacting with multiple thin csm shells .",
    "these findings can logically be extended to imply that _ all _ sne  ia - csm are likely to be real sne  ia with significant amounts of h - rich csm , possibly caused in part by a nondegenerate companion .    in  [ s : iacsm",
    "] we discuss our search for and identification ( or reidentification ) of previously known sne  ia - csm .",
    "most of these have not been studied in much detail before , and we present new spectra of many of them . similarly , in ",
    "[ s : ptf_iacsm ] , we discuss new sne  ia - csm discovered by ptf .  [ s : analysis ] contains the analysis of our spectra of all sne  ia - csm presented herein , in addition to the spectra of ptf11kx from @xcite and silverman et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "finally , we recap our conclusions in  [ s : conclusions ] and summarize the major observational characteristics shared by all sne  ia - csm .",
    "in order to find sne  ia - csm that may have previously been classified as sne  iin , we use the supernova identification code ( snid ; * ? ? ?",
    "snid classifies sn spectra by cross - correlating an input spectrum with a large database of observed sn spectra ( known as `` templates '' ) .",
    "to identify sne  ia - csm , we created a special set of spectral templates that consisted of all 310 spectra of 163 objects classified as sne  iin from the berkeley sn group s database @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , we also included templates of a handful of underluminous , overluminous , and normal sne  ia at a variety of epochs , as well as 27 spectral templates of the well - known ia - csm objects sne  2002ic and 2005gj ( mentioned in ",
    "[ s : intro ] ) .",
    "we then ran all of our spectra of ptf11kx and the previously known ia - csm objects sne  1999e , 2002ic , and 2005gj ( see   [ ss:02ic_05gj ] , [ ss:97cy_99e ] ) through snid using this newly created template set , making sure to ignore any templates made from the object currently under consideration .",
    "the best - matching templates for each of these known sne  ia - csm were visually inspected , and sne which were often found in the top 1020 best - matching templates were flagged for further examination .",
    "this yielded 18 possible sne  ia - csm . upon deeper analysis",
    ", it was found that many of the spectra matched those of sne  ia - csm and `` normal '' sne  iin equally well ; also , spectra of some objects had very low signal - to - noise ratios . while some of these may perhaps be true sne  ia - csm , we can not confidently claim this for most of them .",
    "thus , after this closer inspection was conducted , four of the 18 possible sne  ia - csm are convincingly part of the sn  ia - csm class .",
    "interestingly , all four of our `` newly discovered '' members of the sn  ia - csm class were noted to be similar to the prototypical ia - csm objects sne  2002ic and 2005gj , but only in unrefereed spectral classifications . from a literature search , no mention of these objects as sne  ia - csm is found anywhere else , except for sn  2008j which was studied by @xcite , work that was made public during the final stages of preparing this manuscript .",
    "adding these four objects to the prototypical sne  2002ic and 2005gj and to the less - studied , but still fairly well known ia - csm objects sne  1997cy and 1999e gives us a sample size of eight sne  ia - csm out of the hundreds of sne  iin discovered in the last @xmath1  15  yr .",
    "tables  [ t : iacsm ] and [ t : iacsm_host ] give basic information for all eight of these sne  ia - csm and their host galaxies , respectively , and our spectra of six of these sne are summarized in table  [ t : iacsm_spec ] .",
    "upon publication , all spectra presented in this paper will be available in electronic format on wiserep ( the weizmann interactive supernova data repository ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "it appears that sne  ia - csm _ must _ have an absolute optical magnitude in this range , roughly 0.51.5  mag brighter than their more normal sn  ia cousins , likely due to the interaction of the sn ejecta with the csm ( which gives sne  ia - csm their distinct spectra ) .",

    "these rise times can also be used to estimate the mass - loss rate of the progenitor system that gave rise to the csm . using typical sn  ia - csm ejecta and wind velocities of a few thousand and 100  km  s@xmath2 , respectively , and equations in @xcite",

    "<S> the spectra of all sne  ia - csm are dominated by h@xmath0  emission ( with widths of @xmath1  2000  km  s@xmath2 ) and exhibit large h@xmath0/h@xmath3 intensity ratios ( perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the sn ejecta overtaking slower - moving csm shells ) ; moreover , they have an almost complete lack of emission . they also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of h@xmath075100  d past maximum brightness , and nearly all sne  ia - csm exhibit strong  d absorption from the host galaxy . the absolute magnitudes ( uncorrected for host - galaxy extinction ) of sne  ia - csm are found to be @xmath4  mag , and they also seem to show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late times ( but no detected radio or x - ray emission ) . finally , the host galaxies of sne  ia - csm are all late - type spirals similar to the milky way , or dwarf irregulars like the large magellanic cloud , which implies that these objects come from a relatively young stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> this work represents the most detailed analysis of the sn  ia - csm class to date . </S>"
