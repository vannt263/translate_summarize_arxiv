    "labeling the modes l and r ( where l represents a mode that increases in frequency as the mechanical oscillator moves leftward , and r the opposite ) , we have equations of motion for the fields @xmath59 in this rotating frame : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the detuning between the @xmath62 pump laser and the cavity @xmath62 mode ( initially negative for our setup ) , @xmath63 are the input vacuum fields neglected in the classical analysis that follows , and @xmath8 is the operator representing the displacement of the mechanical oscillator along the cavity axis relative to the zero pump power position , which in general involves the motion of multiple mechanical modes .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath64 are measured in the experiment by observing the change of angular frequency for the cavity as a function of position of the membrane .",

    "the radiation pressure force is @xmath67 .",
    "note that for our system @xmath68 , and we similarly set @xmath69 for simplicity , neglecting potential dispersive effects .    when an optical system is pumped with a laser system , the behavior is best described by finding the classical steady state of the system and looking at fluctuations around that steady state . for simplicity , we start with the scenario where only the fundamental mechanical mode with spring constant @xmath70 is coupled to the optical system",
    ". we can look for the steady state of the driven system by solving the equations for coherent state amplitudes @xmath71 .",
    "this yields @xmath72 where @xmath32 is the steady - state position of the mechanical resonator .    to go from the cavity amplitudes to",
    "the full steady state requires examining both the cavity and the mechanical equations of motion . in practice ,",
    "our description must also include the action of the feedback electronics , particularly if we want to know about the dynamics of our system .",
    "fortunately , inclusion of the feedback can be included with a simple model with an additional degree of freedom @xmath73 representing the action of laser locking by the probe beams , which leads to slow feedback in the detunings of the pump fields .",
    "the equations become @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the feedback timescale , around 100 @xmath7s in the experiment , and @xmath76 is the bare detuning offset set by the eoms .    on very slow time scales ,",
    "the system goes to a steady state with @xmath77 ( enabling readout of the position of the resonator using the feedback circuit ) . in practice ,",
    "the effect of the feedback will be to double the optomechanical response in the system .",
    "the oscillator position is found by solving for the zero force condition @xmath78    for the symmetric case , finding the steady state corresponds to solving a surprising simple equation for zero force .",
    "the zero force condition becomes    @xmath79    this has the trivial ( low power ) solution @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , at higher power it admits additional solutions .    to examine the higher power solutions ,",
    "we define @xmath80 as a generalized position variable and @xmath81 as a variable proportional to the incoming optical power .",
    "note that @xmath82 ( red detuning ) for the experiment , and thus @xmath83 .",
    "the zero force condition has solutions in @xmath46 according to the quadratic equation : @xmath84 solutions to these equations provide the phase diagram shown in the main text .",
    "we examine which of these solutions is physical .",
    "we require @xmath32 to be real , or equivalently @xmath85 and real . if @xmath86 , only the positive solution @xmath87 , can satisfy @xmath88 . at the critical value of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and above this , @xmath46 continuously takes a non - zero value .",
    "this corresponds to the second - order phase transition as described in the main text , and can be understood as a double well potential for @xmath32    when @xmath91 , both branches may satisfy @xmath88 .",
    "the requirement of @xmath46 real is equivalent to @xmath92 , at which @xmath46 discontinuously takes a non - zero value .",
    "this corresponds to the first - order phase transition as described in the main text .",
    "this second regime corresponds to a triple well potential for @xmath32 , with the smaller solutions for @xmath93 unstable ( the peaks of the barriers between wells ) .",
    "thus , if we conceive of a non equilibrium phase diagram in which optical power is varied , for small detuning a second order phase transition will occur , while for larger detunings , a first order ( discontinuous change of @xmath32 as a function of @xmath94 ) transition occurs .",
    "one potential limit to stability for these systems is the detuning of the cavity modes becoming sufficiently modified by the transition to go from ` red ' to ` blue ' .",

    "in addition to the steady state solutions , we can examine the dynamical response of the system near its steady state . as our system is operating in the limit of cavity linewidth much greater than mechanical frequency",
    ", we anticipate that the dominant corrections to the bare resonator behavior take the form of the optical spring effect .",
    "formally , we can find this behavior via expansion of the equations of motion for small excursions from the steady state solutions . specifically , for equations of the motion of the form @xmath97 , such as those given in eqs .  1 - 2,4 - 6",
    ", we find the steady state @xmath98 and expand around it with @xmath99 .",

    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3h shows that as the pump power is raised , the frequency of the optically sprung resonator initially diminishes , and then rises above the frequency of the bare mechanical resonator as the system buckles . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the picture that the membrane transitions to a double - well potential from the sum of the mechanical and optical potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> curiously , the frequency of the mechanical mode does not go all the way to zero at the phase transition , as might be expected . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the limited bandwidth of the feedback electronics used to lock the probe lasers to the optical resonances . specifically , the opposite frequency dependence with position of the pump lasers and their associated probes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) results in a doubling of the optomechanical coupling for displacements within the bandwidth  ( @xmath53  khz ) of the feedback electronics , relative to displacements at substantially higher frequencies . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to the initial unbuckled state , two more stable positions appear discontinuously as the pump power is increased , indicating that the membrane now experiences an effective triple - well potential . </S>",
    "<S> this jump to a finite displacement of the membrane corresponds to a nonequilibrium first order phase transition . </S>",

    "<S> we note that the power levels chosen push into the nominally unstable region of the phase diagram for the large detuning data . the initial behavior in this unstable region , however , corresponds to a limit cycle behavior analogous to that of a duffing oscillator , leading to deviations in the experiment from the simple theoretical picture presented earlier , as the system wanders in a potential landscape with position - dependent gain and loss . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this fact , coupled with the feedback and the restriction of our theoretical model to a single mechanical mode , are responsible for the differences in the shapes of the experimental data in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> our system is in the classical regime , working at room temperature and with low quality factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low temperatures and high quality factor , a quantum phase transition may be observable in systems of this nature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , optomechanical systems can be made sufficiently cold  with a nominal dephasing rate slower than their resonance frequency  and sideband resolved to be laser cooled to their groundstate before buckling@xcite . then a rapid increase in pump power bringing the system across the transition could yield a transition driven entirely by quantum fluctuations , a macroscopic version of structural quantum phase transitions such as those in ion crystals@xcite .    in conclusion , we have realized an optomechanical system in which it is possible to force mechanical ( buckling ) phase transitions of the first or second kind , using the detuning as the control parameter and the optical power to effect the transition . </S>",
