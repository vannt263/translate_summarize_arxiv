    "in 1974 , fulton & dunkleberger @xcite demonstrated the way in which a biased josephson junction could be thermally excited from its zero voltage state .",
    "more precisely , they conducted experiments in which the bias current was steadily increased from zero towards its critical current .  in the absense of any noise , thermal or otherwise , the junction would not switch until the bias current reached the critical value .",
    "however , with thermal noise , junctions were observed to switch with high probability at bias currents that were slightly less than the critical value .",
    "this type of experiment has proven to be an extremely useful tool for probing the details of effective models of the junctions themselves",
    ".  later work by voss & webb @xcite extended the experiments to much lower temperatures and found what was interpreted to be evidence that the junction had entered a mode where an escape might be treated as macroscopic quantum tunneling  ( mqt ) out of the effective potential well associated with junction phase dynamics .",
    "once the idea of macroscopic quantum behavior for josephson junctions at low temperatures became accepted , the possibility of the manifestation of discrete quantum levels within the effective potential wells received attention .",
    "the first experiment to consider this propostion was reported by martinis , devoret and clarke ( mdc ) @xcite .  in that experiment , microwaves were directed onto a junction and the bias current was swept as before .",
    "the idea was that the microwaves would excite transitions from a lower to a higher level within the well , and that the macroscopic quantum variable - the junction phase - would then tunnel out of the well from that higher level , resulting in an escape from the zero voltage state .",
    "single and multiple peaks in the escape distributions of two samples were reported in their experiment .",
    "these data were interpreted as signatures of the anticipated level transitions dictated by quantum theory .",
    "previoisly we analyzed the issue of the classical resonant frequencies in wells under both harmonic and anharmonic approximations and found @xcite  that the classical theory gave results in good agreement with the experiments of mdc , suggesting that the classical resistive and capacitive shunted junction ( rcsj ) model for a josephson junction might have been dismissed prematurely in favor of the macroscopic quantum picture@xcite .",
    "the importance of the anharmonic component to the potential well is evident from the fact that a measurement of escape can not be realized in a harmonic well and , thus , one should not expect meaningful agreement between switching experiments and classical analysis of plasma oscillations .",
    "this notion was first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the anharmonic theory successfully compared to accompanying experiments on both direct and harmonic resonant switching .",
    "it should be mentioned that the anharmonic classical rcsj approach has since also produced good agreement with other experimentally observed features , such as rabi oscillations and ramsey fringes @xcite as well as tomographic reconstruction of anticipated density matrices for a pair of capacitively coupled josephson junctions @xcite , which originally had been interpreted exclusively in terms of quantum entanglement .    while the non - quantized rcsj model has proven to replicate the primary resonant features of the experiments , available experimental reports on switching during bias - sweep contain details not yet directly analyzed using the non - quantized approach .",
    "one is the saturation of the width of the switching distribution as the thermodynamic temperature is lowered , interpreted as a signature of a quantum crossover temperature @xcite ; another is the set of multiple of resonant switching peaks , interpreted as signatures of quantized energy transitions in the potential well @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the evidence for the macroscopic quantum tunneling interpretation of these experiments .  in particular , in the spirit of kramers statistical analysis @xcite , we develop a simple model of the swept - bias type of experiment based on classical thermal activation , and show that it gives an excellent accounting of the peaks observed in a number of key experiments .",
    "we consider josephson junctions to be characterized by a supercurrent @xmath0 with a critical current @xmath1 and junction phase @xmath2 , and a capacitance @xmath3 .",
    "the associated junction plasma frequency is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the flux quantum .",
    "we assume junctions whose physical dimensions are much smaller than the josephson penetration depth .    from this perspective , the phase dynamics of a single josephson junction subjected to a dc bias is equivalent to the motion of a particle on a washboard potential @xcite .",
    "the particle sits in a potential well which becomes shallower at high bias currents .",
    "this in turn leads to an enhanced probability of noise activated escape .",
    "if the bias current is swept from @xmath6 towards @xmath1 , then at some moment the junction will be observed to escape from its potential well and switch to a running state with finite voltage . in the experiments",
    "to which we will refer , this process was repeated many times in order to acquire a statistical profile of the distribution of bias currents for which the escapes from the zero - voltage state occur .    for our numerical simulations ,",
    "we imagine an equivalent scenario .",
    "suppose there is an ensemble of @xmath7  josephson junctions .",
    "the bias on all junctions starts at @xmath6 and is incremented in @xmath8 steps , with each step of duration @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sweep frequency .",
    "each step is assigned a channel and the total counts in that channel indicate how many junctions have switched to a finite voltage state ( escape from the potential well ) during that interval .",
    "as the bias sweep proceeds , the original ensemble will have lost @xmath11 junctions in the first interval , @xmath12 junctions in the second interval , and so forth .",
    "consequently , at the beginning of the @xmath13 bias interval , there will be @xmath14 junctions not yet escaped .",
    "the number from this remaining pool of junctions that will escape during the next @xmath15 seconds will be@xmath16   \\ \\gamma(t_{n})\\delta",
    "t,\\ n=2,3, ... n \\label{eq.1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the probability of escape per unit time in the @xmath13 interval ,  of course , the initial interval just satisfies@xmath18 equations ( [ eq.1],[eq.2 ] ) will mimic a swept - bias experiment provided a suitable expression is available for the escape rate @xmath19 .    in kramers theory @xcite",
    ", the thermal escape rate can be expressed@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the plasma frequency for the well specific to the @xmath13 bias interval and @xmath22  is the height of the potential barrier divided by the mean thermal energy .",
    "voss and webb @xcite assumed an escape rate in this form .",
    "however , there has been an ongoing discussion regarding the suitability of the kramers expression , and as devoret , esteve , martinis , cleland , and clarke @xcite , and others , have pointed out , a better equation for the escape rate , from bttiker , harris , and landauer ( bhl ) @xcite , is@xmath23 where @xmath24   ^{2 } } \\label{at}%\\ ] ] according to devoret _ _ et al.__@xcite , @xmath25 . in this expression , @xmath26 is a parameter that quantifies the dissipation in the junction ; the lower the dissipation , the larger the @xmath26 .",
    "_ @xcite noted : the prefactor depends only weakly on @xmath26  and , they consequently used an escape rate in the form of eq.([kramers ] ) .",
    "similarly , devoret _",
    "et al_. in @xcite stated that the value of the prefactor @xmath27 is close to unity .    for these reasons ,",
    "we proceed with our classical simulations of swept bias experiments using expression ( [ kramers ] ) for the escape rate .",
    "we shall consider the second - order effects of @xmath26 in section @xmath28 .    in the harmonic approximation@xmath29{1-\\eta_{n}^{2 } } \\label{harmonic}%\\ ] ] with @xmath30 being the normalized bias current within the @xmath13 bias interval .    combining these expressions , we obtain @xmath31{1-\\eta_{n}^{2}}\\right ]   \\exp\\left (   -\\frac{\\delta u_{n}}{k_{b}% t}\\right )   \\label{eq.4}%\\ ] ] which is required in eq.([eq.1 ] ) .",
    "the prefactor before the exponential represents the number of plasma oscillations that can fit within the time window of the @xmath13 data acquisition channel - that is , the number of attempts that will occur in that time window .    according to mqt theory at sufficiently low temperatures tunneling of the phase variable becomes the dominant escape mechanism , in which case the escape rate takes the form @xmath32",

    "voss and webb @xcite pointed out that the transition from classical to quantum behavior should take place around a `` crossover temperature '' satisfying @xmath34",

[ ptb ]    fig1.jpg2.ps    the evolution of the peaks shown in fig.[fig.1 ] is in very good agreement with the experimental data in fig.1 of voss and webb @xcite .  also shown in fig.[fig.1 ] is the single mqt peak from a simulation using the escape rate expression eq.([mqt ] ) with @xmath42 .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn is that when the value of @xmath43 drops below a crossover equivalent , macroscopic quantum behavior should take over from the classical escape process and the temperature independent peak marked mqt should become frozen in place .",
    "in such a case not only the peak widths but also the peak positions must remain constant .",
    "then , none of the classical peaks to the right of mqt would be observed in an experiment .    the crossover temperature , eq.([tcr ] ) , is a function of the natural frequency of a particular well , and this in turn is controlled by the applied bias current as specified in eq.([harmonic ] ) .",
    "therefore , in a swept - bias experiment one is also sweeping the natural frequency of the continuously varying well shape .",
    "it is simple to use eqs .",
    "( [ harmonic],[tcr ] ) to plot the dependence of crossover temperature on bias current ; this is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .    [ ptb ]    fig2.jpg2.ps    the positions ( bias values ) of the experimental peaks , indicated by solid dots , were manually extracted from fig.1 in @xcite using digitizing software @xcite .",
    "a vertical line marks the point at which the sample temperature has dropped below the crossover characteristic - this occurs at @xmath44 and a bias of @xmath45 . but note that the two experimental escape peaks for temperatures @xmath46 and @xmath47 are below the anticipated quantum transition temperature and appear not to have frozen at @xmath45 , but instead continue to advance beyond the mqt stopping point , into the shaded ` forbidden ' zone .",
    "while this progression of escape peaks towards higher bias values is contrary to the expectations of the mqt model , it is consistent with the classical escape model .",
    "the apparent saturation of the widths of the escape peaks below the crossover tempereature , noted in @xcite was claimed to constitute the `` first compelling evidence for the existence of quantum tunneling of a macroscopic variable '' . using digitizing software , the experimental data points for the peak widths",
    "were extracted from fig.3 in @xcite .",
    "these points are plotted in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.jpg2.ps    more than twenty years ago , cristiano and silvestrini @xcite proposed that the presence of some additional noise could raise the sample temperature above the bath temperature @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , they demonstrated that the observed temperature dependence of the peak widths in @xcite could be replicated using @xmath50 and with classical escape theory alone .",
    "such an elevated sample temperature , possibly due to self - heating , was also noted in @xcite    we have run our simulation with @xmath48 replaced by @xmath51 and @xmath50 and the results , virtually identical to those in @xcite , are shown in fig.[fig3 ] . by most standards",
    ", the agreement between experiment and classical theory is excellent .",
    "a vote in favor of a quantum signature in these data could only be supported by a much finer analysis including error bars in the experimental peak widths .",
    "as it stands , the classical model fits the experimental data exceptionally well over two orders of magnitude in bath temperature with the above - mentioned suggested effective sample temperature .",
    "we now consider appropriate modifications to the swept - bias model needed to take into account the action of applied microwaves . in such experiments ,",
    "a fixed frequency microwave source is used and the bias current is ramped up .",
    "our numerical solutions of the equation of motion of the phase @xcite with both dc and ac bias reveal induced oscillations around the minimum in the potential well .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations depends on the dc bias chosen",
    ".  there will be a particular bias , @xmath52 , at which the the oscillation amplitude is a maximum .",
    "the question is : what is the value for @xmath52 ?    in the harmonic approximation , the natural frequency of a well is related to the dc bias through eq.([harmonic ] ) .",
    "however as shown in @xcite , when the amplitude of the phase oscillations is large , the cubic nature of the well comes into play and an anharmonic approximation takes the place of eq.([harmonic ] ) ; it is.@xmath53 where @xmath54 is the bessel function of @xmath55th order , first kind and @xmath56 is the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "thus , the resonance frequency is depressed for increasing oscillation amplitudes @xmath56 .",
    "it has been found that situations , in which resonant states produce non - zero and non - unity switching probabilities , are given for oscillation amplitudes near the inflection point of the potential well . in the limit @xmath57 , this value of @xmath56 is given by the explicit expression @xmath58 .",
    "setting@xmath59 in eq.([harmonic ] ) would give one answer for the resonant bias @xmath52 , while eq .",
    "( [ anharmonic ] ) would give a slightly smaller answer .",
    "this means that without knowledge of the strength of the microwaves at the junction , the best one can say is that @xmath52 must lie somewhere below the value for @xmath60 ( as also seen experimentally in @xcite ) and in the vicinity of the interval spanned by the two values for @xmath60 and @xmath61 . as an example , for a microwave frequency @xmath62 , the limits of @xmath52 are : @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ".    let the amplitude of the induced phase oscillation to the right of the minimum point of any well be denoted @xmath65 . for not too large excitations , @xmath66 has a bell - shaped distribution , centered at @xmath52 . at @xmath52",
    "the ac field is transferring a maximum amount of energy into the junction . on either side of this optimum bias , the amplitude of the phase oscillations diminishes and the absorbed energy declines . for a bell shaped distribution of @xmath66 we used the following heuristic expression , @xmath67 there are two parameters here : @xmath68 which sets the sharpness of the distribution , and @xmath69 which sets the peak value .    whenever sustained phase oscillations are induced , the added energy is@xmath70",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\left .",

    "this will _ reduce _ the escape barrier in the @xmath13 interval to an effective value@xmath73 and this is what thermal noise needs to overcome .",
    "this effective barrier height replaces the original in eq.([eq.4 ] ) and then the simulation can proceed as before .",
    "we now apply this simulation to several sets of published data .",
    "first we consider experiments which showed only a single microwave induced escape peak .",
    "as noted already , swept bias experiments yield histograms for the escape probability .",
    "some authors prefer to convert such data to escape rates @xmath19 as a function of bias current",
    ". then a _ relative rate _ , with and without microwaves , @xmath74   /\\gamma(0)$ ] may be plotted .",
    "this has the effect of stripping away the thermal escape peak ( as discussed in sections 3 & 4 ) , thereby isolating purely microwave induced phenomena .",
    "consider the results presented in martinis , devoret , and clarke @xcite .",
    "their fig.3 is reproduced in the upper panel of fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the junction was characterized by the following parameter values : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this gives a junction zero bias plasma frequency @xmath77 ; hence the microwave frequencies of @xmath78and @xmath79 correspond to @xmath80 and @xmath81 in dimensionless form .",
    "this experiment was carried out at @xmath82 .    for comparison of these experiments with classical results , we simply make use of the escape rate expression eq.([kramers ] ) with a barrier given by eq.([eq.5 ] ) in the absense of microwaves , or with a reduced effective barrier given by eq.([ueff ] ) when microwaves are present . for each of the four microwave frequencies , the anharmonic result eq.([anharmonic ] )",
    "was used to obtain the bias current @xmath52 which selects the well that is resonant with the excitation . with this normalized bias , eq.([eq.7 ] ) together with eq.([dphi ] ) permits the reduced barrier height to be calculated .",
    "the remainder of the parameters chosen to match the situation were : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the results for the classical escape rate calculations are shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig4 ]    [ ptb ]    fig4.jpg2.ps    as can be seen , the classical results agree very well with the experimentally observed peaks in the escape rates for these four microwave frequencies .",
    "et al_. @xcite carried out swept - bias experiments on a josephson junction characterized by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the josephson plasma frequency was thus @xmath88 .",
    "the escape probability distributions were measured at several different combinations of temperature and microwave frequency , as shown in the upper panel of fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig5.jpg2.ps    for the classical simulations , the parameter values were : @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( equivalent to a half width in the distribution of @xmath91 ) and from top to bottom , @xmath92 .",
    "the simulation results clearly are in very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "note that the ac resonance and the thermal peak are nearly on top of each other , so the peaks almost merge .",
    "also , the simulation exhibits the same shifting effect as in the experiments - the thermal peak without microwaves becomes displaced slightly towards lower bias values when the microwaves are turned on .      every swept bias experiment with microwaves present yields at least one ac induced escape peak .",
    "this includes both figs.2 and 3 in @xcite , fig.3 in @xcite , fig.2 in @xcite , and fig.6.5 in @xcite .",
    "but only in two instances was a second microwave peak in evidence .",
    "in fig.2 , of @xcite , one of the experimental samples exhibited an additional microwave escape peak .",
    "for that experiment , the sample parameters were : @xmath93 , @xmath94 and so @xmath95 .",
    "hence the normalized microwave frequency of @xmath96 was @xmath97 .",
    "the two peaks were at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which in normalized units are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these two points are included in fig.[fig6 ] ; they are both quite close to the anharmonic curve .    in fig.3 of @xcite , there are two microwave induced escape peaks.the sample parameters were : @xmath102 , @xmath103 yielding a junction plasma frequency @xmath104 .",
    "the microwave frequency was @xmath105 which is @xmath106 in normalized units .",
    "the two peaks are at bias currents of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which in normalized units are @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "these two points are included in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "interestingly , one appears to be on the anharmonic curve , while the other is close to the harmonic curve , perhaps suggesting that the system can resonantly respond to either condition .",
    "the possibility for multiple states in the ac driven anharmonic potential is consistent with previously reported observations ( see fig.1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the solid line berkley s fig.3 was described as a lorentzian fit to two peaks , meaning it is not in any sense a theoretical prediction and so does not constitute confirmation of quantum expectations .",
    "the labelling of the two peaks as @xmath111 and @xmath112 is based on assumptions regarding applicable physics .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig6.jpg2.ps    in the previous section , it was noted that the four single peaks , each at a different microwave frequency , from fig.3 of @xcite are reasonably reproduced by classical calculations of relative escape rates .",
    "these classical points are shown in fig.[fig6 ] as diamonds that lie along the anharmonic curve .",
    "however , the comparison of experiment with classical and quantum theories described in @xcite contained the statement : furthermore , the measured positions of the resonances are clearly very different from a classical prediction for the resonant activation of the particleoscillating at the plasma frequency ( dashed line ) .",
    "this dashed line appears in part ( b ) of the figure and is in fact the harmonic approximation .",
    "but we see from our fig.[fig6 ] that the fair test of the classical model is the anharmonic approximation , and at the very least the classical model is as successful as the quantum hypothesis .",
    "it is important to note that peaks in the escape probability distributions are not like lines in atomic spectra in that they are a manifestation of both the fundamental physics associated with escape rates and the way the experiment is performed - specifically , the frequency at which the bias current is swept from zero to its critical value , ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig7.jpg2.ps    this issue was addressed in a swept bias simulation with : @xmath113 , @xmath39 , @xmath114 , @xmath41 and @xmath115 .",
    "the results for microwaves off are shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "clearly , the exact location and shape of the thermal escape peak are determined in part by the speed with which the bias current is ramped towards the critical value . as might be anticipated , increasing the sweep rate moves the peak towards higher bias currents .",
    "to illuminate some aspects of the effects of dissipation , we carried out swept bias simulations using eqs .",
    "( [ gammabhl ] ) and ( [ at ] ) , and for this example with parameters @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .  the microwave frequency for the was set at @xmath119 and the assumed excitation parameters were @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "typical values of the dissipation @xmath26 for underdamped josephson junctions lie in the range @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "escape histograms were repeated for a number of choices of the dissipation constant parameter and the results are shown in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig8.jpg2.ps    note that the microwave peak does not shift , but the position of the purely thermal peak varies with @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the particular value of the junction dissipation might have a slight effect on predictions of the voss & webb type of experiment , but would not influence the positions of microwave induced peaks .",
    "the decades old papers of voss and webb , and martinis _ et al .",
    "_  appeared to convincingly demonstate the ( anticipated ) appearance of mqt in superconducting circuits operating below a crossover temperature .",
    "the classical model was subsequently discarded as a possible source for observed phenomena at millikelvin temperatures .  in this paper",
    "we have shown that this assertion may not be justified , and that these early foundational experiments can certainly be modeled successfully within a purely classical device description .",
    "with respect to the experiments of voss and webb , we have demonstrated that there was not strong evidence that the junction had entered a macroscopic quantum state even at the lowest temperatures .",
    "a classical model with some self - heating gives a more consistent description of those observations .",
    "with respect to the experiments of martinis _",
    "et al_. , we have demonstrated that in the presence of microwave irradiation the additional peaks which appear in the swept bias escape distributions are just as well accounted for within the classical resonant activation model as by the proposed macroscopic quantum model .",
    "the key issue in this situation was nicely expressed by devoret , martinis , and clarke @xcite as follows : an experiment can not prove a theory , but only invalidate an alternative theory .. the present study should therefore be seen in this context - the classical theory for these systems has not yet been ruled out .",
