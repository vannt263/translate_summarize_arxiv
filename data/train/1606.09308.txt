    "in many applications , it is of interest to identify anomalous behavior among the actors in a time - varying network .",
    "for example in online social networks , sudden increased communications often signify illegal behavior such as fraud or collusion @xcite .",
    "anomalous changes like these are reflected by local structural changes in the network .",
    "the goal of network monitoring is to provide a surveillance plan that can detect such structural changes .",
    "network monitoring techniques have been successfully utilized in a number of applications , including the identification of central players in terrorist groups @xcite , and the detection of fraud in online networks @xcite . as available data",
    "has become more complex , there has been a recent surge of interest in the development and application of scalable network monitoring methodologies ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate monitoring the interactions of a fixed collection of @xmath0 actors @xmath1 = \\{1 , \\ldots , n\\}$ ] over discrete times @xmath2 . in general , an interaction",
    "is broadly defined and may represent , for example , communications in an online network @xcite , citations in a co - authorship network @xcite , or gene - gene interactions in a biological network @xcite .",
    "we model the interactions of these actors at time @xmath3 by a @xmath4 stochastic adjacency matrix @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the discrete random variable that represents the number of interactions between actor @xmath7 and actor @xmath8 at time @xmath3 .",
    "our goal is to develop a surveillance strategy to detect communication outbreaks among a subset of actors @xmath9 $ ] at time @xmath3 .",
    "the identification of outbreaks among a subset of actors @xmath10 corresponds to detecting sudden increases in the collection of edges @xmath11 . when the team is unknown , monitoring can be computationally expensive due to the need for identifying candidate teams .",
    "for example , consider a simple case where we know the size of the target team is @xmath12 .",
    "an exhaustive monitoring of all teams of size @xmath13 requires a procedure of complexity @xmath14 , which is infeasible even for moderately sized networks . as social networks are generally large , e.g. @xmath0 is on the order of 1 million for online networks like those represesenting facebook or twitter , exhaustive searches are not practical in real - time . to address this challenge , we propose a computationally efficient local surveillance strategy that monitors the interactions of densely connected neighborhoods through time .",
    "our proposed strategy has computational complexity of order @xmath15 , and provides a viable strategy for large networks .",
    "our surveillance procedure consists of two steps , which can be briefly described as follows .",
    "first , we smooth the communication counts across all pairs and time using a multivariate adaptation of the exponentially weighted moving average ( ewma ) technique for smoothing poisson counts . by monitoring the smoothed counts ,",
    "our strategy is robust to sudden random oscillations in the observed count process .",
    "next , candidate teams are identified locally for each node using a neighborhood - based approach . in particular , at time @xmath3 we define a candidate team for node @xmath16 $ ] as one that contains larger than expected communication .",
    "surveillance plans for these candidate teams are developed using appropriate generalizations of the multivariate ewma statistic .",
    "we develop surveillance plans using the above technique in general for _ heterogeneous _ dynamic networks @xmath17 , where we suppose that the expected communication counts are possibly different for each pair and time , namely , @xmath18 = \\lambda_{i , j , t}$ ] .",
    "we consider three situations describing the team @xmath10 :    * _ collaborative teams _ : members of @xmath10 communicate with one another far more than they communicate with actors outside of the team . * _ dominant leader teams _ : the members of @xmath10 have a dominant leader @xmath19 who communicates frequently with members of @xmath10 , but the members of @xmath10 themselves do not necessarily communicate frequently amongst themselves . * _ global outbreaks _ : the entire network undergoes a communication outbreak , namely @xmath20 $ ] .    scenarios ( i ) and ( ii ) are considered for both unknown and known teams .",
    "each of the scenarios are also considered for homogeneous networks , where @xmath18 \\equiv \\lambda$ ] . by investigating both a test bed of simulated networks as well as a real network describing the u.s .",
    "senate voting patterns , we find that our surveillance strategy can efficiently and reliably detect significant changes in dynamic networks .",
    "the most closely related work to our current manuscript is that introduced in @xcite . in that paper",
    ", the authors also consider monitoring changes in communication volume between subgroups of targeted people over time .",
    "their approach evaluates pairwise communication counts and determines whether these have significantly increased using a p - value , which assesses the deviation of the communication rate at time @xmath3 and what is considered normal behavior . here",
    ", normal behavior is modeled using conjugate bayesian models for the discrete - valued time series of communications up to time @xmath3 .",
    "while their focus is detecting changes on the entire network , our approach considers detecting communication outbreaks for members of a small team within the dynamic network .",
    "there are other model - based network monitoring approaches that have been recently developed , which we briefly describe here .",

    "to detect anomalies , the authors used the ghrg as a null model to compare observed graphs in @xmath21 , t)$ ] via a bayes factor , which is calculated using bootstrap simulation .",
    "@xcite proposed modeling and estimating change in a sequence of networks using the dynamic degree - corrected stochastic block model ( dcsbm ) .",
    "in that work , maximum likelihood estimates of the dcsbm are used for monitoring via shewhart control charts .",
    "our model is similar to the dcsbm in that edges are modeled as having discrete - valued edge - weights , which flexibly model communications in social networks .",
    "the ewma control chart is a popular univariate monitoring technique .",
    "the multivariate ewma process that we use here is a generalization of the univariate ewma strategies for poisson counts considered in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a related multivariate ewma control chart has previously been successfully applied to space - time monitoring of crime @xcite .",
    "our specified dynamic network model for @xmath17 is related to several well - studied random graph models , which are ubiquitous in social network analysis .",
    "for example , when @xmath6 are independent and identically distributed @xmath22 random variables , the graph at time @xmath3 is an erds - rnyi random graph model with edge connection probability @xmath23 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath6 are independent @xmath24 random variables , graph @xmath3 is a weighted variant of the chung - lu random graph model @xcite .",
    "random graph models play an important role in the statistical analysis of relational data .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ewma ] , we describe how to smooth the observed communication counts using multivariate ewma smoothing . in section [ sec : surveillance ] we develop surveillance strategies for communication outbreaks among small teams of actors in a dynamic network when the target team is known .",

    "senate voting patterns from the 35th to the 113th congress .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our findings and discuss directions for future work in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "throughout this work , we are concerned with detecting significant increases in communication among the members of some subset of actors @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "such fluctations correspond to sudden spikes in the collection of edge weights @xmath11 . in many cases ,",
    "the communication counts @xmath25 , t = 1 , \\ldots , t\\}$ ] are prone to random fluctuations that arise from noise in the observed process .",
    "if not accounted for , direct monitoring of counts may lead to false discovery . to reduce this possibility",
    ", we smooth the observed counts using a reflective ewma strategy @xcite .",
    "to begin , we first obtain a collection of smoothed values @xmath26 , t = 1 , \\ldots , t\\}$ ] using an ewma strategy .",
    "fix @xmath27 $ ] , and define    @xmath28    denote the expected value of @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "the expected values of these smoothed counts can be calculated using the following recursion    @xmath31    in the above recursion , the initial values are set as @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 acts as a smoothing parameter that dictates the temporal memory retained in the stochastic process @xmath26 , t = 1 , \\ldots , t\\}$ ]",
    ". large values of @xmath33 retain less memory and result in less smoothing . in our applications , we fix @xmath33 to 0.075 based on the previous analysis and suggestion of @xcite .",
    "notably , the ewma in ( [ eq : ewma1 ] ) will not reflect a change in the observed count process in the scenario that @xmath6 decreases immediately before a significant ( anomalous ) increase . to avoid this worst - case scenario , we use the reflective boundary ewma process @xmath34 , t = 1 , \\ldots , t\\}$ ] , defined by    @xmath35",
    "the reflective boundary ewma specified in ( [ eq : ref_ewma ] ) is robust to sudden oscillations in the count process .",
    "our surveillance plans will utilize the smoothed counts from ( [ eq : ref_ewma ] ) rather than the originally observed counts .",
    "we begin by considering the simplest case when the target team @xmath10 is known _ a priori_. this scenario arises , for example , in the surveillance of the communication among a known active group of terrorists in a large terrorist network .",
    "we develop surveillance plans for collaborative and dominant leader teams , as well as global changes , where the entire network undergoes a communication outbreak . for each of these scenarios we describe monitoring a homogeneous sequence of networks @xmath36 , where the collection of expected communications @xmath37 , t = 1,\\ldots , t\\}$ ] are such that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and @xmath3 , and further describe how to extend the plans in this regime to the more general heterogeneous case , where expected communications are possibly different accross time and actor pairs . in both",
    "this section and section [ sec : estimating ] , we will make use of two tunable parameters ",
    "$ ] : a smoothing parameter that controls the extent to which a proposed ewma statistic has temporal memory , and @xmath40 : threshold functions that are chosen to control false discovery of the proposed monitoring plan .",
    "we fix @xmath41 based on previous analysis conducted in @xcite .",
    "the threshold functions @xmath40 are chosen via simulation of the monitored process .",
    "we describe how these are chosen in detail in the appendix .    throughout this and the following section ,",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath42 be the ewma and reflective boundary ewma defined in ( [ eq : ewma1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ref_ewma ] ) , respectively .",
    "further , we denote @xmath43 as the number of individuals in the team .",
    "we first consider monitoring for outbreaks among a collaborative team @xmath10 , wherein all members of @xmath10 are expected to communicate regularly .",
    "an outbreak in a collaborative team is reflected by a large average number of communications between members @xmath44 .",
    "to detect such outbreaks , we analyze the mean , @xmath45 , of the smoothed interactions in the collection defined as    @xmath46 = \\sum_{i \\in \\omega_t } \\sum_{j \\in \\omega_t } \\widetilde{\\lambda}_{i , j , t}\\ ] ]    in the case that @xmath36 is homogeneous , note that @xmath47 .",
    "we use a group - ewma ( gewma ) statistic to identify outbreaks among the actors in @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath48 process is defined by the following recursion    @xmath49    where the initial value @xmath50 .",
    "for homogeneous networks , we use the @xmath48 process from ( [ eq : gewma ] ) and flag an outbreak within the team @xmath10 when    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is designed to give the plan a low false discovery rate .",
    "importantly , the square root transform of the @xmath48 process in ( [ eq : gewma_flag3 ] ) stabilizes the variance of the process to a constant value ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the left hand side of ( [ eq : gewma_flag3 ] ) is no longer a function of the mean @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , we find from simulation that the threshold @xmath52 is _ not _ a function of @xmath23 ; hence , even in the heterogeneous case we can use a plan with the threshold @xmath53 .",
    "we describe how to choose the value @xmath53 in the appendix .",
    "thus for heterogeneous networks , we flag an outbreak in the team @xmath10 when    @xmath54    in practice , a target team @xmath10 may purposefully reduce their communication levels prior to , say , planning a crime , which may hamper early detection when using the @xmath48 statistic defined in ( [ eq : gewma ] ) . to avoid this scenario , one can alternatively use a reflective boundary gewma statistic defined as    @xmath55    and apply an analogous plan as defined in ( [ eq : gewma_flag2 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the scenario in which the target team @xmath56 has a known dominant leader @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we expect that @xmath19 will have a high level of communication with the members of @xmath56 , but unlike the collaborative team setting , the members of @xmath56 do not neccessarily significantly interact with one another . in this case , an outbreak is signalled when there is either a significant rate of communications between @xmath19 and the members of @xmath56 , or by a significant rate of interactions among the members of @xmath10 .",
    "as we primarily need to be concerned with the communications between a single actor and a collection of actors , we develop a monitoring strategy that exploits sparsity in the interactions among the members of @xmath56 . at time @xmath3 , we monitor only the collection of actors that ( a ) significantly communicate with the dominant leader @xmath19 , and ( b ) significantly communicate with one another . that is , we identify the dominant leader team @xmath56 by following two steps .",
    "first we identify the team @xmath58 that contains all individuals in @xmath1 $ ] with a significant number of interactions with @xmath19 , namely    @xmath59 : \\sqrt{y^{*}_{\\nu , i , t } + y^*_{i , \\nu , t } } - \\sqrt{\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\nu , i , t } + \\widetilde{\\lambda}_{i,\\nu , t } } > k\\}.\\ ] ]    next we refine the team @xmath60 to include only those members who share a significant number of communications .",
    "we set    @xmath61    the value @xmath62 is a suitable constant that helps identify members of the target group and is chosen to control the size of the team @xmath56 .",
    "we consider the choice of @xmath62 in our simulation study in section [ sec : simulations ] . to monitor @xmath56",
    ", we use the dominant leader ewma ( dewma ) statistic , defined as    @xmath63    when @xmath19 is known , we can use the dewma statistic from ( [ eq : dewma ] ) to flag outbreaks in a dominant leader team . in the case that @xmath36 is homogeneous , we flag an outbreak when    @xmath64    above , @xmath65 is chosen to control false discovery .",
    "once again simulations suggest that the square root transformation rids the dependence of the threshold @xmath65 on @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we use the following general surveillance plan for heterogeneous networks when @xmath19 is known    @xmath66    we note that when the team and dominant leader are both unknown , the plan in ( [ eq : dewma_flag ] ) is complicated by the fact that we must estimate @xmath19 and @xmath10 .",
    "we discuss our strategy to handle this in section [ sec : estimating ] .",
    "we now consider the case when there is a significant increase in the number of interactions among every pair of actors in the network , i.e. , when @xmath20 $ ] for all @xmath3 .",
    "one can generally detect this anomaly early by monitoring the aggregated interactions over the target network . to monitor the network for a global outbreak , one can directly extend the @xmath48 statistic from ( [ eq : gewma ] ) to the entire network .",
    "note that in the case that @xmath20 $ ] , we have from ( [ eq : mean ] ) that @xmath67 } = \\sum_{i \\in [ n ] } \\sum_{j \\in [ n ] } \\widetilde{\\lambda}_{i , j , t}$ ] . following our previous development of the @xmath48 statistic in ( [ eq : gewma ] ) , we define the total - ewma ( tewma ) statistic using the following recursion    @xmath68 } \\sum_{j \\in [ n ] } \\widetilde{y}_{i , j , t}+ ( 1-\\alpha ) ~ \\text{tewma}_{t-1 } , ~ \\mu_{[n]}\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 } \\sum_{j \\in [ n ] } \\widetilde{y}_{i , j,1}$ ] , and @xmath27 $ ] is chosen to smooth the tewma process . using the statistic in ( [ eq : tewma ] )",

    "in many applications , @xmath10 is _ not _ known _ a priori_. in this situation , there are two primary difficulties that one must address .",
    "first , the unknown team must be efficiently estimated . an exhaustive search for an anomalous team",
    "has complexity of order @xmath75 ; thus , it is important to employ scalable approaches for estimation .",
    "when @xmath10 is known , the @xmath48 and @xmath76 statistics are invariant to variations in the communication means .",
    "however , when @xmath10 is unknown these statistics are no longer invariant to heterogeneous communication rates through time .",
    "thus the second complication comes in adapting the monitoring plan for a changing mean in heterogeneous networks . in this section",
    "we describe a local search strategy to identify densely connected teams on which our proposed statistics can be used for monitoring .",
    "since the global outbreak plan in ( [ eq : tewma_flag3 ] ) is invariant to mean changes , we only need to consider the scenarios when @xmath10 is either a collaborative team or a dominant leader team .      here",
    ", we describe our local search strategy to estimate collaborative teams as well as teams with a dominant leader .",
    "when the target team is unknown and collaborative , we propose monitoring a collection of densely connected teams @xmath77\\}$ ] at each time @xmath3 .",
    "we define a candidate team @xmath78 as one in which all constituent members significantly interact . in particular",
    ", for each @xmath79 $ ] and each time @xmath3 , we identify the candidate team    @xmath80 : \\sqrt{y^*_{i,\\ell , t } } - \\sqrt{\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{i,\\ell , t } } > k , \\text{or } ~ \\sqrt{y^*_{\\ell , i , t } } - \\sqrt{\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\ell , i , t } } > k\\}.\\ ] ]    above , @xmath62 is a suitable constant with good detection properties and is chosen via simulation .",
    "our specification of each candidate team @xmath78 is motivated by empirical properties of real networks .",
    "one can view @xmath78 structurally as a hub with center node @xmath81 .",
    "hub structures commonly arise in sparse social and biological networks as well as the well - studied scale - free family of networks @xcite .",
    "thus if the unknown team is suspected to be a collaborative team , we propose monitoring at most @xmath0 densely connected teams .      when the dominant leader @xmath19 and target team @xmath10 is unknown , we monitor a collection of candidate dominant leader teams @xmath82\\}$ ] at each time @xmath3 . like the identification of dominant leader teams in section [ sec : surveillance ]",
    ", we identify a collection of candidate dominant leader teams that have a significantly large rate of communication .",
    "first for a fixed leader @xmath57 $ ] we identify a team @xmath83 by finding all individuals in @xmath1 $ ] with a significant number of interactions with @xmath19 given by    @xmath84 : \\sqrt{y^{*}_{\\nu , i , t } + y^*_{i , \\nu , t } } - \\sqrt{\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\nu , i , t } + \\widetilde{\\lambda}_{i,\\nu , t } } > k\\}\\ ] ]    we next refine the team @xmath85 to include only those members who share a significant number of interactions .",
    "namely , we specify the team @xmath86 as    @xmath87    the value @xmath62 is a suitable constant that helps identify members of the target group with larger than expected communications with the dominant leader @xmath19 .",
    "we note that rather than a normal standardized score to identify @xmath56 , we use a signal - to - noise team identification scheme in ( [ eq : dewma_team1 ] ) as this strategy can efficiently avoid unusual changes that involve very low communication levels .",
    "once the candidate teams @xmath88\\}$ ] and @xmath89\\}$ ] have been estimated for each time @xmath3 , we can develop a monitoring plan . for @xmath90 $ ] ,",
    "define the following local gewma and dewma statistics    @xmath91    @xmath92    when the observed network is homogeneous , one can readily monitor collaborative and dominant leader teams by using plans ( [ eq : gewma_flag2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dewma_flag2 ] ) , respectively , for the local gewma and dewma statistics in ( [ eq : gewma_local ] ) and ( [ eq : dewma_local ] ) .",
    "when the network is heterogeneous , we develop an adaptive plan for surveillance as follows .",
    "note that for a fixed candidate collaborative team @xmath78 , the plan in ( [ eq : gewma_flag2 ] ) can be re - expressed as    @xmath93    importantly the threshold in plan ( [ eq : flag_gewma ] ) no longer depends on the observed data .",
    "we exploit this property and define an adaptive plan using the local adaptive group - ewma ( agewma ) statistic :    @xmath94    for an unknown team @xmath10 , a communication outbreak is flagged when    @xmath95    for any @xmath79 $ ] . here , the team must be re - estimated at each time period @xmath3 .",
    "this adaptive plan in ( [ eq : agewma ] ) has the same in - control ats value used to design the homogeneous plans for all @xmath96 .",
    "we can use a similar adaptive plan to identify communication outbreaks in candidate dominant leader teams . define the local adaptive dominant leader - ewma ( adewma ) statistic by    @xmath97    using an analagous argument as above for the adaptive gewma plan , we flag a communication outbreak among dominant leader teams when    @xmath98    for any @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "there are two distinct scenarios in which an outbreak will be flagged by the plan ( [ eq : adewma ] ) . in the first scenario ,",
    "an outbreak is detected if the team size of any candidate team significantly increases .",
    "this is likely to happen when , for instance , a leader of an organized crime is trying to recruit a team . in the second scenario , an outbreak is detected when the number of interactions within any candidate team significantly increases .",
    "this can occur in two ways : ( i ) when individuals within the same team interact more with individuals outside of their current group , or ( ii ) members of the group interact significantly more frequently among themselves .",
    "combinations of ( i ) and ( ii ) may also flag communication outbreaks .",
    "we now access the utility of our proposed surveillance plans on a test bed of simulated networks .",
    "we consider two types of communication outbreaks among small target teams . in the first scenario ,",
    "we simulate a collaborative team outbreak , where every actor in a small and unknown team is involved in the outbreak . in the second scenario ,",
    "the target team has an unknown dominant leader whose communication levels with the remaining team undergoes an outbreak .",
    "for each of these cases , we investigate the effectiveness of the gewma and dewma strategies .    for each simulation , we generate 100 in - control networks followed by 500 networks that have undergone an outbreak .",
    "we record the time to signal - the number of networks after the change until a signal is flagged - of the dewma and gewma plans and repeat the experiment 10000 times for the collaborative team outbreak and 1000 times for the dominant leader outbreak . to evaluate the performance of a plan , we record the average time to signal ( ats ) over the collection of simulations .",

    "we assume the following specifications of team behavior :    1 .   in order to plan a crime",
    ", team members should call each other at least 0.5 per day during the planning phase .",
    "we consider this to be the lowest level of communication necessary to plan a crime .",
    "the planning stage of the crime would result in at least a doubling of their usual communication intensity during this planning stage .",
    "the usefulness specification is that detection should be well within 7 days of the start ( i.e. , the out - of - control ats @xmath120 7 ) .",
    "the last specification allows law enforcement agencies enough time for appropriate detective work to be carried out and potentially avoid catastrophic events such as terrorism .",
    "the optimal plan for @xmath121 and 0.7 pass the usefulness test by flagging within seven days on average for all groups ( e.g. , with @xmath121 , k = 0.6 the @xmath48 statistics detect the outbreak on average in 6.93 days ) .",
    "on the other hand , when the overall communication in the network is relatively sparse ( @xmath122 ) , this fit for purpose test is only met for collaborative teams having 8 or more members .",
    "we now investigate the performance of the gewma and dewma plans when the outbreak occurs among a fixed but unknown dominant leader team in a homogeneous dynamic network .",
    "we simulate the networks with the same specifications as the collaborative team study in section [ sec : collaborative ] , except now the outbreak only occurs on a fixed subset of communications in the team ( rather than throughout the entire team as in the collaborative team scenario ) . in particular , we consider four different dominant leader teams where a communication outbreak occurs on the directed edges shown in figure [ fig : dominant_leader_sims ] . in each of these four teams , team member 6",

    ", we seek an adewma plan that delivers an ats of 100 . we note that one could alternatively seek an ats of 370 to match the standard three sigma strategy of shewhart control charts , but the choice is arbitrary .",
    "we vary the values of @xmath132 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 and identify the threhold adjustment that acquires the desired ats over 1000 simulations .",
    "the threshold adjustments and calculated ats are provided in table 13 .",
    "the simulation results in table 13 reveal that the adewma plan with threshold 0.984 has an in - control ats closest to the desired value of 100 when @xmath133 . on the other hand , when @xmath134 selecting a threshold of @xmath135 delivers the best plan .",
    "these results suggest that the adewma plan is robust to large changes in the size of the network from one time to the next .",
    "in many applications ( like our application in section [ sec : application ] ) , the size @xmath130 is likely to have a small variation over time .",
    "we find that in these situations the adewma plan witnesses an improvement in overall robustness .",
    "we now apply the gewma monitoring plan from ( [ eq : gewma_flag2 ] ) to investigate the dynamic relationship between republican and democratic senators in the u.s .",
    "we analyze the voting habits of each u.s .",
    "senator according to his or her vote ( yay , nay , or abstain ) on each bill that went to congress . we investigate these voting habits from 1857 ( congress 35 ) to 2015 ( congress 113 ) .",
    "we generated a dynamic network to model the co - voting patterns among u.s .",
    "senators in the following manner .",
    "we first collected the raw roll call voting data for each bill from http://voteview.com . for each congress , we generate a new network , where the senators of that congress are the nodes , and the edge weight between two senators is the number of bills for which those two senators voted concurrently in that congress .",
    "we restrict our analysis to republican and democrat senators only ( thus ignoring the independent party and other affiliations ) .",
    "predictable behavior is regarded as in - control . to model in - control behavior",
    ", we use a logistic regression model to predict whether two senators will vote the same on a newly submitted bill .",
    "we fit a logistic model to estimate the probability that a senator ( senator a ) would vote the same as another senator ( senator b ) using the following predictors : ( a ) the political affiliation of each senator ( senators a and b ) , ( b ) which party had a majority in the congress , ( c ) the proportion of that majority , and ( d ) the proportion of representation of senator a s political affiliation .",
    "the expected number of votes from senator a to senator b was calculated by multiplying the predicted probability from the logistic regression by the total number of votes for that senator .",
    "this count was assumed to be poisson distributed with in - control mean given by this expected count .    in this application",
    "we are interested in both unusually high counts and unusually low counts .",
    "therefore we run two one - sided charts .",
    "in particular , for a target team @xmath10 we analyze the @xmath48 statistic from ( [ eq : gewma ] ) , as well as the lower gewma ( @xmath136 ) statistic defined by    @xmath137    where @xmath33 was fixed to be 0.075 . the plans are trained using simulation to deliver an in - control false alarm rate of 200 .",
    "the gewma and l - gewma curves were calculated from two sources ( i ) the likelihood of republicans voting with democrats , and ( ii ) the likelihood of democrats voting with republicans .",
    "we do not expect our co - voting patterns to remain in - control and predictable ; thus , we are particularly interested in identifying sustained periods of unusual behavior .",
    "the gewma and l - gewma curves are plotted in figure [ fig : congress_application ] .",
    "these plots reveal several interesting trends in the congressional co - voting network .",
    "first , the tendency for republican and democratic senators to vote with one another has been significantly low beginning from congress 103 .",
    "this finding supports the political polarization theory observed in @xcite , who noted that the republican and democrat schism began around the time of bill clinton s first term as president ( congress 103 ) .",
    "second , there was a sustained coherence of voting between opposing political parties between congress 85 ( 1957 ) and congress 100 ( 1987 ) . during this time , the likelihood of one party concurrently voting with the other opposing party was significantly high . much of this time period coincides with the so - called `` rockefeller republican '' era ( 1960 - 1980 ) in which republican party members were known to hold particularly moderate views like the former governor of new york , nelson rockefeller @xcite .",
    "this finding was also identified using network surveillance techniques in @xcite .",
    "this paper introduces novel and computationally feasible surveillance plans for identifying communication outbreaks in dynamic networks . in the worst - case scenario when the target team is unknown , the proposed method monitors at most @xmath15 candidate teams , which dramatically improves the computational memory needed for an exhaustive search .",
    "our new plan uses a general multivariate ewma approach to accumulate temporal memory of communication counts .",
    "the approach can easily be extended to situtations with more than one communication channel .",
    "plans were extended to handle networks with heterogeneous mean counts ( as in the application ) and the value of our proposed plans was further demonstrated with simulated applications .    in our simulation study , we found that our new approach is able to effectively identify    [ fig : congress_application ]    c * democrat propensity to vote with republicans * +   +   + * republican propensity to vote with democrats * +    outbreaks even when the outbreak covers a small number of communications ( @xmath138 of total communications ) .",
    "these results suggest that the technology will be particularly useful in crime management as crime is typically committed by gangs of a small size @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we believe that law enforcement agencies would value our proposed technique as it could be used to help gain insights on persons of interest , e.g. , it could be applied juvenile crime rings as a preventative tool to help reduce repeat offenders .",
    "we found that when the outbreak is global across all communications of the targeted people , using the @xmath139 plan is the best approach and this plan is invariant of the distribution of communication counts in the target network .",
    "if the communication outbreaks involves a small sub - group of the targeted people then the group - ewma ( @xmath48 ) plan has best performance . as the size of the outbreak group",
    "is seldom known in advance , applying these plans simultaneously in a single plan may offer a more robust means to detect the full range of potential outbreaks .",
    "our proposed technique motivates several areas of future research .",
    "for example , future work should explore the potential of extending this approach to cover geographic dimensions ( see @xcite ) to account for the spatial nature of observed dynamic systems .",
    "furthermore , one can explore other ways of estimating the target team for monitoring .",
    "new approaches could involve defining people in the targeted network with either increased connectivity or historically a high connectivity .",
    "the target group itself could be regarded as varying according to whether they achieve a certain level of connectivity with the leaders , or average connectivity within the target group . in principle , one could also estimate teams of individuals that are most densely connected at time @xmath3 using a community detection or extraction algorithm on the network @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could identify candidate teams in a network with statistically significant edges using a p - value technique like that developed in @xcite .",
    "finally , this paper arbitrarily selected the temporal smoothing parameter @xmath41 . therefore future research effort could be devoted to selecting an appropriate value for the multivariate temporal smoothing .",
    "we believe that this effort should be devoted either to establishing an appropriate robust choice for @xmath33 , or to alternatively varying the choice of @xmath33 for each communication count so as to exploit local trends in the network such as the work done in @xcite .",
    "simulation methods were used to estimate the thresholds for the @xmath76 and @xmath48 plans so as to deliver an in - control ats of approximately 100 .",
    "the thresholds for both the collaborative team and the dominant leader team were established in the identical manner . to avoid redundancy",
    ", we will describe the simulation procedure to determine thresholds in the collaborative team scenario .    for the @xmath76 plan , we simulated networks of size @xmath141 .",
    "for each network , we fixed the temporal memory as @xmath142 and generated homogeneous networks with mean counts equal to @xmath143 .",
    "for each combination , the thresholds @xmath144 are estimated to obtain the fixed ats .",
    "these values were then used to build the following regression model :      once fitted , the above regression model was used to estimate the thresholds for the @xmath76 plan for homogeneous networks with mean count @xmath23 and size @xmath0 .",
    "the above fitted model delivers an in - control ats within @xmath146 for the range of @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath142 .",
    "the standard error of the model was 0.0043 and the correlation between the model fitted values and the corresponding actual simulated @xmath144 values was 0.9996 .",
    "for the @xmath48 plan , we estimated the threshold @xmath149 in a similar way as above .",
    "we generated networks of size @xmath150 , fixed @xmath151 , and simulated homogeneous networks with mean counts @xmath152 .",
    "for each combination , we estimated the threshold @xmath149 through simulation , and then used these estimates to build the following regression model :      the above model estimates the thresholds for the @xmath48 for homogeneous counts and obtained an in - control ats of @xmath154 for @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath142 .",
