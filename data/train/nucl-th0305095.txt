    "since pairing has proven to be important in atomic , nuclear , and condensed matter physics , pair truncation approximations to many body wavefunctions have been extensively studied .",

    "the second example is the interacting boson model ( ibm ) introduced by arima and iachello @xcite , where the low - lying excitations of complex even - even nuclei are described successfully by @xmath6 bosons which correspond to correlated @xmath5 nucleon pairs with angular momentum zero and @xmath7 bosons which correspond to @xmath8 nucleon pairs with angular momentum two .",
    "again , the success of the ibm in nuclear physics partly comes from the validity of the pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole force for effective interactions between valence nucleons .",

    "we shall next show that a large array of eigenvalues of four nucleons in a single-@xmath4 shell are asymptotic integers when @xmath13 and the total angular momentum , @xmath14 , is not very close to @xmath15 , and that this phenomenon originates from validity of the pair truncation scheme and special features of coupling coefficients .",

    "using this formula , one easily confirms that all matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the basis ( [ basis ] ) , @xmath89 , are zero .",

    "since @xmath43 is a negative definite operator , its eigenvalues will be negative or zero . from above",
    "we see that , for @xmath14 = 0 , there is only one state with a non - zero eigenvalue , @xmath92 .",
    "therefore one expects this eigenvalue to be the lowest in the spectrum because the eigenvalues of @xmath93 states are more or less scattered in many states , generally speaking .",
    "thus the probability that the @xmath94 is the lowest state of four fermions in a single-@xmath4 shell in the presence of random two - body interactions is expected to be larger than the probability for all other angular momentum @xmath14 , according to the empirical rule of ref .",
    "for @xmath95 there are only two exceptions , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the sum rule of diagonal matrix elements @xcite gives @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the number of @xmath3 states and here @xmath22 .",

    "thus the staggering in the number of states is expected to be reflected in the staggering of the energy which was pointed out in @xcite but without an explanation .",
    "in this paper we have shown that an attractive @xmath0-th pairing interactions favors pairs with angular momentum @xmath0 in low - lying states of fermions in a single-@xmath4 shell .",
    "therefore , one may use pairs with angular momentum @xmath0 as building blocks of wavefunctions of low - lying states .",
    "this is in contrast to repulsive pair interactions , used , for example , in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , for which the pair truncation approximation is not valid .    in addtion we discovered that the eigenvalues of states with low angular momentum @xmath14 for pair hamiltonians with @xmath0 larger than @xmath4 are approximately integers .",
    "we explain the origin of this fact for four nucleons in a single-@xmath4 shell from the validity of pair truncation and special properties of nine-@xmath4 symbols .",
    "we point out without details that the same holds for @xmath78 and @xmath77 and for @xmath80 ( @xmath103 ) .",
