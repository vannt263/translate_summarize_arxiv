    "recent work of belinschi , mai and speicher @xcite resulted in a general algorithm to calculate the distribution of any selfadjoint polynomial in free variables .",
    "since many classes of independent random matrices become asymptotically free if the size of the matrices goes to infinity , this algorithm applies then also to the calculation of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of polynomials in such independent random matrices . here",
    "we will , after first recalling the main ideas of this approach , also address the non - selfadjoint situation and present the results of work in progress of belinschi , sniady and speicher @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that the combination of the ideas from the selfadjoint case with the hermitization method allows to extend our algorithm also to the calculation of the brown measure of arbitrary polynomials in free variables .",
    "it is expected that this brown measure is then also the limiting eigenvalue distribution of corresponding random matrix problems ; however , since the convergence of @xmath0-moments does not necessarily imply the convergence of brown measures in the non - normal case , this has to remain as a conjecture for the moment .",
    "we are interested in the limiting behaviour of @xmath1 random matrices for @xmath2 .",
    "let us first recall the well - known situation of one matrix .    typical phenomena for basic random matrix ensembles",
    "are that we have almost sure convergence of the eigenvalue distribution to a deterministic limit and , furthermore , this limit distribution can be effectively calculated .",
    "the common analytic tool for calculating this limit distribution is the cauchy transform . for any probability measure @xmath3 on @xmath4",
    "we define its _ cauchy transform _",
    "@xmath5 this is an analytic function @xmath6 and we can recover @xmath3 from @xmath7 by _ stieltjes inversion formula _",
    "@xmath8 quite often , one prefers to work with @xmath9 , which is called the _",
    "stieltjes transform_.    for the basic matrix ensembles , the gaussian and the wishart random matrices , one can derive quadratic equations for the respective cauchy transforms and thus get an explicit formula for @xmath10 . in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "we show the comparision between histograms of eigenvalues and the theoretical limit result given by the cauchy transform .",
    "wigner matrix , compared to wigner s semicircle , determined by its cauchy transform @xmath11 ; right : histogram of the eigenvalues of a wishart matrix @xmath12 for a @xmath13 matrix x , compared to the marchenko - pastur distribution for @xmath14 , determined by its cauchy transform @xmath15 , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   wigner matrix , compared to wigner s semicircle , determined by its cauchy transform @xmath11 ; right : histogram of the eigenvalues of a wishart matrix @xmath12 for a @xmath13 matrix x , compared to the marchenko - pastur distribution for @xmath14 , determined by its cauchy transform @xmath15 , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]",
    "instead of one random matrix we are now interested in the case of several independent random matrices .",
    "since there is no meaningful notion of joint eigenvalue distribution of several non - commuting matrices , we are looking instead on the eigenvalue distribution of polynomials in those matrices . for the moment",
    ", we restrict to selfadjoint polynomials in selfadjoint matrices .",
    "later we will look on the non - selfadjoint case .",
    "so we are interested in the limiting eigenvalue distribution of general selfadjoint polynomials @xmath16 of several independent selfadjoint @xmath1 random matrices @xmath17 .",
    "again one observes the typical phenomena of almost sure convergence to a deterministic limit eigenvalue distribution .",
    "however , this limit distribution can be effectively calculated only in simple situations .    in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show two such typical situations .",
    "the first is the polynomial @xmath18 , for independent wigner matrix x and wishart matrix y ; in this case , one can derive quite easily the implicit equation @xmath19 for the cauchy transform @xmath10 of the limiting distribution of @xmath20 ; this subordinated form of equation is quite amenable to numerical solutions via iterations and serves as the model what we can hope for in more general situations .",
    "the second case is the polynomial @xmath21 , for which no theoretical result has existed up to now .",
    "random matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are independent gaussian and , respectively , wishart random matrices : @xmath18 ( left ) ; @xmath24 ( right ) . in the left case",
    ", the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution is relatively easy to calculate ; in the right case , no such solution was known , this case will be reconsidered in figure [ fig:3],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   random matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are independent gaussian and , respectively , wishart random matrices : @xmath18 ( left ) ; @xmath24 ( right ) . in the left case ,",
    "the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution is relatively easy to calculate ; in the right case , no such solution was known , this case will be reconsidered in figure [ fig:3],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    there existed a huge literature on special cases of such polynomials in independent matrices ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but up to @xcite there has been no algorithm for addressing the general problem .",
    "the problem of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of random matices became linked to free probability theory by the basic result of voiculescu @xcite that large classes of independent random matrices ( like wigner or wishart matrices ) become asymptoticially freely independent .",
    "the conclusion of this is : calculating the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of polynomials in such matrices is the same as calculating the distribution of polynomials in free variables .",
    "the latter is an intrinsic problem within free probability theory .",
    "we want to understand the distribution of polynomials in free variables .",
    "what we understand quite well , by the analytic theory of free convolution , is the sum of free selfadjoint variables .",
    "so we should reduce the problem of arbitrary polynomials to the problem of sums of selfadjoint variables .",
    "this sounds like a quite ambitious goal , but it can indeed be achieved",
    ". however , there is a price to pay : we have to go over to an operator - valued frame .",
    "let @xmath25 be a unital algebra and @xmath26 be a subalgebra containing the unit .",
    "a linear map @xmath27 is a _ conditional expectation _ if @xmath28=b \\qquad \\forall b\\in\\cb\\ ] ] and @xmath29=b_1e[a]b_2\\qquad \\forall a\\in\\ca,\\quad \\forall b_1,b_2\\in\\cb.\\ ] ]    an _ operator - valued probability space _ consists of @xmath26 and a conditional expectation @xmath27 .",
    "then , random variables @xmath30 ( @xmath31 are _ free with respect to @xmath32 _ ( or _ free with amalgamation over @xmath33 ) _ if @xmath34=0 $ ] whenever @xmath35 are polynomials in some @xmath36 with coefficients from @xmath33 and @xmath37=0 $ ] for all @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    for a random variable @xmath40",
    ", we define the _ operator - valued cauchy transform _ :",
    "@xmath41\\qquad ( b\\in\\cb),\\ ] ] whenever @xmath42 is invertible in @xmath33 .",
    "in order to have some nice analytic behaviour , we will in the following assume that both @xmath25 and @xmath33 are @xmath43-algebras ; @xmath33 will usually be of the form @xmath44 , the @xmath1-matrices . in such a setting and for @xmath45 , this @xmath7 is well - defined and a nice analytic map on the operator - valued upper halfplane : @xmath46 and it allows to give a nice description for the sum of two free selfadjoint elements . in the following",
    "we will use the notation @xmath47    [ thm : bms ] let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be selfadjoint operator - valued random variables free over @xmath33 .",
    "then there exists a frchet analytic map @xmath50 so that @xmath51 moreover , if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is the unique fixed point of the map @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "as we just have seen , we can deal with the sum of free selfadjoint elements , even on the operator - valued level .",
    "however , what we are interested in are polynomials in free variables , on a scalar - valued level .",
    "the relation between these two problems is given by the linearization philosophy : in order to understand polynomials @xmath56 in non - commuting variables , it suffices to understand matrices @xmath57 of linear polynomials in those variables .    in the context of free probability",
    "this idea can be traced back to the early papers of voiculescu ; it became very prominent and concrete in the seminal work @xcite of haagerup and thorbjrnsen on the largest eigenvalue of polynomials in independent gaussian random matrices . a more streamlined version of this , based on the notion of schur complement , which also has the important additional feature that it preserves selfadjointness , is due to anderson @xcite    actually , those ideas were also used before in the context of automata theory and formal languages or non - commutative rational functions , where they go under different names , like descriptor realization .",
    "some relevant literature in this context is @xcite .",
    "actually , from this context it becomes clear that we can not only linearize polynomials , but also non - commutative rational functions .",
    "the crucial point is that for any selfadjoint polynomial @xmath56 there exists a linearization @xmath57 , which is also selfadjoint . since @xmath57 is linear it is the sum of operator - valued variables .",
    "we will present the details of this procedure with the help of a concrete example .",
    "let us consider the polynomial @xmath58 in the free variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this @xmath56 has a linearization @xmath59 which means that the cauchy transform of @xmath56 can be recovered from the operator - valued cauchy transform of @xmath57 , namely we have @xmath60 but this @xmath57 can now be written as @xmath61 and hence is the sum of two selfadjoint variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which are , by basic properties of freeness , free over @xmath64 .",
    "so we can use our subordination result in order to calculate the cauchy transform of @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath65 where we calculate @xmath53 via iterations as in theorem [ thm : bms ] .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the agreement between the achieved theoretic result and the histogram of eigenvalues from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "( left ) for free @xmath66 , where @xmath48 is semicircular and @xmath49 marchenko - pastur , and of the rational function @xmath67 ( right ) for free semicircular elements @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; in both cases our theoretical limit curve is compared with the histogram of the corresponding eigenvalue problem ; for the left case compare figure [ fig:2],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   ( left ) for free @xmath66 , where @xmath48 is semicircular and @xmath49 marchenko - pastur , and of the rational function @xmath67 ( right ) for free semicircular elements @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; in both cases our theoretical limit curve is compared with the histogram of the corresponding eigenvalue problem ; for the left case compare figure [ fig:2],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    conclusion : the combination of linearization and operator - valued subordination allows to deal with case of selfadjoint polynomials in free variables , and thus with selfadjoint polynomials in asymptotically free random matrices .",
    "as we mentioned before this linearization procedure works as well in the case of non - commutative rational functions ( and this was actually the main object of interest in the work of schtzenberger ) .",
    "this is work in progress with mai , let us here just give an example for this .",
    "consider the following selfadjoint rational function @xmath70 in two free variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the fact that we can write it as @xmath71 gives us immediately a selfadjoint linearization of the form @xmath72    in figure [ fig:3 ] , we compare the histogram of eigenvalues of @xmath73 for one realization of independent gaussian random matrices @xmath74 of size @xmath75 with the distribution of @xmath67 for free semicircular elements @xmath76 , calculated according to our algorithm .",
    "the main point of this note is that we can actually also extend the previous method to deal with not necessarily self - adjoint polynomials in free variables .",
    "the first problem in this situation is that we need to describe a measure on the complex plane by some analytic object .",
    "let us first have a look on this .    for a measure @xmath3 on @xmath77 its cauchy transform",
    "@xmath78 is well - defined everywhere outside a set of @xmath79-lebesgue measure zero , however , it is analytic only outside the support of @xmath3 .",
    "the measure @xmath3 can be extracted from its cauchy transform by the formula ( understood in distributional sense ) @xmath80 a better approach to this is by regularization : @xmath81 is well  defined for every @xmath82 . by sub - harmonicity arguments    @xmath83    is a probability measure on the complex plane and one has the weak convergence @xmath84 .",
    "our general polynomial in free variables will in general not be selfadjoint nor normal .",
    "thus we need a generalization of the distribution of a selfadjoint operator to a non - normal situation .",
    "this can be done , in a tracial setting , by imitating essentially the ideas from above .",
    "so let us consider a general ( not necessarily normal ) operator @xmath48 in a tracial non - commutative probability space @xmath85 .",
    "( we need some nice analytic frame here , so @xmath25 should be a von neumann algebra . )",
    "we put @xmath86 then @xmath87 is a probability measure on the complex plane , which converges weakly for @xmath88 .",
    "this limit @xmath89 is called the _ brown measure _ of @xmath48 ; it was introduced by l. brown in 1986 and revived in 2000 by haagerup and larsen @xcite , who made decisive use of it for their investigations around the invariant subspace problem .",
    "the idea of the hermitization method is to treat non - normal operators ( or random matrices ) @xmath48 by studying sufficiently many selfadjoint @xmath90 matrices built out of @xmath48 .",
    "a contact of this idea with the world of free probabilty was made on a formal level in the works of janik , nowak , papp , zahed @xcite and of feinberg , zee @xcite .",
    "we show in @xcite that operator - valued free probability is the right frame to deal with this rigorously . by combining this with our subordination formulation of operator - valued free convolution we can then calculate the brown measure of any polynomial in free variables .    in order to get the brown measure of @xmath48 , we need @xmath91 let @xmath92 note that @xmath22 is selfadjoint .",
    "consider @xmath22 in the @xmath93-valued probability space with repect to @xmath94 given by @xmath95 = \\begin{pmatrix } \\ff(a_{11 } ) & \\ff(a_{12 } ) \\\\",
    "\\ff(a_{21 } ) & \\ff(a_{22 } ) \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] for the argument @xmath96 consider now the @xmath93-valued cauchy transform of @xmath22 @xmath97   = \\begin{pmatrix } g_{\\epsilon,\\lambda,11 } & g_{\\epsilon,\\lambda,12 } \\\\",
    "g_{\\epsilon,\\lambda,21 } & g_{\\epsilon,\\lambda,22 } \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] one can easily check that @xmath98 is actually given by @xmath99 and thus we are again in the situation that our quantity of interest is actually one entry of an operator - valued cauchy transform : @xmath100",
    "so in order to calculate the brown measure of some polynomial @xmath56 we should first hermitize the problem by going over to selfadjoint @xmath90 matrices over our underlying space , then we should linearize the problem on this level and use finally our subordination description of operator - valued free convolution to deal with this linear problem .",
    "it might be not so clear whether hermitization and linearisation go together well , but this is indeed the case .",
    "essentially we do here a linearization of an operator - valued model instead of a scalar - valued one : we have to linearize a polynomial in matrices .",
    "but the linearization algorithm works in this case as well .          in order to linearize this",
    "we should first write it as a polynomial in matrices of @xmath48 and matrices of @xmath49 .",
    "this can be achieved as follows : @xmath104 @xmath105 is now a selfadjoint polynomial in the selfadjoint variables @xmath106 and has thus a selfadjoint linearization @xmath107 pluggin in back the @xmath90 matrices for @xmath22 and @xmath23 we get finally the selfadjoint linearization of @xmath108 as @xmath109 which can be written as the sum of two @xmath110-free matrices : @xmath111 for calculating the cauchy transform of this sum we can then use again our subordination algorithm for the operator - valued free convolution from theorem [ thm : bms ] . putting all the steps together gives an algorithm for calculating the brown measure of @xmath56 .",
    "of course , we expect that in nice cases the eigenvalue distribution of our polynomial evaluated in independent wigner or wishart matrices should converge to the brown measure of the polynomial in the corresponding free variables .",
    "however , in contrast to the selfadjoint case this is not automatic from the convergence of all relevant moments and one has to control probabilities of small eigenvalues during all the calculations .",
    "such control have been achieved in special cases ( in particular , the circular law and the single ring theorem ) , but in general it has to remain open for the moment .    in the following figures we give for some polynomials the brown measure according to our algorithm and compare this with histograms of the complex eigenvalues of the corresponding polynomials in independent random matrices .",
    "as before , this algorithm can also be extended to rational functions in our variables .",
    "an example for the outcome of our algorithm in the case of the non - selfadjoint rational function given by @xmath112 is shown in figure [ fig:7 ] .",
