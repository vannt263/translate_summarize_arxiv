    "boosted by the discovery of superconductivity in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  over twenty years ago,@xcite the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism has been extensively investigated in various d and f heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds .",
    "a consensus has developed that hf superconductivity is mediated by spin fluctuations,@xcite mainly because superconductivity was found close to a magnetic instability at @xmath5 , sometimes described as a quantum - critical point ( qcp ) , often attained by applying pressure .",
    "a recent development is that an essentially gapless superconducting ( sc ) state has been identified by nmr / nqr measurements in the region where the sc state coexists with antiferromagnetism,@xcite consistent with a theoretical prediction.@xcite in this paper we further explore the possibility that at a pressure @xmath6gpa , a second qcp , associated with f - electron occupation number , has a major role to play in the superconductivity of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  and related compounds.@xcite cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  has a superconducting ground state at ambient pressure with a critical temperature @xmath7 , around 0.7  k. it is firmly believed that the compound is close to an antiferromagnetic qcp at slight negative pressure , accessible for example by partial substitution of si with ge.@xcite when pressure is applied , @xmath7 initially remains close to its ambient pressure value , followed by a sudden increase to around @xmath8k at about @xmath9gpa .",
    "further increase in pressure results in a slower suppression of @xmath7 to zero .",
    "this non - monotonous behavior of @xmath10 was first explored by resistivity in the quasi - hydrostatic conditions of bridgman anvil cell.@xcite subsequent investigations by susceptibility@xcite and resistivity @xcite were carried out in various pressure media , and showed considerable variation in @xmath7 between samples , especially at high pressure . with increasing pressure cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  passes from a nearly trivalent @xmath11 behavior , with kondo coupling between conduction and f - electrons , to behavior at very high pressure characteristic of intermediate valence ( iv ) systems , whose valence fluctuates between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 $ ] electronic configurations . as a result ,",
    "deep in this iv regime , the resistivity , for instance , resembles that of lacu@xmath0si@xmath0 , which lacks @xmath14 electrons",
    ". similar @xmath10 dependence to that found in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  is seen in the isoelectronic sister compound , cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 , offset by about 10@xmath15gpa due to the larger atomic volume of ge.@xcite apart from this shift of the pressure scale , no qualitative difference occurs between the two compounds beyond unavoidable sample dependence .    from a more theoretical point of view , there exist at least three reasons to believe that critical valence fluctuations are at the origin of the pressure - induced peak of the sc transition temperature @xmath7 .",
    "first , the @xmath16 coefficient of the @xmath17 resistivity law decreases drastically by about two orders of magnitude around the pressure corresponding to the @xmath7 peak.@xcite since @xmath16 scales as @xmath18 in the so - called kondo regime , this implies that the effective mass @xmath19 of the quasiparticles also decreases sharply there .",
    "this fall of @xmath19 is possible only if there is a sharp change of ce valence , deviating from ce@xmath20 , since the following approximate formula for the renormalization factor @xmath21 holds in the strongly correlated limit:@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the f - electron number per ce ion .",
    "second , the so - called kadowaki - woods ( kw ) ratio,@xcite @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the sommerfeld coefficient of the electronic specific heat , crosses over quickly from that of a strongly correlated class to a weakly correlated one.@xcite the inverse of the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath26 , can be identified with the kondo temperature @xmath27 , which is experimentally accessible by resistivity measurements .",
    "this indicates that the mass enhancement due to the dynamical electron correlation is quickly lost at around @xmath28 , in agreement with the previous point .",
    "the phenomenon can be understood if we note the fact that @xmath25 consists essentially of two terms : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is due to the so - called band effect and @xmath31 is due to the many - body correlation effect , with @xmath32 being the self - energy of the correlated electrons .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath16 are related to each other through the kramers - krnig relation , leading to the large value of the kw ratio,@xcite and when @xmath34 , this is indeed seen . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath35 , the ratio @xmath24 should be reduced from the kw value considerably because the effect of @xmath30 can not be neglected in its denominator .",
    "third , there is a sharp peak in the residual resistivity @xmath36 at around @xmath37,@xcite which can be understood as a many - body effect enhancing the impurity potential ( in fact we define the pressure @xmath4 experimentally by the maximum of @xmath38 ) .",
    "in the forward scattering limit , this enhancement is proportional to the valence susceptibility @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the atomic f - level of the ce ion , and @xmath41 is the chemical potential.@xcite physically speaking , local valence change coupled to the impurity or disorder gives rise to a change of valence in a wide region around the impurity which then scatters the quasiparticles quite strongly , leading to the increase of @xmath36 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath36 can be thus directly related to the degree of sharpness of the valence change , because the variation of the atomic level @xmath40 is considered to be a smooth function of the pressure .",
    "these circumstantial clues to the importance of critical valence fluctuations have been backed up by a microscopic calculation of @xmath7 for @xmath42-wave pairing as a function of @xmath43.@xcite this showed that sudden valence change occurs if a moderately sized coulomb repulsion @xmath44 is taken into account between the conduction c- , and localized f - electrons , with the peak structure of @xmath7 being qualitatively reproduced .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : properties ] summarizes the current experimental evidence of anomalies seen in cecu@xmath0(ge / si)@xmath0 around @xmath45 .",
    "part * ( i ) * of table [ tab : properties ] refers to direct evidence for a valence transition of the ce ion : cell volume@xcite and @xmath46 x - ray absorption@xcite measurements show discontinuities as a function of pressure .",
    "the drastic decrease of the @xmath16 coefficient of the @xmath47 resistivity law , along with the @xmath16 vs @xmath48 scaling relation , indicate that the system is leaving the strongly correlated regime characterized by a f - occupation number close to unity .",
    "( @xmath48 is defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmax ] and assumed to be proportional to @xmath27 . )",
    "part * ( ii ) * refers to anomalies observed close to the maximum of @xmath7 predicted by critical valence fluctuation theory.@xcite these are the maximum of @xmath7 itself and the enhanced residual resistivity , @xmath38.@xcite part * ( iii ) * refers to properties following from the extended treatment of the critical valence fluctuations found in section [ sec : theory ] of this paper .",
    "this includes the linear resistivity,@xcite and the maximum in @xmath25 , both found around @xmath4 . in part * ( iv ) * are listed the remaining features that are observed in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  and cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0  around the maximum in @xmath7 but which are so far not fully explained .",
    "for example the merging of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where the latter ( also defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmax ] ) is believed to reflect the effect of the excited crystalline electric field ( cef ) split f - levels .",
    "many of the anomalies noted in table [ tab : properties ] have also been observed to coincide with the maximum of @xmath7 in other hf superconductors , from cepd@xmath0si@xmath0@xcite to cecu@xmath50au@xcite , the latter showing traces of superconductivity under pressure .",
    "previous work on cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  has shown a lot of variation in low - temperature behavior between different samples .",
    "the fact that not all reports have shown every anomaly is not entirely surprising , since large variations in the electronic properties of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  are well known to result from extremely small differences in composition.@xcite the extension of these variations with pressure has not been systematically explored , but almost all samples so far studied have shown an enhancement of @xmath7 , along with effects such as the enhancement of the residual resistivity , to be discussed below .",
    "this variability under pressure may be due to the samples themselves , or to pressure inhomogeneities caused by non - hydrostatic pressure media .",
    "we were therefore motivated to use solid helium as a pressure medium , due to its near - ideal hydrostaticity at low temperature .",
    "by simultaneously probing resistivity and specific heat in the same sample , we were able to explore both percolative transport and bulk evidence for superconductivity .",
    "high pressure was induced using diamond anvils with a 1.5@xmath15 mm culet.@xcite a stainless steel gasket was specially prepared to absorb the large volume decrease of the helium pressure medium from ambient pressure , and to avoid severing the measurement wires .",
    "these were insulated from the gasket using a mixture of al@xmath0o@xmath51 powder and epoxy resin .",
    "the pressure was measured to within 0.02@xmath15gpa at various temperatures down to 4.2@xmath15k using the ruby fluorescence scale .",
    "the cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  sample was prepared by reaction of its constituent elements with a slight excess of cu , with a nominal initial composition cecu@xmath52si@xmath0 . the product",
    "was then melted in an induction furnace and slowly allowed to crystallize under 50 bars ar in a bazro@xmath51 crucible ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "the small monocrystal used in this work was cut and polished to @xmath53m@xmath54 , and six 5@xmath55 m @xmath56 wires ( four gold and two au + 0.07% at .",
    "fe ) were spot welded to the sample .",
    "the @xmath57-axis of the tetragonal structure was parallel to its smallest dimension .",
    "the magnetic field , when applied , was parallel to the @xmath57-axis .",
    "the six wires spot - welded to the sample allowed multiple redundant measurements to be performed . this improved reliability and enabled us to verify the calorimetry measurements using several different configurations .",
    "the sample resistance could be measured by a four - point method ; a knowledge of the sample dimensions then enabled the absolute resistivity to be determined to within 10% .",
    "the two thermocouple junctions were formed from an au / fe pair at either end of the sample .",
    "an alternating resistive heating current was passed through one ( to avoid passing the current through the sample ) , while the signal from the other was measured using a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the resulting temperature oscillations serve as a sensitive measure of the sample heat capacity.@xcite a simple model of the a.c .- calorimetry system predicts the amplitude and phase of the temperature oscillations ( @xmath58 ) induced by a.c .",
    "heating : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the heating power , @xmath61 the thermal conductance to the bath , @xmath62 the heat capacity , and @xmath63 the excitation frequency , assumed to be low enough that the thermometer can follow the temperature oscillations ( the factor of @xmath64 may be assumed implicitly from this point ) .",
    "the signal therefore contains a contribution from the specific heat and from thermal coupling to the surroundings . for frequencies @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the cut - off frequency @xmath67 , the sample contribution dominates the signal , and @xmath68 can be considered to be inversely proportional to the heat capacity ( which we assume to be dominated by the sample ) . for @xmath69 , the signal approaches the d.c .",
    "limit and gives a measure of the mean elevation of the sample temperature over that of the bath . for intermediate measuring frequencies , information from the phase @xmath70 , can be used to extract the specific heat : @xmath71 alternatively , one can subtract a background signal taken at a different frequency , with @xmath72 where ideally @xmath73 .",
    "the sample temperature must also be corrected for the constant d.c .",
    "component of the oscillatory joule heating .",
    "this was done by repeating the measurement well below the cut - off frequency , also providing the background signal in order to estimate @xmath74 using eq.@xmath15([eq : tdc ] ) .",
    "the cut - off frequency @xmath66 turned out to be very temperature dependent , varying between 200@xmath15hz at 0.5@xmath15k and over 2@xmath15khz at 1.5@xmath15k , presumably due to the thermal properties of the surrounding material .",
    "fortunately , while complicating the data analysis , the reduction in @xmath66 at the lowest temperatures allows the technique to be used down to @xmath75100@xmath15 mk .",
    "the two estimates of @xmath74 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) and ( [ eq : tdc ] ) are in good agreement below @xmath752@xmath15k .",
    "the working frequency @xmath76 was generally of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "sources of systematic error in the result might come from : variation of the fe thermopower under pressure ; temperature and/or frequency dependent addenda to the measured specific heat due to the pressure medium , gasket and/or anvils ; or any irreversibility or first - order character in the transitions being observed .",
    "these potential problems will be addressed in the discussion .",
    "we present five principal results from the sample reported in this paper , and by drawing on previous work , we aim to place our work in a broader context .",
    "we will try to highlight common features found in many samples of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , one of the defining characteristics of which is its variability .",
    "* we present the superconducting phase diagram obtained using various criteria for @xmath7 , and compare it to the widely quoted phase diagram determined under hydrostatic conditions by susceptibility . *",
    "we examine the details of the superconducting transition , which provides some insight into the nature of the sc state and into the sample itself .",
    "* we estimate the variation of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath25 , with pressure , and compare it to previous results obtained by analysis of the upper critical field . *",
    "we report the pressure dependence of the residual resistivity @xmath38 , and exponent @xmath77 , determined by a fit to the normal state resistivity of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 denoting a free exponent as opposed to the quadratic coefficient @xmath16 ) .",
    "a comparison of @xmath80 between different samples reveals a scaling relation which can be related to the theoretical enhancement of impurity scattering .",
    "* we explore the deviation from the scaling relation @xmath81 , which indicates the sharp change in f - electron occupation number described in the introduction .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath7 and the other results described above are shown to occur around the same pressure .",
    "@xmath10 in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 determined from resistivity and specific heat measurements .",

    "the temperature @xmath87 , at which the resistance vanishes , behaves differently from @xmath88 .",
    "it has a narrower peak with a maximum at slightly higher pressure .",
    "@xmath83 agrees closely however with the transition seen in the specific heat ( see below ) . when a magnetic field was applied , @xmath83 and the specific heat anomaly shifted in agreement .",
    "the large resistive transition widths found in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  at high pressure are often blamed on a lack of hydrostaticity due to the pressure medium . as helium was used in this case , we can rule out pressure inhomogeneities and concentrate on the sample itself .",
    "further information about the sc state comes from the effect of measurement current on the transition width .",
    "for example , at 1.78@xmath15gpa high current led to the upper part of the transition disappearing , and a resistive transition can even be recovered with a narrow width comparable to that close to ambient pressure .",
    "this is presumably due to the presence of filamentary superconductivity , with a higher @xmath7 , whose critical current density is exceeded .",
    "these broad resistive transitions appear to be a universal feature of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  at high pressure .",
    "let us recall that even for the highest @xmath89 measured in a single crystal , at 2.4@xmath15k , a tail of 1% of the normal state resistivity remained well below 2@xmath15k , vanishing only at 1.5@xmath15k.@xcite the status of the superconductivity of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  between @xmath90 and @xmath83 remains mysterious .",

    "figure  [ fig : cp ] compares the superconducting transition in resistivity and specific heat at three different pressures . at 2.38@xmath15gpa",
    "the resistive transition is broad and the sharp specific heat jump at 0.73@xmath15k begins at the point where the resistance falls to zero . at 3.67@xmath15gpa the specific heat jump , at 1.35@xmath15k ,",
    "is much larger , and remains sharp ( and did so at intervening pressures ) , while the corresponding resistive transition has narrowed considerably . at 4.07@xmath15gpa ( not shown ) where @xmath83 has a maximum around 1.6@xmath15k in both @xmath91 and @xmath74 , the specific heat peak has already started to broaden and collapse in amplitude , while at the same pressure the resistive transition is at its narrowest since ambient pressure . as @xmath7 is driven to zero at high pressure , the superconducting @xmath74 jump becomes smaller and broader ( as shown at 4.67@xmath15gpa ) until it is no longer visible .",
    "when the pressure was reduced , the @xmath74 peak recovered its shape , indicating the reversibility of the bulk pressure - induced behavior .",
    "the dramatic increase in the apparent size of the superconducting jump is intriguing , and might suggest the presence of strong coupling,@xcite or other qualitative change in the sc state .",
    "although the apparent value of @xmath92 is clearly less than the bcs ratio of 1.43 , similar a.c .",
    "measurements on cecoin@xmath50 in an argon pressure medium indicate that there is a substantial contribution to the measured heat capacity from addenda.@xcite in helium we would expect this to be even more significant    the increase in the @xmath74 jump size might itself be an artefact of the uncalibrated a.c .- calorimetry method ; nevertheless @xmath93 does appear to show a maximum at a pressure coinciding with the increase in @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of strong coupling provided the best fit to @xmath94 for measurements of the upper critical field in another sample.@xcite    estimate @xmath95 of the sommerfeld coefficient from a.c .- calorimetry signal at 2@xmath15k ( triangles ) , scaled for comparison with that deduced from @xmath94 measurements ( squares).@xcite the lines are guides for the eye . ]    the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath25 , and hence the effective mass @xmath96 , can be estimated by following the calorimetric signal @xmath97 , at a fixed temperature and measurement frequency above the superconducting transition , though this includes constant or slowly varying addenda from the helium , diamonds etc .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma ] shows the estimate @xmath95 , along with the value deduced from measurements of the upper critical field in ref .  .",
    "a single constant scale factor has been introduced , showing that the two curves can be superimposed .",
    "there is a clear anomaly in @xmath98 at 4@xmath15gpa ( just below the pressure corresponding to @xmath99 ) , superimposed on a constant reduction with pressure .",

    "the magnitude of this peak varies by a factor of more than ten between samples.@xcite however , it is possible to scale the residual resistivities from different samples onto the same lorentzian curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho0 ] ) .",
    "a constant value @xmath102 , different for each sample , is subtracted from @xmath38 at each pressure , and the result is multiplied by a scale factor , @xmath101 ( i.e. @xmath103 ) , so that all lie on the curve defined by sample s1 , which has the highest residual resistivity ( i.e. @xmath104 ) . according to the theoretical prediction , the residual resistivity @xmath36 is given as @xcite @xmath105 where the coefficient @xmath106 depends on the band structure of host metals , @xmath107 is the concentration of impurities with moderate scattering potential @xmath108 coming from disorder other than ce ions , @xmath109 is the density of states of quasiparticles around the fermi level , and the last term represents the residual resistivity due to unitary scattering mainly arising from any deficit or defect of the ce ions .",

    "secondly , the exponent appears surprisingly large ( @xmath114 ) at the slightly higher pressure corresponding to the maximum @xmath38 .",
    "this is difficult to understand without taking into account the resistivity due to impurity scattering . in sample s1 ,",
    "reported in ref .  , the residual resistivity reaches @xmath115 cm at @xmath4 , compared to a maximum of @xmath116 cm for the sample reported here .",
    "@xmath113 then showed a falloff with temperature very similar to that of a kondo impurity system .",
    "in other samples , this behavior is hidden by the usual positive temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "contrary to the usual situation , where the lowest @xmath38 possible is sought , this example shows how samples whose residual resistivities are large at ambient pressure can reveal interesting physics at high pressure .",

    "these are effective in a wide region in the brillouin zone due to their local nature and easily couple to the umklapp process of quasiparticle scattering .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental fact that @xmath3-linear resistivity is observed in a narrow pressure region around @xmath4 , which is considered to correspond to a nearly critical valence transition of the ce ion .",
    "such a @xmath3-linear dependence has been discussed in the context of high-@xmath7 cuprates with a marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) assumption,@xcite and charge transfer fluctuations were once considered as an origin for mfl,@xcite while further theoretical models have been put forth up to now.@xcite excepting the @xmath3-linear resistivity , the present result is different from mfl behavior .",

    ", it is to be noted that @xmath3-linear resistivity is accompanied by the peak of @xmath7 in both systems , high-@xmath7 cuprates and cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the result ( [ chiv7a ] ) implies that the mass enhancement @xmath180 is expected around @xmath131 .",
    "namely , the effective mass is given by @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the effective mass renormalized by the conventional correlation effect , leading to heavy electrons , i.e. not including the effect of critical valence fluctuations .",
    "this latter effective mass @xmath182 exhibits a drastic decrease around @xmath28 , while the second factor in ( [ chiv8 ] ) is enhanced .",
    "both effects should be reflected in the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath25 , so that the peak of @xmath183 is shifted to the lower pressure ( larger @xmath184 ) side , and the anomaly of @xmath25 due to the valence fluctuations may be smeared to some extent . nevertheless , some trace should be observed .",
    "( the shift of peak of @xmath25 can be understood as the superposition of the two trends using a model @xmath185-dependence of @xmath182 and @xmath138 . )",
    "indeed , the present experimental result presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] and  [ fig : tmax ] may be explained by this effect .",
    "our calorimetric results in such extreme conditions deserve some discussion , in particular the considerable apparent increase in the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition when @xmath4 is approached",
    ". a very large specific heat jump at @xmath7 would be strongly reminiscent of the huge value found in cecoin@xmath50.@xcite it is therefore a legitimate question to ask how much the results of the uncalibrated ac calorimetry technique under pressure can be relied on to give an accurate measurement of the specific heat .",
    "the model used to extract the specific heat from the amplitude and phase of the temperature oscillations takes no account of the heat capacity of the solid helium , diamonds , or surrounding pressure apparatus , or the essentially three - dimensional nature of the situation .",
    "secondly , the thermopower of the fe thermocouple has been assumed not to vary with pressure ( ref .",
    "indicates that it varies by no more than 20% up to 12 gpa ) .",
    "nevertheless , the superconducting transition observed corresponds to @xmath186 of the signal amplitude , indicating that the addenda are a minority contribution to the total signal . runs at several different frequencies agree to within 1020% after the amplitude and phase are combined , with the discrepancy possibly due to frequency - dependent addenda .",
    "kapitza resistance between the sample and helium is likely to better decouple the sample from its surroundings at very low temperature . if the specific heat is calculated using the two - frequency method [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdc ] ) ] , the result agrees ( @xmath187 ) with that calculated using the amplitude and phase up to at least @xmath188 . given these observations",
    ", it seems reasonable to accept our results as a good first approximation to @xmath74 , to within a constant scaling factor , and with an unknown but relatively small component due to addenda .",
    "furthermore , the apparent anomaly in the normal state specific heat shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] was measured at a fixed temperature and frequency above the superconducting transition , with pressure the only independent variable .",
    "the small peak in @xmath25 is consistent with the maximum in the initial slope of the upper critical field observed at the same pressure , though the interpretation of the latter depends on whether the sample can be considered to be in the clean or dirty limit , or somewhere in between .",
    "having addressed the experimental questions , let us discuss some other remaining points .",
    "the merging of @xmath189 and @xmath190 seems to be be a general feature at @xmath4 in compounds where a critical valence transition is thought to exist .",
    "it can be understood as follows :    the so - called kondo temperature @xmath191 , related to @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) , depends crucially on the degeneracy @xmath194 of the local f - state : @xmath195 $ ] , where @xmath196 is the bandwidth of conduction electrons , @xmath197 the density of states of conduction electrons at the fermi level , and @xmath198 the c - f exchange coupling constant.@xcite even though the 6-fold degeneracy of the 4f - state is lifted by the cef effect , leaving the kramers doublet ground state and excited cef levels with excitation energy @xmath124 , the kondo temperature @xmath191 is still enhanced considerably by the effect of the excited cef levels.@xcite the technical degeneracy relevant to the kondo effect is affected by the broadening @xmath199 of the lowest cef level . if @xmath200 , the degeneracy relevant to @xmath191 is 2-fold . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath201 , it increases to 4- or 6-fold .",
    "the level broadening is given by @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the strength of c - f hybridization , and @xmath204 is the renormalization factor which gives the inverse of mass enhancement in the case of a lattice system .",
    "it is crucial that @xmath199 is very sensitive to the valence of ce ion because @xmath204 is essentially given by @xmath21 [ eq.([eq : m*nf ] ) ] .",
    "in particular , the factor @xmath204 increases from a tiny value in the kondo regime , @xmath205 , and approaches unity in the so - called valence fluctuation regime . since the factor @xmath206 in general for ce - based heavy electron systems , the ratio @xmath207 , which is much smaller than 1 in the kondo regime , greatly exceeds 1 across the valence transformation around @xmath28 , leading to the increase of the technical degeneracy of f - state , _ irrespective _ of the sharpness of the valence transformation .",
    "therefore , @xmath189 should merge with @xmath190 , which corresponds to 4- or 6-fold degeneracy of 4f - state due to the effect of finite temperature , i.e. , @xmath208 .",
    "this may be the reason why @xmath189 increases and approaches @xmath190 at pressure where @xmath7 exhibits the maximum , and the kw ratio changes between strongly and weakly correlated classes .",
    "while the experimental picture of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  presented in this paper is more complete than the theoretical , a large number of the features found around @xmath4 follow directly from the valence fluctuation approach and the addition of a @xmath44 term to the hamiltonian .",
    "the linear resistivity is explained in section [ sec : theory ] , as is the local maximum in the electronic specific heat , possibly due to the renormalisation of the effective mass due to valence fluctuations , superimposed on an overall decrease with pressure .",
    "the enhancement of the residual resistivity at low temperature follows from the renormalisation of impurity potentials by valence fluctuations .",
    "the relative positions of the peaks in @xmath7 , @xmath25 , and @xmath38 are consistent with the valence fluctuation scenario , but for a more precise comparison more detailed calculation would be needed .",
    "other features yet to be fully addressed with the current model are observed to occur in the valence fluctuation region .",
    "they are the apparent increase in the specific heat jump at @xmath7 , the temperature dependence of the impurity contribution to the resistivity , and the nature of the superconducting state between the onset and completion of the superconducting transition .",
    "the presence , and indeed enhancement , of superconductivity so far from the disappearance of magnetic order calls into question whether magnetic mediation is really the sole mechanism of superconductivity in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the evidence presented here , along with other anomalous behavior seen at a pressure well separated from the disappearance of magnetism , strongly suggests the presence of a second quantum critical point in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , this time related to quantum fluctuations between electronic configurations rather than to collective spin instabilities .",
    "while magnetic pairing may be responsible for superconductivity at the magnetic qcp , critical valence fluctuations are responsible for pairing at @xmath4 .",
    "the recent result in cecu@xmath0(si@xmath209ge@xmath210)@xmath0,@xcite where two separate peaks of @xmath7 are observed , suggests the validity of the present point of view .",
    "schematic @xmath185-@xmath3 phase diagram for cecu@xmath0(si / ge)@xmath0 showing the two critical pressures @xmath211 and @xmath4 . at @xmath211 , where the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath212 , superconductivity in region @xmath213 is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ; around @xmath4 , in the region @xmath214 , valence fluctuations provide the pairing mechanism and the resistivity is linear in temperature .",
    "the temperatures @xmath48 , and @xmath48 , merge at a pressure coinciding with @xmath4 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : schemphadiag ] shows a schematic phase diagram for the cecu@xmath0(si / ge)@xmath0 system .",
    "the two critical pressures , @xmath211 and @xmath4 , are respectively defined by the disappearance of magnetic order as @xmath215 tends to zero , and by the region of linear resistivity where @xmath38 has a maximum and @xmath216 , accompanied by a maximum in @xmath7 . in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  and cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0  the two critical pressures are widely separated . in compounds such as cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 on the other hand , superconductivity is found in a narrow pocket , seemingly directly connected to the disappearance of magnetism as @xmath212 .",
    "however , many of the other anomalies listed in table [ tab : properties ] are still observed in this system , and are difficult to explain within a purely spin fluctuation picture .",
    "if a valence instability is present in cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 , @xmath4 is superimposed on @xmath211 , as identified by the pressure at which @xmath216.@xcite the physics associated with valence change in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  may thus also play an important role in other heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "linear resistivity and an enhancement of @xmath38 have also been seen in the cetin@xmath50 compounds,@xcite where t is co , rh or ir . for this family",
    ", superconductivity extends over a relatively broad pressure range , and it may be that valence fluctuations also play a role with a critical valence pressure separate from any magnetic instability . finally , it is worth addressing the physical interpretation of the valence fluctuation mediated pairing interaction .",
    "we emphasize that this intuitive explanation is rather speculative , but we think that it is sufficiently useful to merit inclusion .",
    "a clue comes from the likely nearest neighbor pairing , implied by the largely local nature of the interaction , and the prediction of @xmath42-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "one can imagine an almost filled f - band , with each occupied @xmath217 site experiencing a coulomb repulsion @xmath44 from the respective conduction electrons .",
    "as the pressure is increased and @xmath40 moves closer to the fermi level @xmath218 , there will come a point where @xmath219 and the f - band will start to empty . on an individual @xmath220",
    "` hole ' site , the @xmath44 interaction will be absent , thus an increased density of conduction electrons would be energetically favorable at this position .",
    "if this extra ` screening ' conduction electron density is not strictly localized onto the atom itself , but spills onto neighboring sites , the f - electrons on ce atoms around the original ` hole ' site will feel an increased repulsion .",
    "the tendency to transfer electrons from the f to conduction bands will be locally reinforced , explaining intuitively the increasingly catastrophic drop in @xmath23 for larger @xmath221 , predicted in ref .  .",
    "for large enough @xmath44 , phase separation would be expected to occur for some values of @xmath40 .",
    "the attractive pairing interaction can be understood as follows : consider an isolated pair of @xmath220 ` holes ' , accompanied by their cloud of conduction electrons .",
    "if these are separated by two lattice positions , with an intervening filled @xmath125 site , the two clouds of conduction electrons will overlap at the intermediate site , further increasing the coulomb energy at that point .",
    "it would therefore be energetically favorable for the two ` holes ' to be on neighboring atoms , thus the attractive interaction .",
    "the attractive interaction between ` holes ' is equivalent to that between ` electrons ' , so that this argument would give an intuitive understanding of the origin of the valence - fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "the enhancement of superconductivity in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  under pressure is found to coincide with a number of anomalies in the superconducting and normal state properties that are hard to explain in a purely spin fluctuation scenario .",
    "many of these anomalies are directly related to an abrupt change in valence of the ce ion , while others can be indirectly connected to such a transition .",
    "we propose a second critical pressure @xmath4 at around 4.5@xmath15gpa where critical valence fluctuations provide the superconducting pairing mechanism . an extended anderson lattice model with coulomb repulsion between the conduction and f - electrons",
    "predicts an abrupt change in ce f - level occupation .",
