    "the research of many natural and social phenomena shows that the future development of many processes depends not only on their present state but also essentially on their previous history .",
    "such processes can be described by stochastic differential delayed equations ( sddes ) .",
    "many examples , such as population dynamics models in biology and memory or inertia representation models in finance , can be found in kolmanovskii and shaikhet @xcite , mohammed @xcite .",
    "stochastic optimal control problems with time delay are those whose dynamics of states are described by sddes , and to find some optimal control to maximize / minimize the corresponding cost functionals . in general , stochastic optimal control problems with time delay are practically intractable , because of their infinite - dimensional nature .",
    "however , in certain cases which are still very interesting for the applications , stochastic optimal control problems with time delay can be reduced to a finite - dimensional one and solved explicitly . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first example of such a solvable problem is a linear delayed system with a quadratic cost functional , given by kolmanovskii and maizenberg @xcite , where only the pointwise and distributed time delays are involved in the state variable ( see ( [ definition of delay terms ] ) in this section ) . then elsanosi et al . @xcite",

    "dynamic programming principle for optimal control problems of systems described by sddes was obtained by larssen @xcite when both the dynamics and the cost depends on the past in a general way . as applications , systems where the value function depends on the past only through some weighted average were studied .",
    "the finite dimensional hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation for the value function of such problems was derived by larssen and risebro @xcite , and the solvability of it was guaranteed by a particular system of first order partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",

    "sufficient and necessary maximum principles for optimal control under partial information were obtained .",
    "an optimal consumption problem with respect to recursive utility from a cash flow with delay was discussed . however , since in their paper the adjoint backward equation was described as an anticipated or time - advanced bsde ( absde ) of peng and yang @xcite s type , no explicit solution was given ( note that a solvable special case was given only when trivially there was no time delay in @xcite ) .",

    "one main difficulty and obstacle is that the solution to a stochastic optimal control problem with time delay , or controlled system with sdde , will be in an infinite dimensional space framework .",
    "moreover , their solvability in the infinite dimensional spaces is complicated and consequently their real applications are largely limited . due to the special dependence on the past trajectory via terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 in ( [ definition of delay terms ] ) , in this paper we first prove a sufficient maximum principle when the terminal condition @xmath45 has some linear form .",
