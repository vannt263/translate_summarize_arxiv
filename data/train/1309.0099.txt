    "<S> we consider the same ( 2d ) square network as above@xcite , now made of ab diblock copolymers which are endlinked such that a ends join a and b ends join b ( fig.[fig:2d_energy](a ) . by stretching the network in the @xmath75 direction , an average distance @xmath76 is imposed between neighboring a and b crosslinks , which induces a separation between a rich and b rich regions ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> this minimum dominates beyond @xmath77 , and the network undergoes an order - disorder transition ( odt ) from a disordered state ( with @xmath78 ) to a microphase separated lamellar state with lamellar spacing @xmath70 . compared to the noninteracting stretched structure at same @xmath62 , the stable lamellar state at the odt is characterized by higher segregation , and by a narrower , more localized crosslink distribution .    comparing the odt in the network to the odt in copolymer melts , one notices striking dissimilarities . </S>",
    "<S> first , the transition is strongly first order already at the mean - field level . </S>",
    "<S> second , stretching the system stabilizes the ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> free energy curves such as those shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the critical point in the network is thus found at much lower @xmath69 than the critical point in the melt ( @xmath81 ) . however , the odt in the stress - free system ( at @xmath82 ) , is only slightly shifted compared to the melt .     </S>",

    "<S> same as fig.[fig:2d_phases ] for a three - dimensional network with a bcc topology ( see cartoon inset in ( a ) ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the exact value of the odt depends on the network topology and on the spatial dimension . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we have also calculated the phase behavior for a three dimensional network with body - centered cubic ( bcc ) topology ( fig .  [ fig:3d_phases ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram is similar to the two - dimensional one . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the odt is more pronounced , but still not spectacular . </S>",
    "<S> thus we find that weak crosslinking does not stabilize lamellar order efficiently , in agreement with the simulation results of lay _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the elastic behavior of the network . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the three - dimensional case , and calculate young s moduli for our bcc topology . in the isotropic disordered state , </S>",
    "<S> the modulus is given by @xmath83 , indicating that the network becomes stiff at high strand density @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in the ordered state , the modulus depends on the direction of applied stress . the elastic response to stretching in the direction normal to the lamellae is stiffer than in the isotropic case , @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the system is soft in the parallel directions , with a modulus that does not depend on @xmath3 at all , @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the elastic penalty for stretching lamellae in plane is found to be much smaller than the penalty for stretching them in the normal direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with a prediction of panyukov and rubinstein @xcite based on a phenomenological model for networks . on applying stress to a microphase separated system with initially randomly oriented lamellae , </S>",
    "<S> one thus expects the lamellae to be kinetically driven towards aligning parallel to the applied stress . </S>",
    "<S> this was indeed observed experimentally @xcite . the true state of lowest free energy , however , is one where the lamellae are oriented normal to the stress , such that the ( elongated ) copolymer strands are aligned parallel to the applied force . </S>",
    "<S> lamellae with parallel orientation can only reach this state by copolymer reordering , which involves crossing an energy barrier . </S>",
    "<S> hence the parallel orientation might be stabilized kinetically in many cases , even though the true equilibrium state is one with normal orientation .    to summarize , we have presented a way to extend the scf theory to quenched polymer networks . </S>",
    "<S> it opens up a wide range of new applications for the scf approach , such as the study of chemically or physically crosslinked systems , or of liquid crystalline elastomers ( using suitable extensions of the scf theory @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the approach to study the odt in networks of diblock copolymers , and the results were compatible with available simulations , experiments , and phenomenological theories .    in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> the theory was developed for regular networks . </S>",
    "<S> the next step in future work will be to include disorder , and disorder averages , e.g. , within a cpa ( coherent potential approximation ) type approach . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , it will be interesting to establish the connection to classical field theories of networks based on the deam - edwards approach @xcite , which focus on the process of generating topological disorder during crosslinking . </S>",
    "<S> another important issue is the effect of entanglements . </S>",
    "<S> the present theory ignores topological interactions by construction ( since the monomers have no hard - core interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of entanglements may be similar to that of physical crosslinks , e.g. , in interpenetrating networks @xcite , and it might be possible to treat them as effective crosslinks in some cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the present theory can also be used as a starting point for simpler landau - type expansions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the derivation of a rpa ( random phase approximation ) theory @xcite for networks might give additional insight into the nature of the phase transitions in the system .    </S>",
