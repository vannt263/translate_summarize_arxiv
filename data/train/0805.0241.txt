    "we also show that , for protographs with regular degree distributions , the free distance bounds are consistent with those recently derived for regular ldpc convolutional code ensembles in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in this section we present a method for obtaining a lower bound on the free distance of an ensemble of unterminated , asymptotically good , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional codes derived from protograph - based ldpc block codes . to proceed ,",

    "rearranging the positions of these two triangular matrices and repeating them indefinitely results in a parity - check matrix @xmath71 of an unterminated , periodically time - varying convolutional code with constraint length @xmath72 and period @xmath73 given by of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 divides @xmath76 without remainder . if @xmath77 then the resulting convolutional code is time - invariant . ]",

    "this trivial cut results in a convolutional code with syndrome former memory zero , with repeating blocks of the original protograph on the leading diagonal .",
    "it is necessary in this case to create a larger protograph parity - check matrix by using the copy and permute operation on @xmath37 .",
    "this results in an @xmath83 parity - check matrix for some small integer @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 protograph parity - check matrix can then be cut following the procedure outlined above . in effect , the choice of @xmath86 permutation matrix creates a mini ensemble of block codes suitable to be unwrapped to an ensemble of convolutional codes .",
    "we now introduce the notion of tail - biting convolutional codes by defining an ` unwrapping factor ' @xmath87 as the number of times the sliding convolutional structure is repeated . for @xmath88 , the parity - check matrix @xmath89 of the desired tail - biting convolutional code",
    "can be written as @xmath90_{\\lambda n_c \\times \\lambda n_v}.\\ ] ]    note that the tail - biting convolutional code for @xmath91 is simply the original block code .",
    "given a protograph parity - check matrix @xmath37 , we generate a family of tail - biting convolutional codes with increasing block lengths @xmath92 , @xmath93 , using the process described above .",
    "since tail - biting convolutional codes are themselves block codes , we can treat the tanner graph of @xmath89 as a protograph for each value of @xmath87 . replacing the entries of this matrix with either @xmath94 permutation matrices or @xmath36 all zero matrices , as discussed in section [ sec : proto ] ,",
    "creates an ensemble of ldpc codes that can be analyzed asymptotically as @xmath39 goes to infinity , where the sparsity condition of an ldpc code is satisfied for large @xmath39 .",
    "each tail - biting ldpc code ensemble , in turn , can be unwrapped and repeated indefinitely to form an ensemble of unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional codes with constraint length @xmath95 and , in general , period @xmath96 .",
    "intuitively , as @xmath87 increases , the tail - biting code becomes a better representation of the associated unterminated convolutional code , with @xmath97 corresponding to the unterminated convolutional code itself .",
    "this is reflected in the weight enumerators , and it is shown in section [ sec : results ] that increasing @xmath87 provides us with distance growth rates that converge to a lower bound on the free distance growth rate of the unterminated convolutional code .",
    "tail - biting convolutional codes can be used to establish a lower bound on the free distance of an associated unterminated , periodically time - varying convolutional code by showing that the free distance of the unterminated code is lower bounded by the minimum distance of any of its tail - biting versions .",
    "a proof can be found in @xcite .    consider a rate @xmath98 unterminated , periodically time - varying convolutional code with decoding constraint length @xmath99 and period @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath100 be the minimum distance of the associated tail - biting convolutional code with length @xmath101 and unwrapping factor @xmath102 .",
    "then the free distance @xmath103 of the unterminated convolutional code is lower bounded by @xmath100 for any unwrapping factor @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath104    a trivial corollary of the above theorem is that the minimum distance of a protograph - based ldpc block code is a lower bound on the free distance of the associated unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional code .",
    "this can be observed by setting @xmath105 .",
    "one must be careful in comparing the distance growth rates of codes with different underlying structures .",
    "a fair basis for comparison generally requires equating the complexity of encoding and/or decoding of the two codes . traditionally , the minimum distance growth rate of block codes is measured relative to block length , whereas constraint length is used to measure the free distance growth rate of convolutional codes .",
    "these measures are based on the complexity of decoding both types of codes on a trellis .",
    "indeed , the typical number of states required to decode a block code on a trellis is exponential in the block length , and similarly the number of states required to decode a convolutional code is exponential in the constraint length .",
    "this has been an accepted basis of comparing block and convolutional codes for decades , since maximum - likelihood decoding can be implemented on a trellis for both types of codes .",
    "the definition of decoding complexity is different , however , for ldpc codes .",
    "the sparsity of their parity - check matrices , along with the iterative message - passing decoding algorithm typically employed , implies that the decoding complexity per symbol depends on the degree distribution of the variable and check nodes and is independent of both the block length and the constraint length .",
    "the cutting technique we described in section [ sec : tb ] preserves the degree distribution of the underlying ldpc block code , and thus the decoding complexity per symbol is the same for the block and convolutional codes considered in this paper .",
    "also , for randomly constructed ldpc block codes , state - of - the - art encoding algorithms require only @xmath106 operations per symbol , where @xmath107 @xcite , whereas for ldpc convolutional codes , if the parity - check matrix satisfies the conditions listed in section ii , the number of encoding operations per symbol is only @xmath108 @xcite . here again , the encoding complexity per symbol is essentially independent of both the block length and the constraint length .    hence , to compare the distance growth rates of ldpc block and convolutional codes",
    ", we consider the hardware complexity of implementing the encoding and decoding operations in hardware .",
    "typical hardware storage requirements for both ldpc block encoders and decoders are proportional to the block length @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding hardware storage requirements for ldpc convolutional encoders and decoders are proportional to the decoding constraint length @xcite .",
    ", encoding constraint lengths may be preferred to decoding constriant lengths . for further details ,",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "we now present distance growth rate results for several ensembles of rate @xmath109 asymptotically good ldpc convolutional codes based on protographs .    _",
    "example @xmath110 _ consider a @xmath111 regular ldpc code with the folowing protograph :        for this example , the minimum distance growth rate is @xmath112 , as originally calculated by gallager @xcite .",
    "a family of tail - biting ldpc convolutional code ensembles can be generated according to the following cut :        for each @xmath87 , the minimum distance growth rate @xmath61 was calculated for the tail - biting ldpc convolutional codes using the approach outlined in section [ sec : tailll ] .",
    "the distance growth rates for each @xmath87 are given as @xmath113 the free distance growth rate of the associated rate @xmath109 ensemble of unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional codes is @xmath114 , as discussed above .",
    "then ( [ emre ] ) gives us the lower bound @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "these growth rates are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] .",
    ".,width=307 ]    we observe that , once the unwrapping factor @xmath87 of the tail - biting convolutional codes exceeds @xmath117 , the lower bound on @xmath118 levels off at @xmath119 , which agrees with the results presented in @xcite and @xcite and represents a significant increase over the value of @xmath61 . in this case , the minimum weight codeword in the unterminated convolutional code also appears as a codeword in the tail - biting code .",
    "example @xmath120 _ the following irregular protograph is from the repeat jagged accumulate @xcite ( rja ) family .",
    "it was shown to have a good iterative decoding threshold ( @xmath121 db ) while maintaining linear minimum distance growth ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "we display below the associated @xmath37 matrix and cut used to generate the family of tail - biting ldpc convolutional code ensembles .",
    "we observe that , as in example @xmath110 , the minimum distance growth rates calculated for increasing @xmath87 provide us with a lower bound on the free distance growth rate of the convolutional code ensemble using ( [ lb ] ) .",
    "the lower bound was calculated as @xmath123 ( for @xmath124 ) , significantly larger than the minimum distance growth rate @xmath61 of the underlying block code ensemble .    _",
    "example @xmath117 _ the following irregular protograph is from the accumulate repeat jagged accumulate family ( arja ) @xcite :        where the undarkened circle represents a punctured variable node .",
    "this protograph is of significant practical interest , since it was shown to have @xmath125 and iterative decoding threshold @xmath126 , i.e. , pre - coding the protograph of example @xmath120 provides an improvement in both values .    in this arja example",
    ", the protograph matrix @xmath37 is of size @xmath127 .",
    "we observe that gcd@xmath79 , and thus we have the trivial cut mentioned in section [ sec : tb ]",
    ". we must then copy and permute @xmath37 to generate a mini ensemble of block codes .",
    "results are shown for one particular member of the mini ensemble with @xmath128 , but a change in performance can be obtained by varying the particular permutation chosen .",
    "increasing @xmath87 for the chosen permutation results in a lower bound , found using ( [ lb ] ) , of @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "again , we observe a significant increase in @xmath118 compared to @xmath61 .",
    "simulation results for ldpc block and convolutional codes based on the protograph of example @xmath117 were obtained assuming bpsk modulation and an additive white gaussian noise channel ( awgnc ) .",
    "all decoders were allowed a maximum of @xmath131 iterations , and the block code decoders employed a syndrome - check based stopping rule . as a result of their block structure",
    ", tail - biting ldpc convolutional codes were decoded using standard ldpc block decoders employing a belief - propagation decoding algorithm .",
    "the ldpc convolutional code , on the other hand , was decoded by a sliding - window based belief - propagation decoder @xcite .",
    "the resulting bit error rate ( ber ) performance is shown in fig.[fig : sim ] .",
    ".,width=336 ]    we note that the protograph - based tail - biting ldpc convolutional codes outperform the underlying protograph - based ldpc block code ( which can also be seen as a tail - biting code with unwrapping factor @xmath132 ) .",
    "larger unwrapping factors yield improved error performance , eventually approaching the performance of the unterminated convolutional code , which can be seen as a tail - biting code with an infinitely large unwrapping factor .",
    "we also note that no error floor is observed for the convolutional code , which is expected , since the code ensemble is asymptotically good and has a relatively large ( @xmath129 ) distance growth rate .",
    "we also note that the performance of the unterminated ldpc convolutional code is consistent with the iterative decoding threshold computed for the underlying protograph . at a moderate constraint length of @xmath133",
    ", the unterminated code achieves @xmath134 ber at roughly @xmath135 db away from the threshold , and with larger block ( constraint ) lengths , the performance will improve even further .",
    "this is expected , since both the unterminated and the tail - biting convolutional codes preserve the same degree distribution as the underlying protograph .",
    "in this paper , asymptotic methods were used to calculate a lower bound on the free distance that grows linearly with constraint length for several ensembles of unterminated , protograph - based periodically time varying ldpc convolutional codes .",
    "it was shown that the free distance growth rates of the ldpc convolutional code ensembles exceed the minimum distance growth rates of the corresponding ldpc block code ensembles .",
