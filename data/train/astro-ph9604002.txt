    "one of the main objectives of the searches for microlensing events ( paczyski 1996 , and references therein ) is to determine the mass function of the lensing objects .",

    "it is recognized that even if all lensing objects were of the same mass @xmath1 , they would give rise to a broad range of time scales @xmath2 of the observed microlensing events .",
    "although this is known to a relatively small number of people in the field this fact is not generally appreciated . considering the broad interest in the nature of dark matter , and the relevance of microlensing searches to this problem",
    ", we feel it is justified to present a very simple model of the lens distribution and kinematics which allows some results to be obtained analytically , and the rest can be calculated with one - dimensional numerical integrals .",
    "this model retains some of the most important generic characteristics : a very broad distribution of @xmath2 with power law tails towards very short and very long time scales for a delta function distribution of lens masses . using monte carlo simulations we demonstrate how difficult it is to obtain accurate information about the mass function even within the framework of our simple model . in reality",
    "one is not sure what is the correct space distribution and kinematics of lensing masses , making the interpretation even more difficult .",
    "the model is described in the next section .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulations are presented in section 3 , and the discussion of the results is given in the last section .",
    "the technical details of the model can be found in the appendix .",
    "we consider a simple case that may approximate a real astrophysical system : the lenses , each of the same mass @xmath1 , have their distances @xmath3 distributed uniformly and randomly between the observer and a stationary source , which is at a distance @xmath4 .",
    "the time scale of a microlensing event is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative spatial velocity between the lens and the observer , @xmath7 is the angle between the velocity vector and the line of sight , and @xmath8 is the einstein ring radius : @xmath9 more technical details about our model are given in the appendix . in this section",
    "we present only the most essential information .",
    "the lenses in our model have a three - dimensional gaussian velocity distribution with a one - dimensional dispersion of @xmath10 .",

    "\\eqno(5c)\\ ] ]    naturally , formula ( 4 ) applies only to our simple model of the lens distribution and kinematics .",
    "however , the presence of power law tails is common to almost all distributions ever proposed ( e.g. , those in zhao et al . 1996 ) and can be understood intuitively .",
    "the very long events are produced by the lenses which move almost along the line of sight .",
    "for these events the time scale @xmath21 is inversely proportional to @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "the number of these events , @xmath24 , is proportional to the solid angle @xmath25 divided by @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "the short events are produced by the lenses which are very close to either the source or the observer .",
    "for the latter case , @xmath27 , and the number of these events is @xmath28 .",
    "the same argument applies when the lenses are close to the source .",
    "it is not likely that all the lenses have identical masses , and it is convenient to consider a power law mass distribution @xmath29 where @xmath30 and we denote the logarithmic width of the mass function by @xmath31 the exponent @xmath32 corresponds to an equal rate of microlensing events per decade of lens masses , while the case @xmath33 corresponds to an equal contribution to the optical depth per decade of lens masses . for @xmath34 , the optical depth ( total mass )",
    "is dominated by the massive objects , while the event rate is dominated by the low mass objects . for a given mass range",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath35 is the largest for @xmath32 . for @xmath36",
    "the mass spectrum is dominated by low mass objects , and the event time scales have a small effective range , with the majority of events caused by lenses with @xmath37 . in the opposite case , with @xmath38 , the microlensing events are dominated by lenses with @xmath39 . therefore for @xmath40 , the standard deviation in @xmath41 approaches some asymptotic value when @xmath42 , and similarly for @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",

    "( 5c ) .",
    "the probability distribution functions for the logarithm of event time scale for any lens mass function can be calculated by convolving the mass function with the probability distribution for a @xmath15 mass function as given in eq .",
    "the probability distributions for @xmath48 , are shown in fig .",
    "all time scales are in units of @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "eqs . 2 and 6 ) . also shown is the case for @xmath51 , i.e. , with all the lenses having identical masses ( cf .",
    "the shapes for mass functions with a narrow width ( @xmath52 ) are quite similar .",
    "this can be easily understood because the time scale of microlensing @xmath53 , therefore one decade of mass range translates to a factor of three in the time scale , hence the shapes of these distributions still resemble that for a @xmath15 mass function .",
    "we present two types of monte carlo simulations . in both cases",
    "we adopt the model of lens distribution and kinematics as developed in the previous section .",
    "first , we consider a perfect detection system , which can detect every event of any time scale , and a lens population with a moderately broad power law mass function .",
    "next we consider very broad lens mass functions and a detection system which is like that of the macho and ogle collaborations , i.e. , it has a significant detection efficiency over a relatively narrow range of event time scales . in both cases",
    "we make a large number of the monte carlo simulations to determine the accuracy with which the lens mass function parameters can be estimated with a moderately large number of detected events : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "we tried both the moment method and the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 . although the moment analysis is faster and in many cases its results agree with that from the maximum likelihood , it is less accurate and in some cases does not work at all .",
    "one of the reasons is very easy to understand .",
    "imagine we have a random sample of microlensing events with variance smaller than @xmath59 , as given by eq .",
    "such cases are unavoidable in a finite sample drawn from a distribution with @xmath60 .",
    "the moment analysis fails for these cases .",
    "this reminds us of a similar old problem : what to do with negative trigonometric parallaxes of distant stars , the negative numbers being due to the unavoidable measurement errors ? for this reason , we only present the results from the maximum likelihood method with a prior of equal probability in @xmath61 and @xmath62 . however , general discussions are given using the more intuitive moment analysis .",
    "we adopt a power law lens mass function described with two dimensionless parameters : the power law exponent @xmath57 , and the range of masses @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "in addition , we have two scaling parameters : @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( cf . eq .",
    "other things being equal the optical depth and the rate of microlensing events are proportional to @xmath64 , while the average time scale of the events is proportional to @xmath66 . out of the four parameters ,",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath67 can be fixed by the observed event rate , after which we are still left with three parameters .",
    "we can simplify the problem further by identifying a mass scale in the problem . in most cases ,",
    "we assume such a scale is provided by a fixed upper mass limit , say @xmath68 , but we also explore another possibility ( see below ) .",
    "we assume that the lens detection system is perfect , i.e. , it is 100% efficient for all event time scales .",
    "a large number of monte carlo samples are generated with the _ average _ number of events @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the actual number of events was chosen from a poisson distribution , followed by a monte carlo selection of event time scales according to the model probability distributions , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "we selected two models with @xmath69 , each for two sample sizes : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 and @xmath73 contours are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that for the case of @xmath74 , the power law index @xmath61 can not be determined very well with 100 events , the case for @xmath75 , however , is improved .",
    "the large difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is because for @xmath76 , the shapes , and therefore the variances , of the duration distributions for different power law indices are similar ( cf .",
    "the main difference between the models is the average duration , i.e. , the first moment of the duration distribution .",
    "however , such difference can be accommodated by slightly changing the lower mass limit .",
    "the power law index @xmath61 is then mostly constrained by the more uncertain higher moments , and hence the weak limit .",
    "the case with a broader mass function , @xmath78 , is better constrained than that for @xmath76 with a sample of @xmath55 microlensing events , but even this case is very poorly constrained when @xmath54 , as shown with the dotted contours in fig .",
    "2 . note that the total number of microlensing events detected so far towards the lmc is smaller than 10 ( bennett et al . 1996 ) and the spatial distribution and kinematics of the lenses are not known , making the case even more ill - constrained .",
    "the contours shown in fig . 2 are based the assumption that the upper mass limit is known .",
    "such a fixed upper limit sets the mass scale in the maximum likelihood method and translates the observed average duration ( i.e. , the first moment of the duration distribution ) into a constraint on the lower mass limit . in reality",
    ", we do not know the upper mass limit well .",
    "in fact , this upper limit should also be found from the maximum likelihood .",
    "however , it is too time consuming to conduct such a three dimensional study .",
    "instead we adopt a different approach : for a given set of @xmath79 , we fix the mass scale such that it gives identical first moment in the duration distribution as a generated monte carlo sample .",
    "this reduces the three - dimensional problem into a two dimensional one , and should be a reasonable approximation . as the first moment has been utilized to set the mass scale ,",
    "the determination of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is then effectively based on the second and higher moments , and these are subject to larger random uncertainties .",
    "the likelihood contours shown in fig .",
    "2 confirms this for @xmath80 with @xmath70 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "just as expected , the limit is relaxed  the allowed parameter space is increased by a factor of @xmath81 .",
    "this is a consequence of the determination made with the maximum likelihood ( or any other ) method effectively using the higher moments of the event distribution .    with the monte carlo samples",
    ", we can also estimate the optical depth of microlensing , @xmath82 , which is proportional to the number of events observed per unit time per unit number of stars .",
    "the error of the optical depth estimate is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of events , @xmath83 , with a coefficient somewhat larger than unity , as the relatively few longest events are most important .",
    "this coefficient depends on the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "for example , the coefficients are 1.3 , 1.5 , 1.3 , 1.6 for @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "this is in good agreement with han & gould ( 1995 ) .",
    "if we have 100 microlensing events , and if we can trust our model of the lens distribution and kinematics , then we can estimate the value of @xmath82 with an accuracy of @xmath85 .",
    "now we consider a very broad mass function with @xmath86 , so the time scales of microlensing events cover the range @xmath87 .",
    "we adopt the efficiency of event detectability similar to those published by the ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 ) and macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1995a ) collaborations .",

    "( 2 ) we may relate this time scale to a mass scale @xmath91    again we adopt a power law mass function as given by eq .",
    "it is convenient to express the lower and upper mass limits in units of @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the probability distributions of event time scales for very broad mass functions , with @xmath95 and slopes @xmath96 , are shown in fig .",
    "3 . also shown is the efficiency of event detection as described with eq .",
    "( 10 ) .",
    "if the probability function of event time scales is much broader than the width of the detectability window as given by eq .",
    "( 10 ) then most events can not be detected .",
    "we shall consider two cases .",
    "first , a mass function extending very far towards low masses , i.e. , with @xmath97 , and the upper mass limit somewhat larger than @xmath98 .",
    "second , a mass function extending very far towards large masses , i.e. , with @xmath99 , and the lower mass limit somewhat smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "we shall investigate the ability of the detection system to measure @xmath100 in the first case , and @xmath101 in the second case .",
    "in all the simulations we adopt the average number of detected events to be either @xmath55 or @xmath56 , the actual number being drawn from a poisson distribution .",
    "assuming that @xmath97 we can search for the remaining two dimensionless parameters : @xmath57 and @xmath100 using the maximum likelihood method , with @xmath67 being fixed by the event rate .",
    "the results of model calculations are shown in the right panel of fig . 4 for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . with 100 events ,",
    "@xmath61 is well constrained in both cases .",
    "the parameter @xmath104 , however , becomes not so well - determined for @xmath105 .",
    "assuming that @xmath99 we can search for the remaining two dimensionless parameters : @xmath57 and @xmath101 using the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the results of model calculations are shown in the left panel of fig . 4 for ( @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is again well constrained for @xmath70 . in comparison ,",
    "the parameter @xmath108 becomes ill - determined when it approaches @xmath109 .",
    "note that the models with @xmath110 and @xmath111 have contours slightly shifted with respect to the true model values , as marked with crosses .",
    "if the distribution of event time scales is approaching the effective edge of the detectability window then some finite samples of events generate second ( and other ) moments which are incompatible with the model .",
    "for such cases a method using the moments simply fails .",
    "the maximum likelihood method can better handle such cases , but has some trouble as well for @xmath70 , as indicated by the small shifts of contours in fig .",
    "this can be remedied with a larger sample size such as @xmath71 ( thick dashed lines ) in both cases .",
    "given the determination of @xmath57 and either @xmath101 or @xmath100 , as well as the ` observed ' number of events ` n ' we may estimate the parameter @xmath64 in eq . ( 6 ) . the error of the estimate can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the standard deviation in the @xmath114 ratio .",
    "the coefficient @xmath115 depends somewhat on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but is generally in the range between 1 and 1.6 .",
    "the monte carlo simulations presented in this paper demonstrate that even if we have a full knowledge of the space distribution and kinematics of the lensing objects , or equivalently , if we know the relation between the lens mass and the distribution of event time scales ( see eq . 4 for an example )",
    ", it may still be difficult to obtain the parameters of the lens mass function .",
    "the problem is particularly serious when the width of the mass function is narrow ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in addition , if the mass function power law is quite different from @xmath116 , then it will be difficult to probe the high mass end when @xmath117 , and the low mass end when @xmath118 ( cf .",
    "recently , han & gould ( 1996 ) obtained a rather tight limit on the mass function of the galactic disk using about 50 microlensing events toward the galactic bulge . in their analysis ,",
    "the upper mass limit is fixed at @xmath119 in a rather ad hoc manner . as we have shown in fig . 2",
    ", such a fixed upper mass limit will make the determination of the other parameters appear more accurate .",
    "a more realistic approach is to estimate the upper mass limit using the maximum likelihood in order to avoid carrying our a priori assumption into a limit on the physical parameters . in general ,",
    "if at least three separate parameters are to be estimated , for example @xmath120 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , then any method must effectively use the information contained in at least the first three moments .",
    "however , the higher the moment the more uncertain is its value as estimated from a relatively small sample of events .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the determination of any distribution parameter is lower in the 3-parameter determination than in a 2-parameter determination . unfortunately , the smaller errors in a 2-parameter determination could be misleading , unless we have an independent and reliable information about the value of the third parameter .    in our second example",
    ", very broad mass functions are sampled through a realistic detectability window ( cf .",
    "the current published sensitivity windows allow one to probe about three to four decades of mass range and we find that the `` amplitude '' @xmath64 and the local slope of the lens mass function @xmath57 can be determined reasonably well with @xmath0 events .",
    "however , the estimate of the range of masses within the detectability window , @xmath101 or @xmath100 , may be very uncertain with as many as @xmath55 events , as shown in fig .",
    "if the mass function is broader than the detectability window then the total event rate or the total optical depth ( or total mass ) can not be measured as the majority of events are outside the detectability window ( fig .",
    "3 ) , having either too short or too long @xmath2 .",
    "this points to the necessity of broadening the detectability window , a task easy to accomplish in the near future .",
    "some first attempts have already been made by the eros ( ansari et al .",
    "1995 ) and macho collaborations ( bennett et al . 1996 ) .",
    "how can we be sure that we have reached the low and the high mass end of the lens distribution ? in principle this is simple : we have to broaden the detectability window and we should detect so many events that the generic power law tails in the distribution ( cf .",
    "3 ) become apparent .",
    "this may call for well over 100 events .",
    "such a high number of events is within reach for the galactic bulge , where the rate appears to be very high ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 , alcock et al .",
    "1995b , c ) .",
    "the determinations of any parameters of the distribution of lens masses based on as few as 10 events are subject to very large uncertainties , as shown with the dotted contours in fig .",
    "2 .    in reality we do not know what the geometry of the lens distribution is , and what is the lens kinematics .",
    "while looking towards the galactic bulge the majority of lenses may be in the bulge itself ( kiraga & paczyski 1994 , udalski et al .",
    "1994 , paczyski et al .",
    "1994 , zhao et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) , or they may be in the disk ( alcock et al .",
    "1995b , c ) .",
    "while looking towards the lmc the majority of lenses may be in our galaxy ( alcock et al .",
    "1995a ) or in the lmc ( sahu 1994 ; wu 1994 ) .",
    "depending on the location and kinematics the relation between the lens masses and the event time scale @xmath2 may be very different , and this leads to an additional major uncertainty on top of purely statistical uncertainty discussed in this paper .",
    "it seems rather difficult to disentangle all parameters one needs to describe the distribution and kinematics of the lenses _ and _ their mass function on the basis of the observed distribution of event time scale .",
    "fortunately , the future studies of the variation of the optical depth with the location in the sky will help to identify the lens location .",
    "if lensing of the galactic bulge stars is dominated by the bulge lenses then the optical depth should vary rapidly with the galactic longitude ( kiraga & paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "if such a variation is not present this will indicate that the lenses are located mostly in the galactic disk .",
    "if lensing towards the lmc is dominated by the lmc lenses then the optical depth should increase strongly towards the lmc center ( sahu 1994 )",
    ". if the optical depth is uniform over the lmc then the lenses must be mostly in our galaxy .",
    "this is very simple in principle , but it will take hundreds of events to establish beyond reasonable doubt",
    ". such a large number will be readily collected towards the galactic bulge , but it will take a very long time for the lmc as the rate in that direction is very low ( alcock et al",
    ". 1995a ) .",
    "once the geometry of the lens distribution is established it will be possible to develop reliable models of their kinematics , and infer a reasonable statistical relation between the lens masses and the event time scales @xmath2 .",
