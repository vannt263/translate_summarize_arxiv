    "the availability of such isotopically enriched silicon is of great interest for spectroscopy since it can significantly reduce inhomogeneous spectral linewidths and therefore improve spectral resolution . for example , two recent reports have resolved new fine structures in the optical spectra of phosphorus donors@xcite and in the electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra of boron acceptors@xcite in @xmath0si .",
    "these fine spectral structures were unresolvable in natural silicon because of the inhomogeneous broadening arising from the presence of magnetic @xmath11si nuclei .",

    "a weak line is also observed at the center of the donor doublet that arises from pairs of donors that are close enough to form exchange ( @xmath2 ) coupled dimers@xcite .",
    "since the crystals are randomly doped , the dimers are present with a broad range of distances between dopants and therefore a broad distribution of @xmath2 couplings .",

    "[ fig : spectra](b ) , we show that the reduced linewidth in @xmath0si allows us to observe a new fine structure in the dimer esr line with a splitting of about . since @xmath2 is greater than @xmath19 , the eigenstates of the dimer consist of a spin-0 singlet ( @xmath20 ) and three spin-1 triplet states ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and our esr experiment probes transitions among the three triplet states .",
    "below , we will explain through simulations that this new fine structure is a result of the second order mixing between the @xmath20 and @xmath22 states .",
    "this mixing arises from an interplay between the @xmath1p hyperfine , exchange and zeeman energies , with the mixing being strongest when the exchange coupling is approximately equal to the zeeman energy .",
    "further , we will show that this mixing allows the use of esr transitions between the triplet states to probe spin relaxation between the @xmath20 and @xmath22 triplet state , even though the @xmath20 state is esr - silent in our experiments .",
    "we performed pulsed esr to measure spin relaxation times @xmath7 and @xmath8 of dimers , in order to examine whether the presence of exchange coupling within the dimer gives rise to decoherence in excess of that for the isolated donor .",
    "the exchange interaction between two phosphorus donors is the canonical method to implement a two - qubit gate @xcite , and therefore any additional decoherence arising from exchange would be of critical importance for donor - based quantum computing schemes .",
    "such decoherence can be caused by charge noise modulating the @xmath2-coupling , which would be an especially significant issue for donors near an interface and next to the control gates@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath20@xmath22 state mixing arising from @xmath2-coupling opens an additional relaxation ( @xmath7 ) pathway through the electron - phonon interaction@xcite .",
    "these mechanisms could thus limit the usability of exchange to perform multi - qubit operations . in our experiments ,",
    "the ability to resolve a fine structure in the dimer esr line enables us to separately address two dimer sub - ensembles , the first with @xmath2 ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6  ghz and the second with @xmath2 ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4  ghz .",
    "we find that the relaxation times of these two dimer sub - ensembles are identical to that of isolated donors , thus limited by the same mechanism , namely spectral diffusion due to dipolar interactions with flip - flopping neighboring donors@xcite .",
    "thus , we find that the presence of @xmath2-coupling of @xmath3 in dimers does not introduce any additional decoherence in bulk si on a timescale of .",
    "an esr experiment directly probes the spin - dynamics among the triplet ( @xmath24 ) states of the dimer .",
    "however , high - fidelity two - qubit gates require maintaining the coherence between all four spin states including the @xmath20 state .",
    "although our esr experiments do not allow any direct information about the esr - silent @xmath20 state , nevertheless some important estimates can be made from @xmath8 times measured for @xmath24 states .",
    "specifically , the one - phonon @xmath7 process from @xmath22 to @xmath20 , arising from the @xmath2-induced mixing@xcite , can result in an irreversible leakage of coherence from the triplet state during hahn echo experiments .",
    "this would potentially result in faster @xmath8 decay times , which we do not see in our experiment .",
    "our measured @xmath25  ms for triplet states thus implies that @xmath26 must be slower than .",
    "this lower bound , consistent with recent theoretical calculations@xcite and experimental results@xcite , is encouraging for spin - based quantum computing schemes since it suggests that the presence of exchange coupling does not cause any additional relaxation between the triplet and singlet states at the level of about in a bulk crystal .    finally , while measuring @xmath8 using a standard hahn echo experiment@xcite , we observed an unusual dependence of the echo decay on pulse lengths and powers . through numerical simulations",
    "we explain that this dependence arises from electron spin echo envelope modulation ( eseem ) effects in high - spin dimers@xcite and destructive interference of the eseem from different dimers due to a broad @xmath2-coupling distribution in the ensemble .",
    "these eseem effects , while creating additional difficulties in our experiments , can be viewed as a spectroscopic signature of @xmath2-coupled dimers and as such can be useful in studying donor dimers and also other coupled dimers .",
    "esr experiments were performed using isotopically enriched @xmath0si epi - layer wafers ( of @xmath0si and of @xmath11si ) doped with phosphorus to a density of @xcite . for comparison , we also measured a natural silicon crystal doped with phosphorus to a density of .",

    "therefore , only one of the transitions is selectively excited in each dimer ( in practice other transitions are still excited but to a lesser extent than the selected transition ) , and thus the resulting echo decays should show no ( or greatly reduced ) eseem oscillations .",
    "the destructive interference should be greatly suppressed , and the echo signal should last for longer times . indeed , this is what we find in experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem](b ) ) ; both high and low power traces show comparably long decays and no sharp dependence on microwave power is observed as expected .    before proceeding to numerical simulations of these eseem effects ,",
    "we need to clarify our choice of microwave powers ( @xmath137 fields ) in the experiments shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : eseem](a ) and ( b ) . for a spin with @xmath138 as in our dimers , the choice of optimal power ( that at given pulse durations produces @xmath139 rotations and thus a maximal echo signal ) depends on whether pulses are selective or non - selective . in case of non - selective pulses that excite both triplet transitions ,",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath141 , the optimal power for the dimer spin ( @xmath142 ) is the same as for a @xmath136 spin ( e.g. isolated donors ) .",
    "on the other hand , in case of selective pulses that excite only one of the triplet transitions , the optimal power should be a factor of 2 smaller ( 3  db lower ) because the rabi frequency for @xmath142 is a factor of @xmath143 faster than for @xmath144 ( ref .  , chapter 6 ) . in our setup , the powers ( ) for - ( - ) pulses were calibrated such as to produce @xmath139 rotations ( and a maximal echo signal ) for isolated donor spins @xmath136 .",
    "thus , the power required to achieve @xmath145 rotations on a dimer selectively or non - selectively were @xmath146  db or @xmath147  db , respectively .",
    "this calibration procedure allows us to connect the power levels in the experiments with the microwave pulse rotation angle to be used for numerical simulations discussed next .",
    "s assuming a linewidth of , a magnetic field centered on the high field line of the dimer spectrum and pulse lengths in ( a ) , ( b ) of - ( non - selective pulses ) and in ( c ) , ( d ) of - ( selective pulses ) .",
    "the traces are offset for clarity and the zero line for each trace is marked with dashed lines . in ( a ) , pulse power set so that a pulse rotates a donor spin by @xmath148 . in ( c ) , pulse power set so that a pulse rotates a donor spin by @xmath148 .",
    "pulse power in ( b ) and ( d ) are set lower than ( a ) and ( c ) respectively.[fig : eseem , diffj ] ]    we numerically simulated the echo signal intensity as a function of @xmath30 for dimers with given @xmath2 , including the magnetic field offset and esr linewidth as in the experiment .",
    "the echo intensity is calculated from the expectation value of @xmath149 traced over the final density matrix @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the time evolution operator for the pulse sequence and @xmath152 is the pseudo - pure initial density matrix .",
    "@xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the evolution operators during the pulses , and @xmath156 is a free evolution operator between the pulses .",
    "the free evolution operator is @xmath157 , where @xmath53 is the spin - hamiltonian of a dimer ( eq .  [ eq : ham ] ) , and @xmath30 is the delay between pulses .",
    "the pulse operators are @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the hamiltonian of the microwave pulse , and @xmath160 is the pulse length .",
    "calculations using the full @xmath161 hamiltonian of a dimer were found to be extremely demanding of cpu power , especially when taking a large number of time steps and averaging over several parameters .",
    "therefore we sped up the calculation by dividing the full @xmath161 hamiltonian matrix @xmath53 into four @xmath162 matrices ( triplet states @xmath142 , one for each out of four nuclear spin states ) and four @xmath163 matrices ( singlet state @xmath164 ) .",
    "we numerically confirmed that the mixing between these matrices is negligible during the spin evolution ( less than 0.1% ) , and therefore each matrix can be evaluated independently .",
    "only two @xmath162 matrices need to be evaluated for the 6 dimer eigenstates involved in the central dimer line .",
    "the echo signal is calculated by integrating the echo intensity over a window of centered on @xmath165 , similar to the experiment .",
    "the simulated traces were averaged over the inhomogeneous esr linewidth by including a term @xmath166 in @xmath53 , where @xmath167 is an offset magnetic field as seen by a dimer in the ensemble due to inhomogeneity ( a gaussian linewidth of was assumed as found in cw esr simulations ) .",
    "the representative results of our simulations for @xmath168 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem , diffj ] .",
    "eseem oscillations are observed in all cases , including non - selective and selective pulses and also large and small pulse rotation angles ( pulse powers ) .",
    "the oscillation frequency scales proportionally to @xmath135 as expected .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is most pronounced when using non - selective pulses in combination with large rotation angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem , diffj](a ) ) .",
    "the oscillations span the full amplitude range , cross zero and invert the signal to negative .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is suppressed by a factor of 2 when using smaller rotation angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem , diffj](b ) ) .",
    "an important improvement with smaller rotations is that the echo traces contain a non - oscillatory ( i.e.  zero frequency ) component .",
    "the eseem oscillations are further suppressed with selective pulses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem , diffj](c and d ) ) , as expected because only one of the triplet transitions is selectively excited .",
    "further , the selective pulses at both rotation angles produce a non - oscillatory component in the echo trace .    to calculate the echo signal trace for the dimer ensemble in our silicon crystal we sum up traces like in fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem , diffj ] over the @xmath2 coupling distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jdistribution ] .",
    "the broad distribution of @xmath2 couplings implies a broad distribution of eseem frequencies . when summed up over this distribution",
    ", the oscillating components of the echo signals should average to zero ( because of a destructive interference between different frequencies ) and only the non - oscillatory components should survive .",
    "the summation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eseem](c and d ) .",
    "the resulting curves qualitatively correlate with the experimental results . in particular , for non - selective pulses and using large rotation angles , the simulated trace decays quickly to zero within the first two microseconds similar to the experiment at attenuation .",
    "other traces , including non - selective pulses with small rotation angles and selective pulses at both rotation angles , show a strong signal over a long time range .",
    "the residual oscillations seen in all simulated traces are possibly an artifact of averaging over the @xmath2 distribution ( the noise level in the experiment is higher than any of the predicted oscillations ) .",
    "thus , our simulations confirm that the fast decay of the echo at short @xmath30 s in some experiments is an artifact associated with eseem that arises from non - selectively exciting both @xmath169 and @xmath170 transitions of dimers . to remove this artifact and measure the true dimer @xmath8 decays requires using selective pulses .",
    "we have resolved a new fine structure in the esr spectra of exchange coupled phosphorus dimers in @xmath0si .",
    "this fine structure had not been observed in previous experiments because of the significant inhomogeneous esr linewidth caused by the presence of @xmath11si nuclei in natural silicon samples .",
    "we have shown through numerical simulations that this fine structure is a result of singlet - triplet state mixing due to the interplay of the exchange , hyperfine and zeeman energies , averaged over the broad @xmath2 distribution of dimers in doped silicon crystals .",
    "we have also measured the @xmath7 and @xmath8 for triplet state transitions of dimers in bulk @xmath0si .",
    "the @xmath8 experiment is complicated by the presence of eseem effects that depend on pulse lengths and powers . by appropriate choice of pulse parameters",
    ", we were able to suppress the eseem effect and measure the relaxation times .",
    "the observed eseem effects can be regarded as a spectroscopic signature of @xmath2-coupled dimers and can be used in other studies of exchange coupled systems . in ensemble experiments ,",
    "the eseem can show up as artificially fast relaxation decays , while in single dimer studies it might reveal observable modulation effects .",
    "we find that spin coherence times among the triplet states in dimers with @xmath128 at are not affected by the presence of @xmath2-coupling at least on time scales up to .",
    "while we were not able to observe the singlet - to - triplet transitions in dimers directly , we were able to estimate that @xmath7 leakage from the triplet to singlet state in dimers must be longer than , consistent with recent theoretical estimates@xcite and experimental results@xcite . note that we are currently unable to put bounds on the decay of coherences between the triplet and singlet state , which is an important topic for further study ,",
    "since these also limit the fidelity of a two - qubit gate implemented via @xmath2-coupling .",
    "furthermore , dimers close to an interface also need to be investigated since they may have shortened coherence , as seen for isolated donors@xcite .",
    "calculations of the @xmath2 coupling distributions in phosphorus doped silicon crystals have been previously reported in ref .  .",
    "we adapted the previously used methods to calculate the @xmath2 distribution for the donor density used in our experiments .",
    "we use a monte - carlo technique by repeatedly and randomly positioning dopants in a given volume . for a donor density @xmath171 ,",
    "the side of a cube containing on average one donor is @xmath172 .",
    "we simulate a silicon lattice cube of @xmath173 volume which contains on average 125 donors .",
    "since the donors are distributed uniformly , the number of donors in the cube is a poisson random variable with mean 125 .",
    "assuming one of the donors to be at the origin , in each iteration we generate a random number of dopants from a poisson process with mean 124 .",
    "the donors are placed according to a uniform distribution , randomly on the silicon lattice ( an fcc lattice with two point basis ( 000 ) , @xmath174(111 ) ; lattice constant @xmath175  @xcite ) .    for each donor configuration",
    ", we calculate @xmath2 couplings between the donor at the origin and all other donors .",
    "the expression for exchange coupling , given in the heitler - london formalism , is taken from ref .  .",
    "similar expressions taking into account the oscillatory dependence of @xmath2 coupling on donor - to - donor distance were also published in refs .  .",
    "the donor whose @xmath2 coupling is maximum is assumed to form a dimer pair with the donor at the origin .",
    "in addition , we take into account the possibility of forming trimers and higher order clusters .",
    "thus , we ignore the dimers where the second donor in the pair is more strongly coupled to a third donor .",
    "further , we ignore dimers in which either donor in the pair is coupled to a third donor with a @xmath2 greater than .",
    "the threshold was chosen since a coupling of this strength would result in a dimer esr signal splitting greater than the esr linewidth observed in our experiment . on average , for @xmath171 less than we found that less than of a million iterations were ignored , implying that that about of the donors form trimers or higher order clusters .",
    "the extremely broad range of @xmath2 values resulting from these calculations is best displayed by calculating the probability density of @xmath176 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : logjdistribution ] for a density of with @xmath2 coupling in dimers ranging from to .",
    "the calculated @xmath2 distribution is in agreement with the results in ref .  .",
