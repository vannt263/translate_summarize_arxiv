    "as we look ahead to the end of the coming decade , we will be entering the era of the extremely large telescopes ( elts ) .",
    "plans are well advanced for three elt projects with filled apertures well in excess of current optical - ir facilities : the giant magellan telescope ( gmt , with an equivalent diameter of 21.4 m ) , the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) and the 42 m european elt ( e - elt ) . when coupled with sophisticated adaptive optics ( ao ) systems to correct for atmospheric turbulence",
    ", the elts will provide us with unique views of stellar populations in the local volume .",
    "although planning a decade ahead may seem far removed , the lead - in times on these ambitious projects is more akin to those commonly associated with space missions , i.e. construction planning , detailed science simulations , conceptual instrument designs and the financial planning are all well advanced on all three elt projects .",
    "here we introduce the eagle phase a instrument study for the e - elt , highlighting its performance for observations of resolved stellar populations .",
    "photometric methods are immensely powerful when applied to extragalactic stellar populations , but only via precise chemical abundances and stellar kinematics can we break the age - metallicity degeneracy , while also disentangling the populations associated with different structures , i.e. follow - up spectroscopy is required . over the past decade",
    "the calcium triplet ( cat , spanning 0.85 - 0.87 @xmath1 m ) has become an increasingly used diagnostic of stellar metallicities and radial velocities in nearby galaxies , providing new views of their star - formation histories and sub - structure , e.g. the vlt - flames dart large programme @xcite .",
    "however , 8 - 10 m class telescopes are already at their limits in pursuit of cat spectra of the evolved populations in galaxies at distances greater than @xmath2300  kpc , e.g. keck - deimos observations in m31 struggled to yield useful signal - to - noise below the tip of the red giant branch at @xmath3  @xmath4  21.5 @xcite .    with its vast primary aperture and excellent angular resolution",
    ", the e - elt will be _ the _ facility to unlock spectroscopy of evolved stellar populations in the broad range of galaxies in the local volume , from the edge of the local group , out towards the virgo cluster .",
    "this will bring a wealth of new and exciting target galaxies within our grasp , spanning a broader range of galaxy morphologies , star - formation histories and metallicities than those available to us at present in the local group .",
    "these observations can then be used to confront theoretical models to provide a unique view of galaxy assembly and evolution .",
    "there are many compelling and ground - breaking targets for stellar spectroscopy with the e - elt including , in order of distance :    * ngc 3109 and sextans a with sub - smc metallicities ( @xmath5@xmath60.2@xmath7 ) , both at 1.3 mpc . * the spiral dominated sculptor ` group ' at 2 - 4 mpc .",
    "* the m83/ngc5128 ( centaurus a ) grouping at @xmath24 - 5 mpc . * ngc 3379 , the nearest normal elliptical at 10.8 mpc . * the virgo cluster of galaxies at 16 - 17 mpc , the nearest massive cluster .",
    "in contrast to proposed e - elt observations of high - redshift galaxies , targets for cat spectroscopy are readily available .",
    "for example , deep ground - based and _ hst _ imaging in galaxies in the local volume has begun to investigate their stellar populations @xcite , yet the stellar magnitudes are well beyond spectroscopy with existing facilities .",
    "note that although we have focussed mostly on southern - hemisphere targets here , there are equally compelling northern hemisphere targets , including the m81 group , and deeper studies in m31 and m33 .",
    "the eagle phase a study is a french - uk partnership to provide an advanced conceptual design of an ao - corrected , near - infrared spectrograph with multiple integral - field units ( ifus ) .",
    "the baseline design is summarised in table  1 , and has been shaped by five top - level science topics :    * physics and evolution of high - redshift galaxies * detection and characterisation of ` first light ' galaxies * galaxy assembly and evolution from stellar archaeology * star - formation , stellar clusters and the initial mass function * co - ordinated growth of black holes and galaxies    eagle will employ multi - object adaptive optics ( moao , @xcite to provide significantly improved image quality for selected target fields within the focal plane .",
    "this entails an array of six laser guide stars and five natural guide stars ( ngs ) to map the atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the deformable mirror in the telescope ( m4 ) will be used to correct for the low - order wavefront error terms , with the high - order terms corrected by deformable mirrors in each science channel .",
    "an integral part of the eagle project is the canary on - sky demonstrator on the william herschel telescope in la palma @xcite .",
    "the consortium has calculated moao point - spread functions ( psfs ) which take into account real ngs configurations , illustrative of relatively good and poor performance given the spatial distribution and magnitude of the available guide stars . in the following section we summarise eagle observations of resolved stellar populations beyond the local group , which would be used to probe the assembly history and chemical evolution of the host galaxies .",
    ".eagle baseline design .",
    "the patrol field is the instrument field - of - view within which ifus can be configured to observe individual targets . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "eagle provides a unique combination of abilities to harness the power of the e - elt for spectroscopy of resolved stellar populations .",
    "the image quality from moao will be significantly better than that obtained from seeing - limited or ground - layer ao modes , enabling us to explore spatially - resolved , extragalactic stars across a wide field of more than five arcminutes .",
    "a range of large programmes can be envisaged , each of which will help provide a fundamentally new view of stellar populations in the local universe ; from mapping of the sculptor galaxies , to deeper observations of the most luminous evolved stars in selected fields in galaxies at 10mpc and beyond .",
