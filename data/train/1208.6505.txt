    "currently the observational evidence coming from supernovae studies @xcite , cosmic background radiation fluctuations @xcite , and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , set a strong case for a cosmological ( concordance ) universe model composed by nearly @xmath1 percent of a mysterious component called dark energy , responsible for the current accelerated expansion , nearly @xmath2 percent of dark matter , which populates the galaxy halos and a small percentage ( around @xmath3 ) is composed by baryonic matter .",
    "the nature of these two dark component remains so far obscure @xcite . in the case of dark matter",
    ", we have a set of candidates to be probed with observations and detections in particle accelerators , however the case of dark energy is more elusive .",
    "this component not only has to fill the universe at the largest scale homogeneously , and also has the appropriate order of magnitude to be comparable to dark matter , but also has to have a negative pressure equation of state , something that was assumed first to explain inflation in the early universe , inspired by high energy theories of particle physics , but which seems to be awkward to appeal for , at these low energy scales .",
    "the alternative way to account for the cosmic acceleration , in the framework of the standard model , is to consider a modification of general relativity at large scales @xcite .",
    "some years ago , prigogine and co - workers @xcite presented a very interesting cosmological model where matter creation takes place without spoiling adiabatic expansion .",
    "this is possible by adding a work term due to the change of the particle number density @xmath4 .",
    "this work actually suggested for the first time , a way to incorporate the particle creation process in the context of cosmology in a self consistent way .",
    "in fact , the original claim made by zeldovich @xcite , that gravitational particle production can be described phenomenologically by a negative pressure , is realize here in a beautiful way .",
    "a covariant formulation of the model was presented for the first time in @xcite .",
    "originally , these considerations were applied in the context of ; the steady - state cosmological model , the warm inflationary scenario and within the standard inflationary scenario , during the reheating phase .",
    "based on this work , the studies of cosmological models with matter creation @xcite were initiated , and rapidly recognized to be potentially important to explain dark energy @xcite . in particular , in ref.@xcite the authors established a model where dark energy can be mimicked by self - interactions of the dark matter substratum . within the same framework ,",
    "models of interacting dark energy and dark matter were proposed @xcite . actually , in these studies is possible to have consistently , a universe where matter creation proceeds within an adiabatic evolution .",
    "more recently , lima et al.,@xcite have presented a study of a flat cosmological model where a transition from decelerated to accelerated phase exist .",
    "they explicitly show that previous models considered @xcite , does not exhibit the transition , and study the observational constraints on the model parameters .",
    "also in @xcite the authors modified slightly the model , adding explicitly a baryonic contribution , which enable them to have a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion always . in this work",
    "i consider the non flat extension of this matter creation cosmological model .",
    "this is important because , even in the @xmath0cdm concordance model , there is no clear evidence that @xmath5 is zero , due to the well known degeneracy between @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , any alternative model to dark energy then must consider a non flat assumption as a prior .",
    "this model enable us to explain the current acceleration of the universe expansion through a fictitious pressure component coming from changes in the dark matter particle number , without any exotic contribution .",
    "as a bonus , this model enable us to explain easily the cosmic coincidence problem ; it is not strange to have a similar contribution from these two ( commonly differently regarded ) components , because they are just two aspects of one and the same component ; the dark matter . in the next section",
    "i derive the equations of motion in the case of matter creation .",
    "then , in section iii i study the case for non flat models and the observational consequences in the models already knew .",
    "after this , i discuss a new particle creation model that resembles the @xmath0cdm model case , showing the transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion without enter in conflict with the behavior for large z.",
    "assuming that the particle number is not conserved @xmath7 , it leads to a modification of the energy conservation equation .",
    "in fact , assuming @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the particle creation rate , and using the frw metric we obtain the generalization of the energy conservation equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the enthalpy ( per unit volume ) , @xmath4 is the number density and @xmath12 is the energy density , and a new equation @xmath13 for the non conserved number density .",
    "the important thing to stress here is that the universe evolution continues to be adiabatic , in the sense that the entropy per particle remains unchanged ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the extra contribution can be interpreted in ( [ firstlaw ] ) as a non thermal pressure defined as @xmath15 this is the source that produces the acceleration of the universe expansion .",
    "once the particle number increases with the volume , we obtain a negative pressure . now , because we are considering matter creation , we have to impose the second law constraint @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the entropy density . from ( [ firstlaw ] )",
    "we find that the new set of einstein equations are @xmath18 @xmath19 and the previously derived relation ( [ ene ] ) .",
    "the set of equations ( [ ene ] ) , ( [ friedman ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) completely specified the system evolution .",
    "it is also useful to combine ( [ pc ] ) with ( [ friedman ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) to eliminate @xmath12 and obtain @xmath20 the standard adiabatic evolution is easily recovered : setting @xmath21 implies that @xmath22 , which leads to the usual conservation equation from ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "a class of de sitter solution is obtained with @xmath23 and arbitrary pressure @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , there exist another class of solutions where eq.([rho ] ) enable us to determine the pressure ; for example if @xmath25 , with @xmath26 constant , eq.([rho ] ) implies @xmath27 , and furthermore if @xmath28 and @xmath29 implies @xmath30 .",
    "i have to stress here that the main result derived in this section means that we have a single contribution , which satisfy the non - relativistic matter equation of state , that describe both dark matter and dark energy simultaneously , and in this way solves automatically the coincidence problem .",
    "this dark unification mechanism does not have the problem studied in @xcite , because in the cases studied in that paper , for example the chaplygin gas model @xcite , the sound velocity of the dark matter is not zero , leading to instabilities .",
    "that happens because the chaplygin gas interpolates between the equation of states for dark matter and dark energy .",
    "this does not happens here , because there is just one equation of state ; that of non - relativistic matter .",
    "in this section we study a number of models where matter creation produces cosmic acceleration , in a curved background .",
    "we also test the models using the most recent supernovae data , the so called union 2 set @xcite . in order to do",
    "that test we consider the comoving distance from the observer to redshift @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the snia data give the distance modulus @xmath34 which is related to the luminosity distance @xmath35 , through @xmath36 + 25 $ ] .",
    "we fit the snia with the cosmological model by minimizing the @xmath37 value defined by @xmath38 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\mu i}^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the corresponding observed one .",
    "let us assume first the particle creation rate evolving as @xmath41 where @xmath40 is a constant . from ( [ ene ] )",
    "we finds the solution for the density number @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant of integration . assuming @xmath25 as for non - relativistic matter ( that leads to que usual equation of state @xmath27 as we discussed that at the end of the last section )",
    ", we get for the hubble function @xmath44 clearly , this model does not describe properly a transition from decelerated to an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "in fact , from ( [ friedman ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) we obtain : @xmath45 depending on the value assumed for @xmath40 we obtain a model that accelerate forever ( @xmath46 ) or decelerate forever ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "+    a bayesian analysis using the union 2 data set of snia @xcite enable us to plot confidence contours for the two parameters of the model : @xmath40 and @xmath48 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig02 ] .",
    "clearly , the data suggest a large negative value for the curvature parameter , indicating that in order to fit the snia data , the function @xmath49 has to have a very distorted form . in any case , because this model does not present a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase , it can be ruled out immediately .",
    "as is well known from observations of supernovae , a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion occurs in the recent history of the universe .",
    "depending on what is used to model dark energy , different redshift have been obtained between @xmath51 to @xmath52 . in the context of a model of adiabatic matter creation , this topic was recently discussed in @xcite where the authors specialized in a flat cosmology , where a explicit transition can be achieved from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion using the following model @xmath53 in this section we generalize this work to non flat universes . in what follows , a non relativistic matter equation of state",
    "is assumed @xmath54 ( @xmath27 ) . introducing ( [ rate12 ] ) in ( [ ene ] )",
    "leads to the following solution    @xmath55    is evident the meaning of the subscript zero . because @xmath54 for non - relativistic matter and using ( [ eq5 ] ) we obtain    @xmath56    that clearly allow us to describe an acceleration / deceleration transition .",
    "writing the right hand side in terms of @xmath57 and using the hubble equation once more , we can write    @xmath58    for @xmath59 this equation coincides with that in @xcite , for which an explicit form of @xmath49 was found . in the general case ,",
    "@xmath60 , it is not possible to integrate ( [ heqt ] ) to obtain a closed analytic form . instead",
    ", we use @xmath61 to change the time derivatives for derivatives of the scale factor @xmath62 , and using that @xmath63 , change again the derivatives in terms of the redshift .",
    "doing that , we obtain    @xmath64\\left(\\frac{3\\gamma}{2e}-\\frac{1}{2 } \\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 .",
    "given the set of parameters @xmath48 and @xmath50 , we integrate numerically ( [ edez ] ) to obtain the function @xmath66 .",
    "+    a bayesian analysis using the union 2 data set of snia @xcite enable us to plot confidence contours for the two parameters of the model : @xmath50 and @xmath48 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig03 ] . again , as in the previous subsection , the snia data suggest a very large negative value for @xmath48 .",
    "a simple way to understand the large negative values obtained for @xmath48 in the fitting process , which is suggested by the snia data in these models , is by plotting the @xmath49 function in the range @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ hzf ] we display such a plot .",
    "+    all the three models have two free parameters to be fixed with the snia data .",
    "although at low redshift ( @xmath68 ) the three curves coincide , their evolution with increasing @xmath31 differs appreciably .",
    "clearly the @xmath40 model behaves erroneously .",
    "instead , the @xmath50 model , although it has the correct tendency , it is easily differentiated from the lcdm at large redshift ( @xmath69 ) . because we are using the snia data set , the best fit values for the free parameters in these models ( shown in fig.[hzf ] ) adjust principally the low-@xmath31 zone , because from the @xmath70 snia data only @xmath71 have @xmath72 .",
    "this is also clear once we try to perform a joint bayesian analysis using snia plus the bao and cmb constraints ( see table i ) . using the @xmath40 model",
    ", the procedure even does not find any appropriate configuration .",
    "using the @xmath50 model , it is possible to get a good fit ( @xmath73 ) using only snia+bao , however once we add the cmb constraint , it worsens the fit ( @xmath74 ) .",
    ".[tab : table0 ] the @xmath37 for the best fit values in models discussed in this section plus the curved @xmath0cdm using the union2 data set in the case of a non flat universe model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is therefore clear why in @xcite the authors add an explicit contribution for baryons .",
    "adding baryonic dark matter with @xmath75 in the previous models , enable us to obtain better best fit parameters for the models that , for instance modifying fig .",
    "[ hzf ] into fig .",
    "[ hzf2 ] .",
    "+    for example , in the case of the @xmath50 model , once we add baryons the best fit parameters improve respect to the case without baryons ; using only snia+bao we get a @xmath76 , however once we add the cmb constraint , it worsens the fit again .",
    "the previous models have been discussed in several papers , deriving their consequences in cosmological evolution and also testing their performance to fit the supernova data .",
    "the problem with the @xmath40 model is that it can not describe properly a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath50 model can do this , however they can only fit well low - redshift observational constraint ( snia data with @xmath68 ) . as we mentioned in the last section , if we attempt to include the bao and cmb constraint , the whole fit breaks down .",
    "the objective merit of this type of model is that we can mimic a cosmological constant without use of an exotic component , we just need to assume the existence of matter creation that takes place with a certain rate . in principle",
    ", we do not have any fundamental reason to use a specific form of the matter creation rate .",
    "the only fundamental feature we have to respect is the second law of thermodynamics ( [ second ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we propose a model that was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider this model here as an example .",
    "this model is characterized by the following matter creation rate @xmath77 which for @xmath78 satisfy the requirement , because @xmath49 is a positive definite function . inserting in ( [ ene ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath79 that resembles the combined contribution of a cosmological constant and dust .",
    "the level of fine tuning here to obtain an accelerated expansion is relatively smaller than in the usual @xmath0cdm model , because in this case , both terms come from the same function , and we know that we can obtain an accelerated expansion phase after some period of time from ( [ friedman ] ) .",
    "in fact , from ( [ pc ] ) we get @xmath80 , so replacing in ( [ eq5 ] ) we find @xmath81.\\ ] ] note however that the equation of state has not been modified , @xmath12 is still the non - relativistic contribution .",
    "we do not have to introduce any exotic component - with a negative pressure - to describe the current expansion acceleration .",
    "given the current status of the dark matter and dark energy problem @xcite , we can use this idea as a possible way to understand it . replacing in the hubble equation",
    "we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which is effectively indistinguishable from a curved lcdm model . because @xmath85 , is clear that the observations implies a positive @xmath86 for this new model .    in this work",
    "i have studied a model which considering small changes in the total number of particles in our universe , offer a possible way to understand the current accelerated expansion measurements , without using any exotic energy component . also , this scenario alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem , basically showing that these two components , dark matter and dark energy , are of the same nature , but their act at different scales .",
    "this way of understand the snia observations , implies that cosmology have a new window to explore the universe considering matter creation , encoded in the function @xmath87 .",
    "i have discussed the two models already known in the literature , extending the analysis to nonflat universes , performing a bayesian analysis using both snia and also bao and cmb .",
    "i have found that , both the @xmath40 and @xmath50 models fail to fit the observations , even considering @xmath88 . although adding an explicit baryonic dark matter contribution may ameliorate the fit using snia+bao in the @xmath50 model , adding the cmb constraint worsens the situation .",
    "the statistical analysis was performed even in the case an explicit form for @xmath49 was lacking .",
    "i have also studied a previously proposed new model , through a specific form of the matter creation rate , which is almost indistinguishable from a lcdm model , which enable us to fit all the observations , snia+bao+cmb .",
    "although similar to lcdm , the model can be distinguished through the structure formation process , which will be studied elsewhere .",
