    "the discovery of a galaxy hosting a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) was achieved for the first time in february 1997 , with the identification of an afterglow , the event grb970228 ( costa et al1997 ) .",
    "however , its redshift , @xmath4 , was measured later from the detection of emission lines in the host through keck spectroscopy ( djorgovski , et al.1999 ) .",
    "the very first gamma - ray burst redshift was measured in may 1997 , for grb970508 .",
    "the absorption lines seen in the keck spectrum of the optical afterglow gave @xmath5 ( metzger et al.1997 ) . today",
    ", precise localization of afterglows ( 2 arcsecs or better ) is routinely performed , at the level of several events per week , mainly thanks to the data collected with the most successful dedicated space mission , the nasa satellite _ swift _ , launched at the end of 2004 ( gehrels et al.2004 ) . since 1997 , and as of the first half of 2015 , gamma - ray instruments identified a total of more than 1,400 grbs .",
    "although @xmath6% of _ swift _ grbs are localized , thanks to the x - ray instrument xrt , the afterglow localization for the whole population since 1997 was possible for only about half them .",
    "these are mainly long grbs ( more than 90% ) , those for which the gamma - ray emission is longer than a couple of seconds , and associated with the death of a massive star ( mass of the progenitor @xmath7 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the hosts are detected mainly for the long grbs .",
    "[ f1 ]    fruchter et al.(2006 ) investigated the location where the grb takes place and found that those at @xmath8 prefer the most active regions in the galaxy , more than what done by core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sne ) . following this early result , kelly et al.(2008 ) found that grb environments are more similar to those of sn type ic rather than sn type ii .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that spectroscopically confirmed sne found a couple of weeks after the grb are type ic ( see hjorth & bloom 2012 ; for a review ) .",
    "sn ic s tend to be more luminous than the typical cc - sne .",
    "studies of the sn - grb connection is limited basically to @xmath9 , where sn can spectroscopically be identified .    at higher redshift",
    ", it has been finally found that the role of dust is important .",
    "the tough sample includes a complete investigation of 69 grb hosts ( median redshift @xmath10 ) .",
    "hjorth et al.(20112 ) indicate that optically dark grbs tend to occur in more massive and redder galaxies with respect to optically detected grbs .",
    "the presence of large dust content was found in dark grbs though radio and deep observations .",
    "the large sample shoals studied by perley et al.(2015a , b ) with multi - band optical - ir observations of 119 hosts revealed a relatively large fraction ( 20% ) of dust obscured galaxies , which are also massive systems .",
    "radio observations ( michaowski et al.2012 ; perley & perley 2013 ) have revealed that some have properties similar to sub - millimeter galaxies , but the majority does not have hidden high dust obscured star - formation rate ( sfr ) .    despite the numerous surveys which used with different means and selection criteria , we are still not sure how well grb hosts represent the whole galaxy population .",
    "for instance , contradictory results are found on the galaxy luminosity function . using the though sample , schulze et al.(2015 )",
    "compared the grb - host luminosity function to the one of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and concluded that grbs select metal poor galaxies .",
    "this was not confirmed by the high - redshift @xmath11 sample studied by greiner et al.(2015 ) .    since the beginning",
    ", it was pursued the idea that grbs prefer low - metallicity environments ( e.g. , graham & fruchter 2013 ; vergani et al2014 ; and references therein ) . from the theoretical and modelling point of view",
    ", this conclusion was reached at low ( niino et al.2011 ; boissier et al.2013 ; vergani et al.2014 ) and high redshift ( chisari et al.2010 ; trenti et al.2015 ) .",
    "however , see the work by campisi et al.(2011 ) and elliott et al.(2012 ) for a different conclusion .",
    "this shows that we are still far from a full comprehension and interpretation of the galaxy population hosting grbs .",
    "contrary to what is commonly believed , our main limitation is not the observational bias , but the small number statistics . since the first afterglow in 1997",
    ", the number of detected hosts with spectroscopic redshift is only 1/4 ( 374 ) of the total number of identified afterglows .",
    "the majority are long grbs ( 351 ) , 23 are short .",
    "eighteen years after the first afterglow localization , we are still dealing with a small number statistics .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that grbs are distributed over the entire redshift interval ever explored in the history of human kind ( fig.[f1 ] ) , from @xmath12 ( grb980425 at 37 mpc from the milky way ; galama et al.1998 ) to @xmath13 ( grb090423 ; salvaterra et al.2009 ; tanvir et al.2009a ) , makes them the most valuable resources of exploration of the dawn of the universe .",
    "the definition of the population of galaxies hosting grbs is not precisely defined . when an optical afterglow is detected and a spectrum is obtained , it is often possible to measure the redshift from the identification of absorption lines , for instance the strong mgii@xmath14 doublet ( in the optical for the wide redshift interval @xmath15 ) .",
    "we automatically assume that these absorption features are associated with the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy , thus implicitly conclude that the host is identified .",
    "however , when we talk about the properties of the host galaxy population as a whole , we generally refer to the detected stellar and gas emission of the galaxy which lies closest to the afterglow . by doing this",
    ", we not always give the proper emphasis to the results obtained from absorption line studies , because the direct identification of the galaxy is not always possible .",
    "our view becomes more incomplete at @xmath16 , where galaxies become increasingly fainter . as a consequence ,",
    "the grb host population we generally discuss includes basically galaxies detected in emission , photometrically and spectroscopically , mainly at @xmath17 , spanning about 2/3 of the entire history of the universe .",
    "what about the grb hosts during the first 4.3 gyr of life ?",
    "[ f2 ] = 8.5 cm    for only less than half of all grbs with measured redshift ( 160 ) imaging has shown the presence of a galaxy .",
    "multi - band photometry from optical to the near infrared ( nir ) at low redshift is sufficient to derive with good accuracy the stellar mass of the galaxy . of this population , another half or so are those with one ( or more ) emission lines detected , typically the strong [ oii]@xmath18 feature ,",
    "more easily detected ( in the optical / nir ) when @xmath19 .",
    "emission lines provide a direct measurement of sfr , the most known parameter .",
    "if , together with the oxygen , one balmer line is detected , then the metallicity can be estimated .",
    "this can be h@xmath20 for @xmath21 , otherwise h@xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "at the moment , for at most 30 galaxies it was possible to determine the metallicity .",
    "when h@xmath22 and h@xmath20 are detected together , the line ratio ( balmer decrement ) gives the dust extinction in the optical @xmath24 ( about 22 hosts ) .",
    "these samples are small , but we can improve the statistics by considering gas properties from absorption lines .    at high redshift , grb afterglow spectroscopy provides independent measurements of the metallicity ( at least 26 grb hosts ) .",
    "this is possible exclusively for @xmath25 , when the lyman-@xmath22 absorption line ( necessary to measure the hi column density ) is redshifted to the optical window .",
    "this redshift limit is set by the fact that the only suitable uv spectrograph , on hubble space telescope , is not used to observe grb afterglows .",
    "if hi is not detected , low - ionization lines , associated with heavy elements in the neutral ism , are used to derive relative abundances .",
    "for instance , the zinc - to - iron or silicon - to - iron ratio are directly connected to the amount of dust depletion , therefore , to the dust column distributed along the sight line in the host .",
    "the overlap between these different samples is still very limited . for only a very few individual grbs it was possible to detect the afterglow and study absorption lines , together with the host in imaging , and also perform the spectroscopy for the emission lines , therefore ,",
    "derive in principle the maximum number of galaxy parameters .",
    "however , soon the heavy use of the optical - nir spectrograph x - shooter ( at the very large telescope ) for grb programs will deliver first results on relatively large numbers are in the process of being published ( krhler et al.2015 ) ] , which will allow the exploration of an unknown territory , in a way that even normal galaxy surveys can not do .",
    "we have to emphasize that the scientific community dealing with grbs can not really be accused of being lazy for not publishing data and results .",
    "an interesting statistics is the number of papers where the information on grb host galaxies is reported : more or less 450 are the papers from which information for about 250 grb hosts are reported . yet , our understanding of this galaxy population is effected by the small number statistics .",
    "the difference with normal galaxy surveys , that count many thousands of galaxies , is apparent .",
    "for instance , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , 15 years after the beginning of the project includes photometry and spectroscopy for a sample of half a billion galaxies .",
    "[ f3 ]    for a long time and still today , the scientific community has adopted the idea that the typical grb host galaxy is a small star - forming metal poor galaxy with low dust content ( e.g. , levesque et al.2010a ; graham & fruchter 2013 ; vergani et al.2014 ) .",
    "for instance , a typical host is the one of grb011121 ( bloom et al.2002 ; kpc yolda et al.2007 ) , among the first ever studied in detail .",
    "the galaxy is at low - redshift ( @xmath26 ) , small ( stellar mass @xmath27 m@xmath2 ) , with low metallicity @xmath28 and low dust extinction ( @xmath29 ) , but , given its mass , a relatively high sfr@xmath30 m@xmath2 yr@xmath31 . the initial view , according to which the host of a grb , whose progenitor is a massive and metal poor star , is special and does not represent the general galaxy population , has been hard to change .",
    "these common properties , derived at low redshift , can naturally be explained if we consider that galaxies are easier to observe and study if they are close , at @xmath21 , where faint targets can be detected , emission lines measured in the optical , and dust extinction , sfr and metallicity estimated . at this low redshift ,",
    "the most common star forming galaxy is small .",
    "high star formation activity is the necessary ingredient to have a high chance of a massive - star explosion .",
    "small galaxies are typically metal and dust poor .",
    "the natural consequence is that the host galaxy of a low-@xmath3 grb is a small galaxy which is also metal and dust poor . however , extrapolating this idea to any redshift is itself a bias .",
    "instead , it should be more natural to think that grbs at high redshift happen in galaxies different from does at low redshift , because the universe back then was very different",
    ".    it would take too long to describe the large variety of properties seen lately in grb host galaxies .",
    "we report a few examples .",
    "for instance , the two cases seen in fig.[f2 ] , where the two afterglow spectra for grb090926a at @xmath32 ( rau et al.2010 ) and grb090323 at @xmath33 ( savaglio et al.2012 ) are compared .",
    "their metallicity are at two extremes : the former is about 1/100 the solar value ( large hi absorption and the weak metal lines ) , the latter is over solar ( strong metal lines and relatively low hi absorption ) .",
    "it is remarkable in the latter that a high chemical enrichment is measured in a galaxy when the universe was less than 2 gyr old .",
    "unfortunately the host is detected , but its mass is not known .",
    "since the first grb redshift measurement in 1997 , many scientists inside and out the grb community have learned that galaxies hosting grbs do not represent the whole galaxy population .",
    "it is believed that grbs are special and rare events and their hosts are observational biased . moreover",
    ", theoretical models predict that , for a grb to occur , a jet of relativistic particles has to break from the star collapsing core .",
    "the gamma - ray radiation has to emerge from inside and stay collimated , because if the emission were isotropic , it would be too large ( equivalent to the rest - mass energy of the star ) .",
    "the collimation is preserved by the high angular momentum , which is possible if radiation pressure ( less efficient in a low - metallicity star ) is low , and the mass loss as well .",
    "therefore , it is easier to imagine that the grb ambient is chemically pristine .",
    "however , it is strange that the dozen spectroscopically identified sne , seen within 2 weeks after the grb ( mainly @xmath23 ) , are type ic : no hydrogen nor helium , but silicon .",
    "these features are explained by mass loss of the external envelope , through stellar wind ( like in wolfe - rayet stars ) or by the presence of a companion in a binary system .    from one side ,",
    "this issue is fundamental and still highly debated . from the other , it was clear since the beginning of the first redshift that there was something special about the host galaxies",
    ". they looked different , although not necessarily unique , from the observational point of view .",
    "it looked like we had missed these galaxies while using the traditional approach : observational campaigns start from optically bright targets .",
    "with grbs , we can in principle overcome this limitation : grbs are bright in the gamma - ray and short , and pinpoint to locations in galaxies regardless of their brightness .",
    "it is hard to imagine a less biased way of selecting galaxies .",
    "the main problem of this population right now is , as said above , the small number statistics , and not the way ( still vaguely understood ) grbs select galaxies .",
    "the grb host population suffers of some kind of bias , but not more than any other galaxy population we can think of .",
    "any galaxy population is detected with specific tools and using some selection criteria , and by definition any survey is biased .",
    "observational biases are corrected by using well tested and complex analysis methods , but this is done by assuming that we have full control of the observational tools ( possible ) and have an idea ( up front ) of what we are missing .",
    "grb hosts are selected in a very different way , and this , by itself , can only be good because it tackles the problem of galaxy search from a different point of view .",
    "being different is not a good reason for discarding them when studying galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this would introduce a bias , and there is no scientific justification to do so .",
    "grb host galaxies have an important value for our understanding of galaxies at any epoch . in the 450 papers mentioned above ,",
    "a large variety of telescopes , wavelength bands , instruments , depths and analysis methods are used .",
    "thus , very different are the properties that we found , which is by itself an indication that , given the small number statistics , there can not be a typical grb host galaxy .",
    "the most common comments the grb community faces when applying for telescope time is that `` the sample is too small '' or `` biased and does not represent the galaxy population '' .",
    "this is not always a good justification : we have achieved many fundamental discoveries from a small sample , adding one or a few more objects is important in any case .",
    "[ f5 ] = 9.9 cm",
    "there can not be a typical grb host simply because grbs are seen from @xmath34 to the highest ever measured redshift @xmath35 , when the first collapsed objects formed . over this time",
    ", the universe has dramatically changed .",
    "not surprising if grb hosts did as well .",
    "it is widely accepted that the universe was much more active in the past , as clearly seen from the redshift evolution of the star - formation rate density ( sfrd ) .",
    "fig.[f1 ] shows the history of the sfrd , characterized by a beginning , a steady / intermediate state , and a decaying era .",
    "our knowledge is much more accurate for the last 8 gyr ( @xmath9 ) , when the sfrd dropped by at least a factor of 10 .",
    "this is the universe where half of all grb hosts are detected and from where most of our knowledge comes from .    at higher redshift",
    ", hosts are harder to see in emission because they are fainter , but the grb can overcome this limitation .",
    "afterglow spectra reveal absorption lines associated with the ism in the host .",
    "column densities of the gas are often large , and the absorbers are classified as damped lyman-@xmath22 systems ( dlas ) . in these cases",
    "the gas is mainly neutral , the ionization correction can be neglected and the metallicity can easily be derived .",
    "this was done for grbs in the interval @xmath36 . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the redshift is measured for 27 grbs from the afterglow ( fig.[f1 ] ) , but not much luck for the direct detection of the host : only 4 have been seen , in the rest - frame uv , and none at @xmath38 ( where 10 are the total number of grb redshifts ) .",
    "grb - dlas have often a large column density of hi . of the 62 grb - dlas with a measured @xmath39@xmath40 , 53 ( 85.5% ) have @xmath41@xmath40 , and 13 ( 21% ) have @xmath42@xmath40 .",
    "the largest value ever measured ( @xmath43@xmath40 ) was found in grb080607 at @xmath44 ( prochaska et al.2009 ) .",
    "for comparison , the fraction of dlas with @xmath41@xmath40 found along qso sight lines is 5.4% only .",
    "this is one of the most striking differences between what has been known for decades about the ism in high-@xmath3 galaxies and what is now observed with grb spectroscopy .",
    "[ f6 ]    another science topic where grb investigations revealed interesting results is the molecular gas .",
    "the low fraction of molecular hydrogen in qso - dlas is a well known phenomenon .",
    "fig.3 shows the h@xmath45 column densities measured in local environments ( the milky way and magellanic clouds , savage et al.1977 ; tumlinson et al.2002 ) , and in qso - dlas .",
    "many are the low values and upper limits in the former population .",
    "the investigation of molecular hydrogen was possible only though a very limited number of grb afterglows , eight in total , and half of them led to a positive detection .",
    "remarkable is the relatively high fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath46 \\sim -1.14 $ ] found in grb080607 at @xmath44 with the extreme column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath47 ( prochaska et al.2009 ) .    with a better statistics , available in the last few years , many are the grb hosts revealing unexpected ( according to the common belief ) properties .",
    "a few have high molecular gas content ( see above ) , others are massive , many have a large amount of dust and dust extinction .",
    "the dust extinction is easily estimated by assuming that the intrinsic emission is a simple or broken power law , and fitting the observed sed of the afterglow in nir , optical , uv and x - ray . in fig.4 , the optical extinctions @xmath24 in grb afterglows",
    "is shown together with the estimated average ( plus dispersion ) @xmath24 in qso - dlas . in the latter ,",
    "@xmath24 is estimated by considering that the dust depletion , represented by the zinc - to - iron relative abundance , gives the dust content along the sight line , thus , the dust extinction ( savaglio 2006 ) .",
    "the figure shows that grbs probe dustier environments than qso - dlas .",
    "the presence of dust is also manifested by the uv bump , the broad absorption feature centered at @xmath48  .",
    "prominent in the milky way , it is much weaker in the lmc and absent in the smc .",
    "its origin is still not totally known : graphites and silicates , mixed with complex molecules ? the uv bump is not easily detected outside local environments . in qso - dlas , it is generally very weak and can be seen only from composite spectra ( see ledoux et al2015 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "a strong uv bump is seen in several grb afterglow spectra .",
    "for instance , prochaska et al(2009 ) detected it in grb080607 at @xmath49 , from which @xmath50 was derived .",
    "in the same spectrum , a large hi column density and molecular absorption is measured as well ( see section [ s4 ] ) .",
    "the host of this dark grb was widely investigated from the uv to the infrared , and a relatively high stellar mass is derived , @xmath51 m@xmath2 ( perley et al.2013 ) .",
    "this is another host which , according to the canonical view , can be considered abnormal. more recently , an unusually strong uv bump is identified in grb140506 at @xmath52 .",
    "the best - fit model gives an extreme @xmath24 ( fynbo et al.2014 ) .",
    "in general , the presence of the uv bump is also demonstrated from multi - band photometry and sed fitting of the afterglow .",

    "the sfr limit for the host of grb090423 indicates that a very low stellar mass , @xmath99 m@xmath2 , is possible if @xmath70sfr @xmath100 gyr@xmath31 .",
    "vice versa , if we assume @xmath70sfr @xmath101 gyr@xmath31 , the limit sfr @xmath94 m@xmath2yr@xmath31 gives @xmath102 m@xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that in the past , grb hosts must have been very small .",
    "how about if a fraction of grbs at high redshift happened in young progenitors of today s globular clusters ?",
    "if so , finding a host like that might still be out of present telescope capabilities .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[f8 ] shows a beautiful hst image of a well known globular cluster ( gc ) : messier 80 ( m80 ) . due to its intrinsic brightness ( absolute magnitude @xmath103 ) and proximity to the sun ( 10 kpc ) ,",
    "this is one of the most studied gcs ever .",
    "m80 is characterized by the usual properties for gcs : old ( 12.5 gyr ) , metal poor ( @xmath104 ) , compact , with a high stellar density , and is also relatively massive ( @xmath105 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "if we believe that the universe today is 13.7 gyr old , m80 must have formed when the universe was 1.2 gyr old .",
    "that means that grbs at @xmath106 would be contemporary to the newly born m80 . however , one main problem of a proto - gc as a possible host of high-@xmath3 grbs is the small fraction of stellar mass contained in gcs with respect to the total stellar mass in galaxies .",
    "less than 200 are the known gcs in the mw . if we assume they all have a mass similar to m80 ( which is a massive gc ) and that the stellar mass of the mw is @xmath107 m@xmath2 , the fraction of stellar mass in gcs with respect to the total can not be higher than @xmath108% , very low .",
    "[ f8 ]    = 5.8 cm    however , the picture can not be discarded too quickly .",
    "young proto - gcs must have had very different properties , perhaps similar to a young massive star cluster today .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that intense star formation in starbursts create the physical conditions to form numerous and massive star clusters ( e.g. , adamo et al.2011 ) .",
    "finally , hydrodynamical simulations have shown that galaxy collision has a role in the formation of massive star clusters ( renaud et al.2015 ) , which eventually will evolve in gcs . as mentioned in section 6 , interactions and mergers",
    "are common in high-@xmath3 grbs .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[f8 ] shows the recently discovered massive star cluster r136 , in the star - forming region 30 doradus of the lmc ( crowthler et al.2010 ) .",
    "this star cluster is young ( a few myr old ) , and as massive as m80 .",
    "what is interesting from the point of view of grbs is that r136 contains a high concentration of massive stars , over 70 o and wolfe - rayet stars within 5 pc .",
    "equally important , conroy ( 2012 ) found indications that the initial mass of gcs were at least @xmath109 times larger than today , easily exceeding @xmath110 m@xmath2 .",
    "mass loss is due to stellar winds , shocks and sn events .",
    "moreover , a certain number of gcs in the mw might have disappeared early on , being gravitationally unbound within 1 gyr ( vesperini et al.2009 ) , or disrupted during the merging of proto - galaxies .    from the galaxy point of view , it has been known for a decade now that a large fraction of the cosmic stellar mass was produced at @xmath111 , when the universe was almost half of its present age . in a recent review article , madau & dickinson ( 2014 ) show that the stellar - mass density from @xmath112 to now has increased by a factor of @xmath113 ( fig.9 ) .",
    "a galaxy like the mw was still in the process of forming at @xmath112 , very likely the main body of its mass ( for instance , the disk ) was not in place jet , whereas likely a proto - bulge was . however , a large fraction of the proto - gcs , those that today are older than 12.5 gyr were already formed or on the process of forming , some will never survive for long , suffering from the disruptive gravitational force of the mw .    all together , this means that the initial fraction of stars in proto - gcs must have been much larger than the 0.25% fraction of today .",
    "we quantify under which circumstances , at @xmath112 , the total mass in proto - gcs would be about the mass of the proto - mw . if we assume that : @xmath114 proto - gcs were 10 times more massive , which means @xmath115proto - gc@xmath116 m@xmath2 @xmath117 the total number of proto - gcs was lower than today because many formed at @xmath118 ; @xmath119 but this is compensated by assuming that many first generation proto - gcs did not survive until today ; @xmath120 the stellar mass of the mw was 40 times lower , e.g. , @xmath115proto - mw@xmath121 m@xmath2 , then all these conditions together give a ratio of stellar mass in proto - gcs to the one of the proto - mw @xmath122proto - gcs@xmath123proto - mw@xmath124 .",
    "stars in proto - gcs and the proto - mw are equally important .",
    "another last situation in favor of proto - gcs as hosts of high-@xmath3 grbs is that they have a high density of binary systems .",
    "massive and rapidly rotating binary systems are expected to be very common in a low - metallicity environment ( sana et al . , 2012 ) and such a configuration",
    "is considered to be very favorable for high - redshift grbs ( bromm & loeb(2006 ) . for the description of the formation of fast - rotating massive stars in a possible scenario of proto - gcs ,",
    "see krause et al.(2013 ) .    in fig.10",
    ", we show this possible scenario , with a grb happening in a proto - gc at @xmath112 . on top an optical image of the andromeda galaxy . in the center a uv image of the same galaxy , with artificially overlaid many gcs like m80 . at the bottom",
    ", we imagine that at @xmath112 , only the bulge of such a giant spiral galaxy was in place , the uv part in the disk with young stars today would form later , while all gcs were already there .",
    "in the same image , a grb has exploded inside a gc .",
    "[ f9 ]    [ f10 ] = 5.5 cm",
    "the impact of grb host galaxies on the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is still affected by small number statistics . their knowledge is mainly limited to the @xmath17 regime , where about half of the galaxies hosting grbs have been found and studied in detail . from this ,",
    "the most accepted picture is that grb hosts are generally small , star forming and metal and dust poor objects .",
    "however , at @xmath16 , metallicity , mass and dust extinction show a large spread , suggesting a different population .",
    "many host galaxies show disturbed morphologies , interactions with nearby galaxies and mergers .",
    "all this is nicely connected to the idea that local massive ellipticals today were young and bursty in the past , with some of them experiencing close encounters with other galaxies , which likely triggered intense episodes of star formation .    at very high redshift , @xmath88",
    ", the situation might have changed again .",
    "massive galaxies were very rare , but these are observationally easier to find .",
    "in fact , at these distances , deep searches failed to detected any grb host , and relatively low sfrs were inferred . unless dust content was already important back then ( unlikely )",
    ", low sfrs means low galaxy mass .",
    "therefore , grb hosts in the past could have been more similar to the local counterparts .",
    "this is supported by recent findings according to which the uv flux that ionized the universe at high redshift was produced by very small , young and star forming galaxies ( bouwens et al.2015 ) .    as an alternative picture",
    ", we propose a different paradigm , never considered in detail , according to which a proto globular cluster , which would look like a massive young star cluster in the local universe , could host high-@xmath3 grbs .",
    "globular clusters today contain a very low fraction of the total stellar mass , but at @xmath88 proto - gcs can be equally important in terms of stellar mass because many lost a large fraction of the mass in subsequent encounters with more massive galaxies .",
    "moreover , giant galaxies like the mw have formed a large fraction of their present stellar mass in recent times . in support of this idea",
    "is the fact that proto - gcs probably contains a large fraction of massive and rapidly rotating binary systems , also a favorable situation for grbs .    in summary ,",
    "grb hosts @xmath125 are generally small galaxies , whereas at intermediate redshift an important fraction of hosts are massive , dusty or metal rich galaxies .",
    "going further in the past , in the primordial universe , host galaxies are again likely very small systems , so small that , perhaps , these systems are massive young star clusters with a large fraction of massive and rotating binary systems , possible seeds of grbs .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers for the kind invitation , and the referee for comments and suggestions which stimulated a more detailed discussion about gcs as possible high-@xmath3 grb hosts .",
    "i express my appreciation to enzo brocato for sharing his knowledge of globular clusters and the young star cluster r136 .",
