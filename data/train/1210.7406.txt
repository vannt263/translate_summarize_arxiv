    "wannier - stark states ( ws - states ) are eigenstates of quantum particle in a tilted lattice . strictly speaking ws - states are resonances and have complex energies .",
    "however , for weak static fields they can be approximated by the stationary states with real energies ( the single - band or tight - binding approximations ) . in the past two decades ws - states and related problems of bloch oscillations ( bo ) and",
    "interband landau - zenner tunneling ( lz - tunneling ) were readdressed in a number of fascinating laboratory experiments with cold atoms in ( quasi ) 1d optical lattices and the light in 1d arrays of optical waveguides , see refs .",

    "these experiments stimulated theoretical studies that resulted in essential progress in the theory of ws - states in one - dimentional systems , see ref .",

    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmed later on in the experiment @xcite that ws - states in a 2d lattice are sensitive to the direction of the static field relative to primary axes of the lattice .",
    "unfortunately , for square lattices considered in the above cited papers this effect is well pronounced only in the strong - field regime , where metastable nature of ws - states plays major role . in the present work we analyze ws - states and",
    "bo for a quantum particle in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "we will show that for this lattice the non - analitic angular dependence of ws - states is seen already in the weak - field regime , where the metastable ws - states can be approximated by the stationary states .",
    "this feature of the stationary ` honeycomb ' ws - states has direct consequences for bloch dynamics of the system that becomes qualitatively different for rational and irrational field directions defined later on in the text .",
    "it should be mentioned that bo in the honeycomb lattice were addressed earlier with respect to conductivity of graphene nano - ribbons @xcite . however , in these works the electric field was aligned with the ribbon axis and , thus , the alignment effects were not discussed .",
    "this paper consists of two parts devoted to analytical and numerical analysis of ws - states , sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , and bo of a quantum particle in the honeycomb lattices , sec .",
    "the main results of the work are summarized in sec .",
    "in the standard presentation with two sublattices the tight - binding hamiltonian of a quantum particle in the honeycomb lattice reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath2 denote coordinates of a - sites , and @xmath3 are three vectors that point from a a - site to the nearest b - sites .",
    "if a static field is present , this hamiltonian should be complimented with the stark term , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the field vector and @xmath2 and @xmath6 are coordinates of the a- and b - sites , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e. , in the stationary honeycomb ws - states .",
    "we begin with recalling general result concerning the structure of ws - states in a two - dimensional lattice of arbitrary geometry : for the field @xmath5 parallel to a vector pointing from one lattice site to any other site ws - states are extended states in the direction orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "these field directions can be labeled by two co - prime numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 and for this reason are turmed rational directions .",
    "for example , for the square lattice the rational directions are given by @xmath9 or @xmath10 while for the honeycomb lattice these are @xmath11 the spectrum of ws - states for a rational direction @xmath12 consists of infinite number of equally spaced energy bands .",
    "a particular feature of the square lattice and other simple lattices ( like , for example , a triangular lattice with the hexagonal symmetry @xcite ) is that these energy bands are flat for almost all rational directions .",
    "because of this feature there is no qualitative difference between rational and irrational directions for the square lattice in the tight - binding approximation . in what follows",
    "we show that the wannier - stark energy bands of the honeycomb lattice have finite widths already in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "this makes a crucial difference between the honeycomb lattice and the square or triangular lattices , as well as between rational and irrational directions for the honeycomb lattice .      for the rational directions",
    "ws - states in the honeycomb lattice are labeled by the ladder number @xmath13 , the transverse quasimomentum @xmath14 , and the sublattice index @xmath15 .",
    "correspondently , the energy spectrum is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a periodic function of @xmath14 .",
    "we calculated the spectrum ( [ b1 ] ) by adopting the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . in brief",
    ", we map the honeycomb lattice into a square lattice with two sublattices .",
    "for this square lattice the static field is characterized by the vector @xmath19 and the rational directions are given by @xmath20 .",
    "next we introduce another square lattice of the period @xmath21 , which includes the previous lattice as a sublattice , and rotate it to align its @xmath22 axis with the vector @xmath19 .",
    "finally we use substitution where the wave function is a plane wave along the @xmath23 axis . after this sequence of transformations",

    "( [ b3 ] ) numerically for different @xmath29 and @xmath12 . without any lost of generality",
    "one can restrict @xmath33 to the interval @xmath34 which means @xmath35 .",
    "examples of the spectrum ( [ b1 ] ) are given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where the chosen energy intervals include three band with @xmath36 and three bands with @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the width of the energy bands , @xmath38 as the function of @xmath29 for the field direction @xmath28 ( asterisk ) and some other directions .",
    "[ since @xmath39 is independent of @xmath15 , we drop the sublattice index in eq .",
    "( [ b4 ] ) . ] from the depicted numerical data one draws the following conclusions : the bands are well separated only in the limit of large @xmath29 ; with decrease of @xmath29 the band width @xmath39 monotonically grows while the distance @xmath40 between bands monotonically decreases and , for some @xmath41 , the bands almost touch each other . at this critical field magnitude",
    "@xmath39 takes its maximal value ; after reaching the maximum @xmath39 shows monotonic decrease , where bands become flatter ; this decrease is followed by erratic oscillations of the band width for small @xmath29 .",
    "we note that in this region of small @xmath29 the quantity ( [ b4 ] ) is not sufficient to characterize the spectrum because of rather complicated band pattern with many avoided crossings .",
    "we also studied the asymptotic behavior of @xmath39 for @xmath42 .",
    "our numerical analysis reveals the dependence @xmath43 where @xmath44 increases with the increase of @xmath12 .",
    "for example , @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath27 , etc .",
    "this result is similar to that for the band widths of the landau - stark states ( eigenstates of a quantum particle in the hall configuration ) in the square lattice @xcite .",
    "we believe that the power @xmath48 can be calculated analytically by adopting the perturbative approach of ref .",

    ".,height=340 ]    dependence of the band width @xmath39 on the field direction @xmath33 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , which presents the energy spectrum of the system ( [ 1 ] ) in the form of hofstadter s butterfly .",
    "namely , the figure shows energy bands for angles ( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath49 , where the blue ( dark grey ) and green ( light grey ) colors correspond to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the band widths progressively decrease with increase of @xmath12 .",
    "together with the estimate ( [ b5 ] ) this means that for irrational directions the spectrum is pure point and , hence , ws - states are localized states .",
    "first we check that ws - states for irrational directions are localized states . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare two eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) with nearly the same energy for a ` rational ' @xmath50 ( equivalent to @xmath28 ) and ` irrational ' @xmath51 .",

    "the dashed and solid lines show integrated probabilities along and across the field , respectively .",
    "the field magnitude @xmath55.,width=453 ]    an important characteristic of the localized ws - states is their participation ratio , @xmath56 which indicates how many sites are occupied by a given state .",
    "we note that the participation ratio ( [ b6 ] ) is the same for any ws - state because different ws - states are related to each other by translations . in the other words",
    ", one can obtain the complete set of ws - states from one state ( or few states , if the lattice consists of sublattices ) by translating it across the lattice .",
    "a remarkable feature of the honeycomb ws - states is that their participation ratio wildly oscillates if @xmath29 is varied .",
    "the physics behind these oscillations is the following .",
    "similar to the case considered in the previous subsection the ( now discrete ) spectrum of ws - state consists of two subsets that can be labeled by the subband index @xmath15 or , what is the same , by the letters a and b. correspondently , we have two families of ws - states @xcite . when @xmath29 is varied the energy levels of a- and b - states non - monotonically move on the energy axis .",
    "if two levels of different symmetry come close to each other they develop an avoided crossing where the a- and b - states hybridize . as a consequence of the hybridization",
    "the function @xmath57 shows a local maximum , see inset in fig .",
    "it should be mentioned that to resolve all local peaks of @xmath58 ( i.e , all avoided crossings in the spectrum ) the step over @xmath29 or , more precisely , over @xmath59 should be infinitesimally small .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the function @xmath57 for a moderate step where only large peaks are resolved .",
    "erratic oscillations with increasing density of peaks are clearly seen .",
    "this figure also reveals the expected average growth of the participation ratio when @xmath29 is decreased .    .",
    "the thick and thin lines show the square root of the participation ratio ( [ b6 ] ) of ws - states for the square and honeycomb lattices , respectively .",
    "the inset zooms into the region @xmath60.,height=340 ]    it is interesting to compare the localized honeycomb ws - states against the analytic results for the simple square lattice , @xmath61 ( here @xmath62 is the bessel functions of the first kind ) .",
    "the square lattice has only one family of ws - states and , correspondently , the energy levels show no avoided crossings",
    ". participation ration of the states ( [ b7 ] ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by the thick line . comparing two curves",
    "we conclude that ws - state in the honeycomb lattice are irregular or chaotic states , which are known to be sensitive to variations of the system parameters .",
    "the statistical analysis of these states in spirit of the random matrix theory will be presented elsewhere .",
    "to study bloch dynamics of the system ( [ 1 ] ) it is convenient to use the interaction representation with respect to the stark term .",
    "this results in the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the bloch frequencies .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) commutes with the translation operator .",
    "thus , when considering translation - invariant solutions of the schrdinger equation , we can impose periodic boundary conditions .      consider initial state of the system @xmath65 given by an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ 0 ] ) , i.e. , by the bloch wave @xmath66 with the quasimomentum @xmath67 .",
    "then the time evolution of this state is naively expected to obey the equation @xmath68 , that is known as the acceleration theorem .",
    "this simple bloch dynamics , however , is complicated by the fact that the spectrum of @xmath69 consist of two subbands , @xmath70 with the energy gap vanishing at the dirac points .",
    "thus one generally can not avoid interband lz - tunneling and the actual time evolution is given by the equation @xmath71 where @xmath15 is the bloch subband index .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows a typical dynamics of the coefficients @xmath72 and the lower panel depicts the energies ( [ 5 ] ) at @xmath73 .",

    "figure [ fig8 ] compares dynamics of @xmath77 , the projection of the mean momentum on the @xmath22 axis , for @xmath55 and @xmath76 ( upper panel ) and @xmath75 ( lower panel ) . in the former case the particle trajectory in",
    "the ( quasi)momentum space goes between dirac points and lz - tunneling can be neglected for chosen @xmath29 .",
    "thus the upper subband remains unpopulated and we observe nice periodic oscillations of @xmath77 . in the latter case",
    "the upper subband gets populated independent of how small @xmath29 is . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath77 shows irregular oscillations where one hardly recognize the former periodic bo .",
    "wave - packet dynamics in a 2d lattice with two bloch subbands was considered earlier in ref .",
    "the wave packet was found to have a tendency to spread in the direction orthogonal to @xmath5 , while in the direction parallel to @xmath5 it shows oscillatory dynamics . in this work",
    "we consider the limiting case of a localized initial packet where only one site is populated at @xmath78 .",
    "also we will discuss dynamics in terms of ws - states instead of discussing it in terms of bloch states as it was done in the above cited papers . to describe the wave - packet dynamics",
    "we introduce the time - dependent analogue of eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) , @xmath79 according to the results of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we expect qualitatively different dynamics of the participation ratio ( [ 7 ] ) for rational and irrational field directions .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath80 for @xmath55 and rational direction @xmath76 .",
    "the participation ratio exhibits oscillatory dynamics superimposed with a linear increase in the mean value .",
    "this linear increase is due to ballistic spreading of the packet in the direction orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "the rate of ballistic spreading is obviously defined by the width @xmath39 of the wannier - stark bands , while the characteristic frequency of oscillations is given by the distance between neighboring wannier - stark bands .    ) for @xmath76 ( dashed line ) and @xmath75 ( solid line ) .",
    "the initial condition corresponds to population of a single site in the center of the lattice .",
    "the value of the static force @xmath55.,height=340 ]    the case of irrational direction @xmath75 is depicted by the solid line in fig .",
    "now @xmath80 saturates at some level defined by the characteristic localization length of the honeycomb ws - states .",
    "the wave - packet simulations also confirm @xmath81 scaling law for saturation level of @xmath80 that follows from the @xmath81 scaling law for the participation ratio of the localized honeycomb ws - states .",
    "we would like to mention that for some choices of the system parameters we observed rather exotic wave - packet dynamics .",
    "one example is @xmath28 and @xmath82 . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , for these parameters the energy bands are almost straight lines , that implies nondispersive dynamics . indeed , in our simulations we observed the formation of two soliton - like packets that propagate with constant velocities in opposite directions .",
    "we found ws - states of a quantum particle in a tilted honeycomb lattice and compared them with ws - states in the tilted square lattice that are known analytically .",
    "the comparison is done for both rational and irrational directions of the field vector @xmath5 . for rational directions of the field defined in eqs .",
    "( [ 2]-[3 ] ) the energies of ws - states form energy bands . for the square lattice these bands have zero width , excluding the case where @xmath5 is aligned with one of two primary axes .",
    "this prohibits any transport in the system if the vector @xmath5 is misaligned with a primary axis .",
    "unlike this situation , for the honeycomb lattice the bands have finite width for any rational direction . if the condition ( [ 3 ] ) is fulfilled , an initially localized wave packet spreads in the direction orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this type of wave - packet dynamics exist in the square lattice only in the presence of a gauge field normal to the lattice plane @xcite .    for irrational directions of the field",
    "the energy spectrum of ws - states is discrete and , hence , they are localized states .",
    "we found the localization length of the honeycomb ws - states , which we define as the square root of the participation ratio ( [ b6 ] ) , to grow in average as @xmath83 , i.e. , in the same way as for the square lattice .",
    "however , in a smaller scale the localization length shows large fluctuations that do not present in the case of square lattice .",
    "this observation motivates us to put forward a hypothesis about irregular ( chaotic ) nature of the honeycomb ws - states .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the irregular character of bo for irrational directions of the static field .",
    "the results of this work can be verified in laboratory experiments with cold atoms in honeycomb optical lattices @xcite , honeycomb photonic crystals @xcite , and microwave billiards with honeycomb array of scatterers @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these systems is that they offer direct visualization of the ` wave function ' .",
    "another direction is ballistic conductivity of the graphene sheets .",
    "it is expected that the reported non - analytic angular dependence of ws - states could strongly affect the conductivity .",
