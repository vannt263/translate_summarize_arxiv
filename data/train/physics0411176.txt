    "the manipulation of ultracold matter waves can now , somewhat routinely , be performed above microchip or magnetized surfaces @xcite . in such experiments ,",
    "the quantum nature of the dilute atomic gases dominates over the classical , enabling precision matter wave control @xcite .",
    "one of the key requirements in using an `` atom chip '' to perform atom optics is the ability to transport atoms from one atom optical component to another . here , we present calculations of wave propagation through waveguides with idealized perturbations consisting of sudden changes to the transverse confining potential .",
    "an increase ( decrease ) in the tranverse confining potential results in a decrease ( increase ) in the kinetic energy along the direction of wave propagation , providing effective step potentials along the waveguide .",
    "the present study was motivated in three ways .",
    "firstly , recent experiments have demonstrated a significant fragmentation of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a waveguide located close to the surfaces @xcite , attributed , at least in part , to imperfections created during the wire fabrication processes @xcite .",
    "secondly , to further understand some of the limitations to designing atom optics devices that are based on variations of the waveguide potentials , for example , the smoothly varying wide  narrow  wide wire geometry has been proposed as a quantum - point - contact type device for atoms @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the literature has been lacking a multimode analysis of many of the simplest waveguide geometries , as it has been experimentally shown that introducing a perturbation in a waveguide can result in the transverse excitation of a bec @xcite .    to characterize the impact of transverse discontinuities , here we explore the schrdinger wave mechanics of waveguides with step - like , barrier - like and well - like potentials along the direction of propagation .",
    "there have already been some theoretical investigations using time - dependent calculations of wave propagation through smooth potentials such as a bottleneck ( step - up ) and a smooth termination ( extreme step - down ) in the limit of non - interacting atoms @xcite , while non - linear ( atom - atom ) effects in the bottleneck - type geometry have also been examined @xcite .",
    "the advantages in using abrupt potentials whilst neglecting atom - atom interactions is that simple time - independent calculations can be used to characterize the transmission and reflection probabilities . under these conditions ,",
    "we have previously investigated a circular bend @xcite , which consists of an abrupt transition from the lead waveguides into the bend and at low - energies behaves like a potential well .",
    "our multimode analysis , restricted as it is to the the linear regime , provides a baseline for comparison of bec propagation through quasi - one - dimensional ( 1-d ) waveguides including the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , previous time - independent studies have investigated non - linear wave propagation through shallow - well , step and gaussian shaped 1-d potentials @xcite .",
    "such simple waveguide potentials could be generated by modifying the transverse confinement , where knowledge of the transverse excitation probabilities , in the abrupt and linear limits , should be useful .    for ground mode matter waves propagating at low energies through the various perturbations ,",
    "the present results show that the spectra rapidly depart from single - moded , with significant transmission and reflection of excited modes .",
    "the high - energy limit sees @xmath0 transmission , and we present a simple model to determine the distribution of the transmitted modes that combines the overlap of the mode wave functions with the multi - path interference of the modes .",
    "there are a number of atom chip wire configurations that can create waveguides @xcite , but we follow the theoretical ansatz adopted in refs .",
    "that is , we assume that the waveguides consist of an idealized trapping potential that is quadratic near the minimum and operate at low matter - wave densities such that atom - atom interactions can be neglected . furthermore , so that the waveguide potentials reduce to an effective 2d problem , the waveguides are assumed to be created by multiple wire configurations with abrupt changes in the spacing between the wires , such that the height and transverse position of the potential minima remains constant along the waveguide .",

    "the two methods are similar , however , and since the transfer matrix approach facilitates the discussion of our results , we outline it here .",

    "given that the wave is restricted to incoming from @xmath29 in the ground mode ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) , the linear equation @xmath33 is solved , and then @xmath34 .",
    "the transmission and reflection probabilities for each mode are then given by : @xmath35    there are convergence difficulties with the transfer matrix approach , the demonstration and discussion of which is mostly relegated to the appendix . in brief , the problems are related to the slow decay of the sho overlaps @xmath36 with @xmath37 , which requires the inclusion of strongly closed channels , leading to the appearance of large exponentials in the transfer matrix . while the transfer matrix method eliminates the need to find intermediate coefficients ( ie .",

    "although , to the best of our knowledge , calculations for such electron waveguides have not discussed high - energy / abrupt potential transmission and reflection limits .    a further condition was suggested for high energy transmission through microstructures with multiple interfaces to account for the interference between modes .",
    "it was shown that a simple two - mode model can give a reasonable approximation to the amount of ground mode transmission , and provides an additional consideration for the design of `` atom - chip '' waveguides to control single - moded wave - transmission through potentials that generate multimoded excitations .",
    "this research was supported by the department of the navy , office of naval research , and also by the research corporation .",
    "our transfer matrix program was validated by reproducing the single - mode calculations of electron propagation through a linear array of 1-d potentials @xcite , and secondly by comparing with multi - moded 2-d results from an interface matching program @xcite .",
    "the multimode transfer matrix method , however , has numerical convergence difficulties as the number of modes included in a calculation increases .",
    "this behavior can be seen in table [ tab : transconv ] , for scattering with different incident energies @xmath82 off a barrier - like potential with @xmath146 of length @xmath147 .",
    "the unitarity of the transfer matrix results deviate significantly from @xmath148 , even as @xmath149 is increased .",
    "the interface matching calculations are shown for comparison , and barely suffer from the same problems .",
