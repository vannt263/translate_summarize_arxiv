    "despite a long history of research on the glass transition @xcite , this phenomenon is still commonly regarded as an unresolved problem . in recent years",
    "a variety of new theoretical and phenomenological approaches of the glass transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) stimulated new experimental investigations of the dynamic response of glass - forming liquids ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here dielectric spectroscopy has played an important role , mainly due to the broad dynamic range accessible with this method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "spectra of the dielectric loss @xmath1 show a variety of features , the microscopic origin of most of them being still controversially discussed .",
    "most prominent is the @xmath0-peak associated with the well known @xmath0- or structural - relaxation process .",
    "the comparison of the non - trivial temperature dependence of the @xmath0-relaxation time with theoretical predictions states an important test for any model of the glass - transition .",
    "some decades above the @xmath0-peak frequency @xmath2 , an excess wing ( also called  high - frequency wing  or  tail  ) shows up as high - frequency excess contribution to the power law @xmath3 , commonly found at @xmath4 .",
    "this excess wing seems to be a universal feature of glass - forming liquids as can be deduced from the scaling behavior found by nagel and coworkers @xcite .",
    "based on this universal scaling of @xmath0-relaxation and excess wing , nagel and coworkers @xcite proposed a divergence of the static susceptibility which essentially implies a constant loss behavior at high frequencies and low temperatures as has early been predicted by wong and angell @xcite .",
    "the interest in even higher frequencies , in the ghz - thz region , was mainly stimulated by the mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite , which explains the glass transition in terms of a dynamic phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath5significantly above the glass temperature @xmath6 . from neutron- and light - scattering experiments",
    "it is well known that in the thz region the so - called boson peak shows up in the imaginary part of the susceptibility of glass - forming liquids . for the transition region between @xmath7-process and boson peak , mct predicts an additional contribution , now commonly termed fast @xmath8-relaxation . but also other models predict fast processes , the most prominent being the coupling model by ngai and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this transition region was mainly investigated by neutron and light scattering and indeed indications for additional fast processes were found @xcite .",
    "the scattering results were described within the framework of mct and partly good agreement with the theoretical results was obtained .",
    "however , the applicability of the mct for glass - forming liquids , especially at low temperatures near @xmath6 , is still a matter of controversy .",
    "dielectric data were scarce in the relevant high - frequency region as for classical dielectric methods the region above ghz is not accessible . only recently , our group was able to obtain continuous dielectric spectra on glass - forming liquids extending well into the submillimeter wavelength region @xcite .",
    "the existence of a broad minimum in @xmath9 was found which can not be explained by a simple crossover from the structural ( @xmath0- ) relaxation to the far - infrared ( fir ) vibrational response .",
    "similar to the scattering results , clear indications for additional fast processes prevailing in this transition region were found . for glass - forming glycerol , by combining classical dielectric spectroscopy , coaxial transmission , quasi - optic submillimeter and far - infrared techniques , spectra covering 18 decades of frequency and extending well into the thz range were obtained @xcite .",
    "this allowed for the observation of the complete dynamic response including the boson peak .",
    "in addition , dielectric spectra up to 380 ghz were obtained in [ ca(no@xmath10)@xmath11@xmath12[kno@xmath10]@xmath14 ( ckn ) and [ ca(no@xmath10)@xmath11@xmath12[rbno@xmath10]@xmath14 ( crn ) @xcite .",
    "both are ionically conducting , molten - salt glass formers with relatively high fragility @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , glycerol is a rather strong hydrogen - bonded glass - former with a fragility parameter of @xmath16 @xcite . in many respects , especially concerning the high - frequency response near the boson peak and the agreement of the dielectric data with mct predictions and with the scattering results , glycerol and",
    "the molten salts behave qualitatively different . in order to clarify the origin of these differences and in the light of the dependence of the boson peak contribution on fragility @xcite",
    ", it seemed of interest to investigate a fragile , but molecular glass - former .",
    "for this purpose we have chosen propylene carbonate ( pc ) which like glycerol is a molecular glass former , but can be characterized as a fragile ( @xmath17,@xcite ) van der waals liquid .",
    "preliminary results on pc in a somewhat restricted frequency range have been published earlier @xcite . in the present paper we present extended results covering the complete dynamic range including the boson peak .",
    "we address all features seen in the dielectric spectra , i.e. the @xmath7-response , the excess wing , the fast @xmath8-relaxation region and the boson peak .",
    "the results are compared with a variety of theoretical predictions and with the findings from other experimental methods .",
    "the measurements presented in this article have been performed using a variety of different techniques to cover nearly 20 decades in frequency .",
    "the lowest frequencies ( @xmath18 @xmath19hz ) were investigated in the time - domain using a spectrometer that is based on a design described by mopsik @xcite .",
    "the complex dielectric constant was calculated from the measured response function via a fourier transformation .",
    "the autobalance bridges hp4284 and hp4285 were used in the range @xmath20 hz @xmath21 mhz . for the radio - frequency and microwave range ( @xmath22 mhz @xmath23 ghz ) a reflectometric technique was employed @xcite using the hp4191 and hp4291 impedance analyzers and the hp8510 network analyzer . in addition , at frequencies @xmath24 mhz @xmath25 ghz data were taken in transmission with the hp8510 network analyzer using 7 mm coaxial lines of various lengths ( between 10 and 300 mm ) filled with the sample material .",
    "closed - cycle refrigerators , n@xmath26- , and he - cryostats have been used to cover the relevant temperature ranges .    at frequencies",
    "@xmath27 ghz @xmath28 thz a quasi - optical submillimeter spectrometer was used with an experimental arrangement similar to a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "this setup allows for measuring the frequency dependence of both the transmission and the phase shift of a monochromatic electromagnetic beam through the sample .",
    "the frequency range up to 1.2thz is covered continuously by 10 tunable narrow - band backward - wave oscillators ( bwos ) .",
    "the signal was detected by a golay cell or a pumped he bolometer and amplified using lock - in techniques .",
    "the liquid was put in specially designed cells made of polished stainless steel with thin plane - parallel quartz windows ; depending on the range of frequency and temperature the thickness of the sample cell was between 1 mm and 30 mm .",
    "the sample cell was placed in a home - made cryostat and cooled by a continuous flow of nitrogen gas .",
    "the data were analyzed using optical formulae for multilayer interference @xcite with the known thickness and optical parameters of the windows in order to get the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant of the sample as a function of frequency at various temperatures . at higher frequencies ( 600ghz @xmath29 3thz )",
    "the samples were investigated with a fourier - transform infrared spectrometer covering a regime from 450ghz to 10thz .",
    "this set - up allows the measurement of the transmission or reflection only , whereas the phase shift caused by the sample can not be determined .    to cover the complete frequency range , a single @xmath30 curve at a given temperature",
    "is superimposed using results from the various setups .",
    "the time - domain results are obtained in arbitrary units and scaled by one factor to match the autobalance bridge results . for the measurements at @xmath22 ghz @xmath31 ghz there are some uncertainties of the absolute values originating from an ill - defined geometry of the samples or parasitic elements .",
    "these results have been partly shifted by one scaling factor per measurement series which led to a good match at both the low and the high frequency side . typically , shifting factors of less than @xmath32 had to be applied to obtain smooth curves .",
    "the submillimeter - frequency results and , at losses @xmath33 , also the coaxial transmission measurements provide excellent absolute values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the values for @xmath1 from the infrared measurements were calculated consistently with the kramers - kronig relation assuming a reasonable behavior of the dielectric constant @xmath36 which is almost constant in this frequency regime . in this latter case",
    ", the error bars for @xmath1 were estimated by variation of the assumed @xmath34 behavior .    as sample material , propylene carbonate ( @xmath37 k @xcite , @xmath38 k ) with a purity of @xmath39 , was used . to avoid crystallization polished sample holders had to be used in the various experiments . however",
    ", occasional crystallization , mainly at temperatures around @xmath40 k could not be avoided completely .",
    "therefore some measurements were performed after heating up to @xmath41 and direct cooling to each measurement temperature with relatively fast cooling rates ( @xmath22 k / min ) .",
    "figures [ eps1 ] and [ eps2 ] show @xmath43 and @xmath44 for various temperatures in the whole accessible frequency range .",
    "@xmath9 ( fig . [ eps2 ] ) exhibits the typical asymmetrically shaped @xmath0-relaxation peaks shifting through the frequency window with temperature .",
    "they are accompanied by relaxation steps in @xmath43 as seen in fig .",
    "[ eps1 ] . in most respects",
    "the data agree well with the results of earlier dielectric investigations of pc @xcite which were restricted to smaller frequency and temperature ranges .",
    "however , some differences show up in the absolute values ( see below ) .",
    "the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ eps1 ] and [ eps2 ] are fits of the @xmath0-relaxation region with the empirical cole - davidson function @xcite , @xmath45 , performed simultaneously for real and imaginary part .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the low- and high - frequency limit of the dielectric constant , respectively .",
    "a good fit of the peak region was achieved . very close to the maximum the loss curves",
    "can also be described by the fourier transform of the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) function @xcite , @xmath48 $ ] , ( dotted lines , shown for 173 k , only ) .",
    "for all temperatures investigated the kww fit is of lower quality than the cd fit .",
    "this can be ascribed to the fact that there is a significant difference of cd and kww response concerning the loss - peak region . for the kww response the curvature near the peak",
    "is retained somewhat further above the peak frequency and a power law @xmath49 is approached at significantly higher frequencies only .",
    "therefore , in most cases the exponent @xmath50 obtained from the kww fits differs significantly from the power law exponent @xmath8 actually observed for @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , for the cd fits @xmath51 is found . despite the kww function is more widely used nowadays , in the authors experience dielectric loss data in glass - forming materials are often described much better by the cd function @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ eps2 ] shows the temperature dependence of the frequency @xmath52 which is virtually identical to the peak frequency @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath53 denotes the mean relaxation time @xcite calculated from @xmath54 for the cd function and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 denoting the gamma function ) for the kww function .",
    "the results from the cd ( circles ) and the kww fits ( pluses ) agree perfectly well and are in accord with previously published data @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 shows the well known deviations from thermally activated behavior , typical for fragile glass - formers .",
    "it can be parameterized using the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) equation @xcite ( line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ eps2 ] ; see section [ discalp ] ) .    in figure [ betchi](a )",
    "the relaxation strengths @xmath58 @xmath59 obtained from the cd and kww fits are shown .",
    "one has to be aware that @xmath60 resulting from the fits is somewhat smaller that @xmath60 read off from the @xmath61 data of fig .",
    "[ eps1 ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ eps1 ] , the fits overestimate @xmath47 because there is an additional decrease of @xmath43 corresponding to the excess wing contribution ( see below ) which is not taken into account by the cd fits .",
    "consequently @xmath60 shown in fig .",
    "[ betchi](a ) presents the relaxation strength of the @xmath0-process alone , without the excess wing contribution .",
    "@xmath60 decreases monotonically with temperature which is in accord with previous reports @xcite .",
    "however , the decrease found in the present work is somewhat less steep than reported earlier .",
    "unfortunately , in @xcite where a rather broad temperature and frequency range was investigated no absolute values of @xmath60 were reported .",
    "the results from the high frequency measurements of payne and theodorou @xcite are compatible with our data at @xmath62 k except for their lowest temperature ( @xmath63 k ) where a much higher value ( @xmath64 ) was found .",
    "however , the relaxation time at @xmath65 k reported by these authors deviates by more than one decade from that found in the present and other works @xcite which sheds some doubt upon the significance of the results at this temperature .",
    "also from the results of huck _",
    "_ @xcite and angell _ et al . _",
    "_  _ near @xmath66 k a much higher magnitude of @xmath60 ( @xmath67 ) than determined here can be read off .",
    "the determination of the absolute values of @xmath68 is a difficult task as it depends on the shifting factors necessary to match results from different experimental set - ups and on the subtraction of possible stray capacitances inherent to some methods .",
    "we believe , that due to the broad overlap of the frequency ranges of the various devices used in the present work , the reproducibility of results with different sample holders , and the simultaneous fitting of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , fig . [ betchi](a ) gives a good estimate of the absolute value of @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ betchi](b ) shows the width parameter obtained from both fitting procedures .",
    "both , @xmath69 and @xmath50 increase nearly linearly with temperature up to about @xmath70 k. above this temperature a tendency to saturate at a value below unity is observed .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite where @xmath71 was reported to saturate at unity for high temperatures .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the smaller frequency range available in @xcite which for high temperatures leads to a restriction of the data at the high - frequency side of the loss peaks , that is essential for the determination of @xmath69 .",
    "unfortunately , no @xmath44 data of pc are shown in @xcite .    at frequencies about 2 - 3 decades above @xmath2 deviations of @xmath72 from the cd - fits",
    "show up . for low temperatures",
    "these deviations can be described as second power law , @xmath73 with @xmath74 , in addition to the power law @xmath75 constituting the high frequency flank of the @xmath0-peak .",
    "the exponent @xmath76 decreases with decreasing temperature as found previously for pc and other glass - forming materials @xcite .",
    "the excess wing is accompanied by a decrease in @xmath61 as mentioned above .",
    "it shows up as a somewhat smoother rounding of the @xmath43 curves ( compared , e.g. , to the cd behavior ) when approaching @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ eps1 ] ) . for @xmath77",
    "k the exponent @xmath76 has reached a value almost identical with @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ eps2 ] ) and for @xmath78 k the excess wing seems to have merged with the @xmath0-peak . for @xmath79 @xmath78",
    "k the deviations of the experimental data from the cd - fits are due to the fast dynamic processes described in the following section .      at high frequencies , succeeding the excess wing for low and the @xmath0-peak for high temperatures , @xmath80 exhibits a smooth transition into a shallow minimum .",
    "such a minimum was earlier observed in glycerol @xcite , salol @xcite , the molten salts ckn @xcite and crn @xcite , and the plastic crystals cyclo - octanol @xcite and ortho - carborane @xcite . with increasing temperature , the amplitude @xmath81 and frequency position @xmath82 of the minimum increases .",
    "for room temperature the measurements have been extended into the fir region . here",
    "no minimum is observed , but a shoulder shows up near 1 thz .",
    "this shoulder is indicative of the so - called boson peak known mainly from neutron- and light - scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed , for pc the boson peak , determined from light - scattering measurements @xcite , is located just above 1 thz . as the peak frequency and amplitude is only weakly temperature dependent",
    ", it becomes obvious that the high - frequency flank of the @xmath9-minimum is identical to the low - frequency flank of the boson peak .",
    "the frequency dependence in this region can be approximately described by a power law @xmath83 .",
    "the exponent @xmath84 increases with decreasing temperature and seems to approach a linear behavior as indicated by the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ eps2 ] . in @xmath43 for these frequencies the onset of a relaxation step corresponding to the boson peak can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ eps1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ vgl ] we compare @xmath9 with @xmath85 calculated from the light scattering results on pc @xcite . as the light scattering results give no information on the absolute values of @xmath1 , the datasets have been scaled to yield a comparable height of the boson peak .",
    "while the dielectric results in pc are qualitatively similar to the light scattering results ( succession of @xmath0-peak , minimum , and boson peak ) , quantitative differences show up : the @xmath0-peak is located at a significantly lower frequency and the ratio of the amplitudes of @xmath0- and boson peak is higher for the dielectric measurements .",
    "the latter behavior was also found in our experiments on glycerol @xcite and salol @xcite , and in molecular dynamics simulations of ortho - terphenyl @xcite and of a system of rigid diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "the results from a very recent neutron scattering study of pc @xcite indicate an even smaller ratio of @xmath0- and boson peak amplitude than for light scattering . clearly",
    "the position of the minimum differs between the different methods , also in accordance with results on other systems @xcite . in contrast , the increase towards the boson peak exhibits almost identical power laws for the dielectric and light scattering measurements .",
    "the most significant result of an analysis of the @xmath0-relaxation process is the temperature dependence of the @xmath0-relaxation time which is compared to various predictions in fig .",
    "figure [ tau](a ) shows the same fit with the vft equation @xcite ,      as in the inset of fig .",
    "[ eps2 ] . a vft temperature @xmath87 k and",
    "a strength parameter @xmath88were determined , the latter characterizing pc as fragile glass former @xcite .",
    "while the vft equation is primarily an empirical description , a theoretical foundation was given in various models , e.g. the adam - gibbs theory @xcite or the free volume theory @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ tau](a ) it becomes obvious that , above a crossover temperature @xmath89 k , deviations from vft behavior show up , similar to those seen in earlier work @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite a transition to thermally activated behavior was suggested as demonstrated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ tau](a ) .",
    "@xmath90 was interpreted @xcite as temperature below which the potential energy landscape becomes important .",
    "however , one has to state that also alternative descriptions are possible , e.g. using vft behavior at high and a thermally activated behavior at low temperatures or a combination of vft functions @xcite .",
    "in addition , stickel et al . @xcite performed an analysis of relaxation - time data on pc extending to temperatures above room temperature using a temperature - derivative method @xcite .",
    "they reported a transition between two vft laws at about @xmath70 k and a second transition to thermally activated behavior above about @xmath91 k. overall , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ tau](a ) , the three - parameter vft function is not able to describe the data in the whole temperature range and a crossover to a different behavior has to be assumed to overcome this difficulty .",
    "a four - parameter function for the description of @xmath92 is the outcome of the extended free volume ( efv ) theory @xcite . in the efv theory the supercooled liquid",
    "is assumed to be divided into liquid - like and solid - like regions . at a temperature @xmath93",
    "a transition from percolating ( fluid ) to isolated liquid - like regions ( solid glass state ) occurs . by addressing the entropy of the glass - forming system and making use of percolation theory the following result for @xmath92",

    "this setback may be overcome when employing the extended mct , which is out of the scope of the present work .",

    "is observed at temperatures above about @xmath134 k.    finally we want to mention that it is also possible to describe the excess wing by an additional relaxation process superimposed to the @xmath0-process @xcite .",
    "such secondary processes , usually termed ( slow ) @xmath135-processes , can often be ascribed to an internal change of the molecular conformation . however , in the light of the universal properties of the wing for different glass - forming liquids revealed by the nagel - scaling , it is unreasonable to ascribe it to this type of @xmath8-relaxations which depend on the specific molecular structure .",
    "the finding that secondary relaxation processes can show up also in simple glass formers led to the assumption of a more fundamental reason for these so - called johari - goldstein @xmath8-processes @xcite .",
    "also recent theoretical developments @xcite within the coupling model @xcite may point in the direction of a universal slow @xmath8-relaxation , closely connected to the @xmath0-process . it can not be excluded that the wing and these possible intrinsic @xmath136-relaxations are manifestations of the same microscopic mechanism .        in fig .",
    "[ mctfits ] , a magnified view of the high - frequency region of @xmath9 is shown . in the inset we tried to analyze the minimum region in terms of a simple crossover from @xmath0-relaxation or excess wing to the boson peak .",
    "for the low frequency wing of the boson peak a linear or steeper increase of @xmath44 can be assumed as is commonly found for a variety of glass - formers @xcite . indeed , for the lowest temperatures investigated , where vibrational contributions can be assumed to become dominant , a linear increase of @xmath9 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ mctfits ] ) is approached .",
    "also , in order for the boson peak to appear in the light- or neutron - scattering spectra ( where it was first observed ) , @xmath138 must increase steeper than linearly towards the boson peak .",
    "the dashed lines in the inset of fig .",
    "[ mctfits ] have been calculated by a sum of two power laws , @xmath139 with @xmath140 @xcite .",

    "clearly there is no way to obtain a reasonable fit of the experimental data in this way .",
    "this analysis clearly implies the presence of additional fast processes in this region , usually termed fast @xmath8-processes .",
    "similar findings were obtained for a variety of glass - formers @xcite .",
    "fast processes are not considered in the efv model @xcite , which provides the best fits to the dynamics of the @xmath0-process ( section [ discalp ] ) . within this model , molecules are assumed to move within cages formed by their next neighbors and diffusional motion occurs by hopping into  free volume ",
    "available to the molecule .",
    "it is interesting that this picture is qualitatively similar to that of mct where fast processes are a natural consequence of the theory .",
    "but a theoretical investigation of these possible fast processes in the efv is missing . in the fld model",
    "@xcite the @xmath0-relaxation is identified with the restructuring of the flds and occurs on a length scale given by their characteristic size . within the fld framework",
    "there is a second length scale , the correlation length @xmath142 of the lps .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the experimentally observed fast @xmath136-processes may be ascribed to fast relaxations taking place on this smaller length scale of the fld model .",
    "however , up to now a theoretical elaboration of the fast processes within fld theory is missing .",
    "another model predicting fast processes is the coupling model ( cm )  of ngai and coworkers @xcite . here",
    "the fast process is part of the @xmath0-relaxation , defined in the time domain .",
    "the @xmath0-relaxation is assumed to be composed of a fast exponential decay with relaxation time @xmath143 at short times @xmath144 , and a slower kww behavior with relaxation time @xmath145 and stretching parameter @xmath146 at @xmath147 .",
    "the crossover time @xmath148 was stated to be of the order of ps for most systems @xcite .",
    "demanding continuity at @xmath148 leads to the relation : @xmath149    this allows for the determination of the relaxation time @xmath143 of the fast process , if the kww - parameters of the slow process are known .",
    "the parameters determined from the kww - fits of the @xmath0-relaxation in pc ( section [ discalp ] ) result in a factor @xmath150 for the highest temperature and @xmath151 for @xmath152 k. obviously , the fast process inherent in the cm is located at much lower frequencies than the @xmath9-minimum and therefore can not be brought into play for the explanation of the excess intensity in this region .",
    "instead additional contributions need to be assumed but , as shown in the beginning of this section , a combination of @xmath7-process ( even including the cm 's fast process ) and boson peak alone can not take account of the experimental data . further contributions may arise @xcite , e.g. , from a constant loss term as early proposed by wong and angell @xcite and/or a possible @xmath153 behavior , both seemingly universal features in the dielectric response of glassy ionic conductors @xcite .",
    "possible microscopic explanations for these contributions were proposed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the data in pc near the @xmath9-minimum can well be described by adding a term @xmath154 to the ansatz of eq .",
    "[ pheno ] @xcite . in this way , by adjusting the parameters to achieve a smooth transition to the cd - curves describing the @xmath0-peak , quite impressive fits over 17 decades of frequency are possible .",
    "of course this could be expected considering the large amount of parameters involved in the fitting , but nevertheless it can not be excluded that such a simple superposition ansatz of different independent contributions is correct .",
    "very recently a model was proposed considering a low - frequency relaxation - like part of the vibration susceptibility function responsible for the boson peak @xcite .",
    "this relaxation - like response was shown to arise from anharmonicity of vibrations and invoked to explain the quasielastic line seen in light and neutron scattering .",
    "this quasielastic contribution corresponds to the fast @xmath8-process seen in the region below the boson peak in the susceptibility spectra . within this framework ,",
    "the fast process should show up as peak with @xmath155 and @xmath156 at its low and high - frequency side , respectively .",
    "for the absolute value of the exponent @xmath0 ,  reasonable values ranging between 0.375 and 1 were given in @xcite , depending on the system .",
    "of course no peak is seen between @xmath0- and boson peak in the spectra of pc ( figs .",
    "[ eps2 ] and [ mctfits ] ) but the @xmath157-wing of the fast @xmath8-process may be obscured by the domination of the boson peak at higher frequencies .",
    "a severe argument against this picture is the smooth transition of @xmath9 from the minimum to the boson peak with only one power law , which seems unlikely to result from the superposition of the @xmath158-wing of the fast @xmath8-process and the low frequency wing of the boson peak ( steeper than @xmath159 , see above ) .",
    "however , this possibility can not fully be excluded and at least this model provides an explanation for the sublinear increase seen for @xmath160 .",
    "it is interesting , that within this theoretical framework a crossover temperature of the fast relaxation was obtained which was found to be of similar magnitude as the critical temperature @xmath97 of mct @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a fast process in the minimum region of @xmath44 is one of the main outcomes of mct , a prediction which led to the huge interest in this high - frequency region . within idealized mct , above @xmath97 , the high and low - frequency wings close to the minimum of @xmath9 are described by power laws with exponents @xmath84 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the minimum region can be approximated by the interpolation formula @xcite :      @xmath162 and @xmath163 denote position and amplitude of the minimum , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath84 and @xmath76 are temperature independent and constrained by the exponent parameter @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the gamma function .",
    "this restricts the exponent @xmath84 to values below @xmath166 , i.e. a significantly sublinear increase of @xmath72 at frequencies above the minimum is predicted .",
    "we found a consistent description of the @xmath1-minima at @xmath167 k using @xmath168 which implies @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( solid lines in fig .",

    "[ eqmctmin ] . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that this deviation in glycerol is due to the vibrational boson peak contribution which is not taken into account by eq .",

    "this is in accord with the finding of sokolov _",

    "the deviations of data and fits , seen at low frequencies in fig .",

    "this lies in the same range as the @xmath97 obtained from light scattering @xcite ( @xmath178 k ) , neutron scattering @xcite ( @xmath40 - @xmath70 k ) , and solvation dynamics experiments @xcite ( @xmath179 k ) .",
    "also the @xmath180 k , deduced from a preliminary analysis of the susceptibility minimum from recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite , agrees well with the present value . for temperatures near @xmath97",
    "the @xmath181-data deviate from the predicted behavior as also seen in fig .",
    "[ tau](c ) . within mct",
    "this can be ascribed to a smearing out of the critical behavior near @xmath97 due to hopping processes which are considered in extended versions of mct only @xcite .",
    "in addition , the above critical temperature dependences of @xmath182 , @xmath162 and @xmath2 should be valid only for temperatures not too far above @xmath97 and the deviations seen for @xmath162 and @xmath183 at high temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ mopa ] ) may be due to this fact .",
    "therefore there is a problem concerning the proper choice of the temperature range to be used for the determination of @xmath97 . while the critical behavior proposed in fig .",
    "[ mopa ] seems reasonable , some uncertainties concerning the value of @xmath97 remain which can only be clarified by an analysis within the extended mct .",
    "mct predicts a significant change in the behavior of @xmath118 at @xmath97 : for @xmath113 , within idealized mct @xmath72 should exhibit a so - called  knee  at a frequency @xmath184 , i.e. a change of power law from @xmath185 at @xmath186 @xmath187 to @xmath188 at @xmath189 . within idealized mct , at @xmath113 the minimum and",

    "overall , a lack of significance of the observed knee - feature has to be stated but at least the data show where the knee may be located and where more experimental work has to be done to check for its presence and temperature evolution in pc .      the comparison of dielectric and the scattering results is shown in fig .",
    "as mentioned above ( section [ resfast ] ) the significantly larger ratio of @xmath0- and boson peak amplitude for dielectric compared with light scattering results seems to be a rather universal property of glass - forming materials @xcite . recently ,",

    "in addition , in a recent theoretical work @xcite mct was generalized to molecular liquids of molecules with orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting mct equations were solved for a system of dipolar hard spheres and a larger ratio of @xmath0- and boson peak amplitude for @xmath198 was obtained in accordance with the experimental findings .",

    "it seems that in glycerol the fast @xmath8-process giving rise to the shallow minimum in @xmath9 or the third linear region in the scaling plot , is obscured at higher frequencies by the boson peak contribution .",

    "et al_. @xcite of a higher amplitude - ratio of boson peak and fast process for strong glass formers .",
    "however , at least near @xmath6 this ratio , e.g. measured by comparing boson - peak and minimum amplitude in fig .",

    "@xmath206 k for glycerol , the fast @xmath136-process in pc has indeed a higher amplitude if curves with similar values of @xmath2 are compared .",
    "this fact also explains the good fits with mct up to the boson peak frequency ( section [ secdiscfastmin ] ) in pc .",
    "however , for lower temperatures the different characteristics of pc and glycerol has to be ascribed either to a more shallow left wing of the boson peak for pc ( @xmath207 instead of @xmath208 ) or to a steeper increase of the high frequency wing of the minimum , thereby obscuring the steeper boson peak wing .",
    "interestingly , while there might be some problems for the new model by novikov @xcite in explaining the pc results ( see section [ secdiscfastmin ] ) , glycerol seems to fit into this picture : below the boson peak , two distinct regions are seen which can be ascribed to the relaxation - like and the main part of the vibrational excitations . concerning mct , it has to be mentioned that the light scattering results on glycerol @xcite exhibit quite similar characteristics as the dielectric results @xcite .",
    "the light scattering results were successfully described using the schematic two - correlator mct model mentioned above @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear if mct is able to provide an explanation for the qualitative difference of the glycerol and pc dielectric data .",
    "dielectric data on glass - forming pc in an exceptionally broad frequency range have been presented and compared with the results from light scattering and to broadband dielectric results on glycerol . a comparison of the findings concerning @xmath0-relaxation , excess wing , @xmath72-minimum , and boson peak on various theoretical and phenomenological predictions has been performed .",

    "the excess wing in pc was shown to follow the modified nagel scaling proposed by dendzik et al . @xcite but at high frequencies the curves of pc and glycerol do not scale onto each other .",

    "is detected . in this region",
    ", clearly fast processes contribute to the dielectric loss , a finding for which most models provide no explanation .",
    "while the minimum can be well described by the sum of power laws and a constant loss contribution @xcite , the theoretical foundation for these contributions is unclear at present but currently is being developed .",
    "in contrast , mct provides a microscopic explanation for the high - frequency data , at least at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , the analysis within mct yields values for @xmath97 and @xmath171 , that are in agreement with those determined from other experimental methods .",
    "also the differences in the susceptibilities obtained from dielectric and light scattering experiments seem to be in accord with recent extensions of mct . at low temperatures , @xmath209 @xmath97 , at least a qualitative agreement of the results ( presence of a fast process and possible occurrence of a  knee  ) with mct",
    "can be stated , but more work is needed for a quantitative comparison .",
    "overall , certain aspects of the results found in the present work can be explained by different models , but in our judgement mct provides the most consistent picture providing explanations for the largest variety of experimental facts , including the high - frequency processes .",
    "this may be partly due to the large amount of predictions made by mct , covering almost all aspects of the dynamic response of glass - forming materials , while other models are somewhat restricted in this respect .",
    "however , just this agreement of the data with the many different predictions of mct speaks in favor of the theory .",
    "admittedly , it is not possible to arrive at a final decisive conclusion concerning the applicability of mct for pc and alternative explanations may be possible .",
    "also many questions need to be solved , e.g. the behavior below @xmath97 should be compared with the extended mct , the differences to the scattering results should be compared quantitatively to mct ( considering orientational degrees of freedom of dipolar , non - spherical molecules ) , and the qualitatively different behavior of pc and glycerol in the boson peak region should be addressed .",
    "finally , in the boson peak region we find significant differences between glycerol and pc which wait for a theoretical explanation . but",
    "also more experimental work is needed , e.g. concerning the temperature evolution of the boson peak and a higher precision of the data at low temperatures in order to investigate in detail the possible occurrence of a knee in @xmath9 of pc .    we gratefully acknowledge stimulating discussion with c.a .",

    "<S> dielectric spectroscopy covering more than 18 decades of frequency has been performed on propylene carbonate in its liquid and supercooled - liquid state . using quasi - optic submillimeter and far - infrared spectroscopy the dielectric response </S>",
    "<S> was investigated up to frequencies well into the microscopic regime . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the @xmath0-process whose characteristic timescale is observed over 14 decades of frequency and the excess wing showing up at frequencies some three decades above the peak frequency . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is given to the high - frequency response of the dielectric loss in the crossover regime between @xmath0-peak and boson - peak . </S>",
    "<S> similar to our previous results in other glass forming materials we find evidence for additional processes in the crossover regime </S>",
    "<S> . however , significant differences concerning the spectral form at high frequencies are found . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to the susceptibilities obtained from light scattering and to the predictions of various models of the glass transition . </S>"
