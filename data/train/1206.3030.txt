    "note that the leptonic factor strongly weights the low-@xmath16 region of this integral , with 90% coming from the region @xmath118",

    "the error here includes our estimate of the uncertainties associated with higher - order effects , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "however we note that largest single uncertainty comes from the value for @xmath15 , which appears both as an overall factor in @xmath56 and in the mass parameter @xmath101 , as given by eq .",

    "our result for @xmath120 is more than twice that obtained by pachucki @xcite .",
    "most of the difference is due to the modern value for @xmath15 , which is about twice the one used in that work .",
    "there is also a further @xmath121% increase from the use of the form factor with the correct asymptotic form .",
    "our result is smaller that the one of carlson and vanderhaeghen @xcite who used a similar value for @xmath15 as ours but whose model form factor leads to @xmath13 growing like @xmath122 asymptotically .    finally , to estimate the total two - photon exchange contribution to the lamb shift , we add in the",

    "we use the updated numerical results from carlson and vanderhaeghen @xcite and , for consistency with the definition of @xmath15 , we reinstate the  non - pole \" born piece .",
    "the latter gives about 4.8  @xmath123ev for the form factor of ref .",
    "@xcite and so is comparable in importance to the subtraction term .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty are @xmath15 in our subtraction term above and the dependence of the elastic contribution on the choice of parametrisation of the proton form factors ( which we take as @xmath124  @xmath123ev , based on the results in ref .",
    "the bottom line for the energy is @xmath125 which is not significantly different from the values of about @xmath126  @xmath123ev obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite but which does not rely on a model for the form factor in @xmath56 .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the v@xmath4cs amplitude @xmath13 at fourth order in hbchpt , and including contributions of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "our result provides a model - independent constraint on the low - momentum form of the structure part of this amplitude .",
    "since the contribution of this amplitude to the lamb shift is dominated by the low - momentum region , this can significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainty in contribution of the polarisability of the proton to the lamb shift , which has been the subject of some recent debate @xcite .",
    "when our amplitude is matched smoothly onto the high-@xmath16 behaviour expected in the partonic regime @xcite , we obtain a contribution to the lamb shift that , perhaps unsurprisingly , is similar in magnitude to previous , more model - dependent determinations @xcite .",
    "in reaching our result we have re - examined the lets for v@xmath4cs and how they are embodied in effective field theories .",
    "the constraints of covariance , gauge invariance and crossing symmetry as well as lack of kinematic singularities mean that the only structure terms of order @xmath16 are given by the electric and magnetic polarisabilities .",
    "this is reflected by the appearance in fourth - order effective lagrangians of only two types of seagull term with adjustable coefficients , corresponding to the two polarisabilities .",
    "these lagrangians do contain other seagull terms at this order , but these all have coefficents that are fixed by the requirements of covariance . in particular , there is one that contributes to @xmath13 at order @xmath16 , but only through the  non - pole \" piece of the born amplitude .",
    "it is important keep this term in the born amplitude , rather than subsuming it into the structure part @xcite , as otherwise the magnetic polarisability in the let eq .",
    "( [ eq : let1 ] ) will not correspond to its conventional definition .",
    "our results leave no room for any large additional polarisability effect arising from off - shell form factors , as suggested by miller et al .",
    "the form factor appearing in @xmath56 falls off with @xmath16 and its mass parameter has a natural size for a pion - loop effect .",
    "we see no sign of any rapid growth at low @xmath16 that could lead to a large contribution to the lamb shift .",
    "there is thus no evidence that effects of proton polarisability can explain the difference between the proton charge radius as recently determined from the muonic lamb shift @xcite and that obtained from other experiments @xcite .",
