    "electrified automobile power chain technology faces a rapid development .",
    "the interest for this technology arises as an increasing number of automakers wish to adopt vehicles with an electrification of the power chain as a viable solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide to meet stringer regulative legislation and consumers demand .",
    "there is an effort of major constructors to deploy fully electric vehicles ( evs ) as early as possible in some car market segments .",
    "this work focuses on a specific class of hybrid electric vehicles , namely , range extender electric vehicles ( reev ) .",
    "the range extender electric vehicle model consists of a small dimensioned internal combustion engine ( ice ) as an extra energy source acting as a range extender in addition to the main energy source , namely , a dc battery .",
    "the two energy sources are assembled as in a series hybrid electric vehicle , which means that the ice is not connected mechanically to the drive shaft .",
    "instead , a generator transforms the mechanical energy produced in the ice into electric energy that can be directed towards the electric motor or the battery . because of the relative low power of the ice",
    ", this configuration does not allow the vehicle to rely solely on the range extender and thus the vehicle can not assure traction if there is no energy in the battery .",
    "although our controllers have to take into account the particularities of this class of hybrid vehicles , the formulation developed in this study is general enough and may be adapted to other architectures , including series and parallel hybrid electric vehicles .",
    "the goal of this work is compute a way of operating the range extender to enable the vehicle to reach its maximum range .",
    "the reev is modeled as a discrete - time dynamical system in which the state vector represents the energy capacities of the two different energy sources . in this",
    "setting , the study aims at finding the control sequence of the two energy sources that allows the vehicle to reach the furthest possible point of a given route or to reach the driver selected energy state .    to the extent of our knowledge ,",
    "there are no studies considering the driving range of the vehicle as an optimization criterion . usually , in the context of power management strategies the optimality of a strategy",
    "is defined in terms of the total fuel consumption during a driving cycle .",
    "we refer here to @xcite .",
    "different techniques are used in each of these works , as well as different assumption on whether one has access to _ a priori _ driving information .",
    "a common feature of the works above is the fact that the power management synthesis uses a predetermined _ driving range _",
    ", typically given as one considers a particular driving cycle .",
    "the main idea in our work is to have no _ a priori _ information about the vehicle driving range .",
    "a typical setting is when the driving cycle is too long to be completed with the current energy on - board the vehicle . in the case where no power management strategy can ensure the cycle completion",
    ", the utilization of a fuel consumption criteria does not seem to lead to well - posed posed optimal control problem .",
    "for instance , dynamic programming - based algorithms can not be implemented , since they rely on a backward computation of the value function starting from the `` last '' reachable point on the route which may be unknown .",
    "this work proposes a method to synthesize a power management strategy that maximizes the driving range on a cycle supposedly too long to be completed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : firstly , it describes the reev model motivating the study and states the associated hybrid optimal control problem .",
    "then , the reachable set and the value function are defined and a dynamic programming principle for the value function is obtained .",
    "it follows that the dynamic programming principle is used to derive an dynamic programming algorithm to compute the value function thus characterizing the reachable set of the system .",
    "lastly results of numerical simulations evaluating the autonomy both of a reev toy and a realistic model are presented .",
    "this section discusses the model of the power management system of a reev that is to be optimized and introduces the notation used throughout the document .",
    "a reev is a vehicle that combines a primary power source - a hv battery - and a small dimensioned ( powerwise ) secondary power source - in our case an ice .",
    "the traction ( or propulsion ) of the vehicle is performed by an electric motor connected to the vehicle s wheels through a reduction gear .",
    "both energy sources can supply some share of the necessary power to meet the driver demand .",
    "additionally , since the model considers a range - extender electric vehicle type , it can not rely solely on the re power to drive the vehicle .",
    "thus , the model considers that the vehicle s traction capability is conditioned to the existence of some electric energy in the battery .",
    "the architecture is that of a series hybrid electric vehicle , which means that the ice is not mechanically connected to the transmission .",
    "instead , a generator transforms the mechanical energy produced in the ice into electric current that can be directed towards the electric motor or charge the battery .",
    "the ice state is controlled by a discrete sequence of switching orders .",
    "an important feature of the reev model is a _ time lag _",
    "@xmath0 imposed between two consecutive decisions times . from the physical viewpoint",
    ", this assumption incorporates the fact that frequent switching of the re is undesirable in order to avoid mechanical wear off and acoustic nuisance for the driver .",
    "this lag has an order of magnitude of about @xmath1s .",
    "the controlled variables are the state of charge ( soc ) of the battery , the remaining fuel on the ice reservoir and the ice state on or off .",
    "this setting considers that the optimal power management strategy is synthesized for a specific trip . in this direction",
    ", we assume that information about the vehicle s future power demand is known .",
    "in particular , it is assumed that the vehicle future speed , i.e. the speed profile of the vehicle , as well as the relief of the route followed by the vehicle are known . as a consequence",
    ", the problem can be stated in a deterministic setting .",
    "this may seem a very strong assumption .",
    "however , range extender electric vehicles are expected to be equipped with embedded navigation systems ( nav ) that actually have information about expected speeds and topological data .",
    "this information can be exploited in order to construct an expected speed profile with a certain degree of confidence .    in the following of the paper ,",
    "index @xmath2 shall index a position in the route . since the vehicle speed is assumed to be known , on",
    "can easily obtain , from a known location @xmath3 , the time to attain it .",
    "more precisely , denote by @xmath4 the distance between points @xmath5 and @xmath3 and @xmath6 the ( constant ) vehicle speed between points @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "the total time to drive between @xmath5 and @xmath3 is then simply @xmath7 .",
    "the state vector is composed of the vehicle energy state and the ice state .",
    "the vehicle energy state is a two - dimensional vector @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the state of charge of the battery and the fuel available in the range extender module respectively .",
    "each of these quantities are the image of the remaining energy in the battery and in the re respectively . moreover , because energy capacities of the battery and the fuel tank are limited ( and normalized between @xmath10  full reservoir  and @xmath11  empty reservoir ) , the set of admissible states",
    "is defined as @xmath12 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "remark that we define the state space as all the plane @xmath13 and introduce a set of admissible states @xmath14 .",
    "the set @xmath14 represents the `` physically admissible '' soc and fuel levels , considering that they are normalized capacities .",
    "this is a modeling choice that later enables us to deal easily with the state constraints in the dynamic programming principle ( in opposition to imposing `` hard '' constraints on the state space like @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] ) .",
    "the re state is denoted by @xmath16 and indicates whether the re is off ( @xmath17 ) or on ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the control variables are the output power of the ice and the order to switch the ice s state ( on or off ) .",
    "the first is referred to as the continuous control and the latter as the discrete ( or switch ) control .",
    "the continuous control is applied at all points @xmath19 of the route and is denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the idea is that at each point @xmath3 , also called the decision stages , the controller is able to control the power split of the vehicle . indeed , in a series architecture the power split is controlled only by setting the output power of the range extender .",
    "that is because , for a given required power at the wheel @xmath21 , imposed by the driver , once the range extender output power @xmath22 is chosen the remaining required power @xmath23 is automatically supplied by the battery .",
    "the discrete control @xmath24 is a sequence of switching decisions @xmath25 , where for all @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the sequence of switch controls @xmath29 ( designating the new mode of operation of the ice ) is associated with the sequence of switching positions @xmath30 so that each decision @xmath31 is exerted at node @xmath32 .",
    "the set @xmath33 is a set value function of the actual discrete state and contains all possible new discrete states . in the vehicle application , where there are only two discrete modes of operation ( on or off ) , this set is simply @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the switching decision is introduced so one is able to stop the range extender whenever there are large idle periods , thus saving fuel .",
    "more precisely , if the ice is running and no output power is required , there is still an idle fuel consumption , as energy is required to keep the engine running to avoid stalling . in the case of",
    "extended idle periods , it may be worth to stop the ice and pay a fuel overhead to restart the engine whenever needed .",
    "the switch lag condition imposes that two consecutive switch decisions must be separated by a time interval of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37    given a discrete control sequence @xmath24 and a discrete state @xmath38 , the continuous control steers the state according to @xmath39 and at isolated points @xmath40 , the discrete state changes according to @xmath41 these expressions mean that : given a discrete control sequence @xmath24 , let @xmath38 be a mode of operation activated at some point @xmath42 .",
    "then , the dynamic @xmath43 operates on the state between points @xmath44 and the trajectory of the discrete state is simply @xmath45 for @xmath3 between @xmath42 and @xmath32 .",
    "when point @xmath32 is reached , the discrete dynamics undergoes a switch associated with the switch control @xmath31 and changes to @xmath46 , activating the new mode of operation given by @xmath47 .",
    "observe moreover that the process is modeled and described in backward fashion .    at this point ,",
    "we introduce the notion of hybrid control and admissible hybrid control .",
    "the hybrid control is introduced for notational convenience .",
    "it is a control regrouping both the range extender power @xmath22 and the switch decision @xmath24 .",
    "more in detail , given a discrete control sequence @xmath25 and a continuous control sequence @xmath48 , the hybrid control is denoted by @xmath49 and groups the continuous and discrete controls .",
    "denote by @xmath50 the set of all hybrid controls .",
    "as mentioned , the hybrid control @xmath51 must contain controls @xmath52 such that @xmath20 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , the admissibility of each discrete and continuous control does not imply the admissibility of the hybrid control without additional structural conditions . by structural conditions we refer to the fact that the decision nodes @xmath32 must be increasing with @xmath54 and that the associated decision times must respect the lag condition .",
    "the structure imposed on the admissible hybrid controls @xmath55 allows the system to engender admissible trajectories .",
    "an admissible trajectory can be regarded as a `` physically '' admissible trajectory .",
    "such trajectories correspond to the evolution of the soc and fuel levels whenever the system is steered by an admissible control sequence .",
    "however , the hybrid control admissibility condition is not well adapted to a dynamic programming principle formulation , needed later on . in order to include the admissibility condition in the optimal control problem in a more suitable form ,",
    "we introduce a new state variable @xmath56 . recall that the decision lag condition implies that new switch orders are not available until a time @xmath57 after the latest switch .",
    "the new variable is constructed such that , at a given position @xmath3 , the value @xmath58 measures the time since the last switch .",
    "the idea is to translate the structural conditions into conditions satisfied by this new variable and treat them as state constraints .",
    "thus , if @xmath59 all switch decisions are blocked and if , conversely , @xmath60 the system is free to switch .",
    "for that reason , this variable can be seen as a switch lock .",
    "now , given @xmath61 , @xmath62 , a discrete control sequence @xmath24 , final conditions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the hybrid dynamical system is written as @xmath65    indeed , once the discrete control is given , the trajectory @xmath58 can be determined . proceeding with the idea of adapting the admissibility condition",
    "we wish to consider @xmath66 , with @xmath67 $ ] , where @xmath68 is the total travel time , the final value of the switch lock variable trajectory and impose the delay condition under the form @xmath69 for all @xmath32 ( notice that @xmath70 by construction ) . proceeding as such",
    ", these conditions suffice to define an admissible discrete control set .",
    "so , while optimizing with respect to admissible functions , one needs only look within the set of hybrid controls that engender a trajectory @xmath58 with an appropriate structure .",
    "denote the solutions of - with final conditions @xmath71 by @xmath72,@xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "given @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , define the admissible trajectory set @xmath77 as @xmath78      let @xmath79 be the set of allowed initial states , i.e. the set of states from which the system - is allowed to start .",
    "define the reachable set as the set of all points attainable by @xmath80 after driving until point @xmath3 starting within the set of allowed initial states @xmath81 to be @xmath82    in other words , the reachable set @xmath83 contains the values of the final energy state @xmath84 , regardless of @xmath85 at point @xmath3 , for all admissible trajectories ",
    "i.e. , trajectories obtained through an admissible hybrid control  starting within the set of possible initial states @xmath81 that never leave set @xmath14 . in particular",
    ", the information contained in allows one to determine the first point where the reachable set is empty .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath79 , define @xmath86 to be @xmath87 the position is identified as the _ autonomy _ of the hybrid system - .",
    "indeed , one can readily see that if no more admissible energy states are attainable after @xmath88 , any admissible trajectory must leave set @xmath14 of admissible values beyond this time .",
    "therefore , @xmath88 is interpreted as the last point in the path in which there is some usable energy on - board the vehicle .    in the case of range",
    "extender electric vehicles , the vehicle stops operating in nominal mode when the battery is depleted , even if there is some fuel left in the tank .",
    "if the driving conditions allows all the fuel to be consumed , then the last reachable energy state of the vehicle is the state @xmath89 , where there is no charge in the battery and no fuel in the tank .",
    "however , this is by all means the sole last reachable energetic state in all situations . indeed , because the range extender is power - wise small dimensioned , it may be the case that the engine can not consume energy quickly enough to empty the fuel tank . for instance , if the vehicle is driving through a steep slope , the battery may be depleted before all the fuel is consumed resulting thus in a final state @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the reachable set @xmath92 is associated with a _ minimum time function _ @xmath93 , defined as    @xmath94    the minimum time function associated to a point @xmath95 in the state space is the minimum time that any admissible trajectory needs to reach @xmath95 departing from set @xmath81 while respecting the state constraints @xmath14 .      in order to characterize the reachable set",
    "@xmath83 this paper follows the classic level - set approach @xcite . the idea is to describe as the negative region of a function @xmath96 .",
    "it is well known that the function @xmath96 can be defined as the value function of some optimal control problem . in the case of system - , @xmath96 happens to be the value function of a ( discrete time ) hybrid optimal control problem .",
    "consider a lipschitz continuous function @xmath97 such that @xmath98 such a function always exists  for instance , the signed distance function @xmath99 from the set @xmath100 .",
    "for a given point @xmath101 and hybrid state vector @xmath102 , define the value function to be @xmath103 observe that works as a level - set to the negative part of .",
    "indeed , since contains only admissible trajectories that remain in @xmath14 , by implies that @xmath104 is negative if and only if @xmath105 is inside @xmath81 , which in turn implies that @xmath106 .",
    "now we proceed to describe the state constraints in the similar manner .",
    "the set @xmath107 of state constraints is treated as an _ obstacle _ in the state space , i.e. , the state trajectory can not pass through the obstacle set @xmath14 .",
    "we recall that @xmath108 ^ 2 $ ] is the normalized soc and fuel quantities . more precisely ,",
    "define a lipschitz continuous function @xmath109 to be @xmath110 then , for a given @xmath101 and @xmath102 , define a total penalization function to be @xmath111 and then , the optimal value : @xmath112 here and in the rest of the paper , we denote @xmath113 .",
    "the next proposition certifies that is indeed a level - set of and .",
    "[ levelset ] let @xmath79 .",
    "define functions @xmath114 et @xmath115 respectively by and .",

    "then , for @xmath117 , the reachable set is given by @xmath118    proposition sets the equivalence between and the negative regions of and .",
    "in particular , it states that it suffices to computes @xmath96 or @xmath119 in order to obtain information about @xmath120 . in this sense , this paper focuses on , which is associated with an optimal control problem with no state constraints .",
    "the value function can also be used to characterize the minimum time function .",
    "in addition to the minimum function , the next proposition introduces the _ extended minimum time function _ , which takes into account all state variables @xmath71 . this extended function is needed later to the controller synthesis .",
    "[ mintimeandvaluefunction ] the minimum time function @xmath121 is given by @xmath122 the _ extended _ minimum time function @xmath123 is given by @xmath124    observe that equation is an immediate consequence of the level set identities in proposition [ levelset ] .",

    "once the value function is obtained , one can synthesize a controller using the minimum time function @xmath138 .",
    "the computation of the value function and the subsequent controller synthesis are obtained in a classic fashion by a dynamic programming algorithm .",

    "proposition [ dynprinciple ] ) over a grid @xmath139 of the discretized state space .",
    "the dynamic programming algorithm outputs a controller @xmath140 that controls the range extender power output and its mode of operation to reach the destination point after a time @xmath141 such that the final state is @xmath142 departing from a state in @xmath81 .",
    "additionally , the trajectory remains inside set @xmath14 , which in our case amounts to respect the fuel and soc capacities .",
    "one can observe that the extended minimum time function plays a major role in the synthesis of the controller . indeed ,",
    "the value function numerical values have no physical meaning since the obstacle and target functions @xmath114 and @xmath115 are arbitrary .",
    "only the sign of the value function is needed to determine the reachable set . instead",
    ", the physical information is encoded in the minimum time function .",
    "proposition [ dynprinciple ] provides the expressions that allow the computation through a dynamic programming algorithm .",

    "first , a simple vehicle model is used in the simulations .",
    "in addition , a constant vehicle speed is assumed during this first simulation phase .",
    "this model allows an analytic evaluation of the autonomy and is suitable for an a posteriori verification of the results .",
    "after the algorithm is tested using this simple configuration , we introduce a realistic vehicle model and a realistic speed profile .    in this simple setting , we assume that the vehicle follows a constant speed of @xmath143 m/s and the distance between any two points @xmath5 and @xmath3 is @xmath144 m . we consider that @xmath13 and @xmath145 . the switch dynamics are given simply by @xmath146 ensuring that @xmath24 imposes the new mode of operation at every switching time .",

    "the coefficient @xmath150 models a non - negative power requirement throughout the driving cycle and therefore , a non - negative soc consumption .",
