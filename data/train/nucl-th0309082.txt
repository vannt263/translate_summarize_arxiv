    "the concept of the phase transition of the mean field is useful for describing structure changes in the atomic nucleus although it is a quantum system composed of finite number of fermions .",
    "typical example is that a spherical mean field becomes unstable as the quadrupole vibration excited on top of it softens with changing particle numbers , then an axially symmetric mean field substitutes .",
    "this can rotate about one of the axes perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "consecutively , the axial symmetric mean field can become unstable as the @xmath2 vibration softens , then a triaxially deformed mean field substitutes .",
    "this can rotate about all the three principal axes . usually , however , a rotation about one axis dominates because the rotation about the axis with the largest moment of inertia is energetically favorable .",
    "when some excitation energy is supplied , small rotations about other two axes become possible .",
    "consequently this produces a kind of vibrational motion of the rotational axis , that is , the wobbling motion .",
    "the small amplitude wobbling motion at high spins was first discussed by bohr and mottelson  @xcite in terms of a macroscopic rotor model .",
    "then it was studied microscopically by janssen and mikhailov  @xcite and marshalek  @xcite in terms of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . since the small amplitude wobbling mode has the same quantum number , parity @xmath3 and signature @xmath4 , as the odd - spin member of the @xmath2 vibrational band , mikhailov and janssen  @xcite anticipated that it would appear as a high - spin continuation of the odd - spin @xmath2 band .",
    "but it has not been clear in which nuclei , at what spins , and with what shapes it would appear .",
    "using the rpa , shimizu and matsuyanagi  @xcite studied er isotopes with small @xmath5 , matsuzaki  @xcite and shimizu and matsuzaki  @xcite studied @xmath6os with a rather large negative @xmath2 but their correspondence to the experimental data was not very clear . in 2001 , degrd _ et al . _",

    "the possibility of this phase transition was discussed in terms of the harmonic oscillator model by cuypers  @xcite and heiss and nazmitdinov  @xcite but their conclusions are controversial . a theoretical framework to describe three - dimensional rotations , possibly with large amplitude ,",
    "was first devised by kerman and onishi  @xcite within a time - dependent variational formalism .",

    "the one - body hamiltonian is given by eqs.([hcr ] )  ( [ hnil ] ) with @xmath48 pairing correlation is taken into the system by a simple bcs approximation with fixed gaps as in the case of the one - dimensional cranking .",
    "the expectation value @xmath49 calculated at each @xmath50 has three non - zero components in general ; the stationary state that minimizes the total routhian is obtained by requiring @xmath51 ( see ref .",

    "given a set of mean - field parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath17 , @xmath2 , and @xmath18 , a configuration is specified at @xmath54 ( principal axis cranking about the @xmath22 axis ) . then by changing @xmath55 and @xmath56 step by step , the most overlapped state is chased .",

    "[ fig1 ] . the behavior of @xmath72 in fig .  [ fig1](b ) can be interpreted as that , when the system can fluctuate to the direction of the @xmath73 axis without any energy cost , it does not fluctuate to the @xmath23 axis .",

    "to summarize , we have proved that a tilted axis rotation emerges when the wobbling mode becomes unstable as the triaxiality parameter changes in an oblate configuration in @xmath58gd .",
    "its instability is caused by a growth of the fluctuation of the motion of the angular momentum or frequency vector to the direction of the @xmath73 axis .",
    "having performed this theoretical calculation , we have argued that the signature of the softening of the wobbling motion can be seen in the observed spectra of the triaxial superdeformation in @xmath1lu and shown that a tilted axis minimum would appear if it were not for the @xmath96 quasiparticle ."
