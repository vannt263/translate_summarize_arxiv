    "a three - dimensional object that can not be superimposed on its mirror image is said to be chiral , these distinct mirror images are called enantiomers .",
    "spectroscopically , enantiomers have identical properties and distinguishing between the two is not trivial .",
    "the characteristic feature of chiral objects is the manner of their interactions with other chiral objects .",
    "for example , the refractive indices of left- and right - handed circularly polarised light are different in a chiral medium , therefore the two polarisations will propagate at different speeds .",
    "the difference in velocity is related to the phenomenon of circular dichroism , where the wave with the ` slower ' polarisation is absorbed more strongly as it travels through the medium @xcite .",
    "many of the processes crucial to life involve chiral molecules whose chiral identity plays a central role in their chemical reactions , the incorrect enantiomer reacting differently and not producing the required result . in nature",
    "these molecules only occur as one enantiomer and are not found as the other , thus the reactions only occur when the correct enantiomer is present . in contrast , artificial production creates both enantiomers in equal proportions .",
    "therefore it is important to be able to distinguish between enantiomers and ultimately to be able to separate a racemic ( containing both enantiomers ) mixture into an enantiomerically pure sample .    a frequently used method to separate enantiomers in an industrial setting is chiral chromotography .",
    "the initial racemic solution is passed through a column packed with a resolving agent , which is usually an enzyme and by necessity has to be chiral .",
    "this either retards , or stops , the progress of one of the enantiomers passing through the column but crucially not for the other and thus allows the solution to be separated . from an optical viewpoint",
    "it has been proposed that a racemic sample can be purified by use of coordinated laser pulses , which use a two - step process to initially drive different transitions in the enantiomers before converting one into the other @xcite .",
    "it has recently been calculated that in the presence of a chiral carbon nanotube the enantiomers of alanine possess different absorption energies and it was theorised that this could lead to a method of discrimination @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the van der waals dispersion force between molecules can be enantiomer selective @xcite . here",
    "we propose the use of another dispersion force , the casimir - polder force @xcite , as a method of distinguishing and ultimately separating enantiomers .",
    "casimir - polder forces occur due to fluctuations in the quantum vacuum between objects , in this case it is between a particle and a macroscopic body .",
    "this force can be decomposed into an electric component that is solely dependent upon the electric dipole moments of the particle , the magnetic component of the force is likewise defined .",
    "we show that there is a third component that depends upon an interaction of the molecule s electric and magnetic dipole moments and this describes the particles chiral response in the chiral component of the casimir - polder force . for the purpose of discrimination",
    ", the force on enantiomers must be different , this means that a chiral medium is required to produce the chiral - selective behaviour .",
    "chiral molecules occur frequently in nature and there has been much work to calculate the relevant transition values either ab initio @xcite , or through a twisted arc model for simple chiral molecules @xcite .",
    "recent technological developments have allowed for the creation of chiral fullerenes such as c@xmath0 @xcite , chiral carbon nanotubes @xcite and chiral meta - materials @xcite .",
    "chiral meta - materials can be made from structures such as a gold helix @xcite , which shows a broadband electromagnetic response ; a woodpile structure @xcite , a gold bar construction @xcite , which exhibit a negative refractive index in certain frequency ranges ; and gold dots , @xcite which can be tuned during construction to give a desired response .",
    "recently it has been shown that superchiral electromagnetic fields @xcite can arise in planar chiral metamaterials .",
    "these fields can generate a much larger dissymmetry between the effective refractive indices for adsorbed chiral molecules on left- and right - handed materials than circularly polarised light and a solution of chiral molecules @xcite .",
    "chiral metamaterials have also been proposed as a method of producing repulsive casimir forces @xcite .    in this article",
    "we derive the chiral component of the casimir - polder potential within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "we show that inherent to this potential is the requirement that the particle and the medium both exhibit a chiral response .",
    "the theory is applied to the case of a chiral molecule in a cavity between two chiral metamaterials in the non - retarded limit , where we show a possible route towards enantiomer separation .",
    "the article is organised as follows . the quantised description of a chiral medium is given in section [ secchiral ] , followed by the derivation of the chiral component of the casimir - polder force in section [ seccpchiral ] .",
    "this is applied to the case of a chiral molecule near a boundary ; a perfect chiral mirror is considered in section [ secperfect ] and a chiral metamaterial in section [ secmeta ] .",
    "we illustrate the theory by examining a chiral molecule in a cavity made of chiral metamaterials , considering a molecule initially in the ground state in section [ secground ] and initially in an excited state in section [ secexcited ] .",
    "we provide some concluding remarks in section [ secconclusion ] .",
    "in order to derive the chiral component of the casimir - polder potential in a general form , field quantisation in an absorbing chiral medium is required .",
    "this quantisation is the basis for describing the electric and magnetic fields and the subsequent formulation of an important integral relation , which is needed for the calculation of the casimir - polder potential .",
    "the constitutive relations for the electromagnetic fields in the presence of a classical , non - dissipative chiral medium are given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the relative permittivity and permeability tensors and @xmath5 is the chirality tensor , a magnetoelectric susceptibility .",
    "the chiral susceptibility of the medium has the effect of ` rotating ' a magnetic effect to contribute towards an electric response and vice versa .",
    "the @xmath6 is a notational shorthand for a spatial convolution , i.e. , @xmath7(\\mathbf{r } , \\mathbf{r } ' ) = \\int \\mathrm{d}^{3}\\mathbf{s}\\ \\bm{x}(\\mathbf{r } , \\mathbf{s}){\\!\\cdot\\!}\\bm{y}(\\mathbf{s } , \\mathbf{r}')$ ] . for nonlocally",

    "when the molecule is in the centre ( i.e. equal distance from both halfspaces ) , the electric components of the casimir - polder force cancel and the net contribution to the total casimir - polder force is zero . it should be noted that the difference in the chirality of the halfspaces does not effect the electric force from either halfspace and hence the combined electric component of the total force .    by looking at the chiral component of the casimir - polder force ( figure [ figchircpforce ] ) one obtains an attractive force between the chiral molecule and one of the halfspaces ( to the left hand side ) and a repulsive force between the chiral molecule and the other halfspace ( to the right hand side ) .",

    "looking at the chiral medium , the chirality is slightly smaller than the permittivity , but this difference is enhanced by the structure of the reflection coefficients .      in order to overcome the dominance of the electric dipole force , it is helpful to consider other molecular initial states . if the molecule is initially in an excited state the resonant contribution to the force needs to be considered . in this scenario ,",

    "can be separated from its enantiomer .",
    "this is because the suppression of the electric component of the casimir - polder force allows the chiral component of the force to attract an enantiomer to the corresponding halfspace while it is being repelled from the opposite halfspace without the electric component dominating .    as a proof of principle the metamaterials parameters are chosen as suitable multiples of the plasma frequency and",

    "the inset in the bottom right shows a magnification of the centre region between @xmath174 nm and @xmath175 nm . ]",
    "the results are shown in figure [ figresonances ] . as can be seen , for a particular transition",
    "frequency a suppression of the electric component of the casimir - polder force sufficient to allow enantiomer separation can be obtained .",
    "the chiral component is the dominant contribution in the central region ( @xmath176 ) of the cavity ( see the inset to figure [ figresonances ] ) , meaning that the direction of the force acting on a chiral molecule in this region will be dependent on its chirality .",
    "therefore enantiomers that pass at low speeds through the centre of the cavity will be attracted or repelled in opposite directions and will be separated based on their chirality . as the total electric component of the casimir - polder force is attractive , the separated enantiomers will continue to be drawn towards opposite halfspaces even when not in the central region .",
    "it is important to note that , although the chirality of the metamaterials has not changed , the chiral component of the casimir - polder force is now acting in the opposite direction .",
    "this is due to the resonant part of the chiral force , which is larger than the off - resonant part and acts against it .",
    "the chiral component of the casimir - polder potential has been derived within the framework of macroscopic qed .",
    "the results show that the medium and particle in question must both be chiral , otherwise this potential does not exist . furthermore , this potential is sensitive to the chirality of the objects in question and can be attractive or repulsive .    by initially considering a perfect chiral mirror , it was found that in the retarded limit the chiral component of the casimir - polder potential scales as @xmath177 with the molecule - surface distance whereas for the non - retarded limit the spatial scaling is @xmath178 . as already alluded to , it is unlikely that this could be realised in a real material , due to the requirement for perfect reflection _ and _ complete rotation of the incident wave polarisation .",
    "when the chiral medium does not exhibit perfect reflectance the chiral potential is slightly diminished and in the non - retarded limit the spatial scaling was found to be @xmath179 .    in the geometry where a chiral molecule , initially in the ground state , is located between two half spaces of opposite chirality it was found that the chiral component of the casimir - polder force is attractive towards one half space and repulsive from the other . however , the electric component of the casimir - polder force between the molecule and the half spaces dominates over the chiral component .",
    "therefore , in this geometry , it would not be possible to distinguish between enantiomers because the indiscriminate attractive electric force dominates over any chiral effects .",
    "if the molecule is initially in an excited state it was found that the material properties can be tuned such that the resonant contribution to the electric component of the casimir - polder force almost completely suppresses the off - resonant contribution .",
    "enantiomers in the centre between the halfspaces would then experience an overall force whose direction is dependent on the chiral identity of the molecule .",
    "this chiral force will draw the molecule towards a particular halfspace with its enantiomer attracted to the other side of the cavity .",
    "this distinction between enantiomers will allow them to be separated by the casimir - polder force .",
