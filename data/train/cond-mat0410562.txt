    "it has long been known that strongly correlated electronic systems at zero temperature can be parametrically close to fixed points with macroscopically degenerate ground state manifolds .",

    "@xcite similarly , the zero temperature phase diagram of a class of quantum dimer models and geometrically frustrated quantum systems are known to be influenced by fixed points with massively degenerate ground state manifolds .",

    "more specifically , we are going to construct a quantum version of the ( classical ) three - coloring model introduced by baxter in ref .   which we shall call the quantum three - coloring dimer model .",

    "this interplay between a quantum model and a classical stochastic model generalizes a similar connection established by henley for the square lattice quantum dimer model.@xcite ( iv ) the quantum three - coloring dimer model is _ local _ in that it can be interpreted as a hamiltonian for quantum spins whose interactions have a _",
