    "we introduce the following definitions .",
    "let @xmath0 be a plane triangulation with shedding sequence @xmath59 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath0 is embedded geometrically as in theorem  [ t : rational ] .",
    "proceeding recursively , we define a binary tree @xmath138 , such that the nodes of @xmath139 are edges of @xmath0 , and the edges of @xmath139 correspond to faces of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath140 denote the edge of @xmath0 containing vertices @xmath141 , and let @xmath142 be the tree consisting of the single node @xmath140 .",
    "now let @xmath143 , and let @xmath144 denote the boundary edges of @xmath58 immediately to the left and right of @xmath62 , respectively ( this is well defined because @xmath0 is embedded as in theorem  [ t : rational ] ) .",
    "assume that we have already constructed @xmath145 , and that all boundary edges of @xmath146 are nodes of @xmath145 .",
    "let @xmath147 be the boundary edges of @xmath146 such that @xmath148 shares a face with @xmath149 , and @xmath150 shares a face with @xmath151 .",

    "then clearly all boundary edges of @xmath58 are vertices of @xmath155 .",

    "24)@xmath175    a fundamental idea behind our integer grid embedding is that the reduced tree @xmath173 contains all of the critical information needed for carrying out the embedding of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for each @xmath176 , the vertex @xmath62 corresponds to an internal node of @xmath173 ( shown as large dots in figure  [ f : tree ] ) .",
    "thus the structure of @xmath173 tells us how to horizontally space the vertices @xmath62 with @xmath136 , and how to choose the slopes of the boundary edges adjacent to them . on the other hand ,",
    "when adding vertices @xmath62 with @xmath137 , our construction will have the property that the boundary slopes will be perturbed only slightly , and the horizontal distances between vertices will only increase .",

    "<S> we give a new proof of steinitz s classical theorem in the case of plane triangulations , which allows us to obtain a new general bound on the grid size of the simplicial polytope realizing a given triangulation , subexponential in a number of special cases .    </S>",
    "<S> formally , we prove that every plane triangulation @xmath0 with @xmath1 vertices can be embedded in  @xmath2 in such a way that it is the vertical projection of a convex polyhedral surface . </S>",
