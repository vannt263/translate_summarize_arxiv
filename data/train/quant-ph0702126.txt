    "conditional quantum operation based on photon detection plays an important role in recent optical quantum information processing .",
    "particularly , in the continuous variable regime , it is the only available tool with current technology to generate non - gaussian states from gaussian ones .",
    "a typical example is the ` photon subtraction ' operation , in which a nonclassical input state is split by a highly transmissive beamsplitter ( bs ) and the reflected state is measured by a photon number resolving detector ( pnrd ) . selecting the event that the detector observes photons , one obtains a non - gaussian transformation from the input to output quantum state .",
    "this type of conditional operation was formulated in @xcite .",
    "@xcite then showed that applying it to a squeezed vacuum , one can generate a non - gaussian state which is close to the superposition of coherent states with plus or minus phase @xmath0 with very high fidelity , where @xmath1 is a coherent state with the amplitude of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the normalization factor .",
    "recently , such state has been experimentally generated by a single photon subtraction from pulsed @xcite and cw @xcite squeezed vacua . in these experiments , since a reflected beam includes sufficiently small average number of photons ( @xmath4 ) , single photon detection was approximately realized by use of an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) which is often called as ` on / off ' type detector since it discriminates only a presence of photons instead of resolving photon numbers .",
    "the progress of these experiments promises the realizations of more complicated applications of photon subtraction proposed so far , including the improvement of quantum teleportation @xcite and entanglement - assisted coding @xcite , entanglement distillation @xcite , loophole free tests of bell s inequalities @xcite , and optical quantum computations in quadrature basis @xcite or superposed coherent state basis @xcite . in the last application , @xmath5 with appropriate @xmath2",
    "is required as an ancillary state . to prepare such ancillae ,",
    "the method to conditionally amplify @xmath2 with on / off detectors has been proposed @xcite .",
