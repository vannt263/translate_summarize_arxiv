    "kleinian groups , which are the discrete groups of orientation preserving isometries of hyperbolic space , have been studied for a number of years , and have been of particular interest since the work of thurston in the late 1970s on the geometrization of compact @xmath0manifolds .",
    "a kleinian group can be viewed either as an isolated , single group , or as one of a member of a family or continuum of groups .    in this note , we concentrate our attention on the latter scenario , which is the deformation theory of the title , and attempt to give a description of various of the more common families of kleinian groups which are considered when doing deformation theory .",
    "no proofs are given , though it is hoped that reasonable coverage of the current state of the subject is given , and that ample references have been given for the interested reader to venture boldly forth into the literature .",
    "it is possible to consider the questions raised here in much more general settings , for example for kleinian groups in @xmath1dimensions for general @xmath1 , but that is beyond the scope of what is attempted here",
    ". some material on this aspect of the question can be found in bowditch @xcite and the references contained therein .",
    "the author would like to thank dick canary , ed taylor , and brian bowditch for useful conversations during the preparation of this work , as well as the referee for useful comments .",
    "we begin by giving a few basic definitions of the objects considered in this note , namely kleinian groups .",
    "we go on to define and describe the basic structure of the deformation spaces we are considering herein .",
    "a _ kleinian group _ is a discrete subgroup of @xmath2 , which we view as acting both on the riemann sphere @xmath3 by mbius transformations and on real hyperbolic @xmath0space @xmath4 by isometries , where the two actions are linked by the poincar extension .",
    "the action of an infinite kleinian group @xmath5 partitions @xmath3 into two sets , the _ domain of discontinuity _ @xmath6 , which is the largest open subset of @xmath7 on which @xmath5 acts discontinuously , and the _ limit set _ @xmath8 . if @xmath8 contains two or fewer points , @xmath5 is _ elementary _ , otherwise @xmath5 is _ non - elementary_. for a non - elementary kleinian group @xmath5 , the limit set @xmath8 can also be described as the smallest non - empty closed subset of @xmath3 invariant under @xmath5 .",
    "we refer the reader to maskit @xcite or matsuzaki and taniguchi @xcite as a reference for the basics of kleinian groups .",
    "an isomorphism @xmath9 between kleinian groups @xmath5 and @xmath10 is _ type - preserving _ if , for @xmath11 , we have that @xmath12 is parabolic if and only if @xmath13 is parabolic .",
    "a kleinian group is _ convex cocompact _ if its convex core is compact ; recall that the _ convex core _ associated to a kleinian group @xmath5 is the minimal convex submanifold of @xmath14 whose inclusion is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "more generally , a kleinian group is _ geometrically finite _ if it is finitely generated and if its convex core has finite volume .",
    "this is one of several equivalent definitions of geometric finiteness ; the interested reader is referred to bowditch @xcite for a complete discussion .",
    "a kleinian group @xmath5 is _ topologically tame _ if its corresponding quotient @xmath0manifold @xmath14 is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact @xmath0manifold .",
    "geometrically finite kleinian groups are topologically tame .",
    "it was conjectured by marden @xcite that all finitely generated kleinian groups are topologically tame .",
    "a compact @xmath0manifold @xmath15 is _ hyperbolizable _ if there exists a hyperbolic @xmath0manifold @xmath16 homeomorphic to the interior of @xmath15 .",
    "note that a hyperbolizable @xmath0manifold @xmath15 is necessarily orientable ; _ irreducible _ , in that every embedded @xmath17sphere in @xmath15 bounds a @xmath0ball in @xmath15 ; and _ atoroidal _ , in that every embedded torus @xmath18 in @xmath15 is homotopic into @xmath19 . also , since the universal cover @xmath4 of @xmath20 is contractible , the fundamental group of @xmath15 is isomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "for a discussion of the basic theory of @xmath0manifolds , we refer the reader to hempel @xcite and jaco @xcite .    keeping to our viewpoint of a kleinian group as a member of a family of groups , throughout this survey",
    "we view a kleinian group as the image @xmath21 of a representation @xmath22 of a group @xmath23 into @xmath24 . unless explicitly stated otherwise , we assume that @xmath23 is finitely generated , torsion - free , and non - abelian , so that in particular @xmath21 is non - elementary .      the most basic of the deformation spaces is the _ representation variety _",
    "@xmath25 which is the space of all representations of @xmath23 into @xmath27 with the following topology . given a set of generators @xmath28 for @xmath23",
    ", we may naturally view @xmath25 as a subset of @xmath29 , where a representation @xmath30 corresponds to the @xmath31tuple @xmath32 in @xmath29 .",
    "the defining polynomials of this variety are determined by the relations in @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath23 is free , then @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath25 is a closed subset of @xmath29 .",
    "the representations in @xmath25 are _ unnormalized _ , in the sense that there is a natural free action of @xmath27 on @xmath25 by conjugation .",
    "depending on the particular question being addressed , it is sometimes preferable to remove the ambiguity of this action and form the quotient space @xmath34 .",
    "though a detailed description is beyond the scope of this survey , we pause here to mention work of culler and shalen @xcite , @xcite , in which a slight variant of the representation variety as defined above plays a fundamental role , and which has inspired further work of morgan and shalen @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and culler , gordon , luecke , and shalen @xcite .",
    "the basic object here is not the space @xmath35 of all representations of @xmath23 into @xmath27 as defined above , but instead the related space @xmath36 of all representations of @xmath23 into @xmath37 , modulo the action of @xmath37 .",
    "the introduction of this space @xmath36 does beg the question of when a representation of @xmath23 into @xmath38 can be lifted to a representation of @xmath23 into @xmath39 .",
    "we note in passing that this question of lifting representations has been considered by a number of authors , including culler , kra , and thurston , to name but a few ; we refer the reader to the article by kra @xcite for exact statements and a review of the history , including references .    by considering the global structure of the variety @xmath36 in the case that @xmath23 is the fundamental group of a compact , hyperbolizable @xmath0manifold @xmath15 , and in particular the ideal points of its compactification , culler and shalen @xcite are able to analyze the actions of @xmath23 on trees , which in turn has connections with the existence of essential incompressible surfaces in @xmath15 , finite group actions on @xmath15 , and has particular consequences in the case that @xmath15 is the complement of a knot in @xmath40 .",
    "we refer the reader to the excellent survey article by shalen @xcite , as well as to the papers cited above .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the subspace of @xmath25 consisting of those representations @xmath22 for which @xmath43 is parabolic if and only if @xmath44 lies in a rank two free abelian subgroup of @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to @xmath41 as the space of _ minimally parabolic _",
    "representations of @xmath23 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath23 contains no @xmath45 subgroups , then the image @xmath21 of every @xmath22 in @xmath41 is _ purely loxodromic _ , in that every non - trivial element of @xmath21 is loxodromic .",
    "set @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the subspace of @xmath25 consisting of the discrete , faithful representations of @xmath23 , that is , the injective homomorphisms of @xmath23 into @xmath27 with discrete image .",
    "for the purposes of this note , the space @xmath47 is our universe , as it is the space of all kleinian groups isomorphic to @xmath23 .",
    "set @xmath49 .",
    "we note that there exists an equivalent formulation of @xmath50 in terms of manifolds . given a hyperbolic @xmath0manifold @xmath20 , let @xmath51 denote the set of all pairs @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a hyperbolic @xmath0manifold and @xmath54 is a homotopy equivalence , modulo the equivalence relation @xmath55 if there exists an orientation preserving isometry @xmath56 so that @xmath57 is homotopic to @xmath44 .",
    "the topology on @xmath58 is given by noting that , if we let @xmath59 be a choice of conjugacy class of the fundamental group of @xmath20 , then each element @xmath52 in @xmath58 gives rise to a discrete , faithful representation @xmath60 of @xmath5 into @xmath38 , with equivalent points in @xmath58 giving rise to conjugate representations into @xmath27 .",
    "hence , equipping @xmath58 with this topology once again gives rise to @xmath50 with @xmath61 .",
    "the following theorem , due to jrgensen , describes the fundamental property of @xmath47 , namely that the limit of a sequence of elements of @xmath47 is again an element of @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath47 is a closed subset of @xmath25 .",
    "[ deformation - space - closed ]    there is one notable case in which @xmath50 is completely understood , namely in the case that @xmath23 is the fundamental group of a compact , hyperbolizable @xmath0manifold @xmath15 whose boundary is the union of a ( possibly empty ) collection of tori . in this case , the hyperbolic structure on the interior of @xmath15 is unique , by the classical rigidity theorem of mostow , for closed manifolds , and prasad , for manifolds with non - empty toroidal boundary . rephrasing this statement as a statement about deformation spaces yields the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 is the fundamental group of a compact , orientable @xmath0manifold @xmath15 whose boundary is the union of a ( possibly empty ) collection of tori .",
    "then , @xmath50 either is empty or consists of a single point . [ mostow - rigidity ]    given this result , it will cause us no loss of generality to assume that henceforth all kleinian groups have infinite volume quotients .      let @xmath62 denote the subset of @xmath47 consisting of those representations @xmath22 with geometrically finite , minimally parabolic image @xmath21 . in particular , if @xmath23 contains no @xmath64 subgroups , then the image @xmath21 of every representation @xmath65 is convex cocompact . set @xmath66 , and note that since @xmath38 is connected , the quotient map gives a one - to - one correspondence between the connected components of @xmath62 and those of @xmath67 .",
    "it is an immediate consequence of the core theorem of scott @xcite and the hyperbolization theorem of thurston that if @xmath68 is non - empty , then @xmath62 is non - empty . for a discussion of the hyperbolization theorem ,",
    "see morgan @xcite , otal and paulin @xcite , or otal @xcite for the fibered case .",
    "we note here that , if there exists a geometrically finite , minimally parabolic representation of @xmath23 into @xmath27 , then in general there exist many geometrically finite representations which are not minimally parabolic , which can be constructed as limits of the geometrically finite , minimally parabolic representations . this construction has been explored in detail for a number of cases by maskit @xcite and ohshika @xcite .    in the case that @xmath23 is itself a geometrically finite , minimally parabolic kleinian group , the structure of @xmath67 is fairly well understood , both as a subset of @xmath50 and in terms of how the components of @xmath67 are parametrized by topological data .",
    "we spend the remainder of this section making these statements precise .",
    "we begin with the quasiconformal stability theorem of marden @xcite .",
    "if @xmath23 is a geometrically finite , minimally parabolic kleinian group , then @xmath67 is an open subset of @xmath35 .",
    "[ quasiconformal - stability ]    as a converse to this , we have the structural stability theorem of sullivan @xcite .",
    "we note here that the versions of the theorems of marden and sullivan given here are not the strongest , but are adapted to the point of view taken in this paper .",
    "the general statements holds valid in slices of @xmath50 in which a certain collection of elements of @xmath23 are required to have parabolic image , not just those which belong to @xmath45 subgroups .",
    "let @xmath23 be a finitely generated , torsion - free , non - elementary kleinian group .",
    "if there exists an open neighborhood of the identity representation in @xmath35 which lies in @xmath50 , then @xmath23 is geometrically finite and minimally parabolic .",
    "[ structural - stability ]    combining these , we see that @xmath67 is the interior of @xmath69 .",
    "a natural question which arises from this is whether there are points of @xmath50 which do not lie in the closure of @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath50 is the closure of @xmath67 .",
    "[ density - conjecture ]    this conjecture is due originally to bers in the case that @xmath23 is the fundamental group of a surface , see bers @xcite , and extended by thurston to general @xmath23 .    there has been a good deal of work in the past couple of years on the global structure of @xmath67 and its closure .",
    "we begin with an example to show that there exist groups @xmath23 for which @xmath67 is disconnected ; the example we give here , in which @xmath67 has finitely many components , comes from the discussion in anderson and canary @xcite .",
