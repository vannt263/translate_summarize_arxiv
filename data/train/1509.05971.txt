    "is rapidly growing.@xcite there are many materials such as simple transition metal oxides ( cro@xmath5 , fe@xmath6o@xmath7 ) , perovskite manganites , transition metal chalcogenides , diluted magnetic semiconductors and many heusler alloys(ha ) , which are promising for spintronics applications.@xcite the striking feature of these materials is their half metallic ( hm ) property . from the band concept ,",
    "half metallicity arises due to the existence of finite density of states for one spin subband ( majority channel ) and a finite band gap for the other ( minority channel ) at the fermi level ( e@xmath8 ) .",
    "the imbalance in the two densities of states results in 100@xmath9 spin polarization of conduction ( majority ) electrons at e@xmath8 . a ferromagnetic material having hm property",
    "is called hm - ferromagnet .",
    "having such type of band structure in the material makes it promising for spin injection and spin manipulation in spintronic devices . among the systems",
    "mentioned , ha emerge out to be the most favored as hm- ferromagnets because of their high curie temperature ( t@xmath10 ) and structural compatibility@xcite compared to those of conventional semiconductors . conventional or full ha crystallize in the ordered l2@xmath4 structure with composition x@xmath11yz in which x and y are the transition metals whereas z is a nonmagnetic element .",
    "a new structure arises when one of x is replaced by a different transition metal , i.e. , the stoichiometry becomes 1:1:1:1 and such alloys are known as quaternary heusler alloys @xcite ( qha ) with the formula xx@xmath12yz .",
    "the resulting compound crystallizes in limgpdsn prototype structure ( or y - structure ) .",
    "if y and z atoms randomly occupy either of the sites , the resulting structure is xx@xmath12y@xmath11/xx@xmath12z@xmath11 .",
    "such a structure is refereed to as l2@xmath13 disordered structure . along with the theoretical prediction of halfmetallicity in ha,@xcite",
    "a lot of experimental work on co - based quaternary ha has been reported.@xcite in this regard , structural analysis , electronic and magnetic properties along with the prediction of high spin polarization in qha have also been studied experimentally.@xcite element - specific magnetic moments and spin resolved density of states in qha are measured using x - ray absorption spectroscopy.@xcite spin polarization measurements in cofecral using point contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) technique reveals 63@xmath9 of spin polarized electrons at e@xmath8.@xcite it has frequently been observed that among all the heusler alloys , co - based ha are the perfect materials for spintronic applications because of the high value of t@xmath10 and spin polarization .    in this paper ,",
    "we report a detailed theoretical and experimental study of two alloys ; cofecrge ( cfcg ) and comncral ( cmca ) .",
    "cfcg is found to have the limgpdsn prototype ( y - structure ) with space group f@xmath143 m whereas cmca has l2@xmath13 disordered structure .",
    "magnetization measurement shows the saturation magnetization of 3@xmath15 and 0.9@xmath15 for cfcg and cmca respectively , which obeys slater - pauling rule.@xcite first principle calculation also yields the same results .",
    "in addition , we have also studied the possible effect of antisite disorder ( l2@xmath13 disorder ) between ( mn@xmath16al@xmath17 ) and ( cr@xmath16al@xmath17 ) pairs in cmca alloy .",
    "interestingly , a unique transition from half metallic to metallic state occurs if we go beyond 3.70@xmath9 al - excess in both mn - al and cr - al pairs .",
    "both the polycrystalline alloys i.e. cfcg and cmca were synthesized by arc melting the stoichiometric amounts of constituent elements with purity of at least 99.99% in water cooled copper hearth under high purity argon atmosphere . to compensate the weight loss in cmca due to mn evaporation , 2% extra mn was taken .",
    "the formed ingots were melted several times for better mixing .",
    "as - cast samples were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes and annealed for 7 days at 800@xmath18c followed by ice / water mixture quenching . to check phase purity of samples ,",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were taken at room temperature , using xpert pro diffractometer with cu k-@xmath19 radiation .",
    "xrd analysis is done with the help of fullprof suite that uses the least square refinement between experimental and calculated intensities .",
    "it contains a number of programs such as dicvol06 for indexing xrd pattern , gfourier for calculating and visualizing electron density within the unit cell etc . for different purposes in xrd and neutron diffraction ( nd ) data analysis .",
    "profile matching well known as lebail fitting is done by refining lattice constant , peak profile shape parameters of pseudo - voigt function as described in fullprof manual.@xcite gfourier program is used for the calculation and visualization of electron density within the unit cell .",
    "the visualization is very useful in identifying the atomic positions of constituent elements within the unit cell for known or unknown crystals i.e. denser the electron density contours indicate the position of heavier element among the constituent elements in the unit cell .",
    "the function to be minimized in the rietveld method is :    @xmath20    with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the variance of the @xmath23observation \" @xmath24 . here",

    "the patterns for cmca were the same before and after annealing , but for cfcg alloy , a small amount of secondary phase was seen after annealing .",
    "therefore , as - prepared cfcg and annealed cmca were used for magnetization m(h , t ) measurements .",
    "m(h , t ) was measured using a physical property measurement system ( ppms ) ( quantum design ) .",
    "high temperature magnetization measurements were performed with an oven attached to the ppms .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , full heusler alloy ( fha ) structure comprises of four inter - penetrating face centered cubic ( fcc ) sublattices and can be thought of as the superposition of rock salt(nacl ) and zinc blend(zns ) type structures.@xcite in nacl structure , each na(cl ) atom is surrounded by six cl(na ) atoms whereas in zns structure , each zn is surrounded by four s atoms and vice - versa .",
    "the atomic sites of nacl structure is called octahedral sites whereas the sites in zns are known as tetrahedral sites .",
    "the ionic nature of bonds in nacl arises due to the large difference in the electronegativity values between the constituent elements .",
    "the covalent bonding nature arises when the difference in electronegativity values of the constituent elements is very small e.g. in zns structure . in ha",
    "if one considers most electronegative element ( usually from p - block ) at ( 0,0,0)fcc site , ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc site will be occupied by the least electronegative element ( usually low valance transition metals).@xcite the remaining two fcc sublattices i.e. ( 1/4,1/4,1/4)fcc and ( 3/4,3/4,3/4)fcc sites will be occupied by the intermediate electronegative elements among the constituent elements . the same nomenclature for atomic sites is used here also , even though they are not surrounded by number of atoms that gave the name . for example , octahedral sites ( 0,0,0)fcc and ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc are surrounded by eight atoms instead of the six atoms suggested by its name . for a fha of the type x@xmath5yz , x atoms are of the intermediate electronegativity values and occupy 8c(1/4,1/4,1/4 ) , ( two fcc sublattices with atoms at ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) and ( 3/4,3/4,3/4 ) ) , y occupies 4a(0,0,0 ) ( one fcc sublattice at ( 0,0,0 ) ) and z atom occupies 4b ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) ( one fcc sublattice at ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) ) wyckoff positions of the space group fm-3m.@xcite the unit cell can be shifted translationally or rotationally by any amount in the crystal and its structure remains the same . if the unit cell of the above atomic positions is shifted by ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) , new atomic positions will be x at 8c , y at 4b and z at 4a wyckoff sites",
    ". there can be other similar combinations .",
    "for the case of qha , if z atom is considered at 4a ( 0,0,0 ) position , the remaining three atoms x , x@xmath12 and y will be placed in three different fcc sublattices 4b(1/2,1/2,1/2 ) , 4c(1/4,1/4,1/4 ) and 4d(3/4,3/4,3/4 ) in three non - degenerate ways such that there are only three independent atomic arrangements in the y structure .",
    "as discussed , any translation of the unit cell does not change the crystal structure , and shifting of these configurations by ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) , ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) or ( 3/4,3/4,3/4 ) of unit cell will simply change the origin of the atoms but not the configuration .",
    "three configurations are shown for cfcg in fig.1 .",
    "for example , if the atomic positions of cr and co are interchanged in fig.1(a ) , the resulting structure is same as the initial one because if that primitive cell is inverted along the body diagonal , the atomic arrangements will be same as the initial one . these are energetically non - degenerate configurations .",
    "similarly the other two configurations in fig.1 can be understood . in this way",
    "there are only three non - degenerate ( distinct ) atomic arrangements for xx@xmath12yz type quaternary heusler alloy .",

    "constituent elements , ge and cr are at 4a(0,0,0 ) and 4b(1/2,1/2,1/2 ) octahedral sites whereas co and fe are at 4c(1/4,1/4,1/4 ) and 4d(3/4,3/4,3/4 ) tetrahedral sites respectively.@xcite for cfcg , cr is the least electronegative ( 1.66 pauli units ) @xcite and therefore , it forms ionic type sublattice with ge ( which has more electronegativity of 2.01 pauli unit ) and becomes stable by donating its electrons to other elements in the alloy .",
    "ge tries to accept electrons from other elements . as a result",
    ", the electronic density at cr site decreases whereas it increases at ge site .",
    "the x and x@xmath12 atoms(here fe and co ) have intermediate electronegativities and occupy tetrahedral sites.@xcite the electronic densities of various atoms in the unit cell can be visualized from the contour plot shown in fig.[fig : fouriermaps1 ] generated from xrd refinement .",
    "it is clear from fig.[fig : fouriermaps1](a ) and ( c ) that most of the charge is distributed around ge atomic site , while cr site has the least density . fe and co are surrounded by intermediate charge in comparison to cr and ge sites in fig.[fig : fouriermaps1](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "this configuration is energetically most favorable as found from our calculation .",

    "( bottom ) magnetic moment vs ` h ' at 300k and 5k for cfcg(left ) and cmca(right ) . ]    for cmca , the superlattice peak ( 200 ) is more intense in comparison to ( 111 ) peak and is clearly visible in the xrd pattern ( fig [ fig : refimentcfcg ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there is considerable amount of disorder between octahedral sites .",
    "this is like b2 disorder in x@xmath5yz ha , but in qha it should not be treated as b2 disorder because x and x@xmath12 are different atoms .",
    "it is rather an l2@xmath4 type disorder where ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) fcc sublattices are randomly occupied by the z and y atoms . from eq.(1 ) , it is clear that @xmath44 reduces as compared to @xmath45 because @xmath46 due to equal probability of finding the z and y atoms at those sites .",
    "hence the intensity , which is proportional to @xmath47 when @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 as x and x@xmath12 are nearest neighbors .",
    "similar to cfcg ( fig.[fig : difcrcfcg ] ) , cmca also has three different configurations with the exception that there is a probability of exchange of atoms between the octahedral sites .",
    "i.e. , ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc sublattices . even though xrd can be fitted with all the three configurations , the configuration in which octahedral site ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc contains the least electronegative element is energetically favorable . here mn and cr have least electronegativity and hence the two configurations ( fig1(a ) and ( b ) ) containing cr or mn at ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc sublattice are favorable .",
    "electronegativity of al is also of the same order as that of mn or cr and consequently al also tries to occupy at ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc . as such",
    ", al occupies different octahedral sites ( 0,0,0)fcc and ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc .",

    ". the conventional unit cell is shifted by ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) while doing the refinement and so the space group changes to fm@xmath50 m ( # 225 ) . in this space group ,",
    "the occupancies are co at 4a , cr at 4b and mn / al at 8c wyckoff sites . as mn and cr",

    "@xmath27 value is same for the first and second configurations , as seen in table [ tab : chi2 ] .",
    "therefore , the conclusion is that cfcg is fully ordered while cmca has l2@xmath13 disordered structure .",
    "it is observed in ha that if more than one atom has nearly same electronegative values , some degree of disorder can be expected . for example ,",
    "comncral , cofecral@xcite and co@xmath11cr@xmath16fe@xmath51al@xcite ha have disorder between cr and al sites .",
    "disorder in these systems arises because of the same electronegativity values of cr and al atoms .",
    "consequently al atom acts as an electron donor and occupies one of the octahedral sites ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc with almost same probability of occupancy as that of cr atoms .",
    "similarly mn@xmath11coal @xcite and co@xmath11mnal @xcite have a disorder between mn and al sites .",
    "this type of disorder is seen in ha containing zn as well .",
    "zn also tries to occupy both octahedral sites ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc and ( 0,0,0)fcc sublattice , because al and zn atoms have the nature that in some cases they lose electrons and in some other cases they accept electrons because of their low electronegativity and proximity to the p - block of the periodic table .",
    "however one can also synthesize perfectly ordered systems in ha containing al atoms , such as cofetial@xcite ( y structure ) , co@xmath5tial@xcite(l2@xmath4 structure ) .",
    "the scenario is a bit different in this case .",
    "since ti atom has the least electronegativity among the constituent atoms , behaves as a charge donor and tries to occupy the ( 1/2,1/2,1/2)fcc and does not allow al to occupy the same site .",
    "hence there will be no disorder in these systems .",
    "therefore , on the basis of data available on a number of alloys , we could propose an empirical relation between relative electronegativity values and the occurrence of disorder .",

    "the absence of hysteresis reveals the soft magnetic nature of the alloys .",
    "both the alloys show saturation at 5k and 300k .",
    "the saturation moment at 5 k is estimated to be 3 @xmath54 and 0.9 @xmath54 for cfcg and cmca respectively .",
    "the total moment in heusler compounds can be estimated from the slater - pauling rule by counting the number of valence electrons in the primitive cell.@xcite in qha , the total moment ( m ) per unit cell can be expressed as @xcite @xmath55where @xmath56 ( s , d electrons for transition metals and s , p electrons for main group element ) is the number of valence electrons per unit cell .",
    "as cfcg and cmca have 27 and 25 valence electrons respectively , according to slater - pauling rule ( using eq.[equ : mub ] ) , the moment in these compounds should be 3 and 1 @xmath54 .",
    "but experimentally observed magnetic moment for cmca ( 0.9@xmath57 ) slightly deviates from the slater - pauling rule , because of the presence of disorder . on the other hand , in cfcg , the agreement is very good .",
    "in addition to the experiment , the theoretically calculated moments also agree fairly well with the slater - pauling prediction ( described in the next section ) .      to check the stability , we have first calculated the site preference energies for various atomic configurations .",
    "considering the symmetry of the xx@xmath12yz structure , we fix the z - atom at 4d position and permute rest three atoms on 4a , 4b and 4c wyckoff sites .",
    "out of six possible configurations , only three are energetically non - degenerate , namely type1 , type2 and type3 as shown in the fig.[fig : difcrcfcg ] for both cfcg and cmca .",

    "is fairly common in qha .",
    "our xrd data clearly indicate the signature of l2@xmath13 disorder in cmca , where al site is expected to mix with mn ( and possibly with cr )",
    ". electronic structure of any material is extremely sensitive to such defects , and has not received much attention in the literature .",
    "we have performed first principle calculation to check the stability , electronic structure and magnetism for two sets of antisite disorders namely comn@xmath16cral@xmath17 and comncr@xmath16al@xmath17 .",

    "such transition is something unique and has never been observed before .",
    "it turns out that this metallic transition is intimately connected with a magnetic transition , where the system goes from a ferromagnetic state to an antiferromagnetic state .",

    "although we have theoretically studied the effect of antisite disorder up to @xmath6614.81@xmath9 , such a large disorder may not be expected to survive in the actual sample .",
    "in conclusion , cfcg and cmca are found to be two interesting materials , the former crystallizes in y type structure while the latter shows an l2@xmath13 disordered structure , which is due to the random occupancy of octahedral site atoms al with cr / mn . both the alloys show half metallic ferromagnetic behavior with a specific site preference for the constituent atoms .",
    "cfcg is more useful because of its high curie temperature ( 866 k ) while cmca shows an intrinsic antisite disorder which allows a larger tunability of its properties .",
    "magnetization measurement yields magnetic moments which obey the slater pauling rule , and which also agree with our theoretical prediction in both the cases .",

    "<S> we present a combined theoretical and experimental study of two quaternary heusler alloys cofecrge ( cfcg ) and comncral ( cmca ) , promising candidates for spintronics applications . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization measurement shows the saturation magnetization and transition temperature to be @xmath0 , @xmath1 k and @xmath2 , @xmath3 k for cfcg and cmca respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization values agree fairly well with our theoretical results and also obey the slater - pauling rule , a prerequisite for half metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> a striking difference between the two systems is their structure ; cfcg crystallizes in fully ordered y - type structure while cmca has l2@xmath4 disordered structure . </S>",
    "<S> the antisite disorder adds a somewhat unique property to the second compound , which arises due to the probabilistic mutual exchange of al positions with cr / mn and such an effect is possibly expected due to comparable electronegativities of al and cr / mn . _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ simulation predicted a unique transition from half metallic ferromagnet to metallic antiferromagnet beyond a critical excess concentration of al in the alloy . </S>"
