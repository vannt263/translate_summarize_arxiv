    "in many fields of physical sciences , one is confronted with the description of the evolution of a system of particles which self - consistently attract each other over large distances @xcite .",
    "this is the case in biology , for example , in relation with the process of chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis explains the spontaneous self - organization of biological cells ( bacteria , amoebae , endothelial cells , ... ) or even insects ( like ants ) due to the long - range attraction of a chemical ( pheromone , smell , food , ... ) produced by the organisms themselves .",
    "the chemotactic aggregation of biological populations is usually studied in terms of the keller - segel model consisting in two coupled differential equations @xcite : @xmath1 @xmath2 which describe the evolution of the concentration @xmath3 of the biological organisms and of the secreted chemical @xmath4 . the keller - segel model is a _",
    "parabolic model _ where the evolution of the concentration of the biological organisms is governed by a drift - diffusion equation ( [ intro1 ] ) .",
    "the diffusion models the erratic motion of the particles ( like in brownian theory ) and the drift term models a systematic motion along the gradient of concentration of the secreted chemical . when @xmath5 the cells are attracted in regions of high concentration while for @xmath6 they are repelled from the regions of high concentration ( in that case the chemical acts as a poison ) .",
    "the evolution of the secreted chemical is described by a diffusion equation ( [ intro2 ] ) involving terms of source and degradation : the chemical is produced by the organisms at a rate @xmath7 and it is degraded at a rate @xmath8 . for @xmath5 , the keller - segel model is able to reproduce the chemotactic aggregation ( collapse ) of biological populations when the attractive drift term @xmath9 overcomes the diffusive term @xmath10 above a critical mass @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the gravitational collapse of self - gravitating brownian particles , described by the smoluchowski - poisson system , below a critical temperature @xmath12 @xcite ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the analogy between the keller - segel model and the smoluchowski - poisson system ) .",
    "these parabolic models ultimately lead to the formation of dirac peaks @xcite .",
    "some regularizations of the keller - segel model have been introduced .",
    "they have the form of generalized drift - diffusion equations @xcite : @xmath13 @xmath14 in which the simple diffusion term @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ intro1 ] ) is replaced by a more general `` pressure term '' @xmath16 . the drift - diffusion equation ( [ add1 ] )",
    "is similar to a generalized smoluchowski equation @xcite . and the chemotactic sensitivity @xmath17 depend on the density of cells @xmath18 and on the density of chemical @xmath19 is considered in the primitive model of keller & segel @xcite ( see appendix [ sec_prim ] ) .",
    "the very much studied model ( [ intro1])-([intro2 ] ) is a simplification of the primitive keller - segel model where the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath17 are assumed constant . ] by adapting the barotropic equation of state @xmath21 , one can obtain regularized chemotactic models preventing the density from reaching infinitely large values and forming singularities @xcite . in that case , the dirac peaks ( clumps ) are replaced by smoother density profiles ( aggregates ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the regularized model ( [ add1])-([add2 ] ) generically leads to the formation of @xmath22 round aggregates which progressively merge until only one big aggregate remains at the end .",
    "however , recent experiments of _ in vitro _ formation of blood vessels show that cells randomly spread on a gel matrix autonomously organize to form a connected vascular network that is interpreted as the beginning of a vasculature @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible of angiogenesis , a major actor for the growth of tumors .",
    "these networks can not be explained by the parabolic models ( [ intro1])-([add2 ] ) that lead to pointwise blow - up or round aggregates .",
    "however , they can be recovered by _ hyperbolic models _ that lead to the formation of networks patterns that are in good agreement with experimental results .",
    "these models take into account inertial effects and they have the form of hydrodynamic equations @xcite : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 the inertial term models cells directional persistence and the general density dependent pressure term @xmath26 can take into account the fact that the cells do not interpenetrate . in these models ,",
    "the particles concentrate on lines or filaments .",
    "these structures share some analogies with the formation of ants networks ( due to the attraction of a pheromonal substance ) and with the large - scale structures in the universe that are described by similar hydrodynamic ( hyperbolic ) equations : the so - called euler - poisson system .",
    "the similarities between the networks observed in astrophysics ( see figs 10 - 11 of @xcite ) and biology ( see figs 1 - 2 of @xcite ) are striking .    the above - mentioned parabolic and hyperbolic models are continuous models which describe the evolution of a smooth density field @xmath3 and , in the case of hyperbolic models , a smooth velocity field @xmath27 . in this paper , we propose a kinetic derivation of these models starting from a microscopic description of the dynamics of the biological population .",
    "we introduce stochastic equations for the motion of each individual and , implementing a mean field approximation , we obtain the corresponding fokker - planck equation governing the evolution of the distribution function @xmath28 of the system in phase space .",
    "the stochastic langevin equations involve a friction force , an effective force due to the chemotactic attraction of the chemical and a random force ( noise ) whose strength can depend on the local distribution function itself .",
    "this dependence can take into account microscopic constraints ( `` hidden constraints '' ) that affect the dynamics of the particles at small scales .",
    "we can have ( i ) _ close packing effects _ ( like finite size effects , excluded volume constraints , steric hindrance ... ) that forbid the interpenetration of the particles and prevent the system from reaching arbitrarily high densities @xcite and ( ii ) _ nonextensivity effects _ that alter the usual random walk and lead to anomalous diffusion and non - ergodic behaviour @xcite .",
    "the resulting generalized stochastic equations lead to nonlinear mean field fokker - planck equations similar to those occurring in the context of generalized thermodynamics @xcite . therefore ,",
    "as first noticed in @xcite , the chemotaxis of biological populations can be a physical system where a notion of effective generalized thermodynamics applies . by taking the successive moments of these generalized fokker - planck equations and using a local thermodynamic equilibrium condition , we derive a closed set of hydrodynamic equations @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 involving a friction term @xmath32 @xcite .",

    "we discuss the analogy between bacterial colonies and self - gravitating systems and between the chemotactic collapse and the `` gravitational collapse '' ( jeans instability ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the kinetic and hydrodynamic models of biological populations derived in this paper are similar to those describing self - gravitating systems @xcite . therefore",
    ", our approach connects various topics studied by different communities : systems with long - range interactions @xcite , nonlinear mean field fokker - planck equations and generalized thermodynamics @xcite , self - gravitating systems @xcite and chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "we shall introduce a model of chemotactic aggregation generalizing the keller - segel model ( [ intro1])-([intro2 ] ) . for biological systems ,",
    "the number of constituents is not necessarily large so that it may be relevant to return to a `` corpuscular '' description of the system and introduce an equation of motion for each particle ( @xmath35 cell ) .",
    "this type of `` microscopic '' approach has been previously considered by schweitzer & schimansky - geier @xcite , stevens @xcite and newman & grima @xcite ( see also related work by the authors ) coupled by a _ binary _ potential of interaction @xmath36 instead of the more complicated potential @xmath19 , solution of eq .",
    "( [ fluct2 ] ) , depending on the past history of the system ( memory terms are , however , considered in @xcite ) .",

    "they describe the motion of individuals by a stochastic equation of the form @xmath41 the first term in the r.h.s . is the chemotactic drift to which the particles are submitted ( the coefficient @xmath17 plays the role of a mobility ) .",
    "the second term is a stochastic term where @xmath42 is a white noise satisfying @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 refer to the particles and @xmath46 to the space coordinates ) and @xmath20 is a diffusion coefficient .",
    "the diffusion , that is observed for several biological organisms , can have different origins depending on the system under consideration @xcite .",
    "in the case of small organisms moving in a fluid ( matrigel ) , it can be due to the repeated impact of the molecules of the fluid on the particles like in ordinary brownian motion for colloidal suspensions .",
    "in other cases , it can be due to the properties of motion of the particles themselves .",
    "for example , bacteria like _ escherichia coli _ are equipped with flagella and are self - propelled . when rotated counterclockwise , the flagella act as a propellor and the bacterium moves along straight line ( `` run '' ) . suddenly , the flagella rotate clockwise and the bacterium stops to choose a new direction at random ( `` tumble '' )",
    ". it continues in that direction for a while until the next tumble .",
    "therefore , the bacteria experience a random motion of their own . at the simplest level of description",
    ", this motion can be modelled by a stochastic term like in eq .",
    "( [ fluct18 ] ) .",
    "these stochastic equations describe the motion of each of the @xmath0 particles of the colony . as indicated above , @xmath0 is not necessarily large so it may be of interest to treat the bacterial colony as a discrete system of particles .",
    "by contrast , the chemical that is secreted is usually described as a continuous field .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the concentration of the chemical is governed by an equation of the form @xmath47 equations ( [ fluct18])-([fluct2 ] ) have been studied in @xcite . in the mean - field approximation , they return the usual keller - segel model ( [ intro1])-([intro2 ] ) .",
    "we shall generalize the model ( [ fluct18])-([fluct2 ] ) in two respects .",
    "first of all , there exists biological systems for which the inertia of the particles has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "this `` inertia '' means that they do not respond immediately to the chemotactic drift .",
    "we propose therefore to describe the motion of each individual of the biological population by a stochastic equation of the form @xmath48 the first term in the r.h.s . is an `` effective '' friction force , the second term is a force that models the chemotactic attraction due to the chemical @xmath19 and the last term is a random force .",
    "the friction force takes into account the fact that the velocity of the particles has the tendency to be directed along the concentration gradient @xmath49 .",
    "this is exactly the case when @xmath50 .",
    "in this strong friction limit , we recover the overdamped model ( [ fluct18 ] ) with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for finite values of @xmath53 , the velocity will take a ( relaxation ) time @xmath54 to get aligned with the concentration gradient .",
    "this is how an inertial effect is introduced in the model .",
    "the term @xmath55 can also represent a physical friction of the organisms against a fixed matrigel .",
    "the stochastic equations ( [ fluct1 ] ) , coupled self - consistently to the field equation ( [ fluct2 ] ) , describe the motion of each of the @xmath0 particles of the colony .",
    "this completely discrete model of chemotactic aggregation , which takes into account statistical correlations between the particles , is developed in appendix [ sec_manybody ] .",
    "an exact equation for the single - cell probability distribution is derived and it is shown precisely how a mean field approximation can be implemented in the theory . in the mean - field approximation , passing to a hydrodynamical description , we obtain the model ( [ intro3ht])-([intro5ht ] ) with a linear ( isothermal ) equation of state @xmath56 .    in order to describe more general situations where the equation of state @xmath57 is nonlinear , we shall consider a generalized class of stochastic equations where the diffusion coefficient explicitly depends on the distribution function @xmath28 of particles in phase space .",
    "these generalized stochastic equations have been introduced in @xcite .",
    "they are associated with nonlinear fokker - planck equations and lead to a notion of `` generalized thermodynamics '' . the possibility to apply this type of equations to the chemotactic problem",
    "was proposed in @xcite . in order to simplify the formalism",
    ", we shall make a mean - field approximation since the start and describe the motion of each individual of the biological population by a stochastic equation of the form @xmath58 where the mean field force is determined by the equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the _ smooth _ local density of cells ( the brackets denote an average over the noise ) .",
    "this amounts to replacing the exact density @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ fluct2 ] ) by the smooth density @xmath62 .",
    "this is how the mean - field approximation is introduced in the model . for sake of generality",
    ", we have allowed the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 to depend on the concentration @xmath19 and we have written the chemotactic force as the gradient of a function @xmath65 of the concentration .",
    "equations ( [ lang1])-([lang2 ] ) will be our starting point for the chemotactic problem .",
    "this model , or the discrete model ( [ fluct1 ] ) , is similar to the model of self - gravitating brownian particles introduced in @xcite .",
    "the main difference , beyond the context , is that the poisson equation in gravity is replaced by the more general field equation ( [ lang2 ] ) .",
    "we shall now derive kinetic and hydrodynamic equations associated with the stochastic model ( [ lang1])-([lang2 ] ) .",
    "using standard methods of brownian theory , we find that the evolution of the distribution function @xmath28 of the system is described by a generalized mean field fokker - planck equation of the form @xmath66 we have considered a relatively general class of stochastic processes ( [ lang1 ] ) where the diffusion coefficient @xmath67 can depend on the distribution function .",
