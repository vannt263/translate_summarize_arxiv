    "a new trend in controlling cooperative states of interacting electronic systems is applying either very short ( tens of femtoseconds ) powerful optical pulses or very high ( up to @xmath0 v / cm ) electric fields ( `` the electrostatic doping '' ) , see refs . [ ] . these impacts result in a very high ( up to 10% per lattice site ) concentration of excitations or charge carriers .",
    "there are convincing arguments that these states will not resemble ensembles of electrons and/or holes like for optical pumping or field - effect injection in conventional semiconductors and can include superconductivity , antiferromagnetism , ferroelectricity , charge order , charge- and spin - density waves , mott and peierls insulators .",
    "the reason is that the commonly exploited strongly correlated electronic systems show various types of symmetry breaking giving rise to degenerate ground states .",
    "the degeneracy allows for topologically nontrivial configurations exploring the possibility of traveling through different allowed ground states .",
    "their most known forms are plain domain walls , stripes , vortex lines , or dislocations , which are still macroscopic objects extending in one or two dimensions .",
    "most importantly , there are also totally localized and truly microscopic objects whose energies and quantum numbers are on the one - electron scale .",
    "these anomalous particles  the solitons  can determine the observable properties , which are usually ascribed to conventional electronic excitations , see refs .",
    "[ ] for early theory reviews and refs .",
    "[ ] for updates .",
    "the fact that the solitons have quantum eigenvalues ( charge or spin ) makes it possible to control and monitor their concentration . the electrostatic doping",
    "( see the review @xcite and updates in @xcite ) should give rise to a stable @xmath1 ensemble of similarly charged kinks in a thin , sometimes atomically narrow , surface layer .",
    "the optical pumping should give rise firstly to an equal number of oppositely charged solitons , whose collisions will work to convert them secondly to an ensemble of neutral spin - carrying solitons ( which usually have lower energy than the charged ones @xcite ) . inevitably , recombination will follow , possibly via the formation of excitons as pairs of oppositely charged kinks @xcite .",
    "however , the optical emission will take long ( more than nanoseconds ) time , which can be further prolonged by the intermediate conversion to neutral spin - carrying solitons , which can recombine only via triplet channels  the effect is well documented in the optics of conducting polymers @xcite . then , for a typically very fast pump - induced phase transition experiment , even the system of oppositely charged solitons , and even more of spin - carrying ones , can be treated as quasi stationary , with only slowly decreasing number of particles .",
    "this number is exactly conserved and monitored in experiments with the electrostatic doping .",
    "such ensembles of solitons are expected to have a peculiar phase diagram , with several lines of phase transitions , which are inevitably crossed in the course of the evolution or monitoring the concentration and the temperature .",
    "the study of these transitions is the main goal of this paper . in the next section of introduction",
    ", we shall summarize modern experimental and theoretical evidences in favor of existence of solitons in electronic systems . in sec.ii",
    ", we shall give a qualitative picture of phase transitions in ensembles of neutral and charged solitons .",
    "the central issue is the confinement interaction specific to solitons in contrast to conventional electrons . in sec.iii",
    ", we shall introduce the basic model , which is mapped onto the constrained ising model , and also present some analytical results . in sec.iv",
    ", we shall present the results of extensive numerical modeling , which was challenging for three - dimensional systems , particularly in presence of coulomb interactions ( ci ) .",
    "we shall observe a high - temperature transition of confinement of solitons into pairs and a particularly rich and interesting low - temperature transition of soliton aggregation into domain walls transversing the sample .",
    "sec.v is devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "appendices contain estimations for the aggregation transition for neutral and charged solitons .",
    "there are growing experimental evidences on existence of microscopic solitons and their determining role in electronic processes of quasi-1d systems : conjugated polymers ( see @xcite on theory and @xcite on experiment ) , spin - peierls chains @xcite , donor - acceptor stacks including `` electronic ferroelectrics '' @xcite , and families of the so - called `` electronic crystals '' , particularly charge density waves ( cdw ) and charge - ordered mott insulators ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "solitons take over band electrons in roles of primary excitations ",
    "charge or spin carriers , since their activation energies are typically lower than gaps opened in the electronic spectra .",
    "the solitons feature self - trapping of electrons into mid - gap states and separation of spin and charge into spinons and holons , sometimes with their reconfinement at essentially different scales .",
    "thus , the ferroelectric charge ordering in organic conductors ( see a review @xcite ) gives access to several types of solitons observed in conductivity ( holons ) and in permittivity ( polar kinks ) , to soliton bound pairs in optics , to compound charge - spin solitons .",
    "in cdws @xcite and in surface nano - wires @xcite the individual solitons , which are the amplitude kinks , have been visually captured in stm experiments ; this is the most remarkable new achievement in proving the existence of solitons .",
    "the resolved subgap tunneling spectra @xcite recover presumably the same solitons in dynamics .",
    "the tunneling creation of soliton pairs describes nonlinear transport in cdws @xcite and polymers @xcite .",
    "the solitons can be also viewed as nucleus of the melted stripe phase in doped mott insulators or of the fflo phase in spin polarized superconductors @xcite .    on this basis",
    "one can extrapolate to a picture of combined topological excitations in general strongly correlated systems : from doped antiferromagnets to strong - coupling and spin - polarized superconductors @xcite .",
    "following the above quoted experimental confirmations and theoretical results , we shall consider a system where the solitons serve as the lowest ( with respect to band electrons ) energy forms of storage of the charge or the spin .",
    "we shall restrict the study to the case of a discrete symmetry breaking , which is a very common phenomenon of a dimerization of bonds ( the family of peierls - like transitions ) or of sites ( the family of transitions with charge ordering or disproportionation ) .",
    "such a system possesses typically three types of solitons : spinless ones with charges @xmath2 and a neutral one with the spin @xmath3 . in ferroelectric systems ( see a recent review @xcite ) all solitons should carry noninteger charges . with passing of such a soliton , the order parameter changes the sign , hence the nickname `` the amplitude kink '' , or just the `` kink '' or the soliton , which we shall use in the following .",
    "cases of continuous symmetries like incommensurate cdws , spin density waves and superconductors , require special consideration .",
    "the solitons are subject to all kinds of interactions , among themselves and also with the lattice , known for conventional electrons .",
    "the important ci can be screened or not screened by external carriers and we shall consider both cases .",
    "but beyond that , there is the unusual super long - range interaction specific to the solitons as topologically nontrivial objects .",
    "the soliton is a @xmath4 domain boundary that interrupts the proper interchain arrangement .",
    "that gives rise to the confinement energy @xmath5 , with the constant confinement force @xmath6 , growing linearly with the distance between solitons @xmath7  see fig.[fig : t > t1 ] .",
    "this energy dominates at long distances even if it can be unimportant locally for a crystal of weakly interacting chains .    in some special cases ,",
    "the ground - state degeneracy can be lifted by an internal effect globally  for the whole system .",
    "a bright example is the cis - polyacetylene @xcite , where the solitons are always confined in pairs . in cases of continuous symmetries ,",
    "the ordering violated by the amplitude kink can be restored by changes in the phase of the complex order parameter @xmath8 , localized in the tails of a soliton of length @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the temperature of the long - range ordering due to the interchain coupling .",
    "but universally , except truly @xmath4 systems like isolated atomic chains @xcite , there is a local lifting of degeneracy that comes from interchain interactions , which are responsible for establishing the long - range @xmath1 or @xmath11 ordering .",
    "namely , the interchain ordering energy @xmath12 ( per longitudinal lattice unit of the length @xmath13 ) is paid when adjacent domains at neighboring chains are not rightly correlated .    the confinement interaction determines the intermediate phases and the kinetics of aggregation of nonequilibrium ( e.g. , optically induced ) domains into the long - range ordered phase .      consider the influence of weak ordering interaction between chains ( @xmath1 or @xmath11 coupling ) on the state and statistical properties of the kinklike solitons @xcite .",
    "the weak interchain coupling does not affect substantially the structure of the soliton core , but below the @xmath1 or @xmath11 ordering temperature @xmath14 , its role turns out to be fundamental at large distances .",
    "since each kink separates different states of the system , the correlation between the chains is violated in its vicinity . as a result ,",
    "the system loses an energy @xmath15 per site , which increases proportionally to the distance from the soliton . as we see from fig.[fig : t > t1 ] , the energy grows both with separation of two solitons on one chain and among solitons at neighboring chains , hence the tendencies to either formation of on - chain bikinks or the interchain aggregation of solitons into walls . as a result of these contradictory tendencies , as temperature lowers",
    ", the system passes through two phase transitions : the coupling of solitons into pairs at @xmath16 , and aggregation of pairs between the chains at lower @xmath17 . for a three - dimensional system ,",
    "the temperature @xmath18 is a phase - transition point , below which plane domain walls appear in the system passing through the entire cross section .",
    "for a two - dimensional system , this is not the distinct phase transition ; instead a gradual increase of the transverse dimension of the paired walls takes place at @xmath19 . for a finite system , like in our modeling",
    ", there is a sample dependent temperature @xmath20 where the first wall crosses the whole sample even in @xmath21 .",
    "this qualitative picture is based upon an exact solution available for a @xmath1 system of neutral solitons with some qualitative extensions to the @xmath11 case @xcite .",
    "the case of charged solitons has been addressed in @xcite , but with a restrictive constraint : the bisoliton pairs were not supposed to move from one chain to another .",
    "here we shall present the results of unrestricted numerical modeling performed for the challenging case of a @xmath11 system , both for neutral and charged ensembles of solitons .    in short ,",
    "the picture of equilibrium states is the following . with lowering @xmath22 at a given concentration of kinks @xmath23",
    ", the system passes through a sequence of two phase transitions ( at @xmath24 ) and a crossover in between ( at @xmath25 ) , which are determined by three scales of energy : @xmath12 as the local energy of the interchain ordering , the bigger @xmath26 as the nonlocal energy of soliton confinement , and the smaller @xmath27 as the characteristic energy of soliton transverse aggregation .",
    "i. @xmath28 ( see fig.[fig : t1>t > t2 ] ) . for the order parameter , this is the conventional @xmath11 ordering transition realized in a quasi-@xmath4 system . however , for the ensemble of solitons , this is a confinement transition , which takes place when the temperature decreases below the mean interchain interaction @xmath5 at the mean distance @xmath29 between the solitons .",
    "below that , at @xmath30 , individual on - chain solitons can not exist , they are confined into loose pairs which form strings of size @xmath31 with energy @xmath32 among them ( @xmath33 can be also defined by the condition @xmath34 , when confined pairs dissociate ) . with lowering @xmath22 , the pairs become progressively more confined at the thermal length @xmath35 , with rare collisions among the pairs . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the pairs become tightly bound , their spacing does not fluctuate anymore .",
    "the confinement energy is reduced from the high-@xmath22 scale @xmath12 per unit cell to @xmath12 per kinks pair .",
    "actually , the pair length @xmath31 shrinks from the thermal one @xmath37 to the quantum zero point limit @xmath38 such that @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is an effective mass of the soliton ) .",
    "thus , the energy @xmath14 has two faces . for the order parameter ,",
    "this is just the transition temperature @xmath41 of the second - order phase transition to the state with its nonzero mean value at @xmath42 .",
    "however , for solitons , this is the confinement transition temperature , below which they become bound into pairs  the bisolitons .",
    "@xmath43 ( see fig.[fig : t < t2 ] ) .",
    "this temperature can be viewed as the onset of aggregation of solitons when first domain walls appear crossing the whole sample or forming macroscopic bubbles . as the temperature lowers beyond @xmath12 ,",
    "the bisolitons start to aggregate in transverse disks , and finally at @xmath44 these disks cross the entire sample .",
    "aggregation to domain walls gains the confinement energy , which now is not lost at all  the neighboring chains are always in the right arrangement .",
    "however , the entropy is lost , and this balance determines @xmath18 . the pairs still coexist with walls below @xmath18 , but with further decreasing @xmath22 they vanish providing the material for building more macroscopic walls .    the @xmath18 transition can be viewed similarly to a vapor condensation in a given volume when the first appearing wetting fixes the chemical potential ( the saturation pressure ) of the gas . another analogy is the bose - einstein condensation , but in real , instead of the reciprocal , space .",
    "indeed , below @xmath12 , there is the gas of `` confined pairs '' ( bisolitons ) with energy @xmath45 , whose chemical potential @xmath46 is adjusted to maintain the given total concentration @xmath47 .",
    "when the first macroscopic domain walls appear , they serve as a reservoir of kinks fixing their chemical potential  ideally at @xmath48 , hence @xmath49 .",
    "then the concentration of pairs is @xmath50 , and this number falls below the total available @xmath51 , which happens at @xmath19 .",
    "the deficit @xmath52 gives the number of solitons that have been used to build the domain walls , with @xmath53 giving the mean period of the stripe array of domain walls .",
    "notice a curious behavior : with lowering @xmath22 below @xmath18 , the mean value of the order parameter over the bulk disappears , while it is present over each cross - section .",
    "the @xmath18 transition is the one where the effective dimensionality of the system @xmath54 is reduced by @xmath55 !",
    "we shall see this explicitly via the effective ising model with constraints .",
    "after the optical pulse has created the ensemble of solitons , their mean concentration @xmath23 starts to evolve as @xmath56 both to thermal equilibrium at a given @xmath22 and also together with the temperature @xmath57 . on this way",
    ", the system will pass through a sequence of phase transitions or at least of crossovers among different regimes which have been classified above .",
    "the trajectory is summarized in fig.[fig : phase - diag ] .     and",
    "@xmath18 , the vertical dashed line shows a crossover at @xmath58 , the dashed arrowed lines give schematically the trajectory of the pumping and subsequent relaxation ( decrease of the total @xmath23 and the cooling ) . ]    before the pumping , at the equilibrium ambient temperature @xmath59 , the solitons are present either as free particles , if @xmath60 , or as confined pairs if @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the ordering transition temperature without pumping ( here @xmath63 is the soliton s core energy ) .",
    "however , in any case , the equilibrium concentration of kinks is low : @xmath64 at @xmath60 or @xmath65 at @xmath66 , because now the total big activation energy @xmath67 of the soliton is to be paid in comparison with the relatively small scale of the interchain energy @xmath12 when the number of solitons is controlled .    just after the pumping , the initial concentration of kinks @xmath68 is very high and the initial temperature @xmath69 is also high ( it can even further increase at intermediate times because of the energy release from relaxation of excitations @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath70 so that we are in the disordered phase above @xmath71  the pumping has destroyed the long - range order , the solitons are not confined in pairs .",
    "with time , both @xmath56 and @xmath57 decrease , so the two sides of the last inequality move towards each other , the transition is inevitably reached at some time @xmath72 when @xmath73 .",
    "recall that this temperature is well below the thermodynamical transition temperature @xmath74 since the number of solitons is still strongly enhanced .",
    "the situation looks , at first sight , a bit less certain for the lower transition because its expected temperature @xmath75 falls with decreasing @xmath56 , unlike @xmath76 .",
    "however , @xmath77 decreases very slowly , e.g. , @xmath78 for the exponential decay of @xmath23 , which is slower than any expected decrease of @xmath57 .",
    "so the second phase transition will also happen at a certain moment @xmath79 of time , when @xmath80 , then the confined pairs of solitons will start to aggregate into macroscopic domain walls of solitons .",
    "the @xmath44 transition line will be crossed back ( via evaporation of domain walls ) in the course of returning the temperature to the ambient one and the full annihilation of excess solitons .",
    "for a generic ( no cis ) model , the configurational energy for the order parameter @xmath81 at the point @xmath82 of the chain @xmath83 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the interchain ordering energy per unit longitudinal length ( actually , @xmath86 is the confinement force @xmath6 , where @xmath87 is the number of nearest neighboring chains for @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 is a double - well potential with two symmetrical minima normalized to @xmath90 , which determines the two possible equivalent ground states . the soliton is a trajectory , taking the energy cost @xmath67 , which commutes between these two minima ; e.g. @xmath91 or whatever is the antisymmetric solution determined by the competition of second and third terms in ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to quantize the chain length as @xmath92 in some units @xmath93 well exceeding the intrinsic width @xmath94 of the soliton ( we take @xmath93 to be equal to the quantum zero point limit size @xmath95  the minimal size of a bisoliton , see sec .",
    "[ tentative_phase_diagram ] ) and to introduce the ising spin variable as @xmath96 .",
    "then the solitons , with the linear density @xmath97 , are seen as sharp kinks , whose number per site is given by the lattice function @xmath98 such that @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mean concentration of solitons per site , @xmath101 is their total number , @xmath102 are the dimensions of the sample in units of @xmath93 and @xmath103 , respectively . representation ( [ rho ] ) underlines the fact that a soliton is present at the site @xmath104 of the dual lattice only if @xmath105 and @xmath106 or vice versa . in the single chain limit , @xmath107 and @xmath108 play the roles of complementary order and disorder parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mean density can be controlled by the chemical potential @xmath109 and we arrive at the gibbs energy @xmath110 for the grand canonical ensemble of solitons @xcite : @xmath111 in a number of cases , particularly in application to doping , the solitons can possess an electric charge .",
    "if screening by external carriers is strong enough , these solitons behave as neutral ones .",
    "however , in case of intermediate or weak screening , the charges of solitons must be considered explicitly .",
    "therefore , taking into account the ci , we can add also @xcite the coulomb energy @xmath112 to the hamiltonian : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the electron charge and @xmath115 is the dielectric constant , taken here to be isotropic .",
    "it is known that competing short - range attractive and long - range repulsive forces may result in the formation of a diverse variety of patterns @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ numerical_approach ] , we shall describe monte carlo modeling for both neutral and charged cases .",
    "it is remarkable that controlling the chemical potential , the grand canonical ensemble of solitons in a @xmath54-dimensional system can be described by the @xmath54-dimensional ising model , while the canonical ensemble is described by the stack of noninteracting @xmath116-dimensional models with an overall constraint . in this anisotropic model ,",
    "only the interchain coupling constant @xmath12 has a physical origin and is frozen , while the on - chain constant @xmath117 is determined by the chemical potential . since the physical situations of interest correspond to controlling the concentration @xmath23 , then the price , and the source , of the most interesting behavior come from the self - consistency condition to invert the function @xmath118 to @xmath119 , hence traveling over a special line on the surface of ising model parameters . in this way",
    ", we can take a good advantage ( without ci ) of notion on the ising models ( full for @xmath21 and qualitative at least for @xmath120 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as we shall demonstrate in the following , a numerical procedure can be constructed which allows to directly keep the constraint on the total number of solitons .",
    "then working with the canonical ensemble we get a good advantage to deal with @xmath116-dimensional systems with only physical interchain interaction being present .",
    "consider the effective ising model with adjustable @xmath121 in @xmath54 dimensions .",
    "the concentration of solitons is always supposed to be small @xmath122 .",
    "here we find the adjusted values of @xmath123 in @xmath1 and @xmath11 for limiting cases of high and low temperatures and make estimations for @xmath76 and @xmath124 .    in the high - temperature limit @xmath125 ,",
    "the system is effectively one - dimensional ; the energy of one soliton is @xmath126 and the probability to find a soliton at a given point of the dual lattice is @xmath127 then @xmath128 is the effective on - chain coupling , hence , from ( [ originalh ] ) , the soliton chemical potential increases with decreasing @xmath22 . extrapolating this expression down to @xmath33 , we find an estimate for @xmath33 . for @xmath21 , we deduce from onsager s exact result @xcite @xmath129 that @xmath130 , which up to a numerical factor , agrees with the result of ref .",
    ": @xmath131 ( see also appendix a ) . for @xmath120",
    ", we can use the approximation , where the on - chain interaction is treated exactly while the interchain one is taken into account using the mean - field theory . for the critical temperature of anisotropic @xmath11 ising model",
    ", this approach gives @xcite @xmath132 , from which we get @xmath133 .",
    "we see that both in @xmath1 and @xmath11 the ising critical temperature behaves as @xmath134 at @xmath135 , which justifies treating @xmath14 as the confinement transition .",
    "consider now the opposite limit of low temperatures @xmath136 .",
    "it looks , at first sight and wrongly , that at low temperatures , the system persists in a very simple form of one spin - ordered domain impregnated by a dilute gas of spin - reversed sites , which are our tightly bound bisolitons with the energy @xmath137 . taking into account the chemical potential and neglecting the excluded volume corrections , the concentration of bisolitons is @xmath138 since this number is fixed at @xmath139 , then lowering @xmath22 must be compensated by the decrease of @xmath117 , which is limited to be positive @xmath140 : a negative @xmath141 would switch the system to an `` antiferromagnetic '' ground state with spins alternation at each site in the chain direction , hence the infinite number of kinks .",
    "hence a new reservoir for the storage of solitons must be opened when @xmath22 falls below @xmath77 such that @xmath142 , i.e. , @xmath143which agrees with both the estimation ( [ appa_t2 ] ) for @xmath1 ( with logarithmic accuracy ) and with the exact solution ( [ t2 ] ) accessible in @xmath11 .",
    "this new reservoir can be viewed as a system of stripes ( lines in @xmath1 or planes in @xmath11 ) which cross the whole sample separating the bulk in noninteracting domains of alternating magnetization .",
    "a more thorough analysis @xcite shows that @xmath18 must be indeed a sharp phase transition at @xmath120 , while at @xmath21 it is only a crossover for growing rods of a finite extent . only for a finite @xmath1 system of width @xmath144 the rods pass through the entire cross - section of the sample at @xmath145 .",
    "estimates for @xmath123 can also be found at @xmath36 . for @xmath21 as @xmath146 and @xmath120 as @xmath147",
    "we find that @xmath148 as ( details of derivations are given in the appendix a ) @xmath149 below @xmath44 in @xmath11 , transverse layers do not interact and @xmath117 remains @xmath150 .",
    "this picture , and its strong complication by long - range cis will be numerically verified and expanded in the next section .",
    "some analytical results for both neutral and charged systems are also given in the appendices .",
    "in this section , we consider the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the ensemble of solitons .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of the canonical ensemble of solitons over broad temperature ranges in two and three dimensions for both neutral and charged solitons .    in the numerical simulations , it is more efficient to keep a fixed number of solitons rather than using self - consistent @xmath151 as we did in the previous section . here",
    "then we shall work with the canonical ensemble of solitons keeping fixed their overall number , while the number of solitons at a given chain can vary ( in contrary to the more restrictive prescription employed in @xcite ) .",
    "the mc simulation was performed with the use of the standard metropolis algorithm with three types of unit movements : moving a single soliton along the chain [ fig.[solmovements]a ] , moving a solitons pair along [ fig.[solmovements]b ] , or across the chains [ fig.[solmovements]c ] .",
    "the type-(b ) movement is a superposition of two type-(a ) movements , but it is useful to consider the type-(b ) movement explicitly since it improves the low - temperature acceptance rate of the algorithm .    for the case of charged solitons , we need to take into account the long - range ci , which is always a formidable task , and even more here for the system prone to pattern formation , owing to the appearance of locally noncompensated charges at a growing scale .",
    "since we are interested in the wall formation process , and for an infinite charged wall the electric potential grows linearly with the distance , then correctly imposing periodic boundary conditions for the ci becomes very important .",
    "we use the periodic version of the coulomb hamiltonian ( [ hcoulomb ] ) ( for simplicity , we put @xmath152 in the simulation ) , where the summation goes over not only all pairwise interactions within a computational cell , but also between solitons and their images and between images and the neutralizing negative background . in practice",
    ", this is done by the technique of lekner @xcite for both @xmath1 [ ] and @xmath11 [ ] cases .",
    "this technique allows to efficiently calculate the force acting on a given particle from another particle and all its images and , and by integrating the force , to obtain the effective pairwise potential .",
    "finally , we tabulate this potential for fast computations .    since the ci is the long - range one , the calculation of the energy change @xmath153 at each mc - step can be time consuming . to deal with this we use two different approaches .",
    "when the mc acceptance rate is high , we employ the first ( standard ) approach : at each mc trial step we recalculate the ci energy of the shifted soliton with respect to other solitons .",
    "however , at low temperatures , when the mc acceptance rate becomes low , it turns out that this approach is ineffective , since many calculations are wasted to compute @xmath153 for rejected steps .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures ( and low mc acceptance rates ) we use another algorithm @xcite : instead of recalculating the interaction energy of the shifted soliton with every soliton in the system at each trial mc step ( computational cost of which is @xmath154 ) ) , we introduce an electric potential @xmath155 and use it to calculate the coulomb energy change : @xmath156 , the computational cost of which is only @xmath157 .",
    "however , now we have to update the potential after every accepted step at each site of the system , which costs @xmath158 .",
    "this means that this approach works better when the acceptance rate is low .",
    "combining these two approaches allows us to effectively perform simulations for the system with long - range ci at both high and low temperatures and even in @xmath11 space .      in this section",
    "we shall describe our main results : the evolution of the system with lowering temperature in different regimes .",
    "we shall use several presentations : images for distributions of solitons and spins .",
    "these pictures will be further characterized by plotting the numbers of nearest spins or solitons .      here",
    "we consider a system with a size @xmath159 sites and a concentration of neutral solitons @xmath160 .    to demonstrate explicitly the formation and multiplication of domain walls",
    ", we shall show the patterns of soliton density ( fig.[figwalls]a , c , e ) , which is of our direct interest , and also the patterns of the reversed spins of the effective ising model ( fig.[figwalls]b , d , f ) which give a useful complementary insight . here and below , the sites with the major orientation of spins will be left as blank space , while the sites with reversed spins will be marked in black .",
    "the edges of black areas in the longitudinal ( chains ) direction indicate the positions of kinks .    at higher temperatures ( @xmath161 , fig.[figwalls]a ,",
    "b ) we observe an ordered state impregnated by the gas of bisolitons .",
    "when the first pair of walls condenses ( at @xmath162 , fig.[figwalls]c , d ) , the concentration of noncondensed solitons drops , then with decreasing temperature it further decreases gradually , to cure the defects in already existing walls , then it drops sharply again with the formation of the next pair of walls ( @xmath163 , fig.[figwalls]e , f ) .",

    "however , it affects the large - scale structures such as domain walls , since for @xmath194 the wall formation becomes energetically unfavorable .",
    "in contrast to the cases of neutral solitons ( fig.[plotneighbvst8x8 ] ) and weak ci , we do not observe sharp wall formation transition for the intermediate values of the ci  the temperature dependence of the average number of neighbors does not show any jumps .",

    "as @xmath195 further increases , we do not observe plane walls , but only filamentary stripes , which are infinite along one transverse direction and finite along the other ( fig.[figwallscoulombwithdefects]b , recall that periodical boundary conditions are imposed ) .",
    "however , it is clear that an infinite system can not possess such infinite stripes , because they are inefficient in terms of the interchain energy @xmath12 .",
    "our interpretation for formation of lines rather than planes is that here the system demonstrates an extreme sensitivity of cis to the transverse finite - size geometry of the sample .",
    "a charged wall would create a constant electric field @xmath197 in the chains @xmath82 direction , whose repulsive force @xmath198 would oppose directly the attractive confinement force @xmath12 overpassing it at the intermediate ci , hence no stable planes could exist .",
    "however , forming the stripes ( in one transverse @xmath199 direction ) at the expense of the part of the confinement energy ( lost in the other transverse direction @xmath200 ) , the system generates a decreasing electric field @xmath201 which falls below the confinement force at sufficiently large distances , hence preserving this partial aggregation .",
    "therefore , in finite systems , the disintegration of plane walls happens via formation of linear structures . for infinite systems",
    ", we expect that these structures will further disintegrate into finite disks ( similar to described in the next paragraph ones ) .",

    "however new items appear in the @xmath11 case , those are domain walls with the chemical potential @xmath337 .",
    "@xmath338 is to be determined from the self - consistency condition @xmath339    even in the case @xmath340 , the wall term does not contribute to the sum as long as @xmath341 .",
    "however , as @xmath22 decreases , @xmath342 also has to decrease in order to accommodate all the solitons in the system . when @xmath343 reaches the value @xmath344 , the first wall condenses , and then @xmath343 stays at @xmath150 analogously to bose - einstein condensation , but in the real space instead of the reciprocal one .",
    "first , consider the unscreened case @xmath345 .",
    "then the summation in ( [ nu(mu)3d ] ) is convergent because of the two terms in the exponent : @xmath346 as it was already without ci , and now also @xmath347 from the ci .",
    "this sum is dominated by the minimal @xmath348 if either @xmath349 or @xmath350 .",
    "recall that our definition of a moderate ci means that it is not efficient at the level of minimal distances , i.e. @xmath351 , hence only the first inequality is sufficient .",
    "then @xmath352 and the estimation for the transverse aggregation temperature @xmath353 , obtained for the neutral case , still holds here .",
    "however , when the excess number of solitons condenses to first walls , for them , @xmath324 reaches the sample width @xmath144 .",
    "then for weak cis @xmath354 when it is still unimportant hence qualitatively never important at all .",
    "in this case @xmath44 only slightly decreases by @xmath355 .    for the moderate ci : @xmath356 walls do not form .",
    "we can estimate the maximum size of disks analogously to the @xmath1 case .",
    "when @xmath22 decreases , the chemical potential @xmath341 grows , then it reaches @xmath357 and continues to increase .",
    "this means that the sum ( [ nu(mu)3d ] ) is now determined by large values of @xmath324 and summation can be approximated by integration over @xmath324 , @xmath358 the exponent @xmath359 in ( [ int - nu-3d ] ) decreases even faster at large @xmath324 in comparison to the @xmath1 case , and the integral converges .",
    "@xmath360 has local extrema at points @xmath361 ( fig.[appendixb - plot ] ) . at some critical value @xmath362",
    "the local maximum becomes positive : @xmath363 , which means that large disks of radius @xmath364 appear in the system . in order to find the corresponding critical @xmath365 we use the saddle - point approximation for the integral over @xmath324 ( only region @xmath366 contributes in this case)@xmath367 at @xmath146 , @xmath368 decreases below the fixed concentration @xmath23 , which happens at @xmath369 ,",
    "then the large disks appear .",
    "now turn to the screened case . for @xmath370 ,",
    "the screening is not very important : it does not affect even the largest disks structure , but only affects the interactions among them .",
    "however , for @xmath237 , the screening becomes essential , since disks can grow up to @xmath371 and cis does not prevent their further growth , so they grow into domain walls .",
    "the wall term appears in the sum ( [ nu(mu)3d ] ) when the chemical potential reaches the value @xmath372 .",
    "so , as in the @xmath1 case , at @xmath237 there is just the shift of the chemical potential @xmath373 .      in conclusion , the very weak ci @xmath375 only shifts down the transition temperature @xmath44 not preventing the formation of the walls . for the intermediate ci @xmath376 , different regimes",
    "are observed depending on the screening length @xmath238 . for @xmath377 ,",
    "the ci is effectively unscreened , so it prevents the wall formation and only disks of maximum size of @xmath378 are observed . for @xmath237 ,",
    "the screened ci does not prevent them growing to transverse domain walls and only shifts the chemical potential .            c. h. ahn , a. bhattacharya , m. di ventra , j.n .",
