    "heavy - ion collision induced by a radioactive beam is one of the effective methods to determine the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy in experiment and theory .",
    "however , the determination of nuclear symmetry energy requires one to compare continuously theoretical simulations with experimental measurements . up to now , while efforts such as the fopi @xcite and fopi - land @xcite experiments have provided some data involving the probe of symmetry energy such as the ratio and the elliptic flow of nucleon , the corresponding theoretical simulations do not give consistent conclusions on the determination of symmetry energy especially for the determination of high - density symmetry energy . without considering the possibly introduced errors due to experimental environment , the main reasons are the possible uncertainty factors in theoretical predictions and/or model dependence in different theoretical communities .",
    "for example , by comparing the ratio with the fopi experimental data , the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) @xcite and boltzmann - langevin ( bl ) @xcite communities favor a supersoft symmetry energy , but the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite community suggests a superstiff symmetry energy .",
    "therefore , one needs to check these possible uncertainty factors of theoretical predictions to better determine the density dependence of symmetry energy .",
    "presently , many communities have attempted to solve this problem including studying the impact of in - medium pion potential @xcite , the isovector potential of @xmath2(1232 ) resonance @xcite , medium modification of pion production threshold @xcite , potential modification of local and/or global energy conservation of binary collisions @xcite , and tensor - force - induced short - range correlations @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "electromagnetic interactions play an important role in the time evolution of charged particles in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "for example , the coulomb field of spectators in peripheral collisions can lead to the well - known coulomb peaks in the rapidity distribution of ratio @xcite , and the elliptic flow splitting of charged pion mesons measured by star collaboration @xcite is closely related to chiral magnetic effects in relativistic energy collisions .",
    "moreover , it has been reported that a strong magnetic can be generated in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane ( i.e. , @xmath3 direction ) , regardless of intermediate energy or relativistic energy collisions @xcite . nevertheless , as has been guessed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the violent variable magnetic field in @xmath3 direction may generate a strong electric field , i.e. , an induced electric field , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "certainly , the changing of magnetic field in intermediate energy collisions is less violent than that in relativistic energy collisions ; thus the effects of the induced electric field on heavier charged particle are expected not to be obvious .",
    "however , due to the longer duration time of the induced electric field acting on charged particles compared to the case of relativistic energy collisions , it is therefore expected that the induced electric field will affect the lighter pion mesons and their ratio to some extent .",
    "in addition , while almost all the transport models have consistently concluded that the ratio is one of the most promising probes of symmetry energy especially for the high - density behavior of symmetry energy @xcite , the comparison of theoretical predictions with exiting data is still inconclusive . therefore , to extract reliably precise information from the ratio about the high - density symmetry energy , one needs to answer precisely whether and how the induced electric field affects the charged pion mesons and their ratio . to this end",
    ", we perform the au+au collisions to show the effects of the induced electric field on charged pion mesons and their ratio in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is shown later that while the induced electric field does not affect the total ratio , it suppresses ( enhances ) differential ratio in midrapidity ( forward and backward rapidities ) especially for very peripheral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the total ratio as the probe of symmetry energy is more delicate than the differential ratio due to the considered induced electric field factor .",
    "the present study is based on an isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model @xcite . in this model , an isospin - dependent mean - field",
    "is used to model the nuclear interaction ; its expression is defined as follows : @xmath4 in the above , @xmath5 is the nucleon number density and @xmath6 is the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear medium ; @xmath7 denotes the neutron ( proton ) density , the isospin @xmath8 is @xmath9 for neutrons and @xmath10 for protons , and @xmath11 is the local phase space distribution function .",
    "the expressions and values of the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and they lead to the binding energy of @xmath19 mev , incompressibility @xmath20 mev for symmetric nuclear matter , and the symmetry energy @xmath21 mev at saturation density @xmath22 @xmath23 . the parameter @xmath24 is used to mimic the different forms of symmetry energy predicted by various many - body theories without changing any property of symmetric nuclear matter and the value of symmetry energy at saturation density .     in au+au collisions at the impact parameter of 10fm ( a ) , and the impact parameter dependence of the central magnetic field @xmath25 in au+au collisions with a beam energy of 500mev / nucleon ( b ) .",

    "it can be seen that the magnetic field increases with increasing impact parameter and becomes more and more steep with increasing beam energy .",

    "almost all the pions are produced from the decay of @xmath2(1232 ) resonances .",
    "therefore , the dynamic pion ratio , i.e. , ( ) @xmath42 , can be defined as @xmath43 because all the @xmath2 resonances will eventually decay at the final reaction stage , the ( ) @xmath42 ratio will naturally become the ratio . shown in fig .",
    "[ tpion ] is the time evolution of dynamic ( ) @xmath42 ratio from central to peripheral au+au collisions at two beam energies of 400 mev / nucleon ( left panels ) and 1500mev / nucleon ( right panels ) .",
    "it can be seen that the induced electric field does not affect the total ratio at either the lower beam energy of 400mev / nucleon or the higher beam energy of 1500mev / nucleon .",
    "in fact , because the magnetic field itself does not change the total multiplicities of both positive and negative pion mesons as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it therefore can be understood that its derived product , i.e. , the induced electric field , is unlikely to alter the total ratio in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , just as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnetic field has a strong focusing ( diverging ) effects on positive ( negative ) pion mesons at forward ( backward ) rapidity ; therefore , the natural question is whether the induced electric field does affect the distribution of charged pion mesons and thus the distribution of the ratio . to this end",
    ", we define the percentage of @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities in different rapidities with and without the consideration of the induced electric field as follows : @xmath44 where index @xmath45 denotes @xmath0 or @xmath1 , @xmath46 is the reduced rapidity of particle @xmath45 , @xmath47 denotes the multiplicities of particle @xmath45 in rapidity interval of [ @xmath48,@xmath46 ] , and @xmath50 denotes the multiplicities of particle @xmath45 in all rapidity range . shown in figs .",
    "[ pimid1 ] and [ pimid2 ] are the impact - parameter - dependent percentage of @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities in midrapidity ( @xmath51 ) at beam energies of 400 and 1500 mev / nucleon .",
    "it can be seen that the induced electric field obviously reduces the midrapidity emission of @xmath0 mesons but enhances the midrapidity emission of @xmath1 mesons due to its opposite effects on @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , especially for the more peripheral and lower - energy collisions . within the beam - energy and impact - parameter dependence of the magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ em ] , one naturally expects that the effects of the induced electric field on charged pion mesons are increasing with increasing both the impact parameter and the beam energy .",
    "however , compared to the 400 mev / nucleon case , the effects of the induced electric field on charged pion mesons in midrapidity at 1500mev / nucleon are almost negligible .",
    "this is because while the increased magnetic field with the beam energy may generate a more strong induced electric field , the obviously decreased duration time of the reaction stage with the beam energy causes the acting time of the induced electric field on charged pion mesons to become shorter and thus leads to a negligible effect at the beam energy of 1500mev / nucleon . shown in figs .",
    "[ pifb1 ] and [ pifb2 ] are the corresponding impact - parameter - dependent percentage of @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities in forward and backward rapidities ( @xmath52 ) at beam energies of 400 and 1500 mev / nucleon .",
    "similar to the above observations from figs .",
    "[ pimid1 ] and [ pimid2 ] , the effects of the induced electric field on charged pion mesons in forward and backward rapidities at 1500 mev / nucleon are almost negligible , while for charged pion mesons in forward and backward rapidities at 400 mev / nucleon , the induced electric fields obviously enhance the emission of @xmath0 meson but reduce the emission of @xmath1 meson . naturally , the total multiplicities of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in all rapidity range and thus their total ratio are not affected by the induced electric field as shown in fig .",
    "[ tpion ] .",
    "this feature indicates that the total ratio is still a precisely reliable probe of the symmetry energy at both the lower and higher beam energies .",
    "however , for the differential ratio , due to the fact that the effects of the induced electric fields on it are obvious at the lower beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon but negligible at the higher beam energy of 1500 mev / nucleon , one naturally needs to look at the effects of the induced electric fields on their rapidity distribution at the beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon in the following .    shown in fig .",
    "[ rapidity ] is the rapidity distribution of the ratio in central to peripheral au+au collisions with and without the consideration of the induced electric field at the beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "it can be found that the induced electric fields indeed suppress the ratio in midrapidity but enhance the ratio in forward and backward rapidities especially for more peripheral collisions .",
    "this feature indicates that the differential ratio is less delicate than the total ratio in probing the symmetry energy .",
    "finally , to show more explicitly the effects of the induced electric fields on the differential ratio , we define a relative suppression factor as follows : @xmath53 obviously , @xmath54 will more clearly indicate the effects of the induced electric fields on the differential ratio because this ratio method will maximize the effects of the induced electric fields on the ratio due to its suppression effects on the ratio in midrapidity but enhancing effects on the ratio in forward and backward rapidity . on the other hand , considering that this ratio method can minimize the effects from both the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross section and the poorly known symmetry energy due to the pion mesons in different rapidities approximately experiencing the same influences from them , @xmath54 thus can be an effective probe of the induced electric fields generated in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "show in fig .",
    "[ f ] is the relative suppression factor in central to peripheral au+au collisions at a beam energy of 400mev / nucleon .",
    "it can be seen that the relative suppression factor @xmath54 increases with the impact parameter increasing due to the steeper magnetic field generating a stronger induced electric field in peripheral collisions .",
    "this feature indicates that the relative suppression factor @xmath54 can indeed be an effective probe of induced electric fields generated in heavy - ion collisions .                 in au+au collision with ( labeled as with ) and without ( labeled as w / o ) the consideration of the induced electric field at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "in summary , we have carried out an investigation about the effects of the electric field due to a variable magnetic field on the ratio in central to peripheral heavy - ion collisions . within an isospin- and momentum - dependent transport model ,",
    "the au+au collisions are performed at two beam energies of 400 and 1500 mev / nucleon .",
    "it is shown that , while the induced electric field does not affect the total ratio at both the lower and higher beam energies , it suppresses the differential ratio in midrapidity but enhances the differential ratio in forward and backward rapidities due to the reduced ( enhanced ) emission of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) meson in midrapidity but the enhanced ( reduced ) emission of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) meson in forward and backward rapidities .",
    "these findings imply that the total ratio is still a precisely reliable probe of symmetry energy , but the induced electric field should be considered in future studies of using the differential ratio as the probe of symmetry energy . moreover , because the relative suppression factor can not only minimize the effects of some uncertainty factors in heavy - ion collisions but also can maximize the effects of the induced electric field , therefore we may conclude that the relative suppression factor can be an effective probe of the induced electric field generated in heavy - ion collisions in future studies . + * acknowledgements * + g.f .",
