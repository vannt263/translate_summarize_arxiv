    "the physics of normal metals ( n ) in contact with superconductors ( s ) has been studied extensively for almost fifty years , and in the past two decades there has been somewhat of a resurgence of interest in this field .",
    "this has mainly been sparked by the realization of experiments that can directly probe the region close to the normal - superconducting ( ns ) interface at temperatures far below the transition temperature of the superconductor .",
    "such experiments have been possible thanks to microlithographic techniques that permit the building of heterostructures on a mesoscopic scale combined with transport measurements in the sub - kelvin regime .",
    "such hybrid structures exhibit various new phenomena , mainly due to the fact that physical properties of both the superconductor and the mesoscopic normal metal are strongly influenced by quantum coherence effects .",
    "the simplest physical picture of this system is that the superconductor tends to export some of its anomalous properties across the interface over a temperature dependent length scale that can be of the order of a micrometer at low temperatures .",
    "this is the so - called proximity effect , which has been the focus on numerous surveys ; both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite .",
    "the key concept to understand this effect  @xcite is andreev reflection . during this process ,",
    "when an electron from the vicinity of the fermi energy ( @xmath0 ) surface of the normal conductor hits the superconductor , the bulk energy gap @xmath1 of the superconductor prevents the negative charge from entering , unless a cooper pair is formed in the superconductor .",
    "since a cooper pair is composed of two electrons , an extra electron has to be taken from the fermi sea , thus creating a hole in the conduction band of the normal metal . physically and classically speaking",
    ", an andreev reflection therefore corresponds to a retroflection of the particle , where andreev reflected electrons ( or holes ) retrace their trajectories as holes ( or electrons ) .",
    "the effect of andreev reflection on the transport properties of open ns structures is an interesting and fruitful area ( see refs .   and references therein for example ) ,",
    "though in this paper we focus instead on closed structures . naturally this choice has the consequence of leaving aside some exciting recent results such as , for example , the statistical properties of the conductance  @xcite , the magneto - conductance in andreev quantum dots  @xcite , resonant tunneling  @xcite and the thermoelectrical effect  @xcite in andreev interferometers .    in closed systems ,",
    "one of the most noticeable manifestations of the proximity effect is the suppression of the density of states ( dos ) of the normal metal just above the fermi energy . although most of the experimental investigations have been carried out on disordered systems  @xcite , with recent technical advances interest has moved to structures with clean ballistic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this shift gives access to the experimental investigation of the so - called _",
    "andreev billiard_. while this term was originally coined  @xcite for an impurity - free normal conducting region entirely confined by a superconducting boundary , it also refers to a ballistic normal area ( _ i.e. _  a quantum dot ) with a boundary that is only partly connected to a superconductor . the considerable theoretical attention raised by such a hybrid structure in the past decade",
    "is related to the interesting peculiarity that by looking at the dos of an andreev billiard we can determine the nature of the underlying dynamics of its classical counterpart  @xcite . indeed , while the dos vanishes with a power law in energy for the integrable case , the spectrum of a chaotic billiard is expected to exhibit a true gap above @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the width of this hard gap , also called the minigap  @xcite , has been calculated as a purely quantum effect by using random matrix theory ( rmt ) and its value scales with the thouless energy , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the average ( classical ) dwell time a particle stays in the billiard between successive andreev reflections  @xcite .    since the existence of this gap",
    "is expected to be related to the chaotic nature of the electronic motion , many attempts have been undertaken to explain this result in semiclassical terms  @xcite , however this appeared to be rather complicated . indeed a traditional semiclassical treatment based on the so - called bohr - sommerfeld ( bs ) approximation yields only an exponential suppression of the dos  @xcite .",
    "this apparent contradiction of this prediction with the rmt one was resolved quite early by lodder and nazarov  @xcite who pointed out the existence of two different regimes .",
    "the characteristic time scale that governs the crossover between the two regimes is the ehrenfest time @xmath4 , which is the time scale that separates the evolution of wave packets following essentially the classical dynamics from longer time scales dominated by wave interference . in particular",
    "it is the ratio @xmath5 , that has to be considered .    in the universal regime ,",
    "@xmath6 , chaos sets in sufficiently rapidly and rmt is valid leading to the appearance of the aforementioned thouless gap  @xcite .",
    "although the thouless energy @xmath7 is related to a purely classical quantity , namely the average dwell time , we stress that the appearance of the minigap is a quantum mechanical effect , and consequently the gap closes if a symmetry breaking magnetic field is applied  @xcite .",
    "similarly if two superconductors are attached to the andreev billiard , the size of the gap will depend on the relative phase between the two superconductors , with the gap vanishing for a @xmath8-junction  @xcite .",
    "the deep classical limit is characterized by @xmath9 , and in this regime the suppression of the dos is exponential and well described by the bs approximation .",
    "the more interesting crossover regime of finite ehrenfest time , and the conjectured ehrenfest time gap dependence of ref .   have been investigated by various means  @xcite . due to the logarithmic nature of @xmath10 , investigating numerically",
    "the limit of large ehrenfest time is rather difficult , but a clear signature of the gap s ehrenfest time dependence has been obtained  @xcite for @xmath11 . from an analytical point of view rmt is inapplicable in the finite @xmath10 regime  @xcite , therefore new methods such as a stochastic method  @xcite using smooth disorder and sophisticated perturbation methods that include diffraction effects  @xcite have been used to tackle this problem . on the other hand",
    "a purely phenomenological model , effective rmt , has been developed  @xcite and predicts a gap size scaling with the ehrenfest energy @xmath12 .",
    "recently micklitz and altland  @xcite , based on a refinement of the quasiclassical approach and the eilenberger equation , succeeded to show the existence of a gap of width @xmath13 in the limit of large @xmath14 .",
    "consequently a complete picture of all the available regimes was still missing until recently when we treated the dos semiclassically  @xcite following the scattering approach  @xcite . starting for @xmath6 and going beyond the diagonal approximation we used an energy - dependent generalization of the work  @xcite on the moments of the transmission eigenvalues .",
    "the calculation is based on the evaluation of correlation functions also appearing in the moments of the wigner delay times  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the effect of finite ehrenfest time could be incorporated in this framework  @xcite leading to a microscopic confirmation of the @xmath10 dependence of the gap predicted by effective rmt .",
    "interestingly the transition between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is not smooth and a second gap at @xmath17 was observed for intermediate @xmath18 , providing us with certainly the most clear - cut signature of ehrenfest time effects .    in this paper",
    "we extend and detail the results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "first we discuss andreev billiards and their treatment using rmt and semiclassical techniques . for the dos in the universal regime ( @xmath15 )",
    "we first delve into the work of refs .   before using it to obtain the generating function of the correlation functions which are employed to derive the dos .",
    "this is done both in the absence and in the presence of a time reversal symmetry breaking magnetic field , and we also look at the case when the bulk superconducting gap and the excitation energy of the particle are comparable .",
    "we then treat andreev billiards connected to two superconducting contacts with a phase difference @xmath19 .",
    "the gap is shown to shrink with increasing phase difference due to the the accumulation of a phase along the trajectories that connect the two superconductors .",
    "finally the ehrenfest regime will be discussed , especially the appearance of a second intermediate gap for a certain range of @xmath18 .",
    "we will also show that this intermediate gap is very sensitive to the phase difference between the superconductors .",
    "since the treatment of andreev billiards was recently reviewed in ref .",
    "we just recall some useful details here .",
    "in particular the chaotic andreev billiard that we consider is treated within the scattering approach  @xcite where the ns interface is modelled with the help of a fictitious ideal lead .",
    "this lead permits the contact between the normal metal cavity ( with chaotic classical dynamics ) and the semi - infinite superconductor as depicted in fig .",
    "[ andreevbilliard]a .",
    "( a ) the andreev billiard consists of a chaotic normal metal ( n ) cavity attached to a superconductor ( s ) via a lead .",
    "( b ) at the ns interface between the normal metal and the superconductor electrons are retroreflected as holes . ]    using the continuity of the superconducting and normal wave function , we can construct the scattering matrix of the whole system . denoting the excitation energy of the electron above the fermi energy @xmath20 by @xmath21 and assuming that the lead supports @xmath22 channels ( transverse modes at the fermi energy ) , the scattering matrix of the whole normal region can be written in a joint electron - hole basis and reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unitary @xmath25 scattering matrix of the electrons ( and its complex conjugate @xmath26 that of the holes ) . as the electrons and holes remain uncoupled in the normal region the off - diagonal blocks are zero .",
    "instead , electrons and holes couple at the ns interface through andreev reflection  @xcite where electrons are retroreflected as holes and vice versa , as in fig .",
    "[ andreevbilliard]b . for energies",
    "@xmath21 smaller than the bulk superconductor gap @xmath1 there is no propagation into the superconductor and if we additionally assume @xmath27 we can encode the andreev reflection in the matrix @xmath28 @xmath29 the retroreflection ( of electrons as holes with the same channel index ) is accompanied by the phase shift @xmath30 . in the limit of perfect andreev reflection ( @xmath31 ) this phase shift reduces to @xmath32",

    "one powerful treatment uses random matrix theory .",
    "such an approach was initially considered in refs .   where the actual setup treated is depicted in fig .  [ andreevgeneralbilliard]a .",
    "it consists of a normal metal ( n ) connected to two superconductors ( s@xmath35 , s@xmath36 ) by narrow leads carrying @xmath37 and @xmath38 channels .",
    "the superconductors order parameters are considered to have phases @xmath39 , with a total phase difference @xmath19 .",
    "moreover a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath40 was applied to the normal part .",
    "we note that although this figure ( and fig .",

    "( b ) the semiclassical treatment involves classical trajectories retroreflected at the superconductors an arbitrary number of times . ]    as above , the limit @xmath41 was taken so that normal reflection at the ns interface can be neglected and the symmetric case in which both leads contain the same number , @xmath42 , of channels was considered  @xcite .",
    "finally it was also assumed that @xmath43 , valid in the limit @xmath44 .",

    "we note that though we stick to the case of perfect coupling here , the effect of tunnel barriers was also included in ref .  .",
    "the first step is to rewrite the scattering problem in terms of a low energy effective hamiltonian @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 hamiltonian of the isolated billiard and @xmath53 an @xmath54 coupling matrix .",
    "eventually the limit @xmath55 is taken and to mimic a chaotic system the matrix @xmath51 is replaced by a random matrix following the pandey - mehta distribution  @xcite @xmath56}\\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath57 measures the strength of the time - reversal symmetry breaking so we can investigate the crossover from the ensemble with time - reversal symmetry , the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , to that without , the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "it is related to the magnetic flux @xmath58 through the two - dimensional billiard of area a and with fermi velocity @xmath59 by @xmath60 here @xmath61 is a numerical constant of order unity depending only on the shape of the billiard .",
    "the critical flux is then defined via @xmath62 the density of states , divided for convenience by twice the mean density of states of the isolated billiard , can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the trace of a block of the green function of the effective hamiltonian of the scattering system and for simplicity here we express the energy in units of the thouless energy @xmath65 .",
    "this is averaged by integrating over ( [ pandeymehta ] ) using diagrammatic methods  @xcite , which to leading order in inverse channel number @xmath66 leads to the expression  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 with the critical magnetic flux @xmath70 for which the gap in the density of states closes ( at @xmath71 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ origrmteq ] ) may also be rewritten as a sixth order polynomial and when substituting into ( [ rmtdoseq ] ) , we should take the solution that tends to 1 for large energies .",
    "in particular , when there is no phase difference between the two leads ( @xmath71 , or equivalently when we consider a single lead carrying @xmath22 channels ) and no magnetic field in the cavity ( @xmath72 ) the density of states is given by a solution of the cubic equation @xmath73      the second approach , and that which we pursue and detail in this paper , is to use the semiclassical approximation to the scattering matrix which involves the classical trajectories that enter and leave the cavity  @xcite . using the general expression between the density of states and the scattering matrix  @xcite , the density of states of an andreev billiard reads  @xcite @xmath74 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 is twice the mean density of states of the isolated billiard ( around the fermi energy ) .",
    "equation  ( [ semidosstarteq ] ) should be understood as an averaged quantity over a small range of the fermi energy or slight variations of the billiard and for convergence reasons a small imaginary part is included in the energy @xmath21 . in the limit of perfect andreev reflection @xmath76 ,",
    "see ( [ alphadefeqn ] ) , and ( [ semidosstarteq ] ) reduces to @xmath77 obviously only even terms in the sum have a non - zero trace , and setting @xmath78 , dividing through by @xmath79 and expressing the energy in units of the thouless energy @xmath65 , this simplifies to  @xcite @xmath80 equation  ( [ dossemieqn ] ) involves the correlation functions of @xmath81 scattering matrices @xmath82}^n ,   \\label{singlecorr}\\ ] ] where we recall that the energy is measured relative to the fermi energy and that @xmath83 involves the average dwell time @xmath3 . for chaotic systems",
    "@xcite the dwell time can be expressed as @xmath84 in terms of the heisenberg time @xmath85 conjugate to the mean level spacing ( @xmath86 ) .    at this point",
    "it is important to observe that nonzero values of @xmath87 are necessary for the convergence of the expansion of the logarithm in ( [ semidosstarteq ] ) that led to ( [ dossemieqn ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we are particularly interested in small values of @xmath87 which puts ( [ dossemieqn ] ) on the edge of the radius of convergence , where it is highly oscillatory . the oscillatory behavior and a slow decay in @xmath81 is a direct consequence of the unitarity of the scattering matrix at @xmath88 ( in fact later it can also be shown that @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus a truncation of ( [ dossemieqn ] ) will differ markedly from the predicted rmt gap , which was the root of the difficulty of capturing the gap by previous semiclassical treatments  @xcite . in the present work we succeed in evaluating the entire sum and hence obtain results which are uniformly valid for all values of @xmath87 .    calculating the density of states",
    "is then reduced to the seemingly more complicated task of evaluating correlation functions semiclassically for all @xmath81 .",
    "luckily the treatment of such functions has advanced rapidly in the last few years  @xcite and we build on that solid basis .",
    "we also note that determining @xmath90 is a more general task than calculating the density of states .",
    "since the andreev reflection has already been encoded in the formalism before ( [ dossemieqn ] ) , the treatment of the @xmath90 no longer depends on the presence or absence of the superconducting material , but solely on the properties of the chaotic dynamics inside the normal metal billiard .        in the semiclassical approximation ,",
    "the elements of the scattering matrix are given by  @xcite @xmath91 where the sum runs over all classical trajectories @xmath92 starting in channel @xmath93 and ending in channel @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is the classical action of the trajectory @xmath92 at energy @xmath21 above the fermi energy and the amplitude @xmath96 contains the stability of the trajectory as well as the maslov phases  @xcite . after we substitute ( [ semiclscat ] ) into ( [ singlecorr ] ) and expand the action around the fermi energy up to first order in @xmath87 using @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the duration of the trajectory @xmath92 , the correlation functions are given semiclassically by a sum over @xmath99 trajectories @xmath100",
    "the final trace in ( [ singlecorr ] ) means that we identify @xmath101 and as the electron trajectories @xmath102 start at channel @xmath103 and end in channel @xmath104 while the primed hole trajectories @xmath105 go backwards starting in channel @xmath104 and ending in channel @xmath106 the trajectories fulfill a complete cycle , as in figs .",
    "[ twotrajectorystructures]a and  [ fourtrajectorystructures]a , d , g . the channels @xmath107",
    "will be referred to as incoming channels , while @xmath108 will be called outgoing channels .",
    "this refers to the direction of the electron trajectories at the channels and not necessarily to which lead the channel finds itself in ( when we have two leads as in fig .",
    "[ andreevgeneralbilliard ] ) .    the actions in ( [ singlesemiclcorr ] ) are taken at the fermi energy and the resulting phase is given by the difference of the sum of the actions of the unprimed trajectories and the sum of the actions of the primed ones . in the semiclassical limit of @xmath109 ( _ c.f . _  the rmt limit of @xmath55 ) this phase oscillates widely leading to cancellations when the averaging is applied , unless this total action difference is of the order of @xmath110 .",
    "the semiclassical treatment then involves finding sets of classical trajectories that can have such a small action difference and hence contribute consistently in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "as an example we show the original trajectory structure for @xmath111 in fig .  [ twotrajectorystructures]a , where for convenience we draw the incoming channels on the left and the outgoing channels on the right so that electrons travel to the right and holes to the left ( _ c.f . _  the shot noise in refs .  ) .",
    "of course the channels are really in the lead ( fig .",
    "[ andreevbilliard]a ) or either lead ( fig .",
    "[ andreevgeneralbilliard ] ) and the trajectory stretches involve many bounces at the normal boundary of the cavity .",
    "we draw such topological sketches as the semiclassical methods were first developed for transport  @xcite where typically we have @xmath112 ( complex conjugate transpose ) instead of @xmath113 ( complex conjugate ) in ( [ singlecorr ] ) , restricted to the transmission subblocks , so that all the trajectories would travel to the right in our sketches . without the magnetic field ,",
    "the billiard has time reversal symmetry and @xmath114 is symmetric , but this difference plays a role when we turn the magnetic field on later .",
    "an even more important difference is that in our problem any channel can be in any lead .    to obtain a small action difference , and a possible contribution in the semiclassical limit",
    ", the trajectories must be almost identical .",
    "this can be achieved for example by collapsing the electron trajectories directly onto the hole trajectories as in fig .",
    "[ twotrajectorystructures]b . inside the open circle , the holes still ` cross ' while the electrons ` avoid crossing ' , but by bringing the electron trajectories arbitrarily close together the set of trajectories can have an arbitrary small action difference .",
    "more accurately , the existence of partner trajectories follows from the hyperbolicity of the phase space dynamics .",
    "namely , given two electron trajectories that come close ( have an encounter ) in the phase space , one uses the local stable and unstable manifolds  @xcite to find the coordinates through which hole trajectories arrive along one electron trajectory and leave along the other , exactly as in fig .",
    "[ twotrajectorystructures]b ( and fig .",
    "[ andreevgeneralbilliard]b ) .",
    "these are the partner trajectories we pick for @xmath115 and @xmath116 when we evaluate @xmath117 from ( [ singlesemiclcorr ] ) in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "as the encounter involves two electron trajectories it is called a 2-encounter .",
    "an encounter can happen anywhere along the length of a trajectory .",
    "in particular , it can happen at the very beginning or the very end of a trajectory , in which case it is actually happening next to the lead , see figs .",
    "[ twotrajectorystructures]c , d .",
    "this situation is important as it will give an additional contribution to that of an encounter happening in the body of the billiard .",
    "we will refer to this situation as an ` encounter entering the lead ' .",
    "we note that if an encounter enters the lead the corresponding channels must coincide and we have diagonal - type pairs ( _ i.e. _  the trajectories are coupled exactly pairwise ) though it is worth bearing in mind that there is still a partial encounter happening near the lead as shown by the ehrenfest time treatment  @xcite .    to give a more representative example , consider the structure of trajectories for @xmath118 .",
    "for visualization purposes in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]a the original trajectories are arranged around a cylinder in the form of a cat s cradle .",
    "the incoming and outgoing channels are ordered around the circles at either end although they could physically be anywhere .",
    "projecting the structure into 2d we can draw it in several equivalent ways , for example as in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]d or  [ fourtrajectorystructures]g , and we must take care not to overcount such equivalent representations .",
    "we note that the ordering of the channels is uniquely defined by the closed cycle that the trajectories form . to create a small action difference",
    ", we can imagine pinching together the electron ( and hole ) strings in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]a .",
    "one possibility is to pinch two together in three places ( making three 2-encounters ) as in fig .",

    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]g .",
    "note that the collapse of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]d leads to a different structure with three 2-encounters .",
    "however in general it is not true that the different projections of the arrangement in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]a are in a one - to - one correspondence with all possible diagrams .    from figs .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]b , e we can create another possibility by sliding two of the 2-encounters together to make a 3-encounter ( or alternatively we could start by pinching three trajectories together in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]a as well as an additional pair ) as in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]c , f .",
    "finally we could combine both to a single 4-encounter .",
    "along with the possibilities where all the encounters are inside the system , we can progressively slide encounters into the leads , as we did for the @xmath111 case in fig .",
    "[ twotrajectorystructures ] , creating , among others , the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fourtrajectorystructureleads ] .        finally , we mention that so far we were listing only ` minimal ' diagrams .",
    "one can add more encounters to the above diagrams but we will see later that such arrangements contribute at a higher order in the inverse number of channels and are therefore subdominant .",

    "the pivotal step was to redraw the diagrams as rooted plane trees and to show that there is a one - to - one relation between them ( for the diagrams that contribute at leading order in inverse channel number ) . to redraw a diagram as a tree we start with a particular incoming channel @xmath120 as the root ( hence rooted trees ) and place the remaining channels in order around an anticlockwise loop ( hence plane ) . moving along the trajectory",
    "@xmath121 we draw each stretch as a link and each encounter as a node ( open circle ) until we reach @xmath122 .",

    "[ fourtrajectorystructures]i .",
    "note that marking the root only serves to eliminate overcounting and the final results do not depend on the particular choice of the root .",

    "<S> quantum cavities or dots have markedly different properties depending on whether their classical counterparts are chaotic or not . connecting a superconductor to such a cavity leads to notable proximity effects , particularly the appearance , predicted by random matrix theory , of a hard gap in the excitation spectrum of quantum chaotic systems . </S>",
    "<S> andreev billiards are interesting examples of such structures built with superconductors connected to a ballistic normal metal billiard since each time an electron hits the superconducting part it is retroreflected as a hole ( and vice - versa ) . using a semiclassical framework for systems with chaotic dynamics , we show how this reflection , along with the interference due to subtle correlations between the classical paths of electrons and holes inside the system , is ultimately responsible for the gap formation . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment can be extended to include the effects of a symmetry breaking magnetic field in the normal part of the billiard or an andreev billiard connected to two phase shifted superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we are able to see how these effects can remold and eventually suppress the gap . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the semiclassical framework is able to cover the effect of a finite ehrenfest time , which also causes the gap to shrink . </S>",
    "<S> however for intermediate values this leads to the appearance of a second hard gap - a clear signature of the ehrenfest time . </S>"
