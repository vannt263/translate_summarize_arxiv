    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on compton - gro has revolutionized our ideas about the location of gamma - ray bursts(grbs ) .",
    "the isotropy of the events and the paucity of week bursts strongly support the cosmological origin of grbs ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ; paczyski 1992 ; piran 1992 ; nemiroff et al .",
    "the most fascinating mechanisms for producing cosmological grbs is decelerations of ultra relativistic matter having a lorentz factor @xmath0 .",
    "this provides the only known solution to the compactness problem ( piran 1996 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ultra - relativistic matter is converted into internal energy by relativistic shocks .",
    "these shocks can be due to the inter stellar medium ( ism ) , `` external shocks '' or inside the shell itself due to non - uniform velocity `` internal shocks '' .",
    "electrons are heated by the shocks and the internal energy is then radiated via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering . though the ultra relativistic matter flow was originally considered in the dynamical context of fireball(shemi & piran 1990",
    "; paczyski 1990 ) , one can imagine grb models in which the fireball is replaced by some unknown non - thermal acceleration mechanism but the radiation still originate from slowing down of the ultra relativistic matter ( piran 1996 ) .",
    "most of bursts have a highly variable temporal profile with a time scale of variability @xmath1 significantly shorter than the overall duration @xmath2 .",
    "typical value is @xmath3 .",
    "clearly any grb model must be able to explain this complex temporal structure .",
    "the naive external shocks scenario requires only one uniform shell .",
    "the complex structure is due to surrounding matter ( ism in some models and star light in others ( shaviv & dar 1995 ) ) .",
    "two of us have shown that the efficiency of this process is less than @xmath4 ( sari & piran 1997a ) .",
    "using the observed variability scale @xmath1 one can estimate the typical size of a single emitter .",
    "the number of emitters must be less than the number of peaks .",
    "the total area of all emitters is therefore only a @xmath5 of the shell s area .",
    "even a modified version of this model , in which the shell is composed of many smaller shells that collide one after the other with the ism is impossible .",
    "most of the collisions would occur at a radius which satisfies @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total width of the shells and and the corresponding lorentz factors @xmath8 , are measured in the observer s rest frame .",
    "thermodynamic quantities are measured in the fluid rest frame . ] . at this radius angular",
    "spreading ( katz 1994 ; fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ) will cause each peak to be spread on time scale of @xmath9 which is also the total duration of the bursts .",
    "the observed bursts will therefor be smooth .",
    "the only way out , in the context of the external shock model is if the shell is replaced by a narrow and highly variable beam .",
    "however , the angular width of this beam bust be than @xmath10 !",
    "the obvious alternative is the internal shock scenario ( rees & mszros , 1994 ; narayan , paczyski & piran , 1992 ) .",
    "these shocks could occur within a variable relativistic wind produced by a highly variable source .",
    "internal shocks do not suffer from the angular spreading problem .",
    "a fast shell that was injected after a slower one will eventually catch up and collide with it .",
    "if both shells have lorentz factor of order @xmath11 , the time until collisions will be of order of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the initial separation between the shells .",
    "the collision will therefor occur at radius @xmath14 and the angular spreading time is of order of @xmath15 . since the total duration is given by the total width of the shells @xmath16 ,",
    "the observed peak width is considerably smaller than the total width and complex temporal structure is possible . in view of the difficulties within the external shock scenario",
    "it is worthwhile to consider the question whether internal shocks could actually produce the temporal structure observed in grbs and what would be the efficiency of this process .    to examine the energy conversion in internal shock",
    "we construct , following ( mochkovitch maitia & marques , 1995 ) a simple model in which the ultra - relativistic wind is represented by many shells having a random distribution of intrinsic parameters .",
    "we calculate the energy conversion due to shocks that form between the shells , considering at each time a binary ( two shells ) encounter .",
    "we show that internal shocks can produce the observed highly variable temporal profiles .",
    "we reproduce the result of mochkovitch , maitia & marques ( 1995 ) who concluded that the efficiency of this process is low @xmath17 if the spread in lorentz factors is small .",
    "however , we show that higher efficiency could be achieved if the spread in the lorentz factors of the ultra - relativistic matter is larger .",
    "we explore in section 2 the basic unit of our model , the interaction of two shells .",
    "we explain in section 3 the algorithm for evolution of multiple shells . in section 4 and 5",
    ", we discuss the temporal structure and the efficiency , respectively .",
    "finally we discuss the implication to observation in section 6 .",
    "internal shocks arise in a relativistic wind with a non uniform lorentz factor and convert a portion of the kinetic energy to a radiation .",
    "we represent the irregular wind by a succession of relativistic shells .",
    "a collision of two shells is the elementary process in our model .",
    "a rapid shell ( denoted by the subscript @xmath18 ) catches up a slower one ( @xmath19 ) and the two merge to form a single one ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the system behaves like an inelastic collision between two masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 . using conservation of energy and momentum we calculate the lorentz factor of the merged shell to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the lorentz factors and the masses of these shells .",
    "the internal energy of the merged shell is the difference of kinetic energy before and after the collision : @xmath26 the efficiency of conversion of the kinetic energy into the internal energy in a single collision is given by @xmath27    the emitted radiation will be observed as a pulse with a width @xmath1 .",
    "three time scales , the cooling time , the hydrodynamic time , and the angular spreading time determine @xmath1 .",
    ", all the observed time scales are stretched by a factor @xmath28 . however , as we are interested mainly in the ration between the width of the peaks and the overall duration and in the efficiency energy conversion this factor is unimportant . ] the internal energy is radiated via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering . in most of cases , the cooling time scale of electrons is much shorter than the hydrodynamic time scale ( sari et al .",
    "1996 ; sari & piran 1997b ) , so we can neglect the cooling time .",
    "the hydrodynamic time scale is the time that the shock crosses the shell .",
    "in fact there are two shocks as the interaction between the two shells takes place in the form of two shocks : a forward shock and a reverse shock . using conservation of mass , energy and momentum at the shocks and equality of pressures and velocities along the contact discontinuity",
    ", one can derive the lorentz factors of the forward and the reverse shocks @xmath29 ( sari & piran 1995 ) : @xmath30 for simplicity , we estimate the emission time scale by the time that the reverse shock crosses the rapid shell : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a width of the rapid shell .",
    "the emitting region moves towards the observer , the observed time scale is shorter by a factor of @xmath33 . if both shells have lorentz factor of order @xmath34 , this observed time scale is of order @xmath35 .    if the collision of the shells takes place at a large radius @xmath36 , angular spreading effects the width of the pulse .",
    "the separation of the shells is @xmath13 , the effect of angular spreading on the pulse width is @xmath37 as we mentioned in section 1 .",
    "if the separation @xmath13 is larger than the width of the shells @xmath38 , the pulse width @xmath1 is determined by angular spreading .",
    "the shape of the pulse become asymmetric with a fast rise and a slower decline ( fig .",
    "1 ) which grbs typically show .",
    "the peak amplitude is given by @xmath39 . if angular spreading is significant , the amplitude is lower by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "the observed luminosity , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 , & ( $ 0<t<\\delta t_e/2\\gamma_{m}^2 $ ) , \\cr h\\left [ { 1/(1+(2\\gamma_{m}^2 t-\\delta t_e)c / r)^2 } -{1/(1 + 2\\gamma_{m}^2ct / r)^2 } \\right ] , & ( $ t > \\delta t_e/2\\gamma_{m}^2 $ ) , \\cr } \\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the internal energy produced by the collision is radiated isotropically in the shell s rest frame .",
    "we also assume that all the internal energy is radiated rapidly . in this case",
    "we obtain at the end of the collision a single cold shell whose lorentz factor is @xmath44 , given by eq .",
    "[ gammam ] .",
    "the shocks compress the initial shells and it results in a thinner shell with a width @xmath45 : @xmath46 the density is discontinuous through the contact discontinuity .",
    "for simplicity we average the density : @xmath47 we describe the resulting shell as a homogeneous shell with a constant density @xmath48 and a lorentz factor @xmath44 .    while the shells propagate , their density decrease due to the spherical geometry .",
    "however the density ratio between any two shells remain constant and the process depends just on the density ratio and not on the absolute value of the density . we expect therefor that this one dimensional model captures the basic features of realistic events .",
    "we represent the irregular wind by a succession of relativistic shells with a random distribution of lorentz factors and densities . a collision between two shells produce shocks which convert some of the kinetic energy of the shells to thermal energy .",
    "the thermal energy is then radiated via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering . in section 2 , we calculated the observed radiation produced by a collision between two shells . for multiple shells ,",
    "numerous collisions take place .",
    "each collision produces a pulse similar to that shown in fig . 1 .",
    "to construct the temporal structure in a given model we calculate the time sequence of the two shell collisions and we superimpose the resulting pulses from each collision .",
    "consider a wind consisting of @xmath49 shells .",
    "we assign an index @xmath50 , ( @xmath51 ) to each shell according to the order of the emission from the inner engine .",
    "each shell is characterized by four variables : a lorentz factor @xmath52 , a density @xmath53 , ( the shells are cold and therefore the pressure satisfies @xmath54 . ) a width @xmath55 and the time , @xmath56 , when the shell was ejected from the source .",
    "we choose the origin of time such that the last shell - the n - th shell - is emitted at @xmath57 .",
    "clearly all other shells are emitted earlier so the @xmath56 s are negative for @xmath58 . at @xmath59",
    "the shells are at the following `` initial '' positions ( inner edge ) : @xmath60 .",
    "we denote the distance at this stage between the shell @xmath50 and the shell @xmath61 by @xmath62 : @xmath63 .",
    "the time @xmath64 corresponds to the period that the `` inner engine '' has operated , while @xmath65 corresponds to the period for which the `` inner engine '' was quiet .",
    "the size of the inner engine should be , of course , smaller than @xmath38 to produce a shell with a width @xmath38 .",
    "we turn now to evaluate the evolution of this multiple shell system .",
    "there will be numerous collisions between different shells .",
    "we denote by the index @xmath66 the @xmath66-th collision which takes place at a time @xmath67 and position @xmath68 . for simplicity",
    "we define a zeroth collision at the initial time @xmath69 this enables us to put the first collision on par with the rest .",
    "given the velocities of the shells @xmath70 and their separation @xmath71 at @xmath72 we calculate for all pairs @xmath73 satisfying @xmath74 the collision time : @xmath75 we then find the minimal collision time among all the @xmath76 s : @xmath77.\\ ] ] let @xmath19 and @xmath78 be the index of the shells for which this minimum takes place .",
    "the @xmath66-th collision is between the @xmath19 and @xmath78 shells and takes place at the time @xmath79 and at the position @xmath80 an observer at @xmath81 away from the central source will begin to detect radiation from this collision at a time @xmath82 note that , for reasons that will be clear later we give this observed time the index @xmath19 of the outer shell that participated in the collision . at the end of the computation we set the minimum of @xmath83 to be the origin of the observer time as this",
    "is when the first radiation is observed .",
    "we assign the pulse shape presented in section 2 beginning at this time to the overall observed signal .",
    "we rearrange the shells after each collision as follows .",
    "each shell moves from its earlier position @xmath84 to @xmath85 for the first collision @xmath86 and we use the `` initial positions '' here . all the shells except the @xmath19 shell and the @xmath78 shell keep their lorentz factor , the density and the width : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath19 and the @xmath78 shell merge to form a single shell which we label @xmath78 .",
    "we delete the @xmath19 shell and we will skip from now on this index when it will be encountered . using the results of section 2 we calculate now the new parameters for the @xmath78 shell : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we return now to the calculation of the distances between shells : @xmath62 and the corresponding collision time @xmath76 .",
    "we find the next collision and proceed until there are no more collisions , i.e. , until all the shells have merged to form a single shell or until the shells are ordered with increasing values of the lorentz factor .    in order to reduce the number of parameters describing the wind we adopt the following simplifications .",
    "we assume a constant initial width @xmath91 and constant initial separation @xmath92 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the `` inner engine '' operates for a fixed period @xmath93 and then it is quiet for a fixed period @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the lorentz factor of each shell is uniformly distributed between @xmath94 and @xmath95 . for the distribution of the density",
    "we have two kinds of models . in the first kind",
    "we consider models in which the density , the mass or the energy of each shell is a random variable which is uniformly distributed between @xmath96 and some maximal value @xmath97 . in the second kind",
    "the density is correlated with the lorentz factor as @xmath98 so that the mass and kinetic energy of each shell are proportional to @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively .. for @xmath101 the shells have equal density , for @xmath102 the shells have equal mass and for @xmath103 the shells have equal energy .",
    "we will see later that the random density / mass / energy models give almost same efficiency as the corresponding constant model , and the dependence on @xmath97 is low .",
    "we therefore present most of the result for the correlation models which are more simple .",
    "any time scale in this system is proportional to a sum of @xmath13 and @xmath38 , the amplitudes of observed peaks depends neither on the absolute value of @xmath38 nor that of @xmath13 .",
    "if both of @xmath13 and @xmath38 are transformed by the same factor , we will get similar temporal profile .",
    "we are interested in neither the absolute value of the duration nor that of the peak , then we can use a single parameter @xmath104 instead of the two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath38 .",
    "the efficiency of the energy conversion by the shocks is independent of @xmath104 .",
    "the total energy emitted is the sum of the energy emitted in the elementary two shell collisions which are independent of @xmath104 .",
    "the density @xmath105 is the only quantity in this system with dimensions of mass .",
    "therefore only density ratio rather than density can determine the time scale , and the overall normalization of the density @xmath105 is also unimportant .",
    "consequently we find that there are only five initial parameters : @xmath49 , @xmath104 , @xmath95 , @xmath94 and either @xmath106 ( if the density is correlated with the lorentz factor ) or @xmath97 ( for random distribution of @xmath105,@xmath20 or @xmath107 ) .",
    "the calculated temporal structure is a superposition of the pulses from the elementary two shell collisions .",
    "several typical temporal profiles are presented in figs . 2a-2f .",
    "2a depicts the luminosity for a model with @xmath108 and @xmath109 as a function of the observed time for shells with a constant energy ( @xmath103 ) . during the evolution of the @xmath49 shells",
    ", almost @xmath49 collisions happen and almost @xmath49 pulses are produced . though some of the peaks are not observed because of their higher neighbors .",
    "the number of peaks is given by @xmath110 . in fig .",
    "2b the luminosity is plotted with the same parameters as fig .",
    "2a except that @xmath111 .",
    "fig 2a and 2b show that @xmath49 practically determines the number of peaks .",
    "the width of a given peak @xmath112 is determined by the emission time scale @xmath113 or by the angular spreading @xmath37 .",
    "if the value of the separation @xmath13 is larger than that of the width @xmath38 , @xmath114 is @xmath115 and independent of @xmath116 . in fig .",
    "2c , the luminosity is plotted with the same parameters as fig .",
    "2b except that @xmath117 .",
    "the profile is almost independent of @xmath104 .",
    "the different amplitude of the peaks originate mainly from the difference in @xmath118 , since all peaks have width of the same order of magnitude @xmath119 . for",
    "given random lorentz factors , @xmath118 depends on the index @xmath120 for models with density correlated to the lorentz factor .",
    "the random lorentz factors are uniformly distributed between @xmath94 and @xmath121 . if @xmath122 , the ratio @xmath123 is typically large .",
    "in such a case , we obtain a simple formula , @xmath124 for @xmath103 , @xmath118 takes almost the same value for most of the collisions so most of the peaks have comparable amplitude ( see fig .",
    "thus , for @xmath103 we practically observe the `` shell structure '' produced by the inner source as almost all two shell collisions produce an observable peak . if on the other hand @xmath101",
    "( see fig .",
    "2d ) a few collisions produce significantly higher peaks than others and only those are observed .",
    "thus the number of the observed peaks is much less than @xmath49 , the observed temporal structure corresponds only weakly to the activity of the inner source .",
    "visual inspection suggests that the temporal structure produced by @xmath103 resembles better the observed temporal structure .",
    "2e and fig .",
    "2f present the luminosity profiles for model with random energy and random density respectively .. both use @xmath125 and both with spread of lorentz factor @xmath126 . again the random density is more spiky than the random energy case .",
    "however as could be guessed intuitively , the random energy and the random density cases are more spiky than the constant energy ( @xmath103 , fig . 2a ) and constant density ( @xmath101 , fig .",
    "2d ) respectively ..    the total width of the wind is @xmath127 .",
    "neighboring shells collide on a time scale of @xmath128 , with fluctuations of the same order of magnitude due to the fluctuations of @xmath34 .",
    "the matter is moving toward the observer , the resulting observed time scale is @xmath15 . on the other hand , the difference in observed time due to the location of the given shell within the wind is a order of @xmath129 .",
    "since by definition @xmath130 we observe pulses arising from collision between shells mostly according to their positions inside the wind , i.e. , according to the time that those shells were emitted by the inner engine . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the time that radiation is observed from a shell @xmath83 versus the time that the shell was ejected from the source @xmath131 .",
    "we associated the emission from a given collision with the slower shell .",
    "the clear correlation between the observed time and the time that the source ejected the specific shell shows that the observed temporal structure reflects the activity of the source .",
    "this conclusion is valid even if there is a large spread in @xmath34 .",
    "we have shown that internal shocks could produce the highly variable temporal structure .",
    "we ask now what is the efficiency of this process ?",
    "the relativistic shells collide with each other and merge into more massive shells .",
    "the overall efficiency of conversion of kinetic energy in internal shocks can be calculated from the initial and final kinetic energies as : @xmath132 where the superscript @xmath133 and @xmath134 represent the initial and final values , respectively .",
    "this efficiency depends on the parameters of the model @xmath135 , @xmath121 and @xmath106 ( or @xmath136 and on the specific realization : the set of random lorentz factors that are assigned to each shell . for each choice of the parameters of the model",
    ", we have evaluates the efficiency for 100 realizations .",
    "the mean efficiency and its standard deviation are listed in table 1 .",
    "the efficiency is only a few percents if the spread in the lorentz factor is relatively low ( a factor of 2 - 3 ) .",
    "this agrees with results of mochkovitch , maitia and marques ( 1995 ) who concluded that the efficiency of this process is less than @xmath137 .",
    "however , higher efficiency could be reached if the spread in @xmath8 is larger .",
    "the spread required , for example , for @xmath138 is @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the efficiency is independent of @xmath104 , which is important only for the temporal structure . for models with density correlated with the lorentz factor",
    "the relevant parameters that determine the efficiency are @xmath49 , @xmath106 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( see table 1a ) . for the random density models",
    ", we evaluated the efficiency with @xmath142 to @xmath143 .",
    "the efficiency is almost independent of @xmath97 .",
    "it can be seen that the efficiencies of the models with random @xmath144 , @xmath20 and @xmath107 are very similar to those with @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively ( table 1b ) .    as the number of shells , @xmath49 , increases , the kinetic energy of relative motion of the final mergers becomes negligible .",
    "the efficiency approaches an asymptotic value .",
    "further if we consider large values of @xmath94 , the efficiency depends only on the ratio @xmath147 reaching an asymptotic value for large @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . for models with correlation between the density and the lorentz factor ,",
    "this asymptotic value depends only on the index @xmath106 . in the limits @xmath148 , a single shell carries all the energy of the system and the energy and momenta of the other shells are negligible .",
    "therefore , the massive shell is unaffected by collisions with the lighter ones .",
    "we expect a low efficiency in this limit ( fig .",
    "5 ) .    in order to understand the dependence of the efficiency on @xmath106 we consider a simplified model .",
    "let all the shell collide and merge into a single shell and only then emit the thermal energy as the radiation . using conservation of energy and momentum we can calculate the lorentz factor and the efficiency : @xmath149 @xmath150 averaging over the random variables @xmath52 , and assuming a large number of shells @xmath151 we obtain : @xmath152 this formula explains qualitatively the behavior of our numerical results . a comparison between the simulations in which the radiations is emitted right after each collision and the simplified single merge model is presented in fig .",
    "an interesting point to notice is that for many shell collision ( both in the numerical simulation and the simple model eq .",
    "[ analitic ] ) the most efficient case is where the shells have the same energy while for the two shell collision ( eq . [ two - shell - efficiency ] ) the highest efficiency is for shells with equal mass rather than equal energy .",
    "using a simple model , we have shown that internal shocks can produce the highly variable profile observed in most grbs .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the time at which we observe a pulse and the emission time of the corresponding shell from the inner engine .",
    "this correlation persists even when there is a large spread in the lorentz factor .",
    "thus the observed temporal structure reproduces the activity of the source .",
    "we have shown that the number of peaks is almost the same as the number of shells that the inner engine emitted .",
    "the separation between the peaks corresponds to the duration for which the inner engine was quiet .",
    "the variability of peaks height can tell as wether all shells have comparable energy ( low variability in observed peak heights ) or not . a systematic statistical study comparing the temporal structure produced by internal shocks with observations",
    "will be carried out in a subsequent paper .",
    "the efficiency of this process is low ( less than @xmath153 ) if the initial spread in @xmath34 is only a factor of two .",
    "however the efficiency could be much higher .",
    "the most efficient case is when the inner engine produces shells with comparable energy but with very different lorentz factors . in this case",
    "( @xmath103 , and spread of lorentz factor @xmath154 ) the efficiency is as high as @xmath155 . for a moderate spread of lorentz factor @xmath126 , with @xmath103 , the efficiency if @xmath156 .",
