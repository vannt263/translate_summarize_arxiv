    "in the currently accepted cosmological model , galaxy formation is intimately connected to the formation of the large - scale cosmic structure . to test this model",
    ", we need to measure the relative distribution of light and matter in the universe .",
    "the mass distribution on small scales , from galaxies to galaxy clusters , has been usually inferred by assuming that systems are in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "on very large scales , the mass overdensities are small enough that the linear theory of density perturbations can be used to measure the mass distribution from the relation between the mass density field and the peculiar velocities of galaxies @xcite .    on intermediate , mildly non - linear scales , @xmath0  mpc , km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 throughout .",
    "] neither the dynamical equilibrium hypothesis nor linear theory are valid .",
    "no robust way of measuring the mass distribution in this regime was available until the 1990s , when both gravitational lensing and the caustic technique were developed . here",
    ", we provide an overview of how the caustic technique came about and what it has contributed so far .",
    "galaxy cluster mass estimators measure either the total mass within a given radius @xmath2 or the mass radial profile . traditionally , both kinds of estimators are based on the assumption that the cluster is spherical and in dynamical equilibrium .    the virial theorem is usually applied when the number of galaxy redshifts is not large : the galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath3 and the cluster size @xmath2 are sufficient to yield an estimate of the cluster total mass @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "more accurate measurements require a surface term correction @xcite , which can decrease the estimated mass by a substantial factor ( @xmath6 , on average @xcite ) , and knowledge of the galaxy orbital distribution ; however , although this distribution can only be reasonably guessed in most cases , its uncertainty has only a modest impact ( @xmath7 ) on the final mass estimate .",
    "these uncertainties become an order of magnitude larger if the galaxies are not fair tracers of the mass distribution .    when the number of galaxy spectra is large enough that we can estimate the velocity dispersion profile",
    ", we can apply the jeans equations for a steady - state spherical system .",
    "the cumulative mass is @xmath8 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] however , as in the virial theorem , the application of equation ( [ eq : jeans ] ) requires the assumption of a relation between the galaxy number density profile and the mass density profile @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we do not usually know the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the longitudinal , azimuthal and radial components of the velocity @xmath14 of the galaxies , respectively , and the brackets indicate an average over the velocities of the galaxies in the volume @xmath15 centered on position @xmath16 from the cluster center . therefore , we can not measure @xmath17 without guessing @xmath18 , or vice versa .",
    "a common strategy is to measure the velocity distributions of different galaxy populations which are assumed to be in equilibrium and thus to trace the same gravitational potential .",
    "this method can help to break this mass - anisotropy degeneracy , although not completely ( see @xcite for very lucid reviews of these methods ) .",
    "we can estimate the mass profile when observations in the x - ray band provide the intracluster medium ( icm ) density @xmath19 and temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm yields a relation similar to equation ( [ eq : jeans ] ) @xmath21 \\ ;   \\label{eq : icm}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath23 the mean molecular weight , and @xmath24 the proton mass .",
    "note that the term analogous to @xmath25 , which appears in equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) , is now zero , because , unlike the galaxy orbits , the icm pressure is isotropic .",
    "when a sufficient angular resolution and energy sensitivity are not available to measure the x - ray spectrum at different clustrocentric radius and thus estimate the temperature profile , an isothermal icm is usually assumed .",
    "however , the departure from this assumption appears to be substantial in most clusters where the density and temperature structures can be measured ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for estimating the cluster mass when detailed observations of the cluster are unavailable , we can use a scaling relation between the mass and an observable average quantity .",
    "the most commonly used scaling relations are those involving icm thermal properties , as the x - ray temperature ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite for reviews ) . in this case , however , the complex thermal structure of the icm can significantly bias the cluster mass estimate @xcite . rather than using an x - ray observable , one could use , in principle , the integrated sunyaev - zeldovich effect , which yields a correlation with mass which is tighter than the mass - x - ray temperature correlation @xcite .",
    "however , this correlation is currently valid only for simulated clusters , and still needs to be confirmed by upcoming cluster surveys .",
    "the astrophysical relevance of galaxies as gravitational lenses was first intuited by zwicky @xcite , but it was only fifty years later that the first gravitational lens effect was measured in a galaxy cluster @xcite .",
    "the lensing effect is a distortion of the optical images of sources beyond the mass concentration ; this distortion depends only on the amount of mass along the line - of - sight and not on the dynamical state of this mass .",
    "the obvious advantage is thus that the dynamical equilibrium assumption , that is essential for all the methods listed above , becomes now unnecessary .",
    "the lensing effect can be classified as strong or weak lensing , depending on its intensity .",
    "strong lensing creates multiple images of a single source and can be used for measuring the cluster mass in its core , where the gravitational potential is deep enough . in the outer regions ,",
    "the lensing effect is weaker and it only yields a tangential distortion of the induced ellipticities of the shape of the background galaxies ; weak lensing can thus measure the depth of the potential well from the center to the cluster outskirts .",
    "the most serious disadvantage of gravitational lensing for measuring masses is that the signal intensity depends on the relative distances between observer , lens and source , and not all the clusters can clearly be in the appropriate position to provide lens effects that are easily measurable .",
    "moreover , weak lensing does not generally have a large signal - to - noise ratio and weak lensing analyses are not trivial ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    in 1997 ,",
    "diaferio and geller @xcite proposed the caustic technique , a novel method to estimate the cluster mass which is not based on the dynamical equilibrium assumption and only requires galaxy celestial coordinates and redshifts . the method can thus measure the cluster mass on all the scales from the central region to well beyond the virial radius @xmath26 , the radius within which the average mass density is 200 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "prompted by the @xmath27-body simulations of van haarlem and van de weygaert",
    "@xcite , diaferio and geller @xcite noticed that in hierarchical models of structure formation , the velocity field in the regions surrounding the cluster is not perfectly radial , as expected in the spherical infall model @xcite , but has a substantial random component .",
    "this fact can be exploited to extract the escape velocity of galaxies from their distribution in redshift space . here",
    ", we will provide an overview of this method .",
    "it is clear that weak lensing and the caustic technique can be applied to scales larger than the virial radius because they do not depend on the assumption of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , the other estimators we mentioned above do not always measure the total cluster mass within @xmath26 , as , for example , the virial analyses , based on optical observations , usually do .",
    "x - ray estimates rarely go beyond @xmath28 , because on these larger scales the x - ray surface brightness becomes smaller than the x - ray telescope sensitivity ; gravitational lensing only measures the central mass within @xmath29 , where the strong regime applies .",
    "of course , scaling relations do not provide any information on the mass profile , but they rather provide the total mass within a given radius which depends on the scaling relation used : typically , x - ray , optical and sunyaev - zeldovich scaling relations yield masses within increasing radii , but still smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "the spherically symmetric infall onto an initial density perturbation is the simplest classical problem we encounter when we treat the formation of cosmic structure by gravitational instability in an expanding background @xcite .",
    "the solution to this problem provides two relevant results : the density profile of the resulting system and the mean mass density of the universe @xmath30 .",
    "the former issue has a long history that we do not review here ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is simple : we can imagine a spherical perturbation separated into individual spherical mass shells that expand to the maximum turn - around radius , the radius where the radial velocity @xmath31 equals the hubble velocity , before starting to collapse .",
    "this simple picture enables us to predict the density profile of the final object if we assume that mass is conserved , there is no shell crossing , and we know the initial density profile of the perturbation , namely the initial two - point mass correlation function @xmath32 ; @xmath32 contains the same information as the power spectrum @xmath33 of the mass density perturbations , if these are gaussian variates . for scale - free initial power spectra @xmath34 , the final density profile is @xmath35 with @xmath36 depending on @xmath30 and @xmath37 .",
    "the spherically symmetric infall can also be used to estimate @xmath30 . when the average mass overdensity @xmath38 within the radius @xmath39 of the perturbation is small enough",
    ", we can compute the radial velocity of each shell of radius @xmath39 according to linear theory @xmath40 in the simplest application of this relation to real systems , we assume that galaxies trace mass , so that the galaxy number overdensity is simply related to @xmath41 ; a measure of @xmath42 thus promptly yields @xmath30 . in the 1980s",
    "this strategy was applied to the virgo cluster and the local supercluster ; galaxies in these systems are close enough that we can measure galaxy distances @xmath43 independently of redshift @xmath44 , and thus estimate the projection along the line of sight , @xmath45 , of the radial velocity @xmath46 .",
    "these analyses indicated that @xmath47 @xcite , in agreement with the most recent estimates @xcite , but at odds with the inflationary value @xmath48 , which , at that time , was commonly believed to be the `` correct '' value .",
    "a slight complication derives from the fact that the external regions of clusters are not properly described by linear theory .",
    "we can use instead the spherical infall model . in this case ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath30 are still separable quantities and we can recast equation ( [ eq : vpec - lin ] ) as @xmath49 so that we can still measure @xmath30 once @xmath41 is known .",
    "typical approximations are @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "a more serious complication is that departures from spherical symmetry can be large in real systems and the radial velocities @xmath46 derived from their line - of - sight components can be affected by relative uncertainties of the order of 50% @xcite .",
    "the measure of absolute distances to galaxies remains a difficult problem today .",
    "thus , estimating @xmath30 from the infall regions of clusters might not be trivial .",
    "however , this complication can be bypassed by the intuition of regs and geller @xcite who were inspired by the work of shectman @xcite , kaiser @xcite and ostriker _ et al .",
    "kaiser showed that when observed in redshift space ( specifically the line - of - sight velocities of galaxies @xmath44 versus their clustrocentric angular distance @xmath52 ) , the infall pattern around a rich cluster appears as a `` trumpet horn '' whose amplitude @xmath53 decreases with @xmath52 .",
    "the turn - around radius is identified by the condition @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "for the abell cluster a539 , ostriker _",
    "_ @xcite found the turn - around radius @xmath55  mpc .",
    "although the galaxy sampling in the infall region of this cluster was too sparse to measure @xmath30 ( they only set a lower limit @xmath56 with equation [ eq : vpec - nonlin ] ) , the proposed strategy was intriguing , because it was showed that measuring galaxy distances independently of redshift was unnecessary .    ) in the coma cluster ( lower panels ) .",
    "the symbols show the galaxy positions in the redshift diagram .",
    "larger amplitudes correspond to increasing cosmic densities @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the mass overdensity @xmath41 is estimated from the galaxy number densities ( upper panels ) based on cfa data ( left panels ) , or apm data ( right panels ) . from @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    regs and geller @xcite quantified this intuition by showing that the relation between the galaxy number density @xmath60 in real space and the galaxy number density @xmath61 in redshift space is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the jacobian of the transformation from real to redshift space coordinates . when @xmath64 , @xmath61 is infinite .",
    "this condition locates the borders of kaiser s horn which are named _",
    "caustics_. we can now use equation ( [ eq : vpec - nonlin ] ) to relate @xmath53 to @xmath30 ( equation 34 of @xcite ) : @xmath65^{-1/2 } \\label{eq : regos}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath52 are related by the transformation from real to redshift space coordinates .",
    "unfortunately , the caustics appeared to be very fuzzy when a sufficiently dense sampling of the infall region of a rich cluster like coma was obtained @xcite ; consequently , the measure of @xmath30 was rather uncertain ( figure [ fig : vanhaarl93 ] ) .",
    "this disappointing result was attributed to the fact that the assumption of spherical symmetry is very poorly satisfied and that the substructure surrounding the cluster distorts the radial velocity field @xcite ( figure [ fig : vanhaarl93b ] ) .",
    "being so sensitive to the cluster shape , locating the caustics in the redshift diagram did not appear to be a promising strategy to measure @xmath30 .",
    "a breakthrough came when diaferio and geller @xcite took a step further than van haarlem and van de weygaert .",
    "in hierarchical clustering scenarios , clusters accrete mass episodically and anisotropically @xcite rather than through the gentle infall of spherical shells .",
    "moreover , clusters accrete galaxy groups with their own internal motion .",
    "therefore , the velocity field of the infall region can have substantial non - radial and random components .",
    "these velocity components both make the caustic location fuzzy , and , more importantly , increase the caustic amplitude when compared to the spherical infall model .",
    "this intuition opened the way to interpret the square of the caustic amplitude @xmath66 as the average , over the volume @xmath15 , of the square of the line - of - sight component of the escape velocity @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath68 is the gravitational potential profile and @xmath69 ( equation [ eq : gbeta ] ) is a function of the velocity parameter anisotropy @xmath18 .",
    "the crucial point here is that the equation @xmath70 holds _ independently of the dynamical state of the cluster_.    this interpretation works amazingly well .",
    "figure [ fig : vesc ] shows the results of @xmath27-body simulations of the formation and evolution of a galaxy cluster in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models with different cosmological parameters .",
    "the caustic amplitude ( crosses ) and @xmath71 ( solid lines ) , as a function of the projected distance @xmath72 , agree at all scales out to ten virial radii @xmath73 in these plots . ] and independently of the dynamical state of the cluster : immediately after a major merging ( upper panels ) or at equilibrium ( lower panels ) .",
    "the spherical infall model ( dashed lines ) , which should only hold for @xmath74 , always severely underestimates the actual caustic amplitude .",
    "these simulations and those in @xcite also show another relevant result : the major effect of the cluster shape is not to make the caustics fuzzy but rather to yield different caustic amplitudes depending on the line of sight .",
    "the identification @xmath70 can be immediately used to measure the cluster mass . if we assume spherical symmetry , the cumulative total mass @xmath17 is @xmath75 however , in realistic situations , the two logarithmic derivatives are comparable , and we thus need to know @xmath18 : this is generally not the case . moreover , the most serious obstacle in using equation ( [ eq : dphi ] ) is the fact that sparse sampling and background and foreground galaxies yield the estimate of @xmath76 too noisy to extract accurate information from its differentiation .    to bypass this problem ,",
    "diaferio and geller @xcite suggested a different recipe to estimate the cumulative mass @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant .",
    "this recipe has been applied to a large number of clusters ever since and it is now becoming a popular tool to measure the mass in the cluster infall regions .",
    "below , we justify this recipe and show how it works in practice .",
    "in hierarchical clustering models of structure formation , clusters form by the aggregation of smaller systems accreting onto the cluster from the surrounding region . the accretion does not happen purely radially and galaxies within the falling clumps have velocities with substantial non - radial components .",
    "specifically , these velocities depend both on the tidal fields of the surrounding region and on the gravitational potential of the clusters and the groups where the galaxies reside .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that , when viewed in the redshift diagram , galaxies populate a region with a characteristic trumpet shape whose amplitude , which decreases with increasing @xmath39 , is related to the escape velocity from the cluster region .",
    "the escape velocity @xmath79 , where @xmath68 is the gravitational potential originated by the cluster , is a non - increasing function of @xmath39 , because gravity is always attractive and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we can identify the square of the amplitude @xmath81 at the projected radius @xmath72 as the average of the square of the line - of - sight component @xmath82 of the escape velocity at the three - dimensional radius @xmath83 . to relate @xmath82 to @xmath68 , we need the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath18 ( equation [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "if the cluster rotation is negligible , we have @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . by substituting this relation into equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 where @xmath87 by applying this relation to the escape velocity at radius @xmath39 , @xmath88 , and by assuming that @xmath89 , we obtain the fundamental relation between the gravitational potential @xmath68 and the observable caustic amplitude @xmath90 @xmath91    to infer the cluster mass to very large radii , one first notices that the mass of a shell of infinitesimal thickness @xmath92 can be cast in the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 therefore the mass profile is @xmath95 where @xmath96 .    equation ( [ eq : rig - massprof ] ) however only relates the mass profile to the density profile of a spherical system and one profile can not be inferred without knowing the other .",
    "we can solve this impasse by noticing that , in hierarchical clustering scenarios , @xmath97 is not a strong function of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen in the case of the navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) @xcite mass density profile , which is an excellent description of the dark matter distribution in these models : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a scale - length parameter .",
    "if clusters form through hierarchical clustering , @xmath100 is also a slowly changing function of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we can then assume , somewhat strongly , that @xmath101 altogether and adopt the recipe @xmath102 when @xmath103 , this recipe proves to yield mass profiles accurate to 50% or better both in @xmath27-body simulations and in real clusters , when compared with masses obtained with standard methods , namely jeans equation , x - ray and gravitational lensing , applied on scales where the validities of these methods overlap @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate to emphasize that equations ( [ eq : rig - pot ] ) and ( [ eq : rig - massprof ] ) are rigorously correct , whereas equation ( [ eq : recipe - massprof ] ) is a heuristic recipe for the estimation of the mass profile .",

    "we progressively remove the background and foreground galaxies .",
    "we identify the cluster members by computing the velocity dispersion @xmath3 of the galaxies still on the main branch at each step : @xmath3 remains roughly constant when we move through the binary tree sector which only contains the cluster member ( figure [ fig : thresholds ] ) , because the cluster is approximately isothermal .",

    "a flat @xmath134 profile beyond @xmath140 mpc was also found in a1644 in the @xmath141-band @xcite .",
    "these results are due to two reasons : ( 1 ) a larger predominance of less luminous late - type galaxies in the cluster outer regions ; and ( 2 ) the fact that the @xmath137-band @xmath134 ratio of real galaxy systems increases with the system mass @xcite . in fact , clusters form by accretion of smaller systems , as indicated for example by the optical and x - ray observations of the a2199 complex @xcite , and as expected in current hierarchical models of structure formation @xcite ; therefore , the cluster surrounding regions , which mostly contain galaxy groups , should naturally have smaller @xmath134 .",
    "the positive @xmath142mass correlation was also obtained in semi - analytical models of galaxy formation @xcite and is well described by the statistical technique based on the conditional luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the infall regions are the transition between the dense cluster regions and the field @xcite , and the internal properties of galaxies do not vary abruptly at the virial radius @xcite . therefore galaxy surveys in the outskirts of clusters , as those mentioned above , can clearly constrain models of cluster and galaxy formation .",
    "the caustic method and gravitational lensing are the only two techniques currently available for measuring the mass profile of clusters beyond their virial radius .",
    "the caustic method requires a sufficiently dense redshift survey with a large field of view and is only limited by the time needed to measure a large enough number of galaxy spectra ; this observing time increases quickly with cluster redshift . on the other hand",
    ", lensing requires wide - field photometric surveys that need high angular resolution and extremely good observing conditions ; moreover , the lensing signal is strong enough only when the cluster is within a limited redshift range @xmath143 .",
    "when the caustic technique was proposed , multi - object spectroscopy was not routinely applied to measure galaxy redshifts , and the request of 100 or more redshifts in the outskirts of clusters appeared demanding .",
    "nowadays this task can be accomplished more easily and the popularity of the caustic technique has begun to increase .",
    "the caustic technique has been tested on @xmath27-body simulations and the mass profiles are accurate to better than @xmath130 out to @xmath144 . on the three systems where both the caustic method and lensing could be applied , the two methods yield consistent mass profiles .",
    "this consistency also holds in cl  0024 whose x - ray mass profile disagrees with the caustic and lensing profiles ; this disagreement is most likely due to the fact that this cluster is out of equilibrium and thus the x - ray mass is unreliable .",
    "the uncertainties on the caustic mass profile are almost totally due to projection effects .",
    "in fact , the method assumes that the cluster is spherically symmetric , and this is rarely the case ; therefore the redshift diagram from which the caustic mass is extracted can vary substantially when the cluster is observed along different lines of sight .",
    "the size of this systematic error is comparable to the systematic uncertainty we have with lensing methods which measure all the mass projected along the line of sight .",
    "what the caustic technique actually measures is the line - of - sight component of the escape velocity from the cluster ( equation [ eq : rig - pot ] ) .",
    "if we can measure the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath25 , the caustic technique thus yields a direct measure of the profile of the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "this brief review shows that the caustic technique is a powerful tool for the analysis of clusters and their external regions , but its full potentiality still needs to be exploited .",
    "for example , the @xmath3 plateau , that appears when walking along the binary tree ( figure [ fig : thresholds ] ) , provides a clean way to identify the cluster members .",
    "this issue still needs a throughout investigation @xcite , but very preliminary results , based on a large sample of synthetic clusters , show that @xmath145 of the galaxies within the caustics are cluster members and that the interloper contamination is comparable or lower than other methods @xcite .",
    "an additional byproduct of the caustic machinery is the identification of cluster substructures from the distribution of the galaxies in the binary tree @xcite .",
    "this topic has also been currently investigated @xcite .",
