    "one of the main goals of the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions is the determination of the density and momentum dependence of the real and imaginary part of the nucleon ( and other hadron ) optical potential ( often also termed nuclear equation of state ) @xcite .",
    "its importance stretches well beyond nuclear physics and is of great importance for the formation of nuclear matter after the big bang , the behaviour of supernovae and neutron stars .",
    "it also is important for the quest for the quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions .",
    "an increasing number of observables which are accessible through heavy ion collisions has been found to be sensitive to the equation of state : among the most prominent ones are collective flow effects such as the bounce  off of cold spectator matter _ in _ the reaction plane @xcite and the squeeze  out of hot and compressed participant matter _",
    "perpendicular _ to the reaction plane @xcite as well as particle production @xcite .",
    "the pion multiplicity was one of the first observables suggested to be sensitive to the nuclear equation of state @xcite .",
    "this was motivating a strong experimental effort ( @xmath2 analysis of streamer chamber events at the bevalac ) @xcite .",
    "however , the sensitivity of pion yields and spectra @xcite on the equation of state is not very high @xcite and therefore the attention shifted towards _ subthreshold _",
    "production of mesons ( e.g. kaons and @xmath3-mesons ) @xcite .",
    "new experimental @xmath4 setups at two of the major heavy ion reasearch facilities , gsi ( fopi , kaos , taps ) and lbl ( tpc ) , enable the investigation of the emission pattern and correlations of primary and secondary particles in a far more detailed manner than ever before .",

    "these transport models have been successful in studying various aspects of relativistic heavy ion collisions , such as single particle spectra , collective effects ( stopping , bounce ",

    "however , certain fluctuations and correlations , such as the formation of fragments in relativistic heavy ion collisions , can not be studied with a transport model based on a single  particle distribution function .",

    "are quite frequently bound in a delta resonance and in that intervals the real part of the pion optical potential is substituted by the real part of the @xmath0 optical potential .",
    "free intermediate and final charged pions experience coulomb forces which contribute to the real part of the pion optical potential .",
    "recent investigations on the influence of the nuclear medium correction to the dispersion relation of the free pion have shown conflicting results @xcite with respect to the importance of the modification for low momentum pions .",
    "however , both calculations show that the high energy part of the pion spectrum remains unchanged by this modification .",

    "@xmath0-matter _ is the @xmath63 loop , which , however , first has to be fueled by the @xmath64 process .",
    "the average pion passes approximately three times through this loop ( it has been created by the decay of a _ hard _",

    "the total multiplicity of @xmath0 resonances is just about 10% of the total nucleon multiplicity .",

    "less than 1% of the @xmath0s experience @xmath0 densities around 0.5 @xmath69 .",
    "however , enough @xmath0s are in the system to show signs of collectivity such as _ collective flow _ in the reaction plane .",
    "its measurable signiture ( the pion @xmath70 distribution in central collisions ) will be discussed in one of the follwing sections .",

    "the multiplicity increases linearly with the system mass .",

    "this is important for the extrapolation of total yields from spectra measured at @xmath83  if the midrapidity spectra are used to extrapolate ( with the assumption of a flat distribution ) the total yield may be underestimated by a factor of 2 .",
    "the anisotropy decreases when studying central collisions ( bottom ) .",
    "this dependence can be explained by the decay of @xmath0-resonances in the projectile- and target- spectator regions .",
    "the difference betweeen the distributions of @xmath74 and @xmath72 also results in a forward  backward peaking of the @xmath84 ratio .",

    "@xcite showed far larger disagreement between model and data .",
    "this was due to an improper normalization of the theoretical calculations .",
    "the yield of low @xmath1 pions in the heavy system is underpredicted by 10% .",
    "this is a common problem of most transport theories dealing with heavy ion collisions . suggested explanations for this underprediction include in - medium effects of pions in nuclear matter @xcite and the neglect of bose - enhancement due to the bosonic nature of the pions .",
    "the importance of the inclusion of coulomb forces and energy dependent @xmath86 cross sections can be shown by plotting the @xmath74 to @xmath72 ratio versus the transverse momentum @xmath1 ( figure [ picoulomb ] ) .",
    "the solid line shows the full calculation including coulomb forces . for high @xmath1 the @xmath87 ratio decreases towards 1 , whereas for low @xmath1 it increases to 2.5  considerably higher than the value of 1.8 predicted by the @xmath0-isobar model .",
    "the dashed line shows a calculation without coulomb forces .",
    "this ratio remains constant at 1.8 .",
    "the ( small ) remaining variations might be due to the different energy dependence of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 inelastic cross sections .",

    "transport model comparisons to the diogene data with the iqmd @xcite and the buu @xcite model have shown good agreement with the data .",
    "we have studied the origin of the particular shape of the pion angular distribution and the @xmath94 spectrum by sequentially suppressing first the _ soft - delta_-production and then the delta - absorption ( while allowing the _ soft - delta_-production ) . if we deactivate the _ soft  delta_production ( see figure 3 ) , @xmath96 , pions are neither scattered nor absorbed after the initial production .",
    "no @xmath94 for pions is observed . in order to decide whether the @xmath94 spectrum is caused by absorption or by scattering",

    "in contrast to previous publications , which investigated the asymmetric system ne(800amev)pb and suggested the anticorrelation of pionic and nucleonic @xmath94 at target rapidities to be caused by pion absorption @xcite , our investigation reveals the @xmath94 spectrum of the pions to be dominated by the pion scattering process @xcite .",
    "the following simplified picture can explain the origin of the observed phase space distribution : the @xmath0 decays isotropically in its rest  frame , therefore 50 % of the pions are emitted with a positive @xmath98 and 50 % with a negative @xmath98 . at target rapidity",
    "those pions which obtain a positive @xmath98value usually do not have the chance to rescatter : most of the target nucleons are located in the _ negative _ @xmath99 _ area ! _ those pions which _ do _ rescatter at target rapidity are the ones with an initially _ negative _ @xmath99 : every time a @xmath0 decays ( isotropically ) there is a 50% chance that this pion is emitted _ upward _ , i.e. into an azimuthal angle between @xmath100 .",
    "these @xmath101values characterize the hemisphere of positive @xmath102 , by definition .",
    "this leads for@xmath103 of the pions with  originally  negative @xmath102 to a shift towards a positive @xmath98 .",
    "this remains true even after transforming back into the laboratory frame .",
    "the same consideration applies vice versa for projectile rapidity : most projectile nucleons are located in the _ positive _ @xmath98 _ area_. the pions are rescattered in this area which results in a negative @xmath104 and a maximum in the azimuthal angular distribution in the @xmath105 interval .",

    "in contrast to ( semi- ) peripheral collisions , however , @xmath94 is correlated for pions and nucleons in central collisions because of the bounce  off of @xmath0-resonances",
    "the square markers in figure [ pipxeos ] depict a calculation with the hard equation of state without momentum dependence , the circles show the same equation of state including momentum dependence whereas the triangles represent a cascade calculation , i.e. a non - equilibrium free gas .",
    "the momentum dependence enhances the @xmath108 of the pions .",
    "this effect is due to the bounce  off of the @xmath0 resonances",
    "@xcite which in our model is enhanced because the momentum dependence for the @xmath0 resonances is included in the same way as for the nucleons .",
    "the cascade calculation , however , shows the opposite behaviour .",
    "the @xmath109 of the pions has negative sign to that of the calculations with the density dependent equations of state .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by the lack of hadron collective flow in cascade calculations @xcite .",
    "the pions would then be expected to be emitted isotropically ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , pion scattering from small caps of spectator matter being present at impact parameters around 3 fm causes the observed anticorrelation @xcite . in order to investigate the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state and in order to show the differences between cascade calculations and calculations including the equation of state more clearly we use",

    "the momentum transfer @xmath111 shows a systematic difference between the hard and soft equation of state .",
    "however , very high statistics and high precision impact parameter classification are necessary to experimentally exploit this sensitivity towards the determination of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "the results of figures [ piflow ] and [ pipxdir ] show clearly that even in the domain of particle production ( @xmath114 ) cascade simulations predict distinctly different phase space distributions for baryons and mesons at central impact parameters .",
    "now let us investigate particle emission perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "the hydrodynamical model predicted a squeeze  out of high energetic nucleons perpendicular to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "this effect , which has also been predicted by qmd ",
    "calculations @xcite and has been confirmed by experiment @xcite , is due to the high compression of nuclear matter in the central hot and dense reaction zone ( it is a genuinly collective effect , increasing linearly with @xmath115 ) .",

    "the azimuthal ( @xmath116 ) distribution of the pions is plotted to investigate this question .",

    "we observe a good qualitative agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experiment .",
    "it should be noted , however , that both , theory and experiment , need much better statistics to allow a conclusive quantitative comparison .",
    "the magnitude of the observed anisotropy and its dependence on impact parameter and transverse momentum is best studied by using the following ratio : @xmath129 for positive @xmath130 values pions are emitted preferentially perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "figure [ pisqr ] shows the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath130 for au+au collisions with an impact parameters bewteen b=5 fm and b=10 fm and at midrapidity ( @xmath131 ) : in contrast to pions with low transverse momentum , which are emitted preferentially in the reaction plane , high @xmath1 pions are preferentially emitted perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "this effect is stronger for @xmath72 than for @xmath74 .",
    "the difference is due to the different @xmath65 production cross section for @xmath72 and @xmath74 and due to coulomb forces pushing the @xmath72 away from the spectator matter which is located mostly in the reaction plane .",
    "the @xmath74 on the other hand are being attracted by those spectator - protons .",
    "these effects decrease the number of @xmath74 leaving the reaction zone in a direction perpendicular to the reaction - plane . however , the statistics accumulated so far are not large enough for a more detailed study of the differences between positive and negative pions .",
    "the inlay of figure [ pisqr ] shows recent measurements from the kaos collaboration @xcite which confirm the predicted systematics of the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "imposing the limited acceptance of the kaos spectrometer on the iqmd calculations would reduce the available statistics by one order of magnitude .",
    "experimental uncertainties in the determination of the proper reaction plane result in a reduction of the measured @xmath130 values which are difficult to compensate .",
    "therefore a direct quantitative comparison between the kaos measurements and iqmd calculations is not feasable at this point of time .",
    "we have investigated the cause of the observed preferential emission perpendicular to the reaction plane : pion absorption as well as scattering can be eliminated by deactivating the reaction @xmath96 , then no sqeeze - out is observed .    in order to decide whether the anisotropy is caused by absorption or by scattering the reaction @xmath132 can be deactivated .",
    "thus pion absorption is suppressed but scattering is allowed : no anisotropy is observed .",
    "therefore we conclude that the anisotropy is dominated by the pion absorption process @xcite .",
    "figure [ pindel ] shows the distribution of the number of delta generations @xmath133 a pion goes through before its freeze out . here",
    "@xmath133 is shown for @xmath72 emitted both in the reaction plane as well as perpendicular to it .",
    "@xmath134 is therefore the number of times a pion scatters before freeze out .",
    "we observe that 90% of the produced pions scatter at least once before leaving the reaction zone .",
    "a large number of pions scatters even more often , 2% up to 10 times ! the observed preferential emission perpendicular to the reaction plane is due to an excess of high @xmath1 pions which on the average have undergone fewer collisions ( @xmath135 ) than the pions in plane .",
    "those pions which make this effect do rescatter rarely , they are emitted early but carry information on the high density phase of the reaction .",
    "they stem from the decay of the most massive delta resonances which are mostly produced early on in the reaction @xcite .",
    "therefore high @xmath1 pions emitted perpendicular to the event - plane should be the most sensitive pionic probes for the investigation of the hot and early reaction zone .",
    "figure [ piphieos1 ] shows the azimuthal angular distribution of high @xmath1 ( @xmath136 mev ) neutral pions at midrapidity and impact parameter b=6 fm .",
    "the different curves show calculations for hard ( circles ) and soft ( squares ) equations of state ( including momentum dependence ) and a cascade calculation ( triangles ) .",
    "@xmath116 is the angle between the transverse momentum vector @xmath117 and the @xmath118-axis ( which lies in the reaction plane and is perpendicular to the beam axis ) .",
    "the out  of  plane pion squeeze  out is clearly seen by the pronounced maximum at @xmath137 for both equations of state . to enhance the statistics all particles are projected into the @xmath138 hemisphere . the full and dashed lines are least square fits with the function @xmath139 which has been used to fit the squeeze  out phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the curves show an extrapolation to the full azimuthal angular range .",
    "the distributions are normalized per particle in order subtract the influence of different equations of state on the pion multiplicity . within error - bars",
    "both equations of state exhibit the same out  of  plane pion squeeze  out .",
    "there is a trend for the hard equation of state to exhibit an enhanced out  of  plane pion squeeze  out but this trend might be too small to be useful for an experimental distinction between the different equations of state , whereas ",
    "in contrast  the in  plane pion bounce ",
    "off shows a clear difference for the two cases ( see above ) .",
    "the cascade calculation does not exhibit any significant out  of  plane pion squeeze  out for b=6 fm ! however , for larger impact parameters also cascade calculations exhibits a pronounced out  of  plane pion squeeze  out ( figure [ pisqb ] ) .",
    "figure [ pisqb ] shows @xmath130 versus impact parameter b for the hard equation of state with and without momentum dependence of the real part of the nucleon optical potential .",
    "the momentum dependence causes a drastic increase of @xmath130 for impact parameters larger than 3 fm . in the cascade calculation",
    "the onset of the out  of  plane pion squeeze  out is shifted toward larger impact parameters as compared to the calculations including the equation of state ( see also figure [ piphieos1 ] ) . for peripheral collisions",
    "@xmath130 reaches the same magnitude for the cascade calculation and the hard equation of state without momentum dependence .",
    "the physics responsible for the in  plane _ pion _ bounce  off ( pion scattering ) and the out  of  plane _ pion _ squeeze  out ( pion absorpion ) differs completely from the compressional effects governing the in  plane _",
    "nucleon _ bounce  off and out  of  plane _ nucleon _ squeeze  out .",
    "it is the pion ",
    "nucleon interaction which creates the sensitivity towards the density and momentum dependence of the nucleon optical potential .",
    "therefore it is understandable that we observe a strong sensitivity towards the equation of state _ in _ the reaction plane whereas the sensitivity towards the equation of state _ perpendicular _ to the reaction plane is limited to the momentum dependence : the ( anti- ) correlation in ",
    "plane is caused by multiple pion nucleon scattering @xcite with the bounced  off nucleons , which show a strong sensitvity towards momentum and density dependence @xcite . the pion squeeze  out perpendicular to the reaction plane , however , is dominated by high @xmath1 pions which have undergone less rescattering than those in the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "the abundance of these high @xmath1 pions is correlated to the multiplicity of high @xmath1 nucleons which increases if the density dependence is included .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of _ pionic _ in  plane bounce  off and out  of  plane squeeze  out on the _ nuclear _ equation of state . a strong sensitivity towards the _ density dependence _ is observed for the in  plane _ pion _ bounce  off whereas the out  of  plane _ pion _ squeeze  out shows only a small sensitivity .",
    "both effects show a strong sensitivity toward the _ momentum dependence_. cascade caluculations  which we see as a crude approximation to qmd  give different phase space distributions for pions in both cases .",
    "it should be easy to resolve experimentally these two clearly qualitatively different distinct scenarios .",
    "the determination of the equation of state will require  on the other hand ",
    "a more sensitive ( and sensible ) quantitative comparison to theory , including a improved treatment of the @xmath0 and pion optical potential .",
    "the nuclear equation of state can not be extracted from one observable alone .",
    "all observables known to be sensitive to the equation of state have to be fitted simultaneously by the respective model in order to claim success . in this article we have added additional , here _ pionic _ , observables which have to be taken into account for obtaining the final goal : the nuclear equation of state .",
