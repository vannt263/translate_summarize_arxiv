    "there are many objects on the sky , especially in the halo of the milky way ( mw ) , whose nature is not clear to us .",
    "some of those objects are hard to address observationally , and for others there is just no conclusive theoretical explanation .",
    "in fact , simply by looking at a colour - selected sample of stars within a region of the sky it is sometimes not easy to determine the true extent of a stellar system , mostly since it lacks a clear cut - off in its surface density profile .",
    "the same holds true for the determination of its velocity dispersion through a sub - sample of stars with readily measured radial velocities .",
    "these uncertainties typically result in discussions and speculations about a best - fitting density profile as well as a system s true tidal radius ( e.g. @xcite ) , and also about the true mass - to - light ratios of such systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some of these uncertainties arise from peculiar surface density profiles .",
    "that is , even though many objects in the milky way halo are well limited and show a well defined surface density profile with a slope of about @xmath1 in the region of the tidal radius , some objects obey shallow surface density profiles in the outskirts , having slopes of about -1 to -2 , like for example the mw globular clusters palomar 5 @xcite , ngc 5466 ,",
    "m 15 , m 53 , m 30 , and ngc 5053 @xcite , am 4 @xcite , whiting 1 @xcite , and ngc 1851 @xcite . the latter furthermore seems to be surrounded by a 500 pc halo of stars whose origin is unknown up to now .",
    "other uncertainties arise from unusual mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios of some stellar systems . while most globular clusters show mass - to - light ratios of 1 - 2 , ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) have higher m / l by a factor of about two , whereas dwarf spheroidal galaxies even show values of up to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these differences are usually ascribed to different dark matter contents , catastrophic tidal heating by gravitational shocks , a variation of the imf , tidally reshaped stellar phase - space distribution functions , contaminations from stellar streams in the mw halo , or alternative gravitational theories ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the low - mass galactic globular cluster palomar 13 is a stellar system which shows both , an unclear extent due to a shallow surface density profile , and a high velocity dispersion resulting in a mass - to - light ratio of about 40 @xcite .",
    "further details on this cluster are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : palomar 13 ] . in this investigation",
    "we demonstrate by means of @xmath0-body calculations how these observational results can be explained without the need for dark matter , tidal heating , binaries or changes in the law of gravity . to this end",
    "we compute models of palomar 13 on various orbits about the galaxy that are consistent with its present - day distance and radial velocity with respect to the sun .",

    "moreover , it is among the faintest objects listed in the harris catalogue of milky way globular clusters @xcite . with an estimated mass of about 3000 @xmath7 ( assuming a mass - to - light ratio of unity ) it is one of the least massive globular clusters of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue with proper motion measurements that pal  13 is on an inclined , highly eccentric orbit about the milky way .",
    "thus , it most probably was subject to strong tidal disruption during the last few gyr . indeed , observations show further peculiarities about this specific cluster .",
    "first , the cluster shows an unusually high velocity dispersion and therefore a very high mass - to - light ratio , and second , its surface density profile differs from the ones of most other milky way globular clusters :    1 .   corresponding to data by @xcite , which we mainly use to compare with our computations , the cluster is located at galactic longitude of @xmath8 and galactic latitude of @xmath9 .",
    "its distance from the sun is @xmath10 kpc , placing it at a distance of @xmath11 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "pal  13 s radial velocity was determined by ct et al .  to be @xmath12 km / s using spectroscopic data of the high resolution echelle spectrometer at the keck telescope . in the same investigation ,",
    "its internal radial velocity dispersion was found to be @xmath13 km / s from a sample of 21 stars located within the cluster s inner 2 arcmin . within their best estimate of pal 13 s tidal radius of 26 arcmin , ct et al .  furthermore measured an absolute magnitude of @xmath14 mag .",
    "assuming pal  13 being in virial equilibrium , this would imply a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath15 .",
    ".  suggest that this unusually high velocity dispersion could be the consequence of either a catastrophic heating during a recent perigalacticon passage or the presence of a dark matter halo .",
    "+ 2 .   fig .",
    "[ sdpcfht ] shows the surface density profile as obtained with the 3.6 canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) by @xcite .",
    "the profile shows a shallow slope @xmath16 out to large radii ( 10 arcmin correspond to about 70 pc at the distance of pal  13 ) , markedly different to the much steeper slope @xmath17 found in most other surface density profiles of globular clusters ( compare , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this large extent of pal  13 can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , the stellar population at large radii can be part of the cluster such that pal  13 would be a very low concentrated cluster with a large tidal radius of about 26 arcmin [ 180 pc ] @xcite , or , second , pal  13 can be interpreted as having a very pronounced tidal debris and the cluster itself having a significantly smaller tidal radius of about 3 arcmin [ 20 pc ] @xcite . to check these oppositional proposals for consistency with theoretical expectations",
    ", we can make a first estimate of pal  13 s true tidal radius , @xmath18 , using @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , @xmath21 is pal  13 s present - day mass , and @xmath22 its angular velocity on its orbit about the milky way @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath23 when we assume that pal  13 has a mass of about @xmath24 and is on a circular orbit with an orbital velocity of about @xmath25 km / s at @xmath26 kpc .",
    "in fact , pal  13 is more likely to be on an eccentric orbit and hence may rather have a present - day tidal radius of about 50 - 100 pc when we take into account that its true angular velocity is likely to be lower than that of a circular orbit .",
    "thus , the theoretically expected range for pal 13 s tidal radius does not agree with either of the two observational estimates of ct et al . and siegel et al .       depicts the radial distance from the galactic centre within the galactic disk and @xmath27 is the height above the galactic disk . shown",
    "are the last 3 gyr and 0.5 gyr into the future .",
    "also shown is the resulting orbit after setting the transverse velocity , @xmath28 , to zero , such that the cluster has only the ( more precisely determined ) radial velocity measured by ct et al .",
    "( _ orbit  2 _ ) .",
    "the black dotted line depicts the orbit with the transverse velocity chosen such that it minimizes pal 13 s orbital velocity , @xmath29 , referred to as _ orbit  3_.,width=317 ]    the hypothesis that the above peculiarities are caused by tidal effects is supported by measurements of @xcite , who , using ccd photometry and 40 years older photographic plates , find pal  13 s proper motion to be @xmath30 mas / yr and @xmath31 mas / yr . in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] the orbit of pal 13 within the milky way is shown in red solid lines for the case of combining the proper motion of siegel et al .  with the radial velocity of @xcite .",
    "note that we will refer to this orbit as _ orbit  1 _ throughout the text .",
    "the plotted line corresponds to the orbit integrated within an @xcite milky way potential for the last 3 gyr and 0.5 gyr into the future .",
    "distance and orbital motion of the sun where taken from @xcite , that is , the sun is located at a galactocentric distance of @xmath32 kpc , the orbital velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is 220 km / s in y - direction , and the sun moves with respect to the lsr with @xmath33 km / s , @xmath34 km / s and @xmath35 km / s .    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ orbits ] , corresponding to these measurements , pal  13 has a very elliptical orbit with eccentricity @xmath36 where @xmath37 is its apogalactic distance and @xmath38 its perigalactic distance , respectively .",
    "therefore , with a galactocentric distance of 25.3 kpc and the proper motion as measured by @xcite , pal 13 is today quite close to its perigalacticon .",
    "because of this , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the high velocity dispersion of pal 13 and the shallow slope of its surface density profile at large radii may well be due to the last pericentre passage which may have heated the cluster violently and may have caused a rapid expansion and/or an overspilling over the tidal boundaries .",
    "a comprehensive @xmath0-body investigation of low - mass globular clusters on eccentric orbits however shows that pericentre passages at such great galactocentric distances barely cause violent mass loss or rapid expansion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a follow - up investigation showed that the surface density profiles ( a ) can not be used to draw conclusions on the ( theoretical ) tidal radius of a cluster , and ( b ) only show shallow slopes at large radii when the cluster is close to reaching its apogalacticon @xcite .",
    "the latter is due to the tidal tails of the cluster which get stretched and compressed along the orbit .",
    "that is , if a cluster and its tails move from apogalacticon to perigalacticon they get accelerated and stretched , whereas from perigalacticon to apogalacticon they get decelerated and compressed .",
    "if the shallow slope in the surface density profile of pal  13 is indeed due to the effects described in @xcite , then pal 13 would need to be currently in a position close to apogalacticon .",
    "this , however , disagrees with the position in its orbit ( _ orbit  1 _ ) derived from the proper motion measured by siegel et al . and that puts pal 13 close to perigalacticon ( fig . [ orbits ] ) . in an attempt to resolve this contradiction",
    ", we will in the following define two further test orbits which differ in proper motion from the siegel et al . estimate .",
    "we will then fully integrate the dynamical evolution of pal 13 for all three orbits to compare the results with the observed surface brightness profile , luminosity , and radial velocity dispersion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the underlying assumption for this procedure is that the proper motion measurements are the most uncertain observed cluster properties .",
    "we first force the cluster s transverse velocity ( proper motion ) to zero , while keeping the radial velocity . in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] we can see that this results in an orbit which is less eccentric ( @xmath39 kpc , @xmath40 kpc , @xmath41 ) and in which the cluster today is closer to apogalacticon .",
    "we will refer to this orbit as _",
    "orbit  2_. in addition , we search for the proper motion values which minimize pal  13 s 3d orbital velocity , @xmath29 , since this would yield the orbit in which pal  13 is closest to apogalacticon .",
    "in fact , by doing this we get a more eccentric orbit as the cluster falls deeper into the galactic centre ( @xmath42 kpc , @xmath43 kpc , @xmath44 ) .",
    "this orbit will be referred to as _",
    "orbit 3_. it is also depicted in fig .  [ orbits ] , with the corresponding values for the proper motion being @xmath45 mas / yr and @xmath46 mas / yr .",
    "note that these values differ significantly from the values measured by @xcite by more than 1 mas / yr in each direction .",
    "for all three orbits , the cluster is coming from perigalacticon and approaching apogalacticon .",
    "but all three predict pal  13 to be in a different orbital phase , @xmath47 , which we here define as @xmath48 and which is constructed to be zero in perigalacticon and unity in apogalacticon .",
    "this factor @xmath47 gives the fraction of the radial distance between @xmath38 and @xmath37 at which a cluster is currently located . in this definition @xmath49",
    "is the time derivative of the galactocentric radius , which divided by its magnitude adds a minus sign to the orbital phase in case the cluster is moving from apogalacticon to perigalacticon . for circular orbits",
    "@xmath47 is always zero .",
    "we introduce the orbital phase , @xmath47 , here in addition to the orbital eccentricity , @xmath50 , since it appears crucial for the appearance of the observed effects @xcite . a systematic study on the dependence of the described effects on those two parameters will follow in a future investigation . for _ orbit 1 _",
    "we get @xmath51 , for _ orbit 2 _ @xmath52 , and for _ orbit 3 _ @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite introduce a template ( kkbh ) which can be used to reliably measure the slope of a surface density profile at large radii .",
    "the kkbh template reads as follows : @xmath54^{-\\gamma } \\times\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(r / r_c\\right)^2 } } - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(r_t / r_c\\right)^2 } } \\right]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for radii smaller than @xmath55 , and @xmath56^{-\\eta/64}\\ ] ] for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a constant , @xmath59 gives a core radius , @xmath60 the core slope inside @xmath59 , and @xmath18 a tidal radius ( which kpper et al .  name edge radius to avoid confusion with the theoretical tidal radius , since those two correlate only under certain circumstances ) .",
    "for radii larger than a fraction @xmath61 of @xmath18 the template changes into a power - law with slope @xmath4 .",
    "the exponent 64 in @xmath62 causes the template to change abruptly into the power - law slope at @xmath63 .",
    "kkbh is based on the template of @xcite but is modified in two steps : first it allows to have a power - law cusp in the core , and second it has an additional extra - tidal component in the form of a power - law slope .",
    "in this way , also more concentrated clusters can be represented for which the original king template fails , and furthermore the cluster profile can be fitted without being influenced by a dominant tidal debris .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sdpcfht ] where we applied a regular king template fit to the cfht data by ct et al .  and also a fit of kkbh , for the kkbh fit to allow for more flexibility at large radii , but as it turns out , this is only reasonable with highly resolved ( e.g. , @xmath0-body ) data . for",
    "less well resolved observational data with much fewer data points , it is more reasonable to reduce the number of fit parameters to a minimum .",
    "we therefore set the background , @xmath64 , mentioned in @xcite to zero , and in addition fix the break radius parameter @xmath61 to 0.5 , as was found by kpper et al .  to be the most plausible value .",
    "the king template gets significantly influenced by the stellar material at large radii and yields a tidal radius of more than 15 arcmin .",
    "the kkbh template assigns a power - law slope of @xmath65 to the tidal debris and yields a tidal radius of only 1.9 arcmin .",
    "+ by computing @xmath0-body models for all three kinds of orbits given above , and fitting the kkbh template in the same way to similarly resolved @xmath0-body data , we will try to reproduce this observed surface density slope @xmath4 .",

    "we set up 15 different cluster configurations using the publicly available tool mcluster ( kpper et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we used a tidally truncated plummer profile where we varied the cluster half - mass radius between 4 , 6 and 8 pc , and the initial mass between 3000 , 4000 , 5000 , 7500 and 10000 @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the mean mass of the cluster stars was in all cases about @xmath69 , thus the number of objects in the computations were a factor of three times higher .",
    "each of these 15 clusters was computed for the last 3 gyr on each of the three different orbits ( _ orbit  1 - 3 _ ) mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : palomar 13 ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ orbits ] ) .",
    "we focus on the last 3 gyr of evolution since we are only interested in the nearby tidal debris . using equation 18 of @xcite for the mean drift velocity of stars within the tidal tails , @xmath70 where @xmath20 is the gravitational constant",
    ", @xmath21 is the cluster mass and @xmath22 its angular velocity on its orbit about the milky way , we can estimate the length of the tidal tails after 3 gyr of evolution if the cluster was on a circular orbit . with the same values which we used in eq .",
    "[ eq : rt ] we get a drift velocity of about 0.77 pc / myr and thus a minimum length of the tails of 2.3 kpc in each direction from the cluster .",
    "note that this estimate gets complicated through the fact that pal  13 is most likely not on a circular orbit . through the acceleration and deceleration on an eccentric orbit the cluster - tail system",
    "gets periodically stretched and compressed .",
    "this estimate is therefore only a mean value of the length of the tails .",
    "anyway , for investigating the vicinity of pal  13 this timespan seems to be sufficient .    since we want to produce a realistic cmd of pal 13 with the appropriate photometric observables , we use the sse code @xcite in combination with mcluster to set up evolved stellar populations of 10 gyr age with a metallicity of @xmath6 = -1.9 $ ] .",
    "the populations are evolved from a canonical kroupa imf @xcite ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , where compact remnants are only kept if their kick velocity which gets assigned to them by sse does not exceed pal  13 s present - day escape velocity , @xmath73 , calculated using @xmath74 where @xmath21 is again the cluster mass and @xmath75 is the cluster s half - mass radius , respectively .",
    "this treatment is a bit arbitrary since we do not dynamically model the first 10 gyr of the cluster s life and the true retention fraction could be both , higher or lower .",
    "another simple treatment would be to keep all compact remnants which would have a slight effect on the observed mass - to - light ratio as the cluster would then have more mass than can be seen in stars .",
    "but only about 80 compact remnants get expelled from a @xmath76 cluster like we model here in the way described above , hence we consider this to be of secondary importance and concentrate on the case of low dark mass in the clusters .    those evolved clusters we then feed to nbody6 to evolve them further , chemically and dynamically , up to a total age of 13 gyr .",
    "in this way we can concentrate on the last few gyr of dynamical evolution of the cluster , which are most important for its present - day structure and nearby tidal debris .",
    "hence , we save computational time with this technique .",
    "a similar approach has been successfully tried by @xcite for the open cluster m67 .",
    "the stellar evolution of single stars within nbody6 is also calculated with sse , a consistent treatment of stellar evolution throughout the investigation is therefore guaranteed . from nbody6",
    "we finally extract the luminosities and stellar radii of all stars within the calculations to compute their effective temperatures and with this their colours and magnitudes in the johnson - cousins system @xcite .",
    "we use the algorithm described in @xcite to first derive the bolometric correction , @xmath77 , and the colour index , @xmath78 , and with this the absolute magnitude in the @xmath79-band , @xmath80 , and in the @xmath81-band , @xmath82 . together with the distance information of each star we can then derive the apparent magnitudes , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and",
    "can apply a realistic cut - off at a magnitude limit of , e.g. , @xmath68 mag as would be achieved by an 8m - class telescope in a few minutes of integration .",
    "since any observation obeys statistical and instrumental uncertainties , we furthermore apply a gaussian - distributed random error , d@xmath83 to each apparent magnitude , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which increases with decreasing brightness as @xmath84 this gives a minimum error of 0.02 mag , and an additional uncertainty which is of the order of 0.07 mag at 25 mag and decreases with increasing brightness . a final , synthetic colour - magnitude diagram of one of the clusters",

    "[ table1]-[table3 ] for the three orbital types .",

    "we can expect clusters with initial masses even higher than @xmath93 to exceed the observed absolute magnitude .",
    "this suggests that our range of initial parameters covers the right part of the parameter space of initial conditions .",
    "moreover , comparing the same clusters but on the different orbits , we find that the clusters evolve quite similarly internally and that their absolute magnitudes are only marginally influenced by the orbital type .",
    "in fact , at the beginning of the computations the clusters of a given mass and size are exactly the same clusters just on different orbits . in this way we make sure that differences come from dynamical evolution and not from stellar evolution .",
    "after 3 gyr the masses between the clusters of a given initial mass and size differ by only @xmath94 . from this we can deduce that the influence of the pericentre passages on all three orbits are rather unimportant . otherwise , the more eccentric orbits ( _ orbit  3 _ and _ orbit  1 _ ) would have induced more dissolution on those clusters , and altered the final absolute magnitudes more significantly .      from the computations we also take radial velocity dispersion measurements in the same way as @xcite have done .",

    "a star with a radial velocity differing more than 10 km / s from the other stars which have been drawn from the population would therefore be regarded as a non - cluster member , even though this does not necessarily hold true in our computations .",

    "we get values of about 2.2 km / s within @xmath95 for many clusters in the set .",
    "this is due to the number of unbound stars within the cluster , so - called potential escapers , and stars outside the tidal radius lying in projection within the inner 2 arcmin of the cluster , which pollute the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "this effect is more significant for the clusters which are initially more extended as they show more potential escapers .",
    "this is a consequence of them being energetically more affected by the pericentre passages ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the clusters on _ orbit  3",
    "_ indeed show much more extra - tidal material .",
    "looking at the right panels of fig .",
    "[ map_v10]-[map_min ] we see that there is barely any stellar material outside the cluster for _ orbit  1 _ ( fig .  [ map_v10 ] ) , and only little more for _ orbit  2 _ ( fig .",
    "[ map_v00 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to this , _",
    "orbit  3 _ shows a cluster with an unusual extra - tidal extent of several hundred parsec ( fig .",
    "[ map_min ] ) .",
    "this extra - tidal material results from the compression of the tidal tails as the cluster and its tails are being decelerated .",
    "this deceleration is so strong that the whole system consisting of cluster , leading tail , and trailing tail , is compressed to a few hundred pc .",
    "in fact , the system extends even further than can be seen in the figure and would extend much further if the @xmath0-body computations would have been made for the full 13 gyr since the tidal tails need many gyr to grow to such extent .",
    "note also , that the shape of this system is quite irregular since we look at a folded stellar stream and not at a bound structure in equilibrium .",
    "note that while our choice of the initial density profile may well affect the measured velocity dispersion , e.g. in case of a higher concentrated king model , it will not affect the appearance of the tidal debris .",
    "that is , the choice of profile may influence the internal structure of the cluster and also its mass loss rate but not its tidal debris since the debris is formed by orbital compression and not by the mass loss rate @xcite .",

    "[ sdpv10]-[sdpvmin ] .",
    "the figures show the projected stellar number density of the snapshots for all clusters except for the most massive ones , measured in rings around the cluster centres , just as @xcite have done it with their cfht data ( compare with fig .",
    "[ sdpcfht ] ) . for better comparison with the cfht data ,",
    "we subtract the same background of 0.69 stars / arcmin@xmath85 from our data instead of our lower estimate of 0.28 stars / arcmin@xmath85 since this background estimate is important for the outermost data points and therefore may influence the fit of the kkbh template .",
    "error bars in the figures give the square - root of these resulting values as statistical uncertainties .",
    "differences in the numbers of stars at small radii within this diagram mainly originate from the fact that cote et al .",
    "go down to @xmath99 mag with their cfht data whereas we cut at @xmath68 mag ( assuming that pal13 is observed with an 8 m class telescope ) .",
    "we fit a kkbh template to these surface density profiles in order to measure the slope of the extra - tidal material .",
    "the results of these fits are displayed in the figures ( @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath100 ) as well as in tab .",
    "[ table1]-[table3 ] .    the siegel orbit ( _ orbit  1 _ ) yields well limited clusters with steep slopes outside the tidal radius between @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "[ sdpv10 ] ) , just as expected from clusters near perigalacticon @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is no clear trend in the slopes with respect to the initial conditions .",
    "the differences are just the statistical fluctuations which kpper et al .  also found in their @xmath0-body data .",
    "the same holds true for _ orbit  2 _ ( fig .",
    "[ sdpv00 ] ) .",
    "just the scatter is a bit larger from @xmath103 to @xmath104 but , again , without any clear trend .",
    "if the slope at large radii was a consequence of the last pericentre passage , then we would expect a correlation of this slope with the initial half - mass radius , @xmath88 , of the cluster , since a more extended cluster should be more affected by tidal shocking and therefore produce a more pronounced tidal debris .",
    "in contrast to that , _",
    "orbit  3 _ results in quite different surface density profiles ( fig .",
    "[ sdpvmin ] ) .",
    "we get a shallow slope at large radii for all clusters with values as low as @xmath105 , and for the steepest not more than @xmath106 .",
    "that is , the clusters near apogalacticon differ significantly from the clusters which are closer to perigalacticon .",
    "such a behaviour of the surface density profile has been found in observations of other globular clusters as well .",
    "for instance , palomar  5 , which is known to be close to its apogalacticon , shows an @xmath4 of 1.5 @xcite . @xcite find 5 milky way globular clusters to show shallow values of @xmath4 at large radii , that is 2.44 for ngc 5466 , 1.59 for m 15 , 1.58 for m 53 , 1.41 for m 30 , and 0.62 for ngc 5053 .",
    "moreover , am 4 and whiting 1 both show an @xmath4 of 1.8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite furthermore find the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851 to be surrounded by a 500 pc halo of stars .",
    "its surface density profile shows a slope of @xmath107 .",
    "our investigation suggests that those clusters are all affected by this orbital effect .    from fig .",
    "[ sdpvmin ] we furthermore find that fitting a @xcite template to these clusters with the shallow slopes at large radii sometimes yields very different results for the tidal radius in comparison to the kkbh template ( e.g. for @xmath108 and @xmath109 pc we get @xmath110 arcmin and @xmath111 arcmin ) .",
    "this we have observed as well in the original data ( fig .",
    "[ sdpcfht ] ) and thus would be an explanation for the large uncertainties in pal  13 s tidal radius @xcite .",
    "+            judging by the different measurements we have performed on our artificial clusters ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ results ] ) we see that the cluster starting off with @xmath112 and @xmath109 pc on the orbit with the minimal orbital velocity agrees best with the observational values found by @xcite .",
    "the match is not perfect , though , and we do not conclude from our findings that pal  13 has to be on this specific orbit with these specific values for mass and radius used here .",
    "we rather demonstrate that most evidence points to pal  13 being in an orbital phase near apogalacticon ( in disagreement to the proper motion estimates by @xcite ) . assuming this solves the existing problems of pal  13 without",
    "further need for dark matter , binaries or changes in the law of gravity .",
    "nevertheless , although our results reproduce the observations of pal  13 without further ado , we have to check how the computational results change when adding binaries to the clusters .",
    "that is , pal  13 most likely has a significant binary population , which we have not modelled in our @xmath0-body calculations , but which should inflate the velocity dispersion further .",
    "in fact , @xcite measure significantly different radial velocities for some of the ct et al .",
    "sources with independent flames data .",
    "this might well be due to binary motion or , alternatively , to a different quality of the instruments used . from 7 stars which are available in both studies",
    "23 show significant variations , hinting at a high binary fraction .",
    "thus , blecha et al .",
    "get velocity dispersion values between 0.6 km / s and 0.9 km / s from samples of 58 stars .",
    "@xcite show that for the outer halo mw globular cluster palomar  14 the mean velocity dispersion measured from samples of 17 stars increases from about 0.5 km / s in the case of pal  14 being without binaries up to almost 4 km / s in the case of it having 100% binaries .",
    "thus , adding [ 20 , 40 , 60]% binaries to the cluster ( i.e. out of 100 systems in the cluster [ 20 , 40 , 60 ] are binaries ) increases the velocity dispersion by about [ 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 ] km / s when measured in this way . since both , pal  14 and pal  13 , are quite comparable in their expected virial - equilibrium velocity dispersion , the effect of their binary content on observations should be comparable , too . in fig .",
    "[ results ] we therefore additionally show the results from our investigation corrected for a binary fraction of 20% , 40% and 60% .",
    "the corrections , d@xmath113 , of 1.0 , 1.5 and 2.0 km / s , respectively , were added to the measured velocity dispersions quadratically , i.e. , @xmath114 as can be seen in the figure , a binary fraction of 20 - 40% improves the match of our models on _ orbit 3 _ with the observed velocity dispersion , which is a reasonable binary fraction for a globular cluster @xcite , whereas the models on _ orbit 1 _ and _ orbit 2 _ would prefer values of @xmath11540% in order to agree with the observational value of the velocity dispersion .",
    "this would have no effect on the discrepant slope of the surface density profile at large radii of the models on _ orbit 1 & 2 _ , though .",
    "but why do our proper motion values of _ orbit 3 _ differ so significantly from the siegel et al .",
    "first of all , as stated above , we do not argue that pal  13 has to be on this specific orbit but is most likely close to its apogalacticon .",
    "a family of proper motion values around the values we chose may reproduce the observations equally well , since we only chose those values in order to minimize pal  13 s orbital velocity within the mw such that the orbital compression effect is maximal . moreover , the observational values of siegel et al .",
    "may also be influenced by the orbital compression effect just as the other measurements .",
    "consequently , their uncertainties may be largely underestimated .    in fig .",
    "[ propermotion ] we show the original raw data from @xcite which was obtained from photographic plates separated by a 40 year baseline . after determining the zero point of each photographic plate with 140 potential cluster stars lying within the inner 6 arcmin of the cluster , they identified background galaxies which",
    "were then used to determine the cluster s proper motion .",
    "the spread and uncertainties of those 16 background galaxies are large .",
    "siegel et al .",
    "find that this is due to a colour dependence of their proper motion , which is why they apply an ad - hoc colour correction to their sample and disregard 2 galaxies for which no colour information was available .",
    "from this corrected sample they derive the resulting proper motion and the relatively small uncertainties , which are also depicted in fig .",
    "[ propermotion ] .    in the same figure",
    "we also show the proper motion as artificially measured for all stars within the inner 6 arcmin of the three clusters with @xmath116 and @xmath109 pc .",
    "the stars from the cluster on _ orbit 1 _ lie exactly on the proper motion values of siegel et al .",
    "( as expected since we used these values as input ) .",
    "accordingly , the stars from the model on _ orbit 2 _ lie concentrated at zero proper motion .",
    "only the stars of the cluster on _ orbit 3 _ show a significant intrinsic scatter of more than 0.5 mas pc@xmath117 about the central proper motion values of the cluster .",
    "this is due to extra - tidal stars which are on slightly different orbits than the cluster . even though this scatter does not suffice to explain the discrepancy it may introduce an additional systematic uncertainty . given that siegel et al .",
    "have not accounted for such a possible intrisic scatter , and given the nevertheless large scatter in their determined stellar proper motions ( see their fig .",
    "5 ) , we argue that in the curious case of pal 13 , the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the proper motion determination may indeed be ( several times ) larger than the formal error derived by siegel et al .",
    "a possible alternative would be that the galactic potential which was used in our investigation does not properly reflect the true potential of the milky way . in order to keep the proper motion determined by @xcite and move pal  13 closer to its apogalacticon",
    "we would have to modify the galactic potential such that it is significantly stronger at the distance of pal  13 , as this would mean that the cluster gets decelerated more strongly and can not get to large galactocentric distances .",
    "but the most recent measurements of the milky - way potential agree well with our choice of potential , finding circular velocities of about 220 km / s at the distance of the sun ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a possible flattening of the potential of about 0.87 @xcite .",
    "such a flattening would imply the opposite of what would be necessary for bringing pal  13 closer to its apogalacticon , since the galactic force would be less strong at a given distance from the galactic plane compared to the unflattened case .",
    "we performed a set of @xmath118 @xmath0-body computations of the low - mass milky - way globular cluster palomar 13 which shows some peculiarities in observations .",
    "first of all , @xcite measured a velocity dispersion of @xmath119 km / s , which yields a very high mass - to - light ratio of about 40 due to the cluster s low integrated absolute magnitude of only @xmath14 mag .",
    "secondly , pal  13 shows a shallow slope at large radii within its surface density profile of @xmath5 , making a determination of its tidal radius difficult @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested in both publications that these effects might be due to pal  13 s last pericentre passage on its eccentric orbit about the galactic centre .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find by means of @xmath0-body computations that pericentre passages barely influence the appearance of a cluster s surface density profile .",
    "instead , they find a flattening of the surface density profile only for clusters on eccentric orbits which are about to reach their apogalacticon , resulting from the compression of the tidal debris as it gets decelerated in its orbit .",
    "we therefore use three different orbits to explicitly test these two hypotheses for pal 13 ( fig .",
    "[ orbits ] ) .",
    "first , we use the radial velocity measured by @xcite in combination with the proper motion measured by @xcite .",
    "this yields an orbit in which pal  13 today is close to its perigalacticon ( _ orbit  1 _ ) .",
    "secondly , we use only the measured radial velocity but set the proper motion to zero .",
    "this yields a similar orbit which is less eccentric and in which pal  13 is today closer to apogalacticon but still not close enough for the effect of tidal debris compression described in @xcite , and which causes the surface density profile at large radii to become shallow , to take place ( _ orbit  2 _ ) .",
    "finally , we use the orbit with the proper motion which minimizes the orbital velocity of pal  13 , since this yields the orbit in which pal  13 is today closest to apogalacticon ( _ orbit  3 _ ) .",
    "as it turns out , the model clusters on _ orbit  3 _ can readily reproduce pal  13 s peculiarities both in terms of surface density profile and velocity dispersion ( and thus mass - to - light ratio ) , whereas the two other orbits can not ( fig .  [ results ] ) .",
    "while the first two orbits yield clusters with regular equilibrium velocity dispersion , the last orbit yields an enhanced velocity dispersions and a much larger spread in velocity dispersion values when measured from a subset of 21 stars .",
    "this is due to unbound stars within the cluster ( potential escapers ) , and extra - tidal stars which get pushed back into the vicinity of the cluster when the cluster - tail system gets decelerated on its way to apogalacticon @xcite .    with this investigation",
    "we would like to stress the importance of the orbital phase of a cluster on its appearance .",
    "particularly interesting is the orbital phase just before reaching apogalacticon , where the cluster and its tails get decelerated and thus compressed such that the stellar density , especially in the region around the cluster s tidal radius , gets enhanced with unbound stars .",
    "these stars can alter the slope of the surface density profile at large radii , and increase the measured velocity dispersion significantly .    since any cluster ( or satellite in general ) on an eccentric orbit about a galaxy spends most of its lifetime close to apogalacticon , it is likely to be observed in such a phase . it is therefore expected that a good fraction of all satellites are affected by this effect of orbital compression of their tidal debris .",
    "observations not taking this effect into account may therefore assume too large tidal radii and/or ascribe a pronounced tidal debris to tidal shocking which in reality is only due to the deceleration of the satellite - tail system . and in some cases it may even lead to drastic overestimates of the dynamical mass , as is demonstrated here for pal  13 .",
    "moreover , orbital compression of a satellite s tidal debris can produce stellar systems , not only star clusters but also dwarf galaxies , which may appear largely extended , irregular in shape and dynamically hot , and thus may be misinterpreted , for instance , as bound systems embedded in dark matter haloes .",
    "whether this effect can explain , for instance , the high mass - to - light ratios of dwarf galaxies such as segue 1 , which is currently known as the darkest ultra - faint dwarf galaxy @xcite , has to be checked in a future investigation focussing on typical dwarf galaxy orbits and morphologies .",
    "since dwarf galaxies are in general more diluted than globular clusters we expect that the effect is more pronounced in those cases .",
    "work in this direction by @xcite and @xcite indeed suggests similar issues are relevant for dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "segue 1 , in fact , has recently been found in sdss data to show a prominent tidal debris and therefore was re - classified as a dissolving star cluster @xcite .",
    "its enhanced m / l ratio was interpreted as contaminated by stars from the sagittarius stream but may well be due to the orbital compression effect described here .",
    "finally , this investigation poses the question how reliable proper motion measurement for halo satellites are ( especially if they suffer from the orbital compression effect described in this work ) , or if we understand the potential of the milky way correctly , i.e. is the @xcite potential which we used in this investigation a sufficient approximation ? if the observed peculiarities in pal  13 are indeed due to the orbital phase of the cluster , then either the proper motion measurement or the galactic potential will be in question .",

    "moreover , they are grateful to sverre aarseth for making his nbody codes accessible to the public .",
