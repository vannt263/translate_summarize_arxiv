    "we consider the cauchy problem @xmath1 for a wave equation with variable propagation speed . as usual",
    "we denote @xmath2 , @xmath3 the laplacian on @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a sufficiently regular non - negative function subject to conditions specified later on .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of the energy as @xmath6 for coefficients bearing _ very fast oscillations _ ( in the classification of reissig - yagdjian @xcite , @xcite ) , but satisfying a suitable _ stabilisation condition _ in the spirit of hirosawa @xcite , @xcite . for this",
    "we assume that the coefficient @xmath7 can be written as product @xmath8 of a shape function @xmath9 ( being essentially free of oscillations ) and a bounded perturbation @xmath10 containing a certain amount of oscillations controlled by our main assumptions .",
    "our method leads to an extension of the generalised energy conservation law from @xcite including the shape function @xmath9 . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that the adapted hyperbolic energy of the solution @xmath11 of , @xmath12 satisfies a _ two - sided _ energy inequality of the form @xmath13 with constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 depending on the data .",
    "the upper bound can be given in terms of the norms of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it is _ not _ possible to replace @xmath18 by the corresponding homogeneous space @xmath19 ( as in the case of @xcite ) .",
    "the behaviour of the energy is only of interest as @xmath6 ( or in the neighbourhood of zeros of @xmath9 , which is not within the scope of this note ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to restrict considerations to _ monotonous _ @xmath9 with @xmath20 .",
    "basic assumptions of our approach are that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , together with    ( a1 ) : :    @xmath23 , @xmath24 together with    the estimates    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denotes a    primitive of @xmath9 ; ( a2 ) : :    @xmath27 ; ( a3 ) : :    @xmath10 @xmath28-stabilises towards 1 ,    i.e. we assume that @xmath29 ( a4 ) : :    for @xmath30 the symbol type estimates    @xmath31    are valid , where @xmath32 and ( a5 ) : :    @xmath33    the number @xmath34 is determined from ( a3)(a5 ) .",
    "the conditions are similar to those from @xcite , reason for that is the close relation between wave equations with increasing propagation speed and weakly damped ones .",
    "condition ( a5 ) can be understood as defining property of @xmath35 in terms of @xmath9 , the stabilisation rate @xmath36 and the number @xmath34 .",
    "stabilisation condition ( a3 ) is only meaningful if @xmath37 . indeed",
    "if ( a4 ) and ( a5 ) hold with @xmath38 we would require @xmath39 and two - sided energy estimates follow directly by gronwall inequality .    in most examples it is useful to replace assumptions ( a4 ) and ( a5 ) by the following two slightly stronger conditions ,",
    "namely one can use a specific function @xmath35 depending on @xmath9 , the stabilisation rate @xmath36 and the number @xmath34 and assume that    ( a4 ) : :    for @xmath30 the symbol type estimates    @xmath40    are valid and ( a5 ) : :    for some number @xmath41 the estimate    @xmath42 holds true .",
    "the advantage is that these conditions are more easily checked and the benefit of the number @xmath34 can be seen directly .",

    "later on we will construct examples along the lines of these conditions and also give counter - examples in the sense that there exists a coefficient satisfying the converse to the inequality ( a4  ) for @xmath45 arbitrarily close to @xmath46 such that the mentioned uniform estimates of the energy do not hold .",

    "furthermore , @xmath86 combined with @xmath87 implies that for sufficiently large @xmath70 the matrix @xmath88 is invertible with uniformly bounded inverse , @xmath89 .",
