    "our universe as a whole can hardly be called a usual quantum system , however , if we want to apply the laws of quantum mechanics to such exiting processes as the birth of the universe and its subsequent evolution we have to treat it as a quantum object obeying some fundamental principles of the usual quantum mechanics including unitarity , and hence the normalizability of the wave function of the universe and other characteristics that only appear in the quantum level . in the usual hamiltonian formulation",
    "the wave function of the universe @xmath1 is a functional only of the metric field @xmath2 and other fields @xmath3 defined on three - space , so the relation in classical general relativity @xmath4 , known as the wheeler - dewitt ( wd ) equation , seems to indicate that theories no causality in quantum cosmology , no dynamics and no obvious analogue of a conserved probability distribution .",
    "quantum cosmology has revived a very old issue in quantum theory , i.e. the relation between wave function and probability distributions @xcite , but it is well known , that the hartle - hawking wave function is not normalizable in a semiclassical approximation@xcite , and also it does not allow a conserved current with a positive - definite probability density . a partial answer to this subject",
    "was introduced , for first time in @xcite , where a `` weight '' function is used in the definition of a positive - definite probability density @xmath5 , using the dirac quantization for frw cosmologies . here",
    "we will give other answer to this subject , using supersymmetric quantum approach n=2 , where we also introduce one `` weight '' function in the definition for the inner product of two supersymmetry states , that permits us to avoid the ordinary real parameter `` p '' that measure the ambiguity in the factor ordering ( here is fixed ! ) .",
    "other intrisic problem is selection of the appropriate boundary conditions on the wave function . to solve this problem ,",
    "some proposals have been suggested @xcite . also at the quantum level the problem of the ambiguity in the factor",
    "ordering , when the wd equation contains the product of non - commuting operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is any canonical `` coordinate '' field and @xmath7 is the canonical conjugate momentum to this `` coordinate '' . in the usual way , this ambiguity has been `` measured '' with the parameter `` p''@xcite , where p is a real constant . for some particular `` p ''",
    "values it was possible to solve the wd equation @xcite .    in this work we present an approach to solve this last problem , using the ideas of supersymmetry breaking selection rules under local n=2 conformal supersymmetry .",
    "we present a solution for the wave function of the universe for the frw cosmological model , that is normalizable , and also we obtain the behaviour of the spectation value for the scalar factor in the usual way , giving us proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of normalizable solution of the system , that appears in this approach means in its turn , that supersymmetry is unbroken quantum mechanically .    to solve this problem in our supersymmetric approach",
    "the `` coordinate '' field corresponds to the scalar factor of the universe for the frw cosmological model , when we do the integration with measure @xmath9 in the inner product of two states , thus the momenta hermitian - conjugate to @xmath10 is non - hermitian with @xmath11 .",
    "however , we can construct one hermitian operator and by means of this avoid the use of the real parameter `` p '' .",
    "this work is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we present the lagrangian , including the auxiliary fields and with them we give the supersymmetry breaking selection rules . in sec .",
    "iii we give the super - algebra , that satisfies the different operators in the theory .",
    "iv is devoted to the solution of the normalized wave function state with zero energy , besides , we present the spectation value for the scalar factor .",

    "the factor @xmath0 in the kinetic terms of the scalar factor @xmath67 plays the role of a `` metric '' tensor in the lagrangian , the kinetic energy for the scalar factor is negative definite , this is due to the fact , that the particle - like fluctuations do not correspond to the scalar factor , and the kinetic energy of the scalar fields @xmath68 is positive .",
