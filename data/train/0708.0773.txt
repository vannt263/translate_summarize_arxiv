    "[ intro ] the derivation of the nuclear force from chiral effective field theory ( eft ) has been discussed extensively in the literature since the work of weinberg @xcite .",
    "an underlying power counting allows to improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in a perturbative expansion .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive two- and corresponding three - nucleon forces as well as external current operators in a consistent way . for reviews we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "recently the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interaction has been described to a high precision using chiral eft @xcite . as of today , the strangeness @xmath3 hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction ( @xmath5 ) was not investigated extensively using eft @xcite .",
    "the strangeness @xmath6 hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath7 ) and cascade - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interactions had not been investigated using chiral eft so far . in this contribution",
    "we show the results for the recently constructed chiral eft for the @xmath0 baryon - baryon ( @xmath9 ) channels @xcite . at leading order ( lo ) in the power counting , the @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 potentials consist of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges , analogous to the @xmath2 potential of @xcite .",
    "the potentials are derived using su(3 ) constraints .",
    "we solve a coupled channels lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the lo potential and fit to the low - energy @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "furthermore results for various @xmath7 and @xmath8 cross sections are given .",
    "we have constructed the chiral potentials for the @xmath0 sectors at lo using the weinberg power counting , see @xcite .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the lo @xmath1 invariant contact terms for the octet baryon - baryon interactions that are hermitian and invariant under lorentz transformations were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the pertinent lagrangians read @xmath10 here , the labels @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the dirac indices of the particles , the label @xmath13 denotes the five elements of the clifford algebra , @xmath14 is the usual irreducible octet representation of @xmath1 ( a @xmath15-matrix ) .",
    "the clifford algebra elements are here actually diagonal @xmath16-matrices in flavor space .",
    "the brackets denote taking the trace in flavor space . in lo",
    "the lagrangians give rise to six independent low - energy coefficients ( lecs ) : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 refer to the central and spin - spin parts of the potential respectively .",
    "the contribution of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges is discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "we do not discuss it here , instead we refer the reader to e.g. @xcite .",
    "we solve the ls equation for the @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems .",
    "the potentials in the ls equation are cut off with a regulator function , @xmath25 $ ] , in order to remove high - energy components of the baryon and pseudoscalar meson fields .",
    "because of @xmath1 symmetry , only five of the lecs can be determined in a fit to the @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "a good description of the 35 low - energy @xmath4 scattering data has been obtained for cut - off values @xmath26 mev and for natural values of the lecs .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "see @xcite for more details . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the shaded band represents the results of the chiral eft in the considered cut - off region . for comparison also results for the jlich 04 meson - exchange model @xcite and the nijmegen nsc97f meson - exchange model @xcite are shown . the @xmath4 interaction based on chiral eft yields a correctly bound hypertriton , also reasonable @xmath27 separation energies for @xmath28",
    "have been predicted @xcite .",
    "the sixth lec is only present in the isospin zero @xmath6 channels .",
    "there is scarce experimental knowledge in these channels . in the @xmath29 system , we assume a moderate attraction and exclude bound states or near - threshold resonances",
    ". based on these considerations the sixth lec was varied in the range of @xmath30 times the natural value . various cross sections for @xmath31 mev",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "our findings have shown that the chiral eft scheme , successfully applied in @xcite to the @xmath2 interaction , also works well for the @xmath0 @xmath9 interactions in lo .",
    "it will be interesting to perform a combined @xmath2 and @xmath4 study in chiral eft , starting with a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
