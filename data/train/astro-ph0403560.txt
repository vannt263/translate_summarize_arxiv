    "spectroscopic observations from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have the advantage of large numbers of quasars ( qsos ) and a large redshift range that provides an unique opportunity to study their intrinsic properties , sample variation , and spectral classification in great detail . a powerful method to address these questions",
    "is the kl transform .",
    "the idea is to derive from the observed spectra a lower dimensional set of eigenspectra ( connolly et al .",
    "1995 ) , in which the essential spectral properties are represented . in the following we outline some results from applying this method to the sdss quasars .",
    "the sample we use is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) first data release ( dr1 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) quasar catalog ( schneider et al .",
    "2003 ) , consisting of 16,713 quasars .",
    "the redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41 and the k - corrected @xmath1-band absolute magnitudes ( @xmath2 ) from -30 to -22 .",
    "we divide the whole sample into several redshift and luminosity bins with @xmath3 ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we consider wavelength ranges for all bins within a restframe 900  to 8000 .",
    "the spectra are shifted to their restframes , and bad data are approximated using the gap - repairing formalism ( connolly & szalay 1999 ) .",
    "the details of the kl transform are described in , for example , connolly et al .",
    "previous work applying the kl transform on quasar spectra or observed parameters include francis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , boroson & green ( 1992 ) , and shang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in the following ,",
    "the flux densities are expressed in restframe values and the wavelengths are in vacuum .",
    "we find that the quasars can be classified into a continuous variation of the spectral slope .",
    "figure  1 shows the observed quasar spectra as a function of the first two eigencoefficients , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( in our notation the first mode is the mean spectrum ) , in the redshift range @xmath9 and the luminosity range @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the actual values of the eigencoefficients are shown on top of each sub - figure . along the sequence with decreasing @xmath8 values ,",
    "the quasar continua are progressively bluer .",
    "this implies that the linear - combination of the first 2 modes changes the spectral slope . in this regard",
    ", this is similar to the galaxy spectral classification by the kl approach ( connolly et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the first two eigenspectra in the local region around h  @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , constructed with more than 2,500 sdss qsos in the redshift range @xmath14 .",
    "an anti - correlation is seen between fe  ii ( optical ) and [ o  iii]@xmath155008 , which is also known as the `` eigenvector-1 '' ( boroson & green , 1992 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the [ o  iii]@xmath155008 luminosity is an isotropic property , as such this anti - correlation is not driven by the observed orientation of the quasar .    in the local region around ly  @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , the eigenspectra from about 1300 wavelength - selected sdss qsos show agreement with those from francis",
    "the second eigenspectrum shows low - velocity ( so - called _ line - core _ ) components of broad emission lines , and the third mode gives the continuum slope variation .",
    "we find a dependence of the coefficient from the second eigenspectrum on both redshift and luminosity ( not shown ) .",
    "the dominant redshift effect is found to be the evolution of the blended fe  ii emission lines ( optical ) and the balmer continuum ( the `` small - bump '' , @xmath0 ) , as such it is more prominent in the lower - redshift quasars and less obvious or absent in the higher - redshift ones .",
    "this result suggests that the iron abundances build up as quasar evolves , in agreement with quasars in the large , bright quasar survey ( green et al .",
    "2001 ) and in another independent study ( kuhn et al .",
    "2001 ) . on the other hand , the dominant luminosity effect in the quasar spectra is found to be the baldwin effect  the decrease of line equivalent width with luminosity , which is detected in ly  @xmath16 , si  iv+o  iv@xmath18 $ ] , c  iv , he  ii , c  iii@xmath18 $ ] and mg  ii emission lines . the effect in n  v seems to be redshift dependent , so that an opposite sign ( an _ increase _ of line equivalent width with luminosity ) is seen in the lower - redshift quasars .    in summary , we show that the quasar eigenspectra are invaluable to us in probing the intrinsic properties of quasars in a large data set .",
    "in addition to the redshift and luminosity dependent sets of eigenspectra , we also construct a single set of eigenspectra of the full dr1 catalog ranging from restframe wavelengths 900 to 8000 in order to study the correlations between the uv and the optical spectral regions .",
    "interested readers can find detail discussions in properties of these eigenspectra and future directions in yip et al .",
