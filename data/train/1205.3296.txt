    "charged clusters and small droplets are important in many areas of physical chemistry , ranging from aerosol formation in the atmosphere @xcite to electrospray processes in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the presence of charge on a droplet affects both its interactions with other species and the physical properties of the individual droplet . amongst the most important questions relating to physical properties are",
    "how much charge a cluster or droplet can accommodate without becoming unstable on short timescales , and how the break - up of the droplet proceeds as this charge limit is approached and exceeded .",
    "one area where such considerations are crucial is electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry .",
    "the electrospray technique produces a stream of charged droplets that solvate molecules or complexes to be conveyed into the mass spectrometer for analysis .",
    "before the analyte s mass - to - charge ratio is measured , it becomes separated from the solvent , and some of the droplet s charge is deposited on it .",
    "various models have been proposed to describe the mechanism by which the solvent leaves the analyte @xcite in different circumstances .",
    "computer simulations with atomistic detail have been employed to obtain a more explicit picture of the desolvation process and also to study the structure of water droplets containing ions @xcite and solvated biomolecules @xcite .    on the fundamental question of the stability of pure charged droplets , the key theoretical work dates back well over a hundred years to rayleigh @xcite , who considered arbitrary deformations of a uniformly charged , structureless spherical droplet .",
    "deformations away from a spherical shape increase the surface area of the droplet , thereby increasing its surface energy , but at the same time decrease the electrostatic repulsion by spreading the charge out . at a total charge @xmath0 known as the rayleigh limit",
    ", the electrostatic contribution to the energy overwhelms the surface energy and the droplet becomes mechanically unstable . in eq .",
    "( [ rayleigh ] ) , @xmath1 is the surface tension of the liquid , @xmath2 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath3 is the droplet diameter .",
    "rayleigh s formula remains of great practical use to the present day .    to examine the nature of charge - driven instabilities with particle - level detail ,",
    "simulations of small charged clusters have been carried out by adding coulomb interactions to simple generic potentials like lennard - jones @xcite and morse @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have mostly concentrated on total charges where the cluster is decisively in the unstable regime and rapidly undergoes fragmentation .    in this article",
    ", we take a closer look at the properties of charged clusters with an explicit but generic representation of individual particles , concentrating on the structure of clusters as the charge - driven instability is approached from below .",
    "we treat the clusters at equilibrium , setting aside the dynamical aspects of fragmentation for now .",
    "the results presented here constitute a case study on a cluster of 309 lennard - jones particles to which coulomb repulsion has been added .",
    "309 is a `` magic number '' for the lennard - jones potential ; the lowest - energy structure consists of four complete icosahedral shells around a central atom @xcite .",
    "the present study represents the preliminary steps in a more comprehensive ongoing investigation of charged droplets .",

    "we will therefore treat @xmath22 as a continuously variable effective charge .",
    "the fact that the particles constituting the cluster are represented explicitly and may each carry a charge of only @xmath22 or @xmath23 means that there is no need to consider an underlying continuum medium with its own conductivity .",
    "the charge distribution is completely determined by the function @xmath24 and a small number of external parameters , such as the temperature .",
    "therefore , although our model is coarse - grained , its particulate nature makes it more physically detailed than a continuum model .",
    "we simulate the cluster at thermodynamic equilibrium using canonical monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "in addition to standard displacements of individual particles , we employ trial moves that attempt to swap the charges on randomly chosen charged ",
    "uncharged pairs of particles while keeping all positions fixed .",
    "these steps are accepted according to the usual metropolis criterion @xcite .",
    "the swap moves are not intended to mimic the dynamical process of charge transfer or conductivity that may occur between molecules in certain systems . in particular , the swaps are not restricted to pairs of adjacent particles . the purpose of the moves is to enhance the efficiency with which the equilibrium distribution of charges is reached and sampled , and the moves achieve this by , in effect , decoupling the mobility of the charge from the movement of individual particles .",
    "the same distribution would eventually be achieved by any set of mc moves that obey ( detailed ) balance .",
    "we will be concerned with the behaviour of the cluster as a function of the magnitude of the single - particle charge @xmath22 for a given @xmath16 and , to some extent , on the properties with a given charge as a function of temperature @xmath25 . to accelerate sampling in these cases ,",
    "we have employed replica - exchange mc @xcite , using either the temperature @xcite or the charge as the parameter that varies between replicas . in the latter case ,",

    "any cluster is thermodynamically unstable with respect to vaporisation unless it is confined .",
    "we therefore constrain the cluster to lie within a spherical container of radius @xmath33 whose centre follows the centre - of - mass of the cluster @xcite .",
    "this radius is large enough not to inhibit large fluctuations in the shape of the cluster and also allows fragmentation to occur .",
    "we shall return to the consequences of this particular choice of radius when discussing the results .",
    "we will consider the effect of adding charge to the lennard - jones cluster at reduced temperatures @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ cv ] shows the canonical constant - volume heat capacity @xmath36 of the cluster , derived from temperature replica - exchange simulations coupled with multiple histogram reweighting @xcite .",
    "the taller of the two peaks is due to the main melting transition @xcite , meaning that our two temperatures correspond to well within the solid - like state and just within the liquid - like regime , respectively",
    ".     cluster , obtained by the multiple histogram method .",
    "[ cv],width=283 ]    at @xmath37 , the neutral cluster fluctuates uneventfully about its icosahedral global minimum @xcite .",
    "this qualitative behaviour persists if some charge is added , but for sufficiently large charge , a small number of charged particles are expelled , leaving a well - defined sub - cluster at the centre of the spherical container .",
    "the expelled particles typically lie close to the container edge , repelled there by the long range coulomb potential .",
    "we may therefore count an individual configuration as dissociated if at least one charged particle lies within a small distance , chosen to be @xmath38 , from the container wall . the line marked with circles in fig .",
    "[ dissoc ] shows that the equilibrium fraction of dissociated configurations at equilibrium rises sharply at a particular value of the single - particle charge , indicating that electrostatic repulsion has become strong enough to overcome the cohesive part of the lennard - jones potential .",
    "we will designate the total charge at which the fraction of dissociated configurations passes through @xmath39 by @xmath40 ; beyond this threshold , more than half the equilibrium configurations are dissociated .     with @xmath41 charged particles at temperatures @xmath37 ( black circles ) and @xmath35 ( red squares ) as a function of the charge per particle .",
    "[ dissoc ] , width=283 ]    at the liquid - like temperature @xmath42 , a similar pattern is observed , as shown by the squares in fig .",
    "[ dissoc ] . however , since the cluster has now escaped the basin of attraction of its icosahedral global minimum and explores a range of disordered structures , the transition from an intact cluster to full dissociation is a broader function of the charge .",
    "we will nevertheless use the same criterion of @xmath40 to quantify the maximum charge that the cluster can sustain .",
    "importantly , @xmath40 is a function of @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _  the maximum total charge that the cluster can sustain depends on the number of particles over which the charge is spread",
    ". figure [ maxcharge ] shows that @xmath40 increases quite dramatically with @xmath16 , especially at the lower temperature .",
    "it is not straightforward to compare the @xmath43 of eq .",
    "( [ rayleigh ] ) with @xmath40 , not least because we must work at temperatures well below the triple point of @xmath44 @xcite , where the bulk surface tension is not known . however , we note that the influence of @xmath16 discrete charges does not enter into rayleigh s analysis because in that analysis the droplet is treated as being homogeneously charged .",
    "the dependence of the maximum charge on @xmath16 is potentially important in the context of small electrospray droplets , where the charge of the droplet may be due to a relatively small number of ions .",
    "our thermodynamically based @xmath40 suggests that such droplets have a greater tendency to dissociate by the emission of charged particles than a hypothetical cluster where the same amount of charge is spread out over a larger number of particles .     that the cluster can sustain at @xmath37 ( black circles ) and @xmath42 ( red squares ) as a function of the number of particles @xmath16 over which the charge is spread .",
    "[ maxcharge ] , width=283 ]    increasing the container radius @xmath45 decreases the value of @xmath40 that is obtained because dissociated charged particles can then go further from the remaining sub - cluster , thereby lowering the potential energy of the configuration and raising its statistical weight relative to the undissociated cluster",
    ". however , the decisive trend of increasing @xmath40 with @xmath16 persists for all @xmath45 large enough to permit dissociation .",
    "if the charge is increased beyond @xmath40 , a further structural change may result .",
    "it is possible for the cluster to split into two or more large sections , which then repel each other as far as the container will allow .",
    "this subdivision does not happen if @xmath16 is sufficiently small since the electrostatic energy can then be lowered by the emission of individual particles without sacrificing the attractive lennard - jones interactions in the main part of the cluster",
    ". however , as @xmath16 increases , subdivision occurs at a threshold increasingly close to @xmath40 and , for large container radius , may even preempt significant loss of individual charged particles .",
    "this observation again points to the importance of taking into account not only the total charge borne by a cluster but also the number of particles over which the charge is divided .",
    "one may anticipate that a dynamic study would find increased competition between different instability mechanisms at higher @xmath16 .",
    "an important question concerning charged droplets is where the charged particles reside . in the case of ions dissolved in water ,",
    "highly specific effects come into play in determining the affinity of ions for the surface of the bulk liquid itself , according to how a given ion influences the interactions between the water molecules @xcite . in a droplet and in the absence of strong surface affinity effects",
    ", one might expect ions to be mutually repelled to the droplet surface by electrostatic considerations .",
    "however , this is not always found to be the case @xcite .",
    "our model is more straightforward and generic than water , allowing us to consider the structure of charged droplets without the rather special effects of hydrogen bonding .",
    "energetically , the driving forces in our model are towards the optimisation of as many lennard - jones pairwise neighbours as possible and toward the maximisation of distance between like charges .",
    "the global potential energy minimum structure of the cluster , obtained using the basin hopping algorithm @xcite is always a slightly relaxed version of the neutral icosahedron @xcite . as @xmath16",
    "is increased from small values , the charged particles preferentially occupy vertices , then edges and finally faces of the outer shell before populating the cluster s interior . counteracting these energetic tendencies at finite temperature",
    "is the entropy of permuting charged and neutral particles .    to determine how the charges are divided between the surface and the interior of the cluster , we need a method for identifying surface particles . at solid - like temperatures , where the cluster retains a clear structure of concentric shells , the outermost shell of 162 particles",
    "can unambiguously be designated as the surface . for liquid - like structures ,",
    "the surface is less clear - cut and its curvature adds to the difficulty of devising a simple algorithm to detect the outermost layer .",
    "existing methods to tackle this problem include the cone algorithm of dellago and coworkers @xcite , which identifies surface particles as those for which the vertex of a cone with a particular aperture can be placed at the particle s centre without any other particles falling inside the cone .",
    "the cone may have any orientation , thereby taking into account the fact that the surface normal of a droplet may locally deviate significantly from the vector joining that region to the droplet s centre .",
    "we have devised a somewhat more straightforward algorithm that shares the advantageous features of the cone algorithm and produces a reliable and intuitively realistic division between surface and core particles .",
    "the method borrows an idea from algorithms used to determine the surface of proteins @xcite .",
    "the principle is that a particle should be regarded as lying on the surface if it would be accessible by a fictitious probe particle approaching from a distance , while the cluster configuration is held fixed . to determine this accessibility ,",
    "a nominal hard - sphere diameter @xmath46 is assigned to the lennard - jones particles .",
    "we then attempt to place a probe particle of diameter @xmath47 in contact with any combination of three particles that are sufficiently close for three contacts to be achieved simultaneously .",
    "for each such triplet , there are two possible positions for the probe particle , located symmetrically on either side of the plane defined by the triplet on the line passing through the circumcentre of the triangle",
    ". if the probe particle in at least one of these positions does not overlap with any other particle in the cluster then all three lennard - jones particles are designated as lying on the surface .",
    "a given particle may qualify as being on the surface by being tested in conjunction with any two of its neighbours .",
    "although a systematic test over all triplets of particles may seem computationally expensive , it is quite easy to omit needless iterations of the outer loops , and neighbour lists @xcite could be implemented for efficiency in larger systems if necessary .",
    "the only parameters to fix in this probe method are the nominal diameters @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". both should be comparable with @xmath7 and the results should not be sensitive to the values chosen .",
    "we have found that choosing a slightly smaller probe diameter enables the algorithm to cope better with crevices in the surface and adopted @xmath48 , @xmath49 in this study .",
    "the probe method and an example of its outcome are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ surface ] .     , width=226 ]     , width=226 ]    figure [ occupancy ] shows how the average number of charged particles occupying surface sites varies with the magnitude of the charge for several values of @xmath16 at @xmath42 . due to the liquid - like structure",
    ", the number of surface sites fluctuates and the sites have to be identified for each sample separately .",
    "the charge on the horizontal axis of the plot has been scaled by the maximum charge that the cluster can sustain for each value of @xmath16 respectively ( fig .  [ maxcharge ] ) .",
    "looking at the vertical line @xmath50 shows that it is only for very small numbers of charges and only when the charge approaches the limit of stability of the droplet that one finds most of the charged particles on the surface of the cluster .",
    "hence , for a cluster of this size bound by the generic lennard - jones potential , the charge required to drive the majority of particles electrostatically to the cluster surface is already too much for the cluster itself to remain intact .",
    "therefore , even in a model without specific surface affinity effects or polarisability , charged particles may be found predominantly in the interior of the cluster .     of charged particles at temperature @xmath42 .",
    "for each value of @xmath16 , the charge axis has been scaled by the maximum charge from fig .",

    "[ occupancy ] .",
    "however , for higher @xmath16 , although some charged particles are expelled , the higher charge still leads to an overall increase in the proportion of charges driven to the surface of the remaining sub - cluster , and the upward trend continues beyond @xmath40 .    in our simple model , the occupation of surface sites by charged particles",
    "is determined by a competition between electrostatic repulsion of charges to the surface and the entropy of mixing of charged and uncharged particles . for solid - like temperatures",
    ", the balance between these effects can be calculated quite accurately with little effort by using a few approximations . at these low temperatures ,",
    "let us neglect the effect of thermal fluctuations on the positions of the particles and consider the structure to be the perfect icosahedron of the neutral cluster s global potential energy minimum , which has @xmath53 surface particles . if @xmath16 of the @xmath4 particles are charged , the number of ways of permuting @xmath54 of them amongst the surface sites and the remaining @xmath55 amongst the @xmath56 core sites is @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] is a binomial coefficient .",

    "( [ surfprob ] ) begins to overestimate the number of charged particles at the surface , but the peak position is only in error by a few per cent , even for @xmath66 and a total charge approaching @xmath40 .",
    "given that @xmath67 is a crude average and that thermal motion and charge - induced distortion of the cluster are neglected in eq .",
    "( [ surfprob ] ) , the simple and fast prediction works well .",
    "importantly , we may conclude that the opposing driving forces of electrostatic repulsion and the permutational entropy capture most of the effects that determine the location of the charges in this model at low temperatures .    in principle",
    ", a similar approach could be taken to the liquid - like state .",
    "however , the number of surface sites is then no longer fixed and it may be necessary to sample a selection of disordered structures .",
    "furthermore , we may anticipate that the presence of charge will have a greater influence in distorting the cluster from its neutral shape than it does in the solid - like regime .",
    "we are currently investigating the influence of these effects .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that in some systems there may be more sophisticated mechanisms that affect the equilibrium distribution of charges .",
    "for example , the surface of liquid water may develop a slight excess charge even without dissolved ions due to the asymmetry of hydrogen bonds , which results in a small transfer of charge between molecules @xcite .",
    "a related effect can lead to some of the charge of a solvated ion appearing near the water surface via a chain of partial charge transfers through oriented water molecules @xcite .",
    "hence , some of the _ charge _ may appear at the surface even though the _ ions _ are located within the bulk liquid .",
    "our simple lennard - jones model does not attempt to capture the structure of water or the rather specific effects associated with hydrogen bonding .",
    "however , the model could be modified to incorporate some degree of charge separation within individual particles by adding a polarisability term to the potential .",
    "self - consistent solution of the polarisability equations to obtain the induced dipole moments adds a considerable computational overhead to the simulations . some preliminary calculations of this sort",

    "we have taken a thermodynamic approach to the stability and structure of the 309-particle lennard - jones cluster bearing charge on some of the particles . by confining the cluster to a spherical container",
    "we have calculated the equilibrium between intact and dissociated configurations and have obtained statistics for the occupation of surface sites by charged particles .",
    "the key observation from this work is that both the stability of the cluster and the extent to which charges are likely to be found at its surface depend not just on the total charge but also on the number of particles over which the charge is distributed .",
    "when the charge is spread over more particles , the cluster is able to sustain a greater total charge but the fraction of the charges that reside at surface sites is lower . in general , the cluster is prone to break up at charges lower than those required to drive all the charged particles to the surface .",
    "the location of charged particles in a sphere became an important topic following the introduction of the `` plum pudding '' model of the atom by thomson in 1904 @xcite .",
    "since then , the `` thomson problem '' has come to refer to finding the energetically optimal distribution of point charges constrained to the surface of a sphere .",
    "this idealised model has received considerable attention as an interesting exercise in global optimisation @xcite .",
    "although our charged lennard - jones cluster seems to share some common features with the thomson problem , we note that the charged particles would only be free to move continuously on the cluster surface when the cluster has melted , since at low temperatures the charges would be constrained to lie at the sites of the icosahedral structure .",
    "however , at liquid - like temperatures we have seen that the charges do not all reside at the surface of the sphere and that entropy plays a large role in determining their distribution .",
    "this means that it is not easy to make contact with the thomson problem in this context .",
    "returning to the original motivation of a better understanding of electrospray ionisation , it will now be essential to move to a dynamical treatment of cluster instability and the mechanisms of fragmentation .",
    "an unconfined cluster undergoes evaporation even of neutral particles , which would have the effect of concentrating charge within a shrinking cluster .",
