    "in particular , it was found that the dissipative star - disk interactions can significantly increase the rate of accretion of stars onto smbh as stars transfer portion of the energy to gas and their orbits are stacked in the plane of accretion disk , and as a result they also accreting onto the central black hole ( ( * ? ?",

    "however , to assess the impact of the accretion disk in the orbital and phase characteristics of the stars , one needs to explore a more realistic model of the disk .",
    "the investigated agn model includes three subsystems : a compact star cluster ( csc ) , the accretion disk ( ad ) , and the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "a star cluster is simulated by direct integration of the individual stars interaction with each other ( direct n - body simulations ) and with a gas disk and black hole .",
    "gaseous accretion disk is defined phenomenologically with density distribution constant in time , and has a keplerian rotation curve .",
    "black hole is also defined phenomenologically as a newtonian potential .",
    "if the particle comes inside the region whith radius less than @xmath0 ( radius of accretion ) , then we consider that it is accreted onto the supermassive black hole .",

    "the disk has keplerian rotation in the potential of smbh neglecting the gravitational influence of the disk and pressure gradients within the disk ( ( * ? ?",

    "to ensure that the new model of disk does not change the global dynamics of the system and thereby does not contradict the results we obtained earlier , we compared the black hole mass growth rate due to the accretion of stars ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 the evolution of the black hole during two relaxation times for both accretion disk models is identical . at the same graph control run without gaseous disk is shown . in this case ,",
    "the black hole mass growth is due to only the capture of those stars , which accidentally happened to be within the accretion radius .",
    "we also investigate the impact of accretion disk on the dynamical characteristics of stellar cluster .",
    "in particular , we analysed orbital parameters of accreted particles .",
    "we found that these two disk models give different results in orbital parameters distribution of captured particles .",
    "specifically , the new disk model allows stars to survive in the accretion disk for longer times than in old disk model .",
    "so we get much more particles accreted in near - circular orbits ( @xmath23 ) in the disk plane ( @xmath24 ) . although both disk models initiate the same growth rate of the central smbh ( fig.[fig1 ] )",
    ", the gaseous disk with a constant thickness captures more counter - rotating stars , in contrast to the disk with a variable thickness .",
    "if we decrease the accretion radius value in the previous model of the disk , the gas density increases in the central part , but its thickness remains constant and it rotates around the center on keplerian orbits . this leads to deceleration of many stars on orbits counter - rotating with the disk in the inner part of the system , including stars in nearly perpendicular orbits to the disk plane . in case of an improved disk model ,",
    "super - dense gas occurs practically only in the equatorial plane near the central black hole , and that allows many stars in the central part to evolve towards the direction of rotation of the disk .",
    "stars evolved in the positive direction of rotation relatively to the direction of the disk rotation could increase the contribution of the positive z - component of the angular momentum in the central part of the cluster .",
    "we found that the disk model with varying thickness leads to formation of relatively stable disk from stars in the inner part of the system .",
    "it captures stars which are going to be accreted and allows them to live longer in the disk .",
    "one can see formation of such disk in ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the central star cluster changes its structure in the inner part and forms stellar disk in the early stage of simulation ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this structure of star cluster retained during two relaxation times ( up to the end of the simulations ) .",
    "thus , we see that the resulting phenomenological model of gas accretion disk is physically adequate and the studied density profile can be used in the future , including modeling of the gas disk directly using the methods of hydrodynamics . in the future",
    ", we plan to improve the numerical model of agns in order to allow additional processes ( collisions of stars in the central part , stellar evolution , primordial binaries , binary black holes , etc . ) , and to perform one - to - one simulations , i.e. with the number of stars equal to that in real clusters ( about one million stars ) .",
