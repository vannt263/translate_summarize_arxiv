    "pattern recognition and in particular , image recognition techniques have been widely studied in machine learning and image processing @xcite .",
    "hardware demonstration of computation units for pattern recognition ; however , has consistently been a challenging problem in terms of chip size , power consumption , computation complexity and decision speed .    among different solid state technologies ,",
    "cmos provides the chance of low cost , highly - integrated low power implementation for pattern recognition @xcite and processing @xcite systems . for boolean logic systems ,",
    "cmos gates exhibit processing speeds up to a few ghz and can be designed to have a low static power . however , the dynamic power consumption of a large system with a ghz clock frequency can still limit the scalability .",
    "fan - in and fan - out considerations for cmos devices also impact the speed , power consumption and the size of devices . besides boolean systems",
    ", some novel non - boolean techniques have been developed to overcome these issues . in non - boolean systems , logic gates will no longer be the key block and analog / mixed signal circuits are used . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a technique for non - boolean training and detection of image pixels using a network of coupled oscillators .",
    "this structure has the capability to detect any scaled or rotated version of a desired image . on the other hand",
    ", this method suffers from high computational complexity , large area and high power consumption which limit the application for large image arrays . to this",
    ", we should also add the long convergence time .",
    "other proposed cmos systems have demonstrated artificial neural networks ( ann ) by designing circuits emulating neurons and synapses @xcite . in these systems , the larger computation burden , leaves the search open for new solutions .    to overcome the limitations of cmos devices ,",
    "other technologies are being investigated for pattern recognition applications .",
    "spintronic devices , in particular , have received a lot of attention recently because of some unique properties , e.g. , low voltage operation and non - volatility . in @xcite ,",
    "a non - volatile logic - in - memory full adder is fabricated using the magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj s ) .",
    "the proposed architecture is compared with an 0.18@xmath0 m cmos process counterpart and exhibits major advantages .",
    "the dynamic power consumption compared to a conventional cmos circuit is 23@xmath1 reduced due to reduction in the number of paths from @xmath2 to gnd . on the other hand",
    "the static power consumption is eliminated due to the non - volatility and the chip area is also reduced .",
    "as stated in @xcite , the asl devices are also non - volatile and the conputational state is preserved when the power to the circuit is turned off . in @xcite , a spin - based artificial neural network ( ann )",
    "is proposed using lateral spin valves to achieve a low power consumption and a low operatoinal voltage . in @xcite ,",
    "spin swithces to develop compact neurons and synapses are proposed . in @xcite , all - spin logic ( asl ) and charge - spin logic ( csl ) devices",
    "are shown to be capable of boolean and non - boolean operations which make them an attractive choice to build some fundamental blocks such as ring oscillators .",
    "recently , the design of asl gates with graphene channels have been proposed @xcite . due to the unique features of graphene in terms of the spin transport",
    ", the design of boolean and non - boolean computation units with these new devices can be investigated as a future direction .",
    "moreover , majority gate operation of asl devices has been previously introduced in some boolean logic systems @xcite .",
    "this unique feature of these devices can overcome fan - in and fan - out limitations of large integrated systems . besides , the inverting and non - inverting operation modes of asl devices can be the key to design many logic circuits e.g. , full adder circuits and multipliers @xcite .",
    "the time domain transient behavior of magnetization in these devices can also provide another degree of freedom to demonstrate non - boolean operations as it will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "these features , enable us to design an all - spin logic non - boolean compact structure with low power consumption and low computational complexity .    in this paper we propose a novel pattern recognition circuit that takes advantage of most novel features of spintronic devices such as non - volatility , efficient implementation of majority gates and xor functions and the ability to distinguish strong and weak majorities .",
    "non - volatility of the devices enables storing large sets of training images within the logic with no standby power dissipation .",
    "this feature also enables ` instant - on ' operation and saves on energy and delay penalties imposed by loading training images form a main memory .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the operation of asl devices .",
    "the proposed approach and the basic of computation are given in section iii .",
    "in section iv , the proposed architecture and a comprehensive discussion on design considerations are presented .",
    "simulation results and summary are shown in sections v and vi , respectively .",
    "spin of electron is introduced as a new state variable in spintronic devices to process and store information . this new alternative to charge - based systems ,",
    "provides the possibility of achieving an ultra - low voltage operation and easier demonstration of digital systems coming from the bistable nature of spin @xcite .    in all - spin logic devices , input and output data",
    "are represented by the magnetization of two ferromagnets @xcite which are communicating through a spin - coherent metallic channel .",
    "the physical view of these devices is shown in fig 1(a ) .",
    "as shown in the fig .",
    "1(b - d ) and discussed in @xcite , the applied voltage on the input ferromagnet , creates a flow of electrons which moves them from the supply voltage to the ground .",
    "this flow of electrons , becomes spin - polarized when passing through the input ferromagnet .",
    "since the concentration of the spin - polarized electrons are different at the input side and the output side of the channel , the electrons diffuse to the output side .",
    "the accumulated spin - polarized electrons under the output ferromagnet , can switch the magnetization orientation of the magnet by applying a torque based on spin - transfer torque effect .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     here , we verify ( 7 ) for the first row of table ii .",
    "using the same method for the other 3 rows , the proposition can be completely proved .",
    "+ if @xmath3 , fewer than @xmath4 of @xmath5 s are 1 .",
    "given @xmath6 , this means that fewer than @xmath4 of @xmath7 s are 1 and the rest are zero , i.e. , @xmath8    similar to ( 8) , by applying the nearest integer function , @xmath9",
