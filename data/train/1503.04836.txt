    "the schottky barrier obtained from the fit to the average spectra has been shown to be the representative barrier height of the sample , but clearly does not capture the complicated nature of the electrostatics that is present at the interface .",

    "although the majority of spectra fit to a gaussian distribution centered around the mean schottky barrier height ( 0.76  ev ) , there are locations at the interface with higher barrier heights ( @xmath19  0.9  ev ) , several standard deviations above the mean .",

    "[ n - maps](a )",
    ". a locally higher barrier height can arise due to a change in the interface , such as a defect , or the presence of a foreign material at the interface such as a oxide cluster .",
    "in addition , a physical defect that increases the elastic scattering can also give rise to a locally higher barrier due to the narrow acceptance cone of parallel momentum states just above the barrier .    a dramatic change",
    "is observed in measured electrostatics of the interface when the measurements are taken over the course of 21 days .",
    "the marked decrease in the percentage of spectra that can be fit to a schottky barrier height indicates that structure of the interface is changing .",
    "the decrease in the schottky barrier height for the 21 day sample is caused by averaging numerous spectra with little or no signal increasing the noise and making it difficult for the fitting routine to obtain a good fit as evidenced in the lower @xmath20 value . to reduce the amount of noise in the spectra for the 21 day sample an average spectra was created only from the spectra that had fits with an @xmath13 value above 0.95 , which resulted in a higher barrier height of 0.68  ev , closer to the as - deposited sample .",
    "the amount of subthreshold current in this spectra is also reduced .",
    "this selective averaging method can be utilized as a powerful noise reduction method for future beem studies and maybe useful for future beem studies where there is a low amount of transmission current .",
    "the formation of the interfacial silicide was not accelerated by sample annealing as the sample was left at room temperature under uhv conditions over the 21 day period of study . upon metal deposition",
    "the interface is comprised of tungsten and silicon , with a 1.4  nm region of uniformly intermixed tungsten and silicon as seen in the results displayed in fig .  [ metrology](b ) .",
    "this initial intermixing is accelerated due to the unintentional heating during the deposition process .",
    "after 21 days the interface is dramatically different , with a much less uniform intermixed region of tungsten and silicon that is approximately 3.8  nm thick .",
    "the small oxygen peak at the interface is attributed to the sample fabrication process , as the sample was not exposed to oxygen during beem measurements . at no point during testing was gold present at the interface .",
    "the 118  mev increase in the standard deviation and drastic reduction in spectra fit over the 21 days is attributed to these observed changes in the tungsten silicon interface .",
    "the attenuation of the ballistic electrons increases as the intermixed region increases in both thickness and disorder .",
    "this will result in numerous spectra with little or no current and hence , no detectible schottky barrier .",
    "the amount of transmission in the initial sample was only 0.015@xmath0 at a tip bias of 1.5  v bias , so a small change to the interface and it s thickness can induce drastic changes to the spectra .",
