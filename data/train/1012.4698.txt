    "morita theory is a classical topic on ring theory having a more analytic cousin called strong morita theory in the context of @xmath1-algebras .",
    "the underlying idea is that one wants to learn something about the categories of modules over a given ring by comparing it with the corresponding category for some other ring : even if the category of left modules might be a very complicated object , it can still be possible to state that for two ( non - isomorphic ) rings the corresponding categories are equivalent . in the realm of unital rings",
    "this is precisely morita equivalence . in the @xmath1-algebraic framework one",
    "is interested not just in modules but in @xmath0-representations on hilbert spaces or , more generally , on hilbert modules over some auxiliary @xmath1-algebra .    in deformation",
    "quantization one is interested in the representation theories of the deformed algebras .",
    "but now the star product algebras are more specific than `` just a ring '' and hence a purely ring - theoretic treatment would not seem to be appropriate .",
    "it simply will not capture all interesting properties of the star products .",
    "one can achieve hermitian star products yielding @xmath0-algebras and using the ring ordering of @xmath2 $ ] one has a natural notion of positivity at hand .",
    "thus from this and many other aspects the star product algebras behave much more like @xmath1-algebras .",
    "hence one requires a more refined notion of representation theory leading to @xmath0-representations on pre hilbert spaces over @xmath3 $ ] as well as on pre hilbert modules over auxiliary @xmath0-algebras over @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "it turns out that one can transfer the notions of strong morita theory from the @xmath1-algebraic theory into this entirely algebraic framework , thereby extending the previous notions tremendously .",
    "this way , star product algebras and @xmath1-algebras can be treated almost on the same footing even though the star product algebras are not at all @xmath1-algebras .    in this review , we will focus on the recent developments in the understanding of the morita theory of deformed algebras in general and of the star product algebras as major class of examples .",
    "since recently in @xcite the final classification of morita equivalent star products in the general case of poisson manifolds was obtained , it seems to be a good point to give such an overview .    in section  [ sec : moritaequivalence ] , we start with some elementary presentation of the ring - theoretic aspects of morita theory as it can be found in any algebra textbook , see e.g. @xcite",
    ". then we pass to the notion of @xmath0-morita equivalence as it was developed by ara @xcite and to the notion of strong morita equivalence which was first established by rieffel for @xmath1-algebras in @xcite and then for general @xmath0-algebras over ordered rings in @xcite . here",
    "we stress the functorial aspects of morita theory and discuss in particular the functoriality of the classical limit .",
    "section  [ sec : deformationquantization ] contains a brief introduction to the existence and classification results in deformation theory based on kontsevich s formality theorem@xcite .",
    "our focus is on the notions of equivalence of star products and of formal poisson structures . in section  [ sec : moritaequivalencestarproducts ]",
    "we explain the main result of @xcite by first establishing the gauge action of formal series of closed two - forms on formal poisson structures . on the level of equivalence classes",
    "this provides precisely the description of morita equivalent star products in terms of classical data _ provided _ the two - form is integral .",
    "the particular case of symplectic star products is easier and was discussed earlier in @xcite . in section  [ sec : incorporatingsymmetries ] we recall the basic notions of morita theory in presence of symmetries which will be modelled by a hopf algebra action . here",
    "the equivalence bimodules are required to carry an action of the hopf algebra , too , such that all structure maps have nice covariance properties .",
    "one can now study the relations between the various notions of morita equivalence . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : gactionssymplecticmanifolds ] we outline the main results of @xcite where the classification of invariant star products on a symplectic manifold up to covariant morita equivalence with respect to a lie algebra action was obtained .",
    "* acknowledgement : * it is a great pleasure to thank the organisers of the poisson 2010 conference in rio de janeiro , and in particular henrique bursztyn , for the wonderful conference .",
    "moreover , i would like to thank the participants for various suggestions and comments on my talk .",
    "in this section we first recall some basic notions of ring - theoretic morita equivalence and specialize this to @xmath0-algebras over ordered rings to establish the notions of @xmath0-morita equivalence and strong morita equivalence .",
    "we consider unital algebras over some fixed commutative unital ring @xmath4 .",
    "later on , in deformation quantization the cases @xmath5 or @xmath3 $ ] will be used .",
    "one can abandon the condition of having unital algebras by imposing some slightly weaker requirements ( non - degeneracy and idempotency ) but we do not need this more general framework here .    the idea of morita theory is to replace ordinary algebra homomorphisms @xmath6 by something more general in order to have more freedom when comparing algebras .",
    "the new arrows between algebras will now be _ bimodules_. consider a @xmath7-bimodule @xmath8 : this notation says that @xmath9 acts from the left while @xmath10 acts from the right . by convention",
    ", all bimodules will have a compatible @xmath4-module structure and all structure maps will be @xmath4-(multi-)linear in the following . moreover , the units of @xmath10 and @xmath9 will act as identity on @xmath8 .",
    "we will view @xmath8 now as an arrow from @xmath10 to @xmath9 . if @xmath11 is another bimodule for some additional algebra @xmath12 then the composition of bimodules will be the tensor product over the algebra in the middle , i.e. @xmath13      \\morphism(800,0)|b|/{@{<-}@/^2em/}/<800,0>[\\mathcal{b}`\\mathcal{a}.;{{\\sideset{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{b}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{a}}}}{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{e } } } } } ]      \\morphism(0,0)|b|/{@{<-}@/_2em/}/<1600,0>[\\mathcal{c}`\\mathcal{a}.;{{\\sideset{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{c}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{b}}}}{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{f}}}}}\\otimes_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathcal{b}}{{\\sideset{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{b}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{a}}}}{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{e } } } } } ]      \\efig\\ ] ] as a unit morphism one uses the canonical bimodule @xmath14 where @xmath10 acts on itself by left and right multiplications .",
    "now @xmath15 is not directly associative but only associative up to a natural isomorphism . also , @xmath14 is not directly a unit element for @xmath15 but again only up to a natural isomorphism .",
    "thus we have to identify isomorphism classes of bimodules : this results in an honest category which we denote by @xmath16 . strictly speaking",
    ", we should confine ourselves to bimodules and algebras from some grothendieck universe in order to get honest sets of morphisms .",
    "but this is a technical issue which will not affect the notion of morita equivalence at all .",
    "while passing to isomorphism classes of bimodules has the advantage to yield a category we can also stay with the bimodules directly and taking into account that @xmath15 is not really associative .",
    "this leads to a _",
    "bicategory _ where the @xmath17-morphisms are the bimodules and the @xmath18-morphisms , i.e. the morphisms between the @xmath17-morphisms , are the bimodule homomorphisms .",
    "such @xmath18-morphisms can then be depicted by @xmath19      \\morphism(0,0)|b|/{@{<-}@/_2em/}/<800,0>[\\mathcal{b}`\\mathcal{a};{{\\sideset{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{b}}}}{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\prime}}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{a}}}}{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{e } } } } } ]      \\morphism(400,150)|b|/=>/<0,-300>[`;\\phi ]      \\efig\\ ] ] for a bimodule homomorphism @xmath20 .",
    "note that we require @xmath21 to be @xmath4-linear as well .",
    "it is then a classical result that the natural isomorphisms implementing the associativity for @xmath15 and the unit properties of @xmath14 satisfy the necessary coherence properties to yield a bicategory ( weak @xmath18-category ) , see @xcite .",
    "this bicategory will then be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "we are now in the position to state the definition of morita equivalence :    [ definition : moritaequivalence ] two unital @xmath4-algebras @xmath10 and @xmath9 are morita equivalent if they are isomorphic in @xmath16 .",
    "a bimodule @xmath8 representing an invertible arrow in @xmath16 is called an equivalence bimodule .",
    "the groupoid of invertible arrows in @xmath16 is called the picard groupoid , denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the isotropy group of it at @xmath10 is called the picard group @xmath24 of @xmath10 .    alternatively",
    ", we can also use isomorphisms in @xmath22 in the sense of bicategories , i.e. two objects @xmath10 and @xmath9 are isomorphic if there are @xmath17-morphisms in both directions such that their compositions are isomorphic ( via @xmath18-morphisms ) to the identity morphisms @xmath14 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "this gives then the _ picard bigroupoid _",
    "@xmath26 as well as the _ picard bigroup _",
    "@xmath27 at @xmath10 .",
    "the main task of morita theory is then twofold : first one would like to know which algebras are morita equivalent , this is described by the _ orbits _ of the picard groupoid .",
    "second , one would like to understand in how many different ways two algebras can be morita equivalent . thanks to the groupoid structure this is equivalent to determine the isotropy groups , i.e. the picard groups : they encode how many self - equivalences an algebra has .",
    "the classical theorem of morita determines now the structure of equivalence bimodules :    [ theorem : morita ] @xmath8 is an equivalence bimodule for two unital @xmath4-algebras @xmath10 and @xmath9 iff there is an idempotent @xmath28 in some matrix algebra over @xmath10 such that the right @xmath10-module @xmath29 is isomorphic to @xmath30 and one has @xmath31 as well as @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 denotes the two - sided ideal generated by the @xmath34 components of @xmath35 and the isomorphism in the last statement are those induced by the action of @xmath9 and @xmath36 on @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , an equivalence bimodule @xmath8 is a finitely generated and projective module over @xmath10 .",
    "this shows already that we have to look for equivalence bimodules inside the @xmath38-theory of @xmath10 .",
    "since morita equivalence is a symmetric relation by the very definition , we can equivalently formulate things in terms of @xmath9 instead .",
    "[ example : serreswan ] as a first example relevant for the following we consider the smooth complex - valued functions @xmath39 for a smooth manifold @xmath40 .",
    "then it is well - known that any finitely generated projective module over @xmath41 is isomorphic as a right module to the sections @xmath42 of a complex vector bundle @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , this gives an equivalence bimodule with @xmath44 iff the fiber dimension of @xmath45 is not zero .",
    "thus the morita equivalent algebras to @xmath41 are isomorphic to the sections @xmath46 of the endomorphism bundle @xmath47 for arbitrary non - zero vector bundles @xmath43 .",
    "this example also allows to determine the picard group of @xmath41 : since the only way to get the endomorphism algebra @xmath46 to be isomorphic to @xmath41 is by a _ line bundle _ @xmath48 we have the following result : implementing the isomorphism by choosing an appropriate automorphism of @xmath41 we can arrange to get a _ symmetric _",
    "bimodule where @xmath41 acts on @xmath49 from left and right in the same way .",
    "since @xmath49 determines @xmath50 completely , we are left with the classification of line bundles , which is done via the chern class .",
    "since the automorphisms of @xmath41 are just the pull - backs with diffeomorphism , we arrive at the result that @xmath51 as group where the semidirect product comes from the usual action of the diffeomorphism on the integral cohomology classes by pull - backs .",
    "let us now pass to the more specific case where the underlying scalars are of the form @xmath52 with an ordered ring @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this case",
    "we have on one hand the complex conjugation in @xmath4 and on the other hand , inherited from the ordering of @xmath53 , the notion of positivity .",
    "we want to transfer this now to algebras over @xmath4 as well : instead of general unital algebras we consider now @xmath0-algebras , i.e. algebras equipped with an anti - linear , involutive anti - automorphism , the _ @xmath0-involution _ denoted by @xmath55",
    ". then we can speak of positivity in the following way : a linear functional @xmath56 is _ positive _ if @xmath57 for all @xmath58 . using this",
    ", we say that an algebra element @xmath58 is _ positive _ if @xmath59 for all positive linear functionals .",
    "we denote the positive algebra elements by @xmath60 . clearly , @xmath61 and any convex combination of such elements are in @xmath60 but there might be more .",
    "note also that there are other scenarios where one employs a more sophisticated version of positivity for the price of additional structures like for @xmath62-algebras , see e.g.@xcite .    as before we want now to replace the obvious notion of @xmath0-homomorphism by some bimodule version .",
    "here we rely on the particular case of @xmath1-algebras where this theory was studied first . however , the essence is entirely algebraic and thus works in our general setting as well .",
    "we consider again a @xmath63-bimodule @xmath8 , now together with a _ inner product _",
    "such that @xmath65 is @xmath4-linear in the second argument and satisfies @xmath66 as well as @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for all @xmath69 , @xmath58 , and @xmath70 .",
    "finally , we require @xmath65 to be non - degenerate . in this case",
    "we will call @xmath8 together with @xmath65 an _ inner product @xmath71-bimodule_. note that the definition is not symmetric in @xmath10 and @xmath9 . as a second variant we consider a _ completely positive _ inner product where we require in addition @xmath72 here @xmath73 and @xmath74 and",
    "the @xmath0-algebra structure on @xmath75 is the usual one induced from the one on @xmath10 .",
    "in general it will be quite difficult to determine whether an inner product is completely positive because we first have to determine all positive linear functionals of @xmath75 in order to determine the positivity of a matrix .",
    "however , there are many examples and more particular situations where things simplify . a bimodule with such a completely positive inner product",
    "is then called a _ pre hilbert bimodule_.    the inner product bimodules as well as pre hilbert bimodules are now used to define ( bi- ) categories @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively ) by adapting the notion of the tensor product appropriately .",
    "in fact , it is rather easy to see that the definition @xmath80 for @xmath69 and @xmath81 extends to a well - defined inner product on @xmath82 _ except _ that it might still be degenerate .",
    "however , a further quotient by the degeneracy space will yield a well - defined inner product .",
    "the quotient together with this new inner product then defines a new composition , the tensor product @xmath83 .",
    "it is slightly more tricky to see that also complete positivity is preserved by @xmath83 . in both cases , with this new tensor product we get honest categories @xmath76 and @xmath77 after passing to isometric isomorphism classes or , without identifying , bicategories @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . in the bicategory case",
    "we have to require that the @xmath18-morphisms are not just bimodule morphisms but _ adjointable _ bimodule morphisms , i.e. there exists an adjoint with respect to the inner product . in analogy to definition  [ definition : moritaequivalence ] we can now state the following :    [ definition : strongstarme ] two unital @xmath0-algebras @xmath10 and @xmath9 are @xmath0-morita equivalent or strongly morita equivalent if they are isomorphic in @xmath76 or in @xmath77 , respectively . a bimodule @xmath8 representing an invertible arrow in @xmath76 or @xmath77",
    "is called a @xmath0-equivalence or strong equivalence bimodule , respectively .",
    "the groupoid of invertible arrows in @xmath76 and in @xmath77 is called the @xmath0-picard groupoid @xmath84 and the strong picard groupoid @xmath85 .",
    "the isotropy groups of them at @xmath10 are called the @xmath0-picard group @xmath86 and the strong picard group @xmath87 of @xmath10 .    for unital @xmath0-algebras one can prove that the tensor product @xmath88 of @xmath0-equivalence or strong equivalence bimodules does not require the additional quotient procedure .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that after forgetting about the inner product one obtains an equivalence bimodule in the ring - theoretic sense .",
    "this yields well - defined groupoid morphisms @xmath89      \\efig\\ ] ] by successively forgetting structure . on the level of the picard groups many properties of these forgetful morphisms",
    "have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , even for a @xmath1-algebra @xmath10 over @xmath90 the group morphism @xmath91 is in general nor surjective , though always injective .    in a last step we consider now formal deformations . here",
    "we will consider a unital algebra @xmath10 over @xmath4 together with a formal associative deformation @xmath92 in the sense of gerstenhaber @xcite .",
    "this means we have @xmath4-bilinear maps @xmath93 such that @xmath94 defines a @xmath95$]-bilinear associative product for @xmath96 $ ] where @xmath97 is the original product of @xmath10 .",
    "since we work in the unital setting , we require that @xmath98 is still a unit with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "we will abbreviate this by @xmath99 , \\star)$ ] .    passing to formal power series",
    "gives rise to various classical limit maps , where we set @xmath100 . on the level of algebra elements",
    "we write @xmath101,\\ ] ] which is a @xmath4-linear algebra morphism @xmath102 , \\star ) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{a}$ ] .",
    "if we have two deformations @xmath103 and @xmath104 of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , then for a @xmath105-bimodule @xmath106 we define the classical limit as the quotient @xmath107 the result @xmath108 is viewed as a @xmath63-bimodule .",
    "it is now easy to see that @xmath109 and that the tensor product is compatible with @xmath110 up to natural isomorphisms .",
    "this simple observation can be summarized as follows . to keep track of the ring we denote the category of bimodule over algebras over @xmath4 and @xmath95 $ ] by @xmath111 and @xmath112}$ ] , respectively .",
    "then one has the sub - category @xmath113}$ ] of those algebras over @xmath95 $ ] which are formal deformations of algebras over @xmath4 as above . for the morphisms in @xmath114 we allow _ all _ bimodules and not just those of the form @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath110 induces a functor @xmath116 called the classical limit functor .",
    "hence we also get immediately a groupoid morphism @xmath117 which ultimately results in a group morphism @xmath118 for every deformation @xmath104 of @xmath10 . again",
    ", one is interested in understanding the properties of this classical limit morphism and in particular the behaviour of the picard groups under deformation .",
    "many results on this have been obtained in @xcite .    also for @xmath0-algebras",
    "one can define a classical limit functor similar to : here one considers _",
    "hermitian _ deformations which are formal deformations @xmath92 such that the original @xmath0-involution is still a @xmath0-involution also with respect to the deformed product @xmath92 .",
    "then the quotient procedure for the bimodules has to be modified as the resulting inner product on the naive quotient @xmath119 will in general be degenerate .",
    "thus we have to divide by the degeneracy space and get a functor @xmath120 which also gives groupoid and group morphisms for the @xmath0-picard groupoid and @xmath0-picard groups , respectively .",
    "finally , for the strong version one has to take care once more : the complete positivity of the inner product on the classical limit may fail .",
    "the way out is to allow only those hermitian deformations which are _ completely positive deformations _ , see e.g. @xcite for examples .",
    "after the algebraic preliminaries on morita theory we pass now to the geometric situation of deformation quantization of poisson manifolds .",
    "let @xmath121 be a poisson manifold with poisson tensor @xmath122 .",
    "then a _ formal deformation _ of @xmath123 is a formal series @xmath124,\\ ] ] such that we still have the jacobi identity @xmath125 .",
    "such a formal series is also called a formal poisson tensor .",
    "the set of all formal poisson tensors is denoted by @xmath126 and those with fixed first order @xmath123 are denoted by @xmath127 .",

    "we call @xmath130 the _ formal diffeomorphism _ induced by @xmath129 .",
    "the baker - campbell - hausdorff theorem shows that the composition of two formal diffeomorphisms @xmath130 and @xmath131 is again a formal diffeomorphism @xmath132 since both @xmath129 and @xmath133 start in first order of @xmath134 making the bch series @xmath135 a well - defined formal vector field again .",
    "this way , we obtain the _ group of formal diffeomorphisms _",
    "@xmath136 acting on various tensor fields .",
    "indeed , one can think of formal vector fields , formal poisson structures , formal diffeomorphisms , etc . as the @xmath137-jet around @xmath100 of vector fields , poisson structures , diffeomorphisms , etc .",
    ", depending smoothly on the parameter @xmath134 .",
    "however , we will not need this point of view here .",
    "since the schouten bracket @xmath138 is natural with respect to the lie derivative , it is clear that a formal diffeomorphism @xmath130 maps a formal poisson structure @xmath139 to a formal poisson structure @xmath140 again .",
    "moreover , the first order term @xmath123 is preserved by this action .",
    "this motives the definition that two formal poisson structures @xmath139 and @xmath141 are called _ equivalent _ if they are in the same @xmath136-orbit , i.e. if there is a formal vector field such that @xmath142 in this case we necessarily have @xmath143 and we write @xmath144 .",
    "the equivalence classes of this equivalence relation are then denoted by @xmath145 they are the moduli space for the inequivalent formal deformations of a given poisson structure @xmath123 . in general , it will be very complicated to determine the set @xmath146 for a given poisson structure @xmath123 . by abstract deformation theory",
    "one can say that @xmath147 $ ] is a well - defined class in the second poisson cohomology of @xmath123 but it is not clear which such infinitesimal deformations can actually be lifted to formal deformations of all order in @xmath134 . if however , @xmath123 is symplectic and comes from a symplectic form @xmath148 then the moduli space @xmath146 is easily be described by the inequivalent formal deformations of @xmath149 . here",
    "the result is @xmath150 + \\hbar { \\mathrm{h}_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{dr}}}^2(m , { \\mathbbm{c}})[[\\hbar]],\\ ] ] where we have ( artificially ) put an affine space modeled on @xmath151 $ ] instead of @xmath152 $ ] itself , just to keep track of the symplectic form we started with .",
    "the proofs of these facts are well - known and can e.g. be found in the textbook ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.2.4 ) .",
    "let us now recall the basic notions from deformation quantization @xcite , see also the textbook @xcite for a detailed exposition . on a poisson manifold @xmath121 a _ star product _",
    "@xmath92 is a formal associative deformation of @xmath41 as in with the additional requirements that the first order commutator @xmath153 gives the poisson bracket coming from @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , one requires that the @xmath154 are bidifferential operators .",
    "the set of all star products on @xmath40 is sometimes denoted by @xmath155 and the star products quantizing the poisson structure @xmath123 are then @xmath156 .    if @xmath157 $ ] is a formal series of differential operators we construct analogously to an action on star products : the exponential series @xmath158 is a well - defined formal series of differential operators , now starting with the identity , i.e. @xmath159 .",
    "conversely , every such formal series is of this form as we can always build @xmath160 as a well - defined formal power series .",
    "note that @xmath161 vanishes on constants iff @xmath162 is the identity on constants . now",
    "if @xmath92 is a star product for @xmath123 then also @xmath163 is easily shown to be a star product quantizing the same poisson structure @xmath123 . here",
    "we need that @xmath160 vanishes on constants in order to have again @xmath164 . this allows to interpret the operators @xmath161 as quantum analogs of formal vector fields while the operators @xmath162 are the quantum analogs of formal diffeomorphisms .",
    "we call such an operator @xmath162 an _ equivalence transformation_. clearly , we get a group structure by multiplying equivalence transformations which corresponds to the lie algebra structure of the operators @xmath161 coming from the commutator .",
    "we end up with an action of the group of equivalence transformations on @xmath155 which preserves each @xmath156 .",
    "this allows to define two star products @xmath92 and @xmath165 to be _ equivalent _ , denoted by @xmath166 , if they are in the same orbit under the action of the equivalence transformations .",
    "this gives us the analog of and we set @xmath167    one of the major achievements in deformation quantization is now the famous statement of kontsevich that the two moduli spaces @xmath168 and @xmath169 are in bijection for every poisson structure @xmath123 .",
    "more precisely , the formality map @xmath170 of kontsevich gives a construction where a formal poisson structure @xmath171 is used to build a formal star product @xmath172 in such a way that @xmath173 iff @xmath174 .",
    "the precise construction @xmath175 requires the formality map @xmath170 and is involved , both from the conceptual point of view as well as technically , see @xcite for further details .",
    "thus the choice of a formality map results in a bijection @xmath176    as a remark we note that for a real formal poisson structure @xmath177 kontsevich s formality on @xmath178 produces a hermitian star product , i.e. @xmath179 . also the global formality map of dolgushev has this property @xcite .",
    "finally , one can show that a hermitian star product is always a completely positive deformation @xcite .",
    "the main question concerning morita theory in deformation quantization is now which star products are morita equivalent .",
    "since we have a good understanding of the equivalence classes of star products in terms of the equivalence classes of formal poisson tensors one can refine the task as follows : describe the morita equivalence of @xmath172 and @xmath180 in terms of the equivalence classes of @xmath139 and @xmath141 . indeed , since isomorphic algebras are morita equivalence the morita equivalence of @xmath172 and @xmath180 will only depend on the _ classes _ of @xmath139 and @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , since every star product is equivalent ( and hence isomorphic ) to a @xmath172 , it suffices to consider those .",
    "there are now two reasons for star products to be morita equivalent which we would like to discuss separately .",
    "first it is clear that any poisson diffeomorphism @xmath181 maps @xmath172 to an isomorphic star product @xmath182 where we use in the second step that the global formalities have a good covariance property up to equivalence . since @xmath172 and @xmath183 are isomorphic ( via @xmath184 ) they are morita equivalent in a trivial way .",
    "this is the simple part of the description .",
    "note that for star products quantizing diffeomorphic but different poisson structures we still can have isomorphism via general diffeomorphisms .",
    "however , we study morita equivalence of star products for a fixed poisson structure @xmath123 on @xmath40 .",
    "the non - trivial part of morita equivalence comes from the non - trivial classical equivalence bimodules , the line bundles .",
    "we know from the classical limit morphism that the classical limit of an equivalence bimodule has to be a classical equivalence bimodule .",
    "conversely , given a line bundle @xmath48 one can show that there is a unique way up to equivalence to deform the right module structure of @xmath49 into a right module structure @xmath185 for @xmath186 $ ] with respect to the star product algebra @xmath187 , \\star)$ ] .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the module endomorphisms of this new , deformed right module are in bijection to @xmath188 = c^\\infty(m)[[\\hbar]]$ ] .",
    "hence we get an induced deformed product for @xmath189 $ ] which turns out to be a star product @xmath165 .",
    "being isomorphic to the module endomorphisms this induces also a left module structure @xmath190 for @xmath165 such that we get a bimodule in the end .",
    "finally , @xmath165 is uniquely determined by @xmath50 and @xmath92 up to equivalence since @xmath185 was unique up to equivalence .",
    "thus we get , on the level of equivalence classes , a well - defined map @xmath191 \\mapsto [ \\star'].\\ ] ] it is now easy to see that the deformed bimodule is still a morita equivalence bimodule and all morita equivalences arise this way .",
    "these results have been obtained very early in @xcite .",
    "the remaining task is now to compute @xmath165 for a given @xmath192 and determine the corresponding @xmath141 such that @xmath193 .",
    "the main idea how this is achieved is to use local transition functions to describe @xmath50 .",
    "then these transition functions allow for a suitable quantum analog obeying a cocycle identity with respect to the star product .",
    "this gives a local description of the deformed right module structure and hence also a local description of @xmath165 .",
    "moreover , locally the two star products @xmath165 and @xmath92 are even equivalent and the difference between equivalence and morita equivalence is a global effect .",
    "next one uses a two - form @xmath194 representing @xmath195 , e.g. the curvature of a connection on @xmath50 .",
    "then the idea is to pass from the deformed transition functions to local expressions involving @xmath194 .",
    "here comes now the following construction into the game .",
    "recall that closed two - forms act on poisson structures , at least on the formal level , as follows : for @xmath196 $ ] and a formal poisson structure @xmath197 $ ] we consider the corresponding ( formal ) bundle maps @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "then the _ gauge transformation _ of @xmath139 by @xmath194 is defined to be the formal bivector field @xmath200 characterized by @xmath201 since @xmath139 starts in first order of @xmath134 the inverse is well - defined indeed .",
    "if @xmath202 is an exact two - form then we can build a formal vector field out of the potential @xmath203 via @xmath139 and it is a straightforward computation that the corresponding formal diffeomorphism maps @xmath200 to @xmath139 .",
    "thus in the exact case the gauged bivector field is equivalent to @xmath139 . in particular",
    ", it is again a formal poisson structure .",
    "since the jacobi identity is a local property and since closed two - forms are locally exact , @xmath200 is always a poisson structure if @xmath204 .",
    "however , in general it will no longer be equivalent to @xmath139 .",
    "note however , that the first order of @xmath200 coincides with @xmath123 .",
    "another simple computation shows that the formal closed two - forms _ act _ on formal poisson structures via where we view the closed formal two - forms as abelian group with respect to the usual addition .",
    "then the above results show that we get a well - defined action on the level of derham cohomology classes on one hand and on equivalence classes of formal poisson structures on the other hand , i.e. @xmath205      \\circlearrowleft      { \\operatorname{fpoiss}}(m )      \\quad      \\textrm{and }      \\quad      { \\mathrm{h}_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{dr}}}^2(m , { \\mathbbm{c}})[[\\hbar ] ]      \\circlearrowleft      { \\operatorname{fpoiss}}(m , \\pi_1).\\ ] ] the following statement is now the first main result of @xcite .",
    "the formula was already found in @xcite on more heuristic arguments :    [ theorem : classification ] let @xmath121 be a poisson manifold and @xmath139 a formal poisson structure with first order @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a line bundle with @xmath206 representing @xmath207 .",
    "then the star product @xmath165 obtained from out of @xmath172 is equivalent to @xmath180 with @xmath208    this way , one has the full classification of star products up to ring - theoretic morita equivalence : it only remains to take into account the simpler part , i.e. the poisson diffeomorphisms as discussed above .",
    "it should be noted that the classification of star products by formal deformations of the poisson structure @xmath123 requires the _ choice _ of a global formality .",
    "it should also be noted that in the proof one needs a formality which is differential and vanishes on constants . the global formality constructed in @xcite fulfills all these requirements .",
    "[ remark : symplecticcase ] in the case of symplectic manifolds one has an alternative classification of star products by means of their _ characteristic class _ @xmath209}{{\\mathrm{i}}\\hbar }      + { \\mathrm{h}_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{dr}}}^2(m , { \\mathbbm{c}})[[\\hbar]]$ ] , see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath165 are equivalent iff @xmath210 .",
    "the important feature is that the class @xmath211 can be defined intrinsically without reference to any construction method for the star products .",
    "in particular , it does not rely on the choice of a formality .",
    "the second main result of @xcite is that the characteristic class @xmath212 of @xmath172 constructed from a global formality for a formal poisson structure deforming the symplectic @xmath123 is the `` inverse '' of the class of @xmath139 .",
    "this matches the earlier result from @xcite that in the symplectic case one has @xmath213 where again @xmath165 is the star product from .",
    "[ remark : starstrongforstars ] as a last remark here we note that the @xmath0-morita and the strong morita theory of star products is now fairly easy : from general results in @xcite one knows that hermitian star products are morita equivalent iff they are strongly morita equivalent .",
    "moreover , the kernel and image of the groupoid morphisms are very well understood for the case of star product algebras .",
    "thus the additional requirements of having ( completely positive ) inner products on the equivalence bimodules do not cause any further difficulties .",
    "in many applications one is not just interested in morita equivalence but in morita equivalence compatible with some additional symmetry : here several possibilities arise like a symmetry of a lie algebra @xmath214 acting on all algebras by derivations or a symmetry of a group @xmath215 acting by automorphisms . to combine these notions it is convenient to consider a hopf algebra symmetry .",
    "let @xmath216 be a hopf algebra over @xmath4 which should encode the type of symmetry which we want to study .",
    "then we consider @xmath216-module algebras , i.e. algebras @xmath10 over @xmath4 which carry an action of @xmath216 : there is a left module structure of @xmath216 on @xmath10 denoted by @xmath217 such that in addition one has @xmath218 for all @xmath219 and @xmath220 . here",
    "we use the sweedler notation for the coproduct @xmath221 as usual . in the case of @xmath0-algebras",
    "we require a hopf @xmath0-algebra and the action should fulfill @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the antipode of @xmath216 .",
    "if @xmath224 is the universal enveloping algebra of a lie algebra then @xmath225 corresponds just to a lie algebra action by derivations and if @xmath226 $ ] is the group algebra of some group @xmath215 , then @xmath225 reduces to a group representation by automorphisms .",
    "thus we cover the two cases mentioned above .    in a next step",
    "we consider bimodules . on a @xmath63-bimodule @xmath8",
    "we want to implement also an action of @xmath216 .",
    "we require that @xmath8 is a left @xmath216-module such that in addition @xmath227 for all @xmath219 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . in this case",
    "we call the bimodule @xmath216-covariant ( or @xmath216-equivariant ) .",
    "it is now a simple check that @xmath14 with its induced left @xmath216-module structure is a @xmath216-covariant @xmath231-bimodule .",
    "moreover , the tensor product @xmath15 of @xmath216-covariant bimodules gives again a @xmath216-covariant bimodule by defining the @xmath216-action on the tensor product according to @xmath232 for @xmath219 , @xmath233 , and @xmath229 .",
    "using now only @xmath216-equivariant bimodule morphisms to relate @xmath216-covariant bimodules we obtain a category @xmath234 of unital @xmath4-algebras with @xmath216-action as objects and isomorphism classes of @xmath216-covariant bimodules as morphisms .",
    "not yet identifying bimodules up to isomorphisms yields again a bicategory , denoted by @xmath235 .",
    "there is also a way to incorporate inner products . if @xmath8 is a inner product @xmath7-bimodule with an @xmath216-action then the compatibility with the inner product we need is @xmath236 for all @xmath219 and @xmath69 . in this case",
    "we call @xmath8 a @xmath216-covariant inner product bimodule . for the morphisms between @xmath216-covariant inner product bimodules",
    "we take now the @xmath216-equivariant adjointable bimodule morphisms . again",
    ", it is a routine check that @xmath88 is compatible with this additional symmetry .",
    "this gives the category @xmath237 with objects being the unital @xmath0-algebras over @xmath4 with a @xmath0-action of @xmath216 and isometric @xmath216-equivariant isomorphism classes of @xmath216-covariant inner product bimodules as morphisms .",
    "if in addition we take completely positive inner product , no further compatibility is needed .",
    "we obtain the category @xmath238 .",
    "again , we also have bicategories @xmath235 and @xmath239 in this case , the check of the needed coherences is slightly more involved but still straightforward .",
    "details on this can be found in @xcite as well as in @xcite .",
    "it is now clear how to define morita equivalence in the presence of symmetries : we use isomorphism in the categories @xmath234 , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 to define _",
    "@xmath216-covariant morita equivalence _ , _",
    "@xmath216-covariant @xmath0-morita equivalence _ and _ @xmath216-covariant strong morita equivalence _ , respectively .",
    "the corresponding groupoids of invertible arrows in these categories are then the _ @xmath216-covariant picard groupoid _",
    "@xmath240 , the @xmath216-covariant @xmath0-picard groupoid @xmath241 , and the @xmath216-covariant strong picard groupoid @xmath242 , respectively .",
    "in @xcite many general statements about these notions of @xmath216-covariant morita equivalence have been established .",
    "we mention just three aspects relevant for deformation quantization :    first one can define again a classical limit functor . here",
    "one can even allow for a formal hopf algebra deformation @xmath243 of @xmath216 with deformed structure maps as usual .",
    "then we get again a sub - category @xmath244 of @xmath245 ( defined over @xmath95 $ ] as before ) with objects being those unital algebras @xmath104 over @xmath95 $ ] with @xmath243-action which are deformations of unital algebras @xmath10 over @xmath4 with @xmath216-action .",
    "then we get a classical limit functor @xmath246 restricting to a groupoid morphism on the level of the corresponding covariant picard groupoids , eventually leading to a group morphism @xmath247 analogously , there is a @xmath0-version for hermitian deformations and a strong version for completely positive deformations as well .",
    "we do not spell out the detail which should be clear .",
    "first steps in understanding the kernel of are available in @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the classical limit is already available on the level of the bicategories and gives a homomorphism of bicategories there ( a weak form of a @xmath18-functor ) .",
    "second , one can successively forget information .",
    "this gives groupoid morphisms leading to the commuting diagram @xmath248      \\vtriangle(0,0)/@{>}|\\hole`>`>/<800,300>[{\\sideset{}{^{\\mathrm{str}}}{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{pic}}}}`{\\sideset{}{^*}{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{pic}}}},`{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{pic } } } ; `` ]      \\morphism(0,650)<0,-250 > [ ` ; ]      \\morphism(800,350)<0,-250 > [ ` ; ]      \\morphism(1600,650)<0,-250 > [ ` ; ]      \\efig\\ ] ] between the various types of picard groupoids .",
    "additionally , the classical limit fits into this diagram nicely and gives yet some more groupoid morphisms making the doubled diagram also commutative .",
    "again , kernels and images of these forgetful morphisms have been studied in various contexts .",
    "third , one can study the morita equivalence of crossed products using @xmath216-covariant morita equivalence .",
    "having an @xmath216-action on @xmath10 gives us a crossed product algebra structure on the tensor product @xmath249 which we shall denote by @xmath250 .",
    "moreover , for a @xmath216-covariant bimodule @xmath8 one can construct a @xmath251-bimodule structure on the tensor product @xmath252 , the resulting bimodule will then be denoted by @xmath253 .",
    "this results in a functor @xmath254 restricting to a groupoid morphism @xmath255 and ultimately to a group morphism @xmath256 the same construction goes through in the case of inner product bimodules and pre hilbert bimodules , see @xcite for further details and examples .",
    "in this last section we apply our considerations on symmetries to the particular case of star products on symplectic manifolds which are invariant under a lie algebra action of some finite - dimensional real lie algebra @xmath214 .",
    "thus let @xmath257 be a symplectic manifold endowed with an action of @xmath214 , e.g. coming from an action of a lie group @xmath215 with @xmath214 as its lie algebra . for technical reasons we require the action to preserve a connection @xmath258 .",
    "this is in fact a rather mild requirement : if a lie group @xmath215 acts _ properly _ it preserves a connection , but there are other examples of non - proper actions which still preserve a connection as e.g. the linear action of @xmath259 on @xmath260 which preserves the canonical flat connection . without restriction",
    "we can assume that @xmath258 is torsion - free and symplectic in addition .",
    "it is now a well - known fact that fedosov s construction of a star product , see e.g. @xcite , gives an invariant star product provided one has invariant geometric entrance data .",
    "more precisely , in the situation where one has an invariant connection the moduli space @xmath261 of invariant star products @xmath262 modulo invariant equivalences is in bijection to the second _ invariant _ derham cohomology @xmath263 $ ] .",
    "in fact , there is a @xmath214-invariant characteristic class @xmath264}{{\\mathrm{i}}\\hbar }      + { \\mathrm{h}_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{dr}}}^2(m , { \\mathbbm{c}})^{{\\mathfrak{g}}}[[\\hbar]],\\ ] ] inducing this bijection .",
    "note that under the canonical forgetful map @xmath265 the class @xmath266 is mapped to @xmath267 .",
    "the proofs of this result and also the case of lie group actions can be found in @xcite .",
    "we are now interested in the @xmath214-covariant morita theory of invariant symplectic star products . in more detail",
    ", we would like to have a refined statement analogously to using the invariant characteristic class @xmath268 instead .",
    "first we study the classical limit of a @xmath214-covariant equivalence bimodule @xmath269 between two @xmath214-invariant star products @xmath165 acting from the left and @xmath92 acting from the right .",
    "we know that there is a unique symplectomorphism @xmath270 such that the twisted equivalence bimodule @xmath271 for @xmath272 and @xmath92 has a symmetric equivalence bimodule as classical limit , i.e. the smooth sections of a line bundle @xmath50 , unique up to isomorphism , with the same action of @xmath41 from the left and the right .",
    "one can show that @xmath270 is necessarily @xmath214-equivariant and thus @xmath273 is again a @xmath214-invariant star product . in a next step one",
    "shows that on the line bundle @xmath50 we have a lift of the @xmath214-action on @xmath40 together with an invariant connection @xmath274 : the connection is obtained as the difference of the left and right multiplications in the first order of @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , one can show by this construction that the original @xmath269 was isomorphic to the @xmath270-twist of a @xmath214-covariant _ deformation _ of @xmath50 with respect to two @xmath214-invariant star products @xmath275 and @xmath92 such that @xmath275 is @xmath214-equivariantly equivalent to @xmath273 .",
    "the usage of @xmath275 allows to achieve that @xmath275 and @xmath92 have the _ same _ first order term ( and not just the same first order commutator ) .",
    "in the situation of hermitian star products and a covariant @xmath0-equivalence bimodule one has also a @xmath214-invariant pseudo hermitian fiber metric @xmath276 on @xmath50 and @xmath274 is metric such that @xmath276 is the classical limit of the inner product on @xmath269 . finally , in the strong equivalence case , @xmath276 is positive , i.e. a hermitian fiber metric .",
    "conversely , given a line bundle @xmath50 over @xmath40 which allows for a lift of the @xmath214-action and given a @xmath214-invariant connection , we can always deform the classical bimodule structure into a quantum bimodule structure _ preserving _ the @xmath214-invariance .",
    "this is a simple application of fedosov s construction adapted to vector bundles , see @xcite . in the hermitian case",
    "we can also deform a classical and @xmath214-invariant fiber metric , preserving its positivity .",
    "since in the fedosov construction it is very easy to keep track of the ( invariant ) characteristic classes @xmath268",
    ", one arrives at the following theorem @xcite :    [ theorem : equivariantmorita ] let @xmath40 be a symplectic manifold with @xmath214-action such that a @xmath214-invariant ( symplectic torsion - free ) connection of @xmath40 exists . moreover , let @xmath165 and @xmath92 be two @xmath214-invariant ( hermitian ) star products on @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath92 and @xmath165 are @xmath214-covariantly ( strongly ) morita equivalent iff there is a @xmath214-equivariant symplectomorphism @xmath270 such that @xmath277 is in the image of the first map in @xmath278 and maps to a @xmath279-integral class under the second map .    here",
    "@xmath280 denotes the @xmath214-equivariant derham cohomology where we use the cartan model to define this cohomology .",
    "in particular , we do neither require a lie group action integrating the lie algebra action of @xmath214 nor any compactness assumptions .",
    "in fact , one even knows that the equivalence bimodules are obtained from @xmath214-equivariant symplectomorphism @xmath270 on one hand and from @xmath214-invariant deformations of line bundles @xmath50 with a lifted action on the other hand .",
    "note also , that with the usual arguments it is now easy to lift from the infinitesimal symmetry by @xmath214 to the integrated symmetry by the connected and simply - connected lie group @xmath215 integrating @xmath214",
    ". finally , much of the above arguments can be carried through also in the case of a discrete group symmetry , only the existence of invariant classical objects is more involved in this case .",
    "going beyond the symplectic case to the general poisson case should be possible by using the equivariant formality theorem of dolgushev @xcite which are based on the existence of an invariant connection on @xmath40 : it is again the same classical data one has to invest and whose existence is well - studied under various circumstances .",
    "[ remark : reduction ] it is clear that the question of @xmath214-covariant morita theory ultimately should result in an understanding of the behaviour of morita theory under _ reduction _ of star products . concerning the reduction aspect , one has by now a rather good understanding , starting from the brst approach in @xcite , see also @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the representation theory of the reduced algebras was studied in detail , including some aspects of morita theory .",
    "the usage of invariant star products ( and even better : invariant star products with a quantum momentum map ) will hopefully allow also to treat the morita theory of star products on singular quotients , see e.g.@xcite .                .",
