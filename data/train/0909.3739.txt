    "this is a characteristic of the supernova matter and is in remarkable contrast with the situation of cold neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "the contribution from baryon @xmath109 gets larger with the increase of @xmath2 and is comparable with @xmath93 for high values of @xmath2 .    the contributions of baryon and leptons on the total pressure are presented in fig .  4 .",
    "in contrast to the situation of the internal energy , the nuclear part contribution plays a more important role compared with the lepton part . the lepton pressure @xmath103 is comparable to baryon pressure @xmath113 up to @xmath114 @xmath22 , but for higher values of @xmath2 it is significantly small .    as pointed out by bethe et al .",
    "@xcite , the crucial feature in determining the evaluation of a collapsing pre - supernova core is that the entropy per particle is very low , of the order of unity ( in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath1 ) , and nearly constant during all the stages of the collapse up to the shock wave formation .",
    "therefore , the collapse is an adiabatic process of a highly ordered system .",
    "so , since the supernova matter is characterized by a constant entropy and constant lepton fraction , we shall also discuss the properties under this condition .",
    "this can be done by converting the results for isothermal case ( @xmath42=const ) into those for adiabatic case ( @xmath65=const ) in terms of the @xmath115 relation constrained by a constant entropy .",

    "temperature is an increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , for the same density , the temperature is higher for lower values of @xmath120 .",
    "the values of @xmath42 for various values of @xmath2 are derived , for the two cases , with the least - squares fit method and found to take the general form @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 for @xmath91 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 for @xmath92 .",
    "the results of this study are in very good agreement with those of takatsuka et al . @xcite .",
    "the stars at lower density denote the @xmath117 values for @xmath108 and @xmath92 which are derived from lattimer et al .",
    "it is concluded that the temperature increases considerably when moving from the outer part of the star to the center in order to maintain a constant value of the entropy per baryon .    finally , in fig .",
    "6 we compare the eos s between supernova matter and cold neutron star matter .",
    "the case for supernova matter corresponds to @xmath108 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is thus clear that the internal energy @xmath94 of supernova matter ( sm ) is remarkably larger than that of neutron star matter ( ns ) .",
    "as far as the nucleon part @xmath109 is concerned , the @xmath109 in sm is slightly lower than that in ns due to the large energy gain in symmetry energy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lepton contribution on the internal energy @xmath93 is remarkably larger in sn matter compared to ns matter due to the effect of a large lepton fraction , that is , a large kinetic energy of abundant leptons .",
    "high temperature also contributes to the stiffening , but it is less effective than the high lepton fractions .",
    "the evaluation of the equation of state of hot nuclear matter is a major challenge for nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "eos is the basic ingredient necessary for studying the supernova explosion as well as for determining the properties of hot neutron stars .",
    "the motive for the present work has been to apply a momentum - dependent interaction model for the study of the hot nuclear matter eos under @xmath6-equilibrium .",
    "special attention has been dedicated to the study of the contribution of the components of @xmath6-stable nuclear matter on the entropy per particle , a quantity of great interest in the study of structure and collapse of supernova .",
    "the above eos can be applied to the evaluation of the gross properties of hot neutron stars i.e. mass and radius .",
