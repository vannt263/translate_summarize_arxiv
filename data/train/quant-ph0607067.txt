    "no - cloning theorem is one of the most fundamental theorem in quantum computation and quantum information[1 ] .",
    "the theorem states that there does not exist any process , which turns two distinct nonorthogonal quantum states @xmath0,@xmath1 into states @xmath2,@xmath3 respectively.this restrictions can be successfully utilized in quantum cryptography[2 ] .",
    "although we can not copy an unknown quantum state perfectly but one can always do it approximately . beyond the no - cloning theorem , one can clone an arbitrary quantum state perfectly with some non - zero probability[3].in the past years , much progress has been made in designing quantum cloning machine .",
    "a first step towards the construction of approximate quantum cloning machine was taken by buzek and hillery in 1996 [ 4].they showed that the quality of the copies produced by their machine remain same for all input state.this machine is popularly known as universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) .",
    "later this uqcm was proved to be optimal [ 5 ] .",
    "after that the different sets of quantum cloning machines like the set of universal quantum cloning machines , the set of state dependent quantum cloning machines ( i.e. the quality of the copies depend on the input state ) and the probabilistic quantum cloning machines were proposed .",
    "entanglement[6 ] , the heart of quantum information theory , play a crucial role in computational and communicational purposes . therefore , as a valuable resource in quantum information processing , quantum entanglement has been widely used in quantum cryptography [ 7,19],quantum superdense coding [ 8 ] and quantum teleportation [ 9 ] .",
    "an astonishing feature of quantum information processing is that information can be `` encoded '' in non - local correlations between two separated particles .",
    "the more `` pure '' is the quantum entanglement , the more `` valuable '' is the given two - particle state .",
    "therefore , to extract pure quantum entanglement from a partially entangled state , researchers had done lot of works in the past years on purification procedures[10].in other words , it is possible to compress locally an amount of quantum information.now generally a question arises : whether the opposite is true or not i.e. can quantum correlations be `` decompressed '' ?",
    "this question was tackled by several researchers [ 11,12 ] using the concept of `` broadcasting of quantum inseparability '' .",
    "broadcasting is nothing but a local copying of non - local quantum correlations . that is the entanglement originally shared by a single pair",
    "is transferred into two less entangled pairs using only local operations .",
    "suppose two distant parties a and b share two qubit entangled state + @xmath4 is real and @xmath5 complex and the parameters satisfying the relation @xmath6 .",
    "+ the first qubit belongs to a and the second belongs to b. each of the two parties now perform local copier on their own qubit and then it turns out that for some values of @xmath7 , + ( 1 ) non - local output states are inseparable , and + ( 2 ) local output states are separable .",
    "+ in classical theory one can always broadcast information but in quantum theory , broadcasting is not always possible .",
    "h.barnum et.al . showed that non - commuting mixed states can not be broadcasted [ 16 ] .",
    "however for pure states broadcasting is equivalent to cloning .",
    "+ v.buzek et.al .",
    "were the first who showed that the decompression of initial quantum entanglement is possible , i.e. that from a pair of entangled particles , two less entangled pairs can be obtained by local operation .",
    "that means inseparability of quantum states can be partially broadcasted ( cloned ) with the help of local operation .",
    "they used optimal universal quantum cloners for local copying of the subsystems and showed that the non - local outputs are inseparable if @xmath8 further s.bandyopadhyay et.al .",
    "[ 12 ] studied the broadcasting of entanglement and showed that only those universal quantum cloners whose fidelity is greater than @xmath9 are suitable because only then the non - local output states becomes inseparable for some values of the input parameter @xmath7 .",
    "they proved that an entanglement is optimally broadcast only when optimal quantum cloners are used for local copying and also showed that broadcasting of entanglement into more than two entangled pairs is not possible using only local operations .",
    "i.ghiu investigated the broadcasting of entanglement by using local @xmath10 optimal universal asymmetric pauli machines and showed that the inseparability is optimally broadcast when symmetric cloners are applied [ 21 ] .",
    "+ motivated from the previous works on broadcasting of entanglement , we investigate the problem of secretly broadcasting of three - qubit entangled state between two distant partners with universal quantum cloning machine and then the result is generalized to generate secret entanglement among three parties .",
    "three - qubit entanglement between two distant partners can be generated as follows : let us suppose that the two distant partners share an entangled state @xmath11 .",
    "the two parties then apply optimal universal quantum cloning machine on their respective qubits to produce four qubit state @xmath12 .",
    "one party ( say , alice ) then performs measurement on her quantum cloning machine state vectors .",
    "after that she inform bob about her measurement result using goldenberg and vaidman s quantum cryptographic scheme based on orthogonal states . getting measurement result from alice , other partner ( say , bob ) also performs measurement on his quantum cloning machine state vectors and using the same cryptographic scheme , he sends his measurement outcome to alice .",
    "since the measurement results are interchanged secretly so alice and bob share secretly four qubit state .",
    "they again apply the cloning machine on one of their respective qubits and generate six qubit state @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , each parties have three qubit each . among six qubit state",
    ", we interestingly find that there exists two three qubit state shared by alice and bob which are entangled for some values of the input parameter @xmath14 .",
    "+ in the second part , we investigate the problem of secret entanglement broadcasting among three distant parties . to solve this problem ,",
    "we start with the result of the first part i.e. we assume that the two distant partners ( say , alice and bob ) shared a three qubit entangled state . without any loss of generality , we assume that among three qubits , two are with alice and one with bob",
    ". then alice teleport one of the qubit to the third distant partner ( say , carol ) .",
    "after the completion of the teleportation procedure , we find that the three distant partners shared a three qubit entangled state for the same values of the input parameters @xmath14 as in the first part of the protocol . + in broadcasting of inseparability",
    ", we generally use peres - horodecki criteria to show the inseparability of non - local outputs and separability of local outputs .",
    "+ * * peres - horodecki theorem [ 13,14]:**the necessary and sufficient condition for the state @xmath15 of two spins @xmath16 to be inseparable is that at least one of the eigen values of the partially transposed operator defined as @xmath17 is negative .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that at least one of the two determinants +   + @xmath18=    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +   + is negative .",
    "+   + for the security of the broadcasting of entanglement , we use l.goldenberg et.al . quantum cryptographic scheme which was based on orthogonal states",
    "the cryptographic scheme is described by figure - i .",
    "+ all the previous works on the broadcasting of entanglement deals with the generation of two 2-qubit entangled state starting from a 2-qubit entangled state using either optimal universal symmetric cloner [ 4,5 ] or asymmetric cloner [ 24,25 ] .",
    "the generated two qubit entangled state can be used as a quantum channel in quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation etc .",
    "the advantage of our protocol over other protocols of broadcasting is that we are able to provide a protocol which generates secret quantum channel between distant partners .",
    "the introduced protocol generate two 3-qubit entangled state between two distant partners starting from a 2-qubit entangled state and also provide the security of the generated quantum channel . not only that we also generalize our protocol from two parties to three parties and show that the generated 3-qubit entangled states can serve as a secured quantum channel between three parties . now to hack the quantum information , hackers have to do two things : first , they have to gather knowledge about the initially shared entangled state and secondly , they have to collect information about the measurement result performed by two distant partners . therefore , the quantum channel generated by our protocol is more secured and hence can be used in various protocols viz .",
    "quantum key distribution protocols [ 22,23 ] .",
    "+ we then distribute our work in the remaining three sections .",
    "in section 2 , we present our idea with a specific example for broadcasting of three - qubit entangled state shared between two distant partners . in section 3",
    ", we generalize this idea to generate three - qubit entangled state shared between three distant parties .",
    "to implement the idea , we use the concept of entanglement swapping .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , firstly we define broadcasting of three qubit entanglement , open entanglement and close entanglement .",
    "+ let the previously shared entangled state ( 1 ) described by the two qubit density operator be @xmath19 . using b - h quantum cloning machine twice by the distant partners ( alice and bob ) on their respective qubits",
    ", they generate total six - qubit state @xmath20 between them . therefore , alice has three qubits 1,2 and 5 and bob possesses three qubits 3 ,",
    "4 and 6. + * definition-1 : * the three - qubit entanglement is said to be broadcast if ( i ) any of the two local outputs ( say ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) in alice s side and ( @xmath23,@xmath24 in bob s side ) are separable ( ii ) one local output ( say @xmath25 in alice s side and @xmath26 in bob s side ) is inseparable and associated with these local inseparable output , two non - local outputs ( say ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29,@xmath30 ) are inseparable .",
    "+   + * definition-2 : * an entanglement is said to be closed if each party has non - local correlation with other parties .",

    "+ closed entanglement and open entanglement is shown in figure - vi and figure - vii respectively .",
    "+   + now we are in a position to discuss our protocol for secretly broadcasting of three qubit entangled state .",

    ", alice perform measurement on the quantum cloning machine state vector and send the measurement result to bob . after getting measurement result from alice ; bob perform measurement on his quantum cloning machine state vector and send the measurement result to alice . consequently",
    ", the two distant partners share a four qubit state @xmath34 .",
    "now alice has two qubits 1 and 2 and bob 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "both of them again operates quantum cloning machine on one of the qubits , they possess . as a result",
    ", the distant parties now share six qubit state @xmath13 in which three qubits 1,2 and 5possessed by alice and remaining three qubits 3,4 and 6 possessed by bob . now",
    "if there exists two 3-qubit entangled state between two distant partners for some values of the input parameter @xmath14 , then only we can secretly broadcast 3-qubit entangled state using only universal quantum cloning machine .",
    "the word secretly is justified by observing an important fact that the transmission of measurement result from alice to bob and bob to alice has been done by using goldenberg and vaidman s quantum cryptographic scheme . therefore , message regarding measurement results can be transmitted secretly between two distant partners .",
    "hence , the broadcasted three - qubit entangled state is only known to alice and bob and not to the third party eve. as a result , these newly generated three - qubit entangled states can be used as a secret quantum channel in various quantum cryptographic scheme .",
    "+ now to understand our protocol more clearly , we again discuss the whole protocol below by considering a specific example .",
    "+   +   + let the two particle entangled state shared by two distant partners alice and bob is given by @xmath4 is real and @xmath5 is complex with @xmath35 .",
    "this initial entangled state is shown in figure - ii .",
    "+   +   + the b - h quantum copier is given by the transformation + @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are orthogonal quantum cloning machine state vectors .",
    "+ alice and bob then operates b - h quantum cloning machine locally to copy the state of their respective particles . therefore , after operating quantum cloning machine , alice and bob both of them are able to approximate clone the state of the particle and consequently the combined system of four qubits is given by @xmath40|q_{0}\\rangle^a+[(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\alpha}{3}|\\psi^+\\rangle|00\\rangle+ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\beta}{3}|11\\rangle|\\psi^+\\rangle)|q_{0}\\rangle^b+(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}|\\psi^+\\rangle|\\psi^+\\rangle + { } \\nonumber\\\\&&\\frac{2\\beta}{3}|1111\\rangle)|q_{1}\\rangle^b]|q_{1}\\rangle^a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subscript 1,2 and 3,4 refers to two approximate copy qubits in the alice s and bob s side respectively . also @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes quantum cloning machine state vectors in alice s and bob s side respectively .",

    "+ wootters gave out , for the mixed state @xmath15 of two qubits , the concurrence is + @xmath58 where the @xmath59 , in decreasing order , are the square roots of the eigen values of the matrix @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes the complex conjugation of @xmath62 in the computational basis @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the pauli operator . + the entanglement of formation @xmath65",
    "can then be expressed as a function of c , namely @xmath66 after a little bit calculation , we find that the concurrence and hence the entanglement of formation depends on the probability @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we have to calculate the amount of entanglement in the 2-qubit states described by the reduced density operators @xmath67 and @xmath26 in the range @xmath54 because the two qubit reduced density operators are entangled in this range of the input state parameter @xmath68 .",
    "since concurrence depends on @xmath14 so it varies as @xmath14 varies .",
    "therefore , when @xmath54 , the concurrences for the mixed states described by density operators @xmath69 varies from 0.17 to 0.29 while the concurrence for the mixed states described by density operators @xmath26 varies from 0.08 to 0.15 respectively .",

    "in this section , we attempt to answer a question : can we secretly generate two 3-qubit entangled state shared between three distant partners using locc ?",
    "the answer is in affirmative .",
    "now we show below that the 3-qubit entangled state shared between three distant partners can be generated by two different processes .",
    "+ to generate three - qubit entangled state between three distant partners , we require only two well - known concept : ( i ) quantum cloning and ( ii ) entanglement swapping +   + entanglement swapping [ 17,18 ] is a method that enables one to entangle two quantum systems that do not have direct interaction with one another .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate the problem of secretly broadcasting of three - qubit entangled state between two distant partners . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting feature of this problem is that starting from two particle entangled state shared between two distant partners we find that the action of local cloner on the qubits and the measurement on the machine state vector generates three - qubit entanglement between them . </S>",
    "<S> the broadcasting of entanglement is made secret by sending the measurement result secretly using cryptographic scheme based on orthogonal states . </S>",
    "<S> further we show that this idea can be extended to generate three particle entangled state between three distant partners . </S>"
