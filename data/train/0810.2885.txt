    "a large fraction of the massive star formation at high-@xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath2 at @xmath3 ( le floch et al . 2005 ) , took place in luminous ( l@xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 l@xmath7 ) and ultraluminous ( l@xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath8 l@xmath7 ) infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , respectively ) , and their high star formation rates ( sfrs ) can be expected to result in core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) rates a couple of orders of magnitude higher than in ordinary field galaxies .",
    "most of the sne occurring in lirgs and ulirgs are likely to be obscured by large amounts of dust in the nuclear starburst environment ; however , in the near - ir the extinction is strongly reduced .",
    "because of the likely concentration of most of the sne within the innermost nuclear regions a high spatial resolution is crucial for their detection .",
    "this can be achieved with space - based imaging ( e.g. , cresci et al .",
    "2007 , colina et al . 2007 ) , imaging from antarctica ( see burton et al .",
    "2005 ) or ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging providing resolutions 5 times better than under typical natural seeing conditions .",
    "the potential of the current 8m - class telescopes equipped with ao was recently demonstrated by the discovery of sn 2004ip in the lirg nuclear regions using the naco ao system with a natural guide star on the very large telescope ( mattila et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "in this letter we report a discovery of two sne in which is a lirg ( l@xmath9 l@xmath7 , sanders et al .",
    "2003 ) at a redshift of @xmath1 = 0.0173 ( shier & fischer 1998 ) corresponding to a distance of 75 mpc ( h@xmath10 = 70 km  s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12=0.7 and @xmath13=0.3 ) .",
    "the sne were detected as a result of our _ k_-band search for highly - obscured ccsne in a sample of nearby lirgs using the gemini - north telescope . even though has a high expected sn rate , only one sn ( the type ia , with a likely low extinction ; li 2002 , matheson et al .",
    "2002 ) has been detected in this galaxy before .",

    "observations were conducted with the f110w and f160w broadband filters and with the f187n narrowband filter .",
    "details of the data reduction and photometric calibration of the nicmos images can be found in alonso - herrero et al .",
    "the lirg was next observed with the gemini - north telescope in the _ k_-band using the near - infrared imager ( niri ) with the altair laser guide star ao system ( 0.022pixel@xmath11 , fwhm @xmath14 0.1 ) on 2008 april 21.6 ut ( program gn-2008a - q-38 , pi : s. ryder ) .",
    "the niri images were reduced using the niri package in iraf .",
    "the target frames were de - dithered and median combined in iraf using a bright field star as a reference point .",
    "comparison between the _ hst _ and gemini observations revealed two new point sources , one at each epoch .",
    "the object apparent only in the _ hst _ images is located at 1.9  ( or 660 pc ) and the one seen only in the gemini images at 4.2  ( or 1500 pc ) projected distance from the near - ir nucleus of .",

    "follow - up observations were also obtained using the nordic optical telescope ( not ) with the notcam instrument ( 0.234pixel@xmath11 , fwhm @xmath14 0.7 ) in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ _ k__@xmath15 bands on june 18.1 ut ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we used 35 stars from the 2mass catalog to derive an accurate world coordinate system ( wcs ) for an _ hst_/acs _ i_-band image of obtained from the _ hst _ science archive .",
    "the gemini / niri _ k_-band ( ao ) image from june 25 was aligned to the acs image using seven pointlike sources common between the frames and a simple geometric transformation including shifts in x and y , and the same scale factor and rotation for both x and y. this yielded @xmath16 and @xmath17 for with 0.09  and 0.07  uncertainty in r.a . and decl . respectively .",

    "@xmath19 for the 2004 event .",
    "the photometry of was measured from the images using the snoopy package in iraf .",
    "suitable field stars were selected to fit a point - spread function ( psf ) for each image .",
    "a polynomial surface was fitted to a background region around the object position ( excluding the innermost region around the object ) and after removing the local background the psf was fitted to the object and a residual image was produced after subtracting the psf .",
    "error estimates for the measurements were obtained by simulating and psf fitting nine artificial point sources around the sn in the residual images . for the non - ao gemini / niri and not images",
    "the photometry was calibrated using six 2mass stars within the image field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the ao gemini / niri images with small fov were photometrically calibrated to the non - ao images using psf photometry of three field stars available in both the ao and non - ao images ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "assuming that these field stars have a similar ao psf as the sn , this procedure also corrects for the flux lost in the psf halo around the diffraction limited core in the ao images .",

    "we then edited , calibrated , and imaged our 8.4 and 22.4 ghz vla data , following standard data reduction techniques implemented within the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "since the vla was in c - configuration , the angular resolution of the 8.4 ghz observations did not allow the detection of any compact radio emission , apart from that of the nuclear region .",
    "but our 22.4 ghz ( beam size @xmath14 0.9 ) observations clearly showed a local maximum of radio emission ( @xmath56jy , prez - torres et al .",

    "type ia sne are not expected to be strong radio emitters and have not been detected at radio wavelengths ( e.g. , panagia et al .",

    "2007 ) detected at both optical / ir and radio wavelengths in a lirg / ulirg host .",
    "we carried out the photometry of the 2004 event with circular apertures and subtracted the local background .",
    "the aperture corrections were done using synthetic psfs generated with tinytim ( krist et al .",
    "1998 ) . an asteroid origin for the 2004 source",
    "was immediately ruled out since it is stationary compared to the field stars between the first and the last target frame separated by @xmath1440 minutes .",
    "also no known minor planets were near the source within a radius of 10  at the time of the observation .",
    "a variable foreground star also provides a very improbable alternative explanation given the small fov ( @xmath59 ) of the _ hst_/nicmos frames .",
    "for example , the likelihood of catching a foreground nova would be extremely small given the galactic nova rate of @xmath1435 yr@xmath11 ( shafter 1997 ) .",

    "near - ir - discovered sne in lirgs and ulirgs are not only important for sn rate estimates .",
    "they can also be used to estimate the amount and distribution of extinction within their host galaxies , and follow - up observations can provide us with a better understanding of the behavior of sne within their dusty , high - density environments . to our knowledge",
    "the host galaxy extinction of a@xmath62 mag measured for is the highest observed for a sn so far .",
