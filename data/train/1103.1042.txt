    "<S> we have developed a technique to measure the absolute frequencies of optical transitions by using an evacuated rb - stabilized ring - cavity resonator as a transfer cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we study possible wavelength - dependent errors due to dispersion at the cavity mirrors by measuring the frequency of the same transition in the @xmath0 line of cs at three cavity lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we find no discernable change in values within our error of 30  khz . </S>",
    "<S> our values are consistent with measurements using the frequency - comb technique and have similar accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> precise measurement of the absolute frequencies of atomic transitions have played an important role in the development of physics . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps best exemplified by the measurement of the small lamb shift between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 levels of hydrogen , which led to the birth of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , our most - successful physical theory to date . </S>",
    "<S> since the si standard of frequency or time is defined using a hyperfine transition in the cs atom ( @xmath3  ghz , which is in the microwave region ) , it is a challenge to measure the _ absolute _ frequency of an optical transition for it means that one has to span six orders of magnitude without loss in accuracy . in recent times </S>",
    "<S> , the use of a femtosecond frequency comb @xcite generated by a laser beam in a nonlinear fiber has enabled such a span . </S>",
    "<S> the uniform spacing of the comb is in the microwave region and directly referenced to the atomic clock , while the laser frequency is in the visible region .    around the same time , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an alternate technique to measure the frequencies of optical transitions @xcite , which gives similar accuracy especially when the measurement is limited by errors in spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the technique uses an evacuated ring - cavity resonator whose length is calibrated against a hyperfine transition in the @xmath0 line of rb . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute frequency of this line has been measured to a relative accuracy of @xmath4 using a frequency chain referenced to the atomic standard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rb line acts as a secondary standard in the optical regime and the ring - cavity as a transfer cavity , so that the _ absolute _ frequency of an unknown laser can be determined .    the basic idea of the measurement scheme </S>",
    "<S> can be understood by referring to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ schematic ] . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is brought into simultaneous resonance for both lasers , so that the ratio of the two frequencies is a ratio of two _ integer _ mode numbers . while the resonance condition can not be satisfied simultaneously for two arbitrary frequencies , it can be satisfied if we use an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to offset the frequency of one of the lasers ( the reference laser in our case ) . the resonance condition for a cavity length @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mode number and @xmath8 is the wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> for an evacuated cavity , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the frequency . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ratio of the unknown to the reference frequencies is given by @xmath11 a knowledge of the cavity length ( or mode numbers ) combined with a measurement of the aom frequency constitutes a measurement of the unknown frequency .    although the use of an evacuated cavity enables us to get the optical frequency , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res1 ] shows that the technique is essentially a wavelength comparison </S>",
    "<S> . we must therefore be careful about possible systematic errors due to wavelength - dependent effects . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown earlier that the guoy phase ( due to diffraction ) is wavelength _ independent _ in a ring cavity and therefore does not constitute a source of error @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another potential error arises due to wavelength - dependent phase shifts ( as a result of dispersion ) at the cavity mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> this can modify the resonance condition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res1 ] either due to a constant phase offset or the goos - hnchen shift , or both . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have a good experimental handle to address this source of error , namely to measure the frequency at different cavity lengths . </S>",
    "<S> since the phase error due to dispersion at the mirrors is constant while the accumulated phase due to light propagation increases with length , the values at different cavity lengths should give us an idea of the size of this error .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we present a comprehensive study of errors due to mirror dispersion by measuring the frequency of the @xmath0 line in cs at three cavity lengths . in earlier work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have estimated this error by varying the cavity length , but we could vary it only by about 25% ; here we vary it by almost a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no significant difference in the values over this variation in length . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our values to measurements using a frequency comb , and find reasonably good agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental details are as follows ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reference laser is a home - built diode laser system which is frequency stabilized using grating feedback @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth after stabilization is about 1  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> it is locked to a hyperfine transition on the @xmath0 line of @xmath12rb ( @xmath13 transition ) at 780  nm using fm modulation in a saturated - absorption spectroscopy set up . </S>",
    "<S> the unknown laser is a similar diode laser system operating at 852  nm . </S>",
    "<S> it is similarly locked to a hyperfine transition on the @xmath0 line of @xmath14cs ( @xmath15 transition ) , but modulated at a slightly different frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the two laser beams with orthogonal linear polarizations are mixed on a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and coupled into a single - mode fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the fiber guarantees that the two beams enter the cavity at exactly the same angle , thereby avoiding potential errors due to differential excitation of higher - order cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> the beams entering the cavity have a size of 2  mm and power of 1  mw each . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is evacuated with a pump and maintained at a pressure of @xmath16  torr . the power reflected from the input coupler of the cavity </S>",
    "<S> is split into its two linear components using a pbs . </S>",
    "<S> the second plane mirror of the cavity is mounted on a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pzt is modulated at 35  khz to generate error signals for locking . </S>",
    "<S> the demodulated signal from the unknown laser is used to lock the cavity on resonance , while the demodulated signal from the reference laser is used to lock the frequency of the aom driver . this frequency </S>",
    "<S> is read using a frequency counter with a timebase stability of @xmath17 .    to establish the cavity length uniquely </S>",
    "<S> , the same frequency is measured with the reference laser on an @xmath18 transition , and on an @xmath19 transition . </S>",
    "<S> this changes the frequency of the reference laser by a known amount of nearly 6.5  ghz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then there is only one mode number combination that satisfies eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cav1 ] . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the change of the reference laser frequency by a known amount gives us a measurement of the free - spectral - range ( fsr ) of the cavity , and hence its length .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of measurements at three cavity lengths  177 , 220 , and 315  mm , are listed in table [ t1a ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are three hyperfine transitions starting from the upper level of the ground state , and we have measured the frequency for each transition . in order to keep statistical errors below 5  khz , we set the integration time in the frequency counter to 10  s. then we take an average of 2030 independent readings . </S>",
    "<S> the most important thing to note from the table is that the measured values at the three lengths are within a few khz of each other . </S>",
    "<S> since the uncertainty of the lock to a cavity peak is about 30  khz , the observed variation can be explained solely on the basis of lock - point uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> thus any error due to dispersion at the mirrors is less than our detectable limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is also what we had found in earlier studies @xcite , but there we were only able to reduce the length from 220  mm to 175  mm . here , we see no significant change even when we increase the length to 315  mm .    </S>",
    "<S> .transition frequencies measured at three cavity lengths . </S>",
    "<S> there are two values at each length , measured with the reference laser locked to either an @xmath18 or an @xmath19 transition . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> a constant offset of 351721000  mhz has been removed from all values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t2 ]    despite this minor discrepancy , we feel that our values are sufficiently consistent with the frequency comb results to be able to conclude that there is no unknown systematic error plaguing our spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the measured values in table [ t1a ] also show that there is no discernible trend due to dispersion when we change the cavity length by almost a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly the same observation that we made in earlier studies . </S>",
    "<S> we have given a possible explanation for this lack of wavelength dependence in terms of cancelation of the phase shift and the goos - hnchen shift . </S>",
    "<S> this is another advantage of the ring cavity over a linear cavity ; the goos - hnchen shift is not present in a linear cavity because of the zero angle of incidence on the mirrors . </S>"
