    "the origin of solar activity with its 11 yr cycle is generally understood in terms of an oscillatory dynamo inside the sun ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "while a toroidal magnetic field is generated from a poloidal field through differential rotation , the essence of the global dynamo is the regeneration of the poloidal field from the toroidal one through interaction with turbulent convection in the rotating sun .",
    "the systematic twisting due to the coriolis force generates an n - s dipole moment from the originally e - w oriented toroidal field .",
    "this dipole moment spreads by turbulent diffusion to reverse the old global poloidal field and replace it with a new one of opposite sign .",
    "this general scenario provides a framework for the explanation of various observed properties of the cycle : ( 1 ) hale s polarity law @xcite , according to which sunspots appear in pairs approximately aligned with the e - w direction , but with opposite polarity orientations in the two hemispheres , and with reversal of the orientations between two successive 11-yr cycles .",
    "( 2 ) the butterfly diagram , according to which the latitude zones , in which the sunspots appear , migrate from high ( @xmath3 ) to low ( near the equator ) latitudes as the cycle progresses . (",
    "3 ) joy s law ( also reported in the seminal paper by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , according to which the orientations of the magnetic polarities of the sunspot groups deviate from the e - w direction in a systematic way , such that the preceding ( w ) part of the region is on average closer to the equator than the following ( e ) part .    while much of the empirical studies of the solar cycle have been in terms of the properties and distributions of sunspots , we know that sunspots only represent proxies for the underlying fundamental agent , the magnetic field .",
    "the solar dynamo operates in the sun s interior , which is not accessible to direct observations ( except indirectly through helioseismology ) . at the surface of the sun",
    "the main directly observable signatures of the dynamo are the bipolar magnetic regions , which represent magnetic flux that has emerged from the interior , and the large - scale flux patterns that are shaped by the accumulated patterns of flux emergence combined with the action of flux dispersion and other transport processes ( like meridional circulation ) .",
    "bipolar magnetic regions occur at all scales with a size spectrum that follows a power law @xcite , from the largest regions that harbor major sunspots often accompanied by violent flare activity , to ephemeral active regions @xcite without sunspots , and the still smaller intranetwork fields .",
    "the global contribution to the overall flux emergence rate dramatically increases as we go down in scale size @xcite , suggesting that the global flux balance is dominated by the smallest scales , in contrast to the general visual impression that one may get from magnetograms .",
    "also the smaller scales seem to statistically follow hale s polarity law and the butterfly diagram distribution , although with increasing statistical spread as we go down in scale .",
    "it is not yet known at what scales the polarity orientations become so randomized that the accumulated effect of still smaller scales no longer contribute significantly to the operation of the global dynamo .",
    "magnetoconvection is expected to cause magnetic structuring down to scales of order 10 - 100 m , where the magnetic reynolds number becomes unity so that the magnetic field ceases to be frozen - in and decouples from the turbulent plasma @xcite .",
    "the observational signature of the dynamo mechanism that most directly represents the regeneration of the poloidal field from the toroidal one is the systematic tilt of the bipolar magnetic regions that is statistically described by joy s law .",
    "combined with hale s polarity law this tilt describes how the emerging bipolar regions bring to the surface an n - s bipolar moment that is the seed for the regeneration of the new global poloidal field of reversed polarity , from which the subsequent 11 yr cycle of solar activity is generated .",
    "the observed properties of the tilt angles therefore give guidance to the dynamo theories and constrain the ways in which the dynamo is allowed to operate .",
    "the tilt angles of sunspot pairs have been studied in many papers since the discovery by @xcite of joy s law , using kitt peak magnetograms @xcite , mount wilson magnetograms @xcite , and sunspot group data @xcite , confirming the overall magnitude and crude latitude dependence originally found by @xcite .",
    "in addition @xcite found that 4%  of the bipolar magnetic regions had inverse polarity orientations , and that the spread in the distribution of tilt angles increased significantly as one goes to smaller regions .",
    "the superb quality of the soho / mdi data set will allow us in the present work to explore these properties with much better precision and in much greater detail than has been possible before .",
    "recently @xcite used the set of mdi magnetograms to study the tilt changes in emerging bipolar magnetic regions .",
    "they found that during the first few days after emergence the tilt angles relaxed towards the value expected from joy s law and not towards the e - w orientation , in agreement with the findings of @xcite from an analysis of kodaikanal white - light images .",
    "@xcite further found no dependence of the tilt behavior on the amount of flux or size of the bipolar regions .",
    "both these findings contradict the paradigm that the tilt is caused by the coriolis force acting on initially untilted flux loops that rise from a toroidal source region near the bottom of the convection zone and emerge at the surface as tilted bipolar regions @xcite .",
    "instead the tilt , which is the source of the n - s dipole moment that leads to the reversal and regeneration of the poloidal field , appears to have been established already in the dynamo region in the sun s interior .",
    "the tilt observed at the surface reflects this property regardless of the size or amount of flux of the observed regions .",
    "we have made use of the complete set of 96 minute cadence soho / mdi full disk magnetograms @xcite , which covers the 15 year period may 1996 ",
    "april 2011 . with a pixel size of @xmath4arcsec@xmath5 , the effective spatial resolution of the magnetograms is @xmath6arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "the magnetograms represent maps of the line - of - sight component of the magnetic flux density averaged over the spatial resolution window .",
    "they have been derived from maps of the circular polarization recorded with a narrow - band filter at different wavelength positions within the ni i 6768  line @xcite .",
    "the complete data set comprises 73,838 full disk magnetograms .",
    "some of the magnetograms have defects ( with pixel values nan , which we replace by zero ) .",
    "we have rejected from further analysis the 1572 magnetograms that have more than 100 defect pixel values ( out of a million for each magnetogram ) .",
    "we have further rejected the 2272 magnetograms for which the @xmath7 angle is neither ( within one degree ) @xmath8 ( implying that heliographic n is upwards , along the @xmath9 axis ) nor @xmath10 ( with heliographic s in the upwards direction ) , to avoid having to deal with odd rotations of the coordinate system .",
    "an additional 60 magnetograms have been rejected because the value of the julian date in the header is inconsistent with other header information .",
    "our aim has been to develop a computer program that can be applied to any of the 73,838 mdi magnetograms , to automatically identify the bipolar magnetic regions and extract their properties .",
    "however , it does not seem feasible to make a program that can automatically and reliably identify _ all _ the bipolar regions .",
    "the algorithm that we have developed therefore makes trade - offs between reliability and completeness .",
    "our priority has been reliability , at the expense of completeness .",
    "the regions identified by the program should be truly individual bipolar magnetic regions , rather than clusters of several bipolar regions during times of high solar activity , or chance encounters between opposite polarities in less active areas . by choosing the criteria for an identification in a conservative way to minimize false identifications",
    ", the program will fail to identify many truly bipolar regions .",
    "although our set of bipolar regions will represent a sufficiently reliable sample , it is a sample that is incomplete .",
    "the automatic identification of the bipolar regions is done for each magnetogram separately , without following the evolutionary history of the magnetic patterns from one magnetogram to the next .",
    "therefore the same bipolar regions may be identified in different magnetograms but formally treated as separate , and different regions may represent different evolutionary phases .",
    "thus the measured region properties may include evolutionary effects , which can add to the spread in the distribution functions of their properties .",
    "however , since only relatively compact and well defined bipolar regions that have not yet significantly decayed get identified by the program , processes like flux transport and rotational shearing should not affect the results much .",
    "it is known from previous studies that the number of bipolar magnetic regions increases with decreasing region size according to a power law @xcite .",
    "this implies that the majority of regions are small , near the resolution limit of the mdi magnetograms .",
    "however , as we need to set the identification criteria to reliably extract the largest bipolar regions during times of maximum solar activity , when the magnetograms are very crowded , the identification thresholds need to be set so high that a large fraction of the smallest regions will be missed . in spite of these compromises",
    "the program succeeds , as we will see , to extract regions over the full range of scales that spans several orders of magnitude in flux .",
    "this allows us to explore how the properties of the bipolar regions depend on their sizes and fluxes .",
    "figure [ fig : fulldisk ] shows an example of one of the many magnetograms , with 10 identified bipolar magnetic regions enclosed by their respective rectangular boxes . since the program rejects bipolar regions that are too close to the solar limb ( see appendix , sect .",
    "[ sec : steps ] ) , only 8 of these regions have been retained for further analysis .      a detailed description of the reduction steps with the set of selection criteria that must be satisfied for the identification of acceptable bipolar magnetic regions is given in the appendix .",
    "after the idl program has looped through all the 73,838 magnetogram files , it has written an idl save file with the extracted bipolar region information for each of the analysed magnetograms .",
    "these save files are then merged into one single master file that contains the extracted information for a total of of 245,733 identified bipolar regions , together with the relevant housekeeping data , like time of the magnetogram , heliographic longitude of the central meridian , heliographic latitude of disk center , carrington rotation number , etc .    from this data set we remove the bipolar regions , for which the derived centers of gravity do not lie within @xmath11 for _ both _ polarities , in order to avoid errors that can occur for regions that are located close to the solar limb .",
    "@xmath12 corresponds to the cosine of the heliocentric angle @xmath13 .",
    "this limb zone is conservatively chosen to be this wide to minimize sources of error due to projection effects and noise .",
    "85,654 regions , or 34.9%  of the total , do not satisfy this criterion .",
    "this leaves us with a rest of 160,079 bipolar regions , which satisfy all our criteria and enter into our statistical analysis .",
    "for each of these bipolar magnetic regions the heliographic coordinates for the centers of gravity and the total magnetic fluxes of each of the two magnetic polarities are determined and saved , accounting for the geometric foreshortening effect for pixels away from disk center . using spherical trigonometry",
    ", we connect the centers of gravity of the two polarities with a great circle and calculate the tilt angle of this great circle with respect to the parallel circle that defines the e - w direction , as well as the polarity separation ( in mm along the great circle ) .",
    "for the n hemisphere the tilt is defined to increase in the clockwise direction , for the s hemisphere in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "the zero point of the tilt angle represents a bipolar region aligned along the e - w direction with the preceding ( westward ) polarity being of positive sign .",
    "the tilt angle for regions with opposite orientation thus differs by 180@xmath14 .",
    "our set of 160,079 bipolar regions provides us with a rich data base with which we can test and explore in detail the behavior of joy s law . according to this law the orientations of the bipolar magnetic regions",
    "are tilted with respect to the e - w direction , such that ( on average ) the preceding ( westward ) polarity is closer to the heliographic equator than the following polarity .",
    "this systematic tilt plays a fundamental role for any dynamo theory of the solar activity cycle , since it implies the presence of n - s dipole moments of the bipolar regions , which represent seeds for the reversal and regeneration of the sun s poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the coriolis force acting on buoyant toroidal flux elements rising from the sun s interior is generally invoked as the cause of the tilt with its opposite signs in the two hemispheres . with this process",
    "the magnitude of the tilt is governed by the strength of the toroidal field in the storage region inside the sun and the rise time of the flux loops to the surface .",
    "as we will see , our present analysis does not support this scenario .",
    "the tilt angles have a strong and well defined latitude dependence .",
    "our analysis however indicates that there is no significant variation of the average tilt angles with phase of the solar cycle ( as also found by * ? ? ? * ) or with the amount of flux ( cf .",
    "[ sec : flux ] below ) , although the statistical spread of tilt angles increases when we go to smaller regions .",
    "therefore we will start with a global analysis , where we lump the data for the whole 15 yr mdi data set together , to explore latitude and size variations with optimized statistics , while ignoring the possibility of subtle temporal variations of joy s law ( for which there seems to be no evidence ) .      to establish a well - defined reference relation for joy s law with optimized statistics",
    ", we use all bipolar regions for both hemispheres and all phases of the solar cycle together .",
    "since for approximately half the regions the positive polarity is the preceding polarity , while for the other half it is the following polarity , we get a bimodal angular distribution , with two peaks separated by @xmath10 .",
    "since these peaks are identical except for their @xmath10 separation , we bring them on top of each other by subtracting @xmath10 from tilt angles that fall within quadrants 3 and 4 ( @xmath15 , to make all angles fall within quadrants 1 and 2 .",
    "this gives us a single peak for the angular distribution , which we can fit with a gaussian to determine its position and spread .",
    "the analysis has been made for a set of 9 latitude bins , spanning the range @xmath16 with a bin width of @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding latitude range for the s hemisphere has been mapped on top of these positive latitude bins , since there is no evidence for any difference in the behavior of joy s law between the two hemispheres except for the sign change of the tilt .",
    "we recall that the tilt angles that we have determined for the n hemisphere are defined to be positive if the tilt is clockwise , while those in the s hemisphere are positive if the tilt is counter - clockwise .    the result for the mean tilt angles in each latitude bin , as derived from a gaussian - type fit to the angular distributions , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globaltilt ] as the solid circles with their respective 1-@xmath18 error bars . through this set of points",
    "we have fitted the analytical function @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the heliographic latitude , and the tilt amplitude @xmath21 is the single free fit parameter .",
    "this is the natural choice of fit function if the origin of the systematic tilt is related to the coriolis force , since this force varies with latitude as @xmath22 .",
    "the tilt amplitude is found to be @xmath23    this rather large tilt angle amplitude is in good general agreement with the results of @xcite , but it disagrees with the much flatter latitude dependence found from mount wilson and kodaikanal data by @xcite and deduced from numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : angdist ] illustrates what the angular distributions for the tilt angles look like , here for the latitude bin @xmath24 - @xmath25 .",
    "while the solid curve represents the distribution derived from the mdi data set , the dashed curve is a fit with a gaussian fit model with 4 free fit parameters : position , amplitude , gaussian width , and vertical zero - point offset .",
    "this offset , which mimics the extended damping wings of the distribution in the form of a flat , isotropic background , becomes significant for the smallest bipolar regions , which have a much wider angular distribution with a greatly elevated background .",
    "while this choice of fit model may not give the best representation of the _ shape _ of the extended wings of the distribution , it gives an extremely robust determination of the position and distribution width ( full width at half maximum , or fwhm ) , which is the aim of the fit .",
    "other choices , like voigt functions , give less stable inversions in situations with non - optimum statistics , which we get when we further subdivide the material into separate flux bins .",
    "note that the fwhm is a function of _ both _ the gaussian width and the background offset .      having determined joy s law in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : globaltilt ] ) , we next want to explore whether the tilt amplitude @xmath21 depends on region size .",
    "there are several ways in which we can quantify the region size .",
    "we here use two choices : ( 1 ) the total flux @xmath26 , and ( 2 ) the `` bipolar moment '' @xmath27 , defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the separation ( in mm ) between the centers of gravity of the two polarities , as measured along the great circle that connects them .",
    "it may be tempting to call @xmath27 the `` magnetic moment '' of the bipolar region , but since this term is much used and defined very differently in classical and quantum electrodynamics , we avoid confusion by using the term `` bipolar moment '' for @xmath27 .    since our data set spans several orders of magnitude in @xmath30 and @xmath27",
    ", we use 6 logarithmic bins for each of these two quantities .",
    "figure [ fig : tiltbipmom ] shows the result when the tilt angle amplitude @xmath21 is determined for each such bin . the @xmath21 value of 32.1@xmath14 from the global tilt analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : globaltilt ] is drawn as a horizontal line for reference .",
    "figure [ fig : tiltbipmom ] is consistent with the hypothesis that the tilt angle amplitude is independent of flux and bipolar moment .",
    "it might seem that the points for the smallest bipolar moment bin and for the largest flux bin may indicate a negative slope ( larger average tilt for smaller regions ) , but as these points only deviate by between 2 and 2.5 standard deviations from the global average , they can not be taken as evidence for a significant slope .    although we here cover several orders of magnitude in region size , we should remember that our lower flux limit is at about @xmath31mx , just above the size range of the ephemeral active regions .",
    "we have no evidence whether or not the scale invariance of the average tilt also applies to these smaller scales .",
    "we note that according to the theory of @xcite , which explains the tilt in terms of the coriolis force acting on flux loops that are buoyantly rising from the bottom of the convection zone , the tilt should vary with the total flux to the power of 1/4 , which in fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltbipmom ] would correspond to a steep _ positive _ slope .",
    "with such a scaling law the tilt would increase by an order of magnitude as we go from our smallest to our largest flux bin .",
    "clearly this theory can be ruled out by our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltbipmom ] .    figure [ fig : tiltspread ] shows the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the angular tilt distributions as a function of logarithmic bipolar moment ( left panel ) and logarithmic flux ( right panel ) .",
    "the plotted results represent averages over all latitudes .",
    "thus the fwhm with its error bar has been determined from the gaussian fit model for the angular distributions in each latitude bin ( in combination with the binning in @xmath27 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "then the results for the different latitude bins have been averaged , using the inverse of the squared error bars as weights .",
    "this gives us the filled circles in the figure .",
    "the solid curves in the figure are analytical fit functions .",
    "we have chosen the analytical form of these functions such that they smoothly approach the value @xmath10 in the limit of zero @xmath30 or @xmath27 , because in this limit we may expect the distribution to become nearly isotropic , while in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath30 or @xmath27 a constant value for the fwhm may be reached ( an assumption that might not necessarily be valid ) .",
    "such a fit function needs 3 free parameters to give us sufficient freedom to find good fits to the empirically determined points .",
    "the choice that has been used for fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltspread ] has the form @xmath32 where @xmath9 represents the fwhm in degrees , and @xmath33 either stands for @xmath27 or @xmath30 .    the fit curve in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : tiltspread ] , where @xmath34 in units of @xmath31 mx mm , is defined by the following values of the 3 free parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in the case of the right panel , where @xmath38 in units of @xmath31 mx , the parameter values are : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the somewhat different values ( of @xmath42 ) in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath33 is a reflection of the degree of uncertainty with this choice of fit model with its implicit assumptions .",
    "the model should be seen as a useful way to express the empirical behavior in compact form .",
    "figure [ fig : tiltspread ] shows that the largest bipolar regions have a fwhm of their angular tilt distributions of @xmath25 - @xmath43 , but the angular spread increases dramatically as we go to smaller regions , with an indication of becoming nearly isotropic in the limit of zero region size . note",
    "that the described behavior represents an average of the fwhm determined separately for each latitude .",
    "we have found no evidence for any significant dependence of the fwhm on latitude .",
    "in the previous section with our exploration of joy s law and the angular distributions of the tilt angles we optimized the statistics by shifting all tilt angles that fell outside the range [ @xmath44 by @xmath10 to bring them back into this range , to allow bipolar regions from both hemispheres and different solar cycles to be combined into one single set of tilt distributions , which could then be studied as a function of latitude , flux , or bipolar moment . through this optimization with @xmath10 shifts we erased information on hale s law for the polarity orientations .",
    "in contrast , we will in the present section focus on hale s polarity law and let the tilt angles remain in any quadrant in which they fall , without any @xmath10 shifts .",
    "hale s polarity law states that the polarity orientations of the bipolar magnetic regions is opposite in the n and s hemispheres , and that the orientations in both hemispheres get reversed when we pass from one 11-yr cycle to the next .      a common and effective way to visualize how the pattern of solar activity evolves",
    "is in terms of the distribution of sunspots in latitude - time space .",
    "this representation is called `` butterfly diagram '' , since the pattern reminds of butterflies that fly along the time axis . instead of sunspots",
    "we can let solar activity be represented by bipolar magnetic regions .",
    "having the tilt angles of the bipolar regions we can go a step further and do butterfly - type diagrams for bipolar magnetic regions with different orientations .",
    "this allows us to illustrate hale s polarity law in an explicit graphical way .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : butflynum ] we have plotted the number density of bipolar magnetic regions in latitude - time space separately for each of the four tilt - angle quadrants , using all the regions in our data set , regardless of their size . the quadrants are here defined with respect to the nominal values of the tilt angles for the various latitudes given by joy s law , in the following way : if a given bipolar region at latitude @xmath20 has a tilt angle that falls somewhere within the @xmath1 interval @xmath45 , then it is assigned to quadrant no .",
    "it implies that its positive polarity is the leading ( westward ) polarity .",
    "quadrant no .",
    "2 is obtained by adding @xmath1 to the boundaries of quadrant no .  1 , while quadrants 3 and 4 are obtained by adding @xmath10 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "thus bipolar regions belonging to quadrant no .",
    "3 have the same tilts as in quadrant no .  1 , but with reversed orientation , such that the negative polarity is the leading polarity .",
    "according to hale s polarity law we expect quadrants 2 and 4 to be unpopulated , while quadrants 1 and 3 should be populated in a mutually exclusive way .",
    "thus , for a given solar cycle , only one of the n or s hemispheres should be populated in quadrant no .  1",
    ", while only the opposite hemisphere should be populated in quadrant no .",
    "as the next cycle begins , the hemispheres that are populated get exchanged .    the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : butflynum ] illustrates these properties of hale s polarity law in a very explicit way , while indicating that it is a law that is not strictly obeyed but is fairly often violated .",
    "the familiar active - region belts that migrate from higher to lower latitudes are clearly seen , but only in the n hemisphere in quadrant no .  1",
    "( before 2008 ) , while the s hemisphere belt occurs in quadrant no .  3 .",
    "after 2008 this pattern reverses as the new cycle starts . in comparison , quadrants 2 and 4 are nearly empty , as expected from hale s law .    the grey - scale cuts in fig .",
    "[ fig : butflynum ] have been chosen such that white represents zero , black 80%  of the global maximum value .",
    "while hale s law is obeyed in the great majority of cases , we notice that quadrants 2 and 4 are not entirely empty , and that the `` wrong '' hemispheres in quadrants 1 and 3 are also weakly populated .",
    "as these apparent violations of hale s law appear to be rather randomly distributed , the question arises to what extent they represent noise fluctuations and errors in our automatic region identifications , or are real , physical violations of hale s law .",
    "we address this question in the next section .",
    "let us first note that the frequency of violations of hale s polarity law increases rather steeply as we go to regions of smaller size .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wrongquad ] , where we have plotted the fraction of bipolar regions assigned to the `` wrong '' quadrants 2 and 4 , relative to the total number of regions , as functions of bipolar moment ( left panel ) and flux ( right panel ) . for medium - size and large bipolar regions",
    "this fraction is typically 4% , and possibly less for the largest regions ( although here the statistics is poor ) .",
    "this agrees with the conclusions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who find similar frequencies of violations of hale s law . for our smallest size bin , however , the violating fraction exceeds 25%  with a very steep gradient , indicating that the tilt distribution may get randomized in the limit of zero region size .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our findings for the fwhm of the tilt distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltspread ] , which showed a dramatic increase of the distribution width as we go to smaller regions . as the angular distributions of the smaller regions",
    "not only have larger half widths but also extended wings that appear like an elevated , nearly isotropic background , there is no wonder that there will be significant spill - over into the `` wrong '' tilt quadrants .",
    "figure [ fig : wrongquad ] does not distinguish between quadrants 1 and 3 , because to do this one would need to assign the right cycle number to a given region , which can not be done in a fully unambiguous way .",
    "however , an approximate treatment indicates that the fraction of regions that fall in quadrant 1 when it should belong to quadrant 3 , and vice versa , is similar to the fractions that fall in the other wrong quadrants 2 and 4 .",
    "the circumstance that the tilt distributions have extended wings and elevated backgrounds with significant spill - over into the wrong quadrants could to some degree be due to errors from misidentifications , in particular in crowded magnetograms .",
    "visual inspection of magnetograms for a sample of violating cases however indicates that the majority of the violations represent a real property of the sun . since in the early phase of active - region development , during the first days after flux emergence , the tilt orientation is often found to rotate until it settles to a value more in agreement with joy s law @xcite , and since we in the present analysis do not include information on the age of a bipolar region , it could be that evolutionary rotation of bipolar regions may contribute to the spread of tilt angles .    to explicitly demonstrate in an unambiguous way that many physical , undisputable violations of hale s polarity law do indeed exist , not only for small bipolar regions but also for large ones",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : violate ] four cases ( enclosed by rectangular boxes ) , selected from different phases of the solar cycle ( 27 june 2004 , 4 august 2005 , 11 january 2008 , 16 february 2010 ) , where a large bipolar region has reversed orientation ( being wrong by approximately @xmath10 ) , while in the same magnetogram a prominent bipolar region with the correct polarity orientation is present in the _ same latitude _ strip .",
    "the heliographic latitudes of the four violating regions are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . we have chosen these examples such that the violating and the non - violating regions should be at least medium - size and side by side in the same latitude strip , while at the same time being well separated from each other and all other surrounding regions , so that there can be no question about their identifications as distinct , individual bipolar magnetic regions .",
    "inspections of time sequences of magnetograms confirm that the violations are not due to rotations during region evolution , but are really stable properties of the regions .",
    "the violating case illustrated for 16 february 2010 has previously been reported in @xcite . due to the latitude - time positions and magnitudes of these violating regions ,",
    "we can exclude the possibility that they belong to the `` wrong '' solar cycle .",
    "these violations are clearly incompatible with a babcock - leighton type scenario @xcite , according to which one subsurface toroidal flux belt is the source of the emerging bipolar magnetic regions . if major , stable bipolar regions with opposite polarity orientations appear at the same time in the same latitude zone , they can not possibly be part of the same toroidal flux system .",
    "the reported violations of hale s polarity law may be seen as anomalies , but the discovery of such anomalies helps expose deep problems within a given paradigm .",
    "the bipolar magnetic regions represent the most conspicuous directly observable signatures of the dynamo that operates in the sun s interior . while their general e - w polarity orientations indicate that they represent amplified largely toroidal flux , their systematic tilt shows that the emerging flux also brings to the surface an n - s dipole moment that represents the seed of the new poloidal field that will replace the old one , with reversed orientation .",
    "the tilt angles thus represent explicit signatures of the dynamo process that is responsible for the regeneration of the poloidal field from the toroidal one .",
    "a prevailing paradigm for the origin of the tilt angles has been in terms of the coriolis force acting on flux loops that buoyantly rise from the tachocline region at the bottom of the convection zone , where the dynamo is assumed to operate @xcite .",
    "this paradigm requires superstrong ( 60 - 100 kg ) toroidal magnetic fields without appreciable tilt in the tachocline zone , much stronger than the value for equipartition with the convective motions . as the speed of the buoyant rise depends both on the amount of flux and the strength of the field",
    ", one would expect that the observed tilt at the surface should depend on the size of the bipolar regions .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite has however shown that this paradigm is untenable , since the tilt angles are found to relax after emergence not towards the e - w orientation but towards the angle prescribed by joy s law , and this behavior is found to be independent of size or amount of flux of the regions .",
    "this is evidence that the tilt ( or n - s dipole moment ) is already established in the source region inside the sun and not during the buoyant rise of the flux loops .",
    "the present work supports this conclusion by showing , with much enhanced statistics , that the average tilt does not change appreciably as we go to regions with orders of magnitude smaller flux contents .",
    "an even much more ingrained , long - term paradigm that is shown to be untenable by the present work is the phenomenological scenario , according to which differential rotation creates from a poloidal field a coherent toroidal flux system , from which the sunspots arise .",
    "such a scenario is not compatible with the violations of hale s polarity law that we have presented here .",
    "our illustrated examples where well defined medium - size bipolar magnetic regions occur side by side _ in the same magnetogram and the same latitude zone _ unambiguously show that these oppositely oriented regions can not be part of the same flux system , but that there must be a coexistence of oppositely oriented toroidal flux in the same latitude zones at any given time .",
    "although the occurrencies of violations of hale s polarity law represent only a few percent of all cases , they rule out the possibility of well defined , coherent toroidal flux systems as a source of all active regions , even the large ones .",
    "our results make clear that _ fluctuations _ represent an essential inherent physical property of the solar dynamo , as expected to various degrees from turbulent dynamo theory @xcite .    the fundamental role of large fluctuations at all scales",
    "is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:90deg ] for four selected cases of well defined bipolar magnetic regions , including large ones , which have orientations that differ by @xmath1 - @xmath2 from the orientations prescribed by joy s law .",
    "the existence of many such cases shows that we have fluctuations over the whole range of orientation angles , not only between `` hale and anti - hale '' ( proper and reversed ) orientations .",
    "also the largest bipolar regions are subject to these fluctuations .",
    "our results showing the profound role of fluctuations together with the finding that the average tilt angles described by joy s law are independent of the amount of flux of the regions , over several orders of magntiude in flux , cast doubt on the validity of tachocline dynamo theories , and seem to be more compatible with distributed dynamo models ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "other concepts that are not supported by our analysis is the separation of scales and the separation between a global and a local dynamo .",
    "previous work has shown that the size spectrum of magnetic regions follows a power law indicating scale invariance over the whole range of resolved scales ( cf .",
    "our finding that the average tilt angle is independent of region size shows that also the smallest regions in our sample contribute significantly to the n - s dipole moment that leads to the reversal of the global dipole field .",
    "there is no observational evidence that below a certain scale size the fields no more contribute to the global dynamo . on the contrary the accumulated global effect of the small regions",
    "may even be the dominating one , because it has long been well known that the smallest regions dominate the global flux emergence rate @xcite . since our analysis indicates that even the smallest regions , although increasingly randomized in their orientations , retain a non - random component , their net global effect may be substantial .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of the present paper to quantify the relative global contributions of the various scales , we feel that the artificial separation of scales and division between a global and local dynamo are theoretical idealizations that are not justified by observations of the sun .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about some of these issues that took place at issi ( international space science institute ) in bern during an international team meeting , november 15 - 19 , 2010 , and during a nordita workshop on `` dynamo , dynamical systems and topology '' in stockholm in august 2011 .",
    "one of us ( j.o.s . ) wants to acknowledge the hospitality of stanford university during a visit in march 2011 for work on the data set recorded by the mdi instrument on the soho spacecraft .",
    "soho is a project of international cooperation between esa and nasa .",
    "the identification algorithm has been developed in a pragmatic way , with the selection criteria and thresholds represented by a set of free parameters .",
    "the values of these free parameters have been manually optimized and then fixed , by comparing the program identifications with visual inspections for a selection of magnetograms representing all phases of solar activity , from the most active and crowded phase , to the most quiet phase .",
    "the parameters have been optimized such that the same parameter set can be used for all the magnetograms , for all phases of the solar activity cycle .    once this manual program optimization has been done , the rest is automatic .",
    "the optimized idl program is run in batch mode in a loop analysing each of the 73,838 mdi magnetograms one by one . for each analysed magnetogram an idl",
    "save file is written that contains all the extracted bipolar region parameters with the relevant housekeeping data .",
    "the effective computing time needed to run this large idl batch job at stanford was about 2 weeks .",
    "each magnetogram is analysed in a sequence of program steps , done by separate subroutines . in step 1",
    "the line - of - sight magnetogram is converted to a magnetogram for the vertical flux density @xmath51 , simply by dividing the line - of - sight component @xmath52 with @xmath53 , the cosine of the heliocentric angle , except in the limb zone with radius vector @xmath54 between 0.9 and 1.0 , in which we divide by 1/2.29 , the @xmath53 value for @xmath55 , to avoid excessive amplification ( of errors and noise ) near the limb .",
    "since we later only retain bipolar regions within @xmath56 , the way in which we treat the limb zone is rather irrelevant for the later bipolar region analysis .",
    "the number of defect pixels ( with nan values ) are counted in step 1 and replaced by zeros .",
    "if the number of such pixels on the solar disk exceeds 100 ( representing about 0.01%  of the total number ) , the magnetogram is rejected .",
    "furthermore the average of the unsigned vertical flux density @xmath57 within @xmath58 is determined ( and here called @xmath59 ) , since it is needed in step 3 .    in step 1",
    "we also produce a spatially smoothed version of @xmath51 , and in this smoothed version set everything that has an absolute value below a certain threshold @xmath60 to zero ( thus only retaining the `` tips of the icebergs '' in this smoothed magnetogram ) . for later reference we call this smoothed and cut magnetogram @xmath61 .",
    "the bipolar region identification is based on this version , to filter out the large number of magnetic elements that have high flux density values only over a small number of neighboring pixels , since inclusion of them would lead to confusion in the overall identification also for the larger regions .",
    "the main reason for the smoothing is that the larger regions usually have a substantial spatial gap of low flux density between the two opposite polarities , and this gap gets reduced and is more easily bridged in the smoothed and cut magnetograms .    through trial and error",
    "we have determined the optimum choice for the width of the square smoothing window to be 11 pixels or 22arcsec . for the choice of cut @xmath60 , below which the smoothed field is set to zero ,",
    "we have found it necessary to link it to the overall flux level @xmath59 to enable automatic bipolar region identification with a single algorithm that works for all phases of solar activity .",
    "this link is done by the setting @xmath62 or 30 g , whichever is larger .",
    "as we will see under step 3 , this initial choice for @xmath60 is adjusted incrementally upwards to avoid faulty identifications in crowded fields , if certain criteria are not satisfied .",
    "while these choices allow good identifications of the large bipolar regions , they obviously lead to a filtered suppression of the contributions from small regions .",
    "however , since this suppression does not lead to a sharp cut - off , while the number of bipolar regions increases steeply with decreasing size , our smoothing procedure still gives us a statistically very useful sample of small - scale bipolar regions , although the sample is incomplete .",
    "in step 2 we use the unsigned version @xmath63 of the smoothed and cut magnetogram , identify each `` island '' ( contiguous region of non - zero pixels ) , and draw a rectangular box around each such `` island '' with a margin of fixed width on all sides . through trial and error optimization the width of this margin has been chosen to be 9 pixels or 18arcsec , meaning that the rectangular boundary box is at least 18arcsec beyond the island pixels on all sides .",
    "we need a certain margin width to bridge the gap that frequently occurs between the two polarities in a bipolar region , but if the margin is chosen too wide , we get excessive overlap between the different region boxes ( which adversely affects the consolidation process described under step 3 ) .      in the consolidation process of step 3",
    "we go through all the `` islands '' identified under step 2 and check for overlaps between their respective region boxes .",
    "when two region boxes partially overlap , they are replaced by a single rectangular box that encloses both of them .",
    "this process of mergers is continued until there is no more overlap between boxes .",
    "the resulting number of regions is thereby greatly reduced .    during times of high levels of solar activity ,",
    "when the magnetogram is crowded with neighbouring prominent bipolar regions , our process of merging partially overlapping region boxes may produce boxes that are too large , because they enclose not only a single bipolar region but also some of its neighbours .",
    "this can lead to faulty results , since the extraction of bipolar region properties under step 4 is done under the assumption that each region box contains a single bipolar region . through trial and error",
    "we have found the following way to deal with such cases to minimize the number of faulty identifications :    if a merged region box has a width exceeding 240 pixels in the e - w direction , then there is a significant chance that it does not represent a single bipolar region . in such a case the value of the cut parameter @xmath64",
    "is raised by 10%  to produce a new version of the smoothed and cut magnetogram @xmath61 , and one goes back to step 2 with this new @xmath61 as input .",
    "if with this modification a merged region box still exceeds a width of 240 pixel , then the same procedure with raising the value of @xmath64 by 10%  and returning to step 2 is repeated .",
    "this repetitive incremental increase of @xmath64 can continue for a maximum of 7 times , until the box width criterion is satisfied .",
    "if the criterion remains unsatisfied , the magnetogram is discarded .",
    "when the box width criterion is satisfied , we loop through the remaining , merged region boxes in the magnetogram and apply two additional criteria to decide whether or not the contents of a given region box can qualify as a bipolar magnetic region .",
    "the first criterion is that both the positive and negative amplitudes of the unsmoothed vertical flux density @xmath51 should be large enough .",
    "thus we require the maximum value of @xmath51 to be larger than 200 g and the minimum value smaller than @xmath65 g .",
    "the second criterion is that the fluxes of positive and negative polarities within a box should be moderately balanced , since a box with too much dominance of a single polarity can not be classified as bipolar .",
    "let flux @xmath66 be the sum of all the @xmath51 values for pixels with @xmath67 g , and similarly @xmath68 be the sum of all the @xmath51 values for pixels with @xmath69 g .",
    "our balance criterion is satisfied if @xmath70 . for perfect balance",
    "this quantity would be zero , for a monopolar region it would be 1.0 .",
    "this criterion can not be made too strict , since we know that a large fraction of all truly bipolar regions have moderately unbalanced polarities , with field - line links to other parts of the sun .      in step 4",
    "we loop through all the final region boxes that have passed all our criteria to qualify as bipolar regions and derive their properties . for each of the two polarities we derive the amount of flux and the heliographic coordinates of their centers of gravity , using only the pixels within a box that have @xmath57 ( unsmoothed vertical flux density ) larger than 100 g .",
    "if @xmath54 for the centers of gravity is not @xmath71 for both polarities , then the bipolar region is not retained for analysis , to avoid errors that can become magnified when analysing regions too close to the limb .    using spherical trigonometry",
    "we draw a great circle through the centers of gravity of the positive and negative polarities to calculate the distance between them and their tilt angle with respect to the e - w direction , as described in sect .  [",
