    "understanding the formation and growth of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) in galaxy evolution is a key problem in astrophysics .",
    "some of the largest puzzles are the origin of m@xmath9-@xmath10 relationship ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the role of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback and its effects for quenching star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and how to effectively transport gas to the galactic nuclei to fuel black hole growth ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of quasi - stellar object ( qso ) host galaxy studies have concentrated on nearby systems ( z@xmath60.4 ) using optical observations with hubble space telescope ( hst ) and ground - based facilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the key ingredient in these observations is to achieve the high spatial resolutions necessary to disentangle bright qso emission from that of the underlying stellar population and hii regions .",
    "a range of host galaxy parameters has been discovered , implying that qsos are hosted by many different galaxy types with a range of simultaneous star formation activity ( e.g , @xcite ) , qsos have been found in massive inactive elliptical galaxies , late - type spirals and irregulars .",
    "even with the large range of selection effects , there is a coherent picture that luminous nearby qsos are generally found in luminous and massive host galaxies with a range of morphologies @xcite .",
    "however , at high - redshift ( z@xmath111 ) the picture of qso host galaxies is less clear with only a small number of host systems observed .",
    "high redshift qsos have been found in star forming galaxies with morphologies ranging from discs ( e.g. , @xcite ) to mergers ( e.g. @xcite ) , while some studies have shown qsos to reside in passive , elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most compelling physical explanations of the co - evolution of the host galaxy and smbh , is negative feedback from agn energetics .",
    "there has been mounting observational evidence supporting star formation quenching via qso / agn activity by expelling large reservoirs of cold gas and/or heating of the gas in massive halos ( @xcite , references therein ) .",
    "recent studies have found that the majority of low redshift type-2 qsos ( z@xmath0 0.2 ) contain evidence of galaxy wide outflows on kpc scales with [ oiii]5007  emission lines @xcite ; however their effects on star formation rates are yet to be understood .",
    "similarly , recent integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) observations of [ oiii ]  @xmath12 h@xmath2 emission in z@xmath02 qsos have revealed host galaxies with strong evidence of outflows , and lower star formation rates in regions with the strongest outflows ( gemini nifs : @xcite , vlt sinfoni : @xcite ) .",
    "these observations have given tantalizing clues of qso feedback , yet there is still little known about the z@xmath02 host galaxies ( i.e , stellar mass , dynamics , metallicities ) , and whether they obey the present day black hole mass - galaxy scaling relations @xcite .",
    "as qsos outshine their host galaxies by several orders of magnitude , studying their hosts requires a careful removal of the qso emission , for which a good understanding of the point spread function ( psf ) is required . understanding the psf for ground based observations is very difficult since atmospheric variations cause the psf to change over a time span of a few seconds , making it extremely difficult to model .",
    "there have been some successful attempts to remove the bright qso light using nearby stars as reference to detect extended emission from the host galaxy ( e.g. , seeing - limited:@xcite hst / ao : @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of qso host galaxy observations have used space - based observations where the psfs are stable for qso removal . at low redshift ( z@xmath61 )",
    "there have been several studies that used both artificial and stellar psfs to remove qso light to search for extended emission , which have allowed for several successful studies of low and intermediate redshift qso hosts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . at high - redshift ( 1 @xmath6 z @xmath64 ) , these searches have been more challenging because the angular scales of host galaxies are comparable to the psf halo ( @xmath01 ) and psf removal is dominated by residuals , which makes it difficult to disentangle the qso and host galaxy .",
    "the bigger difficulty comes from extracting star formation rates ( sfr ) and metallicities of the host galaxies , since these quantities can be easily contaminated by qso narrow - line emission with a range of spatial and kinematic offsets ( @xmath6 1000 kms@xmath5;@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "broad - band photometry has been used to model the stellar properties of distant host galaxies , however residual noise from psf subtraction makes it difficult to obtain accurate magnitudes , and there are no reliable tests to distinguish stellar rest - frame optical continuum from the synchrotron emission of the central agn .",
    "a combination of adaptive optics ( ao ) and integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) provides the necessary spatial and spectral resolutions required to separate qso emission from its host .",
    "having spectral information at each spatial location allows us to extract key information about the galaxy that an imaging survey simply can not achieve .",
    "ifs observations provide a powerful technique to remove the bright qso .",
    "this can be achieved by utilising unresolved emission from the qso ( i.e. , broad - line emission , like h@xmath2 ) to construct a pure qso psf image .",
    "this psf image is normalized and then subtracted per wavelength channel in the data cube , thus leaving only narrow - line emission .",
    "if there is spatially offset narrow - line emission , this can be used directly to infer kinematics , dynamical masses ( assuming virialized gas ) , and nebular emission diagnostics of the gas . recently this technique was proven to be effective in resolving the host galaxy of a redshift z=1.3 qso using sinfoni on the vlt ( @xcite ) .",
    "these authors were successful at detecting the host galaxy and were able to construct a spatially resolved narrow emission line map with identified ionization mechanisms and star formation rates ( 100 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "they found that the galaxy dynamical mass and black hole mass obeyed the present - day m@xmath13 vs. m@xmath14 relation within the current scatter .",
    "in contrast , there have been no ifs observations of high - z qsos hosts where the central agn has been shown to regulate star formation . while evidence for qso driven winds at low and high - redshifts have been found ,",
    "only a single case has shown direct evidence that suggests these winds regulate star formation ( @xcite ) . a larger sample of high - z qso host galaxy observations",
    "are needed to build - up a coherent picture .",
    "we have conducted an ifs lgs - ao pilot survey of five z@xmath02 type - i qsos using both keck ii and gemini north facilities to demonstrate the feasibility and limits of qso host galaxy detection at high - redshift , and to obtain a range of qso properties . in  [ obs ] we describe observations and target selection . in  [ data ] we present the data reduction . in  [ extract ]",

    "we compare our results with studies of qsos at similar bolometric luminosities , and in  [ conclusion ] we provide our conclusions . throughout the paper",

    "table [ tabprop ] contains the above information . using our k - band qso spectra ( figure [ sloan_spec ] , right side ) we derive luminosity of the broad h@xmath2  emission line , black hole mass and the equivalent width ( table [ tabpropha ] ) .",

    "the black hole mass was then estimated using equation ( 6 ) from @xcite .",
    "the presented near infrared spectra were extracted from our data cubes using a spatial aperture of approximately the seeing halo .",
    "+      the broad h@xmath2  emission originates from gas located in a compact disk within the central few parsecs making this emission essentially point - like in our observations .",
    "we use spectral channels that confine the broad line emission for psf construction .",
    "our algorithm finds the highest signal - to - noise spectral channels that do not coincide with oh emission lines to be combined to create a master psf image .",
    "generally the selected psf regions are 2.5 - 3 nm ( 10 - 15 spectral channels ) in size and tend to sit near the peak of the broad h@xmath2  line .",
    "we hypothesised that the majority of the extended narrow line emission will be within 400kms@xmath5  from the qso s redshift , where the psf has the highest signal to noise and the greatest potential for contamination from the nlr , so we also select spectral regions that are offset from the peak of the broad emission line ( not including oh sky lines ) , that should have minimal contribution from extended narrow - line emission .",
    "we combine all spectral regions using a 3@xmath10 clipping routine , to mitigate contamination from the extended narrow - line emission .",
    "this way spaxels that do contain narrow emission would be weighted less since spectral channels offsets by 2000 - 3000kms@xmath5  are less likely to contain nlr .",
    "the end result is a 2d image of our observed psf that gets normalized to the flux at the peak pixel .",
    "we then go through individual channels in our data cube , scale the image to the maximum value of the psf at the particular channel and subtract the image .",
    "this routine provided the best residuals post psf subtraction .",
    "some studies have additional steps with psf construction , by initially fitting and subtracting the nuclear continuum with a low order polynomial ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the linear fit is to remove any continuum emission from the host galaxy . in our work ,",
    "extensive studies of the final psf subtracted cube using both methods does not reveal a continuum emission from the host galaxy at the 3@xmath10 level ( average k mag @xmath26 20.9 ) , hence we decided not to include this additional step in our qso psf construction routine since it adds at least 1.2 times more noise in the psf subtracted cubes .    to test the quality of our psf subtraction , we constructed radial profiles at different wavelength channels , before and after psf subtraction , to verify whether the final cube had the central core and seeing halo successfully removed .",
    "figure [ psfsubresults ] shows the results of these tests for two of our targets .",
    "the green and blue radial profile curves are constructed from a spectrally - summed image which contains both broad and narrow h@xmath2  emission ( @xmath272.5 nm or @xmath28v=1142kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "the green curve is constructed from the data cube before psf subtraction , the blue is after the psf is removed and the red curve is constructed from just the psf image ( @xmath292.5 nm , spectrally offset 1 - 5 nm ) .",
    "the points are constructed by taking an average in an annulus with @xmath28r=0.1  at a range of separations from the centroid of the qso .",
    "the radial profile in the post psf subtracted data cube ( blue curves ) have little slope and significantly less flux , and do not strongly correlate with the general shape of the green and red curves .",
    "this demonstrates that the psf subtracted data has a significant portion of the qso flux removed , with only the inner 0.2  being strongly dominated by noise from psf subtraction .",
    "averaging over the data cube along the spectral axis , we find that generally within 0.2  the qso still contributes to about 10 - 20@xmath8 of the total data counts , while only 2 - 5@xmath8 outside 0.2 .",
    "as expected , observations with the smallest psf fwhm showed the best post psf subtraction data cubes producing the best contrast .",
    "however it should be noted that leftover qso continuum / blr light does not affect measured values derived from narrow line emission , since they are derived by fitting the line and any underline continuum left over from psf subtraction simultaneously , at which stage the continuum contamination can be calculated .",
    "to find narrow line emission we searched all of the individual @xmath0 3,000 spaxels in each of the cubes using an algorithm that searches for flux above a predefined threshold , in combination with visual inspection of each cube .",
    "when a line feature is identified we calculated the signal - to - noise by obtaining the standard deviation in the surrounding spatial and spectral pixels , and divided it into the fitted peak of the emission line . for cases where",
    "a faint emission feature is found we bin the data using nearby spaxels to increase the signal - to - noise to distinguish between a faint noise spike versus real emission .",
    "we confirm a detection if the peak of the emission line is greater than 3@xmath10 from the neighboring spaxels and the spectral width is greater than the intrinsic instrumental width of 0.35 nm and 0.20 nm for osiris and nifs respectively . for",
    "bright noise spikes we wrote a routine that parses through the cube and removes them if their counts are 5@xmath10 or higher from the surrounding region ( one spaxel in each spatial direction , and 2 spectral channel two the left and right of the spike ) , some of these features have a fwhm greater than instrumental but given their spatial isolation and significantly higher counts than the surrounding region we quantify them as being `` noise spikes '' .",
    "majority of them are associated with locations of oh sky lines , hence we believe these spikes are residuals caused by sky subtraction .",
    "this routine also confirms faint extended structure in the case of sdssj0925@xmath300655 to be real rather than a combination of separated noise spikes . after searching through the five observed data cubes we identify narrow line emission in two of the systems , sdssj1029 + 6510 and sdssj0925 + 06 . for the given qso redshift ,",
    "the identified emission lines are likely narrow h@xmath2 . if [ nii]6584   were assumed instead the flux ratio between it and undetected h@xmath2  would be @xmath1130 in some regions , this is well beyond what has been found in other galaxies ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "once an h@xmath2  line is identified we searched for [ nii]6548,6584   and [ sii]6718,6733   at a similar velocity offset from the broad h@xmath2  line .",
    "the detected narrow h@xmath2  emission lines all lie within 600 kms@xmath5  from of their respective qsos broad h@xmath2  redshift , however the full spectral axis in each spaxel was examined for potential narrow emission lines that could be associated with structure surrounding our qsos .",
    "all of the line fits were done with a single gaussian function using the non - linear least squares routine provided through scipy .",
    "the initial guess for the peak is the value at the location of the maximum flux , the initial guess on wavelength offset is the location of the maximum flux , and initial guess on @xmath10 was 80 kms@xmath5 , no further constraints were put on the parameters .",
    "the radial velocity map is derived from the measured line offset in each spaxel relative to the redshift of the broad h@xmath2  line .",
    "the velocity dispersion map of the gas is derived after removing the instrumental width in quadrature from @xmath10 at each spaxel .",

    "clearly a larger z=1 - 3 qso ifs+ao sample will be critical in developing a more coherent picture of qso host galaxies during this important epoch .    based on observations obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , ministrio da cincia , tecnologiae inovao ( brazil ) and ministerio de ciencia , tecnologa e innovacin productiva ( argentina ) .",

    "<S> we present integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) with laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs - ao ) observations of z@xmath02 quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) designed to resolve extended nebular line emission from the host galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> we have conducted a pilot survey of five qsos , three observed with nifs+ao and two observed with osiris+ao at an average redshift of z=2.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the combination of ao and ifss provides the necessary spatial and spectral resolutions required to separate qso emission from its host . </S>",
    "<S> we present our technique for generating a psf from the broad - line region of the qso and performing psf subtraction of the qso emission to detect the host galaxy emission at separation of @xmath00.2@xmath1 ( @xmath01.4 kpc ) . </S>",

    "<S> assuming that the majority of narrow - line h@xmath2  emission is from star formation , we infer a star formation rate for sdssj1029 + 6510 of 78.4 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  originating from a compact region that is kinematically offset by 290 - 350 kms@xmath5 . for sdssj0925 + 0655 </S>",

    "<S> the null detections on three of the qsos are used to infer surface brightness limits and we find that at 1.4 kpc from the qso the un - reddened star formation limit is @xmath6 0.3 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath7 . if we assume typical extinction values for z=2 type-1 qsos , the dereddened star formation rate for our null detections would be @xmath6 0.6 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these ifs observations indicate that while the central black hole is accreting mass at 10 - 40@xmath8 of the eddington rate , if star formation is present in the host ( 1.4 - 20 kpc ) it would have to occur diffusely with significant extinction and not in compact , clumpy regions . </S>"
