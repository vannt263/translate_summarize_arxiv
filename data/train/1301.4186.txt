    "the nature of the dark matter is a challenging problem in the modern science . from astrophysical observations",
    "there are gravitational sources which are invisible to us besides the visible stars and galaxies .",
    "so far , we know little about the invisible objects and call them to be the dark matter ( dm ) , which could be massive to gravitate and non - baryonic to keep the evidence of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) intact .",
    "the dm is now believed to be responsible for @xmath3 23% energy density of our universe , where the visible stars , galaxies and dim stellar gas only contribute @xmath3 4% @xcite . from the viewpoint of the particle physics",
    ", the dm may be a particle which goes beyond the standard model , and its identity remains elusive .",
    "one of the authors ( k.c.y . ) has investigated the possibility that the galactic dark matter exists in an scenario where the phantom field is responsible for the dark energy @xcite .",
    "the relic abundance can be used to determine the interaction strength between the thermal dm and the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "a stronger interaction keeps the dark matter staying in the thermal equilibrium longer , so that the boltzmann factor further suppresses its number density . to reproduce the correct dark matter relic @xcite ,",
    "the governed boltzmann s equation shows that the annihilation cross - section @xmath4 of the dark matter into sm particles is of order @xmath5@xmath6sec which is about 1 picobarn@xmath7 ( pb@xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "this @xmath8 pb cross - section interacting with sm particles infers that the dark matter could be produced in recent collider experiments .",
    "if the mass of the dm is of order several hundred gev , the dm can undergo a typical interaction with the electroweak scale .",
    "this is the so - called weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) miracle .",
    "therefore it was suggested that the dark matter can couple to the higgs boson in the effective theory below tev scale and this kind of model is the so - called higgs portal model @xcite .",
    "substituting the annihilation cross - section @xmath9 obtained from the recent wmap data into the formula of the partial wave unitarity given in @xcite , the upper bound on the mass of the thermal dark matter is approximately @xmath10  tev .",
    "some efforts are devoted to directly searching for wimps with masses of order @xmath11  gev @xcite .    a number of underground experiments , _",
    "e.g. _ , xenon , cdms and dama / libra , have being performed to detect the dm directly scattered by the nuclei @xcite .",
    "although the controversial signals were detected by dama / libra and cogent groups , the null result has been reported by xenon100 and cdms groups , respectively @xcite .",
    "the xenon100 data lead not only to the strongest limit so far for constraining the dm - nucleon cross section to below @xmath12 @xmath13 for @xmath14  gev ( and @xmath15 @xmath13 for @xmath16  gev ) , but have also the constraints for cross section to below @xmath17 @xmath13 in the low mass region around 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the dm may be produced at the hadronic colliders .",
    "since the dm interacts weakly with sm particles , they can escape from the detector .",
    "dm signals could be relevant to the processes for jets plus large missing transverse energy ( @xmath18 ) in the final states .",
    "the process with monojet + missing transverse energy @xmath18 final states has been reported by cdf @xcite , cms @xcite , and atlas @xcite , and is one of the main channels for the dark matter searches at the hadronic colliders .",
    "recently , atlas @xcite has analyzed monojets with varying jet @xmath19 cuts using an integrated luminosity of 1.00 fb@xmath20 .",
    "for all of these experiments , no obvious excess has been observed compared with sm backgrounds .",
    "on the other hand , if the dark matter interacts with the hadron via a mediator , it is possible to find out this mediator from the dijet mass spectrum at the hadron colliders , for which the searches by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations have used data from @xmath21 collisions at the tevatron , while searches by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have used data from @xmath22 collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "however , all measurements show no evidence for the new narrow resonance .    in this paper , we take into account in a model - independent way that a dirac fermionic dm can couple to the sm quarks via a scalar mediator , where the interaction can be parity conserving or violating . adopting this framework",
    ", we will constrain the masses of the dark matter and mediator as well as the couplings from the thermal relic abundance , and the recent results of the xenon100 direct detection and colliders involving the monojet measurements with large missing transverse energy @xcite and dijet resonance searches @xcite . some works for the interaction between the dm and sm particles via a neutral spin-1 mediator can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite    in the effective hamiltonian approach with a contact interaction between the dm and sm quarks , which is just suitable for the heavy mediator and has been discussed in the literature @xcite , only an annihilation topology ( usually the @xmath23-channel ) contributes to the processes for the thermal relic abundance .",
    "however , for the general case , not only @xmath23-channel , but also the @xmath24- and @xmath25-channels may enter to participate the interactions , where the @xmath24- and @xmath25-channels can be switched off when the dm mass is smaller than the mediator or the @xmath23-channel is predominant if the coupling between the dm and mediator is much smaller than that between the quark and mediator .",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : chichi2yy ] . )",
    "the mass of the mediator for the dm interacting with sm particles could be comparable with the energy scale of the colliders , so that the interactions can be resolved and the mediator is produced on shell . in this condition ,",
    "the description of the effective contact operator is no longer valid .",
    "there are two possible ways to detect the relevant effect at the colliders .",
    "one is to measure the monojet plus missing transverse energy in the final state , for which in addition to the sm background it is dominated by @xmath26 @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the dark matter .",
    "the other one is to search for the mediator @xmath29 in the dijet mass spectrum .",
    "we will show that the lhc monojet constraints on the dm mass as well as related parameters could be competitive with but not stronger than the dark matter direct detection at the present stage . for the dijet search , interchange with the mediator @xmath29 in the @xmath23-channel interaction",

    "therefore , the contribution to the diphoton production due to the exotic scalar @xmath29 particle can be negligible . in other words , the diphoton resonance experiments can not offer the efficient constraint to the mass of the @xmath29 .    in summary , we have studied the experimental constraints , which are due to measurements from the correct relic abundance , direct / indirect detections , and colliders , on a scenario that a dirac fermionic dm interacts with sm quarks via a scalar mediator in a model - independent way .",

    "<S> we take into account a generic form of a dirac fermionic dark matter ( dm ) , which communicates with the standard model quarks via a scalar mediator , in a model - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> four special interaction scenarios are investigated , where one is parity conserving and the other three are parity violating . </S>",
    "<S> three of them result in the @xmath0 suppressed dm - nucleon cross sections , where @xmath1 is the velocity of the dm in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the masses of the dark matter and mediator as well as the couplings from the thermal relic abundance , and the recent results of the xenon100 direct detection and collider experiments involving the two channels : ( i ) monojet plus large missing transverse energy , and ( ii ) dijet . </S>",
    "<S> the current monojet constraint is not stronger than that from the requirement of the correct relic density and the null result by the xenon100 direct detection . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dijet resonance measurements can exclude a large part of the parameter space @xmath2 , where the couplings for the mediator coupled to the dark matter and to the quarks are small and have roughly the same magnitude . </S>",
