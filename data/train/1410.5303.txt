    "network models are nowadays ubiquitous in the natural , information , social , and engineering sciences . the last 15 years or",
    "so have seen the emergence of the vast , multidisciplinary field of network science , with contributions from a wide array of researchers including physicists , mathematicians , computer scientists , engineers , biologists , and social scientists @xcite .",
    "applications of network science range from biology to public health , from social network analysis to homeland security , from economics to the humanities , from marketing to information retrieval .",
    "network analysis is also an essential ingredient in the design of information , communication , and transportation networks , as well as in energy - related disciplines such as power grid maintenance , control , and optimization @xcite .",
    "graph theory and linear algebra provide abstractions and quantitative tools that can be employed in the analysis and design of large and complex network models .",
    "real - world networks are characterized by structural properties that make them very different from both regular graphs on one hand , and completely random graphs on the other .",
    "real networks frequently exhibit a highly skewed degree distribution ( often following a power law ) , small diameter , high clustering coefficient ( the two last properties together are often referred to as the _ small world _",
    "property ) , the presence of motifs , communities , and other signatures of complexity .",
    "some of the basic questions in network analysis concern node and edge centrality , community detection , communicability , and diffusion @xcite . related to these are the important notions of network robustness ( or its opposite , vulnerability ) and connectivity @xcite .",
    "these latter properties refer to the degree of resiliency displayed by the network in the face of random accidental failures or deliberate , targeted attacks , which can be modeled in terms of edge or node removal . generally speaking , it is desirable to design networks that are at the same time highly sparse ( in order to reduce costs ) and highly connected , meaning that disconnecting or disrupting the network would require the removal of a large number of edges .",
    "such networks should not contain bottlenecks , and they should allow for the rapid exchange of communication between nodes .",
    "expander graphs @xcite are an important class of graphs with such properties .    in this paper",
    "we describe some techniques that can be brought to bear on the problems described above and related questions .",
    "our approach is based on the notion of _ total communicability _ of a network , introduced in @xcite on the basis of earlier work by estrada and hatano @xcite .",
    "total communicability , defined as the ( normalized ) sum of the entries in the exponential of the adjacency matrix of the network , provides a global measure of how well the nodes in a graph can exchange information .",
    "communicability is based on the number and length of graph walks connecting pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "pairs of nodes @xmath0 with high communicability correspond to large entries @xmath1_{ij}$ ] in the matrix exponential of @xmath2 , the adjacency matrix of the network .",
    "total network communicability can also be used to measure the connectivity of the network as a whole .",
    "for instance , given two alternative network designs ( with a similar  budget \" in terms of number of candidate edges ) , one can compare the two designs by computing the respective total communicabilities and pick the network with the highest one , assuming that a well - connected network with high node communicability is the desired goal .",
    "it is important to stress that the total communicability of a network can be efficiently computed or estimated even for large networks using lanczos or arnoldi based algorithms without having to compute any individual entry of @xmath3 ( only the ability to perform matrix - vector products with @xmath2 is required ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider three different problems .",
    "let @xmath4 be a connected , undirected and sparse graph .",
    "the _ downdating problem _ consists of selecting an edge @xmath0 to be removed from the network so as to minimize the decrease in its total communicability while preserving its connectedness .",
    "the goal when tackling the _ updating problem _ , on the other hand , is to select a pair of nodes @xmath5 such that @xmath6 in such a way that the increase in the total communicability of the network is maximized .    finally , the _ rewiring problem _ has the same goal as the updating problem , but it requires the selection of two modifications which constitute the downdate - then - update step to be performed .",
    "the importance of the first two problems for network analysis and design is obvious .",
    "we note that an efficient solution to the second problem would also suggest how to proceed if the goal was to identify existing edges whose removal would _ maximize _ the decrease in communicability , which could be useful , e.g. , in planning anti - terrorism operations or public health policies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the third problem is motivated by the observation that for transportation networks ( e.g. , flight routes ) it is sometimes desirable to redirect edges in order to improve the performance ( i.e. , increase the number of travellers ) without increasing too much the costs .",
    "hence , in such cases , one wants to eliminate a route used only by a few travellers and to add a route that may be used by a lot of people .",
    "the above problems may arise not only in the design of infrastructural networks ( such as telecommunication or transportation networks ) , but also in other contexts .",
    "for instance , in social networks the addition of a friendship / collaborative tie may change dramatically the structure of the network , leading to a more cohesive group , and hence preventing the splitting of the community into smaller subgroups .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background ] contains some basic facts from linear algebra and graph theory , and introduces the modifications of the adjacency matrix we will perform . in this section",
    "we also provide further justification for the use of the total network communicability as the objective function . in section [ sec : bounds ] we describe bounds for the total communicability via the gauss  radau quadrature rule and we show how these bounds change when a rank - two modification of the adjacency matrix is performed . section [ sec : modification ] is devoted to the introduction of the methods to controllably modify the graph in order to adjust the value of its total communicability . numerical studies to assess the effectiveness and performance of the techniques introduced are provided in section [ sec : test_tc ] for both synthetic and real - world networks . in section [ sec : nc+gap ]",
    "we discuss the evolution of a popular measure of network connectivity , known as the _ free energy _ ( or _ natural connectivity _ ) , when the same modifications are performed .",
    "this section provides further evidence that motivates the use of the total communicability as a measure of connectivity .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions and we describe future directions .",
    "in this section we provide some basic definitions , notations , and properties associated with graphs .    a _ graph _ or _ network _ @xmath4 is defined by a set of @xmath7 nodes ( vertices ) @xmath8 and a set of @xmath9 edges @xmath10 between the nodes .",
    "an edge is said to be _ incident _ to a vertex @xmath11 if there exists a node @xmath12 such that either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the _ degree _ of a vertex , denoted by @xmath15 , is the number of edges incident to @xmath11 in @xmath16 .",
    "the graph is said to be _ undirected _ if the edges are formed by unordered pairs of vertices .",
    "walk _ of length @xmath17 in @xmath16 is a set of nodes @xmath18 such that for all @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "a _ closed walk _ is a walk for which @xmath21 .",
    "a _ path _ is a walk with no repeated nodes .",
    "a graph is _ connected _ if there is a path connecting every pair of nodes . a graph with unweighted edges , no self - loops ( edges from a node to itself ) , and no multiple edges",
    "is said to be _",
    "simple_. throughout this work , we will consider undirected , simple , and connected networks .",
    "every graph can be represented as a matrix @xmath22 , called the _",
    "adjacency matrix _ of the graph .",
    "the entries of the adjacency matrix of an unweighted graph @xmath4 are @xmath23 if the network is simple , the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix are all equal to zero . in the special case of an undirected network , the associated adjacency matrix is symmetric , and thus its eigenvalues are real .",
    "we label the eigenvalues in non - increasing order : @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath2 is a real - valued , symmetric matrix , we can decompose @xmath2 into @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath2 and @xmath27 $ ] is orthogonal , where @xmath28 is an eigenvector associated with @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath16 is connected , @xmath2 is irreducible and from the perron  frobenius theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) we deduce that @xmath30 and that the leading eigenvector @xmath31 , sometimes referred to as the _ perron vector _ , can be chosen such that its components @xmath32 are positive for all @xmath33 .",
    "we can now introduce the basic operations which will be performed on the adjacency matrix @xmath2 associated with the network @xmath4 .",
    "we define the _ downdating _ of the edge @xmath13 as the removal of this edge from the network .",
    "the resulting graph @xmath34 , which may be disconnected , has adjacency matrix @xmath35 , \\quad w=[\\mathbf{e}_j,\\mathbf{e}_i],\\ ] ] where here and in the rest of this work the vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37 represent the @xmath11th and @xmath38th vectors of the standard basis of @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "similarly , let @xmath40 be an element in the complement of @xmath41 .",
    "we will call this element a _ virtual edge _ for the graph @xmath16 .",
    "we can construct a new graph @xmath42 obtained from @xmath16 by adding the virtual edge @xmath0 to the graph .",
    "this procedure will be referred to as the _ updating _ of the virtual edge @xmath0 .",
    "the adjacency matrix of the resulting graph is @xmath43 , \\quad w=[\\mathbf{e}_j,\\mathbf{e}_i].\\ ] ] hence , these two operations can both be described as rank - two modifications of the adjacency matrix of the original graph .",
    "the operation of downdating an edge and successively updating a virtual edge will be referred to as _",
    "rewiring_.    these operations are all performed in a symmetric fashion , since in this paper we consider exclusively undirected networks .",
    "one of the main goals when analyzing a network is to identify the most influential nodes in the network . over the years , various measures of the importance , or centrality , of nodes",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "in particular the _ ( exponential ) subgraph centrality _ of a node @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) is defined as the @xmath11th diagonal element of the matrix exponential @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 identity matrix . as it is well known in graph theory , given an adjacency matrix @xmath2 of an unweighted network and @xmath47 , the element @xmath48 counts the total number of walks of length @xmath17 starting from node @xmath11 and ending at node @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the subgraph centrality of node @xmath11 counts the total number of closed walks centered at node @xmath11 , weighting walks of length @xmath17 by a factor @xmath49 , hence giving more importance to shorter walks .",
    "the subgraph centrality then accounts for the returnability of the information to the node which was the source of this same information .",
    "likewise , the off - diagonal entries of the adjacency matrix @xmath50 ( _ subgraph communicability _ of nodes @xmath11 and @xmath38 ) account for the ability of nodes @xmath11 and @xmath38 to exchange information @xcite .",
    "starting from these observations and with the aim of reducing the cost of the computation of the rankings , in @xcite it was suggested to use as a centrality measure the _ total communicability of a node _ @xmath11 , defined as the @xmath11th entry of the vector @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the vector of all ones : @xmath53_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left[e^a\\right]_{ij}.\\ ] ] this measure of centrality is given by a weighted sum of walks from every node in the network ( including node @xmath11 itself ) , and thus quantifies both the ability of a node to spread information across the network and the returnability of the information to the node itself .",
    "the value resulting from summing these quantities over all the nodes can be interpreted as a global measure of how effectively the communication takes place across the whole network .",
    "this index is called _ total ( network ) communicability _ @xcite and can be written as @xmath54 this value can be efficiently computed , e.g. , by means of a krylov method as implemented in s.  gttel s matlab toolbox ` funm_kryl ` see @xcite or by lanczos - based techniques as discussed below . in the toolbox @xcite an efficient algorithm for evaluating @xmath55 is implemented ; with this method the vector @xmath51 can be constructed in roughly @xmath56 operations ( note that the prefactor can vary for different types of networks ) and the total communicability is easily derived .",
    "as it is clear from its definition , the value of @xmath57 may be very large .",
    "several normalizations have been proposed ; the simplest is the normalization by the number of nodes @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) , which we will use throughout the paper .",
    "it is easy to prove that the normalized total communicability satisfies @xmath58 where the lower bound is attained by the graph with @xmath7 nodes and no edges and the upper bound is attained by the complete graph with @xmath7 nodes .",
    "[ rem : lambda1 ] the last equality in equation shows that the main contribution to the value of @xmath57 is likely to come from the term @xmath59 .      as already mentioned , the total communicability provides a good measure of how efficiently information ( in the broad sense of the term ) is diffused across the network .",
    "typically , very high values of @xmath57 are observed for highly optimized infrastructure networks ( such as airline routes or computer networks ) and for highly cohesive social and information networks ( like certain type of collaboration networks ) .",
    "conversely , the total network communicability is relatively low for spatially extended , grid - like networks ( such as many road networks ) or for networks that consist of two or more communities with poor communication between them ( such as the zachary network ) . as a further example , reduced values of the communicability between different brain regions",
    "have been detected in stroke patients compared to healthy individuals @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extensive survey on communicability , including applications for which it has been found to be useful .",
    "another reason in support of the use of the total communicability as an objective function is that it is closely related to the _ natural connectivity _ ( or _ free energy _ ) of the network , while being dramatically easier to compute ; see section [ sec : nc+gap ] below .",
    "sparse networks with high values of @xmath57 are very well connected and thus less likely to be disrupted by either random failures or targeted attacks leading to the loss of edges .",
    "this justifies trying to design sparse networks with high values of the total communicability .",
    "an important observation is that the total network communicability @xmath57 can be interpreted in at least two different ways .",
    "since it is given by the sum of all the pairwise communicabilities @xmath60_{ij}$ ] , it is a global measure of the ability of the network to diffuse information .",
    "however , recalling the definition ( [ tnc ] ) of total node communicability , the normalized total communicability can also be seen as  the average total communicability \" of the nodes in the network : @xmath61 since the total node communicability is a centrality measure @xcite , our goal can then be rephrased as the problem of constructing sparse networks having high average node centrality , where the node centrality is given by total node communicability .",
    "since this is merely one of a large number of centrality measures proposed in the literature , it is a legitimate question to ask why the total node communicability should be used instead of a different centrality index . in other words , given any node centrality function @xmath62 , we could consider instead the problem of , say , adding a prescribed number of edges so as to maximize the increase in the global average centrality @xmath63    as it turns out , most other centrality indices are either computationally too expensive to work with ( at least for large networks ) , or lead to objective functions which do not make much sense .",
    "the following is a brief discussion of some of the most popular centrality indices used in the field of network science .    1 .",
    "* degree : * consider first the simplest centrality index , the degree .",
    "obviously , adding @xmath64 edges according to _ any _ criteria will produce exacty the same variation in the average degree of a network .",
    "hence , one may as well add edges at random .",
    "doing so , however , can not be expected to be greatly beneficial if the goal is to improve the robustness or efficiency of the network .",
    "* eigenvector centrality : * let @xmath65 be the principal eigenvector of @xmath2 , normalized so that @xmath66 .",
    "the eigenvector centrality of node @xmath33 is the @xmath11th component of @xmath65 , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the problem of maximizing the average eigenvector centrality @xmath67 subject to the constraint @xmath66 has as its only solution @xmath68 this implies that @xmath2 has constant row sums or , in other words , that the graph is regular  every node in @xmath16 has the same degree .",
    "hence , any heuristic aimed at maximizing the average eigenvector centrality will result in graphs that are close to being regular .",
    "however , regular graph topologies are not , _ per se _ , endowed with any especially good properties when it comes to diffusing information or being robust : think of a cycle graph , for example .",
    "regular graphs _ can _ be very well connected and robust ( this is the case of expander graphs ) , but there is no reason to think that simply making the degree distribution of a given network more regular will improve its expansion properties .",
    "* subgraph centrality * : the average subgraph centrality of a network is known in the literature as the normalized _ estrada index _ : @xmath69_{ii } = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n   e^{\\lambda_i}.\\ ] ] it can also be interpreted as the average self - communicability of the nodes . as we mentioned , this is a lower bound for the average total communicability .",
    "evaluation of this quantity requires knowledge of all @xmath7 diagonal entries of @xmath3 , or of all the eigenvalues of @xmath2 and is therefore much more expensive to compute .",
    "the heuristics we derive in this paper have a similar effect on @xmath57 and on the estrada index , as we demonstrate in section [ sec : nc+gap ] .",
    "so , using subgraph centrality instead of total communicability centrality would lead to exactly the same heuristics and results , with the disadvantage that evaluating the objective function , if necessary , would be much more expensive .",
    "katz centrality * : the katz centrality of node @xmath33 is defined as the @xmath11th row sum of the matrix resolvent @xmath70 , where the parameter @xmath71 is chosen in the interval @xmath72 , so that the power series expansion @xmath73 is convergent @xcite . since this centrality measure",
    "can be interpreted in terms of walks , using it instead of the total communicability would lead to the same heuristics and very similar results , especially when @xmath71 is sufficiently close to @xmath74 or if the spectral gap @xmath75 is large ; see @xcite .",
    "using katz centrality , however , requires the careful selection of the parameter @xmath71 , which leads to some complications .",
    "for example , after each update one needs to recompute the dominant eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix in order to check whether the value of @xmath71 used is still within the range of permissible values or if it has to be reduced , making this approach computationally very expensive .",
    "this problem does not arise if the matrix exponential is used instead of the resolvent .",
    "* other centrality measures * : so far we have only discussed centrality measures that can be expressed in terms of the adjacency matrix @xmath2 .",
    "these centrality measures are all connected to the notion of walk in a graph , and they can often be understood in terms of spectral graph theory .",
    "other popular centrality measures , such as betweenness centrality and closeness centrality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) do not have a simple formulation in terms of matrix properties .",
    "they are based on the assumption that all communication in a graph tends to take place along shortest paths , which is not always the case ( this was a major motivation for the introduction of walk - based measures , which postulate that communication between nodes can take place along walks of any length , with a preference towards shorter ones ) .",
    "a further disadvantage is that they are quite expensive to compute , although randomized approximations can bring the cost down to acceptable levels @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we do not consider them in this paper , where the focus is on linear algebraic techniques .",
    "it remains an open question whether heuristics for manipulating graph edges so as to tune some gloabl average of these centrality measures can lead to networks with desirable connectivity and robustness properties .    finally ,",
    "in view of the bounds ( [ coarse_bounds ] ) , the evolution of the total communicability under network modifications is closely tied to the evolution of the dominant eigenvalue @xmath76 .",
    "this quantity plays a crucial role in network analysis , for example in the definition of the _ epidemic threshold _ ;",
    "see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite . in particular , a decrease in the total network communicability can be expected to lead to an increase in the epidemic threshold .",
    "thus , edge modification techniques developed for tuning @xmath57 can potentially be used to alter epidemics dynamics .",
    "in the previous section we saw the simple bounds ( [ coarse_bounds ] ) on the normalized total network communicability .",
    "more refined bounds for this index can be obtained by means of quadrature rules as described in @xcite .",
    "the following theorem contains our result on the bounds for the normalized total communicability .",
    "[ thm : bounds ] let @xmath2 be the adjacency matrix of an unweighted and undirected network .",
    "then @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] is an interval containing the spectrum of @xmath79 ( i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 is the negative mean of the degrees , @xmath83 is the standard deviation , and @xmath84    a proof of this result can be found in the supplementary materials accompanying the paper .",
    "analogous bounds can be found for the adjacency matrix of the graph after performing a downdate or an update .",
    "these results are summarized in the following corollaries .",
    "[ dwdt ] [ downdating ] let @xmath85 , where @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] be the adjacency matrix of an unweighted and undirected network obtained after the downdate of the edge @xmath0 from the matrix @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath88 , where @xmath15 is the degree of node @xmath11 in the original graph . then @xmath89 where @xmath90 \\gamma_{-}=\\sqrt{\\gamma_1 ^ 2-\\frac{2}{n}\\left(d_i+d_j-1 + 2\\omega_1 + \\frac{2}{n}\\right ) } \\end{array } \\right . , \\ ] ] @xmath91 and @xmath92 are approximation of the smallest and largest eigenvalues of @xmath93 respectively , and @xmath94 is defined as in equation with @xmath95 .",
    "note that if bounds @xmath71 and @xmath96 for the extremal eigenvalues of the original matrix are known , we can then use @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , if we order the eigenvalues of @xmath99 in non  increasing order @xmath100 we obtain , as a consequence of weyl s theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3 ) ) , that @xmath101    furthermore , the perron ",
    "frobenius theorem ensures that , when performing a downdate , the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix can not increase ; hence , we deduce the more stringent bounds @xmath102    similarly , we can derive bounds for the normalized total communicability of the matrix @xmath103 obtained from the matrix @xmath2 after performing the update of the virtual edge @xmath0 .",
    "[ updt ] [ updating ] let @xmath104 , where @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] be the adjacency matrix of an unweighted and undirected network obtained after the update of the virtual edge @xmath0 in the matrix @xmath2 .",

    "in fact , the spectrum of the rank - two symmetric perturbations @xmath113 and @xmath114 is @xmath115 and hence we can use weyl s theorem as before and then improve the upper bound using the perron  frobenius theorem .    in the next section",
    "we will see how the new bounds can be used to guide the updating and downdating process .",
    "in this section we develop techniques that allow us to tackle the following problems .",
    "* downdate : select @xmath64 edges that can be downdated from the network without disconnecting it and that cause the smallest drop in the total communicability of the graph ; * update : select @xmath64 edges to be added to the network ( without creating self  loops or multiple edges ) so as to increase as much as possible the total communicability of the graph ; * rewire : select @xmath64 edges to be rewired in the network so as to increase as much as possible the value of @xmath57 .",
    "the rewiring process must not disconnect the network or create self  loops or multiple edges in the graph .",
    "as we will show below , ( p3 ) can be solved using combinations of methods developed to solve ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) .",
    "hence , we first focus on the downdate and the update separately .",
    "note that to decrease as little as possible the total communicability when removing an edge it would suffice to select @xmath116 so as to minimize the quantities @xmath117 since @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , to increase as much as possible @xmath57 by addition of a virtual edge , it would suffice to select @xmath119 that maximizes the differences @xmath120 however , it is easy to show that in general one can not find a choice for @xmath121 that works for all such @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , numerical experiments on small synthetic graphs ( not shown here ) show that in general the optimal edge selection for @xmath122 is different from the one for @xmath123 . because of this , it is unlikely that one can find a simple  closed form solution \" to the problem , and we need to develop approximation techniques .",
    "the majority of the heuristics we will develop are based on new edge centrality measures .",
    "the idea underlying these is that it seems reasonable to assume that an edge is more likely used as communication channel if its adjacent nodes are given a lot of information to spread .",
    "we thus introduce three new centrality measures for edges based on this principle : edges connecting important nodes are themselves important .",
    "this definition , based on the subgraph centrality of nodes , exploits the fact that the matrix exponential is symmetric positive definite and hence @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the diagonal elements of @xmath3 somehow control its off - diagonal entries , hence they may contain enough information to infer the `` payload '' of the edges or of the virtual edges of interest .",
    "it is important to observe that when the spectral gap @xmath128 is `` large enough '' , then the subgraph centrality @xmath129 and the total communicability centrality @xmath130_i$ ] are essentially determined by @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; it follows that in this case the two centrality measures introduced and a centrality measure based on the eigenvector centrality for nodes can be expected to provide similar rankings .",
    "this is especially true when attention is restricted to the top edges ( or nodes ) .",
    "this observation motivates the introduction of the following edge centrality measure .          where @xmath135 is the leading eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath99 and @xmath136 is the leading eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath103 , as defined in section [ sec : background ] .",
    "these inequalities show that the edge eigenvector centrality of an existing / virtual edge @xmath0 is strictly connected to the change in the value of the leading eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , which influences the evolution of the total communicability when we modify @xmath2 ( see remark [ rem : lambda1 ] ) .",
    "note that we defined these measures of centrality for both existing and virtual edges ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this as well as the justification for these definitions will become clear in the next subsections .    we now discuss how to use these definitions to tackle the problems previously described . the computational aspects concerning the implementation of the heuristics we are about to introduce and the derivation of their computational costs are described in the supplementary materials .",
    "the downdate of any edge in the network will result in a reduction of its total communicability .",
    "note that since we are focusing on the case of connected networks , we will only perform downdates that keep the resulting graph connected . in practice , it is desirable to further restrict the choice of downdates to a subset of all existing edges , on the basis of criteria to be discussed shortly .    an  optimal \" approach would select at each step of the downdating process a candidate edge corresponding to the minimum decrease of communicability . note that for large networks this method is too costly to be practical . for this reason we aim to develop inexpensive techniques that will hopefully give close  to  optimal results . nevertheless , for small networks we will use the  optimal \" approach ( where we systematically try all feasible edges and delete the one causing the least drop in total communicability ) as a baseline method against which we compare the various algorithms discussed below .",
    "this method will be henceforth referred to as optimal .",
    "the next methods we introduce perform the downdate of the lowest ranked existing edge according to the edge centrality measures previously introduced whose removal does not disconnect the network .",
    "we will refer to these methods as subgraph , nodetc , and eigenvector , which are based on definitions [ def : subgraph ] , [ def : tc_edge ] , and [ def : eigenvector ] , respectively . from the point of view of the communicability",
    ", these methods downdate an edge connecting two nodes which are peripheral ( i.e. , have low centrality ) and therefore are not expected to give a large contribution to the spread of information along the network .",
    "hence , the selected edge is connecting two nodes whose ability to exchange information is already very low , and we do not expect the total communicability to suffer too much from this edge removal .",
    "this observation also suggests that such downdates can be repeatedly applied without the need to recompute the ranking of the edges after each downdate .",
    "as long as the number of downdates performed remains small compared to the total number of edges , we expect good results at a greatly reduced total cost .",
    "note also that such downdates can be performed simultaneously rather than sequentially .",
    "we will refer to these variants as subgraph.no , nodetc.no , and eigenvector.no .",
    "finally , we consider a technique motivated by the bounds obtained via quadrature rules derived in section [ sec : bounds ] . from the expression for the function @xmath94 in the special case of the downdate ( cf .",
    "corollary [ dwdt ] ) , we infer that a potentially good choice may be to remove the edge having incident nodes @xmath137 for which the sum @xmath138 is minimal , if its removal does not disconnect the network .",
    "indeed , this choice reduces the upper bound only slightly and the total communicability may mirror this behavior .",
    "another way to justify this strategy is to observe that it is indeed the optimal strategy if we approximate @xmath3 with its second - order approximation @xmath139 in the definition of total communicability .",
    "this technique will be henceforth referred to as degree .",
    "we note that a related measure , namely , the average of the out - degrees @xmath140 , was proposed in @xcite as a measure for the centrality of an edge @xmath0 in directed graphs .",
    "most real world networks are characterized by low average degree . as a consequence ,",
    "the adjacency matrices of such networks are sparse ( @xmath141 ) . for the purpose of selecting a virtual edge",
    "to be updated , this implies that we have approximately @xmath142 possible choices if we want to avoid the formation of multiple edges or self  loops ( here @xmath143 is a moderate constant ) .",
    "each one of these possible updates will result in an increase of the total communicability of the network , but not every one of these will result in a significant increment .",
    "one natural updating technique is to connect two nodes having high centralities , i.e. , add the virtual edge having the highest ranking according to the corresponding edge centrality .",
    "its incident nodes , being quite central , can be expected to have an important role in the spreading of information along the network ; on the other hand , the communication between them may be relatively poor ( think for example of the case where the two nodes sit in two distinct communities ) .",
    "hence , giving them a preferential communication channel , such as an edge between them , should result in a better spread of information along the whole network .",
    "again , we will use the labels subgraph , nodetc , and eigenvector to describe these updating strategies . as before , in order to reduce the computational cost , we also test the effectiveness of these techniques without the recomputation of the ranking of the virtual edges after each update . these variants ( referred to as subgraph.no , nodetc.no , and eigenvector.no )",
    "are expected to return good results as well , since the selected update should not radically change the ranking of the edges .",
    "indeed , they make central nodes even more central , and the ranking of the edges remains consequently almost unchanged .",
    "note again that these updates can be performed simultaneously rather than sequentially .",
    "as for the case of downdating , the bounds via quadrature rules derived in section [ sec : bounds ] suggest an updating technique , i.e. , adding the virtual edge @xmath0 for which @xmath138 is maximal .",
    "indeed , such a choice would maximize the lower bound on the total communicability , see corollary [ updt ] .",
    "again , this choice can also be justified by noting that it is optimal if @xmath3 is replaced by its quadratic maclaurin approximant .",
    "we will again use the label degree to refer to this updating strategy .",
    "all these techniques will be compared with the optimal one , based on systematically trying all feasible virtual edges and selecting at each step the one resulting in the largest increase of the total communicability . due to the very high cost of this brute force approach",
    ", we will use it only on small networks .",
    "the real - world networks used in the tests ( see table [ a.tab:datasets ] ) come from a variety of sources .",
    "the zachary karate club network is a classic example in social network analysis @xcite .",
    "the sawmill and social3 networks were provided to us by prof .",
    "ernesto estrada .",
    "the sawmill network describes a communication network within a small enterprise ( see @xcite ) , whereas social3 is a network of social contacts among college students participating in a leadership course ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the network dolphins ( see @xcite ) is in the newman group from the florida sparse matrix collection @xcite and represents a social network of frequent associations between 62 dolphins in a community living in the waters off new zealand .",
    "table [ a.tab:datasets ] reports the number of nodes ( @xmath7 ) , the number of edges ( @xmath9 ) , the two largest eigenvalues , and the spectral gap .",
    "we use these networks to test all the greedy methods described in the accompanying paper .",
    "we begin by showing results for the four smallest networks .",
    "figure [ fig : down ] displays the results obtained with the downdating methods optimal , eigenvector , nodetc , subgraph , and degree .",
    "the results for eigenvector.no , subgraph.no , and nodetc.no are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained with eigenvector , subgraph and nodetc and are therefore not shown . at each step",
    "we modify the network by downdating an edge and we then compute and plot the new value of the normalized total communicability .",
    "the tests consist of 25 modifications .",
    "figure [ fig : down ] shows that our methods all perform similarly and give results that are in most cases very close to those obtained with optimal , and occasionally even better , as is the case for eigenvector ( and eigenvector.no ) on the dolphins network after a sufficient number of downdates have been performed .",
    "this result may seem puzzling at first , however , it can be easily explained by noticing that eigenvector selects a different edge from that selected by optimal at the third downdate step .",
    "hence , from that point on the adjacency matrices on which the methods work are different , and the choice performed by the optimal method may no longer be optimal for the graph manipulated by eigenvector . note that even the simple heuristic degree seems to perform well , except perhaps on the dolphins network after 15 or so downdate steps .",
    "overall , the methods based on eigenvector and total communicability centrality appear to perform best in view of their efficacy and low cost .",
    "the results for the updating methods are reported in figure [ fig : up ] . as for the downdating methods , subgraph.no , eigenvector.no , and nodetc.no return results that are virtually identical to those obtained using subgraph , eigenvector and nodetc , therefore we omit them from the figure .",
    "once again we see that the methods based on eigenvector , subgraph , and total communicability centrality give excellent results , whereas degree is generally not as effective .",
    "rewiring results are displayed in figure [ fig : rew ] .",
    "clearly , the methods making use of edge centrality perform quite well , in contrast to random rewiring ( which is only included as a base for comparison ) .",
    "note also the poor performance of node , showing that the use of edge centralities ( as opposed to node centralities alone ) is indispensable in this context .",
    "the values obtained using the updates are in general higher than those obtained using the rewiring strategies , since updating implies the addition of edges whereas in rewiring the number of edges remains the same .",
    "for these methods the effects of downdates have a great impact , leading to a decrease by up to nearly @xmath144 of the original value of the total communicability after 25 downdates ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : down ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the methods based on the edge eigenvector and total communicability centrality appear to be more stable than the others under rewiring and to dampen the effect of the downdates even for small networks .",
    "this section provides pseudocodes for all the algorithms used in the accompanying paper .",
    "algorithms [ alg : down.check ] and [ alg : down.no ] implement our downdating techniques with or without the connectivity check , while algorithm [ alg : up ] implements our updating heuristics .",
    "all these three algorithms can be used with or without the recomputation of the rankings for the edges after each modification has been performed .",
    "they require as inputs the initial graph @xmath16 ( typically in the form of its adjacency matrix @xmath2 ) and a budget @xmath64 , i.e. , the number of modifications one wants to perform .",
    "the boolean @xmath145 indicates whether the rankings of the edges have to be recomputed after each modification ( @xmath146 ) or not ( @xmath147 ) .    for the updating algorithm",
    ", it is also required to give in input a subset @xmath148 of nodes .",
    "the @xmath64 modifications will be selected among the virtual edges in the subgraph containing the nodes in @xmath149 and the corresponding edges .",
    "finally , algorithm [ alg : chan ] contains a detailed description of the technique introduced in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm requires as input the adjacency matrix @xmath2 and a budget @xmath64 , as our methods do .",
    "moreover , this methods requires as input an integer @xmath150 , which is the number of leading eigenpairs to be considered and updated during the search for the @xmath64 modifications .                          consider a network in which every edge is weighted by a parameter @xmath156 and consider its adjacency matrix @xmath157 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this new matrix are @xmath158 for all @xmath159 and its estrada index becomes @xmath160 , where tr denotes the trace .",
    "this index can be interpreted as the _ partition function _ of the corresponding complex network : @xmath161 form the standpoint of quantum statistical mechanics , @xmath162 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath163 is the inverse temperature , with @xmath164 the boltzmann constant and @xmath165 the absolute temperature .",
    "it is well known @xcite that @xmath96 can be understood as a measure of the `` strength '' of the interactions between pairs of vertices ; the higher the temperature ( i.e. , the lower the value of @xmath96 ) , the weaker the interactions .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath29 ( for @xmath166 ) give the possible energy levels , each corresponding to a different state of the system .",
    "the probability that the system is found in a particular state can be obtained by considering the maxwell  boltzmann distribution : @xmath167 using this notation and the fact that the estrada index can be seen as the partition function of the system , in @xcite the authors define the _ gibbs entropy _ of the network as @xmath168 where in the last equality we have used the fact that @xmath169 .",
    "using now the standard relation @xmath170 that relates the _ helmholtz free energy _",
    "@xmath171 , the _ total energy _ of the network @xmath172 , the gibbs entropy @xmath149 , and the absolute temperature of the system @xmath165 , the authors derive : @xmath173 it is then clear that if we set @xmath174 and let @xmath175 , we then get @xmath176 ."
