    ".total 244 and @xmath0 fluxes .",
    "distances are as reported in condon et al . ( 1991 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : models ]",
    "we have combined new measurements of the 244 and 610  mhz fluxes , obtained with the gmrt , of a sample of 20 lirgs and ulirgs with existing radio data .",
    "the resulting radio spectra show a range of bends and turn - overs that can be well explained in terms of free - free absorption . in several cases two radio components with different emission measures",
    "are necessary to fit the data .    for those objects with two emission components ,",
    "we estimate the fraction of radio emission associated with each . via a simple model for the temporal evolution of the supernova rate",
    ", we estimate the fraction of supernovae occurring inside and outside of their parent hii regions as a function of hii region lifetime . for simple exponentially decreasing star formation rates the lifetimes so derived are too long for them to refer to single hii regions . altering the form of the high mass end of the imf or the metallicity has relatively little affect on this result . however , if the star formation rate for these sources is currently rising , rather than declining , the derived hii region lifetimes are very much reduced .",
    "the effect of a rising star formation rate is to increase the number of younger ( high mass ) supernovae occurring within hii regions , relative to the number of older ( lower mass ) supernovae occurring outside hii regions .",
    "the star formation rate rise times should be much less than the lifetime of the least massive stars that produce type ii supernovae . despite this reduction ,",
    "the derived ages remain longer than those plausible for individual hii regions .",
    "such large ages imply that the physical situation is one in which younger hii regions obscure older star formation regions along the line of sight . this situation would arise naturally if star formation propagated outwards during a burst .",
    "because a rising star formation rate creates conditions more conducive to free - free absorption , and the fact that the number of sources with two emission components is close to 50% , it is likely that those in which only a single emission component is present are those with falling star formation rates .",
    "the existence of two emission components in the radio therefore points to an age - dependent extinction analogous to that seen at other wavelengths . in the case of radio emission , the most massive stars ,",
    "that end their lives earlier , produce synchrotron emission that is subjected to preferentially more free - free absorption than those , lower mass , stars that live for longer .",
    "the observed over - prediction of fluxes at frequencies above @xmath3 may be resolved if the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum were not straight , but had a steeper spectral index at higher frequencies due to ionization losses , as modeled by thompson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the two radio components in ugc  8058 can be identified with the radio loud agn and star formation ; the former contributing 66% of the radio emission .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the model of vega et al .",

    "<S> we describe radio observations at 244 and @xmath0 of a sample of 20 luminous and ultra - luminous iras galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these are a sub - set of a sample of 31 objects that have well - measured radio spectra up to at least @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio spectra of these objects below @xmath2 show a great variety of forms and are rarely a simple power - law extrapolation of the synchrotron spectra at higher frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> most objects of this class have spectral turn - overs or bends in their radio spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these spectra in terms of free - free absorption in the starburst environment .    </S>",
    "<S> several objects show radio spectra with two components having free - free turn - overs at different frequencies ( including arp  220 and arp  299 ) , indicating that synchrotron emission originates from regions with very different emission measures . in these sources , using a simple model for the supernova rate , we estimate the time for which synchrotron emission is subject to strong free - free absorption by ionized gas , and compare this to expected hii region lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ionized gas lifetimes are an order of magnitude larger than plausible lifetimes for individual hii regions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this result and argue that those sources which have a significant radio component with strong free - free absorption are those in which the star formation rate is still increasing with time .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that if ionization losses modify the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum so that it steepens toward higher frequencies , the often observed deficit in fluxes higher than @xmath3 would be much reduced .    </S>",
