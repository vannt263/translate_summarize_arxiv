    "pedersen et al_.

    "the corresponding descent of the il scatter is similar to that described by _ dhillon and robinson _ [ 2005 ] and _ ashrafi et al_. [ 2006 ] .",
    "a sudden brightening of aa and increased speed of descent of the artificial plasma ` layer ' ( patch ) in the hf - beam center occurs near 180 km , while its peak plasma frequency @xmath26 reaches @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the optical data shows [ p10 ] that this patch is fairly uniform near @xmath27180 km but then becomes a @xmath2720-km * *  * * collection of * *  * * ( @xmath28**b**@xmath29 ) filaments a few km in diameter . while the degree of inhomogeneity of the descending patch increases , its speed , @xmath300.3 km / s , appears to be constant until @xmath31160 km .",
    "then , the artificial plasma slows down , staying near the terminal altitude @xmath32150 km before the emissions retreat in altitude near the end of 4-min injection pulse . during a continuous ` on ' period , the artificial plasma near @xmath33 was quenched several times , initiating the process over again from higher altitudes .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the descending feature at @xmath34180 km where @xmath35 or @xmath36 . enhanced 427.8-nm emissions indicate the presence of electrons with energies @xmath3718.7 ev , exceeding the ionization energies of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",

    "the presence of il and bright green - line emissions indicate that plasma turbulence is still excited and efficiently accelerates electrons above 4 ev .",
    "however , the blue - line emissions almost vanish [ p10 ] , thereby indicating only few accelerated electrons at @xmath202 . that this is in no way contradictory follows from the fact that inelastic losses increase tenfold between 10 and 20 ev .",

    "the fact that the artificial plasma stays near @xmath33 indicates that ionization is balanced by recombination or @xmath210 , which at @xmath211 corresponds to @xmath21230 ev ( figure  [ gion ] ) .",
    "a mechanism for generating km - sized filaments below 180 km could be the thermal self - focusing instability ( sfi ) near @xmath49 , resulting in a broad spectrum of plasma irregularity scale sizes [ e.g. , _ guzdar et al_. , 1998 ] .",
    "significantly , @xmath27km - scale plasma irregularities grow initially but within 10s of seconds thermal self - focusing leads to smaller ( 10s to 100s meters ) scale sizes . during descent ,",
    "the critical altitude moves downward by several km within 10 s , thereby precluding further development of sfi , while the @xmath27km - scale irregularities have sufficient time to develop .",
    "when the descent rate drops , small - scale irregularities can fully develop and scatter the hf beam , thereby impeding the development of otsi / pdi@xmath213 and hence ionization .",
    "as soon as the artificial plasma decays , sfi falls away and hence irregularities gradually disappear .",
    "then , the artificial plasma can be created again .",
    "this explains why the artificial layer ceases and then reappears ( figure  [ layer ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the artificial plasma sustaining interaction with the transmitted hf beam can be created via enhanced ionization by suprathermal electrons accelerated by langmuir turbulence near the critical altitude .",
    "as soon as the interaction region is ionized , it shifts toward the upward - propagating hf beam , thereby creating an ionizing wavefront , which resembles _ pedersen et al_. s [ 2010 ] descending artificial ionospheric layers .",
