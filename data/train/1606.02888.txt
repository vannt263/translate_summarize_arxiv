    "non - leptonic two - body decays of bottom mesons and baryons are interesting for phenomenological studies of the quark flavour sector of the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "they yield observables like branching ratios and cp asymmetries that are relevant for studying the ckm mechanism of quark flavour mixing and allow access to the quantities of the unitarity triangle ( cf .  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "oscillations and decays of @xmath10-mesons received considerable attention for the first time in the 1980s and 90s when the experiments argus at desy and cleo at cornell started to collect a lot of statistics . in the last decade ,",
    "non - leptonic two - body @xmath11-decays have been extensively measured at the asymmetric @xmath12 colliders ( @xmath10-factories ) at slac and kek , but also in hadronic environments such as the tevatron , and the results obtained by the babar , belle , d0 and cdf collaborations have reached a high level of precision ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "the lhcb experiment at the lhc at cern has become the main player as far as experimental physics of the bottom quark is concerned . a large data set on bottom mesons and baryons has been accumulated , and results related to non - leptonic decays have been published ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and further analyses are ongoing . in the near future",
    "also belle  ii will contribute significantly to further improve the measurements  @xcite .    with the plethora of precise experimental data on non - leptonic decays at hand , theoretical predictions at the same level of accuracy",
    "are very much desired . however , the theoretical description of non - leptonic two - body @xmath11 decays is notoriously complicated . a straightforward computation of the hadronic matrix elements which describe the weak transition is not feasible due to the presence of the strong interaction in the purely hadronic initial and final states .",
    "this circumstance entails qcd effects from many different scales which are , moreover , largely separated . in a first approach , known as nave factorization",
    ", the hadronic transition matrix elements were factorized into a product of a form factor and a decay constant  @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies built on flavour symmetries of the light quarks  @xcite and on factorization frameworks such as perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite and qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite , to mention the most prominent ones .",
    "certain combinations of these approaches can also be found ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the present work",
    "we adopt the qcdf framework and consider non - leptonic heavy - to - heavy transitions , which at the quark - level are mediated by the weak decay @xmath13 , where we treat the bottom and the charm quark as massive and the light quarks as massless . performing an expansion of the amplitude in powers of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the typical hadronic scale , a systematic separation of qcd effects from different scales can be achieved and corrections to nave factorization be systematically included . taking the decay @xmath16 as an example , the transition amplitude in the heavy - mass limit",
    "is then given by  @xcite @xmath17 where the local four - fermion operators @xmath18 describe the underlying weak decay .",
    "the @xmath19 form factors and the light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) @xmath20 of the light meson contain long - distance effects and can be obtained from non - perturbative methods like qcd sum rules and lattice qcd .",
    "the hard - scattering kernels @xmath21 , on the other hand , only receive contributions from scales of @xmath22 and are accessible in a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling @xmath23 . after the convolution over the momentum fraction @xmath24 of the valence quark inside the light meson",
    ", they yield a perturbative contribution to the topological tree amplitude @xmath25 . taking the decay @xmath26 as a specific example",
    ", the latter is defined via  @xcite @xmath27    the leading - power hard - scattering kernels have been known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy for more than a decade for both heavy - to - light  @xcite and heavy - to - heavy  @xcite decays . in the latter case ,",
    "expanding the lcda in gegenbauer moments up to the first moment @xmath28 , the topological tree amplitude @xmath29 to nlo reads  @xcite @xmath30 for the light meson being @xmath31 or @xmath32 we have @xmath33 and for the kaon @xmath34 is assumed  @xcite . with this mild dependence on the light meson lcda",
    "we encounter a quasi - universal value @xmath35 for heavy - to - heavy decays in qcdf to nlo accuracy .",
    "a quasi - universality was also found upon extracting @xmath29 from experimental data  @xcite . however , the favoured central value @xmath36 for the decays @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , with errors in the individual channels at the @xmath40    @xmath41% level , is considerably lower .    in recent years",
    "next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to heavy - to - light decays have become available  @xcite , and besides the prospects of increasing precision on the experimental side , there is multiple motivation to go beyond nlo in heavy - to - heavy transitions as well : first , the nlo correction is small since it is proportional to a small wilson coefficient and , in addition , is colour - suppressed . at nnlo",
    "the colour suppression gets lifted and the large wilson coefficient re - enters , and therefore the nnlo correction could be comparable in size to the nlo term . moreover , it is interesting to see whether the quasi - universality of @xmath29 persists at nnlo . at leading power",
    "the decays @xmath42 receive only vertex corrections to the colour - allowed tree topology .",
    "interactions with the spectator quark as well as the weak annihilation topology are power - suppressed  @xcite and there are neither contributions from penguin operators nor is there a colour - suppressed tree topology .",
    "therefore , a precise knowledge of the colour - allowed tree amplitude @xmath29 allows to reliably estimate the size of power corrections to eq .   by comparison to experimental data , and at the same time provides a test of the qcdf framework .",
    "this requires that the perturbative expansion of the hard scattering kernel is under control , and that also the uncertainties of the non - perturbative input parameters ( form factors , decay constants , lcdas ) can be minimized . in the present work",
    "we therefore calculate the two - loop vertex correction to the leading - power hard scattering kernels in the framework of qcdf .",
    "parts of the computational procedure were already presented in  @xcite . here , we give the full result of the technically challenging two - loop calculation .",
    "besides , we present an updated phenomenological analysis of @xmath43 decays , with a light meson from the set @xmath44 for both , the meson @xmath45 and the colour - allowed tree amplitude @xmath25 .",

    "data on @xmath47 with @xmath2 being @xmath31 or @xmath39  @xcite and on baryonic form factors have become available  @xcite .",

    "while the @xmath46 baryons are not produced at an @xmath547 @xmath10-factory , they account for about @xmath548 of the @xmath49-hadrons produced at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the number of @xmath46 baryons produced is comparable to the number of @xmath549 or @xmath550 mesons , and is significantly higher than the number of @xmath541 mesons . due to the half - integer - spin of @xmath46 ,",

    "it might be worth noting that we evaluated all master integrals analytically  @xcite in a so - called canonical basis  @xcite , a result which catalyzed the convolution with the lcda and enabled us to obtain the convoluted kernels almost completely analytically .",
    "the nnlo contributions yield a positive shift to the colour - allowed tree amplitude @xmath29 , which is sizable for its imaginary part , but small for its real part and its magnitude .",

    "we performed our analysis using the pole scheme for the heavy - quark masses . a change to the @xmath48 scheme does not show any significant shift of the amplitude within the range of physical values for the heavy - quark masses .",

    "we find that for @xmath593 decays the central values of the theoretical predictions are in general higher compared to the experimental values . within the given uncertainties",
    "the quantities agree at the 2    3@xmath449 level for @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the final state , and slightly better for @xmath39 and @xmath594 .",
    "compared to the analysis at nlo  @xcite , our increased values for the form factors and the amplitude , together with decreased experimental values , have shifted theory and experiment further apart . for @xmath595 decays ,",

    "for the baryonic decays , on the other hand , the predicted branching fractions turn out to be @xmath596 smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the reason for this difference in the @xmath593 and the @xmath46 decays .",
    "we therefore propose a systematic analysis of factorization for @xmath46 decays in the future .",
    "moreover , we analyzed ratios of non - leptonic and semi - leptonic decay rates in order to further probe the factorization theorem to nnlo . the ratios of different non - leptonic rates turn out to be in good agreement , comparing theoretical prediction and experiment . in the case of non - leptonic to semi - leptonic ratios , on the other hand , the values for @xmath597 that we extract from experiment are lower by 2  ",
