    "recent studies of the dense molecular gas in five star - forming regions of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) revealed a number of striking differences with respect to properties typically observed in the clouds of the galactic disk ( see johansson  1994 ; chin  1997 ) :  is underabundant relative to , the /  ratio ( @xmath4 2 ) appears to be smaller than the canonical value of 3.5 in the galactic interstellar medium , and  to hcn line intensity ratios are larger than those in the milky way . in view of these results",
    ", one may expect that a thorough study of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) with its low metallicity and strong uv radiation field will reveal even more drastic deviations from typical galactic disk properties , thus permitting insights into otherwise not directly discernible astrophysical and astrochemical processes ( cf .",

    "a high sensitivity study of lirs36 is presented , providing a detailed molecular view of a star formation region in the extremely metal poor environment (  westerlund 1990 ) that characterizes the smc .",
    "the data were taken in january 1996 and 1997 and in july 1997 , using the 15-m swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) at la silla , chile .",
    "two sis receivers , one at @xmath18 = 3 mm and one at 2 mm , yielded overall system temperatures , including sky noise , of order  = 250k on a main beam brightness temperature ( ) scale while for ( 1 - 0 )  reached 400k . in january 1997 , a @xmath18 = 1.3 mm sis receiver yielded overall  system temperatures of 500  1600k at 218  245 ghz and 3000  4000k at 265  267ghz in clear but humid weather . in july 1997 , a 0.85 mm sis receiver with  @xmath4 3000k was employed .",

    "all 2000 channels were used to cover a similar velocity range .",
    "the channel separation of 43khz corresponds to 0.04 , 0.05  0.06 , 0.08  0.10 and 0.11  0.15  for the frequency intervals 340  350 , 265  220 , 150  130 and 115  85ghz , respectively . depending on line frequency",

    "the column density is derived in the same way as for hcn ( see footnote f ) .",
    "different densities and temperatures were chosen to account for  depletion at highest densities and for the suspected large spatial extent of the  emission region (  chin  1997 ) .",
    "hcn is suspected to emit mainly from the coolest and densest parts of the cloud ( cf .",
    "johansson  1994 ; chin  1997 ) , so that  = 20k and  = 10@xmath28  are appropriate .",
    "the column density was derived with an lvg code ( see also footnote b ) .",
    "the hcn ( 32 ) upper limit ( table[tbl : lirs36 ] ) is not small enough to provide a stringent density limit .",
    "the column density is derived in the same way as for hcn ( see footnote f ) . since [ hcn]/[hnc ] abundance ratios tend to drop with rising density ( schilke  1992 ) ,  = 10@xmath29  is justified .",
    "the column density was derived from an lvg simulation with @xmath15=32 line intensities being slightly weaker ( by @xmath4 30% ) than the 21 lines ( see also sect.[sec : mc3-cs ] ) .",
    "having estimated the molecular densities in sects.[sec : mc3-x - factor ] , [ sec : mc3 - 13co ] , and [ sec : mc3-cs ] and having a quantitative idea of the kinetic temperature distribution ( lequeux  1994 ) , we can now also determine the column densities for various molecular species .",
    "both temperature and density vary inside the cloud and each molecule and transition is tracing gas at different temperature and density ; error limits are thus difficult to assess .",
    "nevertheless , our data allow a rough estimate of molecular abundances in the optically thin limit .",
    "this is the appropriate approach , firstly because we do not know the optical depth of most lines and secondly because johansson  ( 1994 ) find , hcn , and cs to be ( almost ) optically thin in their mm - wave transitions toward the prominent lmc star - forming region n159",
    ". assumed kinetic temperatures , densities , and resulting absolute and fractional ( relative to ) column densities for a @xmath4 50  ( 15pc ) beam size are given in table[tb2:lirs36 ] .",
    "a comparison with galactic disk values directly shows that the lirs36 fractional abundances , [ x]/ [ ] , are much smaller (  blake  1987 ) : for co , cs , , and , underabundances relative to the orion extended ridge or to the prototypical dark cloud tmc-1 are @xmath4 10 . for hcn and hnc and probably for cn",
    "as well , underabundances reach two orders of magnitude and are thus even surpassing those reported by johansson ( 1997 ) for the lmc star - forming region n159 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that cn is not enhanced relative to hcn and hnc as observed in galactic disk photodissociation regions with high uv fluxes ( fuente  1993 ; greaves & church 1996 ) .",
    "we may suspect that the low lirs36 fractional abundances of hcn , hnc , and cn are related to a small nitrogen abundance . with average values of [ n / h ] = @xmath231.1 and [ c / h ] = @xmath231.3 in star - forming regions of the smc ( westerlund 1990 ) ,",
    "however , nitrogen is not the most depleted among the cno elements .",
    "it thus remains to be seen whether the hcn , hnc , and cn fractional abundances are related to an exceptionally small nitrogen abundance in lirs36 or whether they are caused by a chemical process that is found in other molecular smc cores as well .",
    "we have used the models described by chin  ( 1997 ) to investigate the chemical evolution of lirs36 using elemental abundances of c , n , and o from the s2 model of millar & herbst ( 1990 ) . because observed emission clearly arises in regions having different densities and",
    "because we have no information on the density profile within the molecular cloud nor on the the size of the high density cs clump , we have considered a simple constant density model with densities in the range  = @xmath30  and  = 20k . for comparison , we have also calculated a ` galactic ' model ( model ` g ' of millar & herbst 1990 ) for  = @xmath25  ( fig.[fig : millar - model ] ) .",
    "in addition to a lower metallicity , the smc models have a smaller dust - to - gas ratio , and hence h@xmath2 formation rate , by a ratio of 6.5 and a uv intensity larger by a factor of 4 , compared to galactic values .",
    "there are conflicting results on the appropriate cosmic - ray ionisation rate .",
    "chi & wolfendale ( 1993 ) have argued that , based on gamma - ray observations , the rate in the smc is at most 11% of the galactic value .",
    "however , observations of  in the lmc and smc ( chin  1997 ) indicate that the rate is larger than that implied by chi & wolfendale . in these models",
    "we use a rate of @xmath31s@xmath6 , three times larger than the galactic value .",
    "the main impact of this rate is to increase the ionisation fraction and to reduce the chemical time - scales .",
    "finally , we have used a visual extinction of 10 mag . in calculating photorates . while this is obviously too large for the molecular envelope of lirs36 , the central region , in which densities greater than @xmath32 are derived from cs , could easily have an extinction large enough to exclude photoeffects even with a low dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the results of our four model calculations are summarised in fig.[fig : millar - model ] and indicate that the abundance of cn is sensitive to the o@xmath2 abundance since this species destroys cn with a fast , measured rate coefficient of @xmath33 ( /300k)@xmath34@xmath35s@xmath6 down to 20k ( sims  1994 ) . the fractional abundance of o@xmath2 increases as one goes from the galactic to the smc model at  = @xmath25 and as density increases because of the decreasing abundance of c atoms which destroy o@xmath2 . in model s2",
    "there is more free oxygen remaining after all available carbon has been tied up in co so that the importance of the destruction of cn by o@xmath2 increases .",
    "note that the @xmath36 ratio , where @xmath37 represents the elemental abundance of species @xmath0 , varies between 2.4 ( model g ) and 10.5 ( model s2 ) while the difference between the elemental abundances of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is @xmath40 ( model g ) and @xmath41 ( model s2 ) , and the ratio ( @xmath42 , increases from 1.4 ( model g ) to 10.4 ( model s2 ) .",
    "these values show that in model s2 there is a lot of oxygen remaining after all the carbon has been processed into co and thus the importance of cn destruction by o@xmath2 is more important in the smc models .",
    "the fractional abundance of cn decreases by about a factor of 3 as one goes from model g to s2 and by a further factor of 100 as the density increases from @xmath25 to @xmath43 . as a result ,",
    "the abundance of cn becomes less than or comparable with those of hcn and hnc at high density . on the other hand ,",
    "cs is not destroyed by o@xmath2 or o atoms and its abundance changes by less than a factor of two over all the models investigated .",
    "note that the maximum fractional abundance of cn at 10@xmath44 is only @xmath45 for chemical timescales",
    "@xmath24 @xmath32yrs ; for longer times , the abundance falls rapidly to its steady - state value of @xmath46 .",
    "having made a mm - wave molecular survey of the lirs36 star - forming region in the smc , we obtain the following main results :    1 .",
    "we have detected co , cs , so , , , hcn , hnc , , and .",
    "no , , and , surprisingly , cn were not detected . among the rare isotopic species , we have seen  and tentatively c@xmath47s , but not .",
    "2 .   for a characteristical scale length of @xmath4 10pc and assuming virial equilibrium ,",
    "the @xmath0 = @xmath1()/@xmath3 conversion factor is with @xmath4 @xmath48()@xmath6 a factor of two larger than the local galactic disk @xmath0-factor .",
    "smc @xmath0-factors given by rubio  ( 1993a ) for this scale length may have to be reduced by half an order of magnitude .",
    "3 .   density estimates range from  @xmath4 100  ( deduced from the virial masss and the spatial extent of the co emission ) over @xmath25  ( from ) to @xmath32  @xmath49  ( from cs ) .",
    "the observed cs transitions provide strong evidence for the presence of a very dense core with a density likely surpassing @xmath43 .",
    "4 .   as in the lmc cloud cores , the @xmath9()/@xmath9 ( ) line intensity ratio is larger than the usual values encountered in the galactic disk . whether this is caused by isotopic abundance anomalies , by isotope selective photodissociation , or by chemical",
    "fractionation remains an open question .",
    "@xmath9()/@xmath9(hcn ) and @xmath9(hcn)/@xmath9(hnc ) line intensity ratios are @xmath14 1 , consistent with molecular emission from a warm (  @xmath14 10k ) molecular environment exposed to a high ionizing flux .",
    "fractional ( relative ) abundances of co , cs , , and are an order of magnitude below those of the galactic disk .",
    "hcn , hnc , and likely also cn are even underabundant by two orders of magnitude . whether this is reflecting a particularly small nitrogen abundance in lirs36 or whether this is a common chemical peculiarity of other smc cores as well remains open .",
    "the non - detection of cn can be explained in terms of the high cloud density and a ( relatively ) high fractional abundance of o@xmath2 that is destroying cn but not cs .",
