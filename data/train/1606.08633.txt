    "thermodynamics , a cornerstone of modern physics , only applies to macroscopic systems .",
    "as the dimensions of the system under consideration shrink down to the atomic scale , one has to account for the increasing role played by fluctuations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as microscopic systems obey the laws of quantum mechanics , quantum effects are expected to play an increasingly important role . whereas it has long being theoretically established that quantum computation and cryptography can outperform their classical counterparts @xcite , the question whether quantum mechanics is a true game changer in the thermodynamics arena stands as an open one in the field . answering this question in the affirmative may have a tremendous impact in the way we efficiently generate , store , and distribute energy",
    "there are strong indications that fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis can be explained only by quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , high efficient energy transport seems to need quantum coherent and non - markovian dynamics @xcite .",
    "another significant example comes from the study of quantum heat engines @xcite : quantum coherence can not be exploited to beat the carnot efficiency in extracting energy from thermal baths , yet it does make it possible to boost the power output @xcite .    in order to study the thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of quantum systems , one",
    "is first required to find suitable extensions of the concept of mechanical work .",
    "the latter is customarily defined as the integral of the force applied by an external agent times the displacement of the system . applying this definition to the quantum domain presents some challenges , even when restricting one s attention to closed systems .",
    "since work can not be represented by a hermitian operator @xcite , it is not an observable in the standard quantum mechanical sense .",
    "therefore , in order to define work one has to also specify a suitable scheme to measure it @xcite . a favored choice in the literature is based on a double projective measurement of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "based on this definition , one recovers a quantum - mechanical version of the fluctuation relations originally derived in the framework of classical stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "these relations , which describe quantum evolution starting from a thermal state , were recently tested in experiments @xcite .",
    "still , one may speculate whether initial coherences  and quantum interference in general  play any role in determining the statistics of work .",
    "this question clearly can not be addressed by a double projective measurement , as the first measurement would erase any initial coherence in the energy eigenbasis and thereby rule out the possibility that `` interfering alternatives '' @xcite leave a trace in the work distribution .    here",
    "we consider a measurement setup for the work distribution , based on dispersive coupling to a quantum detector at the beginning and at the end of the evolution .",
    "we discuss two measurement schemes  denoted `` a '' and `` b '' in the following  that differ for the initial state of the detector as well as for the choice of the final measurement .",
    "scheme a naturally leads to the definition of a quasiprobability distribution for the work , whose negativity is due to quantum coherence of the initial state and quantum interference effects @xcite . in scheme b , quantum interference effects still appear , but only as the result of an incomplete measurement . finally , we put forward a realization of our setup in a circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit - qed ) architecture @xcite , using a transmon qubit as the system and a quantized cavity mode as the detector .",
    "our proposed realization , which we claim to be within reach of state - of - the - art superconducting circuit technology , also illustrates the use of a single bosonic mode to probe both classical and nonclassical features of the work distribution by by preparing the mode either in a classical or in a nonclassical state .",
    "while unifying and extending previous work , our approach highlights two complementary aspects of the work distribution that can be unveiled one at a time , but not simultaneously , in according to general principles of quantum mechanics . on one hand ,",
    "our scheme a is similar in spirit to the interferometric schemes described in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the idea of directly extracting the work distribution out of a single measurement ( as done here in scheme b ) can already be found in @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that the effect of initial coherences was not considered in these works .",
    "finally , in @xcite the authors consider direct measurements of variable strength on generic initial states and reach similar results as we do for scheme b. however , they do not consider the possibility of directly extracting the moments of the work distribution using scheme a. this leads to the impossibility to measure higher - order moments ( starting from the second one ) in extremely weak coupling conditions .",
    "we consider a closed quantum system driven by an external , classical field , so that the system dynamics is described by a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in the distribution of work @xmath1 done by the external field between times @xmath2 and @xmath3 , or , equivalently , in the corresponding variation @xmath4 in the internal energy of the system . to determine this variation , we couple the system to a quantum detector , namely , a free particle characterized by the conjugate position @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 operators .",
    "we assume that the particle has a large enough mass that its kinetic energy can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the system and the detector is described by hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "as @xmath8 commutes with @xmath9 at all times , the coupling to the detector does not induce transitions between the system eigenstates .",
    "the time - dependent coupling strength @xmath10 is chosen so that the detector `` records '' the energy of the system at the beginning and at the end of the evolution : @xmath11 $ ] , where the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constant parameters with the dimension of time and momentum , respectively .",
    "the meaning of the delta functions in the expression for @xmath10 is that the coupling takes place over a time scale that is fast compared to the variation of @xmath0 , so that the dynamics of the system is effectively `` frozen '' while the detector is coupled .",
    "neither the system nor the detector are projectively measured between times @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the full evolution is described by the operator @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the evolution operator of the system alone and we have set @xmath18 .",
    "we reasonably assume that the system and the detector are initially in a separable state and that the detector is prepared in a pure state .",
    "then the initial state is described by the density matrix @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the initial density matrix of the system and @xmath21 is the detector wavefunction in momentum space .",
    "we denote with @xmath22 the @xmath23-th eigenstate of @xmath0 and with @xmath24 its corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the final state of the detector is described by the following density matrix , written either in the momentum basis , @xmath25 , or in the position basis , @xmath26 :    @xmath27    [ eq : rho_d_p ]    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the fourier transform of @xmath21 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .    equations are a good starting point to discuss different measurement schemes , as we have not yet specified the initial state of the detector , nor the measurement to be performed at the end .",
    "first of all , we notice that the detector momentum @xmath6 is a conserved quantity of the evolution . as a result",
    ", the coupling between the system and the detector can not induce transitions between different eigenstates of the momentum ; instead , it changes their relative phase .",
    "this picture is obviously reversed when considering eigenstates of the position , as the system - detector coupling @xmath33 induces transition between eigenstates of the position operator @xmath5 .",
    "based on these considerations , one can envisage the following two schemes to measure the work distribution :    * prepare the detector in a superposition of momentum eigenstates and measure their relative phase at the end of the evolution . *",
    "prepare the detector in a position eigenstate and make a position measurement .    before discussing each scheme in more detail",
    ", we observe that scheme b is a variation of the standard von neumann measurement scheme @xcite , while scheme a is clearly reminiscent of the full - counting statistics formalism @xcite .",
    "we first consider scheme a and focus on the phase accumulated between the momentum eigenstates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this phase can be measured by standard tomography and is related to the characteristic function @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic function is therefore the primary measurement outcome in scheme a. from an operational point of view , we notice that the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath12 can be retrieved by varying either the time or the strength of the system - detector coupling .",
    "once @xmath37 is known , the moments of the work distribution can be determined in the standard way as @xmath38 for a closed system ( such as the one we are considering ) , the moments take the intuitive form @xmath39 $ ] .    can the characteristic function be linked to a probability distribution for the work ?",
    "the answer is not obvious and directly points to the quantum nature of the work done on a quantum system .",
    "a distribution @xmath40 can be formally defined as the fourier transform of the characteristic function @xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "starting from , a direct calculation gives @xcite @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{eq : p(w)}\\ ] ] the diagonal contributions in , i.e. , those with @xmath43 , are always positive and can be immediately interpreted in terms of classical transitions between different eigenstates ( see the following and the supplementary material ( sm ) @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , we refer to them as `` classical contributions '' . on the contrary ,",
    "the off - diagonal contributions , i.e. , those with @xmath44 , correspond to classically forbidden exchanges of energy @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , their sign can be negative .",
    "due to the presence of these terms , @xmath40 is not definite positive and can only be referred to as a quasi - probability distribution @xcite .",
    "the negativity of @xmath40 is a signature of the `` quantumness '' of the work distribution and can be associated to the violation of a leggett - garg inequality @xcite . from the structure of eq .",
    "it is clear that the presence of initial coherence between different energy eigenstates is a necessary condition for the negativity of @xmath40 .",
    "this is in agreement with a recent interpretation of negative quasiprobabilities in the full counting statistics as arising from quantum interference effects @xcite .",
    "notice also the analogy with the full counting statistics of charge transport in superconducting circuits @xcite , with the phase coherence of the superconducting order parameter playing the role that initial - state coherences play here .",
    "the negative quasiprobability distribution we predicted for scheme a is by no means unphysical , as it does not describe the probability of a certain measurement outcome . a more direct access to the work distribution is provided by scheme b , in which we initialize the detector in a position eigenstate and measure the distribution of its final positions . as the shift in position is proportional to the energy injected in the system ,",
    "its measurement completely determines the work distribution . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_d_p ] ) , the probability to find the detector in position @xmath5 is @xmath46 if the detector is initially in a definite position state , i.e. , @xmath47 @xcite , then only the terms with @xmath48 survive in",
    ". then we can write @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the probability to find the system initially in the state @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the transition probability from state @xmath51 to state @xmath53 , as prescribed by the unitary evolution @xmath54 .",
    "this shows that the measurement outcome of scheme b can be fully interpreted in terms of classical conditional probabilities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath55 coincides with provided only the classical contributions are retained .",
    "it would so far seem that no quantum interference can be observed using scheme b. still , interference effects are to some degree recovered if the detector can not fully discriminate between quantum trajectories leading to different variations of the internal energy . in practice , this happens when the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "have a substantial overlap .",
    "then the contributions with @xmath58 , @xmath44 do not vanish and modify the resulting distribution .",
    "this fact is fully consistent with the well - known notion of incomplete ( or `` partial '' ) measurement in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "as we increase the uncertainty in the initial state , we continuously transition from a classical work distribution with well - resolved peaks to a distribution where individual peaks can not be resolved .",
    "this broadened distribution is sensitive to initial coherences , thus revealing the underlying quantum dynamics and highlighting the differences between classical and quantum uncertainty .",
    "we conclude this section by stressing one key difference between the two proposed schemes . in scheme",
    "a , the system - detector coupling does not induce any transition between eigenstates of the detector momentum , whose relative phase is eventually measured . as a result , one gains access to all the moments of the work distribution without perturbing the dynamics , regardless of the strength of the coupling . borrowing the terminology from circuit qed",
    "( see also experimental implementation below ) , we can refer to scheme a as a _ dispersive _ readout , in which the information is encoded in the phase of the detector . on the contrary , in scheme b the detector position , which is eventually measured , changes after the coupling to the system . in this case , by increasing the strength of the coupling ( or , equivalently , by decreasing the uncertainty in the detector position ) , we partially destroy the effect of initial coherences @xcite . in scheme",
    "b the perturbation introduced by the detector is unavoidable and leads to a trade - off between measurement precision and the witnessing of quantum coherence .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , in the limit of very weak coupling , the moments of the work ( except for the first one ) are undetermined because of the uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "the concepts outlined above can be readily tested in a circuit - qed architecture @xcite using a transmon qubit @xcite as the system and a quantized mode of a microwave cavity as the detector [ fig .",
    "this detection scheme is not fully equivalent to that based on a free particle , introduced in the previous section , yet it preserves all its essential features provided one identifies momentum eigenstates with fock states and position eigenstates with coherent states . as we will see , due to the reduced dimensionality of the hilbert space , the basis that describes the ( continuous ) position of our detector is overcomplete , and therefore possesses an intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the kinetic energy of the detector can not be neglected and results in an additional phase acquired by each of the fock states @xcite .",
    "we will not explicitly consider this phase as it is automatically accounted for in the standard circuit - qed measurement scheme .    in the dispersive limit",
    ", the total hamiltonian reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the resonant frequencies of the qubit and the cavity , respectively , @xmath62 is the qubit - cavity detuning , @xmath63 is the qubit - cavity coupling , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the creation and annihilation operators for the cavity mode , and @xmath66 is the third pauli operator acting on the qubit . from equation",
    "it is easy to see that the interaction hamiltonian commutes with both the system and the detector hamiltonians , as in the original coupling scheme .",
    "the strength of the interaction is controlled by the detuning @xmath67 , enabling fast on / off switching . in alternative",

    ", we can first prepare the qubit in the desired state superposition and then transfer it to the cavity .",
    "an additional qubit may optionally be used for this purpose .",

    "[ fig : schemeb ] ( a ) for @xmath90 , is a gaussian of variance 1 , combining the uncertainty given by vacuum fluctuations ( @xmath91 ) with the minimal uncertainty required by the uncertainty principle in order to perform simultaneous detection of both quadratures ( @xmath91 ) @xcite .",

    "each gaussian corresponds to an admissible value for the work distribution , broadened by quantum fluctuations .",
    "since the gaussians are well separated in phase space , the outcome of an individual ( `` single - shot '' ) measurement can be assigned to a given value with high fidelity . as a matter of fact",

    "[ fig : schemeb ] ( b ) can be mapped into the work distribution by projecting it on its angular component ; the result is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : schemeb ] ( c ) .",
    "notice that the quantum uncertainty , represented by the width of the gaussians , can be made negligible by choosing a coherent state with large @xmath92 , and/or by increasing the coupling .",
    "as discussed previously , quantum interference effects can also be observed in scheme b , provided the measurement can not fully distinguish between different outcomes . in the present setting ,",
    "some degree of uncertainty is already embedded in the detector , as coherent states form an overcomplete basis , or , equivalently , they are not orthogonal .",
    "the result of such a partial measurement is illustrated in fig .",

    "therefore , the crossover between the two schemes can be continuously explored by changing the amplitude of the coherent state .",
    "despite the fact that work can not be associated to a hermitian operator , we have shown that it indeed presents typical quantum features , in that ( i ) its statistics depends on the measurement scheme used to retrieve it , ( ii ) it shows quantum interference patterns , ( iii ) it is influenced by quantum uncertainty , i.e. , a revival of quantum interference is observed when we can not distinguish between quantum trajectories leading to different energy exchanges .",
    "the differences we observe in the work distribution boil down to the fact that in order to extract information from a quantum system we must let it interact with a detector and this interaction induces a backaction on the system dynamics @xcite . introducing a quantum detector in our treatment",
    "@xcite makes it possible to unify and consistently interpret all these results .    in the first measurement scheme we considered ( scheme a )",
    ", the information is encoded in the phase accumulated by the detector during the coupling .",
    "this scheme has virtually no backaction ; it can be used to retrieve all the moments of work , but at the price that the resulting distribution is not positive definite .",
    "while counter - intuitive , this reveals connections with a deeper and more fundamental aspect of quantum theory as the violation of a leggett - garg inequality @xcite .",
    "eventually , this apparent contradiction stems from the attempt of interpreting in a classical way a process that is intrinsically quantum @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the second , more conventional measurement scheme we introduced ( scheme b ) relies on a measurement of the detector position . in this case , the measurement backaction can not be avoided but only reduced .",
    "while this approach gives a well - defined work probability distribution , it limits the amount of information that we can extract on the initial coherence of the system .    to test these concepts ,",
    "we have proposed an implementation in circuit qed . using a cavity mode as the quantum detector , we have replaced momentum and position eigenstates by fock states and coherent states , respectively .",
    "the reduced dimensionality of the hibert space of the detector , as compared to the free - particle model , has no practical consequences for scheme a but introduces an intrinsic uncertainty in scheme b. this uncertainty can be understood as due to the overcompleteness of coherent states as a basis , or , equivalently , to the impossibility of measuring both field quadratures without introducing additional noise . yet",
    "the relative uncertainty of the measurement outcome can be reduced to an arbitrary degree simply by increasing the amplitude of the coherent state , thereby recovering the result of a standard projective measurement . in this sense a single bosonic mode can be thought of as the minimal quantum detector capable of capturing the two complementary aspects of the work distribution discussed here . for comparison ,",
    "an interferometric setup based on a single two - level system @xcite can be used to implement scheme a but does not possess enough logical space to encode the information to be extracted in scheme b.    a deeper understanding of the quantum features of work can lead to novel ways to exploit them .",
    "the natural question to ask is if and how these quantum effects can improve the efficiency in storing , manipulating and transporting energy at the atomic scale .",
    "our results can already be used to estimate the energy cost of performing unitary operations on coherent quantum systems , for instance , in the context of quantum computation .",
    "the present work may be a starting point to investigate the role played by other quantum resources , such as entanglement , in the energy exchange between different quantum parties @xcite , and to what extent the transport of heat , which is typically regarded as an incoherent form of energy , exhibits similar quantum effects .",
    "altogether , these concepts may inspire a new generation of thermal machines exploiting quantum coherence at its full potential .",
