    "consider first the strong - coupling case @xmath185 .",
    "for times shorter than the decay @xmath19 , the time - energy uncertainty allows the existence of superpositions of energy eigenstates , which can be localized on either side of the barrier ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "these wavepackets may exhibit hamiltonian dynamics including tunnel oscillations and precession . under these conditions",
    "the rate @xmath141 is quite sensitive to @xmath181 , as it controls the probability for the spin to have tunneled before a time @xmath19 .",
    "it is this sensitivity to @xmath181 , and in turn to @xmath175 , which can lead to large @xmath106 .",
    "when , by constrast , @xmath187 the `` semiclassical '' wavepacket around @xmath208 delocalizes in the tunneling time @xmath211 , evolving towards an energy eigenstate due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "then , there is no coherent oscillation between @xmath208 and @xmath212 , neither precession of the ( averaged ) transverse components , since this is a stationary state .",
    "the dependence on @xmath181 ( and hence on @xmath175 ) is then minimized , as the wavefunction is already delocalized between the spin - up and spin - down states , leading to small @xmath106 values .",
