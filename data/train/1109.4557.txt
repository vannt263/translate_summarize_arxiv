    "strange - meson photoproduction is one of the most practical and useful experimental and theoretical methods to investigate the strangeness production processes in hadron physics . in this article , we report our recent study for @xmath0 photoproduction , which employs the effective lagrangian method in the tree - level born approximation . in previous studies , it was noted that the production rate of theoretical calculations is insufficient to reproduce the experimental data for this process in the threshold energy region  @xcite .",
    "to explain the discrepancies between theory and experiments , we investigate the role of nucleon resonances whose masses are in this energy region .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 nucleon resonances on top of the relevant nucleon born terms .",
    "we use the resonance parameters extracted from experimental information of the pdg  @xcite or the theoretical predictions of the relativistic quark - model of refs .",
    "our numerical results show that the role of the @xmath4 is essential to reproduce the experimental data for the cross sections of @xmath0 photoproduction , whereas the @xmath5 contribution is rather small .",
