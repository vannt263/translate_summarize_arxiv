    "for many years , the catalog of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ms99 ) was the most important reference in the white dwarf community including a total of 2249 spectroscopically identified white dwarf stars .",
    "similarly , the now regularly updated online incarnation is used by white dwarf researchers on a daily basis and has grown to include nearly 13,000 entries as this publication goes to press .",
    "this is due in large part to the increasingly large number of white dwarfs discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the sdss s huge database of newly discovered white dwarfs has permitted the discovery of previously unknown types of white dwarfs like the carbon atmosphere `` hot dq '' stars @xcite , white dwarfs with gaseous disks @xcite , and even white dwarfs with oxygen dominated atmospheres @xcite .",
    "however , the fact remains that most of the sdss data lack the necessary signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to measure accurately the atmospheric parameters for each star @xcite .",
    "this is largely due to the rather faint white dwarfs observed by the sdss and the practice of having a set exposure time for every field .",
    "consequently , the fainter the star , the lower the s / n of the data . on the other hand , white dwarfs from ms99 are comparatively bright , especially if we restrict ourselves to stars with @xmath1 .",
    "historically , many of the white dwarfs from ms99 have not been particularly well studied despite their relative brightness , which makes it easier to obtain high s / n spectroscopic observations .",
    "indeed , many of these white dwarfs have only a spectral classification , based on photographic spectra , without any further analysis ever having been performed , let alone with modern ccd spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is both important and worthwhile to study these stars , the more so that it is much more feasible to conduct follow - up observations ( i.e. , high - resolution spectroscopy , high - speed photometry , etc . ) for objects of interest , if they are bright .    indeed , some of the early results from our survey have already allowed us to make a few discoveries of our own .",
    "the most notable of these is likely the discovery of the unique nature of gd  362 , originally reported as a highly metallic and massive daz white dwarf @xcite , it was later discovered that the main atmospheric constituent is helium @xcite .",
    "even more important was the discovery of an infrared excess due to the presence of a circumstellar debris disk @xcite around this star .",
    "this lone discovery essentially opened the door to a whole new area of white dwarf research with many groups launching observational campaigns with the specific goal of discovering debris disks around other cool , metal - enriched white dwarfs .",
    "we have also successfully used our survey to refine the empirical determination of the boundaries of the zz ceti instability strip and confirm its purity @xcite .",
    "we were thus able to predict the variability of several new zz ceti pulsators , while also confirming the non - variability of other da white dwarfs near the zz ceti instability strip @xcite .",
    "ours is not the only survey to have recently looked at a substantial number of bright white dwarfs .",
    "the eso sn ia progenitor survey ( spy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also observed about 800 bright white dwarfs , of which many were selected from ms99 .",
    "it is not surprising then that there is a rather large overlap between the spy sample and our own .",
    "however , in the case of spy , the aim of the survey was to obtain multi - epoch , high - resolution spectra in order to detect the radial velocity variations of double - degenerate binary systems .",
    "these could then lead to the identification of possible sn ia progenitors , which were ultimately what they were looking to find .",
    "results of the analysis of the da white dwarfs from spy are summarized in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also presented an analysis of 174 hot ( @xmath2  @xmath3  25,000  k ) da white dwarfs selected from ms99 as well as the _ rosat _ @xcite and _ extreme - ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( euve ; * ? ? ? * ) surveys .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite also presented analyses of da white dwarfs selected from _",
    "rosat _ and _ euve _ , while @xcite analyzed over 200 da white dwarfs discovered in the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "other important studies of large samples of da white dwarfs include the works of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lbh05 ) and @xcite who looked at the complete samples from the palomar - green ( pg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and kiso ( kuv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys , respectively .",
    "these studies defined statistically significant samples of white dwarfs in an effort to derive the luminosity function of the disk white dwarf population . finally , an analysis of over 7000 da white dwarfs from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ) was presented in @xcite with particular attention to the mass distribution of the sample .",
    "@xcite performed a new analysis of the aforementioned sample of da white dwarfs from the sdss and showed that for the analysis of ensemble properties , such as the mass distribution , the sdss data are reliable down to s / n @xmath4 15 .",
    "however , the precise determination of the atmospheric parameters for individual stars remains problematic with such low s / n observations , as in the case of the zz ceti instability strip @xcite .    in an effort to derive the most accurate atmospheric parameters possible",
    ", we also want to incorporate all available improvements to the model atmospheres that we use to study these white dwarfs . with that in mind , we will be using models that include the improved theoretical calculations of the balmer line profiles , including non - ideal effects , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tb09 ) .",
    "seeing as our spectroscopic technique relies on a detailed comparison between observed and theoretical balmer lines , it is crucial that we employ the most accurate and up - to - date models at our disposal . in the same vein ,",
    "two sub - categories of white dwarfs contained within our sample required particular attention in order to obtain accurate atmospheric parameters .",
    "first , there are the hot da and dao stars exhibiting the so - called balmer line problem .",
    "a comprehensive and detailed analysis of these stars has already been presented by @xcite and those results will be included in our analysis .",
    "second , we have da+dm binary systems whose balmer line profiles are contaminated , to varying degrees , by the spectrum of the dm secondary .    as a whole",
    ", we wish to present a detailed analysis of all the hydrogen line white dwarfs from ms99 for which we have obtained optical spectra . in section 2",
    ", we will present the spectroscopic content of our survey .",
    "section 3 will deal with the model atmospheres used for the analysis of our data , and we will present in section 4 the spectroscopic analysis of our entire sample , including particular analyses for certain subsets of white dwarfs .",
    "subsequently , in section 5 we will examine the global properties of our sample including the mass distribution and the mass distribution as a function of effective temperature , and how these compare to other large surveys .",
    "we will then revisit the pg luminosity function , and the empirical determination of the zz ceti instability strip .",
    "finally , we end with some concluding remarks in section 6 .",
    "the goal of our survey was to observe all the white dwarfs listed as da in ms99 , including all subtypes ( dab , dah / p , dao , daz , da+dm ) , with a visual magnitude @xmath1 . along the way",
    ", several da stars were added to the sample through various other projects and collaborations the montral group was involved in . in the final reckoning ,",
    "we had defined a sample of 1503 white dwarfs for which we wanted to obtain high s / n optical spectra . after nearly 8 years of observing , and a total of 19 observing runs in both the northern and southern hemispheres , we succeeded in securing spectra for 1360 of the 1503 white dwarfs we had selected .",
    "this translates to a 90% completion rate .",
    "indeed , the majority of the missing spectra are those of the least bright stars in our sample and objects observable only from the southern hemisphere where we were unable to secure additional telescope time .    in all , 726 spectra were obtained specifically for the purposes of this survey since it began in 2003 . of those 726 spectra ,",
    "568 were obtained between 2003 september and 2011 april at steward observatory s 2.3  m telescope equipped with the boller & chivens spectrograph .",
    "the 4@xmath55 slit together with the 600  line  mm@xmath6 grating blazed at 3568    in first order provide a spectral coverage from about 3000 to 5250    at a resolution of @xmath7  (fwhm ) .",
    "an additional 18 spectra were obtained in 2006 april and 2007 january at the 1.6 m telescope of the observatoire du mont - mgantic where the 600  line  mm@xmath6 grating provided a spectral coverage from about 3100 to 7500    at a similar resolution .",
    "furthermore , a total of 140 spectra from the southern hemisphere were secured during the course of two observing runs in 2007 march and 2007 october , respectively .",
    "first , 84 spectra were obtained at eso s 3.6 m telescope at la silla , chile with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( v.2 ) .",
    "the # 7 grism and a 1@xmath50 slit provided a spectral coverage from about 3300 to 5200    with a resolution of @xmath7   ( fwhm ) .",
    "the remaining 56 southern spectra were obtained at carnegie observatories 2.5  m irne du pont telescope at las campanas , chile with the boller & chivens spectrograph . the 1@xmath55 slit with the 600  line  mm@xmath6",
    "grating blazed at 5000    provided a spectral coverage from about 3500 to 6600    at a slightly better resolution of @xmath8    ( fwhm ) .",
    "there are also 169 spectra that were kindly provided by c. moran ( 1999 , private communication ) . of these ,",
    "eight were obtained at the south african astronomical observatory s 1.9  m radcliffe telescope using the grating spectrograph .",
    "the remaining 161 spectra were obtained at the isaac newton telescope , on la palma , with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph . in both cases ,",
    "the spectra have a resolution of @xmath8   ( fwhm ) .",
    "finally , the sources of the spectra for 0950 + 139 and 1136 + 667 ( two dao white dwarfs ) are described in @xcite . for the remaining 464 stars , we have used archival spectra that have been obtained throughout the years by the montral group during the course of various other projects ( e.g. , @xcite ; lbh05 ) .",
    "these were acquired at steward observatory s 2.3  m telescope with the same instrument and setup described above .",
    "we show in figure  [ fg : histov ] the final distribution of visual magnitudes @xmath9 for our sample of white dwarfs ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* as a comparison ) .",
    "we note that 10 white dwarfs have no magnitude listed in the literature .",
    "the bold histogram shows the distribution for the entire sample while the hatched histogram represents the stars for which we have successfully obtained spectra .",
    "we see that the distribution peaks near @xmath10 and that the majority of our stars have @xmath11 .",
    "we contrast this result with the sample of da white dwarfs from the sdss dr4 @xcite . although the sdss sample contains over six times more white dwarfs , the vast majority of these have @xmath12 , which makes for a much fainter sample overall .",
    "the distribution of s / n for our entire sample of 1360 optical spectra is displayed in figure  [ fg : histosn ] .",
    "the s / n3.2 pixels per resolution element but this value varies for the other instrument setups employed .",
    "] is determined by an estimate of the rms noise per pixel in the continuum between @xmath4 4500 and @xmath4 4700  . over 52% of our sample",
    "have s / n @xmath13 and almost 80% above 50 . only the faintest objects in our sample have s / n that is significantly lower . as such , we have achieved our goal of obtaining high - quality data for the majority of the white dwarfs in our survey .",
    "as previously stated , many of these stars have never been studied using modern ccd spectroscopy .",
    "consequently , it is not surprising to discover that many of the spectral classifications are erroneous ; many of the objects listed in ms99 are not even white dwarfs .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : misclass ] 68 objects that are incorrectly classified as white dwarfs in ms99 .",
    "we provide the spectral classification from ms99 as well as our revised spectroscopic classification for each object along with the appropriate references .",
    "some of these have been known to be misclassified for some time but are still listed as white dwarfs in the online version of ms99 .",
    "of the 68 stars listed in table  [ tab : misclass ] , 20 were recently reported as being misclassified objects in @xcite and we refer the reader to figure  1 of limoges & bergeron for the spectra of those stars . in this paper",
    ", we report the erroneous classification of an additional 27 objects for the first time .",
    "the spectra of these 27 white dwarfs are displayed in figure  [ fg : misclass ] .",
    "many of these are sdb stars that show strong balmer lines that are not as broad as those of their white dwarf cousins due to their lower surface gravity .",
    "however , it is not too hard to see how these objects could easily have been mistaken as white dwarfs , especially using photographic spectra . on the other hand , it is harder to explain how several main - sequence stars were just as easily misclassified . indeed ,",
    "even a quasar ( 0713 + 745 ) has found its way into ms99 .",
    "furthermore , ms99 still lists stars like bd+28  4211 ( 2148 + 286 ) and feige  34 ( 1036 + 433 ) , popular spectrophotometric standards that are known hot subdwarfs .",
    "in addition to the misclassified objects , several stars had two separate entries in ms99 under two different names .",
    "although virtually all of these have since been corrected , we report here that at least two still remain .",
    "the entries for 0525 + 271 and 0526 + 271 refer to the same star , which also happens to be one of the misclassified objects in table  [ tab : misclass ] , and 1100 + 604 and 1104 + 602 are also one in the same .",
    "we also note that 1959 + 059 is gd  226 , not gd  266 as listed in ms99 @xcite .",

    "these spectra were obtained at steward observatory s 2.3  m telescope using the same instrument and setup as described above except that here we used the 400 line mm@xmath6 grating blazed at 4800    to achieve the desired wavelength coverage .",
    "the one drawback was that the use of this particular grating degrades our spectral resolution to @xmath4 9  (fwhm ) from our usual @xmath4 6   .",
    "however , this slightly reduced spectral resolution is still sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we present in figure  [ fg : specdadm ] what we will refer to as our _ red _ spectra for 42 of the 47 da+dm binaries in our sample .",

    "we see in these spectra how the contribution from the m dwarf becomes more significant at longer wavelengths .",
    "more specifically , we see the tio absorption band near @xmath4 4950    that produces the `` kink '' in the red wing of h@xmath19 .",
    "we also note the presence of the strong na d line near 5895    as well as emission , from the m dwarf , in the core of several balmer lines , especially at h@xmath18 .    as a summary , we present in table  [ tab : spectypes ] a breakdown of the white dwarfs in our sample listing the number of stars in each spectral class .",
    "for the analysis of the vast majority of white dwarfs in our sample , we have employed model atmospheres and synthetic spectra appropriate for da white dwarfs .",
    "these are described at length in lbh05 , and references therein .",
    "briefly , these are pure hydrogen , plane - parallel model atmospheres where non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects are explicitly taken into account above @xmath2  = 20,000  k , and energy transport by convection is included in cooler models following the ml2/@xmath18 = 0.8 prescription of the mixing - length theory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the one major upgrade from the models described in lbh05 is that we now use the new and improved stark broadening profiles of tb09 that account for nonideal effects directly in the line profile calculation .",
    "however , since we will wish to compare our results with those of other large surveys , such as spy , we have also fit our sample using models computed with the older broadening profiles of @xcite , and consequently with the ml2/@xmath18 = 0.6 version of the mixing - length theory @xcite , since they were still in use at the time that the spy analysis was performed .",
    "we can thus compare the independent results on a level playing field .",
    "beyond that , performing our analysis with both sets of hydrogen line profiles will also allow us to explore the implications of these improved models on the analysis of da white dwarfs .",
    "although the pure hydrogen models described above are sufficient in most cases , some white dwarfs present unique challenges that require somewhat more elaborate models .",
    "this is the case with the hot dao white dwarfs as well as the hot da stars that exhibit the so - called balmer line problem ( da+bp ) , which manifests itself as an inability to fit all the balmer lines simultaneously with consistent atmospheric parameters .",
    "though the models used to properly fit the spectra of these stars are presented and described at length in @xcite , for the benefit of the reader , we briefly explain them here .",
    "the above - mentioned models have all been computed using the tlusty atmosphere code and the accompanying spectrum synthesis code synspec , both developed by @xcite .",
    "the models are computed in nlte and include carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen ( cno ) at solar abundances @xcite .",
    "as @xcite demonstrated , the inclusion of cno reduces the temperature in the upper layers of the atmosphere , which in turn produces deeper cores for the hydrogen balmer lines , thus overcoming the balmer line problem . as clearly stated by @xcite",
    ", cno acts as a proxy for all metals that may be present in the atmosphere .",
    "as such , the inclusion of cno at solar abundances should in no way be considered as a determination of the abundance of cno in these stars .",
    "the model atmospheres used for the dao and da+bp stars are identical , save for the inclusion of helium in the dao models in order to reproduce the he ii @xmath204686  line .          in figure  [ fg : misc ]",
    ", we presented three da+db binary systems that are included in our sample . in order to properly fit the spectra of these stars",
    ", we will need to combine our pure hydrogen models with pure helium models .",
    "the helium models we have employed are described in @xcite , which are based on the updated grid of white dwarf models described in tb09 in which the improved stark profiles of neutral helium of @xcite have been incorporated .",
    "these models are comparable to those described by @xcite and @xcite , with the exception that at low temperatures ( @xmath2@xmath21 10,800  k ) , the free - free absorption coefficient of the negative helium ion of @xcite is now used .",

    ".breakdown of spectral types [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]",
    "the method used for fitting the observations relies on the so - called spectroscopic technique developed by @xcite , which has been refined by @xcite and more recently by lbh05 , and includes the balmer lines from h@xmath19  to h8 .",
    "the first step is to normalize the flux from an individual line , in both observed and model spectra , to a continuum set to unity at a fixed distance from the line center .",
    "the comparison with model spectra , which are convolved with the appropriate gaussian instrumental profile ( 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12  ) , is then carried out in terms of these line shapes only . the most sensitive aspect of this fitting technique is to define the continuum of the observed spectra .",
    "the approach is slightly different depending on the temperature range in question . for stars in the interval 16,000",
    "k @xmath22 @xmath2  @xmath22 9000  k , where the balmer lines are at their strongest , the normalization procedure involves the use of several pseudo - gaussian profiles ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this procedure is quite reliable as the sum of the pseudo - gaussian profiles represents a good approximation to the observed balmer lines . outside of this temperature range ,",
    "the method becomes more unstable as the continuum between the balmer lines becomes essentially linear .",
    "consequently , for stars with @xmath2  @xmath3 16,000  k and @xmath2  @xmath21 9000  k , we rely on our synthetic spectra to reproduce the observed spectrum , including a wavelength shift , as well as several order terms in @xmath20 ( up to @xmath23 ) using the nonlinear least - squares method of levenberg - marquardt @xcite .",
    "the normal points are then fixed at the points defined by this smooth model fit .",
    "note that the values of @xmath2  and @xmath17  at this stage are meaningless since too many fitting parameters are used , and the model just serves as a smooth fitting function to define the continuum of the observed spectrum .",
    "once the lines are normalized to a continuum set to unity , we use our grid of model spectra to determine @xmath2  and @xmath17  in terms of these normalized profiles only .",
    "our minimization technique again relies on the nonlinear least - squares method of levenberg - marquardt , which is based on a steepest descent method .",
    "sample fits of 20 da white dwarfs , covering almost the entire temperature range of our sample are displayed in figure  [ fg : fits_da ] .",
    "we see that the combination of high s / n spectra with the procedures described above allow us to achieve a proper normalization in each case .",
    "hence , we are able to obtain an excellent agreement between the observed and predicted line profiles for nearly every star .",
    "the spectrum of one star , 0342 + 374 , features emission lines from its associated planetary nebula .",
    "these emission lines can interfere with our normalization procedure but also with our fitting technique and so we simply exclude the affected spectral ranges from both the normalization and fitting procedure .",
    "as we have mentioned , in this study we will be passing from the use of the old @xcite profiles to the new tb09 stark broadening profiles that include non - ideal effects directly in the line profile calculation .",
    "in doing so , it is important to understand what effects these new profiles will have on our atmospheric parameter determinations .",
    "tb09 explored some of these differences ( see their figure  12 ) using the pg sample of lbh05 , but this limited them to a particular range of @xmath2  whereas we can examine the effects along virtually the entire white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "in figure  [ fg : comptg ] , we present the comparison between the atmospheric parameters measured using the older @xcite and the new tb09 stark profiles for the 1151 da stars in our sample . in the lower panel , we see that the correlation between the old and new values of @xmath2  is very tight although the overall trend is to higher temperatures .",
    "this effect is somewhat more evident at higher @xmath2 . in the upper panel of figure  [ fg : comptg ]",
    ", we compare the old and new values of surface gravity . unlike with the values of @xmath2",
    "we note here a much more obvious shift toward higher measurements of @xmath17when using the new tb09 stark broadening profiles .",
    "these results are consistent with those presented in tb09 .",
    "in figure  [ fg : comp_mass ] , we examine how these differences in the measured atmospheric parameters translate to the determination of the mass distribution as a function of @xmath2 . using the old profiles , we see in the top panel of figure  [ fg : comp_mass ] that besides the high-@xmath17  problem at lower temperatures ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and section [ sec : mass ] below ) , the mass distribution dips near 13,000  k. on the other hand , the new profiles seem to even out the mass distribution with the bulk of the stars showing masses between 0.55 @xmath24  and 0.7 @xmath24  before the high-@xmath17  problem takes hold at lower @xmath2 . as such , the new profiles permit an improved determination of the mass distribution as a function of @xmath2  over the older models that employ lemke s stark broadening profiles . specifically , the tb09 profiles produce a relatively constant mass distribution down to about 13,000  k where the high-@xmath17  problem begins to manifest itself .    in the following sections , we will focus on the spectroscopic analysis of all the objects and systems that require particular attention .",
    "these include white dwarfs of spectral types dab , daz , da+dm binary systems , magnetic white dwarfs , and a selection of other unique objects that demanded a more detailed analysis .",
    "the motivation here is to ensure that we determine the most accurate atmospheric parameters possible for each star . with that in mind",
    ", we also note that from this point forward , we will be using the new stark profiles of tb09 exclusively .",
    "in figure  [ fg : misc ] , we displayed five white dwarfs classified as dab stars .",
    "in other words , besides the hydrogen balmer lines , the spectra of these stars also feature lines due to neutral helium . for three of these objects ( 0339 + 002 , 0453@xmath14295 , 1115 + 166 ) , previous analyses have shown that fits assuming a single star do not produce satisfactory results .",
    "in contrast , fits performed under the assumption that the spectrum is that of a da+db double - degenerate binary system have proven successful ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) . with that in mind",
    ", we proceed to fit the spectra of these systems by combining our usual pure hydrogen models with the pure helium models described in section  [ sec : helium ] . when fitting da+db model spectra , the total flux of the system is obtained from the sum of the monochromatic eddington fluxes of the individual components , weighted by their respective radius .",
    "the stellar radii are obtained from evolutionary models similar to those described in @xcite but with c / o cores , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are representative of hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are representative of helium atmosphere white dwarfs .",
    "the fitting technique for these da+db systems first requires that we normalize both the observed and synthetic spectra to a continuum set to unity .",
    "the calculation of @xmath29 is then carried out in terms of these normalized line profiles only .",
    "the atmospheric parameters , @xmath2and @xmath17 , for the da white dwarf and @xmath2  for the db white dwarf are considered free parameters .",
    "we set @xmath17  = 8.0 for the db components in 0339 + 002 and 0453@xmath14295 since the helium lines are rather weak and are not especially sensitive to the surface gravity .",
    "the helium lines are comparatively stronger in 1115 + 166 so for the fit of this star , we allow @xmath17  to vary .",
    "our best fits to the spectra of 0339 + 002 , 0453@xmath14295 , and 1115 + 166 are shown in figure  [ fg : dadb ] .",
    "we obtain excellent fits for all three systems with the fit for 1115 + 166 being exceptionally good . for 0339 + 002 , we obtain higher values of @xmath2  and @xmath17  for the da component as compared to the results of @xcite with a comparable value of @xmath2  for the db component .",
    "this is not an altogether surprising result for the da star since we are using the new profiles of tb09 in our analysis . with regards to 0453@xmath14295",
    ", we obtain a substantially higher @xmath2  and @xmath17  for the da component as compared to @xcite and also a higher @xmath2  for the db white dwarf",
    ". however , the models used in their analysis are considerably outdated and they also performed a four parameter fit allowing the surface gravity of the db star to vary . finally , we get somewhat higher values of @xmath2  and @xmath17  than @xcite for the da component but identical parameters for the db .",
    "the case of hs  0209 + 0832 is different from the above three systems as it is a true dab white dwarf , as first reported by @xcite .",
    "in other words , it is a single star with both hydrogen and neutral helium lines present in its optical spectrum .",
    "furthermore , like gd  323 , this star presents neutral helium lines that are variable , in particular the he i @xmath204471  line @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to gd  323 , @xcite were able to explain the variability as resulting from the accretion of pockets of interstellar matter of varying densities leading to different accretion rates over the course of time .",
    "we show in figure  [ fg : dab ] the best fit to our optical spectrum of hs  0209 + 0832 .",
    "besides the usual balmer lines , we also fit the he i @xmath204471line in order to measure the helium abundance .",
    "to perform the fit , we have used the grid of homogeneously mixed h / he models described by @xcite for dao white dwarfs , with some modifications .",
    "namely , we have extended the grid down to @xmath2  = 30,000  k. however , we do not include cno in the models as there is no evidence of the balmer line problem in hs  0209 + 0832 .",
    "our new determinations ( @xmath2  = 36,550 , @xmath17  = 8.00 ) are quite comparable to the previous measurements of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath2= 36,100 , @xmath17  = 7.91 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath2= 35,500 , @xmath17  = 7.90 ) with our higher values likely due to the use of the new tb09 stark broadening profiles .",
    "conversely , we determine a much lower helium abundance of @xmath30 he / h  = @xmath143.04 as compared to the values compiled in table 2 of @xcite that hover around @xmath30 he / h  @xmath31 with the lowest value at @xmath30 he / h  = @xmath142.32 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that our spectrum was obtained in 2002 december , more than three years after the last observation listed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , wolff et  al .",
    "state that `` a lower rate would reduce the abundance within a few months due to the short diffusion timescale '' . hence",
    ", the most logical explanation for our considerably lower helium abundance determination is that in the intervening time , hs  0209 + 0832 traversed a region of space where the helium density was lower , leading to a reduced accretion rate .    finally , we do not attempt to analyze gd  323 .",
    "indeed , to date there has not been a model that has been able to achieve a satisfactory fit to the optical spectrum of gd  323 despite many attempts throughout the years .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive summary of the various models that have been elaborated over the years in order to explain both the optical spectrum of gd  323 , and the observed spectral variability .",
    "our sample contains the six daz white dwarfs shown in figure  [ fg : misc ] . with the exception of gd  362 , we fit the remaining five daz white dwarfs to obtain @xmath2 , @xmath17 , as well as the calcium abundance . in order to do so , we computed a small grid of synthetic spectra based on our grid of pure hydrogen atmospheres and added calcium in the calculation of the synthetic spectrum only , as described in @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of calcium in the calculation of the synthetic spectrum alone , and not in the model atmosphere itself , is justified since the trace amounts of calcium will have no effect whatsoever on the thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our grid covers @xmath2  from 6000 to 9000  k in steps of 500  k , @xmath17  from 7.0 to 9.5 in steps of 0.5 dex and @xmath30 ca / h from @xmath147.0 to @xmath149.5 in steps of 0.5 dex .",
    "although our standard spectroscopic technique works well even without the inclusion of calcium in the synthetic spectra , the fact is that the calcium h line ( at 3968   ) is blended with h@xmath32  ( at 3970   ) . since the upper balmer lines are especially sensitive to the surface gravity , any failure to properly model the line profile would lead to a less precise measurement of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we are compelled to include the calcium lines in our spectra to avoid this potential source of uncertainty .",
    "our best fits of the five daz stars using the above grid are displayed in figure  [ fg : daz ] .",
    "we have employed essentially the same fitting procedure used for our regular da white dwarfs but here we have three free parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and the calcium abundance .",
    "consequently , we have extended the fitting region around h@xmath32  blueward in order to properly include the ca k line in the fit .",
    "we can see that we are able to reproduce the calcium lines rather well in all cases .",
    "furthermore , we can compare the atmospheric parameters of the three known daz stars , g74 - 7 ( 0208 + 396 ) , ltt  13742 ( 1257 + 278 ) , and g180 - 43 ( 1633 + 433 ) , to previous determinations .",
    "specifically , @xcite obtained @xmath2  = 7260  k , @xmath17  = 8.03 , and log ca / h = @xmath148.80 for g74 - 7 , and @xcite obtained @xmath2  = 8481  k , @xmath17  = 7.90 , and log ca / h = @xmath148.07 for ltt  13742 , and @xmath2  = 6569  k , @xmath17  = 8.08 , and log ca / h = @xmath148.63 for g180 - 43 .",
    "these values are quite comparable to the values we measure here . indeed , some variation is expected considering our models contain several improvements over the ones used in the previous analyses . with respect to the two newly identified daz stars ,",
    "g96 - 53 ( 0543 + 436 ) and lp 849 - 31 ( 1054@xmath14226 ) , their atmospheric parameters seem to suggest that they are rather typical of daz white dwarfs within the same temperature range ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "as stated in section 2 , we have a total of 47 da+dm binary systems in our sample . for nine of those systems ,",
    "we employ our standard fitting technique , as described above .",
    "the fits for these nine systems are displayed in figures [ fg : dadm2 ] and [ fg : dadm1 ] .",
    "of these nine , five are the da+dm systems , listed earlier , for which we were unable to secure red spectra ( see section  [ sec : spec ] ) . in these cases , we simply omit h@xmath19 , the only contaminated balmer line , from our fitting procedure and fit only the balmer lines from h@xmath33  to h8 .",
    "we see in figure  [ fg : dadm2 ] that we are able to achieve a more than satisfactory fit to the remaining four balmer lines . on the other hand , the remaining four da+dm systems , shown in figure  [ fg : dadm1 ] , display little to no contamination from their companion in their blue spectra and we obtain excellent fits to their observed line profiles without the need to omit any lines .",
    "first , the red spectrum of 0116@xmath14231 shows virtually no contamination from a companion , as we can see in the left panel of figure  [ fg : specdadm ] .",
    "similarly , the red spectrum of 0308 + 096 is also devoid of contamination except for emission at h@xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , the blue spectrum 0232 + 035 seems devoid of any contamination while its red spectrum has emission lines in the cores of all the balmer lines .",
    "finally , the blue spectrum of 1247@xmath14176 shows weak emission for some of the balmer lines while we see strong emission in the core of all the balmer lines in its red spectrum ( see the middle panel of figure  [ fg : specdadm ] ) . in the first two cases , there is insufficient contamination in the blue spectra to warrant using the procedure described below to subtract the contamination due to the secondary . in the latter two cases ,",
    "the red spectrum is considerably more contaminated than the blue spectrum . as such ,",
    "our procedure would likely only make matters worse .",
    "furthermore , these seemingly contradictory detections and non - detections of emission lines from the m dwarf secondary in the latter two cases are likely due to the fact that the red and blue spectra were obtained at different phases of the binary orbit .",
    "finally , as described above for 0342 + 374 , we exclude the center of each balmer line from the fitting procedure for 0308 + 096 , 1247@xmath14176 , and 1717@xmath14345 , as they are contaminated by emission lines from their m dwarf companions .        for the remaining 38 systems",
    ", we will take advantage of the red spectra we obtained ( see figure  [ fg : specdadm ] ) in order to remove the contamination due to the presence of the m dwarf .",
    "there have been several studies in the last few years that have analyzed da+dm systems from the sdss @xcite .",
    "one important distinction between these studies and our own is that in the above cases the authors were interested in recovering both the spectrum of the white dwarf and the spectrum of the m dwarf in an effort to study the system as a whole and obtain atmospheric parameters for both stars .",
    "in contrast , we are only interested in obtaining a more accurate measurement of the parameters for the da star .",
    "our fitting procedure for these systems combines the synthetic spectra computed from our pure hydrogen model atmospheres with the m dwarf spectral templates compiled and presented by @xcite .",
    "we attempt to fit a function of the form    @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\quad { } \\times(a_{2 } + a_{3}\\lambda + a_{4}\\lambda^{2 } + a_{5}\\lambda^{3 } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to the observed spectrum .",
    "@xmath35 is the flux due to the da white dwarf and depends on @xmath2  and @xmath17  while @xmath36 , the flux from the dm component , is a function solely of the m dwarf spectral type , from m0 to m9 .",
    "the remaining free parameters are @xmath37 , which is the relative contribution of the synthetic da spectrum and the m dwarf spectral template , @xmath38 , a scaling factor between the composite synthetic spectrum and the observed spectrum , and the coefficients @xmath39 of a third - order polynomial that is meant to account for errors in the flux calibration . in total , there are eight free parameters when we fit the composite spectra .",
    "this means that the values of @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and spectral type that we obtain are meaningless since there are too many parameters used in the fitting process .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , our only interest is to obtain the necessary function to subtract from the composite spectrum in order to remove the dm contamination .",
    "we show in figure  [ fg : dadmfit ] four examples of the fits we obtain to our composite da+dm spectra .",
    "we see that we are able to achieve some very good fits to the observed spectra .",
    "it is interesting to note the varying degrees of contamination from one system to the next .",
    "for example ,",
    "1443 + 336 shows only light contamination in contrast to 1132@xmath14298 where the white dwarf is nearly drowned out by the flux from its m dwarf companion .",
    "indeed , in the case of 1132@xmath14298 , and several other systems , when letting all the free parameters listed above vary , the fitting procedure produced rather poor results . in cases such as those",
    ", we forced @xmath2  and @xmath17  to the values obtained from fitting our blue spectra of the same objects , similar to the fits presented in figure  [ fg : dadm2 ] , and this allowed us to achieve satisfactory results as evidenced by 1132@xmath14298 .",
    "once the spectroscopic fit to the composite spectrum is obtained , we subtract from the spectroscopic solution the contribution of the da component [ @xmath35(@xmath2 , @xmath17 ) ] . in other words ,",
    "we subtract a synthetic da spectrum interpolated to the values of @xmath2 , and @xmath17 , as determined by the fit to the composite spectrum , from the composite spectroscopic solution .",
    "the residual spectrum generated by this procedure represents the contribution of the m dwarf only .",
    "this residual spectrum is then interpolated onto the wavelength grid of the blue spectrum of the same object .",
    "finally , we subtract the residual spectrum from the blue spectrum removing the contamination from the companion .",
    "the next step is to fit the corrected blue spectrum with our standard fitting technique .",
    "we show in figure  [ fg : wd1643 ] an example of the fits for 1643 + 143 before and after the correction has been applied .",
    "we see quite a dramatic change here . indeed , where we had to omit the fits to h@xmath19  and h@xmath33 , we are now able to fit them quite well with the contamination removed .",
    "the @xmath17  value is virtually identical whereas we determine a @xmath2  that is over 2000  k lower . finally , we note the greatly improved agreement between the slope of the observed spectrum and the spectroscopic solution .",

    "we note that all nine stars have @xmath17  values which are substantially higher than the canonical value of @xmath17  =  8.0 , this is not in the least surprising since it is known that magnetic white dwarfs have masses which are higher than the average for normal da stars @xcite .",
    "when trying to fit these magnetic stars with non - magnetic models , this phenomenon is exacerbated by the zeeman splitting which broadens the lines even further causing our spectroscopic solutions to require even higher @xmath17  values .",

    "we now take a closer look at each object in turn .",
    "the star 0239 + 109 is actually one of the 25 magnetic white dwarfs we presented in figure  [ fg : mag ] , however we will see that this case is not quite so simple .",
    "this star was analyzed in @xcite and they had similar difficulties in properly fitting the balmer - line profiles ( see their figure  1 ) . to be more exact ,",
    "the slope of their observed spectrum clearly suggested a cooler spectroscopic solution despite the fact that the hot solution produced the better fit to the balmer - line profiles . as a result ,",
    "their conclusion was that 0239 + 109 must in fact be an unresolved da+dc binary system .",
    "more recently , this star was observed as part of the spy survey and @xcite classified it instead as a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "indeed , the spy spectrum shown in figure  7.3 of @xcite shows what seems to be zeeman splitting of both h@xmath18  and h@xmath19 .",
    "our spectrum of 0239 + 109 is one of the many provided to us by c. moran , and as a result , we have no information regarding the observations ( airmass , etc . ) . however , as we mentioned earlier , when trying to fit the balmer - line profiles of this star , we encounter the same incoherence noted by @xcite , i.e. , the hot solution produces the better fit to the observed balmer lines , but the slope of the spectroscopic solution is incompatible with that of our observed spectrum , which suggests a much cooler temperature .",
    "furthermore , we have in our archives the older spectrum used in the @xcite analysis and obtained by @xcite .",
    "the slopes of the two independent observations are in perfect agreement so we are confident that there is nothing wrong with the data .        in order to get an independent estimate of @xmath2 , we exploit the available photometry and fit the overall optical - near - infrared spectral energy distribution combining the @xmath43 photometry from the usno - b catalog @xcite with the available two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath44 magnitudes . synthetic colors are obtained using the procedure outlined in @xcite based on the vega fluxes taken from @xcite .",
    "the method used to fit the photometric data is described in @xcite . since we have no parallax measurement , we assume @xmath17  =  8.0 .",
    "the best fit to the photometry is presented in the top panel of figure  [ fg : fitphoto ] .",
    "although the photometric fit is not perfect , overall we see that this must be a cool object with @xmath2  @xmath45  k. to reconcile the discrepancy between the slopes of the hot solution and that of our optical spectrum , taking into account the @xmath2  value from the photometric fit , the only possibility is that there are two stars instead of one . hence , we believe that in the end , both @xcite and @xcite were right . in other words ,",
    "the system is an unresolved double - degenerate binary composed of a magnetic da star and a cooler dc white dwarf , a system analogous to g62 - 46 @xcite . in order to get a more accurate measure of the atmospheric parameters for 0239 + 109",
    ", we use a procedure identical to the one employed for the da+db binary systems but here we assume a da and a dc component . figure  [ fg : fitdadc_0239 ] shows our best fit to the composite spectrum and our results are very similar to those obtained by @xcite . as a final check , we plot in figure  [ fg : plotdadc_0239 ] the model flux for",
    "the combined da+dc spectroscopic solution and compare the slope with that of our optical spectrum of 0239 + 109 and see that the agreement is nearly perfect .",
    "we note , however , that despite the excellent agreement between our solution and the data , the magnetic nature of the da component means that our measured values of @xmath2  and @xmath17  for this star should be considered approximate .",
    "this white dwarf is a supposed member of the open cluster ngc  2451 as first reported by @xcite .",
    "however , this claim was later challenged by @xcite based on the proper motion of the star as compared to the proper motion of the cluster .",
    "the analysis of @xcite yielded @xmath2  = 31,000  @xmath46  3000 k , which would seem to concur with our determination assuming the hot solution is indeed the correct one .",
    "unfortunately , the slope of the hot solution does not match the slope of our observed spectrum , which suggests a much cooler temperature for this star .",
    "how can this clear discrepancy between the slopes of our observed spectrum and that of the hot solution be explained ?",
    "first , we verified our observing logs to see if our observations were obtained at high airmass .",
    "this could lead to a significant loss of flux in the blue portion of the spectrum , due to atmospheric extinction , if the instrument is not properly rotated to match the parallactic angle . as it turns out ,",
    "0737@xmath14384 was observed at an airmass of @xmath47  =  1.08 so any such effects would be minimal and we discount that possibility .",
    "next , we attempted to fit 0737@xmath14384 as a da+dc system , but the slope of the combined model does not match the slope of the observed spectrum , as was the case in the previous section with 0239 + 109 , thus a different solution is required to explain the discrepancy . in the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "a value of @xmath48  =  0.05 is adopted for the reddening toward ngc  2451 based on several earlier studies ( see references therein ) .",
    "hence , we speculated that our spectrum might actually be suffering from interstellar reddening .",
    "we used the above value of interstellar reddening to correct our observed spectrum , following the prescription of @xcite , but the effect is negligible as we see in the top panel of figure  [ fg:0737 ] .",
    "however , when querying the nasa / ipac infrared science archive s dust extinction maps in the direction of ngc  2451 , we get a value of @xmath48  =  0.684 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the previously determined values . alternatively ,",
    "if we enter the coordinates for 0737@xmath14384 , we obtain @xmath48  =  0.465 .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the extinction in the direction fo the cluster is quite patchy . for our purposes ,",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath48  =  0.465 .",
    "when we apply this new value of reddening to our data we see , in the bottom of figure  [ fg:0737 ] , that the slopes are now in much better agreement .",
    "we therefore conclude that the hot solution for 0737@xmath14384 is indeed the correct one and the discrepancy between the slopes of the observed spectrum and the spectroscopic solution are due to interstellar reddening .",
    "the spectroscopic fit to the corrected spectrum yields @xmath2  =  30,270 k and @xmath17  =  7.83 .",

    "furthermore , previous determinations of @xmath2  for this object suggest that it is a rather cool da star .",
    "indeed , @xcite find @xmath2  =  7000  k while @xcite find @xmath2  =  8000  k , in both cases the temperature is determined solely from a measurement of @xmath50 .",

    "but how do we reconcile this temperature with the poor fit to the balmer lines with the cold solution ?",
    "the most likely explanation is that 0927@xmath14173 is a da+dc binary system where the continuum flux of the dc component dilutes the observed balmer lines leading to the results seen in figure  [ fg : dd_panel ] . in order to fit the composite spectrum ,",
    "we employ exactly the same method as we did with the da+db systems analyzed in section  [ sec : dab ] .",

    "the atmospheric parameters we have adopted for all the stars in our sample are summarized in table  [ tab : ms99 ] .",

    "the distance to 1503@xmath14070 of 7 pc is obviously underestimated since we fitted this star with non - magnetic models ( see figure [ fg : fitsmag ] ) ; the measured trigonometric parallax actually suggests a distance of @xmath56 pc .",

    "for the da white dwarfs that have been determined to belong to da+db , da+dc , and da+dm systems , we list only the parameters of the da component . finally , we include a note for the weakly magnetic stars that the listed parameters were determined with non - magnetic models .",
    "one of the reported da+bp stars from @xcite , 0102@xmath14185 , is actually a much cooler da white dwarf with @xmath2  = 23,410  k and @xmath17  = 7.78 , in contrast to the parameters previously reported .",
    "an error during data reduction associated the wrong spectrum to this star .",
    "the spectrum that was analyzed as 0102@xmath14185 is actually a spectrum of 2211@xmath14495 from the same observing run .",
    "this reduces the number of da+bp stars from 18 to 17 .      in establishing the reliability of the results of large surveys such as the one presented here , we believe it is both interesting and important to compare our results with other studies that include many of the same objects . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "recent analyses of large numbers of white dwarfs were presented both by lbh05 and @xcite , and although virtually all of the white dwarfs in those studies are included here , we are also using the exact same observations and analysis techniques making any meaningful comparison a rather futile endeavor . instead , what we require is an independent analysis , which is exactly what the spy sample analyzed by @xcite represents .",
    "the da white dwarfs in the spy sample had initially been analyzed in @xcite , however @xcite have re - analyzed the same stars with a new generation of models presented in @xcite .",
    "we must stress that these models did not yet include the improved stark profiles of tb09 .",
    "consequently , as previously discussed , we will be using the results obtained with the @xcite broadening profiles in order to compare with the spy sample . more importantly ,",
    "the white dwarfs from spy have been observed and analyzed with models and techniques completely independent from our own and thus represent a truly distinct data set .",
    "the sample presented in @xcite consists of a total of 615 da white dwarfs of which 362 are in common with our sample .",
    "the reason that there is not a greater overlap is two fold .",
    "first , many of the stars selected for the spy project were taken from the hamburg - eso @xcite and hamburg - schmidt @xcite surveys and these stars were not yet listed in ms99 .",
    "second , as we mentioned earlier , many of the white dwarfs for which we were unable to obtain spectra were situated in the southern hemisphere , and this also contributed to the smaller overlap . in order to be sure we are comparing all stars on an equal footing , we choose to compare only single da white dwarfs ; any known double - degenerate systems or magnetic white dwarfs are excluded .",
    "furthermore , we also omit stars with @xmath2  @xmath3 50,000  k and @xmath2  @xmath21 8000  k for the same reasons outlined in @xcite .",
    "namely , the models used by @xcite do not include effects due to departures from lte at higher temperatures , and the spectra become less sensitive to changes in @xmath17  at lower temperatures .",
    "these last two criteria reduce the number of viable white dwarfs to 330 .",
    "the results of our comparison are presented in figure  [ fg : spy ] .",
    "we see that with the exception of a couple of outliers near @xmath2  @xmath4 14,000  k , the agreement between our @xmath2  values and those from spy is excellent .",
    "the two outliers ( 0318@xmath14021 and 0937@xmath14103 ) are stars where both the cold and hot seeds lead to the same spectroscopic solution ( see lbh05 for a discussion about the hot and cold solutions ) . clearly , this is not the case in the spy analysis of the same objects as they derive larger values for @xmath2  in both cases .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath17  determinations show a clear trend where our measurements tend toward higher values than those from spy .",
    "@xcite had noted this problem ( see their figure  3 ) and discussed several possibilities in an attempt to understand this discrepancy . in particular , they point out that differences between the `` bergeron '' and `` koester '' models could be the cause .",
    "indeed , lbh05 showed a comparison between their results and those of several other studies .",
    "three of those analyses used koester models and all three seemed to exhibit the same trend we see here .",
    "another possibility is that the apparent shift in @xmath17  could be caused by differences in the fitting procedures .",
    "finally , @xcite speculate that the very nature of the spy data could be the origin of the problem .",
    "the spy spectra were obtained with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph at the very large telescope , and the stitching together of the various orders might have introduced artifacts in the spectra . for the complete discussion , we refer the reader to @xcite .        in an effort to better understand this shift in @xmath17  values , we decided to independently fit the spy spectra , which were kindly provided to us by d. koester , using our models and fitting procedures . in figure",
    "[ fg : spy2 ] , we show the comparison between these new values derived from the spy spectra and those from our spectra , all analyzed with the @xcite stark profiles .",
    "first , we note that the agreement between the @xmath2  determinations ( bottom panel ) remains very good .",
    "second , and more importantly , we do not observe any systematic shift in the @xmath17  values ( top panel ) .",
    "there is more scatter in the @xmath17  plot but the overall agreement is markedly better than was seen in figure  [ fg : spy ] . since we obtain a satisfactory agreement between the atmospheric parameters measured from both sets of spectra , we must conclude that there is no problem , a priori , with the spy spectra themselves .",
    "differences between our results and those of @xcite must necessarily arise from differences in the models or the fitting techniques used . nonetheless , the fact that the @xmath2  determinations agree so well in both of the previous comparisons is encouraging .",
    "furthermore , when using an independent data set and relying on our own theoretical framework , we succeed in getting both @xmath2  and @xmath17  values that match rather well .          another independent source of spectra is the sdss . despite the thousands of new white dwarfs discovered in the sdss , very few are in common with our sample .",
    "as we showed in figure  [ fg : histov ] , the much fainter sample of white dwarfs observed by the sdss is the reason that the two samples are so mutually exclusive .",
    "nonetheless , we have retained 83 da white dwarfs in common with both samples .",
    "we obtained the sdss spectra for these stars from the sdss skyserver and proceeded to fit them with the new models that include the tb09 stark broadening profiles .",
    "the comparison between our @xmath2  and @xmath17  determinations and those obtained from the sdss spectra is presented in figure  [ fg : sdss ] . as in the case of the comparison with spy , we note a very good agreement between both sets of @xmath2  values ( bottom panel ) .",
    "however , we also note a second similarity with our spy comparison as the @xmath17  values also seem to be systematically shifted toward lower values from those determined from the sdss spectra .",
    "this concurs with the results of @xcite who explained that any differences must be due to the different spectra employed as they are being analyzed within the same theoretical framework and the same fitting method .",
    "@xcite conclude that issues with the reduction of the sdss data still remain and are the reason for the observed shift .",
    "yet another way of testing the reliability of our results is to compare our derived values of absolute magnitudes with those obtained from parallax measurements .",
    "the added incentive here is that the absolute magnitudes obtained from parallaxes are completely model independent .",
    "we have 92 da white dwarfs in our sample with available parallax measurements from either the yale parallax catalogue @xcite , or _ hipparcos _ @xcite and 9 central stars of planetary nebulae with parallaxes taken from @xcite .",
    "we present in figure  [ fg : compmv ] the comparison between the @xmath57 values from parallax measurements and those obtained through our spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we can see that the overall agreement is quite good and this reinforces our confidence that our results are accurate .",
    "there are a number of obvious outliers in this figure that can be easily explained as unresolved double degenerates ( open circles ) , the most important of which is l870 - 2 ( 0135@xmath14052 ) , discovered by @xcite .",
    "but this is not always the case . for instance",
    ", we find @xmath58 for ross 548 ( 0133@xmath14016 , zz ceti itself ) , for a corresponding distance of 31 pc , while the distance obtained from the trigonometric parallax measurement from the yale parallax catalogue is more than twice as large at 67 pc .",
    "we can not find an easy explanation for this discrepancy unless ross 548 is also an unresolved degenerate binary .",
    "as well , the absolute magnitudes of cool da stars found in the temperature range where the high-@xmath17problem is found are likely to be overestimated ; this accounts for the clump of objects away from the 1:1 correlation in the range @xmath59 .",
    "we must finally mention that the observed agreement is very good within the parallax uncertainties for _ both _ model grids . as tb09 pointed out , despite the fact that the new models yield higher values of @xmath2  and @xmath17  ( i.e. , smaller radii )",
    ", the two effects nearly cancel each other out and the predicted luminosities ( or @xmath57 ) remain largely unchanged .",
    "we display in figure  [ fg : mass_vs_t ] , the mass distribution as a function of @xmath2  for all the stars listed in table  [ tab : ms99 ] .",
    "as previously noted , the bulk of the distribution is centered around 0.6 @xmath24  for @xmath2  @xmath3 13,000  k. below this temperature , the well - known `` high-@xmath17  problem '' manifests itself . several solutions to this problem",
    "have been explored over the years .",
    "first , @xcite showed how helium , spectroscopically invisible below 13,000  k , might explain this problem .",
    "if analyzed with pure hydrogen models , da white dwarfs containing helium would appear to have higher @xmath17  values because the presence of helium increases the pressure in the atmosphere , which is analogous to increasing the surface gravity .",
    "recently , @xcite attempted to detect the presence of the he i @xmath205877  line in six da white dwarfs using high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "they found no evidence of the helium line and concluded that helium was not the solution .",
    "the reason helium was thought to be the key ingredient in explaining the high-@xmath17  problem is because it was expected that convective mixing would bring it to the surface .",
    "in addition , properly calibrating the mixing - length theory used to describe convection was deemed crucial .",
    "@xcite addressed this issue but even with the mixing length properly calibrated , the high-@xmath17  problem remained .",
    "the advent of the tb09 profiles was also thought to represent a possible element of the solution .",
    "however , as we have seen , the new profiles succeed in `` straightening out '' the mass distribution , but do not seem to contribute in fixing the masses at lower @xmath2 .",
    "one of the few remaining avenues of research is the computation of full three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of convection as a replacement to the mixing - length theory that has always been used , but ultimately constitutes an approximation .",
    "the preliminary results from such computations , as presented by @xcite , show that these models produce corrections to the values of @xmath17  that are of the correct magnitude and direction when compared to shifts deduced from the analysis of large samples of da white dwarfs .",
    "hence , it seems that the solution to the high-@xmath17problem has finally been nailed down .    at the hotter end of the white dwarf sequence , we note in figure  [ fg : mass_vs_t ] that the distribution remains essentially continuous around 0.6 @xmath24  unlike the previous determination shown in figure  3 of @xcite where there is a noticeable `` dip '' toward lower masses at higher @xmath2 .",
    "our new result is a consequence of the new determinations of @xmath2  and @xmath17  for the dao stars from @xcite .",
    "as it was demonstrated , the use of the cno models to solve the balmer line problem also resulted in higher masses for the dao stars , consistent with the remainder of the hydrogen - rich white dwarf population .",
    "we show in figure  [ fg : mass_dist ] the histogram that represents the mass distribution of our sample regardless of effective temperature .",
    "besides the full distribution , we also plot the mass distributions for stars above and below @xmath2  = 13,000  k ( in blue and red , respectively ) .",
    "the reason for this split is that we want to analyze the mass distribution for stars that are not affected by the high-@xmath17  problem .",
    "the overall shape of the distribution is in good agreement with the latest determination of the sdss da mass distribution presented by @xcite , the only other large scale analysis of da white dwarfs employing the new tb09 stark profiles . in both cases ,",
    "the mass distribution is strongly peaked near 0.6  @xmath24 .",
    "the other notable features are the high - mass tail and the low - mass component that peaks near 0.45  @xmath24 .",
    "the mean mass of the entire sample is @xmath60  @xmath24 .",
    "however , if we consider only stars with @xmath2  @xmath61  13,000  k , we get a lower mean mass of @xmath62  @xmath24 .",
    "this is higher than the value of 0.613  @xmath24  obtained by @xcite for the sdss dr4 sample .",
    "however , as stated in tremblay et al .",
    ", the mean mass is sensitive to outliers and as we will discuss below , the ms99 sample contains a number of high - mass white dwarfs that are systematically missed by many surveys .",
    "this fact is also evidenced in figure  18 of @xcite where we note a dearth of stars for @xmath63  @xmath24  and @xmath2  @xmath61  20,000  k.    we note in figure  [ fg : mass_vs_t ] a number of rather high mass white dwarfs . in particular , if we restrict ourselves to stars with @xmath2  @xmath3 13,000  k , thus avoiding the troublesome lower temperature regime where the high-@xmath17  problem reigns , we find that there are 20 white dwarfs with a mass @xmath64 1.1 @xmath24 . of these",
    ", 11 were detected by _",
    "rosat _ @xcite .",
    "this trend is not at all surprising . by definition ,",
    "white dwarfs with a higher mass have a smaller radius , which , in turn , means they are intrinsically fainter at a given @xmath2 . as such , magnitude - limited uv - excess surveys ( pg , kuv ) , and many of the other surveys looking for bright blue objects ( montral - cambridge - tololo , edinburgh - cape ) would have skipped these stars because they are fainter . on the other hand , x - ray surveys like the one conducted with _ rosat _ , catalog _ all _ sources , regardless of the brightness of the object .",
    "consequently , since ours is not a magnitude - limited sample , these white dwarfs make their way into our sample by virtue of being included in ms99 .        at the other end of the mass spectrum",
    ", the presence of stars below the dotted lines in figure  [ fg : mass_vs_t ] is significant .",
    "those isochrones include the main - sequence lifetime of the white dwarf s progenitor .",
    "this represents a cutoff of sorts in that the possible progenitor stars would not have had sufficient time to become white dwarfs within the lifetime of the galaxy , nor to have cooled down to those temperatures .",
    "however , it is clear that there exists a non - negligible low - mass component in the mass distribution .",
    "the presence of these stars can be explained if we consider binary star evolution under different guises .",
    "first , several of these stars are known to be unresolved double - degenerate binary systems that have been discovered through searches for radial velocity variations @xcite . in such cases",
    ", the measured atmospheric parameters are misleading if we assume that only a single star is present .",
    "a second possibility involves the merger of two white dwarfs .",
    "indeed , the recent results presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) seem to suggest that there are several very low mass ( @xmath4 0.2 @xmath24 ) white dwarfs that are in close binary systems .",
    "if these white dwarfs merge , they could potentially form a white dwarf with a mass near 0.4 @xmath24 .",
    "finally , there is the possibility of a helium core white dwarf @xcite .",
    "helium core white dwarfs are formed when stars lose a significant amount of their envelope s mass to a companion before the progenitor reaches the tip of the red giant branch . regardless which of these scenarios is the most likely to account for the population of low - mass white dwarfs",
    ", one thing is clear : these low - mass white dwarfs represent a separate evolutionary channel distinct from the usual post - agb models that explain the evolution of the vast majority of white dwarfs .",
    "besides revising the atmospheric parameters of all the normal da stars from the complete sample with the use of the tb09 profiles , there is also a number of white dwarfs whose atmospheric parameters are further refined from the lbh05 analysis as they are members of certain distinct classes of objects . in particular",
    ", there are 16 da+dm binaries , 10 dao stars,017 is included in this sample but , as outlined in @xcite , the parameters obtained by @xcite using their stratified models are adopted , as such , the parameters for this star remain unchanged . ] 5 da+bp stars , 7 magnetic white dwarfs and finally the da component from the 1115 + 166 da+db binary system . for the magnetic white dwarfs",
    "not included in table  [ tab : ms99 ] , we adopt the parameters listed in table  [ tab : mag ] . with these up - to - date atmospheric parameters in hand ,",
    "we proceed to recompute the pg luminosity function in exactly the same manner described in lbh05 .",
    "we compare our new determination of the pg luminosity function with that of lbh05 in figure  [ fg : pg ] .",
    "we see some variations in the individual magnitude bins with respect to the lbh05 result , but this is to be expected considering the revised atmospheric parameters we have employed in computing the luminosity function .",
    "we can also compare the space densities , in other words , the total number of da white dwarfs per pc@xmath65 .",
    "this is determined by integrating the area under the luminosity function .",
    "lbh05 had determined a value  pc@xmath65 but this number is inaccurate for reasons unknown to one of the coauthors of both studies ( p.b . ) who obtained the correct number provided here . ] of @xmath66  pc@xmath65 for @xmath67 .",
    "our new determination of the pg luminosity function yields a slightly lower value of @xmath68  pc@xmath65 for the same magnitude range .",
    "this represents only a 5.1% difference with the value from lbh05 . at first glance",
    ", one might think that the higher temperatures produced by the new tb09 stark profiles means that stars are intrinsically brighter than we once thought , meaning they can potentially be further away thus reducing the local density of white dwarfs .",
    "however , our earlier comparison between the absolute magnitudes obtained from spectroscopy and those determined from parallax measurements showed that the intrinsic brightness of these white dwarfs has not changed in an appreciable way since the stellar radii are also smaller ( higher masses ) . under these circumstances ,",
    "the luminosity function should remain almost unaffected .",
    "however , closer inspection of the individual values of @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath42  reveals that small differences do cause stars to jump from one magnitude bin to the next , which can ultimately affect the determination of the space density of white dwarfs .          in table",
    "[ tab : ms99 ] , we list a number of stars that have been observed in high - speed photometry in order to ascertain if they are photometrically variable . in total , we identify 145 white dwarfs that are photometrically constant and 56 stars that are known zz ceti pulsators . using this photometric sample of 201 white dwarfs ,",
    "we wish to revisit the empirical determination of the boundaries of the zz ceti instability strip .",
    "in particular , we wish to see how the use of the tb09 stark broadening profiles has affected the location of the instability strip as compared to our last result in @xcite .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fg : strip_phot ] the location of these 201 white dwarfs in the @xmath2@xmath14@xmath17  plane .",
    "for the purposes of comparison , we plot as dotted lines the empirical boundaries of the instability strip as determined in @xcite .",
    "our new determination of these boundaries is shown as dashed lines .",
    "first , we notice that the entire strip has shifted by a few hundred kelvins toward higher @xmath2 .",
    "second , we see that the strip has also widened by several hundred kelvins .",
    "these changes are a direct result of the use of the new tb09 broadening profiles .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fg : deltgzz ] differences in @xmath2obtained by using the old @xcite profiles versus the calculations of tb09 , focusing on the range of @xmath2  where the zz ceti instability strip lies .",
    "we see that the new values of @xmath2  are systematically higher than the old values , this explains why the whole instability strip is shifted toward higher effective temperatures .",
    "however , we also notice that @xmath69@xmath2  increases as a function of @xmath2  from @xmath4 200  k near @xmath2  = 11,000  k , to @xmath4 600  k at @xmath2  = 13,000  k. this is the reason that the instability strip is now wider than previously established .",
    "one aspect of the instability strip that remains unchanged is its purity . with the exception of the two `` offending '' stars discussed below ( one pulsator and one non - variable )",
    ", only pulsating white dwarfs are to be found within the instability strip and only photometrically constant white dwarfs without , within the uncertainties .",
    "we stress that the significance of a pure instability strip is twofold .",
    "first , if the strip is pure , one can predict the variability of white dwarfs whose atmospheric parameters places them within the confines of the instability strip .",
    "second , if the strip is pure , then it represents an evolutionary phase through which all hydrogen - rich white dwarfs must pass . as a result , asteroseismological analyses of these stars can yield important information about their internal structure , in particular the thickness of the hydrogen layer .",
    "this in turn can be applied to the entire population of hydrogen - rich white dwarf stars .",
    "we also note that the blue edge seems to be quite clearly defined whereas there is a certain level of ambiguity associated with the location of the red edge .",
    "as far as the blue edge is concerned , the sharp transition between non - variable to variable stars is probably a consequence of very specific conditions being required for the driving mechanism to ignite pulsations at the surface of the white dwarf . on the other hand ,",
    "the dying off of pulsations at the red edge is not so well understood and it is speculated that the interaction between convection and the pulsations is what ultimately signals the demise of variability . it is conceivable that this process is not as clear cut and thus the exact temperature at which a star will cease pulsating is more ambiguous , producing a red edge whose precise location is more difficult to nail down .    as mentioned above",
    ", there are two notable exceptions to the `` pure '' instability strip .",
    "the first of the two offending white dwarfs is 1959 + 059 .",
    "this is a zz ceti star that lies outside the instability strip near @xmath4 11,000  k. this star was first reported as being variable by @xcite . however , our initial spectrum for this object was one of the many provided to us by c. moran ( 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "since the discovery of its variability is more recent , it is likely that the moran spectrum was not averaged over several pulsation cycles as is necessary in order to obtain a proper measure of the atmospheric parameters for zz ceti stars . indeed ,",
    "@xcite report a period of 1350  s and an amplitude of 5.69  mma , consistent with cooler zz ceti stars that have longer periods and larger amplitudes as compared to their hotter counterparts .",
    "these large amplitudes signify that @xmath2  can easily swing back and forth by several hundred kelvins resulting in the star moving in and out of the instability strip @xcite . however , we finally secured a new spectrum for 1959 + 059 , averaged over several pulsation cycles , during our last observing run in 2011 april",
    ". the new values do not substantially change the position of the star in the @xmath2@xmath14@xmath17plane and it remains outside the empirical boundaries of the instability strip .",
    "this is not altogether inconsistent with the notion of a pure instability strip in the context of the difficulty of precisely defining the red edge of the strip , as discussed above .",
    "the second offending star is hs  1612 + 5528 , the non - variable white dwarf lying in the heart of the instability strip .",
    "this star was reported as `` not observed to vary '' by @xcite .",
    "@xcite independently observed hs  1612 + 5528 and also detected no variations down to a limit of 0.2% .",
    "however , there are zz ceti stars with amplitudes as low as 0.05% .",
    "it is possible that in both cases the star was observed during a period of destructive interference .",
    "alternatively , hs  1612 + 5528 could represent the first zz ceti star whose pulsations are hidden from us due to geometric considerations . in other words , since we can not resolve the surface of the star , the excited pulsation mode , or modes , might produce no detectable variations if the combined effect of the alternating hot and cold areas is nil .",
    "this would likely require a chance alignment where , for example , the rotation axis of the star is perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "whatever the case may be , we are planning to secure new high - speed photometry for this star during the next trimester to settle , once and for all , the issue of its photometric status .    finally , in figure  [ fg : strip_surv ] we add all the remaining stars from our survey whose photometric status is unknown .",
    "we can identify a total of 14 zz ceti candidates that lie within the empirical boundaries of the instability strip .",
    "however , as @xcite demonstrated , it is important and worthwhile to observe all white dwarfs that are near either edge of the instability strip as well . it could be argued that adding a few more zz ceti stars to the mix is not especially important since hundreds have now been identified through the sdss and follow - up work . however , the sdss variables are , for the most part , a few magnitudes fainter than the white dwarfs shown here . besides the discovery light curves , it is hard to conceive of meaningful asteroseismological studies of the zz ceti stars from sdss .",
    "in contrast , these brighter candidates could be studied on small to medium - sized telescopes equipped with proper instrumentation .",
    "the most intriguing of all the candidates is certainly 1659 + 662 ( gd  518 ) . with @xmath17",
    "=  9.08 , it would easily become the most massive zz ceti star ever discovered , surpassing even 1236@xmath14495 ( bpm  37093 , ltt  4816 ) the current heavyweight of the group . high - speed photometric measurements of this object are being planned as well .",
    "we have presented the results of our spectroscopic survey of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs from ms99 .",
    "first , we discovered that many stars listed in the catalog are still erroneously classified as white dwarfs .",
    "in particular , we list a total of 68 stars that are misclassified , 27 of which need to be reclassified as the result of our observations .",
    "we then examined the spectroscopic content of our survey .",
    "the majority of stars in our sample are simple da white dwarfs but a number of them show more than just the characteristic balmer lines of hydrogen .",
    "indeed , our sample includes both dab and daz white dwarfs as well as da+dm binaries and magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "in addition , there are several white dwarfs that are cool enough that no balmer lines are present , at least not within the spectral range covered by our observations . with the exclusion of the magnetic stars and the cool , featureless white dwarfs ,",
    "we have analyzed the spectra of all the white dwarfs in our sample . in order to do so , and with the goal of obtaining the most accurate atmospheric parameters possible ,",
    "we have endeavored to use the most modern , up - to - date , and appropriate model atmospheres in our analyses of these white dwarfs .    first , for the analysis of all the hydrogen - rich white dwarfs",
    "we have used models that include the new stark broadening profiles from tb09 .",
    "the analysis of the hot dao and da+bp stars was presented in @xcite and featured models to which cno , at solar abundances , was added in order to overcome the balmer - line problem .",
    "the results of that analysis were incorporated here .",
    "furthermore , we used updated helium atmosphere models to analyze several da+db double - degenerate binary systems and we developed a technique that uses m dwarf templates to correct for the contamination in the composite spectra of da+dm binary systems .",
    "we also analyzed several daz stars by including calcium in the calculation of the synthetic spectrum only .",
    "two of these are newly identified daz stars .    in switching from the older stark broadening profiles of @xcite to those of tb09",
    ", we also explored how our atmospheric parameters have changed as a result .",
    "we observed that the values of @xmath2  are shifted toward higher temperatures while the values of @xmath17show a more obvious and significant trend toward higher values . with that said ,",
    "we also saw how the new profiles improved the overall shape of the mass distribution as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution now remains largely constant around 0.60 @xmath24  until @xmath4 13,000  k where the well - known high-@xmath17  problem takes over .",
    "the new three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of convection presented in @xcite have finally , and convincingly , solved this problem by replacing the more approximate mixing - length theory used to this day .",
    "we also wanted to test the reliability of our results by comparing them with those of an independent study .",
    "the @xcite analysis of da white dwarfs from the spy sample was ideal for this purpose since several hundred white dwarfs were in common with both samples but were observed and analyzed in a completely independent fashion .",
    "we showed that our @xmath2  determinations are in excellent agreement with those of @xcite despite a trend toward higher @xmath17  values in the koester et al .",
    "analysis .",
    "our mass distribution yields a mean mass of 0.638 @xmath24  when considering only white dwarfs with @xmath2  @xmath61  13,000  k. the mean mass is somewhat higher than other determinations , but it is understood to be caused by high - mass white dwarfs that are missed in many surveys but included here .",
    "we also note the presence of a low - mass component , consistent with the results of most other large - scale studies of da white dwarfs .",
    "the low - mass stars are necessarily the product of binary evolution either through mergers or a common envelope phase where a significant fraction of their mass may have been lost .",
    "we also recomputed the pg luminosity function and found a space density which is only slightly lower than that determined by lbh05 .",
    "it would be easy to point the finger at the new tb09 stark broadening profiles since they yield higher temperatures , but they also yield higher @xmath17  measurements that translate to smaller radii .",
    "these facts coupled together produce two very similar values of @xmath57 . however , even small differences can cause stars to switch magnitude bins , which explains our marginally lower value .    finally , we re - examined the zz ceti instability strip and found that the tb09 stark broadening profiles produce a wider instability strip that is also systematically shifted toward higher @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we have identified over a dozen new zz ceti candidates among which might be the most massive zz ceti star ever discovered .",
    "high - speed photometric observations are planned for all candidates in the very near future .",
