    "one of the most commercially important liquid crystal devices is the twisted nematic ( tn ) cell @xcite , which comprises a nematic liquid crystal film sandwiched between two substrates that have been coated with a rubbed polymer film to promote planar alignment with orthogonal azimuthal easy axes .",
    "the local axis of rotational symmetry of the alignment , known as the director , must rotate azimuthally through the depth of the cell in order to satisfy the boundary conditions at both substrates .",
    "the total rotation may be either @xmath0 or @xmath1 radians ; these two degenerate configurations are referred to arbitrarily as _ twist _ and _ reverse - twist _ and regions of the cell in each configuration are separated by domain walls as they are topologically distinct . to lift the degeneracy , a polymer that promotes an easy axis at some small angle to the plane of the substrate",
    "is used @xcite .    micropatterned surfaces consist of micron - scale regions that promote different easy axes .",
    "away from the distorted surface region , the liquid crystal adopts a bulk orientation that depends on the pattern ; by appropriate patterning , it is possible to design a surface to promote an arbitrary _ effective _ easy axis . in this spirit , lee and",
    "clark experimentally showed that a surface micropatterned with alternate planar degenerate and homeotropic stripes will align the liquid crystal azimuthally even though the planar regions are azimuthally degenerate @xcite .",
    "one of the present authors later showed analytically @xcite that in contrast to the usual mechanism , it is the elastic anisotropy that determines the preferred alignment direction so as to minimize the elastic energy .",
    "if the twist elastic constant @xmath2 is less than the splay @xmath3 and bend @xmath4 elastic constants , as is the case for most nematic materials , the azimuthal easy axis lies along the length of the stripes .",
    "the polar easy axis is determined by the relative width of the planar and homeotropic stripes .    in the present work",
    ", we use a striped surface made by microcontact printing of self assembled monolayers ( sams ) of @xmath5-functionalised alkanethiols @xcite on gold to demonstrate that this elastic - anisotropy mechanism is sufficiently strong to permit the construction of a twisted nematic cell .",
    "since the homeotropic - planar mark - space ratio is 1:1 , the cells have a high tilt angle ( @xmath6 ) and exhibit a novel uniform domain forbidden in a conventional tn cell .",
    "the micropatterned twisted nematic cell was constructed as follows in cleanroom conditions : glass microscope slides were used as substrates and were thoroughly cleaned with ultrasonic agitation in detergent ( decon 90 ) , ultra pure water and acetone .",
    "the slides were rinsed in water and immersed in pirahna etch ( 70% sulphuric acid , 30% hydrogen peroxide ) for 20 mins .",
    "the slides were rinsed and dried in nitrogen before being loaded into a thermal evaporator ( edwards auto 306 ) . a 3 nm layer of cr",
    "was evaporated first , to aid the adhesion of a subsequent 30 nm layer of au .",
    "the slides were rotated during evaporation to ensure uniform coverage and to avoid any anisotropy in the roughness of the gold surface which can lead to liquid crystal alignment effects @xcite .",
    "pdms ( sylgard 184 , dow corning ) was formed in a ratio of 9 parts elastomer to 1 part curing agent .",
    "the mixture was well stirred , degassed under vacuum and poured into a mould containing a si wafer with 1@xmath7 m etched stripes .",
    "prior to this , the wafer was immersed in a 1@xmath8 solution of perflurotriethoxysilane ( fluorochem ltd . ) in dichloromethane for 12 hours .",
    "this silane monolayer ensures that the cured pdms can be removed from the etched wafer without breaking @xcite .",
    "the pdms was cured in an oven at 60@xmath9c for 12 hours , carefully cut up into stamps and finally rinsed in ethanol to remove any short chain pdms material @xcite .",
    "the pdms stamps were inked on the printing surface with a 7 mm solution in ethanol of perfluorinated alkanethiol ( @xmath10 ) , which is known to promote homeotropic alignment in 6cb@xcite .",
    "the inking solution was allowed to diffuse into the pdms for approximately 3 mins and then the printed surface was dried with nitrogen .",
    "the stamp was then placed on a gold substrate for 3 mins .",
    "good quality printing occurs when the stamp is in conformal contact with the substrate @xcite , which can be observed during the printing process .",
    "the printed surface was then immersed for 12 hours in a 3 mm solution in ethanol of mercapto - undecanoic acid ( @xmath11 ) , which is known to promote planar degenerate alignment in 6cb@xcite .",
    "the micropatterned surfaces were then rinsed in clean ethanol and water and then dried .",
    "a cell was constructed from two patterned substrates and 23@xmath7 m pet spacers by first placing the liquid crystal 6cb ( merck ) on one surface , heating into the isotropic phase and then placing the second patterned substrate on top with the stripes orthogonal to the first substrate .",
    "this procedure was adopted as lc cells which contain perfluorinated alkanethiol sams are difficult to fill with liquid crystal by capillary action .",
    "the completed cell was then cooled to room temperature .    when viewed between crossed polarizers under the microscope , a number of domains become apparent ( fig .",
    "[ cap : polarising ] ) : the majority of the cell [ fig .",
    "[ cap : polarising](a ) ] appears bright and remains bright when the cell is rotated azimuthally with the polarisers fixed ; other regions [ fig .",
    "[ cap : polarising](b ) ] behave in a similar manner , but are separated from the first by dark lines ; the final class of regions observed in fig .",
    "[ cap : polarising](c ) appear dark when the striped surfaces are aligned with the polarizers , but become bright when the cell is rotated with the maximum intensity at @xmath12 .",
    "the latter regions are not separated from the former by a distinct line , rather the intensity of transmitted light varies smoothly over a distance of a few microns from that of the surrounding region ( which is of the first or second type ) to that of the enclosed region ( of the third type ) .",
    "schematic of the director configuration across a transition region between the httn and un configurations .",
    "the micropatterning causes rapid variation of the director near the substrates ( see insets ) which enforces an average effective orientation as a boundary condition on the bulk configuration ( main figure ) . ]",
    "the first and second regions are twist and reverse twist domains typical of a twisted nematic cell and so we shall refer to them as high tilt twisted - nematic ( httn ) states : the director rotates azimuthally by @xmath13 from the bottom substrate to the top substrate .",
    "these configurations act as polarisation converters and thus permit transmission independent of azimuthal angle .",
    "the optical behaviour of the uniform third regiondenoted hereafter the uniform nematic ( un ) stateis identical to that of a planar cell and so the director in this region must be confined to a plane defined by the surface normal and a vector that points in the direction of one of the sets of stripes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , a possible director profile is shown for the httn and un configurations and an experimentally observed transition region .",
    "the un domains are of particular interest because they are not observed in a conventional twisted nematic cell .",
    "no regions are observed that are dark irrespective of orientation with respect to the polarizers ( the behaviour of a homeotropic cell ) .",
    "we now construct a model for the observed behaviour by evaluating the energy of the two observed configurations .",
    "let us define a coordinate system local to the surface where the @xmath14-axis lies along the wavevector of the stripes , the @xmath15-axis lies along the length of the stripes and the @xmath16-axis lies perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "the director may be parameterized@xmath17 then the frank - oseen elastic energy density@xmath18 within the approximation @xmath19 has , as was shown in @xcite , the form@xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] in which @xmath22 and where the subscripts indicate derivates taken with respect to these coordinates .",

    "the coefficients@xmath36 are obtained .",

    "; there is no bulk elastic deformation and the energy is thus the energy of the distorted surface regions . since there are two perpendicularly patterned substrates some care must be taken in identifying @xmath40 with @xmath41 , which was defined above with reference to the pattern on one substrate .",
    "the total energy of the un state per unit area , @xmath42 , is @xmath43 where @xmath44 $ ] is associated with the lower substrate and @xmath45 $ ] is associated with the upper substrate .",
    "this energy has a minimum value when @xmath46 or @xmath47 i.e. when the director is aligned along the length of one or the other of the patterns , which is consistent with the experimentally observed configuration above .    in the httn state ,",
    "the azimuthal orientation is fixed at the surfaces by the elastic anisotropy mechanism such that the component of the director in the plane of the substrate lies along the length of the stripes , and the azimuthal orientation rotates by @xmath13 through the cell thickness . since the period of the micropatterning @xmath48 the cell thickness , in the middle of the cell the director depends on the @xmath16-coordinate only .",
    "the characteristic penetration length of the distorted surface regions is of order @xmath49 and so the small azimuthal rotation of the director over this length ought to leave the energy due to a distorted surface region unchanged from the situation above where @xmath41 is a constant @xmath50 .",
    "the surface contribution to the httn state is therefore@xmath51    it is also necessary to include the contribution from the azimuthal rotation of the director in the bulk .",
    "in contrast to the conventional tn cell , the polar angle is not constant throughout the cell ; the director can reduce the magnitude of the twist deformation by tilting towards homeotropic in the centre of the cell at the expense of a slight splay or bend deformation . from recent simulation of the httn state @xcite , a suitable ansatz for the bulk director configuration is@xmath52 where the amplitude of the perturbation @xmath53 , the magnitude of the tilt perturbation , is a free parameter that must be varied so as to minimize the total free energy .",

    "a twisted nematic cell has been constructed using substrates micropatterned with sams by microcontact printing .",
    "characteristic twisted and reverse twisted states have been observed in the cell , however these are stabilized not by azimuthal anchoring as in a conventional tn device , but by a recently elucidated elastic anisosotropy mechanism due to rapid variation of the polar easy axis .",
    "this mechanism promotes rather weak azimuthal anchoring which , if the polar anchoring energy is sufficiently weak , may be of comparable energy to the bulk twist ; facilitating a transition from the twist or reverse - twist states to a uniform state that is not facile in conventional tn cells due to the much higher azimuthal anchoring energy .",
    "we found the critical polar anchoring energy for such a transition to be @xmath67 .",
    "a further feature of the micropatterned tn cell is that the pretilt angle is much larger ( @xmath6 ) than in a conventional tn display and readily controllable by adjusting the design parameters of the patterning .",
    "an interesting phenomenon has been elucidated that should be exhibited by any high pretilt tn device regardless of the anchoring mechanism : there is a spontaneous tendency for the director to tilt towards the planar or homeotropic orientations depending on the relative magnitude of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the sams technique has for the first time been demonstrated to permit the fabrication of device - scale patterns , and the rich phase diagrams that arise in cells constructed from micropatterned surfaces suggest the possibility of interesting additional phenomena such as bistability .",
