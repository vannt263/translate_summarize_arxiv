    "cold and ultracold molecules offer a large variety of applications in quantum information  @xcite and quantum simulation  @xcite as well as for high precision measurements  @xcite or for quantum chemistry and cold collision studies  @xcite .",
    "triggered by these prospects , an immense effort has been focused on the development of methods for the production of cold and ultracold molecules during the last years .",
    "the coldest molecular ensembles have been achieved based on association of ultracold atoms using feshbach resonances or photoassociation  @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques involve substantial experimental effort and the molecular species accessible are restricted to dimers composed of laser cooled atoms , thus mainly to alkali dimers .",
    "a more general approach is the direct cooling of molecules . here",
    "buffergas cooling  @xcite , deceleration after , e.g. , supersonic expansion  @xcite , and velocity filtering  @xcite are widely applicable .",
    "however , these methods are mainly suited to prepare ensembles above temperatures of about .",
    "prospects for direct cooling to ultracold temperatures have recently appeared in the form of laser cooling of molecules  @xcite .    in our group",
    ", we have developed an alternative method for direct motional cooling of molecules using optoelectrical cooling  @xcite .",
    "this sisyphus - type cooling scheme is in particular suited for polyatomic molecules , meaning molecules that are composed of more than two atoms .",
    "it is expected to reach temperatures below and thus bridge the gap to a regime where evaporative or sympathetic cooling should be possible . to further develop our method , e.g. , to add internal state cooling and control , we have to be able to state selectively detect internal states .",
    "unfortunately , commonly used techniques for rotational state detection of molecules such as resonance - enhanced multi photon ionization ( rempi )  @xcite and laser - induced fluorescence ( lif )  @xcite rely on the excitation of electronic states . especially for polyatomic molecules , the excitation of electronic states , however , can lead to rapid predissociation  @xcite , causing an enormous line broadening and thus a loss of state selectivity .",
    "in addition , almost all electronic transitions lie in the uv , some in the deep uv and the generation of laser light at these frequencies can be experimentally challenging .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed investigation of a rotational - state detection technique that is suitable for a large variety of molecular species , especially polyatomic ones .",
    "our method is based on state - selective depletion of trapped molecules .",
    "in contrast to previous experiments  @xcite , our depletion method does not incorporate electronic excitations but uses instead vibrational and rotational transitions to transfer the molecules from the rotational state of interest to an untrapped state .",
    "moreover , the detection proceeds in a homogeneous - field dc electric trap that allows to spectrally resolve the transitions  @xcite .",
    "the long trapping times of more than inside our trap enable us to implement slow depletion processes such as the use of optical pumping via a vibrational mode .",
    "a big advantage of our method is that the detection of the molecules themselves can be accomplished by state insensitive techniques such as a quadrupole mass spectrometer .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : schemes ] we first discuss general schemes for detecting the population of rotational states of symmetric top molecules .",
    "we mainly focus on two complimentary schemes based either on the use of microwave ( mw ) transitions alone , or based on a combination of microwave and infrared ( ir ) transitions .",
    "the experimental setup and the implementation of these schemes for the symmetric top molecule @xmath1 is described in section  [ sec : exp ] .    the key challenge for the experimental realizations of the detection schemes is to resolve all three symmetric top rotational quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "due to a small dependence of the rotational transition frequencies on @xmath3 and @xmath0 this can not be achieved without effort . in particular , to discriminate @xmath3 and @xmath0 , we need to drive transitions affecting desired states with specific @xmath3 and @xmath0 without driving unwanted transitions affecting unwanted states .",
    "we therefore carefully investigate the spectral resolution inside our homogeneous - field electric trap in section  [ sec : limit ] .",
    "subsequently we consider the position of wanted and unwanted transitions in section  [ sec : sel ] .",
    "based on these considerations , in section  [ sec : rates ] we examine the dynamics of the depletion using rate equations .",
    "experimental results are shown in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement between the measurements and results from the rate model .",
    "both confirm that while discriminating the @xmath4 quantum number is relatively easy , discriminating @xmath3 and @xmath0 is more difficult .",
    "however , using a combination of depletion schemes , in section  [ sec : results.ird ] we demonstrate a state detection which only depends on the population of molecules in states with a single @xmath3",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : results.m ] we present results for the detection of molecules exclusively populating a single @xmath0-substate , characterized by single @xmath2 and @xmath0 quantum numbers .",
    "the general idea of all detection methods shown in this paper is to selectively remove molecules in states which we want to detect from the trapped ensemble .",
    "the difference in signal of measurements with and without depletion then yields the state selective signal .",
    "we present two methods involving the driving of rotational and/or vibrational transitions to transfer the population to untrapped states . as the molecular parameters ( e.g. the rotational constants , or vibrational transition frequencies , or spontaneous decay rates ) can vary over a large range",
    ", the individual advantages of the two methods can be used for different rotational states or molecular species .      before discussing our rotational state detection",
    ", we briefly review the properties of symmetric top molecules .",
    "the rotational state of a symmetric top molecule is described by three quantum numbers : the total angular momentum @xmath4 , its projection onto the molecular symmetry axis @xmath3 , and the projection on the electric field axis @xmath0 . in the following",
    "we will denote the rotational state by @xmath5 with @xmath6 chosen positive . in the case of no interaction with external fields",
    "the rotational energy is given by @xmath7 here , the first two terms correspond to the rigid rotor approximation with rotational constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the last three are small first - order corrections due to centrifugal distortions .    in the presence of an electric field the degeneracy of the @xmath0 states is lifted according to the first order stark shift , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the permanent dipole moment and @xmath12 is the electric field strength . for typical electric fields in our experiment ,",
    "this splitting is on the order of tens to hundreds of and depends on all three rotational quantum numbers @xmath4,@xmath3 and @xmath0 . as all experiments in this paper are performed with the symmetric top molecule @xmath13 , we summarize the associated molecular constants in table  [ tab : const ] .",
    ".summary of molecular constants for ch@xmath14f  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to rotational states , molecules can populate excited vibrational states in various vibrational modes . in this paper",
    "we consider molecules that almost exclusively populate the vibrational ground state at room temperature .",
    "however , we are able to deliberately drive a vibrational transition and use the subsequent spontaneous decay for state manipulation .",
    "all state manipulation , rotational and vibrational , is carried out by driving electric dipole transitions and exploiting spontaneous decays that obey the selection rules @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "-sublevels are omitted .",
    "coupling all @xmath17 transitions ( fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) with microwaves ( green lines ) transfers all molecules populating these states to the untrapped @xmath18 states .",
    "note that in addition to the stark splitting between neighboring @xmath0 shown in the figure , a much larger offset energy of about @xmath19 exists between the states @xmath4 and @xmath20 , as indicated by the bent arrow . ]",
    "the transition frequency between rotational states depends on the quantum numbers @xmath4 and to some extend on @xmath3 and @xmath0 ( see above ) .",
    "we take advantage of this for our first state detection method , microwave depletion ( mwd ) . by driving microwave transitions between neighboring rotational @xmath4 states",
    "we selectively detect sets of rotational states . as shown in figure  [ fig : schememwd ] , we drive @xmath17 transitions for a specific @xmath4 and @xmath3 while addressing all @xmath0 .",
    "this couples all states of our set to the untrapped @xmath18 states , successively removing these states from the trapped ensemble .",
    "mwd as just described can be used to detect the population of sets of rotational states with quantum numbers @xmath4 and @xmath20 . detecting the population of a single rotational @xmath4 state",
    "however is not directly possible as the @xmath4 state must be coupled to the neighboring state with @xmath20 and/or @xmath21 .",
    "this problem can in general be solved by performing two measurements and taking the difference .",
    "for example , a first measurement gives the population of states with @xmath22 and @xmath23 and a second the population of states with @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "the difference of both measurements yields the population of a single rotational state with the quantum number @xmath4 .      , @xmath24 transition ( red arrows ) .",
    "since the stark splitting is almost the same in the excited state as in the ground state , we address all @xmath0-substates simultaneously . the spontaneous decay ( big orange arrows )",
    "leads to a population transfer to lower lying @xmath0 states . in the process",
    "the @xmath25 states get populated , which are coupled to the @xmath4 state using microwaves ( green lines ) . in combination ,",
    "the entire population of the shown set of states is transferred to the untrapped @xmath18 states .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath26 , no @xmath21 states exists , as @xmath27 . ]",
    "our second depletion method uses optical pumping via a vibrational excitation to deplete the population of the addressed states .",
    "these vibrational transitions typically lie in the infrared and we hence entitle this method infrared depletion ( ird ) .",
    "the scheme is shown in figure  [ fig : schemeird ] . a @xmath24 q - branch",
    "vibrational transition is driven to pump the population to lower lying @xmath0-substates thus successively transferring the population to the untrapped @xmath18 states .",
    "in addition , a spontaneous decay can change @xmath4 by @xmath28 leading to population of the states @xmath21 and @xmath20 . as a detection via depletion",
    "is only useful if the population of the chosen set of states is entirely transferred to untrapped states we in addition have to deplete the states with @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "this can be achieved with appropriate microwave couplings as shown in figure  [ fig : schemeird ] .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath26 , spontaneous decay to a state with @xmath21 is forbidden as @xmath3 is conserved and has to be equal to or smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "thus , only states with the two quantum numbers @xmath4 and @xmath20 are depleted .",
    "it is needless to say that using p- and r - branch vibrational transitions for ird is a valid alternative , especially as it could eliminate the need for coupling the @xmath4 and @xmath25 states with microwaves .",
    "however , the frequencies for p- and r - branch transition are spread over a large range . in the q - branch ,",
    "the close proximity of the transitions from all rotational states has the big advantage that several rotational states can be addressed with the same laser source ( see later discussion ) .",
    "here we summarize some general aspects of mwd and ird for a comparison .",
    "first , the timescale for depletion has distinct reasons for mwd and ird . whereas the available microwave power sets the timescale for microwave depletion , for ird it is given by the spontaneous decay rate of the vibrational excited state .",
    "second , the distribution of lines in the mw and ir spectrum is determined by different regularities .",
    "as we will see in the course of this paper , this can be exploited to master the main challenge of our detection : depleting the states of interest while avoiding to address unwanted states with close lying transition frequencies .",
    "the frequency for driving rotational transitions between @xmath4 and @xmath20 states is in first approximation given by @xmath29 ( see equation  [ eq : rot ] ) , and hence differs by at least @xmath30 for different @xmath4 . a dependency on @xmath3 , however , is only introduced by small corrections due to centrifugal distortion and the stark shift of the @xmath0-sublevels , where both shifts are much smaller than @xmath8 . resolving the @xmath4 quantum number with microwaves",
    "is thus substantially easier than discriminating different @xmath3 or @xmath0 .",
    "q - branch ir transitions on the other hand are more randomly distributed because the rotational constants of the excited states can be quite different for different vibrational modes .",
    "couplings between vibrational modes can additionally shift the transition frequencies .",
    "thus each vibrational transition has to be investigated individually with respect to resolving @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "for ch@xmath14f we investigate the transitions of interest in section  [ sec : sel ] .",
    "a final difference is that ird employs fewer mw frequencies than mwd ( see figure  [ fig : schemeird ] ) .",
    "moreover , the transitions needed for ird have in general higher clebsch gordan coefficients and smaller differential stark shifts than the transitions additionally needed for mwd .",
    "thus less overall mw power is needed for ird hence reducing the probability to drive unwanted transitions .",
    "as we will see , this is an advantage of ird .      up to now",
    "we have discussed the depletion of sets of states while addressing all trapped @xmath0-substates .",
    "we now consider the detection of the population of a single @xmath0-substate @xmath31 .",
    "while a depletion of a single @xmath0-substate alone is only possible for @xmath32 , for @xmath33 it is at least theoretically possible to deplete two sets of rotational states which differ by the single @xmath0-substate of interest .    as an example",
    ", we discuss the depletion of the single @xmath0-substate @xmath34 using mwd and ird ( see figures  [ fig : schememwd ] and  [ fig : schemeird ] ) . in both cases",
    "the mw coupling @xmath35 is the only one that addresses the @xmath34 state .",
    "the population of this state is detected by running the whole experimental sequence twice : the depletion ( mwd or ird ) is applied once with driving the @xmath35 transition and once without .",
    "the difference of both measurements yields the population in the @xmath34 state .",
    "an extension to other single @xmath0-substates is possible but at the same time more challenging due to experimental limitations . using mwd",
    "any single @xmath0-substate can be detected by coupling all @xmath0-substates up to the desired single @xmath0-substate and measuring twice as explained above . to be able to implement this scheme ,",
    "a sufficient spectral resolution is needed to resolve all individual transitions . in the case of ird one",
    "has to keep in mind that spontaneous decay can lead to population transfer to the state of interest .",
    "[ sec : exp.scheme ]     for mwd and ird .",
    "stark shifts are plotted to scale and all involved transition frequencies are calculated for the typical electric field in the homogeneous field region of our trap ( @xmath36{v / cm}$ ] with @xmath37{kv}$ ] applied to the microstructures and an offset of @xmath38{v}$ ] applied between the capacitor plates ; see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath39 is the mw transition frequency between the neighboring @xmath4 states for zero electric field ( bent blue arrows ) .",
    "the applied mw transitions between the @xmath0-substates are marked in green and orange and the corresponding frequencies specify the detuning from @xmath39 .",

    "a unique design based on trapping molecules between a pair of microstructured capacitor plates allows a tunable homogeneous electric field to be applied in a large fraction of the trap volume  @xcite .",
    "homogeneous fields are essential since stark broadening due to the trapping fields is the limiting factor in resolving different rotational transitions inside our trap .      for all measurements discussed in this paper",
    "the underlying experimental sequences are similar : initially , molecules generated by velocity filtering via a quadrupole electric guide  @xcite are loaded into the electric trap for .",
    "subsequently , molecules are stored in the trap , allowing a depletion measurement to be performed .",
    "finally , during the last molecules are unloaded and guided to a quadrupole mass spectrometer for detection .",
    "sisyphus cooling can be optionally applied to the molecules in the states @xmath40 during loading and during the initial period of storage  @xcite . in particular , this substantially increases the fraction of molecules in the states @xmath40 , which is useful for a number of measurements in this paper .",
    "although we present a general approach to detecting rotational states , we focus on a specific set of states for the experimental demonstration with ch@xmath14f . here , the four lowest @xmath4 states with @xmath41 are well suited as states with @xmath41 have an enhanced population in our trap due to spin statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : schemes ] shows the detailed depletion schemes experimentally demonstrated in this paper , specifically with the stark shifts to scale and including all transition frequencies .",
    "the vibrational excitations of the @xmath42 symmetric ch - strech mode are used for ird .",
    "the ir transitions are driven by a continuous - wave optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) that is operated at an idler wavelength of .",
    "the frequency is stabilized by locking the pump beam at and the signal at about to a frequency comb .",
    "a great feature of the opo system is the ability of mode - hop free tuning by about with a piezo control of the pump laser . with a recently developed , fast ramping and locking system , we are able to ramp the frequency within our tuning range and relock to the frequency comb within milliseconds . for example , a ramp between the two needed vibrational transitions from @xmath43 and @xmath44 for depletion , separated , can be performed in .",
    "this enables us to drive the two vibrational transitions quasi - simultaneously by changing frequencies every fast compared to the decay rate of of the vibrational excited state .",
    "the microwaves at for coupling the @xmath43 and @xmath45 states and at for coupling the @xmath44 and @xmath46 states are produced with amplifier - multiplier chains .",
    "an aeroflex frequency synthesizer producing up to serves as a source . due to the ability to switch the output frequency within a few all needed mw transitions",
    "can be driven quasi - simultaneously .",
    "we cycle all frequencies with a rate that is fast compared to the total rate with which we drive rotational transitions .",
    "we tune the duty cycle of the individual mw frequencies to adjust their effective power .",
    "to obtain the electric field distribution . for comparison with the simulation",
    "the measured depletion signal is converted into the electric field distribution as explained in the main text .",
    "the frequency scale for the unconverted data is indicated . to resolve the flanks , we measured with a higher mw power ( blue circles ) .",
    "in addition , we performed a narrow scan at lower power around the peak value ( red dots ) .",

    "part  ( b ) is measured with an increased offset of @xmath49{v}$ ] between the plates . ]",
    "the main ingredient of our experiment is our homogeneous - field electric trap .",
    "this trap allows us to dramatically reduce the problem of stark broadening and thus significantly increases the spectral resolution compared to , e.g. , quadrupole traps . as the spectral resolution is important for achieving state selectivity , we carefully investigate our electric field distribution .",
    "specifically , we measure the spectrum of the single mw transition @xmath50 , where the line shape of this transition is almost exclusively given by the stark broadening and thus reflects the electric field distribution .",
    "the extracted electric field distribution can then be used to calculate the line shape of any other transition of interest .    for the measurement we used a scheme based on the single @xmath0 state detection via infrared depletion to detect the population in the state @xmath51 . as explained in section",
    "[ sec : scheme.m ] , driving ir transitions from @xmath43 with @xmath52 and @xmath24 and coupling all @xmath53 transitions with microwaves leads to depletion of all states within the @xmath54 manifold except the @xmath51 state .",
    "we verified that the @xmath53 transitions are saturated .",
    "thus , by adding a fourth mw frequency , any additional depletion can only be caused by the depletion of the @xmath51 state via our target transition @xmath50 . to obtain the line shape of the transition we varied this mw frequency .",
    "the @xmath50 transition is always driven resonantly at the corresponding electric field values .",
    "we thereby probe the probability for a molecule to be at a position in the trap with the given electric field strength .",
    "this probability is essentially the electric field distribution .    to improve statistics",
    "the measurement is performed with a molecular ensemble cooled to ( see section  [ sec : exp ] ) . before unloading we applied of depletion as explained above . as the occurrence probability of the electric field values varies by more than an order of magnitude",
    ", we perform two mw frequency scans .",
    "first , we use a higher power of the scanning mw that is adjusted to measure the flanks of our line shape but leads to a complete depletion at the peak .",
    "second , we perform a narrow scan around the peak value with about ten times less power .    to extract the electric field distribution from our data we use a simple theoretical model .",
    "the rate @xmath55 with which molecules are depleted from the @xmath51 state using a specific mw frequency is proportional to the probability @xmath56 to find an electric field strength @xmath12 inside the trap at which the transition frequency is resonant to the applied mw frequency , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "based on the expectation that the number of molecules @xmath58 remaining in the state @xmath51 is given by @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the depletion time , our electric field distribution can be calculated via @xmath61 .",
    "we verified that the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath60 can indeed be well approximated with an exponential , validating the theoretical approach .",
    "the result of the measurement and the simulation are shown in figure  [ fig : fielddist ] for two different electric field configurations .",
    "our measurements have been converted into the electric field distribution using the theoretical approach described above .",
    "the result fits nicely to the simulation where only a small horizontal scaling by less than 5% , attributed to inaccuracies in the simulation , is needed to overlap the two .",
    "the peak position is mainly given by the offset field due to the voltages applied to the capacitor plates .",
    "we measured ( a ) with a typical offset voltage between the capacitor plates of @xmath48{v}$ ] and ( b ) with @xmath49{v}$ ] .",
    "the resulting fwhm is roughly at a peak position of in ( a ) and at in ( b ) , corresponding to a relative width of 12% and 4% , respectively .",
    "this shows that the electric field is homogeneous in a large fraction of the trap volume .",
    "in addition to the low homogeneous field also higher electric fields for trapping are present in the trap . these trapping fields lead to the long tail of the distribution .",
    "this long tail has consequences for the ability to resolve single transitions in any of our experiments .",
    "in particular , transitions which would be separated by hundreds of mhz in the homogeneous field region are stark shifted into resonance . even though the driving rate of such transitions is substantially supressed , the residual driving can still cause unwanted effects .",
    "an analysis of the consequences based on rates is provided in section  [ sec : rates ] .",
    "the excellent agreement of the measurement and the simulation shows that our electric field distribution is well understood .",
    "in particular it proves that we indeed drive the single mw transition @xmath50 as shape and peak position of the spectrum scale with trap voltages as expected . note that in figure  [ fig : fielddist ] the measured distribution lies below the simulation at higher fields .",

    "we have to consider whether there are other transitions close to the ones that we want to drive .",
    "we then have to compare the frequency separations to our spectral resolution .",

    "here , we present a detailed analysis for the mw transitions @xmath68 and @xmath69 as well as for the ir q - branch transitions from the @xmath43 and @xmath44 states used for our depletion schemes as shown in figure  [ fig : schemes ] .    ir transition frequencies of the @xmath42 vibrational mode are provided in  @xcite and were verified via saturated absorption spectroscopy in a room temperature cell .",
    "the transition frequencies were determined with sub- resolution using a frequency comb .",
    "we found that luckily the q - branch ir transition from the @xmath70 state is well isolated , with the closest relevant transition from a different state being several ghz away ( see figure  [ fig : irspectrum ] ) .",
    "our spectral resolution is clearly better than this and thus the driving of this transition is @xmath3 and @xmath4 selective .",
    "the ir transition from the @xmath71 state is less isolated . here , within several ghz",
    "we find also the ir transitions from the @xmath72 states and @xmath73 states .",
    "however , inside our trap , these states are in sum populated by at most a few percent and can therefore be neglected . despite the fact that both transitions can be regarded as being perfectly @xmath4 and @xmath3 selective ,",
    "resolving @xmath0 is not possible while using the q - branch .",
    "the stark shifts of the vibrational excited states are almost the same as in the ground state and therefore the stark shift does not lead to a separation of transitions with different @xmath0 quantum numbers .",
    "the mw transition frequencies between neighboring rotational @xmath4-states differ by at least for different @xmath4 .",
    "thus an unintended addressing of states with other @xmath4 can be excluded , and driving mw transitions can be considered as being perfectly @xmath4 selective . to find out whether the driving of mw transitions can also resolve the @xmath3 and @xmath0 quantum numbers",
    ", we calculate all transition frequencies between the rotational states @xmath74 according to equations  [ eq : rot ] and  [ eq : starkshift ] , using the typical electric field value of the homogeneous field region in our trap .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : kvalues](a ) .",
    "a comparison of the frequency differences and our electric field distribution ( section  [ sec : limit ] ) shows that it is not possible to fully resolve the @xmath3 or the @xmath0 quantum numbers .",
    "the rate at which the non - addressed transitions are driven and the consequences for the state selectivity will be analyzed in the next section .",
    "we similarly calculated the transition frequencies between the rotational states @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : kvalues](b ) ) .",
    "here at least some of the transitions between states with @xmath76 are better separated from the frequencies of the @xmath41 transitions .",
    "we therefore expect that states with @xmath76 are less affected than states with @xmath77 when addressing the states @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "to quantify the dynamics of our depletion techniques we have set up rate models .",
    "these rate models allow us to analyze the timescales of depletion of the states of interest with @xmath41 and of unwanted states with @xmath80 .",
    "in addition we include population transfer caused by blackbody radiation and discuss its effect on the depletion signal .    for our entire analysis",
    "we ignore coherent processes and study the population transfer using the rate equations .",
    "this assumption can be validated by the experimental parameters : the mw rate is at most on the order of hundreds of and has to be compared to the stark broadening in the central trap region of many .",
    "the argument for the infrared radiation is slightly different .",
    "although the laser intensity might locally be high enough to drive coherent processes , the molecules pass the small laser beam only once in a while in our large trapping volume .",
    "the rate equations have the usual form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the population in state @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the rate for driving a transition from a state @xmath83 to a state @xmath85 .",
    "we have to take several contributions into account : rotational states coupled with mw , vibrational transitions driven via the laser , the spontaneous decay from the vibrational excited states , and blackbody induced driving .",
    "unlike for the spontaneous decay and the blackbody induced population transfer the driving of the mw and ir transitions depends on the applied power .",
    "the appropriate rates for the model are determined as follows : for ir transitions , the driving rate is much faster than any other relevant processes in the trap and in particular it is much faster than the spontaneous decay rate of .",

    "two components influence the rate @xmath86 with which a rotational transition from state @xmath83 to state @xmath85 is driven : the wanted driving of this transition in the homogeneous field region of the trap ( if applicable ) and the unwanted driving of this transition in the inhomogeneous electric field regions due to the other applied mw frequencies needed for mwd or ird .",
    "for both processes the rate can be calculated with the following assumptions .",
    "we consider applying a single fixed mw frequency @xmath87 , which does not necessarily match the transition frequency from state @xmath83 to state @xmath85 in the homogeneous electric field region .",
    "first of all , the rate @xmath86 is then proportional to the effective driving power @xmath88 of the applied mw frequency .",
    "second , it is proportional to @xmath89 , the square of the clebsch gordan coefficient for transitions between state @xmath83 and state @xmath85 .",
    "third , the rate @xmath86 is proportional to the spectral line shape function @xmath90 of the given transition .",
    "this can be written in terms of a coefficient @xmath91 for the differential stark shift of the transition and the electric field distribution @xmath56 as follows .",
    "with @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the electric field where the transition takes place , we have @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath39 denotes the transition frequency in the absence of any electric fields .",
    "the rate @xmath86 for the single mw frequency is thus given by @xmath95 to obtain the total rate with which the rotational transition from state @xmath83 to state @xmath85 is driven , the contributions for the various applied mw frequencies have to be summed up .",
    "in addition to the coupling matrix @xmath55 , the initial state distribution inside our electric trap is needed .",
    "the thermal population of rotational states in our liquid - nitrogen cooled nozzle can be calculated using maxwell - boltzmann statistics as no external fields are present .",
    "however , the population in the electric quadrupole guide differs as the trapping force depends on the molecular state , and the maxwell - boltzmann distribution has to be weighted with the stark shift squared  @xcite .",
    "the resulting population distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] .",

    "population transfer caused by blackbody radiation influences the dynamics of a state detection via depletion .",
    "this population transfer leads to a repopulation of states during the depletion and thus to an enhanced number of depleted molecules .",
    "the effect of blackbody radiation can then only be neglected if the timescale for repopulation is much slower than the depletion .    in the past",
    ", the effect of blackbody radiation on molecular states was associated with blackbody induced driving of rotational transitions  @xcite .",
    "our molecule , however , has a relatively small rotational constant @xmath8 and thus blackbody induced transitions between rotational states can be neglected . for transitions between vibrational states the transition strengths for",
    "various vibrational modes of a molecule can vary over a large range and each vibrational mode has to be considered individually .",
    "indeed , the @xmath98 cf - stretch vibration in @xmath1 lies at @xmath99{cm^{-1}}$ ] and has a spontaneous decay rate of about  @xcite . at room temperature",
    "this leads to blackbody rate of @xmath100{hz}$ ] , which is relevant on the timescales of our experiments ( see following sections ) .",
    "note that only dipole allowed transitions contribute and can therefore only lead to a change of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 values with @xmath3 being conserved .",
    "the experimental implementation of mwd in the states with @xmath101 , @xmath41 involves seven frequencies ( see figure  [ fig : schemes ] ) , and an efficient depletion can be achieved by driving the corresponding seven transitions with an equal rate .",
    "based on equation  [ eq : gamma ] , we hence choose the relative power of the mw frequencies according to @xmath102 , which in our experiment is implemented by variation of the duty cycle ( see section  [ sec : exp ] ) .",
    "for example , to drive the @xmath103 transition with the same rate as the @xmath104 transition , an about 80 times higher mw power is needed .",
    "figure  [ fig : rate](a ) shows the result of the rate model for mwd of the rotational states with @xmath101 , @xmath41 .",
    "note that the absolute timescale is arbitrary as it purely depends on the total applied mw power .",
    "the timescale is chosen to match to the experimental data in section  [ sec : results.sat ] .",
    "as can be seen immediately , we deplete states with @xmath105 and @xmath41 on almost the same timescale and it is thus impossible to obtain a @xmath106 dependent mwd depletion signal . by including population transfer caused by blackbody radiation ( section  [ sec : limit.bb ] ) we observe an increase of the population with @xmath18 ( dashed black curve ) on long timescales .",
    "we repeated the analysis for mwd of the @xmath78 , @xmath41 states and the result is given in figure  [ fig : rate](b ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : rate](c ) shows the results of the ird rate model .",
    "in contrast to mwd the timescale for depletion is not given by the power of the ir or mw radiation but set by the spontaneous decay rate of the vibrational excited state .",
    "after about all molecules of the @xmath101 , @xmath41 manifold are depleted .",
    "compared to mwd , ird uses only four mw transitions .",
    "these transitions have small differential stark shifts and large clebsch gordan coefficients and thus need a relatively low mw power to be driven at a faster rate than the spontaneous decay .",
    "thus states with @xmath105 are still depleted but on a much slower timescale than for mwd . as a result",
    ", the moderate increase of depleted molecules on long timescales is here unlike for mwd not only given by repopulation of the states due to blackbody radiation but also by the slow depletion of states with @xmath80 .      in section  [ sec : scheme.m ]",
    "we discussed schemes for a detection of a single @xmath0 state using a modification of ird and mwd .",
    "we now analyze these schemes for the @xmath51 states using the rate model .",
    "both methods rely on the capability to switch off the driving of the @xmath50 transition . using the rate models we are now able to test whether it is possible to deplete all molecules within the states described by @xmath101 , @xmath41 apart from the @xmath51 state .",
    "figure  [ fig : rate ] shows the result of an mwd  ( d ) and an ird  ( e ) simulation where the coupling of the @xmath50 transition is not applied .",
    "the results presented in ( d ) show that for mwd the @xmath51 state is depleted at a similar rate as the rest of the @xmath101 , @xmath41 states and thus a single @xmath0 detection is not possible .",
    "this is primarily due to the high power needed to drive the @xmath112 transition , as mentioned above .",
    "in contrast , using ird , the detection of the population of the single @xmath0 state @xmath51 is possible and was in fact used to measure our electric field distribution in section  [ sec : limit ] .",
    "the population of the @xmath51 state is still depleted but on a much slower timescale , resulting in an error of the population measurement .",
    "blackbody radiation causes the unwanted loss of population from the single @xmath0-substate to further increase .",
    "in the following we discuss experimental results for our state sensitive detection methods mwd and ird .",
    "first , measurements of the depletion time dependence are presented .",
    "these saturation measurements yield the timescale needed for depletion which can then be compared to other timescales such as the population transfer caused by blackbody radiation or the trap lifetime .",
    "in addition , we find that the predictions from the rate model ( see section  [ sec : rates ] ) agree well with the measurement results , explaining the effect of blackbody radiation and unwanted depletion of wrong @xmath3-states . for both problems we discuss solutions in the following section .",
    "in particular we show that with a variation of ird a detection signal can be obtained which is independent of the depletion in wrong @xmath3-states .    knowing the relevant timescales we subsequently investigate the quality of our depletion techniques : we first examine to which extent our methods yield the same result .",
    "second , we prove that all molecules populating the states of interest can be depleted .    as a final result",
    "we measure the population of the @xmath51 state achieving the main goal of our rotational state detection : detecting a single rotational state described by single @xmath2 and @xmath0 quantum numbers . a time dependent saturation measurement is used to estimate the error of our single @xmath0-substate detection .",
    "all saturation measurements were performed with a similar experimental sequence as described in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "the state sensitive depletion is applied for varying amounts of time after the first second of storage .",
    "the total storage time , however , is always the same ( for mwd ; for ird ) to allow us to ignore trap losses .",
    "states in ( a ) and the @xmath113 states in ( b ) .",
    "both measurements show two timescales .",
    "the fast increase in ( a ) is given by the depletion of the entire @xmath101 states , including also the unintended depletion of states with @xmath105 .",
    "the slow increase results from blackbody induced population transfer , see main text for details .",
    "( b ) shows the same behavior except for a more pronounced slow increase .",
    "in addition to blackbody induced population transfer , this is due to the slow depletion of states with @xmath108 . ]",
    "mwd is implemented according to the scheme discussed in section  [ sec : scheme.mwd ] with the experimental details for our rotational states of interest given in figure  [ fig : schemes ] .",
    "the result of the saturation measurement and the rate model for the @xmath101 , @xmath41 states are presented in figure  [ fig : mwd](a ) and show an excellent agreement . to fit the rate model to the data we only used two fit parameters :",
    "the first one is the total power of the microwaves .",
    "this is a single fit parameter as the effective power of the individual applied mw frequencies is set according to @xmath114 ( see section  [ sec : rates.mwd ] ) .",
    "the second one is a simple vertical scaling parameter .",
    "the saturation measurement shows two timescales , as expected from the rate model .",
    "the fast increase is the depletion of the @xmath101 states , where the unwanted @xmath105 states are depleted almost equally fast as the @xmath41 states of interest .",
    "a better separation can only be achieved with an even better trap design .",
    "thus signal contributions due to the @xmath105 states are at the moment only limited by the population of these states .",
    "a calculation of the population distribution inside our electric quadrupole guide loaded from a liquid - nitrogen cooled thermal source at shows that 72% of the molecules in the @xmath101 manifold populate the @xmath41 state ( see figure  [ fig : dist ] ) .",
    "thus using mwd the measured number of molecules populating states with @xmath101 @xmath41 is at most overestimated by 40% .",
    "the slow increase in figure  [ fig : mwd](a ) is a result of blackbody induced population transfer . whereas the timescale for the depletion via mwd is purely limited by the total mw power ,",
    "the timescale of blackbody induced population transfer is given by the temperature of the setup .",
    "thus the timescales of both processes are independent and a sufficient separation is achievable .    the saturation measurement can now be used to choose the depletion time for state sensitive detection . while measuring the full saturation curve gives additional information , measuring only a single point is sufficient for many purposes and requires substantially fewer measurements .",
    "we hereby have to find a compromise : on the one hand , too long depletion times lead to larger errors due to the population transfer caused by blackbody radiation . on the other hand , the depletion of the states of interest should be saturated .",
    "we picked for further measurements . here",
    "the influence of blackbody radiation on the detection result is on the order of a few percent and thus almost negligible .",
    "a mwd measurement of the population within the @xmath113 state and the corresponding rate model is shown in figure  [ fig : mwd](b ) .",
    "the overall shape of the curve is similar to the one in figure  [ fig : mwd](a ) and again agrees nicely with the rate model .",
    "however , compared to figure  [ fig : mwd](a ) ,  ( b ) shows a much more pronounced increase at longer depletion times .",
    "this is because in the manifold of states with @xmath78 only about 40% of the molecules populate the states with @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , as discussed in section  [ sec : rates ] , the states with @xmath108 contribute on top of the blackbody radiation to the slow increase of the signal .",
    "the error for detecting states with @xmath41 is here larger than for the @xmath101 states , and mwd should only be used to discriminate the total angular momentum @xmath4 .      , @xmath41 according to the scheme shown in figure  [ fig : schemes ] .",
    "the red triangles represent a reference measurement , without applying the laser .",
    "the difference of the two ( black circles ) yields a @xmath106-selective ird measurement as explained in the main text .",
    "( b )  ird saturation of the states with @xmath115 and @xmath41 .",
    "the difference of the full ird signal ( blue ) and the measurement with the laser only applied to the @xmath43 state ( green ) yields the @xmath3-selective signal of molecules populating the states with @xmath78 and @xmath41 . ]    the rate model and the experimental result of the saturation measurement for the states with @xmath101 , @xmath41 using ird is given in figure  [ fig : ird](a ) .",
    "the implementation is realized according to the scheme discussed in section  [ sec : scheme.ird ] with experimental details given in figure  [ fig : schemes ] .",
    "this leads to the blue curve ( blue diamonds ) which is in good agreement with our rate model .",
    "we denote this method full ird in contrast to @xmath3-selective ird described below .    as already discussed above ,",
    "the driving of the infrared transitions is @xmath4 and @xmath3 selective and the unwanted depletion of states with @xmath105 is purely caused by the mw radiation .",
    "this timescale is however much slower than the depletion of the states with @xmath41 ( see section  [ sec : rates ] ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to mwd , the unintended depletion of states with @xmath105 also contributes to the slow increase of the depletion signal , which is of great advantage : by picking again of depletion for further experiments , the detection signal is less influenced by the unintended depletion of states with @xmath105 , thus reducing the error .",
    "this error can completely be eliminated by subtracting out the influence of the mw radiation .",
    "for that , we examined the depletion effect of the microwaves with a reference measurement . here the four mw frequencies for ird were applied but the laser was left off ( [ fig : ird](a ) red triangles ) .",
    "as both measurements ( the full ird and reference measurement ) are equally affected by the unintended depletion of states with @xmath80 , the difference of both measurements yields a @xmath106-selective measurement ( black circles ) .",
    "the drawback of this @xmath3-selective ird is a slightly reduced signal as the reference measurement also includes some depletion of states with @xmath41 .",
    "our ird scheme can easily be extended to incorporate also the @xmath78 rotational states as presented in section  [ sec : exp.scheme ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : ird](b ) shows the corresponding rate model and saturation measurement .",
    "the full ird signal for depleting the @xmath116 states is given by the blue curve ( blue circles ) .",
    "in addition , we can deduce the population in the states @xmath113 by performing a second measurement without driving the vibrational excitation from @xmath44 ( green triangles ) . this leads to the depletion of the @xmath101 , @xmath41 states as in ( a ) .",
    "however , the mw couplings of the @xmath78 , @xmath41 states are additionally present .",
    "thus , the effect of driving other @xmath3 states with microwaves is contained in this measurement , and the difference of both measurements in  ( b ) gives a @xmath106-selective signal for the molecule number in the states @xmath113 .",
    "-selective ird applied to a warm ensemble in our trap where other @xmath4 and @xmath3 states are present .",

    "first , we compare the number of molecules detected in the @xmath54 and the @xmath116 states using either mwd or ird .",
    "we use an ensemble directly loaded from the electric quadrupole guide closely matching the rotational state distribution shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] .",
    "the molecules are stored for and either the depletion or nothing is applied during the last .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison](a ) the resulting state selected signal of molecules is plotted for each method , satisfying our expectations from the previous discussions .",
    "in particular we see that the @xmath106-selective ird measurement always results in the lowest signal as this methods underestimates the number of molecules in the states of interest .",
    "in contrast , mwd and full ird overestimate the signal where the effect is stronger for mwd than for ird due to the enhanced depletion of states with @xmath80 .",
    "all three methods differ less for the depletion of the states with @xmath101 than for the states with @xmath115 as the contribution of @xmath80 is stronger for @xmath78 than for @xmath101 .    to verify that we can deplete all molecules within a certain set of states we use an almost pure state ensemble produced by sisyphus cooling . due to the long trapping time during cooling , a reduced trap voltage for unloading , and the rf knife for cooling , almost only the cooled molecules ( ) in the @xmath54 states",
    "are unloaded for detection at the end of the cooling sequence  @xcite . however , some molecules are pumped to the @xmath78 states due to blackbody radiation .",
    "in addition , a fermi resonance with a double excited vibrational state can also lead to population of the @xmath44 state .",
    "we thus expect most of the molecules to populate the @xmath54 states and some the @xmath113 states . to test our state sensitive detection methods we used this cold ensemble .",
    "the depletion was applied to the @xmath117 states for to ensure full saturation .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison](b ) shows the outcome of this measurement . here , both methods , mwd and full ird , give the same result which is almost equivalent to the total signal of trapped molecules .",
    "we can therefore state that the depletion transfers all molecules populating the states of interest to untrapped states .",
    "a shorter depletion time leads to some error , however , already for two seconds of depletion this can most often be ignored .",
    "we additionally used the sisyphus - cooled ensemble to compare the @xmath106-selective ird measurement with mwd and full ird , as states with @xmath80 are hardly populated .",
    "we detected the population of the @xmath54 states with for depletion .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison](c ) shows that the @xmath3-selective ird measurement underestimates the signal by less than 5% compared to mwd and full ird .",
    "the figure shows two saturation measurements .",
    "the red circles corresponds to an ird measurement .",
    "the black dots are measured without driving the transition @xmath50 .",
    "the difference of the two measurements yields a measure for the number of molecules in the @xmath51 state . due to the stark broadening of our spectral lines ,",
    "the @xmath50 transition is slightly driven by the other applied microwave frequencies .",
    "measuring only at a single point with of depletion therefore underestimates the number of molecules in the @xmath51 state as is explained in the main text . ]    in this section , we discuss the experimental results of a single @xmath0-substate detection using the scheme presented in section  [ sec : scheme.m ] .",
    "as we have seen in section  [ sec : rates ] , the scheme with ird is expected to work and was in fact already used to measure our electric field distribution .",
    "here we again perform saturation measurements to obtain an estimation of the error of our single @xmath0-substate detection .    to improve statistics we used an ensemble cooled to ( cf . section  [ sec : limit ] .",
    "afterwards , the population was distributed among the @xmath118 states . for the following the molecules",
    "were stored , and we performed an ird saturation measurement either with driving the @xmath50 mw transition or without . to improve the quality of our single state detection we reduced the mw power by about a factor of eight compared to the ird measurements described above .",
    "note that the laser is left on during the whole .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdet ] shows a clear difference in the signals .",
    "the measurement with applying the @xmath50 coupling ( red circles ) is equivalent to the full ird signal ( except for the reduced mw power ) .",
    "the measurement without ( black dots ) has to be separated into two regions : the fast increase yields the depletion signal of all molecules populating the @xmath54 states except the population of the @xmath51 state .",
    "the subsequent slower increase is caused by the unintended driving of the @xmath50 transition in the inhomogeneous electric field regions as well as by blackbody induced population transfer .",
    "the difference of both measurements yields a signal proportional to the number of molecules in the state @xmath51 and thus the population of a state described by a single @xmath2 and @xmath0 quantum number .",
    "due to the unintended depletion of the @xmath51 state in the black curve , this difference underestimates the population in the state @xmath51 . to obtain an estimation of the error we fitted the black data points with a double exponential ( blue , dashed ) .",
    "the slow part of this fit is plotted ( solid green ) and the difference of the fully saturated red curve and the extrapolation of the green curve to yields the signal of molecules in the @xmath51 state .",
    "the fast increase saturates after about , meaning that the entire population of all states but the @xmath51 state is depleted .",
    "for of single state detection we thus underestimate the number of molecules by approximately 20% .",
    "this measurement shows that we can clearly distinguish between the @xmath51 state and the other states in the @xmath54 manifold .",
    "the @xmath119 state can be detected with a similar scheme .",
    "the mw coupling stays the same but the vibrational driving is on the @xmath45 states which has two consequences : first , the vibrational decay transfers population to the @xmath44 state .",
    "thus mwd or ird for depleting the @xmath44 state is additionally needed .",
    "second , the spontaneous decay from the vibrational excited state @xmath120 transfers population to the target state @xmath119 with a branching ratio of 5% which gives an additional error of the measurement .",
    "in summary , we have presented a detailed investigation of rotational state detection of trapped molecules based on depletion , driving rotational and vibrational transitions to transfer molecules to untrapped states . as suitable transitions",
    "can be found in any molecule , our technique is extremely general and should be applicable to all trappable molecule species .",
    "moreover , with use of only a single microwave synthesizer and ( optionally ) a single infrared laser , our technique is simple to implement .",
    "an extension to other types of internal states is feasible .",
    "detecting hyperfine states would require a sufficient spectral resolution , and detecting vibrational states could make use of different rotational constants in different states .",
