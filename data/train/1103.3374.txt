    "hydrogen inside the b@xmath1 cluster migrating to the most stable configuration only has to overcome a barrier energy of @xmath29  ev .",
    "this small value indicates that hydrogen atoms will sit covalently bonded to the outside of isolated b@xmath1 clusters .",
    "we next consider @xmath0-boron . for the following discussion",
    "we follow the nomenclature to describe inter - cage bonding adopted by @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ inter - layer bonds are referred to as 2-center ( 2c ) bonds , intra - layer bonds as 3-center ( 3c ) bonds ( see figure [ hinalphapic ] ) .",
    "it should not be confused with the nomenclature developed for boron - hydrogen molecular compounds by lipscomb _",
    "et al _ @xcite , notably their chemical two- and three - center bonds refer to the number of boron atoms involved in chemical bonding , rather than the topology of the boron cage lattice as in our case .    using a rhombohedral supercell we calculated lattice parameters to be @xmath30 and @xmath31  and b - b bond lengths for the b@xmath1 icosahedra of @xmath32  with inter - icosahedral two - center bonds ( 2c ) @xmath33  and three - center bonds ( 3c ) @xmath34  .",

    "the volume of the triclinic cell is 0.09 % smaller than the rhombohedral , and the total energy of the cell is 0.0106  ev lower .",
    "we therefore used the triclinic cell for all subsequent implantation calculations .",

    "[ hinalphapic],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    ( b )    a single neutral h atom was then added at different sites and the structures optimised again , this time with fixed lattice parameters . for h@xmath2 four stable sites ( a - d ) were found ,",
    "as shown in figure [ hinalphapic]a , b . in site",
    "a the h atom is located near a 2c - bond with bond lengths @xmath43  and @xmath44  . in site b the h atom sits centered over a boron triangle of 3c - bonds between the icosahedra ( @xmath45  ) .",
    "site c is near site b , but the h atom lies directly over a 3c - bond between two icosahedra ( @xmath46  for both ) . as for isolated b@xmath1 we also found a much less stable metastable site within the b@xmath1 cage ( see table [ hinalpha ] ) , position d ( @xmath47  for all three ) , where the hydrogen lies near a boron triangle pointing towards a 2c - bond .",
    "when placed in other sites within the b@xmath1 icosahedron ( including the center site ) the hydrogen moves to more stable locations outside the icosahedron without any energy barrier .",
    "the energy barriers to move between site d and either site a or b ( table [ barr ] ) are very small ( 0.13  ev and 0.09  ev respectively ) , and thus as for the isolated b@xmath1 , h will not remain within the cage except possibly at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "this is in agreement with recent calculations for much higher hydrogen densities ( 1 per b@xmath1 ) @xcite , although we find a different final stable location outside the cage . as well as",
    "the space at icosahedra centers the @xmath0-boron lattice also has an interstitial void space between the b@xmath1 layers ( see figure [ hinalphapic ] ) , however once again hydrogen is expected to be metastable here and will displace to more stable neighbouring bond sites .",

    "our results for the @xmath0-phase allow us to speculate on hydrogen behaviour in the more complex @xmath6-boron phase .",
    "@xmath6-boron has no equivalents of the @xmath0-boron 3c bond triangles , however bonds with similar lengths to the 2c- and 3c- bonds exist .",
    "thus we would expect no equivalent of the b , b@xmath49 and b@xmath4 sites for hydrogen , and the most stable sites are likely instead to be similar to a ( 2c - bonds ) or c ( 3c - bonds ) .",
    "this agrees with results from implantation of positive muonium into @xmath6-boron @xcite .",
    "we can also suppose that h will not sit within the b@xmath1 icosahedra in the @xmath6-boron phase .",
    "unlike @xmath0-boron there are also some under - coordinated partial vacancy sites likely to trap hydrogen , and given the larger connected void spaces we assume h@xmath5 migration will have a significantly lower barrier .",
    "+ table [ tab : h2 ] shows that hydrogen within the @xmath50boron lattice is less stable than isolated gas phase h@xmath5 .",
    "thus hydrogen incorporation within the lattice will only occur through kinetic restrictions , i.e. if hydrogen becomes trapped in the lattice , either during growth or through implanation , and is then not able to escape . since @xmath51boron has larger void spaces we assume that h@xmath5 will be more stable in the @xmath51boron void sites .",
    "thus the presence of significant quantities of hydrogen within the @xmath50boron lattice may serve to destabilise it with respect to the less dense @xmath51boron phase . this may be a contributing factor to the observed difficulty in synthesising @xmath50boron , as well as the @xmath52boron phase transition ( we note that molecular hydrogen in other crystalline semiconductors such as silicon is often difficult to identify ) .",
    "thus we have now a first picture of hydrogen behaviour in pristine @xmath0-boron . at low densities",
    "h atoms will form a reservoir of h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 ions in the inter - icosahedral space , resulting in a charge neutral crystal .",
    "once these become mobile , either through thermal activation or via excitation into highly mobile metastable h@xmath2 , they will diffuse together , creating interstitial molecular h@xmath5 .",
    "this will remain trapped in interstitial void spaces until at very high temperatures when it will diffuse out .",
    "these results suggests that hydrogen doping of boron will be difficult and probably only possible through ion implantation rather than gas phase impregnation and thus @xmath0-boron is unlikely to serve as a useful hydrogen storage material .",
    "there may also be the possibility of h diffusion and resultant h@xmath5 formation at very low temperatures due to quantum tunnelling .",
