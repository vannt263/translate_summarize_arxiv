    "galaxies and clusters of galaxies formed when gravitational instability amplified density fluctuations in the expanding cosmological background universe .",
    "regions denser than average eventually stopped expanding and recollapsed to form virialized objects .",
    "the question of what equilibrium structure results when a density perturbation collapses out of the expanding background universe and virializes is central to the theory of galaxy formation .",
    "the nonlinear outcome of the growth of gaussian - random - noise cosmological density fluctuations due to gravitational instability in a hierarchical clustering model like cdm is not amenable to direct analytical solution , however . instead",
    ", numerical simulations are required . as a guide to understanding these simulations , as a check on their accuracy , and as a means of extrapolating from simulation results of limited dynamic range , analytical approximations are nevertheless an essential tool .",
    "one such tool of great utility has been the solution of the spherical top - hat perturbation problem ( e.g. peebles 1980 , padmanabhan 1993 ) . as used in the press - schechter ( `` ps '' ) approximation ( press & schechter 1974 ) and its various refinements , the top - hat model serves to predict well the number density of virialized haloes of different mass which form at different epochs in n - body simulations . an analytical model for the internal structure ( e.g. mass profile , temperature , velocity dispersion , radius ) of these virialized haloes would be a further tool of great value for the semi - analytical modelling of galaxy and cluster formation , therefore .",
    "shapiro , iliev & raga ( 1998 ; paper i ) derived such a model for an eds universe .",
    "here we shall generalize the analysis of paper i to the case of a low - density universe ( @xmath1 ) which is either matter - dominated or flat with a cosmological constant ( i.e. @xmath2 ) .",
    "we shall also describe how the tis model can be generalized to other cosmologies with a nonclumping background component , such as quintessence .",
    "it is generally assumed that the collapse to infinite density predicted by the exact , nonlinear solution of the spherical top - hat perturbation problem is interrupted by a violent relaxation to virial equilibrium at a finite density , as a result of the growth of initially small - amplitude inhomogeneities in the density distribution .",
    "earlier work adopted the crude approximation that the postcollapse object which emerges from this violent relaxation is either a uniform sphere or a singular isothermal sphere , with the same total mass and energy as the collapsing top - hat and with a radius and velocity dispersion ( or , equivalently , gas temperature ) fixed in accordance with the virial theorem .",
    "our first motivation , therefore , was simply to improve upon this earlier treatment by finding a more realistic outcome for the top - hat problem .",
    "as a starting point , we adopted the assumption that the final equilibrium is spherical , isotropic , and isothermal , a reasonable first approximation to the n - body and gasdynamic simulation results of the cdm model .",
    "the postcollapse analytical solution we derived in paper i from this assumption quantitatively reproduces many of the average properties of the haloes found in those simulations to good accuracy , so we are encouraged to believe that our approximation is well justified for haloes which form from realistic initial conditions .",
    "our model is in disagreement , however , with one detail of the n - body simulation results that , in their very centers , simulated haloes have cuspy profiles ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; `` nfw '' ) .",
    "by contrast , our model predicts a density profile with a small , uniform - density core , in good agreement with the observed rotation curves of dark matter  dominated galaxies ( iliev and shapiro 2001 ) and with cluster mass profiles inferred from gravitational lensing ( iliev and shapiro 2000 , shapiro and iliev 2000 ) .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the cuspy profiles of the n - body results and the observed dark matter  dominated haloes ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "1999 ) has led recently to a vigorous reexamination of the cold , collisionless nature of cdm , itself , and the suggestion that a variation of the microphysical properties of the dark matter might make it more `` collisional '' , enabling it to relax dynamically inside these haloes so as to eliminate the central cusp ( e.g. spergel & steinhardt 2000 ; burkert 2000 ; dav et al .",
    "2000 , firmani et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "while the details of this suggestion are still uncertain , our model can also be applied in that case , to the extent that we are able to ignore the details of the relaxation process inside the halo and approximate the final equilibrium as isothermal .",
    "as described in paper i , our model is as follows : an initial top - hat density perturbation collapses and virializes , which leads to a truncated nonsingular isothermal sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium ( tis ) , a solution of the isothermal lane - emden equation .",
    "although the mass and total energy of the top - hat are conserved thru collapse and virialization , and the postcollapse temperature is set by the virial theorem ( including the effect of a finite boundary pressure ) , the solution is not uniquely determined by these requirements alone . in order to find a unique solution , some additional information is required .",
    "we adopted the anzatz that the solution selected by nature is the `` minimum - energy solution '' such that the boundary pressure is that for which the conserved top - hat energy is the minimum possible for an isothermal sphere of fixed mass within a finite truncation radius .",
    "this assumption fixes the ratio of the radius of the postcollapse sphere to the radius of the top - hat perturbation which created it , as measured at the latter s epoch of maximum expansion , uniquely . for comparison",
    ", we appealed to the details of the exact , self - similar , spherical , cosmological infall solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) . in this solution",
    ", an initial overdensity causes a continuous sequence of spherical shells of cold matter , both pressure - free dark matter and baryonic fluid , centered on the overdensity , to slow their expansion , turn around and recollapse .",
    "the baryonic infall is halted by a strong accretion shock , while density caustics form in the collisionless dark matter , instead , due to shell - crossing .",
    "the postcollapse , virialized object we wish to model is then identified with the spherical region of shell - crossing dark matter and shock - bounded baryonic fluid in this infall solution ( for ratio of specific heats @xmath3 ) for which the mass is the same as that of our top - hat and the trajectory of its outermost spherical mass shell was identical to that of the outer boundary of our collapsing top - hat at all times until it encountered the shock . according to the detailed similarity solution for this infall problem , this spherical region of post - shock gas and shell - crossing dark matter ,",
    "it turns out , is very close to hydrostatic and isothermal and has virtually the same radius as that of the minimum - energy solution for the matching tis .",
    "this offers some support for our `` minimum - energy '' anzatz and explains the dynamical origin of the boundary pressure as that which results from thermalizing the kinetic energy of infall .    with this `` minimum - energy '' anzatz",
    ", we found that top - hat perturbation collapse leads to a unique , nonsingular tis , which yields a universal , self - similar density profile for the postcollapse equilibrium of virialized cosmological haloes .",
    "our solution has a unique length scale and amplitude set by the top - hat mass and collapse epoch , with a density at every point which is proportional to the background density at that epoch .",
    "the density profiles for gas and dark matter are assumed to be the same ( no bias ) .",
    "the final virialized halo has a small but flat - density core . for the eds case ,",
    "this core radius @xmath4 is about 1/30 of the total size @xmath5 of the halo ( i.e. the truncation radius ) .",

    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath13 of the dark matter and the gas temperature @xmath14 are given simply by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean gas mass per gas particle .",
    "this temperature is significantly different from that predicted by the standard uniform sphere ( sus ) and singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) approximations adopted previously in the literature , with @xmath17 .    the derived mass profile of our tis solution as a function of its virial temperature ( or velocity dispersion ) and its formation epoch reproduces to remarkably high accuracy ( i.e. of order 1% ) the cluster mass - radius - temperature relationships and average mass profile for cdm haloes which evrard , metzler , and navarro ( 1996 ) derived empirically by fitting a large set of detailed numerical gas dynamical and n - body simulation results of cluster formation in the cdm model .",
    "the tis and nfw halo mass profiles are also in very close agreement ( fractional deviation of less than @xmath18 ) at all radii outside of a few tis core radii ( i.e. about one king radius ) for nfw concentration parameters @xmath19 . in short ,",
    "our tis model is in good agreement with the average properties of simulated cdm haloes although it differs from these numerical results at very small radii .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the results of paper i to the case of a low - density universe , either open and matter - dominated ( @xmath1 , @xmath20 ) , or flat with cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) . in the former case",
    ", the internal structure of the tis haloes will be the same as for the eds results of paper i , when radius and density are expressed in dimensionless terms in units of the core radius and central density",
    ". however , these latter dimensional quantities will be functions of the total mass and the formation epoch of the halo , functions which differ from the eds results and depend upon the value of @xmath21 .",

    "however , the differences with respect to the eds solution are much more extensive . in this case , not only is it necessary to consider the differences which result from the different solution for the spherical top - hat problem , but it is also necessary to take proper account of nonzero @xmath22 in the virial theorem , the conservation of energy , and the isothermal lane - emden equation , as well . in ",

    "finally , in view of the suggestive physical correspondence between our tis solution in the eds case and the shock- and caustic - bounded sphere in the self - similar , spherical infall solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) , we have added an appendix  [ appendix1 ] in which we show how the latter solution ( for an eds universe ) can also be applied at early times in the generalized low - density universe cases described here , by a simple rescaling of parameters .",
    "the spherical top - hat model , an uncompensated spherical perturbation of uniform overdensity within a finite radius ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , affords considerable insight into the dynamics of the gravitational growth of cosmic structure , while still having an exact , analytical or semi - analytical solution ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) . in what follows",

    "since @xmath202 for any @xmath203 , the temperature @xmath197 is always higher than @xmath204 , the standard value for a uniform sphere shown in equation ( [ temp_low ] ) .",
    "just as we did in paper i , we identify the virial radius @xmath71 with the size of the truncated isothermal sphere ( i.e. @xmath205 ) . for comparisons with the results of dynamical calculations of the formation of such an equilibrium object",
    ", we should interpret @xmath71 ( and @xmath5 ) as the radius inside which hydrostatic equilibrium holds ( e.g. cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "hereafter , we specialize the discussion to the case in which the x - component is the cosmological constant .",
    "the virialized object which results from the collapse of a given top - hat density perturbation must have the mass of the top - hat before it collapsed and virialized .",
    "we assume that the total energy @xmath94 is also conserved , including the effect the cosmological constant has on the potential energy , if present . fixing the mass @xmath85 and the energy @xmath94 of the tis which results from the collapse of the top - hat , however , is not enough to specify which member of the infinite family of solutions of the modified isothermal lane - emden equation which all share this mass and energy is chosen by the collapsing top - hat . in order to make a unique choice , some additional information is required , such as the value of the boundary pressure @xmath206 . as in paper",
    "i , we shall assume that the correct boundary pressure @xmath206 is that value which makes the tis with this total energy @xmath94 and mass @xmath85 correspond to the unique minimum - energy solution .",
    "in order to determine the minimum - energy tis which results from a given top - hat collapse , we must take account of the fact that this top - hat collapse depends upon the value of the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "this parameter measures the relative importance of the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant and the rest - mass energy density of the matter inside the top - hat at maximum expansion , which is different for different epochs of maximum expansion even for a given value of the cosmological constant . as a result ,",
    "the internal structure of the tis solution which results from a given top - hat collapse even when expressed in dimensionless form with radius in units of @xmath4 and density in units of @xmath8 will depend , not only upon the background cosmology parameters ( i.e. @xmath2 and @xmath207 ) , but also upon @xmath67 for the top - hat .",
    "this makes the calculation of our minimum - energy tis solution in this case more complicated than for the eds case in paper i.    as in paper i , this conservation of the energy @xmath94 of the top - hat before and after its collapse and virialization assumes that there is no extra @xmath208-work that needs to be taken into account due to the presence of the external boundary pressure @xmath206 which would otherwise alter the final total energy @xmath94 compared with its initial value before collapse .",
    "this is appropriate for the case at hand , since the collapse prior to the epoch of virialization is that of a cold , pressure - free gas which collapses supersonically . as in the well - known , self - similar , spherical infall solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) , the original energy is converted from potential energy at maximum expansion to a mixture of infall kinetic energy and potential energy during infall , with a negligible share of the energy going into compressional heating . in that solution ,",
    "the infall is halted by a strong shock . at this shock",
    ", the kinetic energy of infall is converted primarily into the thermal energy of the shock - compressed gas , with only a small portion remaining as kinetic energy of subsonic , postshock infall .",
    "while the self - similar infall solution is strictly correct only for the eds universe , we expect similar behaviour in low density universes , as well .",
    "however , since no general self - similar infall solution exists in these cases , the analogous infall solution for low - density universes must be studied by numerical means .",
    "of course , in the limit of high redshift , the self - similar solution of the eds case can be applied even to the case of a low - density universe if properly rescaled ( see appendix  [ appendix1 ] ) . by analogy with this infall solution , therefore , we identify the boundary pressure @xmath206 in the case of our tis solution , not as a fixed external pressure which acts on the top - hat boundary throughout its collapse and virialization , but rather as something like the instantaneous post - shock pressure in the infall solution . as such , it has a physical origin in the conversion of the original energy of the collapsing top - hat , itself , from potential energy at maximum expansion into kinetic energy of infall during collapse and , finally , into thermal energy of the post - shock gas , always conserving the original energy @xmath94 of the top - hat .",
    "as shown above , the truncated isothermal sphere solutions form a one - parameter family , described by @xmath178  the truncation radius in units of the core radius .",
    "specifying @xmath209 , the total mass , and the total energy completely determines the solution .",
    "alternatively , we can specify the mass , the total energy and the applied external pressure @xmath206 .",
    "the conservation of energy equates the energy after collapse and virialization to the energy of the top - hat at maximum expansion , @xmath210 .",
    "this yields @xmath211 where @xmath212 in dimensionless variables , equation ( [ en_conserv ] ) becomes @xmath213 where @xmath214 and we have used the fact that @xmath215 for a given external pressure @xmath206 , the total energy of the modified isothermal lane - emden sphere is given by @xmath216 where @xmath217 we have plotted the dependence of the dimensionless total energy @xmath218 on @xmath209 in figure [ energy_plot_low ] for several representative values of the parameter @xmath107 . in order to indicate the dependence of the size of the sphere on @xmath209 , we can nondimensionalize the radius @xmath5 , according to @xmath219 this definition of @xmath220 also corresponds to the familiar dimensionless energy parameter used in discussions of the stability of isothermal spheres .    for a given mass @xmath85 and external pressure @xmath206 ,",
    "the solution is specified uniquely only if we can uniquely identify a special value of @xmath209 , or equivalently , of @xmath94 .",
    "apparently , for any truncated isothermal sphere of mass @xmath85 which is confined by a given external pressure @xmath206 , there is a unique value of @xmath209 which minimizes the total energy @xmath94 . as in paper",
    "i , we shall make the reasonable anzatz that this minimum - energy solution is the unique tis solution preferred in nature as the outcome of the virialization of the sphere in the presence of a fixed external pressure .",
    "we offered evidence to support this anzatz in paper i. it is possible that this is a general result for any tis formed by relaxation in the presence of a fixed external pressure , but we are only concerned here with spheres that evolve from cosmological initial conditions .    for each value of @xmath107 in the allowed range @xmath221 , the minimum value of @xmath94 as a function of @xmath209 for a given @xmath206 is found by minimizing the dimensionless energy @xmath222 in equation ( [ e_nond ] ) , with @xmath223 found by solving equation  ( [ en_conserv_nond ] ) . unlike the eds case discussed in paper i , the minimum - energy solution in a low - density universe is not universal ( except for the special case @xmath119 ) , but instead depends upon the time of collapse , as implicitly parameterized by the quantity @xmath107 .",
    "this makes our calculation of the solution more complicated than in paper i , since equation  ( [ nondim_sph_low ] ) depends upon @xmath170 and must , therefore , be solved in conjunction with equation  ( [ rho_lam ] ) to obtain a self - consistent solution and , subsequently , to find the minimum - energy point .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ energy_plot_low ] , the minimum of the energy corresponds in each curve to a unique value of the dimensionless truncation radius @xmath209 and becomes more pronounced when the cosmological constant contribution is more important .",
    "the value of @xmath209 at which this minimum energy occurs increases with increasing @xmath170 , from @xmath224 for matter - dominated models ( @xmath225 ) to @xmath226 for @xmath201 , the maximum allowed value .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath209 , @xmath227 , @xmath223 , @xmath228 , @xmath170 , and @xmath229 versus @xmath107 are shown in figure  [ 6panel ] .",
    "the point @xmath225 corresponds to the solution for matter - dominated models without cosmological constant ( either open or flat ) , where these dimensionless quantities are identical to those for the eds case obtained in paper i.    thus far , we have derived the unique , dimensionless minimum - energy tis solution for the postcollapse virialized object which results from top - hat collapse at any epoch for different cosmologies , as parameterized by the value of @xmath99 , the ratio of the vacuum energy density to the matter rest - mass energy density of the top - hat at its epoch of maximum expansion . in order to complete the dimensionless description of the tis model for the postcollapse equilibrium object created by a top - hat which collapses at a given redshift @xmath67 , it is necessary to relate @xmath107 to @xmath67 , according to the solution of the nonlinear top - hat perturbation equation  ( [ delta_gen_low ] ) [ or ( [ delta_open ] ) ] .",
    "this dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath67 for the top - hat perturbation was described in   [ top_low_dens ] above .",

    "these values of the parameter @xmath107 were chosen to correspond to the eds case and open - matter - dominated cases ( @xmath225 ) , and to the flat , @xmath22-dominated model currently favoured by astronomical observations , with @xmath230 , for different collapse epochs : @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) , @xmath233 ( @xmath234 ) , and @xmath235 ( @xmath236 ) , as well as for the extreme cases of @xmath237 , @xmath235 ( @xmath238 ) , and of either @xmath239 or else @xmath240 ( i.e. in the future ) ( @xmath201 ) .",
