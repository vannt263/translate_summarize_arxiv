    "hydrodynamic stability is typically studied by the method of linearisation and subsequent modal analysis  @xcite .",
    "this approach considers the asymptotic behaviour of small perturbations to a steady or time - periodic base flow .",
    "such asymptotic behaviour is determined by the eigenvalues of a linear operator arising from the analysis , describing the time - evolution of the eigenmodes .",
    "many canonical problems , such as flow in a channel , permit such stability analysis to be performed about a velocity field which depends on a single coordinate .",
    "however in more complex geometries we can extend the classical hydrodynamic stability analysis to use fully resolved computational stability analysis of the flow field @xcite .",
    "this is referred to as _ biglobal stability analysis _",
    "@xcite or _ direct linear stability analysis _ in analogy to direct numerical simulation ( dns ) .",
    "this approach is able to resolve fully the base flow in two or three dimensions and to perform a stability analysis with respect to perturbations in two or three dimensions .",
    "this methodology does not need to resort to any approximations beyond the initial linearisation and the imposition of inflow and outflow conditions .",
    "in particular the biglobal stability analysis method allows us to consider flows with rapid streamwise variation in two spatial dimensions such as the case of interest , flow over a low pressure turbine blade . by postulating spanwise homogeneous modal instabilities of the form : @xmath0",
    ", asymptotic instability analysis becomes a large scale eigenvalue problem for the modal shape @xmath1 and eigenvalue @xmath2 .",
    "this permits use of algorithms and numerical techniques which provide the leading eigenvalues and eigenmodes for the resulting large problems , typically through iterative techniques such as the arnoldi method  @xcite .",
    "this approach is extremely effective at determining absolute instabilities in many complex geometry flows , both open and closed  @xcite including weakly nonlinear stability @xcite .",
    "direct linear stability analysis has not been routinely applied to convective instabilities that commonly arise in open domain problems with inflow and outflow conditions .",
    "one reason is that such flows are not typically dominated by modal behaviour , but rather by significant growth of transients that can arise owing to the non - normality of the eigenmodes .",
    "a large - scale eigenvalue analysis is not designed to detect such behaviour , although for streamwise - periodic flow , it is possible to analyse convective instability through direct linear stability analysis  @xcite .",
    "to examine this situation , hydrodynamic stability analysis has been extended to cover non - modal stability analysis or transient growth analysis  @xcite .",
    "this approach poses an initial value problem to find the linear growth of infinitesimal perturbations over a prescribed finite time interval .",
    "much of the initial focus in this area has been on large linear transient amplification and the relationship of this to subcritical transition to turbulence in plane shear flows  @xcite .",
    "this approach was recently employed in backward - facing - step flows  @xcite . with different emphasis from the present approach ,",
    "ehrenstein & gallaire  @xcite have directly computed modes in boundary - layer flow to analyze transient growth associated with convective instability and hpffner  _ et  al _",
    "@xcite investigated the transient growth of boundary layer streaks . a comparable study to the present work @xcite , studied steady and periodic flows past a cylinder .",
    "a preliminary study along the lines of the current work , concentrating on a steady base flow , is described in @xcite .",
    "methods developed for direct linear stability analysis of the navier  stokes   equations in general geometries have been previously described in detail  @xcite , and extensively applied @xcite .",
    "subsequently , large - scale techniques have been extended to the transient growth problem . in @xcite a method suitable for such direct optimal growth computations for the linearized navier  stokes  equations in general geometries was described in detail .",
    "the extension to periodic base flows was presented in @xcite , for the case of a stenotic / constricted pipe flow .",
    "the approach has been applied to steady flows past a low pressure turbine blades @xcite , a backward facing step @xcite and a cylinder , @xcite , and is the method adopted in this study .",
    "recent work @xcite on the flow past the same t-106/300 low - pressure turbine blade ( lpt ) as used in this study , concentrated on a biglobal stability analysis in order to understand the instability mechanisms in this class of flows . at a reynolds number of 2000 ,",
    "the base flow displays periodic shedding .",
    "the work imposed periodic boundary conditions which imply synchronous shedding from all blades .",
    "relevant to the current study , the work found that these periodic boundary conditions caused the marginally stable flow to go very marginally unstable ( floquet multiplier @xmath3 just over @xmath4 ) at a reynolds number of 2000 and spanwise wavelengths @xmath5 of approximately @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the projection of the chord length on the streamwise axis .",
    "this instability is understood to be due to strict enforcement of the periodic boundary conditions , which is arguably not physical .",
    "relaxing the strict periodicity by using a double - bladed mesh resulted in stable eigenmodes ( @xmath9 ) for all reynold numbers explored , presumably because small subharmonic effects were sufficient to supress synchronous shedding and allow asynchronous shedding .",
    "the same geometry is analysed here . for our purposes ,",
    "the flow is best characterised as marginally unstable with floquet multiplier ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this work highlights that modal analysis with secondary instabilities does not explain transition in this flow .",
    "abdessemed et al @xcite also considered the transient growth problem using a steady base flow at a reynolds number of 895 , where significant transient growth up to order @xmath11 was observed .",
    "the present study extends this to periodic base flow at a higher reynolds number of 2000 , where the base flow is periodic .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we outline the direct stability analysis method and the direct transient growth analysis needed to determine the peak growth and the associated perturbations . in section [ sec : results ] we present results for transient growth about a periodic base flow , considering in turn variation by spanwise wavelength , period and starting point in the base flow phase .",
    "the flow over the blade is governed by the incompressible navier  stokes   equations , written in non - dimensional form as    [ eq : fullnse ] @xmath12 @xmath13    where @xmath14(x , y , z , t)$ ] is the velocity field , @xmath15 is the kinematic ( or modified ) pressure field and @xmath16 is the flow domain illustrated in figure  [ fig : mesh ] . in what follows",
    "we define reynolds number as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the inflow velocity magnitude , @xmath8 the projection of the axial blade chord on the streamwise axis , and @xmath19 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "thus , we non - dimensionalise using @xmath8 as the length scale , @xmath18 as a velocity scale , so the time scale is then @xmath20 . in the present work",
    "all numerical computations of the base flows , whose two and three - dimensional energy growth characteristics we are interested in , will exploit the homogeneity in @xmath21 and require only a two - dimensional  computational domain .",

    "the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath24 in the base flow equations are uniform velocity @xmath25 at the inflow , fully developed ( @xmath26 ) at the outflow , periodic connectivity at the lower and upper boundaries and no - slip conditions at the blade surface .",
    "our interest is in the evolution of infinitesimal perturbations @xmath27 to the base flows .",
    "the linearized navier  stokes  equations governing these perturbations are found by substituting @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pressure perturbation , into the navier  stokesequations and keeping the lowest order ( linear ) terms in @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting equations are    [ eq : pert_full ] @xmath31 @xmath32    these equations are to be solved subject to appropriate initial conditions and the boundary conditions .",
    "the initial condition is an arbitrary incompressible flow which we denote by @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 . the boundary conditions we consider are homogeneous dirichlet on all boundaries , _ i.e.  _ @xmath35 . as discussed in @xcite , such homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions",
    "simplify the treatment of the adjoint problem because they lead to corresponding homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on the adjoint fields .",
    "we note that the action of equations ( [ eq : pert_full ] ) ( a ) and ( b ) on an initial perturbation @xmath36 over time interval @xmath37 may be stated as @xmath38      the modal decomposition of this forward evolution operator @xmath39 determines the asymptotic stability of the base flow @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the solution is proposed to be the sum of eigenmodes , @xmath41 and we obtain the eigenvalue problem @xmath42    since for the case of interest @xmath40 is @xmath43-periodic , we set @xmath44 and consider this as a temporal floquet problem , in which case the @xmath45 are floquet multipliers and the eigenmodes of @xmath39 are the @xmath43-periodic floquet modes @xmath46 evaluated at a specific temporal phase .",
    "our primary interest is in the energy growth of perturbations over an arbitrary time interval , @xmath37 .",
    "we treat @xmath37 and @xmath47 as parameters to be varied in this study . as is conventional @xcite we define transient growth with respect to the energy norm of the perturbation flow , derived from the @xmath48 inner product @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the kinetic energy per unit mass of a perturbation , integrated over the full domain .",
    "the transient energy growth over interval @xmath37 is @xmath51 where we introduce @xmath52 , the adjoint of the forward evolution operator in .",

    "although the initial disturbance also involves separation at the shear layer and a disturbance at the trailing edge , the initial disturbance extends further up the blade surface .",
    "figure [ fig : t01.00,lz01.95,t00,3d ] shows iso - surfaces of streamwise vorticity at @xmath101 of the same mode combined with @xmath102 the base flow .    , for @xmath44 , at zero initial phase , showing spanwise vorticity .",

    "an investigation was also carried out to find the effects on the maximum attainable growth of varying this initial phase . at short growth horizons @xmath37 ,",
    "the growth achieved is only weakly dependent on @xmath5 and is achieved just before @xmath105 as can be seen in figure [ fig : t0_surfs ] .",
    "furthermore the figure also shows the dependence on initial phase remains weak over a range of integration times @xmath37 .",
    "we conclude from the figure that the dependence of growth on the initial phase @xmath47 is relatively unimportant .",
    "the relevant previous study @xcite demonstrated that although subharmonic effects were small , they were sufficient to induce asynchronous shedding and prevented the flow from going unstable .",
    "for the present problem we do not consider the asymptotic or long - time behaviour of perturbations but their behaviour over a shorter time horizon .",
    "results for the double - bladed mesh were tested for times up to eight shedding periods and agree well with the single blade situation . at these longer times ,",
    "consideration of the least stable eigenmode would be more suitable .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that subharmonic effects are relatively unimportant in the transient growth problem and the assumed periodic boundary condition is a valid means to reduce the computational domain for the problem under study .",
    "the transient behaviour of perturbations to linearised flow past a periodic array of t-106/300 low pressure turbine fan blade was investigated .",
    "the analysis was carried out at a reynolds number of 2000 associated with periodic vortex shedding , used as a periodic base flow .",
    "it is known from asymptotic analysis @xcite , the flow past an array of these turbine blades is marginally stable .",
    "the current analysis shows that long wavelength optimal perturbations associated with long time integration periods convect far downstream and eventually align with the asymtotically least stable eigenmode .",
    "the discovery of converging optimum growth for long integration times confirms the lack of a strong asymptotic instability .",
    "it is found that the long - wavelength perturbations tend toward a purely two - dimensional case and that these perturbations are associated to maximum optimum growth in the asymptotic case approached by long time - integration .",
    "however , as we already know from two - dimensional dns , the two - dimensional baseflow is stable for nonlinear flows and therefore also stable in a linear sense .",
    "it therefore may be assumed that the identified optimum growth associated to long wavelength perturbations is less significant than perturbations that are limited in spanwise wavelength . when considering short integration times it is indeed found that short - wavelength perturbations are of higher significance .",
    "short integration times have maximum optimal growth at shorter spanwise wavelengths and convect only a short distance downstream , exciting the near wake .",
    "we might hypothesise that in the presence of the neglected nonlinearity , the associated optimum modes cause shear layer separation , triggering wake instability .",
    "this would have to be demonstrated in a full nonlinear dns .",
    "furthermore , the spanwise length of a real lpt blade is naturally limited , giving an additional reason why short wavelength perturbation are more important than long wavelength disturbances of theoretical spanwise extent .",
    "our results are consistent with the understanding that transient growth mechanisms are associated with shear in the base flow feeding the perturbation energy growth .",
    "the results presented are consistent therefore with the cylinder results reported in the literature ( both on transient growth mechanisms @xcite and on receptivity via the adjoint @xcite ) and with the previous work on the lpt fan blade used in this study @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that the understanding developed will prove useful in controlling laminar boundary layer separation with a view to improving performance .",
    "for instance , the spatially periodic pattern in the shear layer can be quantified in the time - domain indicating disturbance frequencies susceptible to optimum amplification .",
