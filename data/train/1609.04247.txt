    "as is well known , domain walls could be created in the universe if / when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "an interesting example of this kind was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where the idea of spontaneous @xmath6 violation was put forward .",
    "however , in the simplest version this mechanism encounters serious cosmological problems because even a single domain wall inside the present day cosmological horizon would strongly distort the observed isotropy of cmb  @xcite . to cure this cosmological disaster a few mechanisms of wall destruction",
    "were proposed  @xcite . in our recent paper  @xcite we explored the idea of spontaneous @xmath6 violation to construct a ( nearly ) baryo - symmetric cosmology which might be compatible with observations .",
    "according to this scenario domains with opposite signs of @xmath6 violation appeared during inflation and survived at the stage of reheating when the baryogenesis operated .",
    "later the walls between these domains dissolved and therefore the domain wall problem did not arise . as a result ,",
    "this model could lead to baryo - symmetric universe with cosmologically large regions of matter and antimatter",
    ". some general features of such dynamical @xmath6 violation are described in refs  @xcite .    for successful implementation of such cosmological model it is imperative that the distance between the matter - antimatter domains is also cosmologically large .",
    "it could be realized if the width of the domain wall which existed during baryogenesis was cosmologically large ( we understand by the domain wall the piece of space between two regions in the universe , where the field has not yet relaxed to its equilibrium value , though the double minimum in the potential has already disappeared ) .",
    "the matter - antimatter domains should be separated by at least several megaparsec in terms of the present day scale to avoid excessive matter - antimatter annihilation . on the other hand",
    ", the distance should not be too large , otherwise the scenario would lead to too large angular fluctuations of cmb  @xcite .",
    "it means in particular , that domains with opposite @xmath6 symmetry breaking must be created during inflationary stage , otherwise both the size of matter - antimatter domains and the transition regions between them would be too small .",
    "in contrast , baryogenesis must proceed after inflation was over to avoid strong dilution of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the evolution of the domain walls in de sitter space - time was considered by basu and vilenkin  @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that the width of the domain wall is determined by the ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter , which was assumed to be constant , @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs - like field which induced the spontaneous symmetry breaking , and @xmath10 is the coupling constant in the double - well potential , see . if @xmath11 , the width of the domain wall would be close to its flat space - time value , @xmath12 , which is microscopically small , because @xmath13 is essentially the mass of the higgs - like boson . to create astronomically wide domain wall",
    "this boson must be practically massless and thus it would generate long range forces most probably excluded or strongly restricted by experiment .    on the other hand , if @xmath14 , it is not excluded that the width of the domain wall may be astronomically large . in presented paper",
    "we show that this is indeed the case . in ref .",
    "@xcite only the stationary problem was considered , when the shape of the domain wall was a function of a single variable , @xmath15 , which is the length interval in de sitter space . in this case",
    "the equation of motion is reduced to an ordinary differential equation which makes the problem much simpler technically . in the paper  @xcite",
    "it was found numerically that the stationary solution exists only if @xmath16 .    in what follows we lift the assumption of the stationarity and",
    "consider the general plane solution being a function of both variables : the distance from the wall and time .",
    "it allows us to see how the solution approaches the stationary one and , in particular , what happens with initial configurations if @xmath17 , when the stationary solution does not exist .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : stationary ]",
    "we reproduce the calculation of basu and vilenkin  @xcite and provide a simple explanation why the critical point is at @xmath18 . in section  [ sec : evolution ] we consider the field evolution with respect to both time and coordinate .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "in spatially flat section of de sitter universe the expansion rate , @xmath19 , is constant and the scale factor evolves as @xmath20 .",
    "the flrw metric for such universe has the form : @xmath21    let us consider a model of real scalar field @xmath22 with the lagrangian @xmath23    the corresponding equation of motion is @xmath24    in flat space - time , @xmath25 , and in one - dimensional static case , @xmath26 , the equation takes the form @xmath27 and has a kink - type solution , which describes a static infinite domain wall . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the wall is situated at @xmath28 in @xmath29-plane : @xmath30 where @xmath12 has the meaning of the wall thickness ( subscript @xmath31 indicates that @xmath25 ) .",
    "now let us consider an expanding universe with constant @xmath32 . in this case ,",
    "if one looks for stationary solution , it is reasonable to suggest that the field @xmath22 depends only on @xmath33 , which is the proper distance from the wall .",
    "so , one can choose the following ansatz for @xmath22 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are dimensionless .    with this ansatz the second independent variable , i.e. time @xmath37",
    ", does not enter into the equation of motion which takes the form : @xmath38 here prime means the derivative with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "it is noteworthy that all parameters of the problem are combined into a single positive constant @xmath39",
    ".    since we are interested in kink - type solutions , the boundary conditions should be @xmath40    corresponding numerical solutions for different values of parameter @xmath41 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bv_all ] .",
    "they are in good agreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . is presented , but it is mistakenly labelled as @xmath42 . ]",
    "we see that the larger is @xmath41 the closer is the solution to the flat space - time one ( @xmath25 ) , as is naturally expected .",
    "stationary field configurations @xmath43 for different values of parameter @xmath41.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    as it is noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite the stationary solutions can be found only for @xmath16 , but no explanation of this observation is given therein .",
    "let us try to explain why the value @xmath18 is the special one .    from eq .",
    "( [ bv_eq ] ) and condition @xmath44 it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "using this condition and expanding @xmath43 into taylor series near @xmath46 , one obtains that for sufficiently small positive @xmath47 and for @xmath48 : @xmath49    in other words , if the function @xmath43 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ bv_eq ] ) and the boundary conditions are @xmath44 and @xmath48 , then @xmath43 is convex for @xmath16 and small positive @xmath35 , like ordinary kink - type solution is .",
    "however , for @xmath17 the function @xmath43 is concave , therefore it can not be the kink - type one .",
    "so this is a simple explanation why in the case @xmath17 there are no stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ bv_eq ] ) with boundary conditions  ( [ bound_cond ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we allow for an arbitrary dependence of the solution on @xmath50 and @xmath37 , it exists for any @xmath41 , but the case of @xmath17 leads to the expanding kink with rising width , as it is shown in the next section .    a more formal proof that there are no stable solutions for @xmath17 can be found in appendix [ sec : appendix_proof ] .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , eq .",
    "( [ bv_eq ] ) allows to find the field configurations , which describe stationary domain walls in expanding universe .",
    "however , it is also interesting to see how domain walls evolve from some initial states . beyond the stationary approximation we can find not only solution for @xmath16 but also for @xmath51 , for which the stationary approximation does not exist .",
    "to this end one should solve the original equation of motion  ( [ eq_of_mot ] ) in the case when the field @xmath22 is a function of two independent variables , @xmath50 and @xmath37 : @xmath52    it is convenient to introduce dimensionless variables @xmath53 , @xmath54 and function @xmath55 . as a result one obtains the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 as it was above .",
    "the boundary conditions for the kink - type solution should be @xmath58 and we choose the initial configuration as the domain wall with  natural  thickness @xmath59 ( with respect to dimensionless coordinate @xmath60 ) and zero time derivative : @xmath61    of course , this is a toy model with the artificial initial conditions .",
    "the realistic model should describe the evolution of domain walls from the very beginning , including the process of wall formation .",
    "this will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we analyze solutions of eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) starting from large values of parameter @xmath41 gradually moving to smaller ones .",
    "the evolution of the domain wall for @xmath62 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : c4 ] .",
    "the stationary solution is shown there by black curve ( it is denoted by `` bv '' because of basu and vilenkin who found it in ref .",
    "one sees that the domain wall evolves from the initial state  ( [ in_cond1 ] ) in somewhat non - trivial way . at the very beginning",
    "the wall starts to broaden in terms of the proper distance from the wall , @xmath63 , and at some moment it becomes wider than the stationary solution .",
    "however , afterwards the wall broadening changes to contraction , here it occurs approximately at @xmath64 ( but such `` beautiful '' value of @xmath37 seems to be accidental ) .",
    "finally , the wall comes to the stationary configuration after several damped oscillations around it .",
    "the oscillating behavior is expected because the field equation  ( [ evolution ] ) is the oscillator type equation with respect to @xmath65 and the value of the first time derivative is chosen arbitrarily .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness ] the time dependence of the physical width of the wall in dimensionless units , @xmath66 , for different values of @xmath41 is presented . in the left plot ( @xmath16 )",
    "one can see that all the curves indeed tend to constant values corresponding to stationary solutions ( dashed lines ) .",
    "oscillatory behavior mentioned above is also apparent .",
    "right plot contains curves for @xmath67 . along the vertical axis",
    "the wall thickness is shown in logarithmic scale in order to compare the rate of the wall expansion with the exponential cosmological one .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath68 , i.e. for not very small values of @xmath41 , the wall thickness increases slower than exponent .",
    "however , for smaller values of @xmath41 , e.g. @xmath69 the rate of the wall expansion is the exponential one with a good accuracy .",
    "the hubble constant , @xmath8 , plays the role of friction in this problem and when it dominates over the potential term ( @xmath70 ) , the field configuration as a function of coordinates becomes almost static .",
    "therefore the width of the wall is growing nearly as the scale factor @xmath71 , i.e. almost exponentially .",
    "this is why there are no stable solutions for @xmath70 .",
    "time evolution of thick domain walls in a de sitter universe is considered .",
    "we have shown that for large values of parameter @xmath16 the initial kink configuration in a de sitter background tends to the stationary solution obtained by basu and vilenkin  @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed the bv result that the width of the stationary wall rises with decreasing value of @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath67 the stationary solution does not exist and the width of the wall infinitely grows with time . for @xmath72",
    "the rise is close to the exponential one within the precision of our numerical calculations .",
    "this result confirms the assertion made in ref .",
    "@xcite that the transition region between matter and antimatter domain might be cosmologically large .",
    "this result is essential for application of spontaneous breaking of symmetry between particles and antiparticles to realistic cosmology . in our version of this scenario",
    "@xcite the walls between matter and antimatter domains dissolved and hence the huge energy density of domain walls , which was a stumbling block of the traditional approach , did not destroy isotropy and homogeneity of the universe .",
    "baryogenesis in our model proceeded after the double well potential returned to the  normal  potential with the single minimum at @xmath73 ( here @xmath74 is field which made the wall ) .",
    "correspondingly the field @xmath74 started to move from the initial values @xmath75 to zero , so the domain walls disappeared .",
    "however , if the classical field @xmath74 did not completely relax down to zero prior to baryogenesis , it would induce @xmath6-violation of different signs at different domains which in turn led to an excess of matter or antimatter in this remnants of the regions with non - zero @xmath74 .",
    "a necessary condition to make this model realistic is a sufficiently large distance between matter and antimatter domains .",
    "otherwise the annihilation on the boundaries would create too high gamma ray background , according to ref .",
    "the calculations presented above demonstrate that there is some range of the parameter values , namely @xmath76 , for which the width of the domain wall exponentially rises and so the distance between matter and antimatter could be large enough .",
    "on the other hand , too wide domain walls lead to large universe regions devoid of baryons , so it might distort the observed quasi - isotropy of cmb at the angular distance above the diffusion ( silk ) damping scale .",
    "however , this statement can be questioned , since the temperature contrast between baryon / antibaryon and empty regions might push the domains apart diminishing the baryon - antibaryon diffusion towards each other and this would allow for smaller separation between the domains below the diffusion damping scale .",
    "the latter problem is under investigation now .    * note added . * after this paper was submitted to journal , we were informed about the paper @xcite , where the related problems were considered .",

    "let us assume that equation ( [ bv_eq ] ) @xmath77 with the boundary conditions ( [ bound_cond ] ) @xmath78 has a solution @xmath43 .",
    "we suppose that there is only one zero of this solution : @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "this assumption looks rather natural but we have not proven it . if this is still true , then due to the symmetry of eq .",
