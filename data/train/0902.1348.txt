    "there are experiments underway to identify wimps in collider experiments ( e.g. , the lhc @xcite ) or by their annihilation productions throughout the galaxy @xcite , although it will be challenging to conclusively determine wimp properties . in the case of collider experiments",
    ", wimps can not be directly observed , and mapping any anomalous interactions to a particular theory will be difficult .",

    "@xcite , this latter population may have a profound impact on predictions for direct detection event rates and on the annihilation rate of wimps captured in the earth .    in order to characterize the bound wimp population ,",
    "we have undertaken a program of simulating wimp orbits in the solar system , taking into account the possibility of further scattering in the sun .",
    "the results from our simulations in a toy solar system consisting of jupiter on a circular orbit about the sun are described in a series of three papers , of which this is the last . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we simulated a population of wimps bound to the solar system by elastic scattering in the sun , a population originally postulated by @xcite .",
    "we found that the df of this population depended on both the wimp mass and the strength of the wimp - baryon interaction , but that the population was too small to significantly enhance direct detection event rates or to produce an observable signature of wimp annihilation in the earth .",
    "however , in paper ii of the series @xcite , we found that the extended lifetime of wimps captured in the sun had interesting consequences for searches for wimp annihilation in the sun .",
    "both the gravitational interactions between wimps and planets and finite optical depth in the sun to wimps altered the standard picture that all wimps captured in the sun immediately thermalize .",
    "these modifications to the standard thermalization pictured imply lower annihilation rates of wimps in the sun for @xmath9 tev or for low elastic scattering cross sections .      in this paper , paper iii",
    ", we present simulations of the orbits of another class of bound wimps : those captured in the solar system by gravitational interactions with the planets .",
    "previous work on this population has relied on treating all wimp - planet encounters as local , and with only a crude treatment of wimp - baryon encounters in the sun . in order to make comparisons with our simulations",
    ", we briefly outline the previous work on the gravitationally bound wimp population .    the first to estimate the size of the gravitationally",
    "bound wimp population was gould @xcite .",
    "gould approximated all encounters between planets and wimps as local ; gravitational scatters do not change the wimp speed with respect to the planet , but do change the orientation of the orbit .",
    "this translates to a change in velocity in the heliocentric frame , and hence , to changes in the wimp energy and angular momentum . using a random walk approach",
    ", gould found the average time for the angle between the direction of wimp velocity with respect to the planet and the direction of motion of the planet to change by order unity as a function of wimp speed , the `` angular diffusion '' timescale .",
    "he interpreted this as the timescale on which the planets could move wimps in or out of a particular region of phase space , since whether a wimp is bound or unbound to the solar system depends on the direction of the wimp velocity in a planet - centric frame with respect to the planet motion .",
    "gould then estimated the df of wimps at the earth using the following detailed balance approximation .    assuming that galactic halo wimps can be treated as having a maxwellian df near the solar system , and that the galactic dark matter halo is non - rotating in an inertial galactocentric frame , the df of low speed wimps ( ones that may be captured gravitationally ) is nearly constant , @xmath10 . since the escape speed from the solar system at the position of the planets is small",
    ", the phase space density of halo wimps at each planet is also @xmath11 .",
    "gould argued that if the angular diffusion timescale were less than the age of the solar system , the phase space density of bound orbits should be the same as the phase space density of the unbound halo wimps for a given wimp speed in an inertial frame moving with the planet .",
    "the flow of wimps filling the bound phase space is countered by the flow of wimps becoming unbound to the solar system .",
    "the angular diffusion timescale associated with jupiter is of order myr for any part of phase space accessible to jupiter . in gould",
    "s picture , the phase space corresponding to bound jupiter - crossing wimps should have the same density as the phase space associated with unbound orbits .",
    "furthermore , gould found that the timescale associated with the earth and venus for speeds with respect to the earth of @xmath12 was less than the age of the solar system .",
    "thus , for such speeds , the wimp phase space density should be the same for any orientation of the velocity vector in an inertial frame moving with the earth ( geocentric ) .",
    "some parts of phase space for @xmath13 is empty in this picture , but the majority of the accessible phase space at those speeds corresponds to unbound or jupiter - crossing orbits .",
    "hence , the speed distribution of wimps at the earth in a frame moving with the earth should be identical to the speed distribution of halo wimps in free space ( outside the potential well of the sun ) for @xmath12 .",
    "gould found that the free space approximation was reasonable for larger speeds , too .",
    "gould neglected wimp - nucleus scattering in the sun . to determine the importance of this effect , @xcite also treated wimp - planet encounters as local , and solved a gravitational diffusion equation for wimp orbits in a solar system consisting of jupiter , the earth , and venus .",
    "the sun was either treated as a point mass or as infinitely optically thick to wimps .",
    "the timescale for hitting the sun was estimated using a small set of individual wimp orbit simulations .",
    "they found that the df for wimps if the sun were infinitely optically thick to wimps was substantially smaller than if the sun were a point mass .      in light of previous work on gravitationally captured wimps ,",
    "there are several reasons to perform suites of wimp orbit simulations .",
    "first , the work of @xcite suggests that scattering in the sun is an important loss mechanism for bound wimps",
    ". it would be useful to understand the degree of depletion as a function of the wimp optical depth in the sun .",
    "second , both gould and lundberg & edsj \" o treat wimp - planet interactions as local .",
    "however , these treatments neglect long - range encounters , short - period interactions , and is fundamentally insensitive to resonances ( although these are incorporated for a set of earth - crossing wimps in ) , which are known to be important in determining the dynamics of the population of wimps bound to the solar system by elastic scattering in the sun ( paper i ) and of minor bodies in the solar system @xcite . finally ,",
    "since wimps tend to be captured on initially very loosely bound orbits , they may be affected by external gravitational fields , which are known to be important in shaping the oort cloud @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present simulations the gravitational capture and evolution of wimps in the solar system . as in paper",
    "i , we simulate orbits in a toy model solar system consisting of jupiter on a circular orbit about the sun .",
    "the reasons for using a simplified system are twofold .",
    "( i ) since the integration algorithm is new , it is useful to check its performance in a simple system .",
    "the toy system we use has a constant of motion , the jacobi constant ; its constancy throughout the simulations was an indication of the accuracy of the integration scheme .",
    "( ii ) since jupiter is by far the largest planet in the solar system , it should dominate the dynamics of wimps .",
    "these simulations provide a solid basis for understanding the dynamics of wimps in more complicated systems , which we hope to simulate in the future .",
    "we describe the simulations in section [ sec : simulations ] , and present the resulting dfs in section [ sec : df ] , which we construct using a method outlined in appendix [ sec : df_estimator ] . in that section",
    ", we also discuss the df in context of solar depletion and galactic gravitational fields .",
    "we show the direct detection and neutrino telescope event rates from the gravitationally bound wimp population in sections [ sec : dd ] and [ sec : id ] . in each of those sections",
    ", we compare the event rates from gravitationally captured wimps to the population of wimps bound to the solar system by elastic scattering in the sun , the subject of paper i. in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the our results in context of other work .",
    "the key points of this work are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "simulations were performed using the algorithm described in paper i , which we briefly summarize here .    for most of the wimp path , we integrated the orbits using a symplectic integrator optimized for systems in which one body dominates the gravitational potential of the system , and for which the gravitational force does not deviate significantly from an inverse square law @xcite .",
    "symplectic integration is desired for long - term orbit integrations because errors are oscillatory instead of growing with time .",
    "this particular symplectic integrator is efficient for integrating the highly eccentric orbits characteristic of wimps because it allow for variable time steps ( short at perihelion , long near aphelion ) . to achieve this in a symplectic way",
    ", it treats time @xmath14 and the wimp energy @xmath15 as conjugate variables ; each step in time @xmath16 is related to a step in the new fictitious time coordinate @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the wimp position and momentum coordinates , respectively . for the choice @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational potential , @xcite show that the integrator exactly traces the solution to the two - body problem with only a phase error . since typically @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the position of the sun , @xmath25 , so that for fixed @xmath17 , shorter time steps are taken at perihelion than aphelion .",
    "we integrate the eight - dimensional equations of motion using a second - order leapfrog mapping using a fixed fictitious time step @xmath26 .",
    "we use only a second order integrator because we are interested in the behavior of an ensemble of orbits , and not the precise orbits of individual wimps . even for this low order mapping",
    ", there is no numerical precession of orbits , and errors in the hamiltonian are oscillatory in nature .",
    "although it would be ideal use the symplectic integrator with fixed fictitious time step @xmath27 throughout the integrations , it is too time consuming to be practical .",
    "this is because the integrator is not optimized to handle potentials that deviate significantly from @xmath28 , which is the case in the interior of the sun or when wimps experience close encounters with planets . in those cases",
    ", @xmath27 would need to be set prohibitively small in order to resolve those potentials .    instead , we treat passages through the sun and close encounters with planets using alternate methods , which allows for @xmath27 to be set to a reasonably large value . while this breaks the hamiltonian flow of the symplectic scheme , we have taken care to insure that our methods for treating the special cases minimize errors in the hamiltonian .    for the passages through the sun , we exploit the fact that tidal forces from the planets are much smaller near the sun than they are elsewhere in the orbit . we treat passages through the sun as a two - body problem , and",
    "are able to map the coordinates of the wimp as it enters the sun to its coordinates upon exit . in paper",
    "i , we show that this method does not induce additional numerical errors .",
    "we define a sphere ( or `` bubble '' ) around each planet in which we allow another break to the symplectic algorithm described above . in this bubble",
    ", we still integrate the wimp orbits using the symplectic algorithm , but with a new fictitious time step @xmath29 tuned to achieve a minimum accuracy criterion for the hamiltonian . to find this fictitious time step ,",
    "we first integrate the wimp orbit with the fiducial @xmath27 for the region outside the planet bubble and outside the sun .",
    "if a minimum accuracy requirement @xmath30 is met , then the orbit is allowed to continue . if the minimum accuracy requirement is not met , the trajectory through the bubble is integrated with a slightly smaller @xmath29 .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the minimum accuracy requirement is met or the error plateaus .",
    "we tune the bubble size , the minimum accuracy requirement and @xmath27 to minimize the overall integration time while maintaining small oscillatory errors in the hamiltonian throughout the integration . in later sections ,",
    "we describe our specific choices for these variables .      _",
    "the solar system : _ we perform simulations of wimp orbits in a toy solar system consisting of jupiter ( ) on a circular orbit of @xmath31 the sun ( modeled using @xcite ) . this system admits a constant of motion , the jacobi constant , which is a useful check on the accuracy of the integration algorithm . for simplicity ,",
    "we treat jupiter as having a constant mass density ; this is not a realistic representation of jupiter s structure , but only a tiny percentage of simulated wimps ever go through the planet .",
    "wimp - baryon encounters in jupiter are also neglected for similar reasons ; in addition , the optical depth of jupiter to wimps is negligible compared to that in the sun . since the kinetic energy and speeds of solar nuclei are small compared to those of the wimps , we treat solar nuclei as being at rest with respect to the sun .    _",
    "dark matter : _ the scattering probability of wimps in the sun is completely determined by the solar model , the wimp mass @xmath32 , and the cross sections @xmath33 and @xmath2 . since we suspected that the bound wimp df would not strongly depend on scattering in the sun , we chose only one point in the wimp mass - cross section parameter space to use for the simulations , @xmath34 amu , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "this point lies below the best limits on wimp parameter space from direct detection experiments using standard assumptions about the halo wimp df @xcite .",
    "however , in order to extrapolate our dfs to other points in wimp parameter space , we kept track of the integrated optical depth of each wimp as a function of time .      in deciding how to arrange the initial conditions , it is useful to think about the flux of dark matter particles into a sphere of radius @xmath37 centered on the sun .",
    "the flux for an isotropic distribution function @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angle between the velocity @xmath41 and the position vector @xmath42 for incoming particles , and @xmath43 is the speed of the particle relative to the sun but far outside its gravitational sphere of influence .",
    "we have invoked liouville s theorem to find the wimp phase space density at an arbitrary distance from the sun .",
    "the total number of particles going inward through this spherical shell per unit time is @xmath44 it is useful to express this rate in terms of the specific energy @xmath45 and specific angular momentum @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . given that @xmath49 we find @xmath50 therefore , the number of particles going through any shell is independent of the radius of the shell for a given energy and angular momentum ; this is to be expected since there is no loss of particles between shells .",
    "if we were to sample all particles that flow in towards the sun , we would sample the energy according to to @xmath51 and the angular momentum to be uniform in @xmath52 .",
    "however , by restricting the range of incoming particles that are sampled to those that could be scattered onto bound orbits , we can speed up the calculation .    to find the range of @xmath45 for which particles might possibly be gravitationally scattered by jupiter onto bound orbits , it is useful to think of gravitational capture in the following way . in the frame of the planet ,",
    "the particle speed does not change during the encounter , but its direction with respect to the direction of motion of the planet does . if the particle has a velocity @xmath41 with respect to the sun before encountering jupiter , it will have an initial speed with respect to jupiter of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the velocity of jupiter with respect to the sun . after encountering jupiter",
    ", the particle will have a velocity @xmath55 with respect to jupiter and @xmath56 with respect to the sun .",
    "for particles that were barely unbound to the solar system to begin with , it takes only a tiny deflection of the orbit to bind it to the solar system .",
    "however , for particles with increasingly higher energy with respect to the sun , it takes an ever greater deflection by jupiter to bind the particle .    in order to find an upper limit to the energy from which particles",
    "may be captured , consider the most extreme encounter possible .",
    "this is the case of a particle that has a tiny impact parameter with respect to jupiter , and which has its initial velocity aligned with jupiter s direction of motion .",
    "therefore , the particle s velocity with respect to jupiter is @xmath57 where @xmath58 . the particle will be deflected through 180@xmath59 , so that @xmath60 the requirement that the particle is bound to the solar system after the scatter is equivalent to the statement @xmath61 therefore , @xmath62 or @xmath63 and so @xmath64 this corresponds to a speed outside the gravitational sphere of influence of the sun of @xmath65 no wimp with a speed far from the sun that exceeds 41 km s@xmath66 with respect to the sun can be gravitationally captured .",
    "in addition to limiting the range of @xmath45 that we sample , we can also speed up the calculation by constraining the range of @xmath52 sampled . this constraint is equivalent to specifying a range of orbital perihelia to probe , given that the perihelion @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 such that the angular momentum for a given energy @xmath45 and perihelion is described by @xmath69 the goal is to make the range of @xmath67 ( and hence , @xmath52 ) large enough to encompass all orbits that might become bound to the solar system while keeping the range small enough so as not to waste computing resources by following unnecessary orbits .",
    "we divide the gravitational scattering simulation into two parts , each defined by a different range of energy and perihelion : the `` regular run '' and the `` high perihelion run . '' the regular run samples particle orbits with : @xmath70 the maximum perihelion of 10 au was chosen to be large enough  twice the semi - major axis of jupiter  so that this run would contain the vast majority of particles that are gravitationally captured .",
    "if the regular run misses any bound orbits due to the limit on @xmath67 , those orbits should be found in the high perihelion run , defined by @xmath71    if we were to sample @xmath45 and @xmath52 according to the distribution of particle energy and angular momentum squared flowing in towards the sun , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravflux ] ) , the sampling probability would be : @xmath72           \\end{cases }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the range @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the maximum and minimum perihelia allowed in each run .",
    "these ranges describe the maximum extent of @xmath45 and @xmath52 for any given run .",
    "this sampling probability is highest in the high energy , high angular momentum part of the range considered .",
    "however , we want to sample proportionally more low energy orbits in both the regular and high perihelion runs , since these are most easily captured",
    ". we sample @xmath77 in the range @xmath73 , and uniformly sample @xmath78 .",
    "we treat the halo wimps has having a maxwellian df in galactocentric coordinates in the solar neighborhood , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the wimp speed in galactocentric coordinates , far outside the sphere of influence of the sun .",
    "@xmath81 is the local wimp number density , where the @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "we set the one - dimensional wimp velocity dispersion @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the speed of the local standard of rest @xcite . in heliocentric coordinates ,",
    "the df is @xmath85 we use the angle - average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : local_maxwell_sun ] ) to set the initial conditions .",
    "once a sample particle s orbital parameters @xmath45 and @xmath52 are selected , its initial position is determined by randomly orienting the position vector to a point on a spherical shell with fixed radius @xmath37 relative to the sun .",
    "the initial speed vector is chosen to be oriented inward , with the angle @xmath86 relative to the position vector determined by @xmath52 .",
    "the speed @xmath47 is fixed by @xmath37 and @xmath52 since @xmath87 .",
    "the azimuth of the velocity vector relative to the position vector is also randomly chosen .",
    "thus , the initial position and velocity of the particle are completely determined .      in general",
    ", we prefer to use heliocentric coordinates when integrating the equations of motion .",
    "however , the symplectic integrator breaks down at large heliocentric distances .",
    "this is because the gravitational potential in heliocentric coordinates has the form @xmath88 , \\label{eq : helio_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 denotes a planet . at large heliocentric distances , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : helio_potential ] ) , the indirect term , becomes large compared to the gravitational potential of the sun . because we want to maintain @xmath90 even at large distances from the sun , we switch to barycentric coordinates far from the sun .",
    "we use a crossover radius @xmath91 au , which is point at which the value of the indirect term from jupiter is approximately 10% the gravitational potential of the sun . we find that using substantially smaller values of @xmath92 induces large energy errors due to frequent breaks to the symplectic integration scheme .",
    "we initially set @xmath27 according to table [ tab : grav_init ] .",
    "this is sufficient for a `` first pass '' through the solar system . for long - term integrations , in order to both control errors near jupiter and to speed up integration if particles settle onto tighter orbits , we reset @xmath27 after the particles pass through the jupiter bubble .",
    "@xmath27 is actually reset at the first aphelion after passing through the bubble since we have empirically determined that this is the point in the orbit at which a change of @xmath27 causes the minimum error .",
    "we then set @xmath27 according to table [ tab : gravh ] . since the semi - major axis of an orbit can change substantially throughout the integration , it is useful to occasionally change @xmath27 to match @xmath93 , either to speed up the integration or improve accuracy .",
    "we allow @xmath27 to change after each passage through the jupiter bubble up to 10 myr ; however , to control for errors caused by breaking the symplectic nature of the integrator repeatedly , we only allow @xmath27 to be reset if the energy changes by more than @xmath94 through a jupiter bubble passage after that time .",
    "again , @xmath27 is always reset at aphelion .",
    ".the initial integration conditions for the gravitational capture simulation as a function of initial speed @xmath47 and kepler perihelion @xmath67 .",
    "the values of @xmath27 are in units of @xmath95 yr . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a caveat , only the flux of muons created outside the detector volume is calculated in darksusy .",
    "this was historically done because muon path lengths were long compared to the detector dimensions .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that muons created inside the detector volume dominate the signal for smaller wimp masses ( @xmath96 gev ) in large ( km@xmath97 ) telescopes , and that the expected event rate from muons created within the detector volume depends quite sensitively on the configuration of detectors inside that volume .",
    "therefore , the event rates used here ought to be considered a lower limit to the actual event rate in a large detector for neutralino masses @xmath96 gev . from fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrino_unbound ] , we find that the event rate of muons created in the telescope volume would need to be at least two orders of magnitude larger than the event rate of muons created outside the telescope in order to be observed",
    ". the ratio between the gravitationally bound wimp event rate and the halo event rate , however , would be unchanged in this scenario .",
    "in this section , we discuss our results in comparison with previous work on gravitationally captured wimps , namely the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , we focus on direct comparisons between our simulations and the work on the toy solar system .",
    "second , since the other authors considered the effects of planets , which we have not yet discussed in the context of the simulations , we describe what results from the toy solar system we expect will hold in the true solar system , and what we expect might change .",
    "_ toy solar system : _ first , we describe which of our results agree with previous work , and then how they disagree .",
    "our results agree with previous work in two important ways .",
    "( i ) while lundberg & edsj find that scattering in the sun may drastically reduce the wimp df in a three - planet ( jupiter , earth , venus ) solar system relative to the df if the sun were a point mass , they find that the wimp df in a one - planet ( jupiter ) solar system is largely unaffected by the details of scattering in the sun . our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grav_loss ] ) confirm their findings .",
    "( ii ) even though our bound wimp df is smaller than the detailed balance df , the two dfs are nearly identical for small geocentric wimp speeds . since the capture rate of wimps in the earth is most sensitive to the density of the lowest speed wimps , our predictions for the event rate for neutrino telescopes match those predicted using detailed balance arguments .",
    "we find several important deviations from the detailed balance picture of gould .",
    "first , we showed that angular momentum and energy diffuse at different rates in the solar system .",
    "this implied a deficit in the bound wimp df for large geocentric wimp speeds , as well as an asymmetry between the prograde and retrograde wimp dfs .",
    "second , we found a set of long - lived ( @xmath98 myr ) resonance - sticking wimps that contributed @xmath99 of the bound wimp df .",
    "since our sample was small , we were unable to determine how statistically significant that contribution was .",
    "the resonance - sticking bound wimp df depends on ( i ) the orbital properties of the wimp while stuck to a resonance , ( ii ) the distribution of wimps among resonances , and ( iii ) the lifetime distribution .",
    "the former two points will likely only be addressed in future , larger simulations .",
    "we used the lifetime distributions from studies of comets in the solar system to argue that the resonance - sticking wimp df would be at most a similar size to the total gravitationally captured bound wimp df found in this work .",
    "however , most of the work on comets was done in nearly planar systems , and with initial conditions for the comets that are quite different that the wimp initial conditions @xcite .",
    "we caution that wimp orbits in the solar system are fully three - dimensional , and that the wimp df depends not on the overall lifetime distribution of wimps in the solar system , but on the lifetime distribution of wimps _ on earth - crossing orbits_. as an aside , all of the resonance - sticking wimps were originally captured onto orbits @xmath100 au , such that none of these wimps would have contributed to the wimp df if galactic tidal fields were strong at @xmath101 . the only way to determine how important resonance - sticking is in the solar system is to perform larger simulations than those presented in this work , and incorporating a better treatment of external gravitational fields .",
    "finally , our work is the first to explore the possibility of galactic gravitational fields affecting the bound wimp df . even though our treatment of the fields is crude ( removing wimps from the inner solar system as soon as they pass outward through r = 1000 au from the sun )",
    ", it suggests that external gravitational fields may play a significant role in shaping the bound wimp distribution in the solar system .",
    "future simulations should include a more realistic treatment of the galactic gravitational fields in order to make precision predictions for the bound wimp df at the earth .",
    "the potential importance of the galactic gravitational fields brings up a shortcoming of treating all wimp - planet encounters as local .",
    "we find that the wimp df is much smaller when a crude treatment of galactic tides is used because long - range capture of barely unbound wimps is quite important , and these wimps are typically captured onto barely bound orbits . therefore , the wimp df is sensitive to the details of capture in the solar system , which are not well - described by treating all encounters between wimps and planets as strictly local .    _",
    "the effect of more planets on the df : _ our conclusions are based on simulations in a toy solar system , while the true solar system is far more complex .",
    "the question is , how will putting jupiter on a more realistic eccentric orbit and the presence of other planets alter the df ?",
    "there are several things we expect .",
    "first , we expect the asymmetry between prograde and retrograde orbits to persist in a more realistic solar system since all planets revolve in the same sense about the sun as jupiter .",
    "second , we expect the df of resonance - sticking , jupiter - crossing wimps of the types found in the toy solar system to be reduced , although it is not clear by how much .",
    "the df of such wimps is expected to be smaller because encounters with other planets ( especially the outer planets ) can perturb the wimps off the quasi - regular orbits they have when stuck to resonances .",
    "although simulations of kbos have shown that up to 1% of orbits can survive @xmath102 gyr with a lifetime distribution @xmath103 in a solar system consisting of only the four outer planets , we do not expect those results to generalize to wimps . even in the toy solar system ,",
    "only @xmath104 of wimps contributing to the df were on resonance - sticking orbits lasting @xmath105 myr .",
    "in addition , the typical wimp perihelia are much smaller than the kbo perihelia , so that wimps may experience close encounters with gas giants other than neptune ( the planet which governs much of the kbo dynamics ) .",
    "finally , we expect the overall gravitationally bound wimp number density to be within a factor of a few of what we found in the toy solar system , although this depends on whether a significant long lifetime tail ( a result of various resonances involving wimps interior to jupiter s orbit ) exists .",
    "the implications for direct detection experiments and neutrino telescopes will depend on how those wimps are distributed in velocity space . here",
    ", we consider a few possible ways in which a more complicated solar system might affect wimp orbits and the size of the wimp population .",
    "first , we consider the capture of wimps to the solar system . the gravitational cross section @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the mass of planet @xmath108 .",
    "the inner planets are not nearly massive enough to significantly boost the capture rate . in the outer solar system",
    ", jupiter is the most massive planet by a factor of @xmath109 , implying that its gravitational cross section is at least a factor of @xmath110 higher than any other planet . even if an outer planet were primarily responsible for capturing a wimp to the solar system , there are two reasons why the wimp df at the earth will be largely unaffected . first , if an outer planet captures a wimp on a jupiter - crossing orbit , jupiter will dominate the dynamics of the wimp .",
    "second , jupiter is the innermost outer planet .",
    "thus , the typical angular momentum of a wimp captured by another planet will be higher than a wimp captured by jupiter .",
    "we determined in section [ sec : df ] that the diffusion of angular momentum is typically much slower than energy diffusion .",
    "even if a wimp with initially large angular momentum diffuses down to jupiter s orbit , jupiter will again dominate the dynamics of the wimp , and will tend to eject the wimp before it can diffuse further in angular momentum . therefore , even if an outer planet captures wimps to the solar system , it is unlikely to affect the df of wimps at the earth .",
    "next , we consider the combined effects of gravitational diffusion and rescattering in the sun . while gould argued that the wimp df should be almost identical to the free space df in the geocentric frame due to gravitational diffusion , find that the df is not much larger than the df we found in our simulations",
    "in order to incorporate the effects of scattering in the sun in the wimp diffusion equation , started 2000 wimp orbits on a grid in geocentric velocity space , integrating orbits up to 49 myr .",
    "for each wimp that hit in the sun within that time , the original point in velocity space was assigned a scattering frequency ( @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the lifetime of the wimp before scattering ) .",
    "the loss term in the diffusion equation is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the wimp orbit density .",
    "this means that wimps are lost from the solar system on the timescale for them to hit the sun .",
    "the treatment of scattering in encompassed the various ways by which wimps are driven into the sun .",
    "simulations of near - earth object ( neo ) and asteroid orbits suggest that secular resonances ( occuring when either the rate of change of the longitude of perihelion @xmath115 or the longitude of the ascending node @xmath116 are the same as for one of the planets ) , as well as mean - motion and kozai resonances , drive them into the sun on @xmath117 myr timescales @xcite .",
    "while these effects are incorporated into the diffusion equation of lundberg & edsj , we find that there are several ways in which a full orbit integration with a monte carlo treatment of scattering could improve on the work of lundberg & edsj , and reasons why the df found by is likely to be too small .",
    "first , as we found in paper i and in section [ sec : df ] of this work , wimps can survive many passages through the sun before being removed from earth - crossing orbits . therefore , the lifetimes of wimps could be substantially longer that assumed by lundberg & edsj . the exact amount by which the lifetimes would be extended depends on how many passages wimps make through the sun each time they are driven into the sun by the planets , and how deeply into the sun the wimps penetrate . in addition , wimp orbits may precess rapidly in the sun , which may affect the type of orbit they are on .",
    "this may change the frequency with which wimps are driven into the sun in the future .",
    "one effect that may decrease the df is related to the short length of the earth - crossing orbit simulations . for a large swath in the geocentric velocity space , wimps",
    "were neither ejected from the solar system nor driven into the sun on timescales less than @xmath118 myr .",
    "however , wimps may be driven into the sun on longer timescales .",
    "in particular , wimps on highly eccentric or highly inclined orbits can survive a long time before being scattered onto orbits that lead either to ejection or penetration of the sun .",
    "this is because the orbits are almost perpendicular to the direction of motion of the planets , leading to high speed encounters with the planets in which the wimps are not strongly deflected .",
    "therefore , may be underestimating scattering in the sun by not simulating such orbits long enough .",
    "however , the size of the effect will be determined by the optical depth in the sun to wimps , and what the typical integrated optical depth is each time a high eccentricity or high inclination wimp is driven into the sun .",
    "if the integrated optical depth is small , then may not be underestimating the effects of scattering for this population . underestimating the lifetime of the wimps that encountered the sun within @xmath118 myr will be a bigger effect than underestimating the scattering probability of the wimps that neither are ejected nor pushed into the sun on 49 myr timescales since the latter is closer to the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "finally , the distribution of times at which wimps enter the sun for the first time is poorly sampled in , and the system is chaotic , so interpolating the lifetimes among grid points in velocity space may not be the best way to interpolate lifetimes . in paper",
    "i , we found that the df of solar captured wimps at the earth was dominated by the long lifetime tail in the earth - crossing wimp distribution .",
    "in fully integrating the wimp orbits , the impact of the long lifetime , gravitationally captured wimps on the df at the earth can be understood .    in summary",
    ", we suspect that the df predicted by is too conservative ; for most of wimp parameter space consistent with experimental limits on the wimp - baryon cross section , the optical depth per passage through the sun is small .",
    "thus , wimps can survive many passages through the sun before being removed from earth - crossing orbits .",
    "the effect of the longer lifetimes to scattering on the df will also depend on the ejection timescale .",
    "if the ejection timescale is shorter than the scattering timescale , the wimp df should resemble gould s prediction of the df if diffusion is the dominant gravitational process in the solar system , which would yield a bound wimp number density not significantly larger than predicted in this work ( although the fact that many of these wimps have low speeds has disproportionate consequences at neutrino telescopes ) .    however , diffusion is not necessarily the dominant gravitational process , at least in terms of the size of the df .",
    "neither gould nor s treatment of the gravitational processes in the solar system incorporate resonances ( s treatment of resonances extends only to the timescale for wimps to enter the sun ; the treatment of wimp - planet encounters is purely local ) .",
    "while @xcite find for their sample of neos , resonances do not change the semi - major axis distribution relative to diffusion for @xmath119 au , they can affect the other orbital parameters . since the df is sensitive to how wimps encounter the earth , it is important to understand the differences between purely diffusive orbital evolution and the evolution when resonances are present .",
    "moreover , if the resonances can shield wimps from close encounters with planets ( for example , the kozai resonance assures that either the eccentricity or inclination of an orbit is high , making encounters with planets only occur at high speeds ) , they can extend the lifetimes of certain classes of orbits .",
    "it is important to determine if resonances yield a significant long lifetime tail in the earth - crossing wimp distribution .    in conclusion , in a more realistic solar system , we expect that prograde wimps will have a higher density at the earth than retrograde wimps , and that the density of resonance - sticking jupiter - crossing wimps will be reduced .",
    "we suspect that the df of gravitationally bound wimps lies somewhere between the predictions of gould and in the absence of resonances , depending on the details of scattering in the sun , unless galactic gravitational fields affect the wimp df as strongly as suggested by our crude treatment in section [ sec : df ] .",
    "since resonances are important in the orbital evolution of neos and in the population of solar captured wimps described in paper i , we suspect that they will also be important for gravitationally captured wimps whose orbits become interior to jupiter s .",
    "however , orbits will need to be integrated in the full solar system in order to evaulate the effects of these resonances on the distribution function .",
    "we would like to test these hypotheses with simulations of wimps in a more realistic solar system .",
    "however , our experiences with simulating orbits in a toy solar system have highlighted some potential difficulties in going to a more complicated solar system .",
    "as is the case for simulating the solar - captured wimp population , the subject of paper i , the primary problem will be to simulate a statistically significant number of orbits in finite computing time . in the toy solar system",
    ", we required @xmath120 cpu - hours for the integration of @xmath121 wimp orbits , of which only @xmath122 became bound , and only @xmath123 of which contributed to the df at the earth .",
    "there were only 5 resonance - sticking wimps with lifetimes longer than 10 myr .",
    "since orbits in the real solar system display a much richer phenomenology than in the toy solar system , the number of wimps simulated in the toy solar system is insufficient to sample the spectrum of behavior in a more realistic solar system ; in fact , we barely simulated enough wimps to find the resonance - sticking phenomenon in the toy solar system simulations .",
    "just as we did in paper i ( section viib ) , we propose a few techniques for exploring solar system phenomenology in finite computing time .",
    "first , as in paper i , we recommend a series of intermediate simulations leading up to a full solar system simulation .",
    "perhaps the zero - order simulation in this series would include a more realistic treatment of galactic gravitational fields in another toy solar system simulation , and a sufficiently large number of particles to determine the resonance - sticking wimp df .",
    "the next simulation , in order to explore phenomena associated in systems with multiple planets , would include just three planets : jupiter , earth , and venus .",
    "the planets would initially be put on circular , coplanar orbits about the sun to highlight diffusion phenomena as well as mean - motion and kozai resonances . since the gravitational cross section scales as the square of the planet mass",
    ", we propose scaling up the masses of the earth and venus .",
    "the masses of the planets could be reduced in follow - up simulations .",
    "a possible next step would be to put the limited set of planets on more realistic orbits in order to explore changes to diffusion as well as the effects of secular resonances .",
    "second , we propose using more clever choices for the initial conditions of the simulations . while we weighted the initial conditions towards low energy wimps and restricted the range of angular momenta , still only a small fraction of wimps were captured in the solar system in order to boost the yield of bound wimps .",
    "we sampled wimps up to energies of @xmath124 .",
    "since the angular momenta were quite high in the high perihelion run , the only wimps captured in the solar system had energies several orders of magnitude below this upper limit . in the future , we recommend restricting high perihelion - like simulations to lower energies . in general , though , since wimp orbits in the solar system are chaotic and the gravitational cross sections are small , it is difficult to further improve the yield of bound , earth - crossing orbits by the choice of the weighting and range of @xmath45 and @xmath52 for the incoming halo wimps .",
    "however , if it appears that the long lifetime tail of the df in the toy solar system and additional capture of wimps from the halo by the outer planets are unimportant , initial conditions for the simulations may be drawn from the toy solar system df .",
    "this is an attractive choice because the cross section for jupiter to capture a halo wimp is small ( requiring us to simulate @xmath121 halo wimps to obtain a sample of @xmath125 bound wimps ) ; by sampling the toy solar system df , a far higher fraction of the simulated wimps should contribute to the full solar system wimp df at the earth .",
    "the reason to think this might work is because the typical diffusion timescales for the other planets in the solar system are far longer than for jupiter .",
    "therefore , for a short period of time after the birth of the solar system , the toy solar system df would be an accurate representation of the full solar system df .",
    "this technique is used in @xcite to speed up their orbital diffusion calculations in a jupiter - venus - earth solar system .",
    "however , there are two potential drawbacks to this approach . first , if the long lifetime tail in the toy solar system is important , the characteristic timescales of processes in the solar system related to planets other than jupiter may approach the characteristic timescale in the df , meaning that the long lifetime tail could be significantly altered by the other planets . second , if secular resonances act on short timescales to pump wimps into the sun , as suggested in simulations of neo orbits @xcite , the toy solar system df will not be an accurate representation of the full solar system df even on very short timescales .",
    "careful tests need to be performed to evaluate the possibility of this approach to the initial conditions .    in summary ,",
    "we emphasize the need for a series of simulations , culminating in a full solar system simulation , in order to understand the importance of different phenomena in the solar system .",
    "the choice of initial conditions is important to maximize statistics , but we are limited by the chaotic nature of the system .",
    "gravitational capture is most effective for halo wimps with speeds @xmath126 outside the potential well of the sun .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the uncertainty on the halo df at such small heliocentric speeds .",
    "we briefly detail three ways in which deviations from our fiducial halo wimp model may affect the gravitational capture rate @xmath127 of wimps in the halo , and hence , the bound wimp df . since we discussed anisotropic halo speed distributions in section [ sec : df ] , we omit further reference to anisotropy here .    \\1 .",
    "_ uncertainty in @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 : _ the halo model ( eq . [ eq : local_maxwell ] ) used to set up the initial conditions ( section [ sec : start ] ) and to derive the wimp df from simulation outputs ( appendix [ sec : df_estimator ] ) is a single - variate gaussian , non - rotating in a galactocentric frame , and assumes that the speed of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) @xmath131 and the one - dimensional halo wimp velocity dispersion is @xmath83 .",
    "the uncertainty in the speed of the lsr is @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "while the fiducial value of @xmath128 is what was used in our fiducial halo model , recent astrometry of masers in star - forming regions in the spiral arms of the milky way suggests @xmath133 @xcite . to determine what this uncertainty in @xmath128 implies for the uncertainty in the capture rate of wimps to the solar system , we find that the angle - averaged halo df outside the sphere of influence of the sun ( average over eq . [ eq : local_maxwell_sun ] ) @xmath134 for the heliocentric speed @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath129 is fixed , a 10% uncertainty in @xmath128 implies a @xmath136 uncertainty in the low speed halo wimp df , and hence , a 20% uncertainty in the capture rate of wimps from the halo .",
    "we note that we have neglected solar motion in our fiducial model , which is also of order 10% of the speed of the local standard of rest @xcite .    however , we set @xmath137 in the halo df . therefore , if we include the uncertainty of @xmath129 through the uncertainty in @xmath128 , we find that a 10% uncertainty in @xmath128 yields a 30% uncertainty in the df .    there is further uncertainty in @xmath129 .",
    "we used @xmath137 since this is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion for an isothermal halo df for a power - law density distribution @xmath138 .",
    "since halos are approximately described by an nfw profile , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a scale radius , @xmath138 corresponds to the transition between the inner cusp ( @xmath141 ) and the outer halo ( @xmath142 ) @xcite .",
    "simulations suggest that the solar circle should be near this transition zone , although only small changes in the position of the sun with respect to the transition radius can yield different relationships between the circular speed and the velocity dispersions ( see fig .",
    "11 in @xcite ) . in general",
    ", a power - law density distribution @xmath143 yields a velocity dispersion @xmath144 for an isothermal df , so if the sun is well within the transition , @xmath145 , while @xmath146 if outside ( see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "if there is no uncertainty in @xmath128 and it is fixed to the fiducial value , the uncertainty in the relation between @xmath129 and @xmath128 yields an uncertainty in the low speed halo wimp df of order @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the total uncertainty in the gravitational capture rate of wimps to the solar system due to uncertainties in @xmath129 and @xmath128 is of order 50% assuming that the wimps have an isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "simulations show that a multi - variate gaussian is a good fit the macroscopic velocity distribution near the solar system at the speeds relevant for capture in the solar system , while we have used a single - variate gaussian @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion in each direction is within @xmath148 of the one - dimensional velocity dispersion used in our simulations .",
    "therefore , we believe that the uncertainty in @xmath149 yields greater uncertainty in the capture rate than treating the halo as a single - variate instead of a multi - variate gaussian .    finally , we consider uncertainties in the local wimp density @xmath130 .",
    "dark matter - only n - body simulations show that the density at any radius from the galactic center should be within @xmath148 of its mean value in the shell .",
    "however , the observed uncertainty in the local dark matter density is much higher because baryons dominate the local potential and density , and the distribution of baryons in the galaxy is somewhat uncertain @xcite .",
    "there is approximately a factor of two uncertainty in the local dark matter density owing to the uncertainty in the baryon distribution @xcite .",
    "this yields a factor of @xmath150 uncertainty in the annihilation rate of wimps in the earth .",
    "_ halo substructure : _ finally , we consider the issue of dark matter substructure .",
    "substructure will have a small effect on the df of gravitationally captured wimps for the same reasons why it has a negligible effect on the df of solar captured wimps ( discussed in paper i ) .",
    "briefly , the probability that the solar system is in a dense subhalo is @xmath151 at any given time @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium time of the gravitationally captured wimp df is sufficiently large that the solar system should have passed through many clumps in the equilibrium time .",
    "the velocity distribution of subhalos is somewhat biased , at the level of the velocity dispersion of subhalos being @xmath152 higher than the smooth component @xcite .",
    "this yields order unity or less changes in the capture rate relative to the capture rate if the velocity distribution of subhalos were unbiased with respect to the smooth component .",
    "thus , the capture rate of wimps to the solar system averaged over the df equilibrium time @xmath153 , where @xmath127 is the capture rate of the smooth component in the absence of substructure .",
    "thus , we find that the presence of substructures in the halo and the uncertainty in @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 of the smooth halo wimp df only change the overall capture rate of wimps in the solar system by at most of order unity . this will yield a factor of a few uncertainty in the annihilation rate of wimps in the earth , although it is unlikely that the rate will be high enough to produce an observable signal in icecube .",
    "_ macroscopic dark matter structure : _ in hydrodynamic n - body simulations of the evolution of disk galaxies , a second dark matter structure has been found .",
    "this is a `` thick disk '' of dark matter , whose properties mimic the thick stellar disk , and is a result of satellite galaxies being preferentially dragged into the disk plane as they merge with disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the thick disk has of order the same density at the solar circle as the more spherical dark matter halo , but is oblate and rotates in the same sense as the sun about the galactic center .",
    "the dark matter in the thick disk typically has a smaller speed with respect to the sun and a smaller velocity dispersion than halo dark matter .",
    "both effects tend to boost the capture rate of wimps in the solar system .",
    "the implications of this structure on the bound wimp df and event rates in neutrino telescopes are described in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    * we found the df of wimps gravitationally bound to a toy model solar system consisting of jupiter on a circular orbit about the sun .",
    "* while the df matches the detailed balance prediction for geocentric speeds @xmath154 , the fit to that prediction is poor for larger speeds .",
    "this discrepancy is largely due to the difficulty in populating retrograde , earth - crossing orbits .",
    "we find a small population of long - lived earth - crossing resonance - sticking orbits , contributing @xmath99 to the number density of gravitationally bound wimps at the earth . *",
    "the df of gravitationally bound wimps is largely insensitive to the details of wimp - nucleus interactions in the sun , confirming the findings of @xcite . *",
    "if external galactic gravitational fields become important for distances @xmath155 au from the sun , the df could be significantly smaller than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound_comparison ] , by up to a factor of three . future simulations of wimps in the solar system should include more realistic treatments of external gravitational fields . *",
    "the df of gravitationally captured wimps is of order the same size as the largest df of solar captured wimps consistent with limits on the wimp - nucleon cross section ( paper i ) .",
    "since the df of gravitationally captured wimps is larger at lower speeds , it dominates the annihilation rate of wimps in the earth for @xmath156 gev .",
    "since the df of solar captured wimps is larger at higher geocentric speeds , solar captured wimps dominate the direct detection signal of bound wimps . *",

    "* we find that the annihilation rate in the earth of wimps gravitationally captured to the solar system agrees with @xcite s prediction for a toy solar system .",
