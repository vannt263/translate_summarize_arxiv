    "in the previous paper@xcite , the present authors studied the proposal@xcite that a @xmath4 dimensional induced metric can be constructed from a @xmath2 dimensional field theory using gradient flow@xcite , applying the method to the o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1 model .",

    "this property establishes that the flow equation can be interpreted as a renormalization group transformation .",
    "in particular at @xmath5 , we show that the running coupling so defined has not only the asymptotic free uv fixed point but also a wilson - fisher ir fixed point for the massless case .    as the second application , we investigate the nlo correction to the induced metric in @xmath10 dimensions from the massless scalar model in 3 dimensions . in the massless limit",

    "a remarkable thing is that , while the nlo corrections do not change the ads radius in the uv limit , the ads radius is reduced by the nlo correction in the ir limit , which corresponds to the wilson - fisher ir fixed point of the original theory . in other words , a nontrivial fixed point in the field theory",

    "<S> , we derive 2-pt and 4-pt functions of flowed fields . as the first application of the nlo calculations , we study the running coupling defined from the connected 4-pt function of flowed fields in the @xmath4 dimensional theory . we show in particular that this running coupling has not only the uv fixed point but also an ir fixed point ( wilson - fisher fixed point ) in the 3 dimensional massless scalar theory . as the second application </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the nlo correction to the induced metric in @xmath4 dimensions with @xmath5 in the massless limit . </S>",
    "<S> while the induced metric describes a 4-dimensional euclidean anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space at the leading order as shown in the previous paper , the nlo corrections make the space asymptotically ads only in uv and ir limits . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , while the ads radius does not receive a nlo correction in the uv limit , the ads radius decreases at the nlo in the ir limit , which corresponds to the wilson - fisher fixed point in the original scalar model in 3 dimensions . </S>"
