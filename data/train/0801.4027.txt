    "@xcite infer a dark halo mass of @xmath6 and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath7 for leo t. from hi observations , @xcite infer a lower limit for the total dynamical mass of @xmath8 and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "they also detect two distinct components in the neutral hydrogen , one cold ( @xmath10500 k ) and one warm ( @xmath106000 k ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that such a low luminosity system still contains gas and very young stars at the current epoch .    in this work we present deep photometry of leo t , obtained with the large binocular telescope .",
    "we use these data , the deepest data available on leo t , to study its stellar populations and structural properties .",

    "recently commissioned , the lbt consists of two 8.4 meter mirrors on a single mount @xcite and is located on mount graham in arizona , usa . the lbc is a wide - field imager consisting of four 2048@xmath114608 pixel chips , providing a field - of - view of 23@xmath1123   with a pixel size of 023 .",
    "the data , obtained as part of the lbt science demonstration time program , were taken on 2007 march 21 under seeing conditions of 10@xmath1211 . in each filter , four exposures of five minutes each were taken with small offsets to help with bad pixel and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "one @xmath1 band frame was not used for the current work because of poor guiding .",
    "data reduction was performed using the reduction pipe - line developed by @xcite , based on standard routines in the iraf package _ mscred_. the images were trimmed , bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using the combined twilight flats . because of the ` fast ' focal ratio ( @xmath13/1.14 ) of the lbt primary mirrors there is significant field distortion ( 1.75% ) near the edges of the field - of - view .",
    "this distortion was removed with a quadratic radial correction to an accuracy of @xmath1002 .",

    "detection of stars and photometry was performed using the psf - fitting photometry package daophot . because the observations were done in filters that are very close to the sdss @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , the photometry was calibrated to sdss without the need for using standard star observations or atmospheric extinction corrections .",
    "the accuracy of the zeropoint calibration was @xmath140.03 mag and @xmath150.02 mag .",
    "based on the dust extinction maps from @xcite the photometry was corrected star - by - star for foreground extinction ; the extinction in the leo t field varies between e(b - v)@xmath160.027 and 0.041 mag , with a mean of e(b - v)@xmath160.035 mag . for clarity",
    ", we will refer to the extinction - corrected magnitudes as @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the photometric uncertainties and completeness were determined with artificial star tests .",
    "1600 artificial stars were placed at 0.25 magnitude intervals between 16th and 29th magnitude in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images and subsequently detected and photometered using daophot .",

    "* ) of our photometry in the central region of leo t. in  [ sec : sfh ] we will redetermine the distance to leo t , but for the moment we assume the distance modulus of 23.1 mag from the discovery paper ( based on hb luminosity and cmd - fitting ) and overlay three isochrones from @xcite for ages of 5 , 8 , and 12.5 gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath211.7 dex in panel ( a ) .",
    "it is clear that all three isochrones fit the rgb and rc very well and that photometry down to the turn - off ( @xmath2227 for 12.5 gyr ) will be necessary to constrain the age of this older stellar population . in panel",
    "( b ) three 8 gyr isochrones of [ fe / h]@xmath212.3 , @xmath121.7 , and @xmath121.3 dex are overlayed on the hess diagram , indicating that both the average color of the rc and the slope of the rgb favor a metallicity of @xmath121.7 dex .",
    "isochrones for much younger ages of 250 , 400 , and 650 myr and [ fe / h]=-1.7 dex are overplotted on the hess diagram in panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : hess ] .",
    "this clearly implies that the stars bluewards of ( @xmath0-@xmath1)@xmath19=0.0 are young ms stars , and that the bl feature and group of stars around ( 0.0,21.0 ) are indeed helium - burning bl stars belonging to the same population .",
    "the 250 myr isochrone seems to set a lower limit on the age , as its turn - off and bl seem too bright for the data .",
    "the 650 myr isochrone shows that young stars also contribute to the rc , increasing the uncertainty in distance and age measurements using the rc luminosity , as these are age and metallicity dependent @xcite . that the metallicity of the young stars is very difficult to determine",
    "is illustrated in panel ( d ) , where 400 myr isochrones with [ fe / h ] of @xmath122.3 , @xmath121.7 , and @xmath121.3 are overplotted .",
    "the regions of the cmd that are sensitive to the metallicity differences are too sparsely populated to make this measurement .",
    "while the luminosity and color of the rc can be used to constrain population parameters such as distance , age and metallicity , there are degeneracies and solutions are generally not unique @xcite .",
    "the presence of a rc , rather than a more extended hb , in itself implies that the stars are not both old and metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath232 ) .",
    "however , since the metallicity of the older stars is relatively well - constrained by the rgb slope , we can use the rc luminosity to determine either the distance or the age of the older stars , using the theoretical rc absolute @xmath24-band luminosities from @xcite . from our data we determine the location of the rc by iteratively finding the mean color and magnitude of stars in a 0.25@xmath110.5 mag box centered on the rc . using different starting color and magnitude values around the approximate center",
    "we find @xmath25=23.71@xmath40.03 and @xmath26=0.43@xmath40.02 , where the errors are determined from bootstrap resampling tests .",
    "using the photometric equations determined by lupton ( 2005 ) this translates to @xmath27=22.76@xmath40.04 mag .",
    "the interplay between age and distance for the brightness of the rc , at a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath28 , is illustrated in figure [ fig : redclump ] , where we plot the absolute magnitude of rc stars as a function of age @xcite . assuming a distance modulus of 23.1",
    ", the rc luminosity implies an average age of the older stars in leo t of @xmath107 gyr .",
    "alternatively , considering that the age of the stars might vary from 5 to 13 gyr , as indicated by the left - most panel of figure [ fig : hess ] , this implies that the distance modulus lies between 22.9 and 23.2 magnitudes .",
    "the stellar sources within 1.4   from the center of leo t are divided in two subsets corresponding to the young ( @xmath21 gyr ) and the old ( @xmath35 gyr ) stellar populations described in  [ sec : pops ] .",
    "this is done using the cmd selection boxes outlined in panel ( e ) of figure [ fig : hess ] ; by combining these two subsets we create a third subset of both old and young leo t candidate members . in this section",
    "we study the structural properties of these three subsets , which we will refer to as ` all ' , ` young ' , and ` old ' stars , and which contain 2247 , 854 , and 1393 stars , respectively .",
    "the central coordinates of leo t were determined for the three subsets by iteratively calculating the mean center of the distribution of stars on the sky within an aperture of 6   centered on the assumed center , until the offset between subsequent iterations was zero . in table [ tab : structprop ] the ra and dec for each set of stars is listed .",
    "errors in the obtained centers were determined using bootstrap resampling .",
    "there is a small offset of 03 , or 35 pc , between the centers of the distribution of young and old stars , which is significant at the 2@xmath29 level .",
    "figure [ fig : densities ] displays the surface density of stars as contour diagrams ; panels ( a ) through ( c ) are for all stars , the old stars , and the young stars , respectively , and panel ( d ) shows the contours of both the old and young stars .",
    "the center of the distribution of all stars is indicated with a cross in panels ( a ) through ( c ) , to help identify the apparent offset between the different subsets of stars .",
    "the contours correspond to densities of 1.5 , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 25 @xmath29 above the background , where @xmath29 is the poisson uncertainty in the background stellar density .",
    "leo t appears to be very compact and round and there is little sign of any distortion or extra - tidal features .",
    "fitting of a series of elliptical contours using the iraf routine _ ellipse _ shows that for all subsets of stars the ellipticity is below 0.1 out to a radius of 3   from the center , where the density of stars drops below 1.5@xmath29 above the background .    to measure the half - light radii , core radii , and limiting radii of leo t and its sub - populations , king profiles and exponential profiles were fit to the stellar distributions .",
    "for each subset of stars , the profiles were fit to the stellar density in circular annuli of increasing radius and width , centered on the center found for that subset , as listed in table [ tab : structprop ] .",
    "crowding is not an issue for star counting down to the magnitude limit we use ( 25.5 mag , see figure [ fig : hess ] ) .",
    "the results for the exponential ( @xmath30 ) , half - light ( @xmath31 ) , core ( @xmath32 ) , and limiting ( @xmath33 ) radii are listed in table [ tab : structprop ] and the density profiles with the corresponding best king profile fits are presented in figure [ fig : kingfits ] .",
    "the uncertainties on the fit parameters were determined using bootstrap resampling .",
    "contrary to the tentative conclusion by @xcite that the young stars seem less concentrated , comparing the density profiles from our deeper data shows unambiguously ( @xmath34 ) that the young stars are more centrally concentrated ; their central density is three times higher than that of the old stars , while the limiting radii are indistinguishable .",
    "this leads to a difference of a factor two in the concentration parameter @xmath35 between these populations .",

    "first , for each age bin the minimum and maximum star formation rates are found in the set of models that qualify as `` good fits '' .",
    "if all `` good fit '' models give the same star formation rate in a particular age bin , this error component for that particular bin would be zero .",

    "the scatter in the star formation rates and metallicities for each age bin is the second error component .",
    "these two error components are added quadratically to give the final error bars .",
    "starfish on the other hand , determines error bars by measuring the confidence intervals of each amplitude through a systematic exploration of parameter space in the vicinity of the best fit .",
    "first , each amplitude is varied in turn while holding all others at their best - fit values .",
    "this determines the independent uncertainty on each amplitude .",
    "next , amplitude pairs that are similar in age or metallicity are varied together while holding all other amplitudes at their best - fit values .",
    "this determines the covariant uncertainties between amplitude pairs that may be partially degenerate .",
    "finally , parameter space is explored uniformly by deviating from the best - fit location along a series of random `` directions '' in parameter space .",
    "we step along each direction , until the fitting statistic increases to our `` good fit '' limit .",
    "the random - direction search is performed many thousands of times .",
    "the final error bars are the maximum and minimum value of each amplitude for all tested parameter space locations whose fitting statistic fell under the `` good fit '' threshold .",
    "this difference in approach leads to very different error bars at the young end , where the starfish error bars ( figure [ fig : starfish ] ) are very large because the upper main - sequence is very poorly populated , and thus poorly constrained . on the other hand , this lack of evidence for very young ( @xmath2100 myr ) stars causes the match error bars in these bins to be very small ( figure [ fig : matchsfhamr ] ) .",
    "however , based on these data some low - level on - going star formation can not be strictly excluded .",
    "since the data do not reach the ancient main - sequence turn - off at the distance of leo  t , the sfh solutions for ages older than a few gyr are based entirely on the morphology of the red giant branch and horizontal branches . in particular , at metallicities around [ fe / h]=@xmath121.5 , truly ancient core helium - burning stars are predicted to extend slightly blueward of the canonical `` red clump '' feature ( see the 12.5  gyr isochrone plotted in figure  [ fig : hess]a ) .",
    "the subtlety of this feature in the cmd contributes to the uncertainty of the derived star formation rate in the oldest age bin .",
    "based on deep @xmath17 and @xmath18 photometry obtained with the lbt , we have studied the stellar populations and structural properties of the leo t dwarf galaxy .",
    "a comparison of the background - subtracted hess diagram with theoretical isochrones confirms the presence of very young stars with ages between @xmath10200 myr and 1 gyr , and an older stellar population ( @xmath58 gyr ) , the latter with with a likely metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath591.7 .",
    "the stellar mass in the young population is estimated to be @xmath1010% of the total stellar mass .",
    "based on the apparent magnitude of the rc stars we determine the distance modulus of leo t to be 23.1@xmath40.2 , confirming the value from @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity of leo t is estimated to be @xmath608.0 mag , almost one magnitude higher than the estimate from the discovery paper . using the mass estimate for leo t from @xcite",
    "this implies a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath61 .    a more sophisticated analysis of the photometry using cmd - fitting techniques yields similar results .",
    "the distance determination gives a distance modulus of @xmath6223.0@xmath40.2 .",
    "cmd fits with two different software packages both indicate two distinct episodes of star formation , one at @xmath106  12 gyr and one at @xmath100.4  1 gyr , although the drop in star formation rate in between has a low significance . from the cmd",
    "fits no strong metallicity evolution is apparent , with an approximate metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath51.5 at all times .",
    "the metallicity seems to have a small dip around @xmath63 , but since the metallicity constraints at that age come from regions of the cmd where the stellar models are least reliable , such as the rc and asymptotic giant branch , this is not significant .    old and young stars were preferentially selected using cmd - selection boxes in order to study their individual spatial distributions .",
    "the young stars are more strongly concentrated near the center of leo t , but both components display the same spatial extent .",
    "there seems to be a slight offset between the young and old stars , but from these data this is hardly significant . since stars are formed in clusters , young stars are usually spatially more strongly confined than older stars .",

    "the presence of both old or intermediate ( @xmath35 gyr ) age stars and very young ( @xmath21 gyr ) stars is common , as is the metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath641.5 .",

    "our luminosity estimate of @xmath658.0 is two magnitudes fainter than any of the other transition objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore leo t remains the least luminous galaxy with recent star formation known .",
    "we find no evidence for tidal distortion of leo t. this is not unexpected , since it is at a large distance from the milky way and m31 , although based on the limited information about its orbit it can not be excluded that leo t has come close to the milky way some time in the past .",
    "however , the lack of distortion implies that its low mass and luminosity are intrinsic , rather than the result of interaction or disruption .",
    "thus , the case of leo t suggests that isolated halos with masses as low as @xmath66 are able to accrete and/or retain gas and form stars for at least a hubble time .",
