    "up to 10% of nearby galaxies have energetic , non - stellar seyfert activity in their nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "currently it is unknown why this fraction is 10% , and not 100% .",
    "one of the most appealing explanations for this puzzle is the duty cycle hypothesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it can be speculated that _ all _ spiral galaxies ( seyfert activity appears almost exclusively in spiral galaxies ) become active for a limited period of time in their lives . since a typical age for a nearby spiral galaxy is 10@xmath2  years , and 10% of nearby spirals have seyfert nuclei , the activity may last up to 10@xmath3  years .",
    "the central problem in feeding agn activity is the supply of adequate fuel . while tidal disruption of stars in the vicinity of supermassive nuclear black holes is unlikely to be efficient enough to supply several m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , as is required for feeding quasar activity , the mass consumption rates in seyferts are only on the order of 0.1  m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". tidal disruption of stars may be a sufficient mechanism for maintaining liner activity @xcite , but the only viable mechanism for feeding seyfert activity appears to be the conversion of gas mass into radiation in accretion disks @xcite that have been speculated to surround supermassive nuclear black holes .",
    "in addition to the possibility of nuclear bars , or `` bars within bars '' , magnetic braking in a circumnuclear ring can drive gas inflow towards a nucleus and its accretion disk @xcite .",
    "interstellar gas in the central region of a galaxy can come from at least two sources .",
    "first of these is mass loss from evolved stars .",
    "this mechanism may produce a few 0.1 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 within the central few kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another source of gas is from secular inflow , especially in a barred potential .",
    "gravitational torques from bars are known to be capable of extracting angular momentum from the gas that piles up along the leading edge of the bar , and cause a secular inflow of gas towards the central region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if a dynamical resonance ( the so - called inner lindblad resonance , hereafter ilr ; e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) exists , gas will tend to pile up in a ring around the ilr radius ( there can be 0 , 1 , or 2 ilrs , or in the case of a large central mass concentration , even a third ilr ; gas tends to pile up and form a ring between the two outer ilrs , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "properties of such rings have been discussed in numerous papers .",
    "a good and comprehensive summary is given by @xcite .",
    "the nuclear rings are often locations of vigorous star formation ( sf ) .",
    "while the exact fraction of gas that is consumed by sf in these rings is not known yet ( although it is likely to vary from galaxy to galaxy ) , it is clear that the circumnuclear rings play a crucial role in regulating the gas supply to the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to determine whether some properties of the circumnuclear rings , such as a special location of star forming regions , star forming rates , closeness to the nucleus , etc . , are related to the activity class of the nucleus .",
    "conversely , nuclear activity can have an impact on the properties of the starburst ring , e.g. , in the form of star - forming activity in the circumnuclear ring triggered by a radio jet , as demonstrated on large - scale in minkowski s object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". these issues can be studied by looking for similarities and/or differences in the ring properties and the strength of nuclear activity between seyfert and starburst galaxies .",
    "earlier studies of circumnuclear rings have largely concentrated on the use of ultraviolet , optical , or near - infrared ( nir ) images and spectra to study the properties of sf in these regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "direct observations of the molecular gas also exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mostly via co that can be used as a tracer of the more abundant molecular hydrogen with certain caveats , such as the uncertainty in the conversion of the co luminosities into total molecular gas masses , but the spatial resolution in most co studies has been insufficient to resolve the rings adequately .",
    "an alternative and potentially more powerful way to study the properties of the circumnuclear rings is provided by high resolution radio continuum observations .",
    "radio wavelengths are free of extinction effects that dust has in optical and , for high extinction , even in near - infrared images .",
    "the radio emission coming from the rings is believed to consist of two main components .",
    "first , thermal emission , tracing bremsstrahlung from free electrons in regions , thermalized by the optically thick medium .",
    "second , nonthermal emission , coming from electrons spiraling in magnetic fields , either surrounding recent supernova remnants ( seen in high resolution maps ) , or in the general magnetic field of the underlying disk galaxy ( seen in low resolution , high sensitivity maps , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) , or in the enhanced magnetic field of the ring @xcite .",
    "emission from agn is also nonthermal .",
    "nonthermal emission usually dominates the emission maps seen at 6 and 20 cm , whereas at shorter wavelengths the thermal fraction can be substantial or even dominate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting feature of radio continuum maps of several active galaxies is the strong point source in the nucleus , and jets or highly collimated outflows emanating from the nucleus . in seyfert galaxies , these jets",
    "are usually seen at a few hundred pc scale @xcite , but they can extend to kpc scales ( e.g. , ngc  4258 : @xcite @xcite ; ngc  7479 : @xcite @xcite ) . the orientation of the jets with respect to the rotation axis or disk plane of the galaxy has been observed to be fairly random @xcite .",
    "such a collimated outflow has the potential of triggering sf in a circumnuclear region as hinted by , e.g. , @xcite and minkowski s object @xcite .",
    "the recent study by @xcite suggests that galaxies with an active nucleus may have rings more often than galaxies without such a nucleus .",
    "one of the main objectives of the current paper is to investigate if evidence for jets and triggering of sf exists among nearby seyfert galaxies , and to contrast their circumnuclear properties to those of nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "the triggering of sf in starburst galaxies is most likely external to the circumnuclear region , as there is no strong nuclear outflow component .",
    "several previous investigations of the radio continuum morphology in the central regions of nearby disk galaxies have been performed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , none of these earlier investigations either had a balanced sample between seyfert and non - seyfert galaxies , or supporting near - infrared line images of 2.166 @xmath6 m br@xmath0 or 2.122 @xmath6 m h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) emission to study the star forming morphology and properties .",
    "many of the previously listed studies also had resolution and sensitivity combinations that were not ideally suited to detecting extended but resolved circumnuclear structure , for which a resolution of order 12 arcseconds is needed , together with a sensitivity to structures tens of arcseconds in extent .",
    "our new observations are ideal for the study of such structure . in addition",
    ", we have gathered data at several wavelengths , approximately matched in spatial resolution , to further improve the sensitivity to emission from different mechanisms at various spatial scales and to provide some information on the radio spectral indices at various locations in our targets .",
    "our sample consists of both seyfert and starburst galaxies , all of which are either barred or merging systems , thus making recent gas inflow likely .",
    "we include all the nearby ( within 100 mpc ) seyfert , starburst or merging / interacting galaxies which have nir line images of either 2.166 @xmath6 m br@xmath0 or 2.122 @xmath6 m h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) emission or both available , and which do not have existing sensitive radio continuum observations at 12 arcsec resolution at 3.5 , 6 or 20 cm .",
    "vla sensitivity in the l - band ( 20 cm ) improved by a factor of two in the early 1990s when the receivers were upgraded ( p.",
    "lilly and r. perley , private communication ) .",
    "the c - band receivers have also improved , resulting in a sensitivity improvement , although it is not as dramatic as in the l - band .",
    "therefore , in some cases we reobserved galaxies that had no vla radio continuum observations at a comparable resolution since late 1980s .",
    "general parameters of the ten galaxies that satisfied our sample selection criteria are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . of our sample galaxies ,",
    "five have seyfert classifications ( one seyfert 1 and four seyfert 2s ) and five have starburst nuclei , and at least two are in merging or interacting systems . a sample of this size is useful in a pilot study such as ours to look for any trends and differences between the various nuclear activity classes .",
    "we do not distinguish between the various activity subclasses such as seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies in the following , but only contrast the properties of seyfert galaxies against non - seyfert galaxies .",

    "the distance - independent radio powers at 20 cm are listed in table  [ tbl3 ] .",
    "one should note that these powers are measured within widely varying physical sizes in the galaxies ( from @xmath16400 pc in ic  342 to @xmath169.8 kpc in ngc  6240 , see table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "it appears that the seyfert galaxies are slightly more powerful than the starburst galaxies in radio wavelengths .",
    "the merging system ngc  6240 has the largest radio power .",
    "there also appears to be a slight tendency towards higher radio powers among the more strongly barred galaxies .",
    "this is in agreement with the result of @xcite who found that the average surface brightness in radio continuum correlates with the relative bar length .",
    "table  [ tbl3 ] also includes an attempt to estimate the fraction of the radio continuum emission coming from the nuclear unresolved component , after fitting a gaussian to it to estimate its flux density . in all cases ,",
    "the extended emission dominates .",
    "three out of five non - seyfert galaxies have no unresolved component , while the average fraction of flux contributed by the unresolved component is about 25% for the seyfert galaxies .",
    "finally , table  [ tab35 ] shows the cas ( concentration , c , asymmetry , a , and clumpiness , s ) measurements at 20 cm for all the sample galaxies .",
    "these measurements were made in a way similar to that in @xcite .",
    "concentration was measured in 3 and 10 arcsec radius apertures . in cases where the central structure is clearly elliptical ( ngc  520 , ngc  4536 , ngc  7771 )",
    "the measurements were made in elliptical annuli aligned along the major axis of the structure and having a major axis length of 3 and 10 arcsec .",
    "naturally , since the distances of the galaxies vary by a large factor , these apertures measure different physical scales , but we consider that it is more important to measure the concentration regardless of the physical scale , since in almost all galaxies most of the detected radio continuum emission lies in scales 1020 arcsec or less .",
    "the galaxies with the highest concentration indices are ngc  7771 , ngc  6240 , and ngc  7469 , as also seen in the radio continuum emission figures .",
    "the asymmetry was calculated by rotating the image by 180 degrees , then subtracting the rotated image from the original , taking the absolute value of the difference , and dividing the result by the original image .",
    "in addition , we only considered regions that had emission at higher than 4-sigma level in the original image ( which was thus used as a mask ) .",
    "if a galaxy was perfectly symmetric , then the asymmetry index would have a value of zero .",
    "high values indicate a large degree of asymmetry . in ngc  7469",
    "we used 8-sigma as the threshold for masking .",
    "the most asymmetric galaxy is ngc  6240 with its one - sided emission structure .",
    "clumpiness was calculated by subtracting an image smoothed to 5 arcsec resolution from the original image , then dividing the result by the original image .",
    "thus , clumpy galaxies will have large clumpiness index values .",
    "the uncertainties in the measured quantities are estimated to be @xmath17  0.15 for asymmetry , @xmath17  0.1 for clumpiness , and @xmath17  0.05 for concentration .",
    "the average asymmetry , clumpiness , and concentration are not statistically different between seyfert and non - seyfert galaxies ( table  [ tab35 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we do not find any differences in the circumnuclear cas properties in our sample of seyfert and starburst galaxies .",
    "we searched the literature for sf and supernova ( sn ) rates in the central regions of our sample galaxies .",
    "the results are displayed in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "the given numbers have been adjusted to our adopted distances as given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to find the sf and sn information for all the sample galaxies .",
    "the sn rate was estimated from br@xmath0 fluxes together with starburst models , or from radio continuum ( usually at 20 cm ) .",
    "since there exists a relationship between br@xmath0 and non - thermal radio continuum fluxes , the two methods are tied to each other .",
    "we expect type ii supernovae to be the main contributors to the cosmic rays emitting the observed radio continuum in the circumnuclear starburst regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the nonthermal radio continuum emission intensity strongly depends on the strength of the magnetic field which may also be enhanced in the starburst regions @xcite .",
    "the sf rates in our sample galaxies vary between quiescent sf ( a few tenths of m@xmath18  yr@xmath5 ) to several m@xmath18  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the sf rates between seyfert and starburst galaxies do not have any obvious differences .",
    "it is also well known that many seyfert 2 galaxies have associated circumnuclear starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "most of the sn rates are between 0.01 and 0.15  yr@xmath5 , and there is no obvious difference between seyferts and starbursts .",

    "no clear trend can be seen . while the star formation is coincident with the radio continuum emission in a few galaxies , there are sf features seen in only one image , but not the other .",
    "this again suggests that radio continuum , especially at 6 and 20 cm , is not a reliable tracer of the location of sf activity , but it traces the overall magnetic fields of the galaxy where electrons released in sn events spiral and produce synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are only important if the nonthermal fraction of the emission is significant .",
    "below we have estimated the contribution of the thermal emission for the galaxies which had 3.5-cm observations .",

    "the radio continuum emission is much more extended than the br@xmath0 emission , but the highest intensity , elongated radio continuum emission region coincides well with the br@xmath0 emission ( see fig .  [ n520fig ] ) . since the origin of br@xmath0 emission is sf , and the 20 cm radio continuum is most likely nonthermal emission from electrons generated by supernovae in starburst regions ,",
    "this spatial coincidence is expected .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission is slightly more extended than the br@xmath0 emission in ngc  520 .",
    "there is no sign of circumnuclear ring structures either in radio continuum or in optical images .",

    "our new data are more than a factor of two deeper than the @xcite data taken in the same vla configuration . the emission can be traced reliably within a 12 arcsec @xmath12 8 arcsec area in our image , whereas the @xcite map ( only 6 cm shown , no 20 cm data shown ) shows a structure of only 6 arcsec @xmath12 2.5 arcsec in extent .",

    "the registration of the radio continuum image with the h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) line image ( from * ? ? ?",

    "we matched the position of the most intense emission on the northwest side of the ring , and checked that the northeast emission feature matches spatially . assuming the registration that we used is correct , the ring - like structure in radio continuum matches well with a similar structure seen in molecular hydrogen emission , and also in other line images shown by @xcite .",

    "in fact , @xcite see even three radio components in vlba observations of the nuclear region , two of which are likely to be seyfert nuclei , based on their radio powers and brigthness temperatures , and one which could be a radio supernova .",
    "one of the seyfert nuclei also has jet - like extensions . according to @xcite the agn component has a bolometric luminosity of about 5  @xmath12  10@xmath23  erg  s@xmath5 , making ngc  6240 a very powerful seyfert galaxy .",
    "only one peak is seen in the h@xmath1 line observations of @xcite , who interpret the central peak to be located between the two nuclei as a result of a strong collision shock in the ism ( see fig .",

    "the sf activity in the nuclear region was recently studied by @xcite , who found extremely high sf and sn rates in the nucleus ( see table  [ table5 ] ) .",
    "@xcite studied the high resolution morphology using _ hst _ nicmos and wfpc2 observations .",
    "they see up to four nuclear components , and a superwind from a nuclear starburst roughly in the east  west direction .",
    "recent chandra observations of the nucleus of ngc  6240 have revealed two main emission peaks , implying the existence of two supermassive black holes , associated with the two merging nuclei @xcite .",
    "the high sf and sn rates presumably drive a powerful superwind .",
    "the radio continuum emission in the nuclear region is most likely a combination of synchrotron emission from electrons created by the high sn rate , and non - thermal emission from the active nuclei @xcite . scaling the 20 cm emission ( assuming it is all nonthermal and using a spectral dependence of s @xmath24 @xmath25@xmath26",
    ", 0.6 being a typical spectral index for the galaxies in our sample that had both 6 cm and 20 cm images ) to 3.5 cm and subtracting it we estimate that a considerable fraction of the emission at 3.5 cm can be thermal , up to 60% .",
    "however , the spectral index of the non - thermal emission down to 3.5 cm is not known for ngc 6240 .",
    "the most peculiar structure in this system is the extended western `` arm '' of radio continuum emission , which has several embedded peaks .",
    "this morphology has been interpreted as a result of synchrotron emission from a superwind , driven by the intense starburst in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays are generated in sf regions and propagate into the magnetic features .",
    "our observation of the radio continuum morphology ( the angle between the p.a . of the underlying galaxy and the radio continuum emission ) supports such a scenario .",
    "it is likely that the superwind seen in detail in the arcsec - resolution _ hst _ images of @xcite , is related to the peculiar radio continuum structure .",
    "we note that ngc  6240 is the most radio powerful galaxy in our sample , and has the highest sf and sn rates , together with nuclear activity .",
    "our new 3.5-cm data have a similar resolution to the 3.5-cm data discussed by @xcite .",
    "we show our new data set for comparison with the old data . @xcite",
    "published 6-cm data at a comparable resolution .",

    "ngc  6574 is a nearby seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "it is the only galaxy in our sample that displays a central point - like radio continuum component , a circumnuclear ring , and a connecting radio continuum feature between the two .",
    "note that the ring was not detected in the early vla high resolution radio continuum observations of @xcite , most likely because of inadequate sensitivity .",
    "our new data are a factor of five more sensitive than the old data published by @xcite .",
    "the `` jet '' is one - sided and is only at the 3@xmath27 level in the 20-cm map ( figure  [ n6574fig ] ) . at 3.5 cm ,",
    "where no previous high resolution data exist to our knowledge , there is a connection between the nucleus and the circumnuclear ring on the opposite side of the nucleus at 6@xmath27 level .",
    "this `` jet '' has a major - axis radius of about 10 arcsec ( just under 2 kpc ) .",
    "these `` jets '' lie close to the major axis of the galaxy , and therefore are unlikely to represent any outflows perpendicular to the galaxy disk .",
    "interestingly , there is moderate strength h@xmath1 emission near the end of the southern `` jet '' ( see fig .  [ n6574fig ] ) .",
    "an estimate of the thermal emission in the 3.5 cm image , constructed in a similar way to what was described above for ngc  6240 , also shows that there is likely to be a substantial thermal component to the 3.5 cm emission in the ring north of the nucleus .",
    "the br@xmath0 emission at this location is weak , so the northeastern radio continuum bridge is unlikely to be related to a `` jet '' striking the circumnuclear ring and triggering of sf there .",
    "the nucleus seems to have only nonthermal radiation at 3.5 cm , while elsewhere in the ring the thermal contribution could be up to 50% , based on estimating the nonthermal contribution from the 20 cm image by scaling it down to 3.5 cm with a spectral index of 0.6 .",
    "there appears to be a nuclear stellar ( and perhaps gaseous , seen by @xcite @xcite ) bar at a position angle of about 150 degrees , inside the ring .",
    "the strongest radio continuum emission occurs in the ring east of the nucleus , as does the strongest br@xmath0 and h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) emission ( see fig .",
    "[ n6574fig ] ) .",
    "there is a fairly good coincidence between the h@xmath1 10 s(1 ) and radio continuum emission , although there is a region of moderately strong radio continuum emission south  southeast of the nucleus in the ring that does not show up in the near - infrared line emission .",
    "however , the absence of any detected h@xmath1 emission there is likely to be due to the narrow bandwidth of the fabry ",
    "perot interferometer filter used in the observations of @xcite .",
    "an archival _ hst _ wfpc2 ultraviolet image at 3000    shows a patchy star - forming ring , but the detailed spatial correlation with the strongest radio and nir line emission is poor within the ring .",
    "there is a remarkable outflow structure clearly revealed by our radio continuum images of ngc  6764 , approximately perpendicular to the galaxy major axis , and therefore probably perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the only other earlier data at comparable resolution at 20 cm were published by @xcite , but those data have a sensitivity that is a factor of two worse than in our new data . the 6-cm and 21-cm westerbork maps by @xcite have a lower spatial resolution and sensitivity than our maps .",
    "our map shows clear cavities in the radio continuum emission , not shown by the @xcite map .",
    "our 3.5-cm map is the first high resolution map showing the radio continuum morphology at that wavelength . despite the outflow morphology , the sf and sn rates are not remarkably high , and",
    "therefore it is possible that continuous sf models give too low sf rates , and there actually was a starburst near the nucleus about 35 myr ago , as suggested by @xcite , who also discuss the molecular gas outflow in this galaxy .",
    "there appears to be little thermal emission in ngc  6764 at 3.5 cm , based on the scaling of the 20 cm emission with a spectral index of 0.6 .",

    "for example , the seyferts with the largest agn luminosities in our sample ( ngc  6240 and ngc  7469 ) exhibit different morphologies .",
    "ngc  6240 possesses small - scale jets and a nuclear outflow , which is likely connected to the peculiar western radio continuum loop .",
    "ngc  7469 has an aligned multicomponent radio continuum structure seen with vlbi observations , but its circumnuclear radio morphology seen in our 1.4 arcsec resolution observations does not present any specific structures , only a nuclear component with some diffuse emission around it .",
    "the agn with lower bolometric luminosities have a widely varying radio continuum structure as well .",
    "ngc  6574 has a circumnuclear radio continuum ring , ngc  6764 has an outflow structure in radio continuum , and finally ngc  7479 has peculiar large - scale radio `` jets . ''",
    "a nuclear starburst exhibits itself in various ways in the radio continuum morphology .",
    "ngc  6764 has a clear outflow morphology , while ngc  6240 has a peculiar loop structure on one side of the nucleus , possibly as a result of a superwind from several supernova explosions in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing structure is seen in ngc  7479 , which has a jet - like morphology , together with a core component , but no extended nuclear starburst region .",
    "this galaxy has been speculated to be experiencing a minor merger @xcite .",
    "it also has a massive molecular disk around the nucleus @xcite .",
    "future research is warranted into investigating any connection between a minor merger , the nuclear activity , and the radio `` jet . ''",
    "we have compared the radial surface brightness profiles of radio emission and br@xmath0 and/or h@xmath1 line emission . while the starburst rings show up clearly in the br@xmath0 emission , we see no systematic differences between the seyfert and starburst galaxies in these profiles",
    ". we also calculated the cas parameters for our sample galaxies .",
    "again , the average concentration , asymmetry , and clumpiness parameters are not significantly different between seyfert and starburst galaxies .",
    "the orientation of the radio continuum emission differs from the orientation of the galaxy major axis more in seyferts than in starbursts .",
    "we have also used sf and sn rates found in the literature to estimate how they depend on the distribution of radio continuum emission and the activity class of the galaxy .",
    "we have inspected the correlation of the sf and sn rates with the strength non - stellar nuclear activity or interaction class , but found no clear trends .    finally , we have compared the radio continuum morphology to that of nir line emission morphologies , including br@xmath0 and h@xmath1 line emission , when available .",
    "we find that the bulk of the radio continuum usually traces the sum of the br@xmath0 and h@xmath1 line emission fairly reliably .",
    "however , several extranuclear radio continuum emission features not visible in the nir line images were found , including the jet - like structures and the outflow - type structures .",
    "these differences are likely caused by the effects of dust absorption and scattering ( affecting near - ir emission ) and the spatial distribution and strength of magnetic fields ( affecting radio continuum emission ) .",
    "our results will be extended and validated in a follow - up study that includes a much larger sample of seyfert and starburst galaxies .",
    "the information content of the radio continuum observations will be increased by including polarization information .",
    "unfortunately , such observations are time - expensive , and the next step we intend to take includes a detailed study of the magnetic origin of the jet - like structure in ngc  7479 .",
    "we thank torsten bker , richard davies , and paul van der werf for providing us with near - infrared line images .",
    "we are also thankful to ray norris for comments on an earlier draft of this paper , to mark lacy for discussions on radio jet  agn luminosity correlation , and to tom pannuti for discussions on the radio continuum emission from supernova remnants .",
    "we are thankful to the referee , w. c. keel , for suggestions that improved the quality of the paper .",
