    "in reference  @xcite , we described a scheme for generating and detecting superposition states of a nanomechanical resonator .",
    "the scheme employs a qubit with dispersive coupling to the mechanical resonator . by preparing the qubit in a superposition of energy eigenstates and the mechanical resonator in a displaced thermal state ,",
    "the latter subsequently evolves into a superposition state , the existence of which can be inferred through appropriate qubit state control and measurement .    in the present paper , we describe a possible implementation of this scheme ( see figure [ schemefig ] ) that is based on the demonstrated circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) set - up  @xcite .",
    "control and readout of the qubit is achieved by pumping and probing the appropriate mode of a microwave coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) resonator that couples electromagnetically to the qubit .",
    "we shall consider two types of superconducting qubit : a capacitively coupled charge qubit , otherwise known as a cooper pair box ( cpb )  @xcite , and an inductively coupled flux qubit  @xcite . as we shall see , both types of qubit appear equally promising for implementation , having comparable strength couplings to the cpw resonator and to the nanomechanical resonator .",
    "one motivation for adopting the circuit qed set - up is the adequate demonstrated qubit coherence times for our purpose  @xcite .",
    "we suppose that a segment of the qubit flux loop directly opposite the centre conductor of the cpw is freely suspended , forming a doubly - clamped beam mechanical resonator .",
    "related schemes can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the usual ghz microwave qubit control / readout line that is capacitively coupled to the cpw , we require a separate , low frequency ( i.e. , tens of mhz and below ) centre conductor bias line , in order to achieve the necessary strong couplings between the mechanical resonator and both qubit and cpw mode , as well as to drive the mechanical resonator on resonance , producing the displaced thermal state . in the case of the capacitively",
    "coupled charge qubit , the required centre conductor voltage bias can be introduced via a series inductor , otherwise known as a ` bias tee ' that is microwave engineered to reflect the separate , much higher frequency ghz qubit control signal  @xcite . in the case of the inductively coupled flux qubit , the required current bias can be introduced via two superconducting low pass filters at each end of the centre conductor  @xcite .",
    "the high frequency thermal johnson noise entering the bias line can be significantly suppressed with additional low - pass filtering at each temperature stage of the set - up , while at the same time allowing sufficiently large dc voltage or current biases for the required mechanical resonator - qubit coupling strengths  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the high frequency thermal noise entering the microwave control line can be reduced by attenuating the signal  @xcite ; only low drive power signals are required to control the qubit  @xcite .",
    "sections 2 and 3 of this paper derive the respective charge and flux qubit hamiltonians with coupled , single microwave and mechanical modes .",
    "both qubit hamiltonians have a common origin in the cpw - coupled - dc squid circuit of figure  [ schemefig ] .",
    "section 2 discusses the classical dynamics , while section 3 derives the quantum hamiltonians of the charge and flux qubit systems , equations  ( [ concisechargehamiltonianeq ] ) and ( [ concisefluxhamiltonianeq ] ) respectively .",
    "while there is nothing particularly new in terms of theory in these two sections , they serve the purpose of mapping the scheme of reference  @xcite onto the circuit qed set - up with a unified treatment of the charge and flux qubit implementations , facilitating a direct comparison between them .",
    "readers not interested in the derivations may proceed directly to section 4 , where the relative merits of the qubit hamiltonians for actual device implementation are addressed .",
    "section 5 gives a brief conclusion .",
    "appendix a gives a derivation of the single mode approximation to the cpw superconducting phase wave equation , while appendix b derives the qubit langevin equations .",
    "in this section , we analyze the classical equations of motion for the phase field coordinate @xmath0 of a length @xmath1 coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) with longitudinal coordinate @xmath2 and gauge invariant phases @xmath3 and @xmath4 across each of the two josephson junctions ( jj ) of the dc squid .",
    "these equations are the common starting point for the subsequent derivations of both the microwave resonator mode - flux qubit and microwave resonator mode - charge qubit hamiltonians .",

    "we consider the centre conductor of the cpw to be uniformly @xmath247 m wide and separated from the lateral ground planes by a @xmath248 m gap . the doubly - clamped , suspended beam segment of the dc squid directly opposite the centre conductor is assumed to be @xmath249  nm wide , with a gap of @xmath250  nm between the two .",

    "interestingly , although the inductance ratio @xmath282 is about an order of magnitude smaller than the capacitance ratio @xmath283 , the flux quantum addition energy term is about an order of magnitude larger than the charging energy term , bringing the two coupling strength terms ( [ indcoupstrengtheq ] ) and ( [ capcoupstrengtheq ] ) into line .",

    "provided @xmath309 , the described interaction term can be approximately replaced with the dispersive interaction : @xmath310",
    "if the qubit is prepared and subsequently remains in its ground state during the driving interval , then we obtain the familiar ponderomotive interaction between the microwave and mechanical oscillator modes . for the above",
    "considered parameter values , we have for the dispersive coupling strength in either qubit case : @xmath311 interestingly , this upper bound on the achievable coupling strength is still orders of magnitude smaller than what is possible in a related scheme where the squid with mechanically compliant loop segment is instead imbedded within the planar waveguide , interrupting the centre stripline conductor  @xcite . applying the theoretical analysis of reference  @xcite assuming a dispersive coupling strength @xmath312 , microwave mode of @xmath313 and quality factor @xmath314 , and mechanical flexural mode of @xmath315 ( thus we are in the good cavity limit : @xmath316  @xcite ) and quality factor @xmath299 , we find that pump drive powers of magnitude @xmath317 are required in order to cool the flexural mode down to a few energy quanta starting from a temperature of , say , @xmath318 .",
    "such drive power strengths are unrealistic given the need to substantially attenuate the thermal johnson noise in the original ghz drive signal entering the rf line at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dispersive coupling in the presently considered scheme is not strong enough in order to achieve significant passive cooling .",
    "nevertheless , as emphasized in the companion paper  @xcite , there is no upper thermal threshold to verifying mechanical superposition states , although for the considered device parameters and temperatures higher than a few tens of mk , we expect it to become difficult to tease out the recoherences in an echo experiment that are the signature of mechanical superposition states .",
    "as long as the mechanical resonator temperature can be maintained to within a few tens of mk ( i.e. , dilution fridge temperatures ) during the drive and subsequent qubit control stages , there should be no problem observing mechanical superposition states ; cooling is not essential for the scheme .",
    "we have described an implementation of the nanomechanical quantum superposition generation and verification scheme presented in the companion reference  @xcite .",

    "<S> the implementation is based on the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) set - up , with the addition of a mechanical degree of freedom formed out of a suspended , doubly - clamped segment of the superconducting loop of a dc squid located directly opposite the centre conductor of a coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relative merits of two squid based qubit realizations are addressed , in particular a capacitively coupled charge qubit and inductively coupled flux qubit . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that both realizations are equally promising , with comparable qubit - mechanical resonator mode as well as qubit - microwave resonator mode coupling strengths . </S>"
