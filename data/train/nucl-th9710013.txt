    "experimental and theoretical studies of exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values present one of the most active areas of research in nuclear physics . experiments with radioactive nuclear beams provide the opportunity to study very short - lived nuclei with extreme neutron to proton ratio n / z .",

    "the main problem in the theoretical description of drip - line nuclei arises from the closeness of the fermi level to the particle continuum : particle - hole and pair excitations reach the continuum .",
    "the coupling between bound states and the particle continuum has to be explicitly included in any model description .",

    ", the theory has been used to perform detailed calculations for a variety of nuclear structure phenomena , as well as for the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "although conventional non - relativistic hartree - fock models and the relativistic mean - field theory predict very similar properties for nuclei close to the @xmath1-stability line , recent applications to the structure of drip - line nuclei have shown significant differences , especially in the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit potential .    in refs .",

    "this will no longer be the case . as opposed to the functions @xmath43 , the lower components @xmath44 are localized functions of * r * , as long as the chemical potential @xmath40 is below the continuum limit .",
    "since the densities are bilinear products of @xmath44 ( see eqs.([equ.2.3.e])-([equ.2.3.h ] ) ) , the system is always localized . according to the theorem of bloch and messiah @xcite , an hfb wave function can be written either in the quasiparticle basis as a product of independent quasi - particle states , or in the _ canonical basis _ as a highly correlated bcs - state . in the _ canonical basis _",
    "nucleons occupy single - particle states . if the chemical potential is close to the continuum , the pairing interaction scatters pairs of nucleons into continuum states . because of additional pairing correlations , particles which occupy those levels can not evaporate .",

    "this sudden increase in neutron @xmath0 radii has been interpreted as evidence for the formation of a multi - particle halo .",

    "the proton density profiles do not change with the number of neutrons , while the neutron density distributions display an abrupt change between @xmath124ne and @xmath125ne .",
    "the microscopic origin of the neutron halo has been found in a delicate balance of the self - consistent mean - field and the pairing field .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1b , where we display the neutron single - particle states 1f@xmath126 , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 in the canonical basis , and the fermi energy as function of the neutron number . for n@xmath129 22 the triplet of states",
    "is high in the continuum , and the fermi level uniformly increases toward zero .",
    "the triplet approaches zero energy , and a gap is formed between these states and all other states in the continuum .",
    "the shell structure dramatically changes at n@xmath130 22 . between n = 22 and n = 32",

    "the pairing interaction promotes neutrons from the 1f@xmath126 orbital to the 2p levels .",
    "since these levels are so close in energy , the total binding energy does not change significantly . due to their small centrifugal barrier",
    ", the 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 orbitals form the halo .",
    "the last bound isotope is @xmath131ne . for n @xmath130 32 ( a@xmath13042 )",

    "a giant halo has been also predicted for zirconium isotopes  @xcite . in that case",
    "the halo originates from the neutron orbitals 2f@xmath126 , 3p@xmath127 and 3p@xmath128 .    in figs . 2 , 3 and 4 we display the neutron single - particle energies in canonical basis for c , n , o , f , ne , na and mg , in the region around neutron number n=20 . in figs .",
    "2 and 3 the left hand side columns display results calculated with the nl1 effective interaction , nl3 results are shown in the central panels , and on the right hand side levels that correspond to the nl - sh parameterization are shown , as function of neutron number . for carbon , in fig .",

    "the nl1 force does not produce a self - consistent solution for the ground states of c isotopes .",
    "we display the energy levels of the triplet of neutron states 1f@xmath126 , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 , the neutron fermi level and , as reference , the occupied orbital 1d@xmath127 .",
    "other states in the continuum , as well as deep hole states , are too far away from the fermi level and therefore not important in the present consideration .",
    "results calculated with different effective interactions are rather similar , and in agreement with our conclusions for ne isotopes : the location of the neutron drip is essentially determined by the triplet 1f@xmath126 , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 .",
    "it appears that nl1 leads to strongest binding , followed by nl3 and nl - sh .",
    "for example , @xmath133o is bound for nl1 and nl3 , but unbound for the nl - sh parameter set . as the neutron number n=20 is approached , for c , n",
    ", o and f the triplet is still high in the continuum , and the pairing interaction does not have enough strength to promote neutrons into these levels . depending on the effective force , the neutron drip is found at n=18 or n=20 . starting from ne , as we have already shown in fig .",
    "1 , the triplet 1f@xmath126 , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 is much lower and neutrons above n=20 begin to fill the 1f@xmath126 orbital . for ne and na , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 are close to the 1f@xmath126 , and therefore they are also populated forming the neutron skin , or eventually the neutron halo . for mg the neutrons",
    "above the @xmath2 shell predominantly populate the 1f@xmath126 orbital , and one expects that deformation plays an important role in the precise location of the neutron drip .",
    "an interesting result is observed if one plots the neutron single - particle levels as function of the number of protons .",
    "this is done in fig . 5 for n=18 ,",
    "n=20 and n=22 isotones .",
    "the levels 2p@xmath127 , 2p@xmath128 , 1f@xmath126 , and 1f@xmath134 , as well as the neutron fermi level , are displayed for the three effective forces . for a given number of neutrons , increasing the proton number means going toward the @xmath1-stability , i.e. away from the neutron drip - line .",
    "the binding increases , as reflected in the negative slope of the fermi level .",
    "what we find very interesting is that the line that corresponds to the fermi level is almost parallel to the 1f@xmath126 level .",
    "it appears that the binding of neutrons in these systems is determined by the position of the 1f@xmath126 orbital .",
    "the levels 2p@xmath127 , 2p@xmath128 , and 1f@xmath134 change very little with z. this is also true for 1g@xmath135 , not shown in the figure , at an energy of @xmath123 20 mev .",
    "on the other hand , the energy of the 1f@xmath126 orbital decreases considerably by adding more protons .",
    "if the spin - orbit splittings are compared , we notice that the energy difference for the doublet 2p@xmath127 - 2p@xmath128 is almost constant as function of z , while a very strong isospin dependence is observed for 1f@xmath126 - 1f@xmath134 .",
    "this is the crucial point and requires a careful explanation . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit interaction for ne and mg isotopes .",
    "we have shown that the corresponding term in the potential is strongly reduced when going toward the drip - line .",
    "this reduction is especially pronounced in the surface region , and consequently one should observe a more diffuse surface . since the densities of the @xmath136 orbitals are located on the surface , while those of the @xmath137 orbitals are contained in the bulk of the nucleus , the effect of reduction of the spin - orbit interaction will be much stronger for the 1f@xmath126 - 1f@xmath134 doublet .    in fig .",

    "the surface thickness decreases from 2.8 fm to 2.33 fm , and the diffuseness parameter decreases from 0.64 fm to 0.55 fm .",
    "we have shown the vector densities .",
    "however , the scalar densities display the same radial dependence .",
    "this means that the scalar potential @xmath144 and the vector potential @xmath145 behave in the same way in the surface region , i.e. both potentials display the same diffuseness .",
    "these large changes in surface properties reflect the reduction of the spin - orbit term of the potential . in relativistic mean - field approximation",
    ", the spin - orbit potential originates from the addition of two large fields : the field of the vector mesons ( short range repulsion ) , and the scalar field of the sigma meson ( intermediate attraction ) . in the first order approximation , and assuming spherical symmetry , the spin orbit term can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the spin - orbit potential  @xcite @xmath148 v and s denote the repulsive vector and the attractive scalar potentials , respectively .",
    "@xmath149 is the effective mass @xmath150 using the vector and scalar potentials from the nl3 self - consistent ground - state solutions , we have computed from  ( [ so1 ] ) - ( [ so3 ] ) the spin - orbit terms for the n=20 isotones .",

    "9 we compare the neutron @xmath0 radii for na isotopes with recent experimental data from ref .",
    "theoretical values correspond to ground - state densities calculated with the nl3 effective interaction , and the d1s parameters for the gogny interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "the blocking procedure has been used both for protons and neutrons . with the possible exceptions of n=11",
    ", the theoretical values nicely reproduce the experimental data , much better than the rmf parameter set that has been used in ref .",
    "the neutron @xmath0 radii display a uniform increase . unlike in the case of ne ,",
    "no sudden change in the radii is observed . instead of the neutron halo , what we observe in na isotopes",
    "is more probably the formation of the neutron skin .",

    "the smooth increase of @xmath152 after n=11 presents evidence for a large neutron skin .",
    "of course , this does not prevent the formation of the halo for heavier na isotopes .",
    "the discrepancy of the calculated and measured @xmath153 for n=11 probably comes from the fact that for this isotope the proton and neutron numbers are identical , and therefore both the odd proton and odd neutron occupy the @xmath2 orbitals with the same probabilities .",
    "one should expect a short range interaction , possibly proton - neutron pairing .",
    "such an interaction would lower the total energy , and the resulting radius should be smaller .",
    "an explicit proton - neutron interaction is not included in the theoretical model , and therefore the calculated neutron radius is larger than the experimental value .",
    "in the present work we have investigated properties of light nuclei with large neutron excess . neutron - rich nuclei between carbon and magnesium have recently become available in experiments with radioactive nuclear beams , and therefore it is very important to study the properties that various theoretical models predict for this region .",
    "we have calculated ground state properties using the relativistic hartree bogoliubov theory . based on the relativistic mean - field model on one side , and the hfb theory on the other",
    ", rhb provides a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations .",
    "it describes the nucleus as a relativistic system of baryons and fermions .",
    "pairing correlations are described by finite range two - body forces . very little is known about the @xmath105 component of the effective interaction in relativistic models , and therefore we have used a finite range interaction of gogny - type .",
    "finite element methods have been used in the coordinate space discretization of the coupled system of dirac - hartree - bogoliubov integro - differential eigenvalue equations , and klein - gordon equations for the meson fields . coordinate space solutions are essential for a correct description of particle - hole and pair excitations into the continuum . for the mean - field lagrangian",
    "we have used the well established effective interactions nl1 , nl3 and nl - sh , and the d1s parameter set for the finite range gogny type interaction in the pairing channel . in particular",
    ", we have investigated the location of the neutron drip - line as function of the number of protons .",
    "model calculations have shown that the triplet of single - particle states near the neutron fermi level : 1f@xmath126 , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 , and the neutron pairing interaction determine the location of the neutron drip - line , the formation of the neutron skin , or eventually of the neutron halo . for c , n , o and f the triplet is still high in the continuum at n=20 , and the pairing interaction is to weak to promote pairs of neutrons into these levels .",
    "all mean - field effective interactions predict similar results , and the neutron drip is found at n=18 or n=20 . for ne ,",
    "na , and mg the states 1f@xmath126 , 2p@xmath127 and 2p@xmath128 are much lower in energy , and for n@xmath130 20 the neutrons populate these levels .",
    "the neutron drip can change by as much as twelve neutrons .",
    "the model predicts the formation of neutron skin , and eventually neutron halo in ne and na .",
    "this is due to the fact that the triplet of states is almost degenerate in energy for n@xmath130 20 .",
    "for mg the 1f@xmath126 lies deeper and neutrons above the @xmath2 shell will exclusively populate this level , resulting in a deformation of the mean field .",
    "when we plot the neutron single - particle levels as function of the number of protons , it turns out that the binding of neutrons is determined by the 1f@xmath126 orbital which is found to be parallel to the slope of the fermi level .",
    "the reduction of the spin - orbit splitting 1f@xmath126 - 1f@xmath134 close to the neutron - drip line has been related to the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "density distributions have been analyzed , and the resulting surface thickness and diffuseness parameter reflect the reduction of the spin - orbit term of the effective potential in the surface region of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "model calculations reproduce the recent experimental data on the neutron @xmath0 radii for na isotopes .      * self - consistent solution for the mean - field in order to obtain the correct increase of the surface diffuseness , * the correct isospin dependence of the spin - orbit term in the mean - field potential . at present only relativistic models",
    "provide reliable results for the characteristic spacings of single particle levels at the fermi surface .",
    "* pairing correlations describe the scattering of nucleon pairs for states close to the fermi surface .",
    "pairing leads to the partial occupation of single particle levels with low orbital angular momentum .",
    "* pairing correlations in the continuum should be described by rhb in coordinate space , with finite - range pairing interaction . in this procedure",
    "the scattering of nucleon pairs does not lead to unbound configurations .",
    "thus relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory in coordinate space provides an appropriate framework in which properties of exotic nuclei on both sides of the valley of @xmath1-stability can be studied . however , to calculate ground - state properties of heavier nuclei beyond na or mg , deformations of the mean - field have to be taken into account .",
    "the inclusion of deformation in the coordinate space formulation of rhb with finite range pairing still presents considerable difficulties .",
    "it is also clear that the details of the scattering processes around the fermi surface , and the partial occupation of levels with low orbital angular momentum in the continuum , are determined by the strength and functional dependence of pairing correlations .",
    "as long as a fully microscopic derivation of an effective pairing in nuclei is not available , it is justified to use a phenomenological interaction , as for example the gogny force .",
    "another open problem is whether one needs a density dependent pairing interaction .",
