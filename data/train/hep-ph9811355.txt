    "in recent work  @xcite , techniques have been developed which set the stage for the `` top - down '' analysis of a class of quasi - realistic string models .",
    "models in this class have @xmath8 supersymmetry , the sm gauge group as a part of the gauge structure , and candidate fields for the three generations of quarks and leptons as well as two electroweak higgs doublets .",
    "such quasi - realistic models have been constructed in weakly coupled heterotic superstring theory in a variety of constructions  @xcite ; in particular , we consider a class of free fermionic models  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "these quasi - realistic free fermionic models have an extended gauge group ( including a non - abelian  hidden \" sector gauge group and a number of additional @xmath9 s ) , and a large number of fields in addition to the mssm fields , which include a number of non - abelian singlets , fields which transform under the hidden sector gauge group , and sm exotics",
    ". these models also have the important property that the superpotential is calculable , in principle to all orders in the nonrenormalizable terms .",
    "the trilinear terms in the superpotential have large yukawa couplings of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the gauge coupling at the string scale .",
    "in contrast to general field - theoretic models , additional string ( worldsheet ) symmetries can forbid terms allowed by gauge invariance  .",
    "these models generically possess an `` anomalous '' @xmath9 at the level of the effective theory .",
    "the presence of the anomalous @xmath9 leads to the generation of a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term at genus one ; this term triggers scalar fields to acquire string - scale vev s along @xmath12 and @xmath13 flat directions , leading to a  restabilization \" of the string vacuum .",
    "thus , as the necessary first step in the analysis , we developed techniques  @xcite to classify the @xmath12 flat directions which can be proven to be @xmath13 flat to all orders of a general perturbative heterotic superstring model with an anomalous @xmath9 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we chose to consider flat directions formed of non - abelian singlets only , and selected the singlet fields with zero hypercharge to preserve the sm gauge group .",
    "we applied our method to a prototype string model , model 5 of  @xcite ( chl5 ) , in  @xcite , and more recently to a number of free fermionic string models in  @xcite .",
    "the next step in the analysis of this class of models is to analyze the effective theory along such flat directions . in general , the rank of the gauge group is reduced , and effective couplings are induced by the coupling of the fields in the flat direction to the rest of the fields in the model .",
    "the effective mass terms generated in this way will give some of the fields superheavy masses , so that they decouple from the theory at the string scale .",
    "in addition to the trilinear couplings of the original superpotential , effective trilinear terms are generated from higher - dimensional terms for the remaining light fields ; such couplings can have important implications for the phenomenology of the model  .    in a recent work  @xcite we studied in detail the physics implications of the effective theory after vacuum restabilization for a prototype model : model 5 of @xcite ( chl5 ) .",
    "the mass spectrum and the effective trilinear terms ( in the observable sector ) were calculated exactly at the string tree level and to all orders in the vacuum expectation value of the fields in the flat directions for all of the flat directions classified in  @xcite .",
    "however , we presented the detailed analysis for two representative flat directions , which encompass the general features of this class of flat directions .",
    "these two flat directions are part of a subset of flat directions of the model which break the maximal number of @xmath9 s , leaving an additional non - anomalous @xmath0 as well as the sm gauge group unbroken at the string scale ( as well as the hidden sector gauge groups ) .",
    "importantly , the string worldsheet symmetries forbid many of the gauge - allowed terms in the effective theory , which has a number of implications for the phenomenology of the model .    the calculation of the mass spectrum revealed that along with the mssm fields , there remain a large number of massless exotic superfields at the string scale , due to the absence of the corresponding effective mass terms in the superpotential .",
    "these fields include additional electroweak doublets and electrically charged singlets , leading to a larger number of fields in the observable sector in this model than in the mssm .",
    "while the scalar fields can acquire masses from the supersymmetry breaking , their fermionic superpartners can remain light compared with the electroweak scale .",
    "we also found that many of the massless exotic fields do not couple directly to the observable sector fields at the order of the effective trilinear superpotential , such that they do not participate in the radiative electroweak and @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , there is no mechanism for these exotic fields to acquire masses .",
    "the additional massless particle content has an impact on gauge coupling unification , and renders the hidden sector gauge groups non - asymptotically free ( such that there is no possibility of dynamical supersymmetry breaking in this sector due to strong coupling dynamics ) .",
    "the presence of massless exotics seems to be generic and thus it is a serious obstacle for deriving phenomenologically acceptable physics from these models .",
    "nevertheless , they have enough realistic features that it is worthwhile to study in detail the implications of the effective trilinear terms of the superpotential .",
    "these terms have a number of concrete implications for the observable sector physics .",
    "in particular , the effective third order superpotential does not have a canonical @xmath6 term ( involving the standard electroweak higgs doublets ) in either example , but instead non - canonical @xmath6 terms involving some of the additional higgs doublets .",
    "such non - canonical terms suffice for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , in these examples , there are not enough such terms to involve all of the higgs doublets , resulting in massless charginos , neutralinos and an unwanted global @xmath9 .",
    "we found that when imposing the requirement that there are three lepton doublets in the model , @xmath14- parity is not conserved due to the presence of @xmath15- violating terms which leads to possible lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) decay in both of the examples .",
    "the second representative flat direction also has @xmath16- violating terms ( with implications for proton decay ) , as well as couplings which yield textures in the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take the phenomenological analysis of these models to the next stage : to determine the low energy implications of these string vacua for the gauge symmetry breaking patterns and the analysis of the low energy mass spectra .",
    "specifically , we investigate in detail the nature of the electroweak and @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking patterns and the accompanying mass spectrum . again , we choose to carry out this analysis for these two representative flat directions .",
    "such an analysis can only be performed after supersymmetry breaking has been incorporated .",
    "since the origin of the supersymmetry breaking in string theory is not well understood , no quantitative , phenomenologically viable derivation of a supersmmetry breaking pattern is available .",
    "thus we take a modest approach and parameterize the supersymmetry breaking by introducing soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms at the string scale",
    ". we can then proceed with the study of the renormalization group evolution of all the parameters in the observable sector and the study of their implications for the low - energy physics .",
    "although the mass spectrum and the effective trilinear superpotential for the representative flat directions of the chl5 model are not realistic due to the additional massless exotics and the nature of the effective trilinear couplings ( for details see  @xcite ) , we choose to focus on the light fields which participate in the gauge symmetry breaking , with the goal of obtaining scenarios with a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy .",
    "as shown in @xcite , in this class of models the breaking scale of the @xmath0 can be either at the electroweak ( tev ) scale , or at an intermediate scale , depending on the @xmath0 charges and trilinear couplings of the massless sm singlet fields . in the first representative flat direction",
    ", the massless particle content at the string scale does not allow for the intermediate scale @xmath0 breaking scenario , and hence the breaking is at the electroweak scale . however , both scenarios are possible for the second representative flat direction .    in this paper , we demonstrate these symmetry breaking scenarios explicitly for each of the two representative flat directions .",
    "numerical results are presented for specific ( typical ) choices of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the string scale , which in turn yield a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy .",
    "we calculate the low energy spectrum explicitly with the emphasis on the study of the higgs mass spectrum and contrast its features with those of both the mssm , and the `` bottom - up '' analysis of the string models with an additional @xmath0 studied in  @xcite .",
    "( for the first flat direction the complete mass spectrum , including that of the supersymmetric partners , is presented .",
    "for the second flat direction we specifically address the texture in the ( bottom ) quark sector . ) due to the fact that the number of higgs fields participating in the symmetry breaking pattern is larger than that assumed in @xcite , the presence of some ( but not all possible ) non - canonical @xmath6 terms implies additional massless charginos , neutralinos , and higgs bosons as well as new patterns in the massive higgs spectrum .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ ii ] , we summarize the features of the chl5 model and define the two specific flat directions . in section [ iii ] , we present the mass spectrum and the effective trilinear superpotential couplings for the first flat direction of the chl5 model .",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of realistic electroweak symmetry breaking scenarios of the sm gauge group along with the additional @xmath0 . in section [ iv ]",
    "we demonstrate the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scenarios at both the electroweak and intermediate scales for the second representative flat direction .",
    "finally , in section [ v ] we present the summary and conclusions .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is the effective theory along the two representative flat directions of the chl5 model  @xcite . in previous work ,",
    "we have presented techniques for classifying the flat directions  @xcite and demonstrated the calculation of the effective couplings along these `` restabilized vacua '' of the model  @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we summarize the method and the results here , and refer the reader to @xcite for the details .      in the class of quasi - realistic string models considered , there is an anomalous @xmath9 generically present as part of the gauge structure , for which the anomalies are cancelled by the four - dimensional version of the green schwarz mechanism .",
    "this standard anomaly cancellation mechanism leads to the generation of a nonzero fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) contribution @xmath17 to the @xmath12 term of @xmath18 , with @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is related to the gauge coupling @xmath11 by the relation @xmath21",
    "@xcite ( @xmath11 is normalized according to the standard ( gut ) conventions , i.e. , @xmath22 for the generators of the fundamental representation of @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the reduced planck mass , with @xmath25 gev .",
    "this term would appear to break supersymmetry in the original string vacuum .",
    "however , it triggers certain scalar fields to acquire vev s of @xmath26 along @xmath12 and @xmath13 flat directions , leading to a supersymmetric  restabilized \" string vacuum .",
    "therefore , the classification of the flat directions is the necessary first step in the analysis of the string model . in @xcite , we presented techniques to classify a subset of @xmath12 flat directions which can be proven to be @xmath13 flat to all orders in the superpotential .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and to preserve the sm gauge group at the string scale , we chose to analyze flat directions formed from non - abelian singlet fields with zero hypercharge .",
    "in general , the fi term sets the scale of the vev s in the flat direction , although in some cases some of the vev s are undetermined ( but bounded from above ) .",
    "the next stage of the analysis is to determine the effective theory along such flat directions  @xcite . in general , the rank of the gauge group will be reduced ( i.e. , several @xmath9 s will be broken ) .",
    "effective couplings can be generated from higher - dimensional operators in the superpotential after replacing the fields in the flat direction by their vev s .",
    "in particular , for a given flat direction @xmath27 , effective mass terms for the fields @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) may be generated via @xmath31 in addition to these mass terms arising from @xmath13 terms , the fields in the flat direction with vev s set by the fi term will acquire masses from @xmath12 terms via the superhiggs mechanism . the fields with such effective mass terms will acquire string - scale masses and decouple from the theory .",
    "in addition to the trilinear couplings of the original superpotential , effective renormalizable interactions for the light fields may also be generated via @xmath32 the existence of such terms was determined first by identifying the gauge invariant effective bilinear and trilinear terms , then subsequently verifying that such gauge invariant terms survive the string selection rules .",
    "the coupling strengths of the effective trilinear terms generated in this way will generally be suppressed compared to the large yukawa couplings of the original superpotential , which have coupling strengths @xmath10 ( with the typical value given by @xmath33 for the models considered , as is discussed in section iii ) . in general , the coefficients of the superpotential terms of order @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a coefficient of @xmath37 which includes different renormalization factors in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the string vertex operators ( including the target space gauge group clebsch - gordan coefficients ) , and @xmath38 is a world - sheet integral .",
    "@xmath39 for certain typical couplings , have been computed numerically by several authors , with the typical result @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the coupling strengths of the effective trilinear terms depend on these coefficients and the values of the vev s involved , which are set by the ( model - dependent ) fi term . in this way",
    ", these couplings can naturally provide a hierarchy , with implications for generating fermion textures in the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "the model we have chosen as a prototype model to analyze is model 5 of @xcite . prior to vacuum restabilization , the model has the gauge group @xmath42 and a particle content that includes the following chiral superfields in addition to the mssm fields : @xmath43 where the representation under @xmath44 is indicated .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for the complete list of fields with their @xmath9 charges .",
    "the sm hypercharge is determined as a linear combination of the six non - anomalous @xmath9 s , subject to the conditions that the mssm fields have the appropriate quantum numbers , and that the remaining fields can be grouped into mirror pairs under @xmath45 ( in the attempt to avoid the presence of strictly massless colored or charged fermion fields in the theory ) . in this model ,",
    "these criteria lead to a unique definition of @xmath45 @xcite , with ka - moody level @xmath46 ( to be compared with the mssm value of @xmath47 ) .",
    "we presented a complete list of the @xmath12 flat directions which can be proven to be @xmath13 flat to all orders in the superpotential in  @xcite , and written more explicitly in table ii in  @xcite . in  @xcite , we analyzed the @xmath48 subset of the flat directions , which includes the two representative directions @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the maximum number of @xmath9 s is broken in these flat directions , which leave an additional @xmath0 as well as @xmath45 unbroken  @xcite .",
    "the unbroken @xmath0 has @xmath51 .",
    "the complete list of fields with their @xmath45 and @xmath0 charges is presented in tables ia - ic .",
    "the vev s of the fields in the most general @xmath48 flat direction are of the form [ vevs ]    lcl |_27|^2=2x^2 , & & |_28(29)|^2=x^2-|_1|^2 , +         with [ xdef ] x==0.013m_pl , and @xmath52 are free vev s of the moduli space , subject to the restrictions that @xmath53 .    the first representative flat direction @xmath49 has vev s given by the general case ( [ vevs ] ) , with no further restrictions on @xmath52 .",
    "however , the second representative flat direction @xmath50 corresponds to the case in which constraints must be imposed on the free vev s in such a way that the contributions from different @xmath13 terms cancel and @xmath54 ; these constraints are @xmath55 , and @xmath56 phase difference between the combination of vev s @xmath57 and @xmath58  @xcite .    for each of these flat directions , we computed the effective mass terms and determined the mass eigenstates in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fields which become massive from these couplings , it can be shown that of the fields in each flat direction , five of the associated chiral superfields become massive due to the superhiggs mechanism . in the @xmath49 flat direction ,",
    "two of the chiral superfields remain massless ( moduli ) , but they do not couple to the rest of the fields at the level of the effective trilinear terms . in the @xmath50 flat direction , the remaining complex field gets a mass of order [ yukawa ] @xmath59 [ field vev ] due to cancellations of @xmath13 term contributions and forms , along with its superpartner , a massive chiral superfield . in this case , the fields with zero vev s which couple linearly in these terms also acquire masses of the same order .",
    "the effective trilinear couplings along each of the representative flat directions were also determined in  @xcite . in this model , the numerical analysis ( see also @xcite ) of the string amplitudes yields , along with the @xmath60 as the typical vev of the fields along the flat direction , the effective yukawa coupling at the fourth order @xmath61 , while the fifth order terms have strengths @xmath62 ( using the typical values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite . ) therefore , in this model the effective trilinear couplings arising from fourth order terms are competitive in strength to the elementary trilinear terms , while the higher order contributions are indeed suppressed @xcite . of course , the precise values for each term will depend on the particular fields involved .",
    "in addition , the coupling strengths can depend on the undetermined vev s in the @xmath49 flat direction .",
    "the @xmath49 direction involves the set of fields @xmath65 .",
    "the vev s correspond to the most general case given in ( [ vevs ] ) , such that they depend on two free ( but bounded ) parameters .    it is straightforward to determine the mass eigenstates , which were calculated in  @xcite . in table",
    "ii we list the surviving massless states .",
    "these states include both the usual mssm states and related exotic ( non - chiral under @xmath66 ) states , such as a fourth ( @xmath66 singlet ) down - type quark , extra fields with the same quantum numbers as the lepton singlet superfields , and extra higgs doublets .",
    "there are other massless states with exotic quantum numbers ( including fractional electric charge ) , and states which are non - abelian representations under both the hidden and observable sector gauge groups and thus directly mix the two sectors . as previously discussed , there are two additional massless states ( moduli ) associated with fields which appear in the flat direction but which do not have fixed vev s ( but do not couple to other fields at the level of an effective trilinear term ) and are not listed in table ii .",
    "the effective trilinear couplings involving the observable sector fields assume the form  @xcite : @xmath67h_{3}h_{7}\\varphi_{20 }   % + \\frac{\\sqrt{2 } x^3}{m_{pl}^3 } % \\left[\\alpha^{(3)}_{6}\\lambda_2 ^ 2 + % \\alpha^{(4)}_{6}(\\lambda_1 ^ 2-\\lambda_2 ^ 2)\\right ] % h_{4}h_{5}\\varphi_{20},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath68 are free parameters and @xmath69 , with @xmath70 x     /(\\sqrt{2}g m_{pl})$ ] .",
    "the superpotential implies generic features independent of the details of the soft supersymmetry breaking , which have been analysed in  @xcite : ( i ) with the identification of the fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 with the standard electroweak higgs doublets , the yukawa couplings indicate @xmath73 and @xmath74 yukawa unification with equal string scale yukawa couplings @xmath11 and @xmath75 , respectively ; ( ii ) there is no elementary or effective canonical @xmath6-term ; ( iii ) there is a possibility of lepton- number violating couplings and thus no stable lsp .",
    "in particular , we identify the fields @xmath76 as the lepton doublets , and hence the couplings @xmath77 and @xmath78 violate lepton number .",
    "the fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 can play the role of additional higgs fields .",
    "@xmath81 has the quantum numbers of a higgs doublet , but does not enter @xmath82 , and hence there is no mechanism for it to develop a vev .      to address the gauge symmetry breaking scenarios for this model , we introduce soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters , and run the rge s from the string scale to the electroweak scale . while the qualitative features of the analysis are independent of the details of the soft breaking , we choose to illustrate the analysis with a specific example with a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy .",
    "we wish to investigate the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scenarios discussed in @xcite , which indicate that in the class of string models considered , the @xmath0 symmetry breaking is either at the electroweak ( tev ) scale , or at an intermediate scale ( if the symmetry breaking takes place along a @xmath12 flat direction ) .",
    "an inspection of the massless spectrum in table ic indicates that the singlet field @xmath83 is required for a @xmath12 flat direction ( and hence the intermediate scale @xmath0 symmetry breaking scenario ) ; however , this field acquires a string - scale mass for this direction , and decouples from the theory .",
    "we conclude that in this case , an intermediate scale breaking scenario is not possible , and hence the breaking of the @xmath0 is necessarily at the electroweak scale .",
    "though hidden sector non - abelian fields are not directly or indirectly coupled to the observable sector non - abelian fields at the trilinear order in the superpotential , the @xmath0 could be radiatively broken along with some of the hidden non - abelian groups , and in such cases the breaking of the hidden sector is connected with the @xmath84 symmetry breaking in the observable sector through @xmath4 .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "several scenarios exist which can lead to the possibility of a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy .",
    "the scenario in which only the two mssm higgs fields @xmath72 , @xmath71 acquire vev s breaks both @xmath45 and @xmath0 , but leads to a light @xmath85 with @xmath86 , which is already excluded by experiments .",
    "to have a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy , we require that a sm singlet field that is charged under the @xmath0 acquires a vev . however , since the canonical @xmath6 term that couples both @xmath87 and @xmath88 to a sm singlet is absent , and instead there is a non - canonical @xmath6 term @xmath89 , the minimization of the potential requires that the additional higgs doublet @xmath79 acquires a non - zero vev .",
    "therefore , we consider the most general case in which @xmath79 and @xmath90 acquire vev s in addition to @xmath71 and @xmath72 . after adding the required soft supersymmetry breaking terms , the potential is given by @xmath91 with @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 in which @xmath95 is the coefficient for the coupling @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 ) , and @xmath99 the @xmath0 charges of @xmath100 are denoted by @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "we can take @xmath105 real and positive without loss of generality by an appropriate choice of the global phases of the fields . by a suitable gauge rotation",
    "we also take @xmath106 and @xmath107 real and positive , which implies that @xmath108 is real and positive at the minimum .",
    "however , the phase of the @xmath72 field is not determined , due to the absence of an effective @xmath6 term involving @xmath72 in ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "this additional global @xmath9 symmetry leads to the presence of a goldstone boson in the massless spectrum , as discussed below . for notational simplicity ,",

    "we found that in general there are a number of superfields which remain massless at the string scale , and that while the scalars acquire masses from the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , within our assumptions there is no mechanism for some of the fermions to acquire masses .",
    "the gauge coupling unification is not realistic ( although better than expected due to the amount of additional matter superfields and the higher ka - moody level in the model ) , and the hidden sector gauge groups are not asymptotically free , thus disallowing an implementation of dynamical supersymmetry breaking scenarios .",
    "in addition , the effective trilinear couplings have a number of nonstandard features which were examined in detail in  @xcite , such as the absence of a canonical effective @xmath6 term , presence of baryon and lepton number violating couplings , as well as ( potentially realistic ) hierarchies of fermion masses .",
    "since the purpose of this program is to explore the general features of this class of quasi - realistic models systematically , and not to search for a specific , fully realistic model ( an unlikely possibility ) , we continue the analysis by investigating the gauge symmetry breaking patterns and the low energy spectrum for the representative examples .",
    "however , this study requires the implementation of supersymmetry breaking , which we parameterize by soft supersymmetry breaking masses put in by hand at the string scale , due to the absence of a satisfactory scenario for supersymmetry breaking in string theory .",
    "this introduces free parameters in the effective theory , and thus the unique predictive power of a particular string vacuum is lost . in particular , the concrete results for the low energy spectrum depend on the initial conditions for the soft masses at the string scale .",
    "we chose to analyze scenarios which lead to a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy ; as argued on general grounds in  @xcite , the breaking scale of the @xmath0 is at the electroweak scale , or at an intermediate scale ( if the symmetry breaking occurs along a @xmath12 flat direction ) . for each representative flat direction",
    "we determine the low energy spectrum explicitly for a typical choice of initial conditions that yield a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy .",
    "the emphasis was on the study of the higgs sector , in order to contrast its features with that encountered in both the mssm and string motivated models with an additional @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in the symmetry breaking scenarios for these two representative examples , the novel feature is that the number of higgs fields that participate in the symmetry breaking is larger than that assumed in @xcite ( there are at least three higgs doublets and one sm singlet participating in the symmetry breaking process ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of some and absence of other non - canonical @xmath6 terms implies new patterns in the low energy mass spectrum .",
    "for the first representative flat direction , the symmetry breaking scale of the @xmath0 is at the electroweak scale , because all of the @xmath0 charged singlets that remain massless at the string scale have charges of the same sign . to obtain a realistic @xmath1 hierarchy , we found it is necessary to have a nonminimal higgs sector , with three higgs doublets and one singlet ( which has a large vev ) .",
    "this scenario can be obtained with mildly nonuniversal soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at the string scale .",
    "we present the complete mass spectrum , including that of the supersymmetric partners , for a typical choice of initial conditions .",
    "the resulting mass spectrum at the electroweak scale includes massless and ultralight charginos , neutralinos , and higgs bosons , due to the absence of enough canonical or non - canonical effective @xmath6 terms . in particular",
    ", the absence of an effective @xmath6 term involving one of the higgs doublets provides an additional global @xmath9 symmetry in the scalar potential that is spontaneously broken , resulting in a goldstone boson present in the low energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , the mass of lightest neutral higgs boson is controlled by the scale of the breakdown of this global symmetry , and thus obeys a different bound than the traditional bound in the mssm .    for the second representative flat direction",
    ", the @xmath0 breaking can be either at the electroweak scale or at an intermediate scale .",
    "once again , the electroweak scale scenario requires an extended higgs sector to obtain a @xmath85 that is consistent with experiment .",
    "in addition , to study the fermion texture in the down - quark sector of this model , additional higgs doublets are needed to acquire vev s .",
    "in contrast to the previous model , there may be cp - violating phases in the higgs sector of the model , though these are absent for the specific example considered .",
    "the electroweak scale symmetry breaking scenario is achievable with mildly nonuniversal boundary conditions .",
    "there is a fairly realistic @xmath396 mass hierarchy , although the absolute scale is much too high .",
    "the corresponding @xmath371 matrix has no mixings of the first two families with the third , and an unrealistic maximal mixing between the first and second generations .",
    "the intermediate scale symmetry breaking scenario can be achieved with mild nonuniversality of the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters , at a range of intermediate scales .",
    "it is purely radiative in origin , because of the absence of the relevant nonrenormalizable terms ( and trilinear terms involving the heavy fields ) in the superpotential .",
    "we plan to address the electroweak symmetry breaking in this scenario after decoupling the heavy fields , which requires a detailed analysis of a class of nonrenormalizable operators , in a future paper .",
    "although the analysis of the low energy implications for the representative examples studied in the paper reveals a number of additional unacceptable phenomenological consequences , it nevertheless demonstrates new features of the gauge symmetry breaking patterns , in particular that associated with the higgs sector of the theory . the type of non - minimal extensions of the higgs sector and their specific couplings , which we encountered in the analysis of the specific string models should be of general interest in the phenomenological investigation of models beyond the mssm , and thus deserves further study .    we would like to thank j. lykken for making available to us the program that generates the massless spectrum of free fermionic string vacua as well as the original program that calculates the superpotential couplings . l.e .",
