    "the theory of cosmological perturbations  @xcite relies essentially on two assumptions , namely that the background is described by pure classical general relativity ( gr ) , while the perturbations thereof stem from quantum fluctuations , although they are subsequently evolved classically . quite apart from the computational usefulness of this scheme ,",
    "this state of affairs is rather incomplete , and one would expect instead a fully quantum treatment of both the background and the perturbations to be achievable .",
    "in fact , the overwhelming majority of classical backgrounds possess an initial singularity at which the classical theory is expected to break down . in recent years",
    ", many quantum background cosmological models have been proposed , which share the attractive property of exhibiting neither singularities nor horizons  @xcite , leading the universe evolution through a bouncing phase due to quantum effects , and a contracting phase from infinity before the bounce .",
    "these new features of the background introduce a new picture for the evolution of cosmological perturbations : vacuum initial conditions may now be imposed when the universe was very big and almost flat , and effects due to the contracting and bouncing phases , which are not present in the standard background model , may change the subsequent evolution of perturbations in the expanding phase . hence",
    ", it is quite important to study the evolution of perturbations in these quantum backgrounds .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a step in this direction by considering tensor perturbations in quantum minisuperspace background solutions . interpreting the quantum theory in an ontological way  @xcite allows to define quantum scale factor trajectories , which can then be used in the second order tensorial modes perturbation equations as show in ref .",

    "the bounce phase has recently been the subject of a lot of attention , in particular in view of the fact that in many instances , it was found to have the ability to modify the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations , thus paving the way to confront them to the observational data  @xcite . in the case of bounces in quantum cosmological",
    "models , although the evolution equations for the perturbations may be constructed  @xcite , they are rather complicated due to the fact that the background does not satisfy classical einstein s equations . hence , all works in this area had to rely on a semiclassical approximation .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the gravitational wave background spectrum produced at the bounce transition when this phase is described by a perfect fluid and the theory is fully quantized : this is the first time such a calculation , not involving any semiclassical approximation is performed .",
    "the restriction to gravitational waves stems from the fact that the perturbation equations for this type of modes can be substantially simplified , even when the background is quantized  @xcite .",
    "scalar and vector modes , however , exhibit technical difficulties which have not been solved yet , so that tensor modes are , for the time being , the only modes that can be studied in a completely quantum way .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "thus , the mode crosses the potential only in this case .",
    "this constraint is however satisfied for the situations we are interested in , namely , @xmath77 and @xmath175 .",
    "one then obtains @xmath181 we have two limiting cases , namely @xmath182 and @xmath183 yielding , respectively , latexmath:[\\[\\label{etamg }    latexmath:[\\[\\label{etamp }     the effect of the potential for @xmath137 is to increase its amplitude by a factor shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : mukm1 ] , as well as to mix the exponential terms .",
    "this can be easily seen by the following approximation .",
    "for @xmath77 , the maximum of the effective potential at @xmath90 is very large while for @xmath185 it behaves like @xmath186 , which goes to zero when @xmath187 .",
    "hence the effective potential ( [ veffk ] ) can be well approximated to a dirac delta in this limit .",
    "its integration reads @xmath188^{-2}\\cr & & \\cr & = & \\frac{\\left(\\eta_0 ^ 2 + 1\\right ) \\sinh\\left(2\\eta\\right)}{2\\left[\\left(\\eta_0 ^ 2 - 1\\right ) + \\left(\\eta_0 ^ 2 + 1\\right ) \\cosh\\left(2\\eta\\right)\\right ] } \\cr & & \\cr & & + \\frac{1-\\eta_0 ^ 2}{2\\eta_0 } \\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{\\tanh\\eta}{\\eta_0}\\right ) , \\label{veffint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies @xmath189 where in the last step we have assumed that @xmath77 .    hence , one can approximate the effective potential by a dirac distribution  @xcite @xmath190 .",
    "the solution for @xmath191 is then simply eq .",
    "( [ mu_ini ] ) with @xmath16 substituted by @xmath163 for @xmath192 , and @xmath193 for @xmath194 .",
    "demanding that @xmath137 be continuous across the potential and imposing eq .",
    "( [ muk ] ) then leads to another matching condition , namely @xmath195 one then finds that @xmath196 and finally , in the long wavelength approximation for which @xmath175 , that @xmath197 .",
    "this is exactly what is obtained numerically , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : mukm1 ] . note also that when the curves reach the @xmath198 region , the amplitude is the initial one : the mode has not crossed the potential as explained above .",
    "note incidentally that solution ( [ coef ] ) is exatly the same as the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper for radiation with @xmath199 , where we used the matching method .",
    "this is because also in this case one can approximate the potential to a dirac distribution as @xmath200 when @xmath185 , which goes to zero in the limit @xmath201 .",
    "however , for the parabolic scale factor @xmath202 $ ] also treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which solutions are quite different from ( [ coef ] ) , the potential is @xmath203 , whose limit for @xmath185 is @xmath204 , independent of @xmath71 . hence in this case , the effective potential can not be approximated by a dirac distribution , and the final spectrum is very different .",
    "we thus confirm that the power spectrum of perturbations through a bounce may depend significantly of the details of the bounce itself .    with the coefficients ( [ coef ] )",
    ", one can calculate the spectrum @xmath205 for the two possible matching points ( [ etamg],[etamp ] ) , yielding @xmath206 and @xmath207 . note that , as expected , the case @xmath183 yields the same spectrum as the flat case : the two scale factors are quite similar in that limit .",
    "we have obtained the power spectrum of tensor perturbations in bouncing quantum cosmological models with a perfect fluid satisfying @xmath5 for flat spatial sections and @xmath208 , and for curved spatial sections with @xmath209 . for flat spatial sections ,",
    "the spectral index for large wavelengths is @xmath210 .",
    "the positive curved spatial section model is unstable , while the negative curved spatial section model amplifies the modes , changing the amplitude to a power index of @xmath211 or @xmath212 , depending on the parameters .",
    "all cases lead to oscillations in the primordial spectrum .",
    "the most interesting case is the one of radiation , which is the best perfect fluid model for the early universe ( all particles are ultra - relativistic ) . for almost flat spatial sections we have @xmath213 , which is different from the predictions of inflation .",
    "hence , this model can be potentially tested against inflation in future observations , specially concerning the polarization of the cosmic microwave background , planck observations , and gravitational wave detectors if we calculate the amplitude of these perturbations .",
    "the next step would be to calculate the spectrum of scalar perturbations of these models .",
    "the dynamical equations for scalar perturbations are not , however , as simple as eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) .",
    "the steps we have taken in sec .",
    "( 2 ) in order to arrive at eq .  ( [ mu ] ) in the case where the background is also quantized are not so simple in the case of scalar perturbations , specially due to the matter terms .",
    "this is work in progress .",
    "attainment of the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is crucial not only to test the model against wmap observations , but also to calibrate and obtain the precise spectrum of tensor perturbations for possible comparisons with ligo and virgo future data .",
