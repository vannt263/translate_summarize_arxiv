    "the hunt for higgs bosons is one of the most important goals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . on the 4th of july 2012",
    ", cern announced that both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments presented very strong evidence for a new higgs - like boson with mass around 125 gev . with the growingly accumulated date ,",
    "the properties of this particle are consistent with those of higgs boson predicted by the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "though the lhc offers obvious advantages in proving very high energy and very large rates in typical reactions , the measuring precision will be restricted due to the complicated background .",
    "however , the most precise measurements will be performed in the clean environment of the future @xmath7 colliders , like the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known , the main production processes of the higgs boson in @xmath7 collisions are the higgs - strahlung process @xmath1 and the @xmath13 fusion process @xmath14 .",
    "the cross section for the higgs - strahlung process is dominant at the low energy . for @xmath15 gev",
    ", the cross section for the @xmath13 fusion is dominant .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath16 fusion process @xmath3 increases significantly with the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy increasing , and can exceeds that of @xmath17 production around 1 tev .",
    "these three processes can be well used to test the higgs - gauge couplings .",
    "the large top quark yukawa coupling is speculated to be sensitive to new physics , it can be studied through the associated production of higgs boson with top quark pairs @xmath18 at the ilc .",
    "this study will play an important role for precision measurements of the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "in addition , the higgs self - coupling is the key ingredient of the higgs potential and their measurement is indispensable for understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the higgs self - coupling can be studied through the double higgs boson production processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the ilc . and",
    "many relevant works mentioned above have been extensively studies in the context of the sm @xcite and some new physics models @xcite .    as an extension of the sm ,",
    "the left - right twin higgs ( lrth ) model has been proposed as an alternative solution to the little hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "the idea of twin higgs similar to that of little higgs , in that the sm - like higgs emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "the twin higgs mechanism can be implemented in lrth model with the discrete symmetry being identified with left - right symmetry .",
    "the phenomenology of the lrth model has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the lrth model , some new particles",
    "are predicted and some sm couplings are modified so that the higgs properties may deviate from the sm higgs boson .",
    "so the higgs boson processes are ideal ways to probe the lrth model at the @xmath7 colliders . in this paper",
    ", we mainly study the higgs boson production processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath18 , @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "besides , we consider the major decay modes of the higgs boson @xmath8(@xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 in the lrth model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly review the basic content of the lrth model related to our work .",
    "in sec.iii and sec.iv we respectively investigate the higgs boson production and decay processes , and give the numerical results and discussions .",
    "finally , we give a short conclusion in sec.v .",
    "in this section , we will study the contributions of the lrth model to three different types of higgs boson production processes at @xmath7 colliders separately . in our calculations ,",
    "the sm input parameters are taken from ref .",
    "we take the sm - like higgs mass as @xmath40 gev .",
    "the lrth parameters involved in the amplitudes are the breaking scale @xmath34 , the masses @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the mixing parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the masses @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are correlated to @xmath34 and @xmath33 , and parts of their values are listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the value of the mixing parameter @xmath33 is constrained by the @xmath44 branching ratio and oblique parameters @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we take small @xmath33 and pick two typical values of @xmath45 0 and @xmath33= 150 .",
    "0.8pt 0.1 in    .",
    "the masses ( in gev ) of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 used in this paper . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     recently , the atlas collaboration presented the results that a narrow resonance with sm @xmath46 couplings to fermions is excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "for masses less than 2.79 tev in the dielectron channel , 2.53 tev in the dimuon channel , and 2.90 tev in the two channels combined @xcite . and presented the limit on a grand - unification model based on the @xmath47 gauge group , a spin-2 graviton excitation from randall - sundrum models , etc .",
    "the same thing has also been explored by the cms collaboration and a sequential sm @xmath48 resonance lighter than 2.59 tev @xcite is excluded at 95% c.l ..    in order to constrain the mass of @xmath0 from the lrth model , we show the observed and expected 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion limits on @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 ) as a function of @xmath51 at the lhc in fig.[fig : limit ] , where the observed and expected exclusion limits come from ref .",
    "we have checked the production process @xmath52 and the decay @xmath53 , and found that our results were consistent with those in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the fig .",
    "[ fig : limit ] , we can see that the limits on the @xmath51 are insensitive to @xmath33 . in two cases ,",
    "the @xmath51 are both required to be larger than 2.76 tev , this is corresponding to the scale @xmath54 920 gev for @xmath55 and @xmath54 900 gev for @xmath56 , which are much stronger than the constraints from the lhc higgs data @xcite .    meanwhile , there are many searches on the heavy top partners have been performed by both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations .",
    "the results show that @xmath24 quarks with masses below 745 gev are excluded at 95% c.l . for exclusive decays of @xmath57 . for different decay modes of the @xmath24 quark",
    ", the resulting mass limits range from 697 gev , for br(@xmath58 ) = 20% and br(@xmath59 ) = 80% , to 782 gev for br(@xmath58 ) = 100% .",
    "however , the top quark parter @xmath24 in the lrth model can decay into @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and more than 70% of heavy top decays via @xmath65",
    ". the branching ratios of the other decays modes are suppressed since the relevant couplings are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath66 . in the limit @xmath55 , the only two body decay mode is @xmath67 with a branching ratio of 100% @xcite .",
    "thus , the current constraint on the top partner will be relaxed in the lrth model .",
    "in addition , we have checked that the limit of the scale @xmath54 900 gev satisfies the limit from the searches of @xmath24 quark .      in the lrth model ,",
    "the lowest - order feynman diagrams of the processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eezh ] . in comparison with the sm",
    ", we can see that the tree - level feynman diagrams of these processes in the lrth model receive the additional contributions arising from the heavy gauge boson @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - zh](a ) , we show the production cross section @xmath68 of the three processes as functions of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath69 for the scale @xmath70 gev in the lrth model .",
    "we can see that the higgs strahlung process @xmath1 attains its maximum at @xmath71 gev , the cross section for @xmath17 process is in proportion to @xmath72 and dominates the fusion process at the low energies . while the cross section for @xmath2 rises as log(@xmath73 ) and dominates at high energies .",
    "the @xmath74 and @xmath75 production cross sections increase with the c.m .",
    "energy and can respectively take over that of the @xmath17 process at @xmath15 gev and @xmath76 gev , where the cross section for the process @xmath75 is suppressed by an order of magnitude compared with the process @xmath74 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - zh](b ) , we show the relative correction @xmath77 of the three production channels as functions of the scale @xmath34 for @xmath78 gev , respectively , where @xmath79 is defined as @xmath80 .",
    "we can see that the values of the relative corrections decrease with the scale @xmath34 increasing , which indicates that the effects of the lrth model will decouple at the high scale @xmath34 . in the same parameter space",
    ", the three curves also demonstrate the process @xmath1 has the largest relative correction , which can maximally reach 5.3% when the scale @xmath34 is as low as 900 gev .    for the process @xmath1 , the 250(500 ) gev run of the ilc can measure the cross section to a relative accuracy of 2.5(3.0)% at 250(500 ) fb@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "in addition , an even more remarkable precision of 0.4% may be achieved at the recently proposed triple - large electron - positron collider ( tlep)@xcite , which is a new circular @xmath7 collider operated at @xmath69=240 gev with @xmath82 fb@xmath81 integrated luminosity . for the process @xmath2",
    ", the ilc can measure this cross section times the branching fraction to @xmath83 to a statistical accuracy of about 0.6% @xcite at 500 gev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath81 .",
    "for the process",
    "@xmath3 , we can see that the relative correction to the cross section of this process is very small in the lrth model .",
    "meanwhile , such a process is dominated by the huge sm backgrounds at the ilc .",
    "so we can conclude that it is not promising to observe the lrth effects through @xmath84 , as a comparison with @xmath1 at the ilc .",
    "the relevant tree - level feynman diagrams of the process @xmath18 in the lrth model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eetth ] . comparing with the sm",
    ", we can see that there are additional diagrams mediated by the heavy gauge boson @xmath85 , the heavy @xmath24-quark and the pseudo - scalar @xmath86 in the lrth model .",
    "although a contribution can also come from the pseudo - scalar @xmath86 , such a contribution is relatively small since the @xmath87 coupling is suppressed by the factor @xmath88 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - tth](a ) , we show the production cross section @xmath68 as functions the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath69 in the lrth model .",
    "we take @xmath70 gev and @xmath89 gev as examples .",
    "since the process proceeds mainly through the @xmath90-channel , we can see that the cross section resonance emerges when @xmath42 approaches the @xmath69 .",
    "for the same scale @xmath34 , the resonance peak for case @xmath55 is smaller than that for case @xmath56 gev .",
    "however , the detection for such resonance effect is beyond the reach of the ilc , this could be accessed later by a multi - tev @xmath7 collider @xcite . in fig . [",
    "fig : cross - tth](b ) , we show the relative correction @xmath77 of the process @xmath18 as functions of the scale @xmath34 for @xmath89 gev at the ilc .",
    "we can see that the deviation is positive for @xmath55 and the deviation is negative for @xmath56 gev .",
    "when the scale @xmath34 ranges from 900 gev to 1500 gev , the values of relative correction is less than 2.4% .    at the ilc , the 10% accuracy expected at @xmath69",
    "= 500 gev can be significantly improved by the data taken at 1000 gev due to the larger cross section and the less background from @xmath91 .",
    "fast simulations at @xmath69 = 800 gev showed that we would be able to determine the top yukawa coupling to 6% for @xmath92 = 120 gev , given an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath81 and residual background uncertainty of 5% @xcite .",
    "full simulations just recently completed by sid and ild showed that the top yukawa coupling could indeed be measured to a statistical precision of 4.3% for @xmath92 = 125 gev with @xmath69 = 1000 gev and the integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath81 @xcite . by this token",
    ", we can see that the @xmath93 production channel will be hard to be observed at the ilc .",
    "in @xmath7 collisions , the main triple higgs boson coupling can be studied through the production channels of double higgs - strahlung off @xmath46 bosons ( @xmath5 , for @xmath69 = 500 gev ) and double higgs fusion ( @xmath6 , for @xmath94 1 tev ) . in the lrth model ,",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eezhh ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : eevvhh ] , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - zhh ] , we show the cross sections of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 as functions of @xmath69 in the sm and the lrth model for the scale @xmath70 gev .",
    "we can see that the cross section for the former process dominates at the low energies , while that for the latter process dominates at high energies , and they have a similar trend in the sm and the lrth model . since the higgs self - coupling in the lrth model is quite different from the sm , the values of cross sections in the lrth model are much larger than the sm .",
    "the recent studies suggest that a precision of 50% for the @xmath95 coupling can be obtained through @xmath96 at the hl - lhc with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath81 @xcite , and may be further improved to be around 13% at the ilc with collision energy up to 1 tev @xcite .",
    "so , the effects of the lrth model on these two processes should be observed at the ilc .",
    "in order to provide more information for probing the lrth model , we also give the effect on the higgs decay .    in the lrth model ,",
    "the major decay modes of the higgs boson are @xmath97(@xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath98 denoting the off - shell charged or neutral electroweak gauge bosons . for @xmath99 decay",
    ", the lrth model can give corrections via the coupling @xmath100 and the heavy top quark loops .",
    "for @xmath101 decay , the @xmath102 quark , @xmath103 boson and @xmath104 boson loops can provide the additional contributions simultaneously .",
    "by contrast , other decay models are less affected by the lrth effect . in our calculations ,",
    "the corresponding expressions of decay widths can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , the relative correction of the decay branching ratio is defined by @xmath105    in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] , we show the relative correction @xmath106 as functions of the scale @xmath34 for @xmath107 gev in the lrth model . we can see that the deviation from the sm prediction for @xmath99 and @xmath101 decay models decrease and finally reduce to the sm results with the increasing @xmath34 . the value of relative correction @xmath106 for @xmath45 150 is larger than @xmath45 0 and the correction @xmath108 can reach @xmath109 .",
    "the expected accuracies at the ilc for the branching ratios of @xmath99 are 4.0% ( 2.9% ) for @xmath69=500 ( 1000 ) gev @xcite , so that the decay mode of @xmath99 might be detected .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the three types of higgs bosons production processes at @xmath7 colliders under the current lhc constraints as follows : ( i ) for the higgs - gauge coupling production , we studied the processes @xmath1 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 . in the allowed parameter space , we found that the processes @xmath1 and @xmath14 might approach the observable threshold of the ilc .",
    "( ii ) for the top quark yukawa coupling production process",
    "@xmath18 , we found that the deviation of the cross section from the sm prediction is lower than @xmath110 in a large part of allowed parameter space so that the effect will be difficult to be observed at the ilc .",
    "( iii ) for the higgs self - coupling production , we studied the processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we found that the cross sections can be enhanced greatly compared to the sm predictions and these effects may be observable at the ilc .",
    "besides , we also investigated the impact of the lrth model on the higgs decay and found that the decay @xmath99 had an obvious deviation from the sm prediction .",

    "<S> in the framework of the left - right twin higgs ( lrth ) model , we consider the constrains from the latest search for high - mass dilepton resonances at the lhc and find that the heavy neutral boson @xmath0 is excluded with mass below 2.76 tev . under these constrains , we study the higgs - gauge coupling production processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , top quark yukawa coupling production process @xmath4 , higgs self - couplings production processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath7 colliders . besides , we study the major decay modes of the higgs boson , namely @xmath8(@xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lrth effects are sizable so that the higgs boson processes at @xmath7 collider can be a sensitive probe for the lrth model . </S>"
