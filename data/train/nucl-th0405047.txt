    "the rise in @xmath62 in the configuration assigned to band 3 at @xmath63 mev ( fig .",

    "this is clearly seen in the relative energies of bands 1 , 2 and 3 in @xmath15kr ( fig .",

    "indeed , by adding one @xmath77 neutron to these configurations of @xmath15kr , four [ 3,3 ] configurations are created ( fig .",
    "[ kr74-a80+stand]a and c ) . in the crmf calculations , these [ 3,3 ] configurations",
    "are somewhat less energetically favored with respect of the [ 2,4 ] configuration used as a reference in comparison with the cns calculations .    since band 4",

    "the polarization effects at the band crossing ( deformation changes , current changes etc . ) are dramatic in the soft @xmath264 nuclei . with this in mind we conclude that no systematic delay of the crossing between the g - band and the doubly aligned s - band as compared to our crhb+ln calculations has been found . previous studies that correlate the delay of the band crossing frequencies with the effects of the @xmath122pairing should be treated with considerable caution . they should be verified in the cranked mean field models which take these polarization effects into account in a more self - consistent way .",
    "let us mention two examples of delayed band crossings in nuclei , where @xmath122pairing is not expected to play a role .",
    "the @xmath265 crossings in the ground state bands of the even - even nd @xmath266 and ce @xmath267 nuclei with @xmath268 ( see ref .",

    "although predicted triaxial softness of heaviest nuclei may be responsible for this delay , no clear supporting evidence for that exists now @xcite .",
    "delays of band crossings were observed also in the ground state bands of some rare - earth nuclei with @xmath275 .",
    "for example , the crossing in the ground state band is delayed in @xmath276hf nuclei as compared with lower mass isotopes @xcite . it was suggested in the framework of the projected shell model that such delays are due to quadrupole pairing @xcite .",
    "however , this is not supported by the crhb+ln calculations which employ the gogny force in pairing channel , and , thus , include all multipole interactions .",
    "for example , these calculations reproduce well the band crossing frequencies in @xmath277hf , but fail to reproduce the delay of the band crossing in @xmath278hf .      due to the pauli principle",
    ", the @xmath16 pair field can not scatter @xmath2 pairs in identical orbitals .",
    "only @xmath3 @xmath2 pairs can be in identical states and be scattered .",
    "therefore , strong mixing of configurations which differ by a change of such @xmath3 @xmath2 pair may be an evidence for @xmath3 pair correlations .",
    "however , it has to be mentioned , that this is not necessarily evidence for the presence of a @xmath3 pair field , because a finite matrix element of the residual interaction can cause a substantial mixing of two configurations with close energies .",
    "this type of configuration mixing has first been discussed for @xmath57kr @xcite . it was speculated that in bands 2 and 3 at intermediate spin the configuration changes from @xmath279 to @xmath280 , which corresponds to a transfer of a neutron - proton pair from the @xmath281 orbital into the @xmath36 orbital .    in @xmath45br and @xmath84kr ,",
    "the [ 2,2 ] and [ 3,3 ] configurations are located very close in energy ( see fig .  14 in ref.@xcite and fig .   [ kr72-eld - a80-stan ] in the present manuscript ) .",
    "if the @xmath3 @xmath2-pairing is present , these configurations are expected to be mixed .",
    "a mixing represents the scattering of a proton and neutron on identical negative parity @xmath41 orbitals into identical @xmath36 orbitals , and vise versa .",
    "such a pair has an isospin @xmath3 , since the proton and neutron are in the same space - spin state .",
    "it was speculated in sect .",
    "vid of ref .",
    "@xcite that the observation of one smooth rotational band hd1 in @xmath45br at high spin instead of the calculated distinct crossing between the [ 2,2 ] and [ 3,3 ] configurations at @xmath282 may point to a such mixing .",
    "more detailed experimental investigation of spectra in @xmath45br in the spin range @xmath283 ( and , in particular , the observation of the bands associated with the [ 2,2 ] configurations ) is needed to clarify the situation in this nucleus .",
    "in particular , a determination of @xmath88 for band hb1 via lifetime measurements could clarify the situation , since the calculated @xmath88 is twice as large for the @xmath73(\\gamma \\sim -20^{\\circ})$ ] configuration as for the [ 2,2 ] configurations ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ br70-defpath ] ) .    in @xmath84kr , the high spin branch of band b",
    "is assigned to the [ 3,3 ] configuration .",
    "band b is the g - band at low spin , which is a superposition of the configurations [ 2,2 ] and [ 4,4 ] .",
    "this means that band b changes from this structure at low spin to [ 3,3 ] at medium / high spin .",
    "this change proceeds in a reasonably smooth way ( fig .",
    "[ kr72-eld - a80-stan ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the peak in the dynamical moment of inertia seen at 0.85 mev ( see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) reflects this change .",
    "the smooth transition from the [ 2,2]+[4,4 ] structure at low spin to [ 3,3 ] at high spin would indicate a scattering of @xmath3 @xmath2 pairs .",
    "however , this explanation implies that there should also be such scattering between bands b and a , which are assigned to [ 3,3 ] and [ 2,2 ] configurations , respectively . the scattering should shift the levels of band a and lead to the modifications of the dynamic moment of inertia at these frequencies , which is , however , smooth in experiment .",
    "also the small distance of the @xmath178 states of bands a and b speaks against a strong interaction between the two bands .",
    "however , for a final judgment one has to carry a three - band ( g , [ 2,2 ] , [ 3,3 ] ) mixing analysis .    the discussed band mixings might be interpreted as related to the scattering of @xmath2 pairs on identical single - particle states in the @xmath41 shell and the @xmath36 shell . however we do not consider this as sufficient evidence for the presence of a @xmath3 pair field .",
    "rather it may indicate weak dynamical @xmath3 pair correlations as suggested by the monte carlo shell model calculations @xcite or just mixing of energetically close configurations by residual interaction .",
    "the rotational bands in even - even @xmath284 nuclei have been studied by means of the cranked nilsson+strutinsky approach , cranked relativistic mean field and cranked relativistic hartree+bogoliubov theories . due to the spontaneous breaking of the isospin symmetry by the isovector pair field , its @xmath2 component needs not to be taken into account explicitly .",
    "it is included implicitly when the isospin symmetry is restored by adding the isorotational energy @xmath285 to the intrinsic energy @xcite .",
    "since @xmath14 states lie at a substantial excitation energy in even - even @xmath0 nuclei , only @xmath13 rotational bands were considered , which means that the isorotational energy shift is irrelevant for the rotational response .",
    "the systematic investigation of the rotating even - even @xmath0 nuclei with @xmath286 leads to the following conclusions .",
    "coexistence of prolate and oblate shapes is found near the ground state . for @xmath287 ,",
    "the yrast states have prolate shape .",
    "their moments of inertia are well reproduced by the calculations that take only the isovector pair field into account . at high spin , the isovector pairing is very weak and calculations with zero pairing agree well with the results of treating the isovector pairing in the framework of the lipkin - nogami approximation .",
    "all these calculations account well for the data .",
    "this concerns the moments of inertia as well as the relative energies of different configurations .",
    "the level of agreement between theory and experiment is comparable , sometimes even better than for the nuclei away from the @xmath0 line .",
    "the available experimental high - spin data do not require the introduction of the @xmath3 @xmath2-pairing into the models , and , thus , do not provide any evidence of this type of pairing .",
    "the delay of the crossing between the ground band and the doubly aligned s - band in even - even @xmath0 nuclei has been suggested as an evidence for the @xmath3 @xcite @xmath2 pair field .",
    "the new data do not show such a delay in @xmath84kr , which was considered as the most important evidence .",
    "such delay is also absent in @xmath83se @xcite .",
