    "in recent years , the study of @xmath0 reactions has been one of the most useful tools to probe correlations in nuclei .",
    "absolute spectroscopic factors have become available for many closed - shell nuclei  @xcite demonstrating that the removal probability for nucleons from these systems is reduced by about 35% in comparison with the simple shell model .",
    "the theoretical description of this reduction requires the inclusion of both short - range and long - range correlations . for nuclear matter a strength removal of about 15% is obtained by including short - range correlations  @xcite . for @xmath1",
    "the inclusion of short - range correlations leads to removal of single - particle ( sp ) strength of the order of 10%  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of long - range correlations for heavier nuclei like @xmath2 yields a qualitative description of the sp strength distribution by including in the nucleon self - energy the coupling to either low - lying collective particle - hole ( ph ) or particle - particle ( pp ) phonons calculated in random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite .",
    "the additional depletion of about 10% due to short - range correlations for this nucleus leads to a reasonable quantitative agreement for the largest fragments of the experimental strength distribution .",
    "theoretical calculations of hole spectroscopic factors for @xmath3 are not so successful .",
    "the experimental spectroscopic strength  @xcite for the knockout of a proton from both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 shells corresponds to about @xmath6 .",
    "the 10% reduction due to short - range correlations is mostly compensated by the proper inclusion of the center - of - mass motion which enhances the probability for @xmath7 removal by about 7%  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the green s function approach , including both long- and short - range correlations , yield about a @xmath8 reduction  @xcite .",
    "these results still need to be corrected for the center - of - mass effect .",
    "it is therefore fair to conclude that the present theoretical results for @xmath1 are still about 20% away from the experimental data .",
    "the importance of low - energy correlations is clearly demonstrated by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and their proper inclusion is therefore crucial for a complete understanding of this puzzle . in the latter work",
    "the self - energy was obtained including the effects of interactions between both pp and ph excitations in the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) . in order to account for the coupling to collective excitations that are actually observed in @xmath1",
    "it is necessary to at least consider an rpa description of the isoscalar negative parity states  @xcite . to account for the low - lying isoscalar positive parity states",
    "an even more complicated treatment will be required .",
    "sizable collective effects are also present in the pp and hole - hole ( hh ) excitations involving tensor correlations for isoscalar and pair correlations for isovector states .",
    "another argument to improve the description of the coupling of sp states to low - lying collective excitations is provided by the lack of fragmentation at low energy obtained in present theoretical studies  @xcite in disagreement with experimental data .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to account for the collectivity in the ph and pp ( hh ) channels in a consistent way while including these excitations at least at the rpa level .",
    "since the observed fragmentation and depletion of the sp strength in @xmath1 is quite substantial , it is reasonable to assume that these features are also important in the description of the excitations that contribute to the self - energy .",
    "this results in a self - consistent formulation where the dressing of the nucleons is incorporated in the description of the collective excitations that ultimately leads to the dressing itself . for this reason",
    "the present work will be formulated using self - consistent green s functions ( scgf ) .",
    "this type of self - consistency must also be considered in describing pairing correlations in semi - magic nuclei  @xcite .    a formalism in which both pp and ph phonons",
    "are treated at the rpa level in the self - energy was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this work focused on the two - time two - particle one - hole ( 2p1h ) propagator and generated a formulation that reduces to either including the pp - rpa or the ph - rpa phonons in the self - energy when ph or pp vertices are omitted , respectively .",
    "this expansion , however , was obtained using some drastic assumptions and disregarding some of the constraints that arise when propagators in different diagrams of the expansion are connected .",
    "related to this issue is the appearance of unphysical solutions for the 2p1h propagator that have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "results in  @xcite have therefore been obtained mostly for the tda treatment of the 2p1h propagator . moreover , this approximation was obtained by employing mean - field ( single - pole ) sp propagators . in the present self - consistent treatment , which sums fully dressed propagators , this approach is no longer possible .    to proceed with the inclusion of both pp and ph collectivity in the nucleon self - energy",
    "it is important to note that the naive summation of diagrams containing both pp and ph phonons leads to serious inconsistencies .",
    "this approximation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_ph_sf ] .",
    "the last of the three diagrams on the right hand side is already contained in each of the other two and must therefore be subtracted to avoid double counting .",
    "this subtraction introduces spurious poles in the lehmann representation of the self - energy and generates meaningless solutions of the dyson equation . the minus sign in front this term may also prevent in some cases the proper normalization of the spectroscopic amplitudes .",
    "this feature can be understood by considering a possible solution near such a spurious pole .",
    "the normalization is determined by the derivative of the self - energy at this energy  @xcite and will not yield a correct result on account of the additional minus sign when the third diagram dominates .",
    "in addition , each of the first two terms in fig .  [",
    "fig : pp_ph_sf ] ignores the pauli correlations between the freely propagating line and the quasi - particles forming the phonons , as noted in  @xcite . in the present work a formalism",
    "is pursued which sums the contribution of the pp and ph phonons to the self - energy to all orders avoiding the subtraction of the second order diagram .",
    "the treatment of pauli correlations is improved over methods that employ ph rpa phonons in the self - energy since all exchange terms at the 2p1h level are consistently included .",
    "other approaches have been proposed in the literature that attempt to extend the nature of the phonon correlations included by performing massive summations of diagrams  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a consistent resummation of both pp and ph phonons to all orders has not been achieved in these papers . the main problem in pursuing such an infinite summation of diagrams for the 2p1h propagator , which includes both pp and ph rpa correlations ,",
    "is related to the fact that a two - body interaction can invert the sense of propagation of only two lines ( i.e. change at most two holes in two particles and vice versa ) while the third line continues to propagate in the original direction . in this way",
    ", a propagator depending on more than two times is generated .",
    "it is therefore necessary first to consider an exact formulation involving the four - time green s function for the 2p1h propagator .",
    "direct application of four - time propagator equations presumably will remain impractical for the forseeable future .",
    "appropriate approximations to this equation are therefore necessary to construct the relevant two - times green s functions which contains the sought after correlations .",
    "the scheme studied in this paper consists in computing the rpa phonons in the pp and ph channels , separately , and then summing them to all orders employing a faddeev technique  @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial problem in the implementation of the faddeev equations is the appearance of spurious solutions  @xcite which also have to be considered for the 2p1h propagator .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the spurious eigenstates are easy to recognize for the few - body problem since they also diagonalize the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "their main features are that their eigenvalues are known and that their wave - function amplitudes sum up to zero .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the many - body problem when the faddeev technique is employed . in particular ,",
    "the fulfillment of closure relations for pp and ph amplitudes is related to the behavior of the spurious faddeev eigenstates . without a consistent treatment of this relation",
    "the spurious solutions will mix with the physically meaningful ones . applying the faddeev technique to the many - body problem ,",
    "it is important to solve for all physical solutions that contribute to the self - energy .",
    "thus , it is necessary to develop a formalism in which the spurious solutions are correctly separated from the physical ones .",
    "the practical implementation of the present faddeev scheme is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the resulting set of equations require a great deal of computational effort , especially when dressed propagators are employed .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that they can be solved in practice and results using this formalism will be presented elsewhere .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rand4timesfd ] we briefly describe the scgf approach based on the dyson equation and present the exact faddeev formalism for the four - times 2p1h propagator .",
    "the construction of a consistent formulation for the two - time 2p1h propagator including the propagation of the pp and ph rpa phonons to all orders is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : faddeev ] .",
    "although sofar only the 2p1h propagator has been mentioned , it should be understood that the corresponding two - hole one - particle ( 2h1p ) propagator must be included in the calculation of the nucleon self - energy . in the present work no coupling terms",
    "are considered that transform the 2p1h into the 2h1p propagators ( or vice versa ) .",
    "for this reason the same technique can be used for both propagators and we will use the generic 2p1h to represent both . in sec .",

    "the propagator @xmath31 can be obtained as the sum of an infinite set of diagrams , built from interaction vertices and unperturbed sp propagators @xmath32 corresponding to @xmath15",
    ". in the nuclear case , a strong coupling exists between the sp degree of freedom and both collective low - lying states as well as high - lying states .",
    "the latter coupling is related to the strong short - range repulsion in the nuclear force .",
    "the resulting fragmentation of the sp strength , as observed in experimental data , suggests that this feature must already be included in the description of these couplings .",
    "for this reason self - consistent one - body propagators need to be considered in the construction of the nucleon self - energy .",
    "this self - consistency feature also emerges in an exact formulation , involving the coupling to two- , three- and @xmath9-body propagators , which can be derived using the equation of motion method  @xcite . in short",
    ", this means that for the nuclear case one needs to develop the perturbation theory in terms of the dressed propagator  ( [ eq : fullg_time ] ) approximated in an appropriate way .",
    "the approach we use here consists in computing @xmath31 as a solution of the dyson equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the irreducible self - energy . here and",

    "<S> the scope of the few - body faddeev equations is extended to describe the motion of two - hole one - particle ( two - particle one - hole ) excitations . this formalism allows to sum both particle - particle and particle - hole phonons , obtained separately in the random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of spurious solutions for the present application of the faddeev method is related to the inclusion of a consistent set of diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism presented here appears practical for finite nuclei and achieves a simultaneous inclusion of particle - particle and particle - hole phonons to all orders while the spurious solutions are properly eliminated . </S>"
