    "the discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictides@xcite has attracted world - wide interests in searching for new type of high @xmath7 superconductors and unveiling their unconventional nature of superconductivity . until now , several",
    "series of iron - based superconductors have been found @xcite , which posses a similar layered crystal structure to those of the high @xmath7 cuprates . resembling the cuprates and heavy fermions , superconductivity in most of the iron pnictides / chalcogenides seems to be closely tied up with magnetism @xcite ; superconductivity appears while antiferromagnetism is suppressed by hole ( or electron ) doping or by application of external pressure . in particular , the layered crystal structure and",
    "the high superconducting transition temperatures of the iron pnictides / chalcogenides initially suggested a strong analogy with the cuprates , providing an alternative to study the puzzles of high @xmath7 superconductivity .",
    "however , significant discrepancies have been observed between the iron - based superconductors and other layered superconductors .",
    "for example , d - wave superconductivity was realized in the high @xmath7 cuprates , but an @xmath8-type order parameter has been proposed for the iron pnictides / chalcogenides superconductors @xcite .",
    "upper critical field is another important superconducting parameter .",
    "a large upper critical field has been identified in both iron pnictides / chalcogenides and the cuprates , but the former shows a rather weak effect of anisotropy @xcite . in particular , nearly isotropic upper critical field @xmath0 has been observed in the 122- and 11-type iron pnictides / chalcogenides @xcite , remarkably different from any other layered superconductors .",
    "lifeas , a much cleaner compound with a large ratio of room temperature resistivity to residual resistivity ( rrr@xmath9 40 ) , seems to be very unique among the iron pnictide superconductors @xcite .",
    "bearing a nearly identical structure of ( fe@xmath10as@xmath10)@xmath11 and also a similar electronic structure to other iron pnictides @xcite , lifeas , however , shows simple metallic behavior prior to entering the superconducting state , lacking evidence of structural / magnetic transitions .",
    "moreover , the stoichiometric compound lifeas becomes superconducting at ambient pressure and without introducing additional charge carriers via doping .",
    "nevertheless , lifeas still demonstrates a relatively high @xmath7 ( @xmath12 k ) , being comparable with those iron pnictides / chalcogenides which parent compounds undergo a magnetic / structural transition .",
    "unfortunately , lifeas is extremely air sensitive and many of its superconducting properties remain mysterious because of the restrictions of accessible experimental methods . in lifeas the extrapolation of @xmath13 near @xmath7 to zero temperature gives a rather large value of @xmath14 t ) @xcite . in order to fully track the field dependence of superconductivity , a strong magnetic field",
    "is desired . here",
    "we report the first resistivity measurement of lifeas in a pulsed magnetic field down to 1.4k , from which the temperature - magnetic field phase diagram is well established .",
    "the upper critical field @xmath13 is determined to be 15 t and 24.2 t at @xmath15k for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . in comparison with other series of iron pnictide superconductors",
    ", the upper critical field shows a moderate anisotropic effect and its value of @xmath16 is largely reduced .",
    "high - quality single crystals of lifeas have been grown by a self - flux technique @xcite .",
    "the precursor of li@xmath17as was synthesized from li piece and as chips that were sealed in a nb tube under ar atmosphere and then treated at 650@xmath18c for 15 hours in a sealed quartz tube . the li@xmath17as , fe and as powders were mixed in the ratio of li : fe : as=1:0.8:1 .",
    "the powder mixture was then pressed into a pallet in an alumina oxide tube . to prevent the vaporized li from attacking the quartz tube at high temperature ,",
    "the sample pallet was subsequently sealed in a nb tube and a quartz tube under vacuum .",
    "the sealed quartz tube was heated at 800@xmath18c for 10h before heating up to 1100 @xmath18c at which it was hold for another 10h . finally , it was cooled down to 800@xmath18c with a rate of 5@xmath18c per hour . crystals with a size up to 4mm@xmath193mm@xmath190.5 mm were obtained .",
    "the whole preparation work were carried out in a glove box protected with high purity ar gas .",
    "the obtained single crystals were first characterized by x - ray diffraction with a mac science diffractometer and ac susceptibility measurements using the oxford cryogenic system ( maglab - exa-12 ) prior to the transport measurements in a pulsed magnetic field at los alamos .     for lifeas at zero field .",
    "the lower inset shows the magnetic susceptibility @xmath20.,width=302 ]    electrical resistivity was measured using a typical four - contact method in pulsed fields of up to 40 t and at temperatures down to 1.4k in a helium-4 cryostat .",

    "2 mm @xmath190.5mm@xmath190.1 mm were cleaved off along the c - direction from the as - grown samples . in order to avoid oxidizing the samples ,",
    "special cares were paid to protect the samples from exposing to air while preparing for the electrical contacts .",
    "data were recorded using a 10  mhz digitizer and 100  khz alternating current , and analyzed using a custom low - noise digital lock - in technique .",

    "note that the weak kink in the resistivity @xmath22 around 75k is attributed to the change of cooling rate .",
    "no evidence of structural / magnetic transition has been observed in lifeas . in order to demonstrate the superconducting transition in detail , we plot the low temperature electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility in the inset of fig.1 , which were measured with samples cut from the same batch .",
    "as frequently observed in superconductors , the bulk @xmath7 determined from the magnetic susceptibility is slightly lower .",
    "the observations of a large rrr ( @xmath24 ) and a narrow superconducting transition indicate high quality of the samples investigated here . since lifeas is a good metal with low resistivity , measurements of its electrical resistivity in a pulsed magnetic field is rather challenging .",

    "2 shows the field dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath25 of lifeas at variant temperatures , in which the magnetic field is applied along ( a ) the c - axis and ( b ) the ab - plane , respectively .",
    "one can see that a relatively sharp superconducting transition survives down to very low temperatures , even though the signals become more noisy upon cooling down , in particular for the case of @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , the superconducting transition is eventually suppressed upon applying a magnetic field , but the critical field required to suppress superconductivity is much larger for @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the normal state of lifeas remains metallic upon suppressing superconductivity in a sufficiently high magnetic field , being different from those of the 122- and 11-type compounds@xcite .     and",

    "such a value of @xmath1 is slightly higher than that of the 122- and 11-type compound @xcite , which shows nearly isotropic behavior at low temperatures , but significantly smaller compared to that of the high @xmath7 cuprates and organic superconductors @xcite . according to the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg method @xcite , the upper critical field limited by the orbital mechanisms in the dirty limit",
