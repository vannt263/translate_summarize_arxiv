    "this fact is the motivation for the current investigation and in the following we explain this twofold meaning in detail .    in particular ,",
    "let us consider two sharp observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a qubit system .",
    "these can be , for instance , spin component measurements on a spin-@xmath2 system .",
    "the observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are described by the selfadjoint operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the pauli matrices and @xmath6 are unit vectors . alternatively , and for our purposes more conveniently , these observables can be described by _",
    "projection valued measures _ ( pvms ) .",
    "then @xmath0 and @xmath1 are identified as mappings from a set of measurement outcomes to projectors @xmath7 a measurement of @xmath0 ( similarly @xmath1 ) gives either a result up ( + 1 ) or down ( -1 ) ; see fig .",

    "this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath15}={\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ ] for every @xmath16 .",
    "hence , certain predictability of one outcome of @xmath0 implies that both outcomes of @xmath1 are equally likely , and vice versa .",
    "this relation is usually referred to as _ ( value ) complementarity _ @xcite .",
    "our assumption on the orthogonality of @xmath13 and @xmath14 means , in particular , that the observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not commute , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "the noncommutativity implies the impossibility of performing their joint measurement .",
    "therefore , we need to choose whether we measure @xmath0 or @xmath1 , their simultaneous measurement being impossible .",
    "it is possible to approximate @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a pair of jointly measurable observables @xmath18 and @xmath19 described by _ positive operator valued measures _ ( povms ) @xcite .",
    "an essential fact is that for povms ( unlike for pvms ) commutativity is not a necessary condition for joint measurability .",
    "suppose we want to approximate @xmath0 and @xmath1 equally well .",
    "then a class of approximating observables , parametrized by a number @xmath20 , is defined by @xmath21 the number @xmath22 quantifies how close @xmath18 and @xmath19 are to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .    in the limiting case @xmath23",
    "we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 , however , in such case @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not jointly measurable .",

    "however , in @xcite it has been proved that any modification to @xmath18 and @xmath19 leads either to a worse approximation or lack of joint measurability .",
    "a joint observable for the observables @xmath18 and @xmath19 is defined as a povm @xmath30 with four outcomes corresponding to four possible pairs of @xmath18 and @xmath19 outcomes , @xmath31 .",

    "\\label{eq : g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to verify that @xmath30 indeed fulfills the requirements and that each @xmath34 is a positive operator .",
    "various ways to realize @xmath30 and other related measurements have been discussed ( e.g. ,  in @xcite ) .",
    "so far , our discussion has concerned only joint measurability of observables ( i.e. , compatibility of measurement outcome probabilities ) .",
    "there is also another level of compatibility , arising from the fact that a ( nontrivial ) quantum measurement necessarily affects the state of the measured system .",
    "thus , each measurement outcome has an associated operation , which is mathematically described as a completely positive trace - nonincreasing mapping on the set of states .",
    "the collection of all these operations forms an _ instrument _ @xcite .",
    "the standard measurement for a discrete sharp observable is the so - called _ von neumann measurement_. the corresponding instrument , which we call the von neumann instrument , has a very simple form . in our case ,",
    "the von neumann instruments @xmath35 and @xmath36 associated with the sharp observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , are given by    [ eq : vn ] @xmath37    for instance , if the system is in a state @xmath8 and a measurement of @xmath0 gives the outcome @xmath9 , then the unnormalized output state is @xmath38 ; see fig .",

    "therefore , if we want to realize the instruments @xmath35 and @xmath36 in a single measurement scheme , we need to approximate them .    in the case of the approximating observables @xmath28",
    "the von neumann instruments are commonly replaced by _",
    "lders instruments _ @xmath41 and @xmath42 , defined as    [ eq : luders ] @xmath43    for the operator @xmath44 , the square root @xmath45 takes the form , @xmath46 hence , we see that @xmath47 in this way , we can understand the @xmath41 measurement as an approximate version of the @xmath35 measurement .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a convenient summary of the lders instrument in general . in the limiting case @xmath23 when @xmath24 and @xmath25 the formulas and coincide .",
    "hence , we would expect that the lders instruments of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are good approximations to the von neumann instruments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here , however , we face a problem . it was shown in @xcite that two lders operations @xmath48 and @xmath49 are jointly measurable if and only if stands for the operator @xmath50 being positive . ]",
    "either @xmath51 or @xmath52 for some @xmath53 .",
    "since neither of these two conditions holds in our situation , we find that the lders instruments @xmath41 and @xmath42 can not be realized in a single experimental setup .",
    "therefore , they do not provide the jointly measurable approximations that we are looking for .",
    "we conclude that the obvious replacements for the von neumann instruments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , namely the lders instruments of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are not jointly measurable , although the observables @xmath18 and @xmath19 are .",
    "on the other hand , joint measurability of @xmath18 and @xmath19 implies that they have _ some _ jointly measurable instruments .",
    "in fact , every instrument implementing a joint observable of @xmath18 and @xmath19 gives instruments for @xmath18 and @xmath19 as its marginals .",
    "in the following we will characterize the joint instrument which gives the best approximations for the von neumann instruments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we derive some useful properties of the joint observable @xmath30 , defined in .",
    "let us first make a general observation .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 and @xmath19 would have a second joint observable @xmath54 .",
    "then , also all the convex combinations @xmath55 , @xmath56 , defined as ( @xmath16 ) @xmath57(i , j ) = \\lambda { \\mathsf{g}}(i , j ) + ( 1-\\lambda ) { \\mathsf{g}}'(i , j ) \\",

    "this leads to the conclusion that @xmath18 and @xmath19 either have a unique joint observable or uncountably many different joint observables .",

    "this is essential for our investigation as it crucially limits the search for optimal joint instruments .    visual representation of the four - ball intersection determining the existence of joint observable for @xmath18 and @xmath19 parametrized by @xmath58 and vector @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath60 , all four balls intersect in a single point ( white circle ) defining the joint observable ( solid arcs ) .",
    "if @xmath58 differs from @xmath61 ( e.g.  @xmath62 as in the figure ) , two opposite circles intersect , while the other two do not ; in such a case there is no joint observable with given @xmath58 ( dot - dashed arcs ) . ]    to see that @xmath30 is a unique joint observable for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we first notice that any joint observable @xmath54 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 is completely determined by a single operator , say @xmath63 .",
    "the other operators are then recovered from the marginal conditions .",
    "since @xmath63 is a positive operator , we can write it as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 . as noticed in @xcite ,",
    "the conditions for @xmath63 to define a joint observable for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the following operator inequalities : @xmath67 these are equivalent to the requirement that the vector @xmath59 is in the intersection of four balls : @xmath68 since @xmath13 and @xmath14 are orthogonal unit vectors , the intersection is nonempty only if @xmath69 , and in that case @xmath70 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:2-uniqueness ] .",

    "we first observe that @xmath86 is a one - dimensional projection .",

    "an observable defined as @xmath194\\ ] ] is a joint observable for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath193 since it satisfies the marginal conditions , @xmath195 unlike in the earlier situation , now we have several different joint observables . another joint observable @xmath196 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath193",
    "is given by @xmath197    a notable feature of the observable @xmath196 is that it is essentially a four - outcome observable .",
    "although @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath193 have infinitely many different joint observables , @xmath196 is the unique joint observable having only four nonzero elements . to demonstrate this fact ,",
    "suppose that @xmath198 is a joint observable of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath193 , and that @xmath199 first of all , let us notice that @xmath198 is completely determined by a single nonzero element , say @xmath200 .",
    "the other operators are given by the marginal conditions .",
    "for instance , @xmath201 .",
    "since @xmath198 is an observable , the operators @xmath202 must sum up to identity .",
    "hence , we get @xmath203+[{\\mathsf{b}}(1)-{\\mathsf{f}}'(1,1,1)]\\\\ & & + [ { \\mathsf{c}}(1)-{\\mathsf{f}}'(1,1,1 ) ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the operator @xmath200 is determined by the equation , @xmath204 \\ , .\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath205 , and the four - outcome joint observable is hence unique .",
    "as done previously for the joint observable @xmath30 , we can now study the instruments implementing @xmath192 and @xmath196 .",
    "the elements forming @xmath192 and @xmath196 are rank-1 operators .",
    "therefore , our characterization for instruments implementing @xmath30 in sec .",
    "[ sec : joint - instrument ] applies to these two observables as well .",
    "an instrument implementing @xmath192 is determined by eight states @xmath206 and the corresponding operations are @xmath207}\\zeta_{\\pm\\pm\\pm}\\ ] ] the approximations to von neumann instruments @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath208 are now defined as follows : @xmath209 the optimal instrument under the average distance can be deduced by following a similar procedure as the one presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : avgoptimal ] .",
    "we thus determine the minimum of the sum @xmath210 where now , for instance , the distance @xmath134 is @xmath211 and @xmath212\\ , .\\ ] ] using the criterion , it is straightforward to verify that the optimal solution is achieved when @xmath213 .",
    "all the distances are then equal and take the value @xmath214 .",
    "the related joint instrument is the lders instrument @xmath215 of @xmath192 .",
    "an instrument @xmath216 implementing @xmath196 is , again , determined by eight states .",
    "however , the states corresponding to the zero elements play no role , so @xmath216 is actually determined by four states only . since @xmath196 gives different measurement outcome probabilities than @xmath192 , the related average distances are also different .",
    "so , if we consider @xmath196 , we get @xmath217 and @xmath218 the sum @xmath219 achieves its minimum when the four relevant bloch vectors are @xmath220 this choice gives @xmath221 .",
    "the related joint instrument is the lders instrument @xmath222 of @xmath196 .",
    "bloch vector comparison of the four- and eight - outcome instruments .",
    "the four - outcome instrument leads to normalized output states from the edges of the tetrahedron ( especially for the measurement along the @xmath223 axis illustrated by the thick red diagonal ) .",
    "the eight - outcome instrument leads to the faces of the cube given by the vectors @xmath224 ( especially for the measurement along the @xmath223 axis illustrated by the blue circle ) . ]",
    "we can , again , use bloch representation and write the normalized output states similarly as in .",
    "for the four - outcome instrument we get a similar result  the normalized output states are convex combinations of the corresponding states defining the instrument .",
    "for instance , the normalized output state , when measuring along axis @xmath223 and obtaining the outcome @xmath225 , is a convex combination of @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "hence , these bloch vectors of output states lie on the edges of a tetrahedron as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] ( thick red line ) .",
    "for the eight - outcome instrument we find that the corresponding output states form a set @xmath228 this set is a circle lying in the plane given by the vectors @xmath229 , @xmath230 [ i.e. ,  being inscribed into the face of the cube such as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] ( blue circle ) ] . from this geometrical representation",
    "we can confirm the fact shown earlier ; under the usage of the average distance the four - outcome instrument is worse that the eight - outcome instrument as it has a contribution from states being further from the reference state .",
    "the impossibility of joint measurements of orthogonal qubit measurements leads us to the study of their approximations .",
    "we have considered not only observables , but we have accessed the problem from the perspective of instruments . we have characterized the optimal approximation of two von neumann instruments , and the optimal joint instrument was found to be the lders instrument of the optimal ( unique ) joint observable .",
    "this result [ see eq .  ] was achieved by searching for the best approximation under the average distance between the normalized output states . when considering the worst case norm ,",
    "the resulting optimal instrument is a mixture of the corresponding lders instrument and the state - space contraction into the complete mixture [ see eq .  ] .",
    "a similar investigation was performed in the case of three von neumann instruments , but then we faced the problem of non - uniqueness of the optimal joint observable .",
    "nevertheless , in the two commonly used instances the lders instrument was found to be optimal .",
    "although the numerical value of the minimal average distance does not have any intrinsic meaning , one can use it in order to compare the minimal distances in the three studied cases : approximation of two von neumann instruments and approximations of three von neumann instruments with eight- and four - outcome measurements .",
    "the minimal average distances for these approximations are @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 , respectively .",
    "as one would expect , the average distance can be made lowest in the first case .",
    "namely , it is certainly easier to approximate two von neumann instruments rather than three .",
    "furthermore , it is not surprising that in the latter two cases eight instead of four outcomes are more efficient in the approximation task .",
    "this may be explained by a broader set of outcomes to choose from , leaving less space for error .",
    "we believe that lders instruments are optimal joint instruments for a more general class of situations than only those studied here .",
    "a natural extension of the two orthogonal qubit observables would be the case of two sharp observables related to mutually unbiased bases .",
    "another interesting class is that of the continuous variable systems , where phase space observables play the role of joint observables . these generalizations merit further study .",
