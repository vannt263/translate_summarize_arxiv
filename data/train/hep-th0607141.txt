    "the recursion relation method was introduced to study the multi - particle processes in the  jets \" which are produced in hadron - colliders .",
    "the underlying observation that makes this method practical , first made in @xcite and then proved for general case @xcite , is that the result of perturbative calculation of a gauge theory can be expressed in an unexpectedly simple and compact form . in the earlier version of the method ,",
    "the recursion relations are derived for the multi - gluon current , the so - called gluonic recursion relations @xcite . for the qcd case , as a non - abelian gauge theory , this machinery has been developed to give the helicity amplitudes for the processes involving arbitrary number of gluons with special helicity configurations @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "also , apart from practical point of view , the recursion relations are used to prove certain properties of amplitudes @xcite .",
    "recently this technique has been developed to systematic calculation of amplitudes based on the so - called mhv - rules introduced in @xcite , together with the new recursion relations now among amplitudes @xcite , in which amplitudes are constructed from a new set of building blocks - maximum helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes - which themselves represent groups of feynman diagrams corresponding to particular external helicity configurations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the last years a great interest has been appeared to study field theories on spaces whose coordinates do not commute .",
    "these spaces , as well as the field theories defined on them , are known under the names of noncommutative spaces and theories @xcite ; see @xcite as review .",
    "in contrast to u(1 ) gauge theory on ordinary space - time , as we briefly review in next section , noncommutative version of theory is involved by direct interactions between photons .",
    "interestingly one finds the situation very reminiscent to that of non - abelian gauge theories , and then the question is whether the techniques developed for non - abelian theory purposes can be used for noncommutative qed case too . in particular , the same question may arise for the recursive relation techniques . in this contribution",
    "we present the recursion relations for photons of noncommutative qed in the sense of @xcite .",
    "this is in fact the first step to employ the recursion relations method for noncommutative qed case .",
    "the recursion method , both in the form of its earlier version @xcite and recent one @xcite , has been already considered for the case of ordinary qed . as we will see the general structure of these relations for noncommutative qed is similar to qcd s one , though due to appearance of momentum - dependent factors in vertex functions , instead of momentum - independent color ones of qcd , a special treatment is needed to manage and reexamine the whole machinery in this case .",
    "the organization of the rest of this work is as follows . in sec  2",
    "we briefly review some facts about noncommutative spaces and theories . in sec  3",
    "we derive the current recursion relations for pure photonic processes with arbitrary number of photons at tree level . in sec  4",
    "we present the recursion relations for the processes in the presence of one pair of fermions , and arbitrary number of photons at tree level .",
    "sec  5 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "noncommutative spacetime coordinates satisfy the commutation relation = i^ where @xmath0 is a constant real antisymmetric matrix that parameterizes the noncommutativity of the spacetime .",
    "it is understood that field theories on noncommutative spacetime are defined by actions that are essentially the same as in ordinary spacetime , with the exception that the products between fields are replaced by @xmath1-product , defined for two functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite f(x)g(x)&=&f(x)e^_^_g(x ) + & = & f(x)g(x)+_n=1^()^n ^_1_1^_n_n _ _ 1__nf(x)__1__ng(x ) + & & though @xmath1-product itself is not commutative ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 ) the following identities make some of calculations easier : &  & fg^nx = gf^nx = fg^nx + &  & fgh^nx = f ( gh)^nx=(fg ) h^nx + &  & fgh^nx = hfg ^nx = ghf^nxby the first two ones we see that , in integrands always one of the stars can be removed .",
    "besides it can be seen that the @xmath1-product is associative , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 , and so it is not important which two should be multiplied firstly .",
    "the pure gauge field sector of noncommutative u(1 ) theory is defined by the action s_gauge - field=-^4x f_f^=-^4x f_f^ in which the field strength @xmath6 is [ field ] f_=_a_(x)-_a_(x)-ie[a_(x),a_(x ) ] _ by definition @xmath7_{\\star}=f\\star g - g\\star f$ ] .",
    "we mention @xmath8_{\\star}=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] .",
    "the action above is invariant under local gauge symmetry transformations [ trans ] a_(x)= ua_(x)u^-1+u_u^-1 in which @xmath9 is the @xmath1-phase , defined by a function @xmath10 via the @xmath1-exponential : [ starphase ] &  & u(x)=_(i)=1+i-+ , + &  & uu^-1=u^-1u=1 in which @xmath11 . under above transformation ,",
    "the field strength transforms as f _ & & f^_=uf_u^-1 we mention that the transformations of gauge field as well as the field strength look like those of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "besides we see that the action contains terms which are responsible for interaction between the gauge particles , again as the situation we have in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "we see how the noncommutativity of coordinates induces properties on fields and their transformations , as if they were belong to a non - abelian theory ; the subject that how the characters of coordinates and fields may be related to each other is discussed in @xcite .      here",
    "we present the feynman rules in the pure gauge theory sector of noncommutative qed . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the spatial noncommutativity , that is assuming @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "we have 3- and 4-vertex functions , given by ( see fig  [ feyrule ] ) @xcite : ^_1_2_3(k_1,k_2,k_3)&= & -2e(12 ) [ ( k_1-k_2)^_3g^_1_2 + ( k_2-k_3)^_1g^_2_3 + & & + ( k_3-k_1)^_2g^_3_1 ] [ feynman1 ] with @xmath15 , and ^_1_2_3_4(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4)&=&-4ie^2[feynman3 ] with @xmath16 , and the replacement @xmath17 .",
    "note that in writing the rules we used the convention that all photons momenta are out - going , although one can easily check the following : k_4 -k_4 & & ^1,2,3,4__1_2_3_4-^1,2,3,4__1_2_3_4 and @xmath18 becomes @xmath19 .",
    "as one easily recognizes , the above vertex functions are very similar to those by non - abelian gauge theories , with this exception that the color factors of non - abelian theories here are replaced by @xmath20 s factors , which are momentum dependent .",
    "the photon - fermion vertex function with @xmath21 for photon s momentum and @xmath22 and @xmath23 for outgoing and incoming fermion s momenta respectively , in noncommutative qed is given by ( see fig  [ feyrule ] ) @xcite ^(k , q , q)=ie^=ie^",
    "as noted , noncommutative qed is involved by self - interaction of photons , making it in this respect very similar to a non - abelian gauge theory . here",
    "we present the photon recursion relations for noncommutative qed . as we will show",
    "the general structure of these relations is similar to qcd s one , though due to appearance of momentum - dependent factors in vertex functions , instead of color ones in qcd case , a special treatment is needed to manage and reexamine the whole machinery in this case . in this section",
    "we shall consider the tree - level diagrams involved solely by photons .",
    "consider the matrix element for the diagram with @xmath24 outgoing photons , in the case that one of them is off - shell .",
    "this quantity , like its counterpart in qcd case , will be called an @xmath25-photon current and is denoted by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the vector index of the off - shell photon .",
    "the @xmath28-particle amplitude can be obtained from @xmath26 by a suitable contraction with a polarization vector of the last photon , the @xmath29th  one .",
    "first let us introduce some parts of the notation hereafter are in use .",
    "following the case for qcd , we also define the un - hatted @xmath30 , which essentially defined for the same quantity as @xmath26 , apart from the @xmath20 and @xmath31 factors ; in the qcd case the difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is coming from the color factors @xcite . hence the helicity s content of current is included only in @xmath30 .",
    "we define the sum of momenta @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "also , we use the replacement @xmath36 .",
    "we start with the cases with one , two and three photons . for one photon",
    "we simply define _ ( 1)=_=j_(1 ) where @xmath37 is the polarization vector of the photon , depending on the helicity and momentum @xmath38 of the particle .",
