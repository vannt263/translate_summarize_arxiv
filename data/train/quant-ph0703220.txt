    "the coherent control of an @xmath0-level quantum system is of interest in fields such as chemical dynamics @xcite , quantum information processing  @xcite , and quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that for an @xmath0-level system to be completely controllable , it is sufficient that the free - evolution hamiltonian , along with the interaction hamiltonian ( which could involve a sequence of steps ) and all possible commutators among them , form a lie algebra of dimension @xmath10 , which in general is taken to be @xmath11 . recently , it has been shown  @xcite that state - to - state controllability can be achieved with a lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath1 with dimension @xmath2 .",
    "( we use the notation @xmath12 for the algebra of the group @xmath13 of @xmath14 unitary symplectic matrices , as for example in the text by jones @xcite .",
    "other authors denote the same group by @xmath15 @xcite or @xmath16 @xcite . ) in this paper , we show by calculating the cartan subalgebra that this reduction places a restriction on the types of systems that can be state - to - state controlled .",
    "specifically , not only do the systems have to have an even number of energy levels  @xcite , their field - free energy levels must be symmetrically distributed about an average .",
    "an example of such a system is a multi - qubit system that has @xmath17 energy levels .",
    "this result in quantum control is important both for developing optimal control schemes in quantum computing @xcite and for finding algorithms to calculate applied fields for quantum - state engineering @xcite .",
    "the control equations can be derived from the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath18 where the state vectors @xmath19 , give the amplitudes in a basis of free - evolution eigenstates , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constant matrices , and the real scalar functions @xmath22 are the control fields .",
    "the evolution of an @xmath0-level system can be studied by integrating the corresponding matrix equation in which @xmath23 is replaced by a matrix @xmath24 , each column of which represents an independent state ; one follows the evolution of @xmath24 from the identity matrix @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are anti - hermitian , the solutions of @xmath23 have constant norms @xmath26 and can thus be viewed as lying on a sphere , and the groups that define the complete controllability of eq .",
    "( [ control - equation ] ) for general systems are those summarized in @xcite .    in this paper , we study and independently demonstrate a sufficient condition suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite for establishing controllability of a common class of systems that uses @xmath1 lie algebras , which are smaller , namely of dimension @xmath2 , compared with @xmath4 for @xmath3 or @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "we show that the cartan subalgebra of @xmath12 restricts its application to systems where the free - evolution hamiltonian has a symmetric distribution of energy levels about an average .",
    "these systems are a subset of the general ones discussed in references @xcite . as an example",
    ", we illustrate explicitly that a system with four levels ( a two - qubit system ) is controllable with @xmath6 , which is isomorphic to the @xmath7 and @xmath27 algebras , and which has 10 dimensions and is thus smaller than @xmath9 with its 15 dimensions .",
    "similarly , a system with eight levels ( a three - qubit system ) is controllable with a lie algebra of dimension 36 , significantly smaller than @xmath28 with its 63 dimensions .",
    "the wave function @xmath29 is constructed as a unitary transformation of a reference or pass state  @xcite represented in a geometric representation by the primitive projector @xmath30 .",
    "the unitary transformation is an exponential operator of anti - hermitian elements of the lie algebra for the system : @xmath31 and @xmath30 can be represented by the singular matrix@xmath32 with @xmath33 everywhere except at the upper - left diagonal position .",
    "one can verify the normalization @xmath34 . in this form ,",
    "the wave function , as an element of a clifford algebra , represents an arbitrary single state of the system as a square matrix , corresponding to @xmath35 mentioned in the previous paragraph but with a single nonvanishing column on the leftmost side .",
    "our sufficient condition for a lie algebra that governs the pure - state control of a quantum system is based on the following : the parametrization of the wave function using unitary exponential operators @xmath36 of the lie algebra defines a complete control scheme if we are able to reach an arbitrary ray in the complete state space .",
    "we illustrate the procedure first in general terms and then give explicit examples .",
    "we require that for any pair of basis states @xmath37 of the state space , there exists an anticommuting pair of antihermitian elements @xmath38 of the algebra that relates them:@xmath39 it is important to remember here that the basis states have the projective form ( [ psi ] ) of a minimal left ideal of the algebra .",
    "assuming unit normalization @xmath40 it follows that we can write @xmath41   \\psi_{j}=-i\\exp\\left [   \\mathbf{b}_{kj}\\pi/2\\right ]   \\psi_{j},$ ] and the more general superposition,@xmath42   \\psi_{j}=\\psi_{j}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}+\\psi _ { k}e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\exp\\left (   \\mathbf{c}_{kj}\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right )   \\exp\\left ( \\mathbf{a}_{kj}\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right )   \\exp\\left (   -\\mathbf{c}_{kj}\\frac { \\phi}{2}\\right )   , \\label{transop}\\ ] ] is expressed as a continuous rotation  with real angle parameters @xmath43 in state space , where@xmath44\\ ] ] is another element of the lie algebra and we noted that @xmath45 products of such unitary operators allow transitions from one basis state to any linear combination of the states .",
    "one additional element @xmath46 is needed to simply change the complex phase of @xmath47@xmath48 the elements @xmath49 are generators of the control group and represent the effect of coupling fields . given any initial basis state @xmath50 a general state of the system is a real linear combination@xmath51 of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 generators operating on @xmath54 , where for notational convenience we write @xmath55 in practice , the elements @xmath49 are members of the same small set . as we demonstrate below ,",
    "a set of @xmath0 distinct elements is sufficient to generate a lie algebra of @xmath56 dimensions .",
    "calculating the lie algebra of a higher - dimensional system can require intensive computations , but there is an elegant and efficient approach using techniques of clifford s geometric algebra .",
    "the @xmath0-level quantum system can be described using multivectors in a geometric algebra .",
    "the bivectors are well known as generators of the spin groups , and it has been shown @xcite that in fact every lie group can be represented as a spin group . here",
    "we introduce the possibility of using the full set of anti - hermitian multivectors ( including , for example , trivectors and six - vectors ) to generate the control group .",
    "we illustrate our method with examples of one- and two - qubit systems , and then generalize to show how the control of an @xmath5-qubit system can be achieved by a lie algebra generally smaller than @xmath57      in the simplest example , clifford s geometric algebra @xmath58 of three - dimensional euclidean space enables us to describe a single qubit ( @xmath59 ) @xcite . in this case , pauli spin matrices can represent the three orthonormal vectors ( basis elements of grade  @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 the products of grade @xmath62 @xmath63 form a basis for the bivector space and generate rotations .",
    "there is a single independent element of grade @xmath64 , namely the trivector @xmath65 whose matrix representation is @xmath66 times the unit matrix .",
    "these elements along with the identity span the full linear space of the closed algebra @xmath58 .",
    "we can take the basis states of the system to be @xmath67 and @xmath68 then we note by the pacwoman  property of projectors , @xcite namely @xmath69 that @xmath70 and @xmath71 the @xmath59 generators @xmath72 generate the control lie algebra @xmath73 which is isomorphic to @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ". an arbitrary state can be expressed by@xmath77 which , in fact , is just the euler - angle expression for the bloch - sphere representation the state  @xcite .",
    "note that since the exponents form a closed lie algebra , no generators outside of the algebra arise from an expansion of the unitary operator  @xcite .",
    "we assume a basis for the system in which the free - evolution hamiltonian @xmath78 is diagonal . since commutators ( lie products ) of @xmath78 with the control transformations are to remain within the lie algebra , we need to construct @xmath78 from the unit matrix plus elements of the lie algebra .",
    "to ensure that @xmath78 is diagonal , its contributions from the lie algebra are restricted to the cartan subalgebra , defined as the largest set of commuting generators of the lie algebra .",
    "for the two - state system , the cartan subalgebra of @xmath79 comprises a single element , namely the generator @xmath80 .",
    "we thus construct a general hamiltonian for a two - level system ( apart from an offset energy proportional to the unit matrix ) as @xmath81",
    "for systems of multiple qubits , the orthogonal unit vectors of the appropriate clifford algebra can be represented as tensor products ( kronecker products ) of the pauli matrices as shown in table [ reps ] .",

    "elements of grade 0,1,4,5,8,9 or generally whenever the grade is @xmath106 or @xmath107 , are hermitian whereas those of other grades are anti - hermitian .",
    "this is important because the bivectors on one hand , as well as the complete set of anti - hermitian multivectors on the other hand , form lie algebras of compact groups . in some algebras for euclidean spaces of odd dimension , as for example in @xmath58 or @xmath108 the highest - grade multivector ( the volume element ) is anti - hermitian but commutes with every element of the algebra , and it therefore must be excluded from the set of all anti - hermitian elements that generates the lie algebra .",
