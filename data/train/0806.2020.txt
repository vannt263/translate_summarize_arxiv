    "auxiliary fields , also known as einbein fields , are known for a long time in quantum field theory .",
    "initially they have been introduced to remove the cumbersome square roots appearing in relativistic theories . as an example in string field theory ,",
    "let us cite the nambu - goto lagrangian which is transformed into the polyakov lagrangian @xcite .",
    "they are also of common use in many other fields of physics , such as supersymmetric field theories @xcite and hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "a particular use of the auxiliary fields is the transformation of a semi - relativistic kinetic energy term ( @xmath3 ) appearing in salpeter type equations into an apparently non - relativistic one ( @xmath4 ) leading to a simpler schrdinger - like equation @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach involving auxiliary fields is the transformation of a problem containing a linear confining term into a new one containing a harmonic oscillator potential which can lead to analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "recently , it was realized @xcite that auxiliary fields can be used as a tool to obtain analytical approximate expressions for the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of a schrdinger equation . in this work",
    ", hereafter labelled ssb , we proposed a systematic method , called the auxiliary field method ( afm ) , which gives approximate expressions for the eigenenergies of a non - relativistic two - body system interacting through any local and central potential @xmath0 .",
    "for special forms of this potential , an analytical expression is available . in ssb",
    "we studied in particular power - law and logarithmic potentials and proposed new energy formulae which are much more accurate than those found in literature up to now .",
    "the search for analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation is very interesting and the subject of important investigations .",
    "in fact , only very few potentials give rise to an analytical expression for the eigenenergies valid for any values of the radial quantum number @xmath5 and orbital quantum number @xmath6 .",
    "the most famous are the harmonic oscillator @xmath7 and the coulomb potential @xmath8 .",
    "other potentials have analytical solutions but only for @xmath9-waves ( or in a one - dimensional case ) .",
    "this is in particular the case for the morse potential , the hulthen potential , the hylleraas potential or the eckart potential .",
    "there exist also potentials which are solvable but for particular values of their parameters . among them , the kratzer potential @xmath10 is famous and analytically solvable in the case @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "but even if an exact analytical expression is not available , it may be very interesting to have an approximate analytical expression at our disposal .",
    "in addition to a possible benchmark for numerical calculations , it exhibits the explicit dependence of the energies as a function of the various parameters and of the quantum numbers .",
    "moreover , an analytical expression is always much less time consuming than the corresponding numerical resolution , and is thus of very great help in case of a search for a set of parameters for a potential relying on a chi - square best fit .",
    "several methods have been invoked to find approximate analytical solutions : wkb method , semi - classical treatment , variational methods , perturbation theory , etc . in ssb",
    "we showed that the afm is especially well suited to pursue this goal and presents very pleasant features .",
    "the aim of this work , which extends the results obtained in ssb , is essentially twofold :    * to demonstrate a number of very general and interesting properties of the afm , in particular the connections with the perturbation theory ; * to obtain approximate analytical expressions for a wide class of potentials , some of them being very important and of common use in several domains of physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we demonstrate a number of very general properties concerning the afm .",
    "the third section is devoted to the application of the general theory to very specific but important potentials .",
    "the fourth section deals with a detailed comparison of our analytical results and the corresponding numerical values .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "our goal is the search for approximate analytical expressions of the eigenvalues for a two - body non - relativistic hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reduced mass , @xmath14 the relative distance between particles , @xmath15 the conjugate momentum associated with @xmath16 , and @xmath0 any central potential .",
    "an analytical expression for all the eigenvalues is known explicitly only for very specific potentials @xmath1 .",
    "the basic idea is to rely on such potentials . in other words",
    ", we assume that we are able to obtain an analytical expression @xmath17 for the schrdinger equation @xmath18 \\left| a \\right\\rangle = e(a ) \\left| a \\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] in which , at this stage , @xmath19 is a real parameter .",
    "our method needs the introduction of an auxiliary field @xmath20 , which is _ a priori _ an operator .",
    "we recall here the principle of the method .",
    "it consists in four steps :    1 .   we calculate the function ( the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath14 ) @xmath21 and denote by @xmath22 the value of the auxiliary field which coincides with this function , @xmath23 2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the inverse function of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , one has @xmath26 since both @xmath0 and @xmath1 do exhibit an analytical form , the same property holds for @xmath27 .",
    "but it is by no means sure that @xmath28 can be expressed analytically .",
    "the existence of an analytical expression for @xmath29 is a necessary condition for our method to obtain analytical expressions as a final result .",
    "we build a new hamiltonian @xmath30 which depends the auxiliary field @xmath20 through the following expression @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined by ( [ eq : schrodinit ] ) and where the function @xmath33 is given explicitly by @xmath34 this function @xmath33 makes a bridge between the potential @xmath1 for which an analytical expression is known and the potential @xmath0 for which an analytical expression is _ a priori _ not known .",
    "the very important property is that @xmath22 , coming from ( [ eq : defchaux ] ) , cancels the variation of the new hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath35 . moreover , one has the additional crucial identity @xmath36 , as defined by ( [ eq : hamilinit ] ) .",
    "4 .   considering now @xmath20 no longer as an operator but as a pure number and taking into account ( [ eq : schrodinit ] ) , the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "then , we determine the value @xmath41 that minimizes @xmath42 : @xmath43 . we propose to consider @xmath44 as the approximate eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath45 . in ssb , we presented a bound to test the accuracy of the method . in order to obtain an analytical expression for these eigenvalues ,",
    "we must fulfill a second necessary condition : to be able to determine @xmath41 and , then , @xmath44 in an analytical way .",
    "this method is completely general and _ a priori _ valid for any potential @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , in order to get analytical expressions we must fulfill , as we saw , two conditions : i ) first , to be able to invert relation ( [ eq : defchaux ] ) in order to have access to the function @xmath28 defined by ( [ eq : definvk ] ) ii ) second , to be able to determine @xmath41 and to calculate the corresponding value @xmath44 in an analytical way .",
    "an idea for obtaining analytical expressions of the eigenenergies for an arbitrary potential is the following .",
    "we start with a potential @xmath46}(r)$ ] for which the energies of the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath47}$ ] are exactly known .",
    "we then proceed as above to find approximate solutions for the eigenenergies of a hamiltonian @xmath48}$ ] in which the potential is at present @xmath49}(r)$ ] . in general , a large class of potentials can be treated in that way .",
    "moreover , by comparison with accurate numerical results , we can even refine the expressions in order to be very close to the exact solution .",
    "considering now these approximate expressions as the exact ones , we apply once more the afm with @xmath50}(r)$ ] to obtain approximate solutions for the eigenenergies of a hamiltonian @xmath51}$ ] in which the potential is at present @xmath52}(r)$ ] .",
    "even if analytical solutions for hamiltonian @xmath51}$ ] were not attainable directly with @xmath46}(r)$ ] , it may occur that they indeed are with @xmath50}(r)$ ] .",
    "pursuing recursively such a procedure , one can imagine to get analytical solutions even for complicated potentials . presumably , the quality of the analytical expressions deteriorates with the order of the recursion",
    ".      very rare are the potentials @xmath1 for which an analytical solution is known for all radial @xmath5 and orbital @xmath6 quantum numbers . among them , the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) @xmath53 and the coulomb ( c ) @xmath54 potentials are widely used . taking benefit of this opportunity , the class of power - law potentials ( pl ) has been studied in ssb .",
    "let us consider @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it has been shown in ssb that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath58 can be written under the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 depends on @xmath5 and @xmath6 quantum numbers , as well as @xmath61 .",
    "this formula gives the exact result for the two important situations :    * the harmonic oscillator potential since in this case @xmath62 ; * the coulomb potential for which @xmath63 .",
    "it has been shown in ssb that , for any physical values of @xmath61 ( @xmath64 ) , a good form for @xmath60 is given by @xmath65 some functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 were proposed in ssb in order to give an approximation as precise as @xmath68 for the most interesting ( the lowest ) values of the quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "considering the eigenenergies  ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) and ( [ eq : grandnl ] ) as the ` exact ' ones for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : plpot ] ) , one can apply the afm to get the eigenenergies for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamilinit ] ) . using the recipe given in section [ subsec : princmeth ] with @xmath69",
    ", we find the following results @xmath70 the optimal value @xmath41 being determined from the equation @xmath71 coming from the relation @xmath72 depends only on the potential @xmath0 and not on the particular eigenstate we are interested in . the value @xmath41 depends both on the potential ( through the @xmath29 function ) and on the state under consideration ( through the @xmath60 quantity ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the expression resulting from ( [ eq : enu0frompl ] ) suffers from two approximations :    * the afm is based on the replacement of an operator @xmath20 by an optimal value @xmath41 ; this approximation was discussed is detail in ssb and an estimation of the error was given ; * setting for @xmath60 the value ( [ eq : grandnl ] ) is also an approximation whose quality was discussed extensively in ssb .    in the case of a harmonic oscillator @xmath73 or a coulomb potential @xmath74 ,",
    "only the first type of approximation remains .",
    "the application to the two solvable potentials is immediate :    * for the coulomb potential ( @xmath74 ) , one deduces @xmath75 the function @xmath76 is determined by the condition @xmath77 whereas the value @xmath78 is calculated from the transcendental equation @xmath79 * for the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath73 ) , one has similarly @xmath80 the function @xmath81 is determined by the condition @xmath82 whereas the value @xmath41 is calculated from the transcendental equation @xmath83    the comparison of the expression for the energies in both cases ( [ eq : enerpropcl ] ) and ( [ eq : enerpropho ] ) clearly shows that there must exist a link between them .",
    "this aspect is considered in the next section and indeed we will prove a very interesting property .      in the preceding section , we derived the approximation @xmath86 that can be obtained for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilinit ] ) applying the afm with the starting potential @xmath84",
    ". let us assume that , instead of the starting potential @xmath84 , we are interested by another starting potential @xmath85 . the formulae ( [ eq : enu0frompl])-([eq : jnufrompl ] )",
    "apply as well , changing @xmath61 into @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , one determines a function @xmath88 depending on the auxiliary field @xmath89 , an optimal value @xmath78 depending on a @xmath90 quantity , and the resulting energy @xmath91 . in this last approach ,",
    "let us introduce a new field @xmath20 by the change of variable @xmath92 using the definition of @xmath88 as a function of the potential @xmath93 , this new variable can be defined as well as @xmath94 using the definition of the @xmath29 function ( [ eq : jnufrompl ] ) , it is easy to show the relationship @xmath95 defining @xmath96 , a simple calculation shows that @xmath97 ) but in which the quantity @xmath98 has been replaced by @xmath99 .    to achieve the demonstration ,",
    "let us introduce this value @xmath100 in the expression of @xmath101 . using the link between @xmath41 and @xmath78 , it is easy to show that @xmath102 in the expression derived from the case @xmath84 , it is sufficient to change the value @xmath103 by @xmath104 to obtain the expression derived from the case @xmath85 .",

    "the only reminiscence of the particular chosen potential @xmath84 is the expression of @xmath103 , as given by ( [ eq : grandnl ] ) .",
    "this result holds whatever the form chosen for the potential @xmath0 , even if we are unable to obtain analytical expressions for one case or the other or both .",
    "this property was emphasized in ssb for the particular case of a power - law potential @xmath109 switching from the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath73 ) to the coulomb potential ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we proved here that it is in fact totally general .",
    "it is probably related to a well known property in classical mechanics : one can pass from the motion of a harmonic oscillator to the kepler motion by a canonical transformation .",
    "scaling laws represent an important property for non - relativistic schrdinger equations .",
    "they allow to give the expression for the eigenenergies ( and wave functions ) of the most general equation in terms of the corresponding eigenenergies ( and wave functions ) of a reduced equation which is much simpler to solve .",
    "let us recall briefly the scaling law for the energy .",
    "let @xmath110 be the eigenvalues of a schrdinger equation corresponding to a system of reduced mass @xmath13 subject to a potential of intensity @xmath111 and characteristic inverse length @xmath19 .",
    "the scaling law gives the relationship between @xmath110 and @xmath112 .",

    "now , we choose the arbitrary parameters @xmath117 and @xmath116 in order to fulfill the conditions @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in other words , we impose the following values @xmath120 with these values , ( [ eq : scheq2 ] ) can be recast into the form @xmath121 \\psi'\\left(\\frac{a}{a ' } \\bm{x}\\right)=0.\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eq : scheq1 ] ) can be recovered , provided one makes the identification @xmath122 and a similar relation for the energies .",
    "the scaling law is thus expressed in its most general form as @xmath123 in fact , it is always possible to define the function @xmath114 so that @xmath124 . in",
    "what follows , and without loss of generality , we will apply the scaling law for energies under the form @xmath125 this equality is very powerful since it is valid for the _ exact eigenvalues _ of a non - relativistic schrdinger equation based on an _ arbitrary central potential_. it allows to express the energy in terms of a dimensionless quantity and some dimensioned factors , as we will see below .",
    "the purpose of this section is to prove that the scaling law for energy , as expressed by ( [ eq : scallawgen ] ) still holds for the approximate expressions derived from a treatment based on auxiliary fields .",
    "it was observed in ssb but no proof was given .",
    "the only assumption is that the function @xmath126 is homogeneous , that is we impose the property @xmath127 which implies also @xmath128 .",

    "one deduces the following relations @xmath146 and , after differentiation , @xmath147    now let us consider the value @xmath148.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath149 is obtained from ( see ( [ eq : detmu0 ] ) applied with @xmath150 ) @xmath151 which , because of the property ( [ eq : lienmp ] ) , can be transformed into @xmath152 a comparison between ( [ eq : detmu0 ] ) and ( [ eq : detmu0s ] ) immediately implies that @xmath153 .",
    "thanks to ( [ eq : lienm ] ) , this last identity inserted in ( [ eq : eigenauxp ] ) proves that @xmath154 but this result is precisely what we expect from the scaling law ( see ( [ eq : scallawgen ] ) ) .",
    "we thus proved that scaling law for energy holds as well for the approximate expressions derived by the afm .",
    "this result is almost general in the sense that it is valid whatever the potential under consideration , even if we are unable to obtain analytical solution .",
    "the only restriction is that the function @xmath1 is homogeneous .",
    "this is of no consequence since the potential @xmath155 is used in practice .      given a potential @xmath0 , the method for obtaining approximate solutions using auxiliary fields has been presented extensively in section [ subsec : princmeth ] .",
    "this method can be extended without difficulty for a hamiltonian of type @xmath156 one introduces an auxiliary field as before forgetting about the @xmath157 contribution .",
    "the first 3 steps of the algorithm remain unchanged .",
    "thus the @xmath22 field is the same , as is the same the function @xmath33 .",
    "the only difference arises in the expression ( [ eq : htilde ] ) of @xmath30 and @xmath40 where @xmath158 has to be replaced by @xmath159 . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding energy ( [ eq : enerprop ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath160 @xmath161 is an eigenvalue of hamiltonian @xmath162 where @xmath32 is defined by ( [ eq : schrodinit ] ) and where @xmath163 is an eigenvalue of hamiltonian @xmath164 .",
    "an eigenstate of hamiltonians @xmath165 and @xmath164 is denoted @xmath166 , and we have @xmath167 . if @xmath41 is the value of @xmath20 which minimizes ( [ eq : newenerg ] ) , then we could expect that @xmath168 is a good approximation of @xmath169 , an eigenvalue of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : anu0 ] ) .",
    "it seems that ( [ eq : newenerg ] ) is very similar to ( [ eq : enerprop ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the small difference is important , because , even if the determination of @xmath41 from ( [ eq : enerprop ] ) is technically easy , it may happen that the determination from ( [ eq : newenerg ] ) could be much more involved .    using the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite as in ssb",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath170 so , @xmath171 is a kind of ` average point ' for the potential @xmath1 .",
    "if functions @xmath1 and @xmath0 are not too different , one could expect that @xmath172 and , in particular , that ( see ( [ eq : defchaux ] ) and ( [ eq : definvk ] ) ) @xmath173 within this condition , the optimal value of the constant replacing the auxiliary field operator is close to the mean value of this operator , as mentioned in ssb .",
    "so , afm could actually be considered as a ` mean field approximation ' with respect to a particular auxiliary field which is introduced to simplify the calculations . as it is also shown in ssb , using ( [ eq : anu3 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath174 except @xmath169 , all quantities can be computed analytically in principle . so an estimation of the accuracy of the approximate eigenvalue @xmath175 can be obtained .",
    "it is very instructive to apply ( [ eq : newenerg ] ) for the potential @xmath176 . in this case , the function @xmath177 is unchanged and still given by ( [ eq : jnufrompl ] ) ( with the obvious change @xmath178 ) , while the new value of @xmath41 is given , instead of ( [ eq : nu0frompl ] ) , by @xmath179 in this case , the virial theorem states that @xmath180 with @xmath181 given by ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) .",
    "it is then easy to verify explicitly the equality ( [ eq : anu3 ] ) with @xmath171 given by ( [ eq : nu0frompla ] ) .",

    "a potential that is worthwhile to be studied is the sum of two power - law potentials namely @xmath185 the above considerations show that the @xmath177 function is given by @xmath186 with the consequence that the optimal value @xmath41 is extracted from the equation @xmath187 in general , one does not have an analytical expression for the root of such an equation .",
    "this is possible only for very specific values of the powers @xmath87 and @xmath61 .    in this paper",
    ", we will study such a problem for the most favourable cases , where @xmath87 is chosen to give an exact expression for the eigenvalues ( in practice @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) and where @xmath61 is chosen in order to have an analytical root .",
    "let us assume that @xmath190 with @xmath191 small enough so that @xmath192 .",
    "if @xmath191 is strictly 0 , ( [ eq : anu0 ] ) and ( [ eq : anu2 ] ) show that @xmath20 , and hence @xmath41 , vanishes .",
    "switching on the potential gives a non - vanishing but small value of @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , @xmath193 , so we can expect that @xmath194 .",
    "let us remark that @xmath195 can have a finite value , as it can be seen on ( [ eq : nu0frompla ] ) for the particular case @xmath176 .",
    "> from results of the previous section , we can write @xmath196 using the definition  ( [ eq : defchaux ] ) , the condition @xmath197 implies that @xmath198 it is interesting to compare this relation with ( [ eq : anu3 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pert1 ] ) turns then into @xmath199 expanding @xmath200 and @xmath201 in powers of @xmath191 and keeping only the terms @xmath202 , we obtain @xmath203    for small values of @xmath191 , the contribution of @xmath204 can also be computed in perturbation . with the notations given above , we have then @xmath205 where @xmath206 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath207 .",
    "since @xmath208 and @xmath206 differ only by terms @xmath202 , we have ( see ( [ eq : anu3 ] ) ) @xmath209 if the condition  ( [ eq : anu4 ] ) is fulfilled , we can also write @xmath210 using this result in ( [ eq : pert5 ] ) , we see that @xmath211 and @xmath175 differ only by terms @xmath212 .",

    "we take benefit of the remark of section  [ subsec : extens ] to study potentials of the form @xmath218 . as stated above",
    ", an analytical expression is not necessarily available",

    "unfortunately , the best functional form can not be theoretically predicted . in the cases studied in this paper",
    ", the same form can be given to both coefficients @xmath393 and @xmath394 for a given hamiltonian , but with different parameters .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath289 and @xmath323 can sometimes be exactly computed .",
    "obviously , the parameters for coefficients @xmath393 and @xmath394 depend on the points used for the fit but also on the particular choice of functions ( [ chi2 ] ) and ( [ chi2bis ] ) . other definitions  relative error instead of absolute error , different chosen quantum numbers or different chosen values of @xmath278 in summations  would have given other numbers slightly different .",
    "it is worth noting that , for each case studied , values of @xmath384 obtained directly with coefficients @xmath385 and @xmath386 for the set 2 are generally very close .",
    "the afm was proposed in ssb as a tool to compute approximate analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation and then applied to the case of power - law radial potentials .",
    "the basic idea underlying this method is to replace an arbitrary potential @xmath0 , for which no analytical spectrum is known , by an expression of the type @xmath465 , @xmath1 being a potential for which analytical eigenenergies can be found , @xmath20 the auxiliary field and @xmath33 a well - defined function of this extra parameter .",
    "this auxiliary field is such that its elimination as an operator leads to the original hamiltonian .",
    "if @xmath20 is seen as a number however , analytical eigenenergies and eigenstates can be found , and the auxiliary field is eventually eliminated by a minimization on the eigenenergies .",
    "the approximation in the afm comes thus from the use of the auxiliary field as a number rather than an operator .    in the present work ,",
    "we have further investigated the afm and obtained results that fall mainly in two categories : general properties of the afm and analytical resolution of the schrdinger equation with potentials of the form @xmath466 .",
    "let us first summarize the general properties of the afm that we have proved :    * the analytical expressions that are obtained for the eigenenergies by using the afm preserve the general scaling laws ( [ eq : scallawgenp ] ) in the case where @xmath1 is homogeneous .",
    "thanks to this feature , the number of relevant parameters in the hamiltonian can be seriously reduced in order to simplify the problem . *",
    "let @xmath467 and @xmath468 be two power - law potentials whose eigenenergies respectively read @xmath469 and @xmath470 , where @xmath471 and @xmath472 are terms containing the radial and orbital quantum numbers . then",
    ", if we apply the afm to find the eigenenergies of potential @xmath0 with both @xmath467 and @xmath468 , the final results will have the same functional form , depending either on @xmath471 or on @xmath472 following the case .",
    "* perturbation theory can be reformulated within the afm .",
    "if @xmath191 is a small parameter and if @xmath190 is a potential that can be treated in perturbation , then @xmath473 can be equivalently replaced by @xmath474 with @xmath171 the average point defined by ( [ eq : anu3 ] ) , at the first order in @xmath191 .",
    "such a property could be useful in some cases since no integration is needed with the afm .    finally , it is worth summing up the results that we obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with potentials of the form @xmath466 :    * analytical formulae have been found for several potentials that are relevant in various domain of physics : anharmonic , quadratic plus coulomb and funnel . to our knowledge , it is the first time that such formulae are found .",
    "a comparison with the kratzer and the quadratic plus centrifugal potentials which are analytically solvable is also performed .",
    "* by using the scaling laws , it appears that only one dimensionless parameter , denoted as @xmath278 in this work , ` controls ' the features of the various spectra .",
    "the approximate formulae for eigenenergies can be a complicated function of @xmath278 and of a number @xmath369 containing the radial and orbital quantum numbers .",
    "this number is determined by the potential @xmath1 chosen and is _ a priori _ independent of @xmath278 .",
    "nevertheless , a drastic improvement of the formulae we computed can be obtained by replacing this term @xmath369 by a function of the form @xmath475 , where @xmath393 and @xmath394 have to be fitted on the eigenenergies coming from a numerical resolution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this has finally led us to very accurate formulae for all the various potentials we studied .    as an outlook",
    ", we mention that more complicated potentials could be studied with the afm .",
    "in particular , we plan to apply this method to potentials involving an exponential , like the yukawa potential for example .",
