    "specifically , the amount of zirconia associated with the microspheres was determined from supernatant measurements employing inductively coupled plasma analysis ( indicating weak adsorption ) as well as from scanning angle reflectometry of a silica surface immersed in the nanoparticle solution ( indicating no detectable adsorption at all ) .",
    "we view the former analysis as more representative , since it involves the actual silica microspheres for which the reported phase behavior was determined .    since there are only very few approaches for the stabilization of colloidal suspensions , it is of clear importance to explore the underlying mechanism of these observations .",

    "the effect is considerably less ( cf .  fig .  2 in ref .",
    "secondly , the application of the derjaguin approximation makes the hhf equation valid only for small @xmath52 .",

    "it is important to emphasize that these mean - field approaches are employed only to set up the direct colloid  nanoparticle and nanoparticle  nanoparticle _ pair potentials _ to be employed in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the actual simulations explicitly take into account correlation and fluctuation effects . in addition , as is clear from the use of the hhf equation , the solvent and all ions are modeled implicitly , yielding a dielectric medium with a specific electrostatic screening length .",
    "while the sheer number of solvent molecules and ions precludes their explicit incorporation in the calculation , the strong screening also renders this largely unnecessary .",
    "another noteworthy point is that the calculations presented here only yield the effective colloidal pair potential .",
    "triplet and higher - order interactions , which may become important under the nondilute conditions in the experiments , are not addressed .",
    "the presence of an attractive interaction between microspheres and nanoparticles , as found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ele2.2 ] ) , is consistent with the supernatant measurements reported by tohver",
    "_ et al . _",
    "also their zeta - potential measurements  @xcite ( which exploit the electrophoretic mobility of the microspheres ) indicate a certain degree of microsphere  nanoparticle association , since the increase of the zeta potential with increasing nanoparticle concentration requires a cooperative motion of colloids and nanoparticles .",
    "accordingly , it might be tempting to dismiss the haloing phenomenon as a a standard case of electrostatic stabilization resulting from an effective charge build - up on the colloids . however , as is shown below , the situation is considerably more complicated , since the resulting halo is dynamic in nature and leads to effective interactions that are attractive , repulsive , or oscillatory , depending on nanoparticle concentration .",
    "as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , traditional computational approaches experience severe difficulties in the treatment of this system .",
    "inherent limitations in most computational methodologies greatly restrict the range of accessible size ratios in multi - component mixtures because larger species tend to get trapped by the smaller .",
    "this ergodicity problem becomes more severe if small particles accumulate around larger ones , as is the case in the present system  @xcite .",
    "the simulation methods that are capable of explicitly simulating both large and small species are limited to size ratios up to @xmath55  @xcite , except for a few cases of hard - sphere mixtures .",
    "thus , an alternative route that is sometimes taken is to only simulate the smaller species around a pair of immobile large particles at a fixed separation  @xcite .",
    "since the effective force can be evaluated only for one separation at a time , a series of such simulations for different large - particle distances must be carried out to construct the entire curve for the effective force .",
    "since the large - particle concentration must be kept very small to exclude many - body effects , the total particle number typically becomes very large if the small species is present at a fixed concentration and @xmath56 is large . as a result , this method becomes impractically slow even for moderate accuracy .",
    "we overcome this problem by exploiting a novel , highly efficient monte carlo scheme  @xcite , which permits the explicit inclusion of interacting species of vastly different sizes .",
    "this algorithm is a variant of the geometric cluster algorithm originally introduced by dress and krauth  @xcite .",

    "we employ only two microspheres in a periodic cubic box at concentration @xmath59 . in principle , the potential of mean force must be calculated from simulations in which the nanoparticles are kept at constant chemical potential . for efficiency reasons ,",
    "we instead use the canonical ensemble , in which the number of nanoparticles is constant . since our simulation cell is very large ,",
    "fluctuations in the number of nanoparticles are expected to be small as the microsphere separation varies , and consequently the difference between the two ensembles is expected to be very small  @xcite . in addition , we have explicitly verified that no changes occur in the effective potential as the box size is increased further ( i.e. , @xmath60 is lowered further ) .",

    "again , this is in quite good agreement with the experimentally observed reentrant gelation at @xmath108 , especially in view of the approximate interactions potentials employed .",
    "a natural explanation for the reentrant behavior might be found in a depletion interaction  @xcite induced by the nanoparticles , as suggested in ref .",
    "however , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : high](b ) , the attractive strength increases quadratically with @xmath61 , whereas the classical ao theory for depletion  @xcite predicts an attractive minimum at contact ( @xmath84 ) , with a strength that has a linear concentration dependence .",

    "[ fig : high](b ) does not occur at contact , one could envisage a situation in which both colloids are decorated with a layer of nanoparticles ( effectively increasing the colloid diameter ) and the remaining nanoparticles induce a depletion interaction . while this might account for the position of the potential minimum , it does not account for the quadratic concentration dependence , which persists even after the corresponding adjustment has been made to the nanoparticle concentration employed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : high](b ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the deviation from the linear concentration dependence might be that the strong mutual electrostatic repulsion leads to _ effective _ nanoparticle concentrations that considerably exceed the bare concentrations , causing the system to leave the regime of validity of the ao theory . however , even the effective concentrations are so low that no significant deviations from linearity are expected .",

    "[ fig : parameters](a ) shows the same potentials scaled by the size asymmetry .",

    "this indicates that the energy penalty resulting from nanoparticle rearrangements dominates over depletion - like entropic effects . as discussed in the context of fig .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first to demonstrate that , under the appropriate conditions , the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles alone is sufficient to cause the formation of a nanoparticle monolayer on the microsphere surface . depending on size asymmetry and nanoparticle concentration , it is also possible that the nanoparticles are less strongly bound and that a diffuse halo emerges instead of a monolayer . rather than aiming to precisely reproduce the experimental conditions , ref .",
    "@xcite focuses on general trends .",
    "in particular , it is emphasized that , as a general criterion for the formation of a halo or monolayer , the microsphere diameter must be compared to the average ( bulk ) nanoparticle separation .",
    "evidently , this criterion relies on a sufficiently strong nanoparticle repulsion .",
    "indeed , all calculations were performed for a specific ( large ) choice for the screening length , @xmath146 , i.e. , @xmath147 . if seems doubtful that this criterion is applicable for the very different conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "subsequently , and coincident with the simulation results  @xcite , another integral - equation study was performed by karanikas and louis  @xcite .",
    "they find that , for a suitable parameter choice , the effective microsphere interaction exhibits a dependence on nanoparticle concentration  @xmath61 that is qualitatively compatible with the experimental findings .",
    "initially , and just as found already by chvez _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the nanoparticles induce a repulsive interaction that increases in strength with nanoparticle concentration , resulting in colloidal stabilization at a concentration  @xmath148 . upon further increase of @xmath61 ,",
    "an attractive minimum appears in @xmath145 , which becomes sufficiently strong to lead to reentrant gelation of the colloids at a concentration  @xmath149 .    while the general trends observed in ref .",
    "@xcite are certainly encouraging , we note that there are also important quantitative discrepancies with the experimental  @xcite and simulational  @xcite findings .",
    "various calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite employ a debye screening length of @xmath150 , much larger than the experimental value  @xmath151 and , incidentally , rather close to the choice of chvez _ et al . _",
    "this increases the mutual repulsion between nanoparticles , to the extent where it may alter the mechanism responsible for the observed stabilization .",
    "conversely , in figure  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that for parameter choices closer to the experimental conditions ( e.g. , point `` a '' in this figure , corresponding to a screening length @xmath152 and a nanoparticle contact energy @xmath153 ) , the lower bound of the stability window is shifted to nanoparticle volume fractions that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than in refs .",
    "@xcite , whereas the window is also considerably too narrow , @xmath154 instead of @xmath155 .",
    "karanikas and louis suggest that these differences might stem from the polydisperse nature of the nanoparticles employed in the experiments .",
    "however , small - angle x - ray scattering measurements  @xcite have indicated that the nanoparticles , while certainly not monodisperse , have a size distribution that is considerably narrower than indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath156 rather than @xmath157 )",
    ". nevertheless , these differences are not surprising because karanikas and louis opted not to include an explicit microsphere  nanoparticle attraction .",

    "while , as shown above and in ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of an induced , short - range colloid  nanoparticle attraction can resolve this inconsistency , the inclusion of an attractive interaction  @xmath25 yields rather different results for the screening length chosen in the integral - equation approach  @xcite . if @xmath25 and the nanoparticle repulsion  @xmath24 have a comparable range , bridging attractions arise that have a detrimental effect on colloidal stability . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath25 is relatively long - ranged compared to @xmath24 , bridging is avoided , but also the reentrant gelation is no longer observed for the entire range of nanoparticle volume fractions investigated  @xcite .",
