    "imitation processes correspond to pair interactions of the form @xmath56 their frequency is proportional to the number @xmath35 of interaction partners who may convince an individual of strategy @xmath5 .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath57 is the _ imitation rate_.    relation ( [ prop ] ) is called the _ proportional imitation rule _ and can be shown to be the best learning rule .",
    "it was discovered in 1992 and says that an imitation behavior only takes place , if the strategy @xmath5 of the interaction partner turns out to have a greater success @xmath58 than the own strategy @xmath7 . in such cases ,",
    "the imitation rate is proportional to the difference @xmath59 between the success of the alternative @xmath5 and the previous strategy @xmath7 , i.e. strategy changes occur more often the greater the advantage of the new strategy @xmath5 would be .",
    "all specifications of the type @xmath60   \\label{prop2}\\ ] ] with an arbitrary parameter @xmath61 also lead to the game dynamical equations .",
    "however , individuals would then , with a certain rate , take over the strategy @xmath5 of the interaction partner , even if its success @xmath58 is smaller than that of the previously used strategy @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath62 is not chosen sufficiently large , the individual transition rates @xmath63 can become negative .    in summary , we have found a microscopic foundation of evolutionary game theory which bases on four plausible assumptions : 1 .",
    "individuals evaluate the success of a strategy as its average payoff in interactions with other individuals ( cf .",
    "( [ es ] ) ) .",
    "they compare the success of their strategy with that of the respective interaction partner , basing on observations or an exchange of experiences .",
    "3 . individuals imitate each others behavior .",
    "4 . in doing so",
    ", they apply the proportional imitation rule ( [ prop ] ) [ or ( [ prop2 ] ) ] .",
    "for illustrative reasons , we will now discuss an example which allows to understand how social conventions emerge .",
    "we consider the simple case of two alternative strategies @xmath64 and assume them to be equivalent so that the payoff matrix is symmetrical : @xmath65 if @xmath66 , the additional payoff @xmath67 reflects the _ advantage _ of using the same strategy like the respective interaction partner .",
    "this situation is , for example , given in cases of network externalities like in the historical rivalry between the video systems vhs and beta max . finally , the mutation rates are taken constant , i.e. @xmath68 .    the resulting game dynamical equations are @xmath69    \\big\\ { w_1 + \\nu a p_x(t )    \\big [ p_x(t ) - 1 \\big ] \\big\\ } \\ , .",

    "that is , dependent on the detailled initial condition , one strategy will win the majority of users although both strategies are completely equivalent .",

    "symmetry breaking_. it will be suppressed , if the mutation rate @xmath75 is larger than the advantage effect @xmath76 .",
    "the above model allows to understand how behavioral conventions come about .",
    "examples are the pedestrians preference for the right - hand side ( in europe ) , the revolution direction of clock hands , the direction of writing , or the already mentioned triumph of the video system vhs over beta max .",
    "it is very interesting how the above mentioned symmetry breaking affects the probability distribution @xmath77 of the related stochastic model ( cf .",

    "for @xmath78 the probability distribution is located around @xmath79 and stays small so that the approximate mean value equations are applicable . at the so - called _ critical point _",
    "@xmath80 , a _ phase transition _ to a qualitative different system behavior occurs and the probability distribution becomes very broad . as a consequence , the game dynamical equations do not correctly describe the temporal evolution of the mean strategy distribution anymore .    for @xmath71",
    ", a bimodal and symmetrical probability distribution evolves .",
    "that is , the likelihood that one of the two equivalent strategies will win through is much larger than the likelihood to find approximately equal proportions of both strategies . at the beginning , the initial state or maybe some random fluctuation determines ,",
    "which strategy has better chances to win .",
    "however , in the long run both strategies have exactly the same chance .",
    "it is clear , that in such cases the game dynamical equations fail to describe the mean system behavior ( cf .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , which would correspond to the average temporal evolution of an ensemble of identical social systems . in cases of oscillatory or chaotic solutions of the game dynamical equations",
    "the situation is even worse .",
    "in the last section we have seen that the approximate mean value equations @xmath81 with the so - called _ first jump moments _ @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "( [ not ] ) ) are not sufficient .",
    "this calls for corrected mean value equations and a criterium for the time period of their validity . if the individual transition rates @xmath83 depend on the socioconfiguration , the exact mean value can only be evaluated via formula ( [ av ] ) .",
    "this requires the calculation of the probability distribution @xmath27 and , therefore , the numerical solution of the respective master equation ( [ master ] ) .",

    "suitable _ validity criteria _ are the _ relative variances _",
