    "denoising one - dimensional signals is an important topic which is usually addressed from filter theory in time or frequency domains . in some applications in which processing speed is not a fundamental issue , filters defined in the joint time - frequency domain may be considered , usually improving the filtering process .",
    "examples of this situation are found in electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and other biomedical signals @xcite , human voice analysis @xcite or animal sound analysis @xcite .    with respect to the latter , in previous works @xcite we investigated the use of time - frequency distributions to estimate the number of wolves howling in a giving recording to provide an estimation of the number of individuals in a pack .",
    "this estimation is the basis for counting regional wolf populations which is of interest for both ecological and economic purposes , since authorities must reimburse the cost of cattle killed by this protected specie @xcite . of course , and",
    "despite the quality of recording devices , field recordings are usually affected for a variety of undesirable signals which range from low amplitude broad spectrum long duration signals , like wind , to signals localized in time , like cattle bells , or localized in spectrum , like car engines .",
    "clearly , the addition of all these signals generates an unstructured noise in the background of the wolves chorus which must be treated for a proper signal analysis .",
    "medical signals are another good example of this situation . due to the electromagnetic fields created by measuring devices , the usual low frequency signals to be acquired are contaminated by a background noise which is usually in the same frequency band that the signal of interest .",
    "therefore , fine denoising techniques must be applied to segregate the signal of interest form the noise .",
    "in general , the denoising procedure is not aimed to recovering a clean signal but to produce a clean time - frequency representation of the signal which allows further analysis techniques , for instance and importantly , the instantaneous frequency ( if ) estimation . for the examples given above , if estimation allows to count the number of different individuals howling in the recording ( each individual being identified with an if line ) .",
    "we also provide an example in which the spectrogram energy content of an ecg signal is filtered to identify an arrhythmia episode .    in @xcite , we used nonlinear diffusion image denoising techniques applied to the spectrogram of a sound signal , a wolf chorus .",
    "although , as above mentioned , execution time is not a relevant issue for this type of problems , we found that nonlinear diffusion algorithms require a high computational time , making their use not operative in many situations .",
    "in addition , these filters do not take advantage of the special characteristics of the image produced from the spectrogram , i.e. they operate on the spectrogram as in any other image . in this article",
    "we show that nonlocal filters such as neighborhood filters @xcite are computationally more efficient to deal with these images and give similar results .",
    "moreover , we point out a relationship between the nonlocal means filter @xcite and the neighborhood filter which is exclusive of their implementation on images defined through time - frequency distributions .    the outline of the article is as follows .",
    "we present in section 2 the mathematical framework of the problem and the filtering techniques proposed in this article for one - dimensional signal denoising . in particular , we justify our choice of the neighborhood filter as an inexpensive approximation to the well known nonlocal means filter for the special case of spectrogram images . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the discrete problem and deduce the corresponding formulas for algorithm implementation . apart from the neighborhood filter",
    ", we consider the yaroslavsky - susan @xcite filter and a nonlinear diffusion filter based in the total variation norm @xcite , for comparison porpouses .",
    "then , we demonstrate the performance of these filters by applying them to three noisy signals ( synthetic , wolf chorus and ecg ) and give quantitative comparisons based on the mean square error ( mse ) , and the visual inspection of the processed spectrograms and other related magnitudes .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a one - dimensional signal and @xmath1 be its wigner - ville distribution , defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath4 .",
    "the wigner - ville distribution has received much attention for if estimation due to its excellent concentration for mono - signals and many other desirable mathematical properties , see @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that it presents high amplitude sign - varying cross - terms for multi - component signals which makes its interpretation difficult . for attenuating these interference terms several approaches",
    "have been followed , mainly based on the smoothing of the @xmath5 by convolution with a suitable regularizing kernel .",
    "special mention is due to the spectrogram , which may be defined either as the energy density function of the short time fourier transform @xmath6 for some real , symmetric and normalized window @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 or as the convolution product of the wigner - ville distributions of the signal and the window @xmath9 in practice , for finite time duration and band - limited one - dimensional signals the time - frequency domain is bounded .",
    "let us denote this domain by @xmath10 , and write a generic time - frequency point @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "dropping the dependence on the signal @xmath4 and the window @xmath13 in the notation for the spectrogram , the conservation of energy implies @xmath14 , and the additional assumption @xmath15 implies @xmath16 as may be easily deduced from ( [ gabor])-([spec ] ) .",
    "therefore , after a suitable normalization , we may consider the spectrogram of a signal as an image and apply to it well - known techniques of image denoising and enhancing for the estimation of the underlaying signal .",
    "in addition , the definition of @xmath17 as a convolution product involving the window @xmath13 ensures further regularity when @xmath13 is smooth .",
    "for instance , for gaussian windows , @xmath18 .",
    "first attempts to denoising and enhancing of spectrogram images were made via local differential filters @xcite based on corresponding well established methods , see @xcite , in which the filtering process of a intensity image @xmath19 $ ] at @xmath20 is based only on the intensities in a neighborhood of @xmath12 . although the resulting denoised spectrogram greatly improves the if estimation of the signal , both computational time and low energy harmonic removing were drawbacks which motivated different approaches , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that nonlocal filters such as neighborhood filters are computationally more efficient to deal with these images and give similar results . the main idea in neighborhood filters ,",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description , is to take into account in the filtering process the global gray scale values to define neighboring pixels .",
    "thus , the denoised value at pixel @xmath12 is defined as an average of values at pixels having a gray scale value close to @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting nonlocal algorithm is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a normalization factor .",
    "an interesting variation of the neighborhood filter algorithm is the yaroslavsky filter algorithm @xcite , in which the domain of integration in ( [ def.nf ] ) is restricted to a spatial neighborhood of the base pixel @xmath12 , i.e. to a ball @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is usually taken as the euclidean distance . in this way ,",
    "both local and nonlocal filtering are taken into account .",
    "similar to the yaroslavsky filter , susan @xcite and bilateral @xcite filters incorporate the domain restriction as a weighted distance to the reference pixel @xmath26    according to buades et al .",
    "@xcite , an interpretation of these filters may be given in terms of their asymptotic equivalence to differential diffusion filters , based on the relative size of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath27 is much larger than @xmath28 , @xmath17 is filtered by a heat equation .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the same order , the filter behaves as a filtering - enhancing algorithm depending on the magnitude of @xmath29 , i.e. , as a nonlinear diffusion perona - malik type filter . in the last case ,",
    "if @xmath28 is much larger than @xmath27 , the signal is hardly modified .",
    "the denoising process is usually performed as an iteration of formula ( [ def.nf ] ) by the following scheme @xmath30 with @xmath31 . in singer et al .",
    "@xcite , a probabilistic approach is used for the understanding of iterated neighborhood and nonlocal means filters , see ( [ def.nl])-([def.f ] ) below .",
    "their rate of convergence towards the constant steady state and their blurring properties are analyzed interpreting the successive iterations ( [ def.nfi ] ) as a random walk .",
    "the iterated composition of the corresponding transition probability matrix is then shown to produce the noise reduction at a certain asymptotic rate , acting specially on the high frequency components .",
    "we finish this section by describing an important property which is related to the special character of the spectrogram interpretation as an image .",
    "the nonlocal means algorithm uses , for a noisy image @xmath32 , the following regularization @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the normalization factor , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a gaussian kernel with standard deviation @xmath37 .",
    "the role of function @xmath38 is to weight the point - wise euclidean distance based similarity of @xmath39 on _ gaussian neighborhoods _ @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the averaging procedure of ( [ def.nl ] ) .",
    "relaxing this effect to perform , instead of point - wise , averaged euclidean distance comparisons on gaussian neighborhoods for @xmath42 , i.e. redefining @xmath38 as @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is obtained by using the gaussian @xmath46 as convolution kernel in ( [ specwv ] ) , for a gaussian window @xmath47 of zero mean and standard deviation @xmath37 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , considering the regularization of @xmath42 via ( [ def.nl])-([def.f ] ) , we obtain @xmath48 which is in close relation to ( [ def.nfi ] ) once the first iteration approximates the integrand @xmath42 to @xmath49 . thus , in a loose sense , the nonlocal means algorithm applied to the wigner - ville distribution of a signal is related to the direct application of the neighborhood filter to the spectrogram of the signal , as obtained through a gaussian window .",
    "in this section we present numerical demonstrations on spectrograms of synthetic and biomedical signals of the nonlocal neighborhood filter ( [ def.nfi ] ) , the yaroslavsky filter ( [ def.y ] ) iterated as in ( [ def.nfi ] ) , and a total variation based pde local filter , see ( [ pde])-([id ] ) below . in order to compare the results",
    ", we use an objective measure , the mean square error ( mse ) between the denoised and the clean signals , and a subjective measure based on the visual inspection of the spectrogram itself and on some related magnitudes : the if lines and the time - energy content .",
    "computation of the spectrogram is a standard operation performed by applying the discrete fast fourier transform ( dfft ) to the convolution of the signal with the window , which we choose as a zero mean unit variance gaussian window .",
    "once the spectrogram is produced , it is normalized in some range @xmath50 $ ] , with @xmath51 , obtaining in this way a discrete function @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the choice @xmath53 corresponds to the usual digital image range .",
    "let us consider the regular mesh of @xmath54 , as produced by the spectrogram computation , given by @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for @xmath59 , and consider the corresponding barycenters @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to each @xmath60",
    "we associate a surface element @xmath63 .    for @xmath64 , we consider the @xmath65quantized spectrogram @xmath66 if @xmath67 $ ] , for @xmath68 , inducing the partition of @xmath10 given by @xmath69 according to eq .",
    "( [ def.nfi ] ) for the iteration of the neighborhood filter , and using ( [ partition ] ) , we define for @xmath70 , and for the iteration index @xmath71 @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "we consider the zero - order approximations @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the number on nodes contained in @xmath76 .",
    "relabeling @xmath77 in terms of its level sets , the approximation to formula ( [ f.1 ] ) ( for which we keep the same notation ) reads @xmath78 or , in a more compact form @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 denoting the scalar product in @xmath82 .    in a similar way",
    ", we may find the following expression for the iteration of the yaroslavsky type filter given by ( [ def.y ] ) .",
    "however , for this filter we can not operate on terms of level sets , and a particular expression for each @xmath83 must be given , explaining the large time execution differences between neighborhood and yaroslavsky filtering : @xmath84 approximating the integral terms as in ( [ int.app ] ) , we obtain @xmath85    finally , for comparison porpouses , we used the following denoising algorithm based on a convection - diffusion nonlinear pde related to that introduced by rudin et al .",
    "the problem is written as : find @xmath86\\times \\o\\to [ 0,q]$ ] such that @xmath87\\times\\o   \\label{pde } ,   \\\\[0.1 cm ] & & { \\nabla}s \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=0 { \\quad\\text{on } }     [ 0,\\frac{1}{{\\varepsilon}}]\\times\\partial\\o , \\label{bc } \\\\ & & s(0,\\cdot)=s_0 { \\quad\\text{in } } \\o , \\label{id}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 , with @xmath36 a gaussian regularizing kernel of variance @xmath37 . here",
    ", @xmath89 controls the strength of transport towards the maxima of @xmath90 , in relation to the mean curvature diffusion term .",
    "the addition of the transport term in ( [ pde ] ) , as well as the bounded _ time _ domain @xmath91 $ ] , which are not usual in image denoising algorithms , are motivated by the notion of differential reassignment introduced by auger et al .",
    "@xcite , which is proper of one - dimensional signals , see @xcite for further details .",
    "the discretization of ( [ pde])-([id ] ) follows the standard finite element methodology for the total variation denoising problem , see @xcite .",
