    "supernova remnant ( snr ) 0540 - 69.3 ( henceforth simply 0540 ) has been observed at wavelengths ranging from x - rays to the radio .",
    "both in the radio @xcite and in x - rays @xcite , the remnant is bounded by an outer shell , which has a radius of at least @xmath8 .        inside the outer shell ,",
    "the emission from the remnant is concentrated to a substantially smaller nebula @xcite . in [ o  iii ]",
    "( @xmath9   ) , the diameter is @xmath10 ( henceforth we will refer to this as the ` central part of the snr ' ( snrc ) ) . in this and other lines , the emission appears to mainly come from a few blobs and filaments .",
    "the snrc also emits an optical continuum , believed to be synchrotron emission from the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "such a nebula is expected since the remnant harbors the young pulsar psr b0540 - 69 which is observed to emit in x - rays @xcite , in the optical @xcite , and in the radio @xcite .",
    "the snrc with its pulsar bears many similarities to the crab nebula , which is why 0540 is sometimes referred to as the crab s twin . a detailed comparison of psr b0540 - 69 with the crab pulsar and its pwn can be found in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the snrc is dominated by forbidden oxygen and sulphur lines . from the strong oxygen lines it has been classified as an `` oxygen - rich snr '' ( osnr ) .",
    "this class of objects has a handful of members , of which cas a is the most studied object ( e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , cas a is not pulsar - powered , although a point - like x - ray source has been detected near its center @xcite .",
    "thus 0540 is an interesting link between pulsar - powered remnants and osnrs . here",
    "we present some new results for this object obtained with the eso ntt and vlt , and with the hst .",
    "observations of 0540 were performed on 1996  january 17 , using the eso ntt telescope with the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) .",
    "narrow - band images in [ o  iii ]  ( @xmath9   ) were obtained using a zero velocity [ o iii]@xmath110 filter and an exposure time of 30 minutes .",
    "the pixel size was 0268 .",
    "we also carried out low - resolution ( 2.3 @xmath11pixel ) long - slit spectroscopy of 0540 in the 3850 - 8450    range .",
    "the [ o  iii]@xmath110 image is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : oiiiim ] ( _ left _ ) , where we also show the slit position of the ntt spectral observation ( marked by `` 2 '' ) .",
    "further spectroscopic observations were carried out in the 36006060    range on 2002 january 9 and 10 with the eso vlt telescope using the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 1 ( fors1 ) with a dispersion of 1.18  @xmath11pixel , and a spatial scale of 02 per pixel .",
    "total exposure times of 154 and 132 minutes were used for the two slit positions , marked by `` 1 '' and `` 3 '' in fig .",
    "[ f : oiiiim ] , respectively .",
    "slits 1 and 2 were chosen to include the snrc and the pulsar . slit 3",
    "does not cross the snrc , but was placed to probe emission from the outer shell in a region where it is most clearly identified in the chandra x - ray image @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ f : oiiiim ] , right ) . the chandra image in fig .",
    "[ f : oiiiim ] was obtained on 1999 november 22 with the acis - s in the @xmath12 kev range with a spatial resolution of 0492 per pixel using a total exposure time of 27.8 ks .",
    "all spectroscopic observations were performed using a slit width of  1  and the seeing was generally about 1 .",
    "the 0540 field has also been imaged with the hst / wfpc2 on several occasions in various bands .",
    "data for observations through the f336w , f502n , f547 m , f673n and f791w filters were obtained on 1999 october 17 using total exposure times of 600  s , 11000  s , 800  s , 8200  s and 400  s , respectively @xcite .",
    "data in the narrow band f658n and wide band f555w filters were obtained on 1995 october 19 with 4000  s , and 600  s exposures , respectively @xcite .",
    "we retrieved these images from the hst archive and used them in our analysis .",
    "the snrc was exposed on the planetary camera ( pc ) chip with a spatial resolution of 0046 per pixel revealing the pulsar and the structure of its pwn ( fig .",
    "[ f : f547im ] ) , as well as the fine structure of the snrc and its neighborhood .",
    "all the data obtained have been reduced and calibrated in a standard way ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the snrc were carried out in detail by kirshner et al .",
    "( 1989 ) @xcite using a larger slit width ( @xmath13 ) and at a different position angle . to compare our results with theirs",
    ", we extracted 1d spectra of the snrc from our spectral images using the iraf procedure apall and spatial extents of 10  and 8  centered on the pulsar for slits  1 \" and  2 \" , respectively .",
    "the extracted windows correspond to the observed extents of the snrc along the respective slit directions .",
    "the extracted vlt spectrum from slit 1 shown in fig .",
    "[ f : snrs_sp ] is consistent with that of kirshner et al .",
    "however , the higher sensitivity and spectral resolution of the vlt observations also allow us to find many new lines not previously detected .",
    "the most important findings are [ ne  iii]@xmath143869 , 3967 and balmer lines of hydrogen all the way down to h  i  @xmath153889 .",
    "these lines are marked in fig .  3 and detected at least at @xmath16 significance level .",
    "they belong to the snr material , and not to the lmc background , since the measured shifts of their line centroids correspond to a velocity of  @xmath17 , which is consistent with the velocities of the much stronger [ o  iii ] and [ s  ii ] lines",
    ". moreover , the lines are velocity broadened to the same extent ( a typical width is @xmath18 ) as other lines emitted by the remnant . while the neon lines can be used to derive an o / ne ratio which in turn constrains the progenitor mass ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the balmer lines show that the previously detected emission around h@xmath19 is at least partly due to h@xmath19 , and not only to [ n  ii ]  @xmath156583 or any other line as previously discussed @xcite .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath20 } = \\frac{i(\\lambda6716)}{i(\\lambda6731)}$ ] is sensitive to the electron number density , @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the two components of [ s  ii ] detected using slit 2 , blend together because of the velocity broadening of the emitting gas in 0540 .",
    "there are , however , a few positions along the slit for which a deblending is possible . from various fits to the line profiles at these positions , we obtained @xmath20 } \\approx 0.7\\pm0.1 $ ] . to estimate the density",
    ", we used the multilevel model for s  ii described in @xcite , but with atomic data further updated according to @xcite . adopting the above @xmath20}$ ] value we obtain @xmath22 assuming the temperature @xmath23 k and @xmath24 at @xmath25 k. the lower temperature is probably more likely considering our findings for [ o  iii ] ( see below ) , so a reasonable density range is @xmath26 .",
    "this is similar to the density in the crab nebula for which [ o  ii ] and [ s  ii ] line ratios indicate electron densities in the range of @xmath27 for various filaments observed @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from fig . 3 , [ o  iii]@xmath284363",
    "is clearly detected in the spectrum of the snrc of 0540 .",
    "this enables us to estimate the temperature from the flux ratio @xmath29 } = \\frac{i(\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007)}{i(\\lambda4363)}$ ] , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a complication for 0540 is , however , that lines from the snrc are blended due to velocity broadening . in particular ,",
    "[ ne  iii]@xmath143869 , 3967 and [ o  iii]@xmath284363 are contaminated by h  i lines .",
    "this leads to an underestimate of @xmath29}$ ] , and consequently an overestimate of the temperature if deblending is not made . to deblend these lines we used h@xmath30 as a template profile for all h  i lines .",
    "incorporating a six - level model atom for o  iii from @xcite gives @xmath31  k ( for the electron density we found above from [ s  ii ] ) .",
    "although our [ o  iii ] temperature is significantly lower than that of @xcite , who estimated @xmath32  k without taking deblending into account , it is still much higher than in normal h  ii regions .",
    "the corresponding temperature in the crab nebula is in the range @xmath33  k @xcite , and is thought to mainly arise from photoionization heating @xcite .",
    "our value of @xmath34 from [ o  iii ] may point in the direction of shock heating not being the sole source of heating of the snrc of 0540 since photoionization by a hard spectrum , like in the crab , can also give rise to high [ o  iii ] temperatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "modeling is needed to sort out which source of heating dominates in the snrc of 0540 .",
    "0540 is near the lmc h  ii region dem 269 and the ob association lh 104 @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in our spectroscopic images which contain strong , narrow emission lines that vary spatially in strength along the slits .",
    "these lines are significantly narrower ( actually unresolved ) than the lines from the snrc of 0540.to study whether or not some of the h  ii ( or at least emission - line ) regions are affected by the snr activity , we selected several filaments detected along our slits and analyzed their spectra .",
    "many of the filaments actually do show highly ionized ions ( as mainly deduced from iron ) as expected for regions close to the x - ray emitting parts of the remnant .",
    "the filaments we studied in greater detail were along the vlt slits  1 \" and  3 \" , and they are marked f1 , f2 , f4 , f5 in fig .  [ f : oiiiim ] .",
    "for reference we also looked at a filament ( named f3 ) which in projection is situated 14 from the pulsar ( to the east , and outside the region shown in fig .  1 ) . while f3 can still be affected by the radiation field of 0540 , it clearly can not be shock excited by the remnant .",
    "filament f1 , which in projection is the closest one to the snrc , is remarkably hot , @xmath35  k. filaments f2 , f4 and f5 are closer to the outer shock front detected in x - rays ( as seen in projection ) , and they all have temperatures in excess of @xmath36 k. the reference filament f3 has an [ o  iii ] temperature of @xmath37 k. the temperatures of all filaments ( even that of f3 ) are substantially higher than in normal h  ii regions . despite the fact that lmc is less metal - rich than the milky way , and metal line cooling in h  ii regions",
    "is therefore expected to be less efficient there , typical [ o  iii ] temperatures in , e.g. , the 30 doradus region vary rather mildly ( @xmath38  k ) from the average value of 10270  k @xcite .",
    "the high temperature of filaments f1-f5 around the snrc of 0540 suggests that they are all affected by the remnant .",
    "the spectral resolution of our fors1 observations is @xmath39 at [ o  iii ]  @xmath155007   , but the line center of the filament lines can be determined to within a fraction of this ( @xmath40 ) for the strongest lines .",
    "taking filament f3 as a reference , all the other filaments around 0540 are consistent with having their line center velocities within this @xmath41 uncertainty range . in the young remnant of sn  1987a",
    ", the shocked gas in the inner ring has displacements that are marginally larger than @xmath42 @xcite , but the effect is certainly not large enough for us to rule out shocks as the excitation mechanism for the 0540 filaments .",
    "sn  1987a also shows that the draping of the blast wave around the ring clumps produces line profiles with widths that are in excess of the spectral resolution of our 0540 observations .",
    "this may pose a stronger constraint on the shock hypothesis for the 0540 filaments than the lack of line displacement , as we do not see any broadening ( beyond the instrumental broadening ) of the 0540 filament lines @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that both the line displacement and the line broadening are geometry dependent , and the geometry may certainly be less extreme in the 0540 filaments than in the ring clumps of sn  1987a . a shock imprint on the emission lines may therefore be less obvious for 0540 than for sn 1987a .",
    "an alternative , or maybe complementary , excitation scenario for filaments f1 , f2 , f4 and f5 around 0540 is that they are photoionized by a time - varying euv / x - ray source .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that [ o  iii ] temperatures of several times @xmath43  k can be attained in such a case .",
    "the ionizing source could in this case be naturally provided by the x - rays created when the blast wave overtakes 0540 filaments . modeling to test the photoionization scenario is in progress @xcite .",
    "observations with better spectral resolution will also help to resolve the excitation mechanism .",
    "is one of a few pulsars for which a near - uv and optical spectrum has been reported .",
    "hill et al .",
    "@xcite obtained a time - integrated near - uv spectrum with hst / fos and middleditch et al .",
    "@xcite used time - resolved photometry to establish a broadband ground - based ubvri ` spectrum ' in the optical .",
    "these two investigations show , however , a significant difference in the absolute flux in the spectral range where they overlap . to check this mismatch we used two recent sets of data ,",
    "one is our vlt / fors spectroscopy of 0540 , and the other is the hst / wfpc2 imaging @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopic and photometric results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : psropt ] @xcite .",
    "considered separately , they are in good agreement with previous results .",
    "however , they do not erase the significant discrepancy between the spectroscopic and photometric data sets , which is much larger than the statistical uncertainties of our measurements . the only plausible explanation to this discrepancy is that the hst / fos spectroscopy is strongly contaminated by the pwn . as an additional test we measured the pulsar flux in the f336w , f547 m , f555w , and f791w bands , using a circular aperture with a radius of 10 pc - pixels ( total diameter of 092 ) centered on the pulsar , without subtraction of the background .",
    "these conditions reproduce the parameters of the spectral measurements within a circular aperture of almost the same diameter ( 086 ) made with the hst / fos by hill et al .  1997 @xcite .",
    "the 10-pixel fluxes are much closer to the hst and vlt spectral fluxes .",
    "we estimate that within a 10 pixel radius , the pwn contributes at least 50% .",
    "this can also be seen by comparing our accurate pulsar photometry with our 10 pixel test @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the previously published spectral data on the pulsar emission can not be considered as reliable .",
    "our broadband hst ` spectrum ' ( or rather broad - band spectral energy distribution ) of the pulsar , where the background from the nebula has been accurately subtracted off , can be considered as a fair estimate of the pulsar spectral energy distribution .",
    "it has a nonthermal origin and is described by a power law , @xmath44 , with the spectral index @xmath45 , while that of middleditch et al .",
    "has @xmath46 using updated dereddening corrections",
    ". the flatter spectrum of middleditch et al .",
    "@xcite is partially due to a spectral jump upwards for the u band that could be due to a systematic flux error in this band .",
    "the position of  is defined on the hst pc chip frames with an accuracy of better than 0.17 pc pixels which corresponds to 00077 .",
    "this allows a direct estimate of the proper motion of the pulsar using an accurate superposition of the f555w and f547 m images taken at epochs separated by 3.995 years . using the positions of 9 reference stars to construct the coordinate transformation between the two images , we find a proper motion @xmath47 mas yr@xmath6 in the south - east direction ( see fig .  [",
    "f : f547im ] ) at a position angle of @xmath48 ( projected along the southern jet of its pwn ) .",
    "the significance of this result is low and can be considered only as an attempt to make a first direct measurement of the proper motion .",
    "based on the displacement between the pulsar optical position and the center of the pwn , as seen in radio , manchester et al .",
    "1993b @xcite argued for a similar value of the proper motion but in the south - west direction ( in the plane of the pwn torus , as seen in projection ) .",
    "we note that the proper motion of the crab pulsar is projected along the symmetry axis of the inner crab nebula , as defined by the direction of the pwn jet discovered by rosat , and that a similar situation applies to the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "if our estimates are confirmed , we have the intriguing situation that all these three young pulsars move along their jet axes . however , while the crab and vela pulsars both have transverse velocities of @xmath49 , our results for   indicate a much higher value of 1190@xmath50 , assuming a distance to the lmc of 51 kpc . a third epoch of hst imaging is clearly needed to establish this result at a higher significance level .",
