    "in his pioneering work ( more than eighty years ago ) faxen @xcite considered motion of a spherical particle suspended in a fluid confined by two parallel walls .",
    "a recent , considerable interest in particle motion in confined geometries has been stimulated by development of new experimental techniques @xcite and by emerging applications , such as the microfluidic devices @xcite and technologies for production of microstructured materials by a self - assembly process @xcite .",
    "there have been published a number of fundamental experimental and numerical studies on particle dynamics in channels with parallel planar walls for suspensions of brownian @xcite and non - brownian @xcite particles .",
    "some of these studies focused on quasi - two - dimensional phenomena @xcite , and some on bulk properties , such as particle migration in the pressure - driven @xcite or shear @xcite flow .",
    "quantitative numerical studies of wall - bounded suspensions require efficient methods for evaluation of multi - particle hydrodynamic interactions in these systems .",
    "some interesting numerical results were obtained with the help of the wall - superposition approximation @xcite or by modeling the walls as arrays of immobile spheres @xcite .",
    "these approaches seem sufficient for describing certain qualitative features of wall - bounded suspensions ( e.g. , in stokesian - dynamic simulations of hydrodynamic particle diffusion ) but the accuracy of such approximations is often unknown .",
    "moreover , in some cases , they entirely miss certain important phenomena .",
    "for example , the superposition approximation reproduces neither the large transverse resistance coefficient of rigid arrays of spheres @xcite nor the enhanced relative transverse particle motion , observed by cui _",
    "_ @xcite and independently predicted by our recent analysis @xcite .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we have developed an accurate cartesian - representation method for evaluation of multiparticle hydrodynamic interactions in wall - bounded suspensions of spheres @xcite .",
    "( a related approach was also independently proposed by jones @xcite . )",
    "our method relies on expanding the flow in a wall - bounded system using two basis sets of stokes flows .",
    "the spherical basis set of multipolar flows is used to describe the interaction of the fluid with the particles , and the cartesian basis set is used to account for the presence of the walls .    in our previous studies ,",
    "the cartesian - representation method was applied to determine the resistance functions for systems of spheres in quiescent fluid @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend these results to suspensions in a pressure - driven external flow .",
    "we note that the one - particle motion in such a system was investigated by jones @xcite and staben _ et al . _",
