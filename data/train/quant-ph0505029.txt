    "mathematically speaking , any trace @xmath89 positive operator is a state on the space state in which it is defined .",
    "physically , however , this seems a poor justification .",
    "moreover , why one can consider this four - dimensional linear space as a two - qubit system and obtain conclusions about its entanglement ?    to answer this questions we need to consider an interplay of two aspects of quantum theory : photodetection and post - selection . in a first quantized notation ,",
    "if the electromagnetic field state is described by @xmath44 and we make a one - photon detection described by the annihilation operator @xmath90 , the field state after such measurement will be given by @xmath91 , properly renormalized ( _ i.e. _ : the conditional state ) . as photodetection is a destructive measurement , after the click , @xmath92 describes the state of the remaining photons .",
    "if , however , we have a non - destructive one - photon detector , this post - selected `` detected photon '' would be described by the pure fock state @xmath93 of the mode annihilated by @xmath90 .",
    "but what if we just have a non - destructive one - photon detector similar to the one above , except by the fact that it clicks for any one - photon superposition of two specific modes ( _ e.g. _ : two polarizations of one and the same spatial mode ) .",
    "this situation is analogous to a degenerate spectrum projective measurement .",
    "the state of the post - selected photon will preserve the coherence which it possibly had between the two modes , being described by a linear combination like @xmath94 , or , more generally , by a density operator @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the projector @xmath97 , and again properly normalized .",
    "clearly , the state of this two - level system describes the unresolved mode combination ( in the example , the polarization degree of freedom ) .    if we detect two spatially distinguishable photons , but each of them with unresolved polarizations , the first quantized notation becomes cumbersome , but the ideas involved are the same , and the remaining two - qubit state describes the polarization degree of freedom of this two distinguished photons .    the same reasoning , with two fermions spatially localized ar @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but with unresolved spin , in second quantized notation , give rise to eq .",
    ", that then describes the spin state of the two localized fermions@xcite . in this sense , ( normalized ) second order correlation functions can be considered as quantum states , and its entanglement properties can be studied , as is done in this paper ."

    "<S> we investigate the effects of fuzzy measurements on spin entanglement for identical particles , both fermions and bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider an ideal measurement apparatus and define operators that detect the symmetry of the spatial and spin part of the density matrix as a function of particle distance . </S>",
    "<S> then , moving on to realistic devices that can only detect the position of the particle to within a certain spread , it was surprisingly found that the entanglement between particles increases with the broadening of detection .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is one of the most studied subjects in contemporary physics . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum mechanical property is the core of a whole new area in physics , mathematics and computation , known as quantum information theory . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been perceived as a useful resource for different technological applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however much has still to be done in order to completely understand these non - classical correlations . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important aspects that still deserves further investigation concerns the actual observation of entanglement due to the indistinguishable character of the quantum world .    </S>",
    "<S> usually , when talking about entanglement , one tends to ignore the role of the measurement apparatus , always considering ideal situations . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no such a thing as an ideal detector , and the detector bandwidth affects the measurement of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the particular case of identical particles , it is still not clear how the symmetry of detection in external degrees of freedom affects the entanglement of the internal ones .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyze these questions in two different systems : a gas of non - interacting fermions at zero temperature and a photonic interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we analyze how the measurement of external degrees of freedom can affect the entanglement in internal degrees of freedom in a system of identical particles . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show how the symmetry of detection affects the entanglement of two fermions detected in a non - interacting fermion gas at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study how imperfect detections affect the observation of entanglement both for the fermionic gas and also for an interferometer of photons .    </S>",
    "<S> recently vedral showed that the entanglement between two particles in a non - interacting fermi gas at zero temperature decreases with increasing distance from each other  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vedral also shows that there is a limit below which any two fermions extracted from the gas are certainly entangled . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if both fermions are extracted at the same position , then the pauli exclusion principle forces their spin to be maximally entangled in a typical antisymmetric bell state .    in order to calculate the upper limit for guaranteed entanglement , the author used the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite , which in his paper , corresponds to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 is the distance between the fermions , @xmath3 is the fermi momentum and @xmath4 is a spherical bessel function . in order to obtain this result , the author defines ( apart from normalization ) the spin density matrix of these two particles from the second order correlation function ( see the appendix for a justification ) @xmath5 which corresponds to measuring these two fermions at positions @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the subscriptions @xmath8,@xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 refer to the spin of the particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state @xmath12 is the ground state of the fermi system @xmath13 and the detection operator at position @xmath6 and spin @xmath8 is given by , @xmath14 a typical interpretation of this result is related to the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions of each fermion .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a clearer and more complete explanation to this behavior through the analysis of the symmetry of the position detection . </S>",
    "<S> to do so let us define new detection operators :    @xmath15    the operator @xmath16 , detects the antisymmetric ( symmetric ) spatial part and the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) spin part of fermion wavefunction .    in terms of these new operators , eq.([dm1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> becomes :    @xmath17 [ \\pi^{+}_{ss'}(r , r')+\\pi^{-}_{ss'}(r , r')]|\\phi_0\\rangle \\label{dm2}\\ ] ]    note that written in this way , the two - fermion density matrix is the sum of four different terms , two of which contain only symmetric and antisymmetric spin detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the other two are the crossing terms , which vanish due to the exclusion principle ( spin and position of two fermions can not be both symmetric or antisymmetric ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining terms are :    @xmath18    here @xmath19 takes into consideration only the symmetric spin function ( therefore , it is related to the detection of the antisymmetric part of the spatial wavefunction ) while @xmath20 contains only the antisymmetric spin function ( therefore related to the detection of the symmetric part of the spatial wavefunction ) . </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix can be rewritten as : @xmath21 first , note that , as expected , for @xmath22 , the antisymmetric spatial function goes to zero , and the spin wavefunction has to be antisymmetric ( first term in eq.([dmf2 ] ) ) . for @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> both parts contribute . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the symmetric spin density matrix can be viewed as an equal weight mixture of the three triplet components , and has no entanglement at all ( by the peres - horodecki criterion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin state in eq.([dmf2 ] ) represents a convex combination of singlet state and the equal mixture of triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> it will have entanglement iff the fraction of singlet is sufficiently larger than the fraction of triplets , in a similar context to the calculation of _ relative robustness _  @xcite . in the limit @xmath24 , as the integrals on eq.([dmf2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> are performed over momenta below the ( momentum equivalent of ) fermi surface the momentum dependent terms oscillate too fast , and average to zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spin density matrix becomes just the identity ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be seen as a smooth transition from a quantum statistics ( fermi - dirac ) to a classical one ( maxwell - boltzmann ) .    another way of analyzing eq.([dmf2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is given in ref.@xcite , where the authors describe @xmath26 as a werner state . </S>",
    "<S> here , it becomes clear how the symmetry of the spatial detection is influencing the behavior of the spins , and also why there is no entanglement from @xmath27 on .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question arises when considering non - punctual ( non - ideal ) position detections , i.e. more realistic apparatus that detect the position of those fermions with some uncertain . instead of eq.([psi ] ) , the detection operator should be written as the general field operator : @xmath28 the perfect position measurement situation is the particular case of eq.([genpsi1 ] ) corresponding to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath30 has some position uncertainty , like , for example , if it is described by a gaussian with spread @xmath31 , @xmath32 then , the field operators become @xmath33 these operators , when substituted back in eq.([dm1 ] ) , give :    @xmath34    with @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the `` error function '' , defined via : @xmath39 [ dmsub ]    in order to make clearer the behavior of entanglement in relation to changes in @xmath40 and @xmath31 we can compute the negativity ( @xmath41 )  @xcite of the state @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this entanglement quantifier was chosen because it is an _ </S>",
    "<S> entanglement monotone _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( _ i.e. _ : satisfies all the required features of a good entanglement quantifier ) , and also it is easy to calculate . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 is equal to twice the absolute value of the negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose of @xmath44 , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 measures by how much @xmath45 fails to be positive semi - definite quantifies only non - positive - partial - transpose states , nppt - states . </S>",
    "<S> however it is not a problem here because every 2-qubit entangled state is a nppt - state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 reads as @xmath46 where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this function is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ neg ] for some values of @xmath31 .     vs. @xmath40 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( grey ) , @xmath50 ( magenta ) and @xmath51 ( black).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    note that , for imperfect position detection , the entanglement decreases as the detectors become apart from each other , but increases if the spread in the detection becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that inaccuracy in the detection increases entanglement seems surprising . </S>",
    "<S> however it has to be noted that as our knowledge in position gets worst , our knowledge in momentum gets better . in the limit of infinite spread , </S>",
    "<S> both detectors become perfect momentum detectors ( centered at @xmath52 , see eq . ) , which means again that their spin wavefunction should be totally antisymmetrized , hence they are found in the antisymmetric bell state . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that eq . </S>",
    "<S> describes a coherent combination of localized field operators instead of a statistical average of them . </S>",
    "<S> that is the reason for the infinite spread limit be a momentum - localized detector instead of just a vague `` there is a particle somewhere '' .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation can be found in a bosonic system calculating the entanglement in polarization between photons placed in an interferometer using polarization beam splitters ( pbs ) . in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> the polarization and frequency of the photons play the role of the spin and momentum of the fermionic case . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of interferometry has been extensively studied in practical experiments @xcite and thus , in principle , the results presented here could be tested experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> first we write the modes after the pbs if the modes before it are @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see fig.[fig : interferometro ] ) :    @xmath55    with @xmath56 and @xmath57 being the transmissivity and reflectivity of the @xmath58 polarization in the pbs , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the propagation times from the crystal to the detectors via path 1 and path 2 respectively .     </S>",
    "<S> +    the two particle density matrix is again defined through the second - order correlation function : @xmath62 the state @xmath63 is prepared by the two - photon creation operator @xmath64 with frequency distribution @xmath65 which is , in the more general case , polarization dependent . </S>",
    "<S> note that this calculation is more general than a typical hong - ou - mandel interferometer , since one is free to choose initial states by @xmath66 . in a way similar to eq . </S>",
    "<S> , detection is represented by a function @xmath67 .    using the commutation relation for bosons and evaluating the integrals in @xmath68 and the summations in @xmath69 we find </S>",
    "<S> :    @xmath70    the pbs is an optical element which allows transmission in only one polarization ( say vertical ) , and reflection in the other one ( horizontal ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients of transmissivity and reflectivity can be written as @xmath71 and @xmath72 . with this , and assuming a symmetric state in polarization ( @xmath73 ) , the unique non - vanishing coefficients are :    @xmath74    in order to carry on the calculations , let us assume particular distributions for the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are more interested in the detection properties , let us first assume that @xmath75 is constant . </S>",
    "<S> then , we assume independent gaussian detectors , which means @xmath77 and @xmath78 now , we can calculate the polarization density matrix , obtaining , up to normalization , @xmath79 and @xmath80 evaluating these fourier transforms of gaussian functions we obtain @xmath81 the ( normalized ) polarization density matrix then is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the partial transposition of @xmath44 has always one negative eigenvalue equal to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> so the negativity of @xmath44 is @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that as the detector becomes broader in frequencies or the time delay between the two arms of the interferometer becomes larger , the entanglement between detected photon pairs decreases . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that time delay gives rise to which path information , while broadening in frequencies opposes to such labeling .    </S>",
    "<S> again we can see the state @xmath44 as a combination of bell states . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in the interferometric process described here the separation is between the states @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in the following way : @xmath88 and no more between symmetric and antisymmetric states as in equation ( [ dmf2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion it was shown that the measurement apparatus plays a central role in the entanglement of identical particles . </S>",
    "<S> that entanglement increases because of broadening in detection can sound weird at first . </S>",
    "<S> however it is important to say that the detections discussed here are done in a coherent way ( as in most of real cases ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we have modeled the imperfect detectors as a cluster of perfect detectors things would be different . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the relation between identical particle entanglement ( _ i.e. _ : the correlations due exclusively to indistinguishability ) and the entanglement generated by direct interaction among the particles is not completely understood . despite of that the framework presented here can be , _ a priori _ , also applied for interacting particle systems and then could make this relation less obscure . </S>"
