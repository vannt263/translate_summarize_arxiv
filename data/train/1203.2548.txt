    "this ideal case can be destabilized by several mechanisms , like spin polarization or the formation of a charge density wave along the wire direction , which could give rise to a peierls - like situation,@xcite to check these possibilities we have doubled our unit cell in the y - direction to obtain a ( 4@xmath02 ) cell in which we have two inequivalent db - silicon atoms .    first , we have calculated the frequencies of the system to check its stability , finding an imaginary frequency which reveals that the system is in a saddle point . in the mode corresponding to this frequency one of the atoms in the db - wire",

    "we have not found any more complicated configuration which could exist when increasing the unit cell size .",
    "actually , the distorted solution resembles the dimer buckling which appears in the non - hydrogenated si(100 ) surface , and therefore we believe it is the most stable configuration that can be found by geometrical relaxation of the system .      another possibility to destabilize",
    "the ideal db - wire is to have a spin - polarization of the system .",
    "we have used the ( 4@xmath02 ) unit cell , considering ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings between the atoms in the db wire .",
    "the fm case is less stable than the ideal db - wire by 27  mev / db , but the afm one is more stable by 41  mev / db .",
    "each si atom in the db - wire has a magnetic moment of 0.50@xmath6 , and couples antiferromagneticaly to its neighbors in the wire . in fig .",

    "[ bands]c ) , with a direct ( indirect ) band gap of 0.55  ev ( 0.50  ev ) . in this case",
    "the occupied band has contributions from the majority spin of one silicon atom in the db - wire , and the minority of the adjacent , while in the unoccupied band we find the minority spin of the first atom , and the majority of the second .",
    "it is interesting to note that both mechanisms of wire destabilization are not compatible .",
    "the relaxed geometry of the afm wire is essentially identical to the ideal case in a ( 4@xmath01 ) unit cell . inducing a zig - zag distortion within",

    "the small energy difference between the solutions of the order of mev reveals that both are competing and , in practice , other effects like temperature would determine which case could be experimentally observed . to analyze the nature of this competition , lee and cho",
    "@xcite have studied the db - wires in c and ge , and they have compared them to the si case . they have shown that the on - site electron - electron interactions , modelized by a hubbard-@xmath7 term , are the origin of the afm coupling , and their strength decreases as we go down in the periodic table from c to ge .",
    "the smaller atoms have the larger @xmath7 .",
    "this effect has also been reported in the magnetization of sic surfaces when an impurity is adsorbed on a db , showing different behavior on whether the impurity adsorbs on a c atom or a si one due to the larger @xmath7 of the c atom.@xcite    the distorted nm case is due to the electron - lattice coupling , which increases following the same sequence .",
    "thus , while for c the afm case is clearly the most stable , for ge the distorted configuration is lower in energy .",
    "si is in an intermediate case where a competition between both situations is observed .",
    "the instabilities found for the 1-d db wire have the common underlying principle that the electronic energy of the system is greatly reduced if a gap opens in the ideal metallic db wire .",
    "this gap opening is driven either by the geometrical distortion of the wire also known as peierls instability  @xcite or by the spin polarization of the electronic states.@xcite    in the peierls instability , the geometrical distortion increases the system s energy , but the gain in electronic energy overcompensates the ionic energy loss .",
    "this can be estimated by separating the global energy gain @xmath8 in an electronic , @xmath9 and an ionic .",
    "@xmath10 components .",
    "the first component can be expressed by the difference between the electronic energy of the distorted and ideal systems .",
    "this energy is given by the sum over all occupied electronic states , hence @xmath11 where @xmath12 refers to the electronic density of states .",
    "this quantity is easily evaluated and gives @xmath13  ev .    from table",
    "[ tab1 ] we know that the global energy gain @xmath8 for two db is @xmath14 ev .",
    "then , the energy used to distort two db in the wire is then @xmath15 ev .",
    "similarly , spin polarization is favorable only in certain situations.@xcite typically , the gain produced by the opening of the gap has to overcome the tendency to pair spins in electronic states .",
    "a stoner - like criterion  @xcite for local electronic states shows that spin polarization is energetically possible if the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion , @xmath7 , is larger that the energy spread of electronic states at the fermi energy .",
    "this energy spread is basically the inverse of the @xmath12 at the fermi energy , @xmath16 .",
    "hence , spin polarization becomes energetically favorable when @xmath17 hence , the larger @xmath7 is the more likely it is to find an afm ground state for the db wire .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for c(100 ) db wires .",
    "@xcite diamond surfaces are actually prone to developing afm groundstates  @xcite due to the large valuer of @xmath7 and the quasi 1-d arrangement of atoms on certain surfaces . indeed , in ref .",
    "the computed values of @xmath7 are 3.45 ev for c db wires , while only 1.71 ev for the si ones . taking @xmath18 ev@xmath19 , from the metallic band of the ideal wire , we obtain @xmath20 . despite being larger than 1",
    ", this value is not very big , showing the minor tendency of the si db wires to become spin polarized .",
    "this argument is closely related to the fact that the energy of the afm solution is slightly larger than the peierls one , tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] .",
    "the afm solution is driven by superexchange due to the second layer si atoms , ruling out ferromagnetic solutions for the ground state of the db wire .",
    "it is easy to visualize the superexchange mechanism in these wires since the second layer has negligible spin polarization and it is covalently bound to the spin polarized db orbitals .",
    "hence , spins pair between the db and the second - layer atom , while the second - layer atom is shared between to neighboring db that forcedly have opposite spins to keep the second - layer atom unpolarized . see the scheme of fig .  [ scheme ] .",
    "scheme for the superexchange mechanism leading to the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state of the db wire .",
    "the second - layer atoms are not polarized .",
    "the covalent bond with the db atoms is represented by a dashed line .",
    "the spin pairing in these covalent bonds force the afm ordering of the db spins . ]      a crucial aspect to study before considering db - wires for any technological application is the chemical stability of the system .",
    "one of the mechanisms which could destabilize the db - wires is the surface diffusion of hydrogen atoms , which by bonding with a silicon db along the wire would eliminate one db , modifying the wire electronic transport properties.@xcite the new h atom could come from several sources .",
    "let us first consider how the diffusion of hydrogen from the adjacent si in the dimer would affect the stability of the wire in the y - direction .    to perform the study we have used a ( @xmath21 ) unit cell , with enough atoms in the db - wire to consider the h impurity as isolated along the wire s direction .",
    "first , we have calculated the energy difference of having one h moving to the db - wire from the closest position , as shown in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "the final relaxed energy is 0.18  ev higher in energy than the pristine wire with all h aligned on one side of the row and the other side forming the db wire .",
    "creating one h vacancy by displacing it to the db wire is not energetically favorable .",
    "we have also calculated the energy barrier of the process using the nudge elastic band ( neb ) method.@xcite the predicted reaction path is shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ diff ] . the transition state is shown in fig .  [ diff ]",
    "( b ) , and it corresponds to a large barrier of 1.47  ev .",
    "therefore , in principle the db - wire would be stable vs. this kind of processes .",
    "our theoretical barrier of 1.47  ev is in excellent agreement with the measured value of 1.46  ev.@xcite however , the experimental situation does not correspond to the same situation computed here . here , we are interested in the intradimer diffusion when an infinite db wire is form . in the experiment , they rather have a two - db wire ( formed by the desorption of a h@xmath22 molecule after a laser pulse ) and have intradimer diffusion .",
    "this situation corresponds to the one of finite wires that we will see in section  [ finiteh ] .",
    "( color online ) reaction path for the diffusion of one and two hydrogens to the db - wire from the adjacent dimer , as shown in the upper panels .",
    "the color code is the same of fig .",
    "[ geom ] . ]    in the case that a hydrogen atom has already jumped to the db - wire , we may ask which would be the probability for a second h to jump , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diff ]  ( d ) .",
    "this final configuration is 0.01  ev lower in energy than the previous one , and the energy barrier is also lowered to 0.94  ev , as shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ diff ] . hence after the first hydrogen has jumped",
    ", it is easier for a second hydrogen to do the same , than for the first one to jump back .",
    "however , the lowest total energy is found in the later situation showing that the pristine wire is more stable .    alternatively , after the first hydrogen jumps it could diffuse along the wire , jumping to the next db .",
    "our calculations yield that this intrarow diffusion would decrease the final total energy in 0.23  ev . after the pristine wire",
    ", the lower - energy state corresponds then to an h atom that has diffused across the dimer and along the wire .",
    "the barrier associated to the intrarow diffusion is 1.44  ev .",
    "this result also shows that it would not be easy for a h atom to diffuse along a db wire .",
    "even if an extra h atom is placed in the db wire coming from another source the intrarow diffusion is large , amounting to 1.36  ev , similar in value to the previous intrarow - diffusion barrier .    experimentally , the reported values for intrarow - diffusion barriers are about 1.68 - 1.75 ev.@xcite these are @xmath23-ev higher than our computed value .",
    "discrepancies are probably due to the different h coverage of the two systems compared here .",
    "indeed , thorough computations  @xcite with different h coverages yield a @xmath24-ev difference between their computed high h - coverage and low coverage limits .    in conclusion ,",
    "our stability studies show that the diffusion of hydrogen to the wire or along it is not a very favorable process , with associated energy barriers between 1 and 1.5  ev . therefore a db wire can be considered as a quite stable structure when considering those lateral and on line h surface diffusions .",

    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ finitos ] , and compared with previous results from lee  _ et al_.@xcite    in general , we observe that the magnetic solutions are favored for all the finite wire sizes .",
    "the afm solution is the most stable in all cases , although the nm - distorted case competes more in energy as the db - wire length is increased .",
    "even the fm case , which was less stable than the ideal case for the infinite wires , is preferred to the distorted case for the smaller cases , up to 3-db in our siesta and vasp calculations , and up to 5-db in the ones from lee  _ et al_.@xcite    vasp and siesta methods give a similar behavior , with the results shifted by almost a constant amount .",
    "this systematic discrepancy ( less than 10 mev ) is most likely due to the different treatment of the core electrons in both methods : paw potentials@xcite for vasp and norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite for siesta .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ finitos ] a pronounced even - odd oscillation is found .",

    "their origin was assigned by lee  _ et al _ to the presence of a half - filled electronic state for the odd wires,@xcite which destabilize them compared to the even ones .",
    "actually , in our calculations we observe that the nm - distorted solution for the odd wires is a local minimum only if the system is forced to be non magnetic . if spin polarization is allowed , the nm - distorted solution is not longer stable and it evolves until converging to the afm solution .    the results from lee  _",
    "et al _ agree well with ours for the magnetic cases , but there is a discrepancy for the nm - distorted situations . here , our vasp and siesta calculations predict a higher stability for the even - numbered wires , which make the even - odd oscillations in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ finitos ] more pronounced in our case .",
    "we assign this discrepancy to the need of a thorough atomic relaxation .",
    "curiously enough , the agreement is better for the spurious nm - distorted solutions in the odd - numbered wires .    due to the different number of atoms in the finite wires",
    ", even - numbered nm - distorted wires can have a lone si atom in the second layer that plays the role of a soliton wall.@xcite the average distortion increases as we increase the length of the wire , reaching its maximum for the infinite one .",
    "however , the convergence is fast , and for the 6-db the values are very close to the infinite - wire ones . in the afm configuration",
    "the values for the local magnetic moments are the same to the infinite case ( 0.50@xmath6 ) except at the edges , where they increase to 0.56@xmath6 .    in general",
    ", we can conclude that , for the finite wires , the magnetic cases are more favorable than the distortion of the lattice , probably because of the increased electronic confinement of the system .",

    "these results are in good agreement with previous calculations at different levels of h coverage on si ( 001 ) , where a systematic larger intrarow barrier is found compared to the intradimer one.@xcite diffusion between rows is about one ev larger than the intrarow diffusion barrier  @xcite and we can effectively neglect it as a threat to the db - wire stability .",
    "consequently , the finite wires can also be considered as stable following this criterion .",
    "the present article shows the properties of quasi 1-d wires formed by lines of dangling - bonds ( db ) created by the removal of h atoms from a monohydride si ( 100 ) surface . in particular , emphasis is put on their stability and their capacity to be used in molecular - based devices .",
