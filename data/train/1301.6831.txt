    "topological insulators ( tis)@xcite , as a class of materials with insulating bulk states , but conducting surface states , have been theoretically proposed@xcite and experimentally realized both in two dimensions , such as hgte quantum wells@xcite , and three dimensions@xcite , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family of materials@xcite . for three dimensional ( 3d ) tis , for example , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , the surface state consisting of a single two dimensional ( 2d ) dirac cone with the gapless dirac point protected by time reversal symmetry since the two components of the dirac cone are kramers partners . for simplicity",
    ", we can regard these two components as `` spin '' .",
    "the 2d surface state exhibits a novel `` spin - momentum locking''@xcite , in the sense that the `` spin '' is locked and points perpendicularly to the momentum , forming a left - hand helical texture in the momentum space .",
    "therefore , the surface state of tis is also dubbed `` helical metals '' ( hms)@xcite . for a finite fermi energy @xmath2 , the hm possesses a plasmon excitation similar to graphene with the dispersion @xmath3 in the long wavelength limit ( the momentum @xmath4 ) . but different from graphene , this plasmon excitation is coupled to the spin wave due to the helical nature , leading to a novel `` spin - plasmon '' mode@xcite .    another intriguing feature of a hm is the hall response due to the lift of the degeneracy at the dirac point by the breaking of time reversal symmetry , when the surface of tis is coated by a ferromagnetic layer , or doped with magnetic atoms , which provide magnetization normal to the surface .",
    "if the fermi surface lies inside the magneto - bandgap , the hall conductance is half quantized as @xmath5 , known as `` half quantum hall effect''@xcite . in case of a finite fermi surface , the hall conductance is no longer quantized , but still non - zero . for a non - zero hall response ,",
    "the longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic self - excitations are coupled , forming a magnetoplasmon , similar to that in the conventional metals in a strong magnetic field@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask what is the behavior of the `` spin - plasmon '' mode in the magnetically doped hms .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the interaction between electromagnetic fields and hms on the surface of a ti with magnetic doping , focusing on the plasmon excitation . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the correlation function for a 2d single layer of hms and discuss how the `` spin - plasmon '' mode is affected by the magnetic doping .",
    "the electromagnetic waves exist in three dimensions and can not interact strongly with the 2d hms , so we consider a model with multilayers of hms , with an alternating stacking of tis and normal insulators . based on the dielectric function of this model , we discuss the propagating modes of the electromagnetic waves in hms , in sec .",
    "the conclusion is drawn in sec .",
    "we start from the calculation of the correlation function of a single layer of hms on the surface(@xmath6 plane ) of tis with magnetic doping . the single particle hamiltonian@xcite for this system is written by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the pauli matrices",

    ", the rotation symmetry is restored and the correlation function is restricted to the following form @xmath25 where we only keep the momentum independent term for both the diagonal part @xmath26 and the hall response @xmath27 , which are calculated straightforwardly as @xmath28 ,    \\label{eq : sl_chi0}\\\\ & & \\chi_h(\\omega ) = \\frac{e^2m}{4\\pi \\hbar^2}f(x ) , \\label{eq : sl_chih}\\\\ & & f(x)\\equiv\\ln \\left| \\frac{1+x}{1-x } \\right| + i \\pi\\theta(x-1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 .",
