    "+ in this note we used the entropy of the register to measure the `` degree of certainty '' ( fidelity ) with which the output state is reached ; but figure [ fig : fignew ] suggests also to use the register as a _ probe _ to visualize what happens in the cursor when it interacts with the environment in more complicated ways .",
