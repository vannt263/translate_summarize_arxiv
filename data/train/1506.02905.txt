    "fluctuation relations are central to our present understanding of statistical mechanics .",
    "their long and distinguished history goes back to at least the studies by callen and welton @xcite , green @xcite and kubo @xcite , which were inspired by the works of einstein on the brownian movement @xcite and of johnson @xcite and nyquist @xcite on noise in electrical circuits .",
    "the derivation by jarzynski of a rather general non - equilibrium work relation @xcite , linking the average of the exponential of the work being performed on a system with the equilibrium free energy difference between initial and final equilibrium states of the system , is of particular interest .",
    "subsequently , crooks @xcite obtained the jarzynski equality from a relation between the probability of a given amount of work being performed on a system and the probability that the system performs the same amount of work on its surroundings if the time - reversed protocol is undertaken .",
    "such heightened interest in non - equilibrium work relations has not only been fuelled by novel theoretical advances in out - of - equilibrium dynamics , but also by experimental progress in preparing and probing non - equilibrium evolution ( see @xcite for reviews on the subject ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose a relatively simple yet realistic experiment based on a proposal by crooks @xcite , which would allow for a direct test of the crooks - tasaki fluctuation relation .",
    "the experimental system we consider consists of a normal - metal / insulator / superconducting ( nis ) junction between a superconductor and a normal metal , which is initially short - circuited and is subjected to a given voltage protocol ( see below ) .",
    "we establish that for the proposed protocol , the full work distribution - function has non - gaussian character with a non - standard decay exponent .",
    "we also compute the first two moments of such distribution , which can be determined experimentally by measuring the average heat released and its variance .    in order to obtain a closed expression for the characteristic function of the work distribution",
    ", we derive an equivalence between the dynamics of an nis junction and the one of an assembly of two - level systems subjected to a circularly polarized field . using this mapping ,",
    "the work distribution is determined . for realistic parameters of experimentally available nis junctions as _",
    "e.g. _ those of ref .",
    "@xcite , our findings show that at cryogenic temperatures , even the tiny amounts of heat released will result in a measurable volume change for a probe connected to the junction .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : sect .",
    "[ secper ] places the recent developments briefly outlined above into their proper historical context and reviews the theoretical tools necessary to study work - fluctuation relations at the quantum level . in sect .",
    "[ sechm ] , we introduce the hamiltonian of the nis junction and describe in detail the work protocol applied to the system . in sect .",
    "[ secdw ] , we use results that are derived in [ secmap ] and [ secgenfun ] to compute both the average work dissipated as well as its fluctuations and the full work distribution .",
    "[ apb ] contains an extension of the results presented in [ secgenfun ] and [ secaptun ] contains a discussion of a method of measurement of the tunnelling amplitude that describes the nis junction .",
    "section [ seciso ] contains the main result of our paper , where we compute the numerical value of the average heat released on a nis junction such as the ones discussed in ref .",
    ". we leave to [ appim ] the discussion of the experimental techniques that can be used to measure such a quantity .",
    "in particular , we show that the heat that is released can be measured by determining the volume change of a probe that absorbs it .",
    "we provide estimates of the relative volume change , which should be measurable using capacitive methods   @xcite .",
    "finally , in sect .  [ secconc ] , we present our conclusions . for increased readability , most technical details have been relegated to the appendices .",
    "in this section , we give a brief historical overview of the evolution of the subject of non - equilibrium fluctuation theorems .",
    "besides the early contributions already mentioned above , a statement of a general fluctuation theorem involving the free energy of a gas of hard - spheres , interacting at large distances via the lennard - jones potential , can be found in the work of zwanzig @xcite . a subsequent important development was the work of bochkov and kuzovlev @xcite , which also concerned the relation of probabilities between a given work protocol and its time reversed version , but which adopted a different perspective to that of jarzynski and crooks , namely the former authors considered the generalised force that performs work on the system as being external to the dynamical description of the system , rather than internal .",
    "another significant contribution was the work of evans and searles ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which considers the relation between the probability for a dynamical trajectory characterised by a certain value of a dissipation function and its time - reversed counterpart .",
    "regarding developments concerning the validity and extension of the jarzynski - crooks relations at the classical level , see the experimental works @xcite and the theoretical ones @xcite , the above list not being exhaustive .",
    "a quantum generalisation of the crooks equality was obtained by tasaki @xcite and also by kurchan @xcite ( for the case of cyclic protocols ) .",
    "a version of the jarzynski equality valid for quantum systems was also derived by yukawa @xcite , albeit treating work at a quantum level as an observable , a view that was shown not to be correct @xcite .",
    "such a view lead in the past to a debate concerning the validity of such fluctuation relations at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "the extension of the jarzynski equality to isolated systems , using the definition of the work distribution function of tasaki and kurchan , is due to mukamel @xcite .",
    "a quantum generalisation of the work of bochkov and kuzovlev referred above , as well as a clarification of the relation of their work to that of jarzynski and crooks , can be found in a paper by campisi et al .",
    "extensions of non - equilibrium work relations to isolated systems ( micro - canonical fluctuation theorems ) are given in @xcite , whereas work relations valid for arbitrary open quantum systems were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the last reference shows the validity of such theorems for systems that can arbitrarily exchange heat with the bath while a work protocol is being applied to them ( see also below ) .",
    "other theoretical developments concerning quantum systems can be found in the references @xcite , where again the list is not exhaustive .    at the experimental level ,",
    "several proposals to demonstrate the validity of the crooks - tasaki relation in the quantum domain have been presented , including the use of a series of projective measurements @xcite , the measurement of this relation in the optical spectra of systems subjected to weak quenches @xcite , or the use of qubit interferometry @xcite .",
    "the former as well as the latter proposal have been successfully implemented , see @xcite .",
    "an example of the experimental confirmation of a generalised version of the jarzynski equality in the quantum domain was discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , a discussion of possible solid state experiments performed on quantum heat engines is given in @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned proposal by crooks @xcite relies on an indirect method of observation namely , the measurement of the heat released by a quantum system after a cyclic work protocol has been performed on the system . a specific set - up to measure the heat released by a circuit including a resistor and a cooper - pair box , based on the temperature increase of a local probe , was already presented in @xcite , where the cooper - pair box acts as a single two - level system .",
    "the present proposal has the additional advantage that the heat released scales with the contact area between the normal - metal and the superconducting films .",
    "the work probability distribution , @xmath0 , is defined , for a class of work protocols where the system is decoupled from the thermal bath during the application of the protocol ( see below ) , of duration @xmath1 , as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the eigenstates of the system s hamiltonian at the beginning of the protocol , @xmath4 ( which is given for the nis junction by ( [ eqhmc ] ) at @xmath5 , see below ) , and @xmath6 are the corresponding eigenvalues , and where @xmath7 are the eigenstates of the system s hamiltonian at the end of the protocol , @xmath8 ( which is given by the same equation at @xmath9 ) , with @xmath10 being the corresponding eigenvalues , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the operator @xmath13 is the time - evolution operator of the system during the protocol , i.e. in the interval @xmath14 $ ] , which can be written as a time - ordered exponential of the full hamiltonian of the system , given for a nis junction by eq .",
    "( [ eqhmc ] ) .",
    "the work characteristic - function of the nis junction is the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ pwb ] ) , and is given by @xmath15\\ , , \\label{charnis}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the density matrix of the junction before the application of the protocol .",
    "the unitary evolution of the system in the interval @xmath14 $ ] reflects the work protocol s restriction mentioned above , i.e. the nis junction is disconnected from the thermal bath at @xmath5 and remains adiabatically insulated while the protocol is being applied , being reconnected to the thermal bath at @xmath9 and undergoing equilibration through the exchange of heat with the bath afterwards .",
    "it is possible to lift such a restriction on the protocol by explicitly considering the interaction of the system with the thermal bath @xcite , but we will not consider such an extension here , see however the discussion below .",
    "the knowledge of the work characteristic - function allows one to compute all work moments .",
    "if one performs the analytic continuation @xmath17 in the above definition and uses the cyclic character of the trace operation , one obtains @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the partition function for a junction in equilibrium , described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , @xmath20 being the difference in free - energies between the final equilibrium state ( after thermalisation at a time @xmath21 ) and the initial equilibrium state at @xmath5 . since in our case the hamiltonian goes through a cycle , @xmath22 . expressing @xmath23 through its fourier transform , we obtain @xmath24 which is a statement of the jarzynski equality , which the work probability distribution satisfies by definition . considering the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , using again the cyclic character of the trace",
    ", it is possible to derive the identity @xmath27 where by @xmath28 we denote the work probability distribution for the time - reversed protocol .",
    "this is a statement of the crooks - tasaki relation .",
    "note that in the case of cyclic protocols , one also has @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the internal energy of the system .",
    "therefore , from the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the average heat released by the system on which the work protocol is applied , we obtain @xmath33 , which shows that for cyclic protocols the measurement of the released heat allows for the determination of @xmath34 , as stated .",
    "the nis junction is composed of a normal - metal film , a thin insulating layer and a superconducting film .",
    "we consider that such a junction can be described by an hamiltonian consisting of three terms : a fermi - gas describing the normal - metal film , a bcs superconductor describing the superconducting film and a tunnelling hamiltonian coupling the two @xcite , which gives rise to induced superconductivity in the normal - metal film through the proximity effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we use the hamiltonian @xmath35 the operator @xmath36 is a free - fermion hamiltonian describing the normal - metal , with @xmath37 being the voltage difference across the junction , whose value changes in time . the operator @xmath38 is the hamiltonian describing the bcs superconductor , where the pairing function @xmath39 is different from zero on a band of width @xmath40 around the fermi - level , where @xmath41 is the superconducting material s debye frequency . finally , the third term of eq .",
    "( [ eqhmc ] ) is given by @xmath42 and represents the tunnelling process across the junction .",
    "we consider the overall tunnelling matrix element to be small with respect to the gap function @xmath39 .",
    "such matrix element is taken to be invariant under time - reversal , i.e. @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the fermions momentum is directed along the plane of the films and we assume it to be conserved in a tunnelling process .",
    "we will measure the kinetic energy of electrons in the normal - metal film and in the superconducting film with respect to their common fermi - energy @xmath44 .",
    "the super- or subscripts _ n _ and _ s _ refer to operators or quantities pertaining to the normal - metal or to the superconductor , respectively . the magnitude of the tunnelling amplitude will depend on the width of the aluminium oxide layer and its value can be adequately measured for a given device using the method discussed in [ secaptun ] . in this method ,",
    "the power dissipated by the junction is measured at a constant applied voltage equal in value to the energy gap of the superconductor ( divided by @xmath45 ) , which is much larger than the value used in our protocol .",
    "we consider the nis to be initially ( @xmath46 ) in equilibrium with an heat bath at temperature @xmath47 and that the voltage @xmath48 across the junction is zero .",
    "such voltage is changed from @xmath49 to a finite value @xmath50 and returned to zero within a finite time - interval starting at @xmath5 and ending at @xmath9 . during such an interval",
    "the junction is decoupled from the heat bath . for simplicity , we consider that the voltage protocol is symmetric with respect to the mid - point of the interval @xmath51",
    ". however , the calculation presented in [ secmap ] is valid for more general protocols .",
    "also , @xmath37 varies smoothly within a time - interval @xmath52 and is returned to zero at the end of the protocol within the same time frame ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ( b ) ) .    physically , for small values of the tunnelling amplitude , the term given by eq .",
    "( [ eqhx ] ) leads to the opening of a gap between the energy bands of the normal metal , of magnitude @xmath53 , leaving the energy bands of the superconductor largely unaffected .",
    "this is the proximity effect @xcite . in our protocol",
    ", we place ourselves within a particular adiabatic limit , i.e. we will consider that the switching - time @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the value of the gap - function within the superconductor .",
    "thus , the voltage difference across the junction is held approximately constant within the microscopic time - scale of the superconductor and the change of voltage does not induce transitions which involve the superconducting bands . however , we also take @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that the dynamics is fully diabatic with respect to the separation between the two energy - bands in the normal metal and thus that the voltage protocol induces transitions between these bands , leading to work being performed on the system , see [ secgenfun ] .",
    "using the hamiltonian for an nis junction and the voltage protocol specified , the work probability distribution can be obtained using eq .",
    "( [ charnis ] ) , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "in this section , we establish that the dynamics of the nis junction is equivalent to that of an assembly of quantum spins in a time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "this entails an equality between the work probability distributions of both systems , from which it follows that one can compute the average heat released by the nis junction , as well as its higher order fluctuations .    starting from eq .",
    "( [ eqhmc ] ) , the explicit dependence of the hamiltonian on the time - dependent bias voltage can be eliminated by a gauge transformation at the expense of acquiring a time - dependent hopping term between the normal and superconducting films .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "anticipating that , in general , @xmath60 , one can , in the specific adiabatic limit discussed above , perform a generalised schrieffer - wolff transformation that takes into account the explicit time - dependence of @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , such a transformation can only be performed if @xmath62 , see [ secmap ] .",
    "after such a transformation , the metal and superconducting films effectively decouple and only the transformed metallic excitations are subjected to the time - dependent bias .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath63 , which describes the normal - metal film , explicitly reads @xmath64 where @xmath65}\\ , , \\label{eqnemod_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are , respectively , the renormalized kinetic energy of electrons and the induced superconducting parameter , in the normal metal , due to the proximity effect , @xmath66 being the energy of the superconducting excitations .",
    "this result is shown in detail in [ secmap ] .",
    "we thus conclude that for spin - independent tunnelling matrix elements , the hamiltonian describing the normal - metal is equivalent , in each @xmath67 subspace , to the hamiltonian of a two - level system under the action of a circularly polarised field .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian that describes the superconductor does not contribute to the work - characteristic function , see [ secmap ] .",
    "one can obtain the work characteristic function for a nis junction simply by considering the product of individual characteristic - functions for two - level systems subjected to a circularly polarised field , see [ secgenfun ] .",
    "the logarithm of the overall work characteristic - function , which is the generating function of the connected work - moments , is given by @xmath68}{\\cosh\\left(\\beta\\sqrt{|\\delta^n_\\mathbf{k}|^2+(\\tilde{\\xi}_\\mathbf{k}^n)^2}\\right ) } \\right\\}\\ , , \\label{charfas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath69 .",
    "the detailed calculation can be found in [ secgenfun ] .",
    "the average work dissipated per atom in the normal - metal film , @xmath70 , is obtained from the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ charfas ] ) , evaluated at @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total number of atoms in the normal - metal film . from eq .",
    "( [ eqnemod_1 ] ) , one has that for weak - coupling between the two films , @xmath74 . moreover , if , as in the system experimentally studied in @xcite , the dispersion relation is the same in both the normal - metal and the superconducting film ( since the normal - metal film is composed of the same material as that of the superconducting one , but weakly doped with another metal ) , we have from eq .",
    "( [ eqnemod_2 ] ) that @xmath75 .",
    "assuming that both the order parameter @xmath39 and @xmath76 only depend on @xmath77 through their dependence on @xmath78 and are only non - zero in a vicinity of width @xmath79 around the fermi level of the material composing the films , where @xmath41 is the debye frequency of the said material , one can transform the above summation into an integral and write the above equation as @xmath80 where we have introduced @xmath81 , the density of states per atom ( and per spin - species ) in the normal metal film .",
    "differentiating eq .",
    "( [ charfas ] ) twice with respect to @xmath82 , at @xmath71 , one obtains the mean - square deviation and thus the relative deviation @xmath83 of the work performed by the nis junction during the protocol .",
    "if one transforms such result into an integral using the same assumptions we have used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eqavw2 ] ) , this integral can also be computed numerically . in a similar fashion",
    ", higher moments can be calculated .",
    "the full characterisation of the work fluctuations requires the determination of the work probability distribution , through the computation of the inverse fourier transform of @xmath25 . writing the probability distribution in terms of the logarithm of the characteristic function , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ charfas ] ) , one has @xmath84 since @xmath85 is an extensive quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ it is proportional to @xmath86 , the integral can be computed using a saddle - point approximation .",
    "minimising the argument of the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eqpww ] ) , one obtains the following saddle - point equation @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the work per atom of the sample and @xmath89 is given by @xmath90}{\\cosh\\left[\\,\\beta\\sqrt{|\\delta^n(\\xi)|^2+\\xi^2}\\,\\right ] } \\right\\}\\ , , \\label{eqs}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 .",
    "note that the solutions , @xmath92 , of the saddle - point equation ( [ eqsadd ] ) correspond to the analytic continuation of the exponent of the integral given in eq .",
    "( [ eqpww ] ) to imaginary values of @xmath93 . numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eqsadd ] ) for a set of values of @xmath94 ( with the same assumptions as in the two calculations previously performed ) and substituting its solution in eq .",
    "( [ eqpww ] ) , one obtains the result plotted in figure [ fig:3 ] for the logarithm of @xmath0 , divided by @xmath73 .",
    "this calculation indicates that the work probability distribution is a stretched exponential for both positive and negative @xmath85 . in the inset ,",
    "the exponent associated with such a stretched exponential is determined for positive @xmath85 ( blue triangles ) .",
    "we have also subtracted the factor @xmath95 from the logarithm of the probability distribution at negative @xmath85 ( green squares in the inset ) and the function so obtained coincides with the logarithm of the probability distribution for positive @xmath85 , thus showing that the distribution obeys the crooks - tasaki relation at the level of the numerics .",
    "o@xmath96/al junction at @xmath97.,width=453 ]    the above figure is a clear indication of the non - gaussian nature of the work distribution , which may allow the reconstruction of the distribution above from experimental data , using the method that we propose in [ appim ] .",
    "our primary motivation for the present study was the analysis of the validity of the crooks - tasaki relation in an experimentally relevant setting .",
    "as discussed above and in [ appim ] , this can be accomplished by measuring the heat released in the nis junction during a full cycle of the protocol . since such measurements require a high degree of control of the energy flows occurring in an experimental set - up , it is advantageous that the released heat scales with the contact area between the superconducting and normal metal films .",
    "we now consider the computation of the dissipated work released as heat by the nis junction . as a concrete example",
    ", we will consider the junction studied in reference @xcite , where manganese doped aluminium ( the mn concentration being 0.4% in mass ) acts as the normal - metal electrode in the junction and pure aluminium acts as the superconducting electrode ( with aluminium - oxide being the insulating material ) .    in aluminium ,",
    "the density of states is approximately constant in the vicinity of the fermi surface yielding @xmath98 per atom ( and per spin ) @xcite , in units of the debye frequency , which is approximately @xmath99 in aluminium .",
    "this metal is a bcs superconductor with a transition temperature , @xmath100 @xcite , and the gap - function given by @xmath101 , where one uses the universal ( bcs ) relation @xcite , valid in the weak - coupling limit . for an intermediate coupling superconductor",
    "the gap is larger than predicted by the bcs relation .",
    "this is of no concern here , since we assumed @xmath102 .    for concreteness",
    ", we consider the example of a protocol of duration @xmath103 with an applied voltage @xmath104 at a temperature of @xmath105 . performing the integral in ( [ eqavw2 ] ) , assuming a typical tunnelling element @xmath106",
    ", we obtain an average work @xmath107 per atom which amounts to approximately @xmath108 of dissipated work per gram of aluminium . for these parameters ,",
    "we also obtain a standard deviation of @xmath109 corresponding to a relative deviation , @xmath110 , which is a large value for such a quantity .",
    "the measurement of the released heat can be performed using several techniques , of which the measurement of the volume change of the film in isothermal conditions seems to be the most promising one , see [ appim ] for a detailed discussion .",
    "a word is due with respect to the approximation that the dynamics is unitary during the application of the protocol , i.e. that no heat is exchanged with the thermal bath in the time interval @xmath111 $ ] , occurring only at later stages .",
    "the exchange of energy between the electronic degrees of freedom and the heat bath occurs mainly through electron - phonon inelastic collisions .",
    "the dependence of resistivity on temperature due to electron - phonon collisions is given , in metals , by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is a temperature of the order of the debye temperature , which is @xmath114 in aluminium @xcite .",
    "using the value @xmath115 , with @xmath116 @xcite for aluminium , and assuming a drude like dependence of the resistivity on the electron - phonon relaxation time @xmath117 , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the electron effective mass in aluminium @xcite and @xmath120 is the electronic density in aluminium , we obtain @xmath121 , which is much larger than the protocol duration @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the said approximation is fully justified . moreover , such relaxation time is of the order of the equilibration time that is necessary to wait after the end of the protocol before the volume deviation discussed in [ appim ] can be measured .",
    "fluctuation - dissipation relations play a central role in thermodynamics and the approach to equilibrium , but the direct experimental verification of the various relations can often be difficult . in this work , we discussed a simple but realistic experimental set - up that will allow to test the crooks - tasaki fluctuation relation .",
    "our proposal consists of an nis junction of a superconductor and a normal metal where the bias voltage is altered according to a specified protocol , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]-(b ) .    as shown , the released heat scales with the contact area between the superconducting and normal metal films .",
    "our proposal is thus amenable to experimental verification , e.g. by coupling the junction to a probe that isothermally absorbs the released heat and changes its volume as a result .",
    "order of magnitude estimates of this effect for the aluminium - based junctions of ref .",
    "@xcite were presented in[appim ] .",
    "the calculation of the full work distribution function and its first moments clearly establishes an exponential behavior of such quantity that displays a non - gaussian character with a non - standard decay exponent .",
    "our results are based on an equivalence between the dynamics of a nis junction and the dynamics of an assembly of two - level systems subjected to a circularly polarized field .",
    "this equivalence holds in a particular adiabatic limit in which the switching - on / off of the potential difference across the junction takes place in time scales much larger than the microscopic time scale of the system , determined by the value of the superconducting gap .    [ secconc ]",
