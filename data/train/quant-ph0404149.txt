    "an interesting issue in cosmology is the evolution of metastable states in the early universe according to the original version and its variants of the inflationary models @xcite . in these models inflation of the early universe",
    "is governed by a higgs field trapped in a metastable state .",
    "inflation ends when the metastable state decays to the true ground state of the universe . during inflation",
    "the universe expands exponentially .",
    "it is thus obvious that the metastable state of the higgs field is trapped in a rapidly varying potential .",
    "the problem is therefore a truly time - dependent one .",
    "however , owing to the inherent difficulties of the problem , more often than not one considers the decay of the higgs field in a quasi - stationary approximation , in which the decay is studied assuming a static potential @xcite . surely this approximation is hard to justify , but for the present one has to be content with it .",
    "ultimately one hopes to be able to tackle the non - stationary case . to this end , it is desirable to gain some insights first by studying metastability in time - dependent potential in simple quantum - mechanical models .    roughly speaking , time - dependent potentials can be divided into three classes . in the first class",
    "we have potentials with time - dependent strength .",
    "when the strength is small , the schrdinger equation can be solved by time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "almost all textbook examples belong to this type . when the strength of the potential is not small , other methods of solution must be sought .",
    "for example , solutions of time - dependent harmonic oscillator @xcite and time - dependent linear potential @xcite can be obtained by the method of invariant .",
    "we note here that the interesting phenomenon of quantum tunneling induced by an externally driven field has also been examined experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the second class of potentials involves time - dependent boundaries . unlike the first class ,",
    "this class of potentials attracts much less attention , and almost all previous works in this area concerned only the simplest of all cases , namely , an infinite potential well with a moving wall @xcite .",
    "the last class is the combination of the previous two classes .",
    "we believe that the barrier potential in an inflationary universe is non - stationary , not only the barrier height but also the barrier width should be changing as time elapses",
    ". however , it will be extremely difficult to study metasbility in such a time - dependent potential in full generality",
    ". thus it would be helpful if the quantum tunneling effect could be studied in any class of moving potential , special though it is , as a step to understanding the decay of a non - stationary metastable system .    in this paper",
    "we consider quantum metastability in a class of scaling potentials which allows one to apply techniques used in the corresponding problem with stationary potentials .",
    "this class of potentials was introduced by berry and klein @xcite .",
    "potentials in this class have their heights and widths scaled in a specific way so that one can transform the potential into a stationary one .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "we give a general discussion of the solutions of the schrdinger equation with the scaling form of time - dependent potential introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the most suitable technique for studying quantum metastability in such kind of potential is the less known method of scattering states .",
    "two simple examples of such metastable systems , a moving delta - potential and a moving square barrier , are investigated in sect .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "generalization to arbitrary barrier is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "iv . concludes the paper .",
    "we shall consider the problem of quantum metastability of a particle of mass @xmath0 trapped in a moving potential @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath1 is of the scaling form proposed by berry and klein @xcite , namely , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a time - dependent scaling factor .",
    "the schrdinger equation is @xmath4   \\psi(x , t)~. \\label{eqs-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so far solution of eq.([eqs-1 ] ) is restricted mostly to the special case in which @xmath5 has the functional form of an infinite potential well , i.e. @xmath1 is an infinite well with a moving wall @xcite . in this case",
    "the scaling factor @xmath6 in front of @xmath5 is immaterial .    for our purpose",
    ", we shall assume @xmath5 to have the generic shape of a potential well which is impenetrable to the left and has a finite barrier to the right , much like that usually employed in the discussion of alpha - decay .",
    "we further assume @xmath3 to be a linear function of time : @xmath7 of course , for @xmath8 , the problem is meaningful only for time duration @xmath9 .",
    "eq.([eqs-1 ] ) can not be solved by separating the time and spatial coordinates . however , for the scaling form of @xmath1 in eq.([eqs-1 ] ) and the linear form of @xmath3 , separation of variables can be achieved through a series of transformations introduced in @xcite ( see also:@xcite ) .",
    "one first transforms the coordinate frame into a rescaled frame with a rescaled coordinate @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 in this frame the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath12 \\psi(\\bar{x},t)\\ . \\label{eqs-4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eqs-4 ] ) can be further simplified by the following transformation @xmath13 and the introduction of a new time variable @xmath14 @xmath15 after substituting eq.([eqs-5 ] ) and ( [ eqs-6 ] ) into ( [ eqs-4 ] ) , we obtain the equation @xmath16 which resembles the schrdinger equation with a stationary potential .",
    "eq.([eqs-7 ] ) can be solved by separation of variables @xmath17 where @xmath18 satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath19 \\phi_{k}(\\bar{x } )   = \\bar{e}_{k}\\phi_{k}(\\bar{x})\\ . \\label{eqs-9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once eq.([eqs-9 ] ) is solved exactly in the rescaled frame , the exact wave function in the original frame is then given by @xmath20 the set of solutions ( [ eqs-10 ] ) is complete and orthonormal @xmath21 so using this set of solutions we can find a solution satisfying any initial condition .",
    "furthermore , if an initial state @xmath22 is expressible in the basis @xmath23 as @xmath24 then at a later time @xmath25 the state is @xmath26    we have now succeeded in transforming the original time - dependent schrdinger equation into a time - independent one . the problem of calculating the decay probability of a particle confined in @xmath1 at time @xmath25 is reduced to the corresponding problem with a static potential @xmath27 .",
    "hence techniques used in the time - independent potential for calculating decay rate can be borrowed .",
    "however , there are some subtleties .",
    "naively , one is tempted to employ the most well - known method , namely , the complex eigenvalue method , proposed by gamow in his studies of the alpha - decay @xcite . in this approach an  outgoing wave boundary condition \" is imposed on the solutions of the schrdinger equation for the particle trapped in the well .",
    "that means incoming plane wave solutions outside the potential well are discarded right from the beginning .",
    "this procedure naturally leads to an eigenvalue problem with complex energy eigenvalues .",
    "one then relates the imaginary parts of the energy to the decay rate . while the complex eigenvalue method is straightforward and physically reasonable , it suffers from some conceptual difficulties @xcite .",
    "for example , how can energy eigenvalues be complex as we are dealing with a hermitian hamiltonian ?",
    "also , the eigenfunctions are not normalizable , a difficulty directly related to the eigenvalues being complex .",
    "furthermore , the particle trapped in the well can not be in an eigenstate of the system in the first place , since such states are not completely confined at @xmath28 .",
    "apart from the difficulties mentioned above , the complex eigenvalue method can not be employed in our problem for other reasons .",
    "first , the problem we are interested in is an intrinsically time - dependent one , with a non - conservative hamiltonian .",
    "hence energy eigenvalues and eigenstates lose their meanings altogether ( @xmath29 in eq.([eqs-9 ] ) is not an energy eigenvalue ) .",
    "second , the  outgoing wave boundary condition \" , essential to gamow s method , can not be imposed in our case .",
    "the reason is as follows . as we discussed before , in order to fix a moving potential we need to transform our problem to a corresponding static one in a rescaled frame .",
    "but in this frame the meaning of incoming or outgoing plane wave is rather obscure .",
    "in fact , it can be checked that an outgoing plane wave in the original @xmath30-@xmath25 ( rescaled @xmath10-@xmath14 ) frame contains both  incoming \" and  outgoing \" components in the rescaled @xmath10-@xmath14 ( original @xmath30-@xmath25 ) frame .",
    "instanton method is another technique commonly used in the calculation of the decay rate of a metastable state @xcite .",
    "this semiclassical method amounts essentially to finding the imaginary part of the ground state energy of the system .",
    "again , it is not suitable for our case for the same first reason given above for the failure of the complex eigenvalue method",
    ".    now that the two most common methods fail to suit our purpose , we have to look for alternatives .",
    "fortunately , a different method exists , namely , the scattering state method ( or virtual level method , as fermi called it ) @xcite .",
    "this method is much less well known and seldom used in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , it is conceptually the most satisfying one of all the methods . in this method",
    ", one first constructs the initial confining state , which is not viewed as an eigenstate , as a linear superposition of scattering states with real energies , and follows its evolution in time . in the course of this evolution , no energy will become complex .",
    "unlike the gamow states , the scattering states contain both incoming and outgoing components in the region into which the particle escapes .",
    "it is this feature of the method that makes it most suitable for our present problem .",
    "the method is easily adapted to eq.([eqs-7 ] ) by taking the scattering states as the states ( [ eqs-8 ] ) with real values of @xmath29 .    in the following two sections ,",
    "we apply the scattering state method to two simple examples of the class of scaling potentials discussed in this section . as the scattering state method",
    "is not so well known in the literature , we think it appropriate to give some details in order to make our paper self - contained .",
    "we shall follows the procedures given in @xcite which are slightly adapted to our needs .",
    "our first example is a uniformly moving delta - function potential @xmath31 where @xmath32 gives the location of the delta - potential .",
    "this is of the class of potentials defined in the last section and corresponds in the rescaled frame to @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we must have @xmath36 in the region @xmath34 . in the region",
    "@xmath37 , eq.([eqs-9 ] ) is @xmath38 its general solutions are @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a real constant , and @xmath42 a phase angle .",
    "note that we have chosen the wave function to be real , and included incoming wave component in the region @xmath43 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath44 , and hence @xmath29 , is always real . the wave function and its first derivative",
    "satisfy the following boundary conditions at @xmath45 : @xmath46 and @xmath47 > from these relations the coefficient @xmath41 can be determined as a function of @xmath48 , @xmath49 physically , the value of @xmath50 can be interpreted as the ratio of the probability of finding particles in the region @xmath43 to the probability within the confined region @xmath51 for a particular @xmath48 .",
    "the general shape of @xmath52 is shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "from which we can assert that the particle can be trapped within the confined region only when @xmath53 assumes one of its minima , which occur only in the neighborhood of some specific values of @xmath48 . in these regions",
