    "the potential energy @xmath4 is related to the time - independent force field the particle is in , while @xmath5 represents a time and position dependent driving force which will be relevant to our problem .",
    "specifically , we will consider a force which emanates from sinusoidally varying boundary effects , propagating with a constant velocity into the interval of interest , so that the space dependence of the force is also sinusoidal .    considerable amount of work has been carried out on the behaviour of @xmath6 , under the effect of various types of potentials .",
    "analytical solutions are usually restricted to simpler forms of potentials .",
    "the equation may be treated as a schrdinger equation with imaginary time , and the time dependent solutions have a relaxational type of behaviour .",
    "this is the consequence of the assumption of absence of any inertia ( or `` memory '' ) in the system : the time rate of change of @xmath6 is described in terms of the value of @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "however , we find  resonance \" behavior , in a looser context , as a consequence of eqn .",
    "[ fp ] , which corresponds to amplified response at a sequence of frequencies , based on matching of the waveform of the driving force to the interval between the boundaries .",
    "a number of other stochastic systems with damped dynamics do display non - monotonous frequency response to sinusoidal drives . in brownian motors ,",
    "the particle moves in a ( usually ratchet - type ) static potential and the sinusoidal force is used to drive the particle over the  easier \" barrier @xcite .",
    "( the asymmetry in the direction may be achieved either by the form of the static potential or the form of the time - dependent forces . ) alternatively , a high - frequency drive may effectively act to average over portions the static potential , on a length scale which depends on the properties of the drive .",
    "this results in a ",
    "vibrational resonance \" @xcite with transport properties strongly dependent on parameters associated with the drive .",
    "the force may take the form of a superposition of a number of sinusoidal ( or rectangular ) functions , in which case the non - linear effects may lead to interesting effects at certain combination of frequencies @xcite . besides the models we mention here , the reader is referred to a review by hnggi and marchesoni @xcite for a detailed discussion of these and other similar systems .",
    "sinusoidal drive on a damped system has also been studied in relation to  stochastic resonance \" @xcite .",
    "this relates basically to the motion of a damped particle in a double well potential on which a random diffusive force as well as the sinusoidal force is acting .",
    "it had been demonstrated that there would be an optimal magnitude for the random force which amplifies transitions between the potential minima in synchronism with the periodic drive .",
    "jung and hnggi @xcite solved the corresponding fp equation , demonstrating that the time autocorrelation function of a periodically driven bistable over - damped system sustains undamped oscillations .",
    "the term `` resonance '' here is associated with amplified response at a certain value of the magnitude of the random force .",
    "the process has been used to model a very wide spectrum of phenomena , ranging for example from the effect of seasonal changes on population systems @xcite to the dependence of stock prices on periodic information flow @xcite , as well as a multitude of biological phenomena@xcite .",
    "all of the above processes incorporate time - independent multiple potential wells and position independent periodic forces .",
    "in contrast to , the phenomena we report is associated with a static potential confined to the boundaries and a periodic retarded force also emanates from the boundaries .",
    "the effects of a force field propagating with a finite velocity ( which in our case is equivalent to a position dependent time - periodic force ) has not received much attention .",
    "relevant work include the analysis of a diffusive system which injects particles ( which are annihilated upon contact with one another ) at a boundary @xcite , and the derivation of an effective force in a hamiltonian system with a position - dependent sinusoidal force coupled to a bath of oscillators ( resulting in the random force ) @xcite .",
    "it may seem contradictory to discuss the presence of propagating effects within the context of a memoryless , over - damped system .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism which drives the diffusion dynamics can be distinct from the process which generates the effective force .",
    "this is the case , for example , in totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) systems where the diffusion of a persistent shock front in the system @xcite is influenced by the boundary conditions after a delay .",
    "thus , tasep forms a discrete realization of the aforementioned fp system .",

    "in particular , we take the time - independent potential @xmath8 to be given by @xmath9 the quadratic structure softens the boundaries at @xmath10 with a range related to @xmath11 .",
    "we also assume that a time dependent force acts on the particle , synchronously from the two boundaries , but retarded in time ( with a propagation speed @xmath12 ) in proportion to the distance to the boundaries : @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\                & & +   f_0 \\sin \\left [ \\omega\\left ( t-\\frac{l/2-x}{v}\\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & = & 2f_0 \\cos \\frac{\\omega x}{v } \\sin \\left [ \\omega\\left ( t-\\frac{l}{2v}\\right ) \\right ] . \\label{force}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be observed that the retarded force results in a position dependent amplitude in the oscillation .",
    "this amplitude is not frequency dependent , however we will show that the magnitude of the response to this force does depend on how the wavelength compares to the size of the system .",
    "we write eqn .",
