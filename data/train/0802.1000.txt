    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the electroweak symmetry is broken via the higgs mechanism , leading to five physical scalars : three neutral ( h , h , a ) and two charged ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 ) higgs bosons . at tree level , two parameters , usually chosen to be the mass of the pseudo scalar higgs boson ( @xmath2 ) and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs fields ( @xmath3 ) , determine the masses and couplings in the higgs sector .",
    "radiative corrections , chiefly coming from the top - stop and , at large @xmath3 , from the bottom - sbottom sector , introduce further model parameters .    in the frequently studied decoupling limit ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the lightest neutral higgs boson is standard model - like , while h and a are close in mass and both couple with @xmath3 to down - type fermions and with @xmath5 to up - type fermions .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for heavy neutral mssm higgs bosons at large @xmath3 is gg @xmath6 bbh / a with negligible contributions from other processes .",
    "as the main decay mode h / a @xmath6 bb suffers from high qcd background , the decay h / a @xmath6 @xmath7 , reaching about 10% rate for @xmath810 , promises the most sensitivity .",
    "charged higgs bosons couple to fermions as h@xmath0ud @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "they are produced in top quark decay , if @xmath11 , or in association with a top quark , if @xmath12 .",
    "light charged higgs bosons decay almost exclusively to a tau lepton and a neutrino for @xmath13 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the decay h@xmath15 @xmath6 tb dominates with an important contribution of h@xmath15 @xmath6 @xmath16 at large @xmath3 .",
    "the following processes are considered here :    * associated bbh / a production followed by h / a @xmath6 @xmath7 with all possible @xmath7 final states ( jet jet , e jet , @xmath17 jet and e @xmath17 )  @xcite ; * production of a light charged higgs boson in tt @xmath6 h@xmath15bwb with subsequent h@xmath15 @xmath6 @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath6 jet and w @xmath6 @xmath20 decays  @xcite ; * associated h@xmath15t(b ) production of heavy charged higgs boson with h@xmath15 @xmath6 @xmath21 , @xmath19 @xmath6 jet and hadronic top quark decays  @xcite ; * associated h@xmath15t(b ) production of heavy charged higgs boson with h@xmath15 @xmath6 tb and one of the top quarks decaying leptonically  @xcite .",
    "the final states in the search for heavy mssm higgs bosons are complex : they typically contain leptons , b- and light - flavoured hadronic jets and missing transverse energy .",
    "the selections rely on @xmath19-jet or lepton ( e , @xmath17 ) triggers .",
    "@xmath19-identification based on vertex reconstruction and impact parameter measurements is powerful against hadronic jets .",
    "a single b - tag is sufficient to suppress events from drell - yan , qcd multi - jet and w+jets processes . against the difficult tt",
    "background a central jet veto is applied .",
    "missing transverse energy ( @xmath22 ) reconstruction is important to account for the neutrinos from the higgs or the @xmath19 decays .",
    "top quark and w boson mass reconstruction provides a further handle on the background .",
    "for example , in the bbh / a , h / a @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath23 + jet searches , it is instrumental in vetoing leptons from w decay by reconstructing the transverse mass of the [ lepton , @xmath22 ] system .",
    "the main background comes from tt events , with significant contribution from w+jets events in the h@xmath15 @xmath6 @xmath21 searches and drell - yan processes in the h / a @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath23 + jet searches .",
    "a major exception is the h / a @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 jet jet analysis , where qcd events dominate the background . the typical selection efficiency is below 1% .",
    "_ higgs boson mass reconstruction _ does not only increases the sensitivity of the searches , but it will also play a crucial role in constraining the mssm model parameters .    in the h / a @xmath6 @xmath7 selection",
    "the higgs mass can be measured by the di - tau mass assuming that the @xmath19 decay products are collinearly emitted .",
    "while the procedure has large inefficiency , it achieves a mass resolution of about 20% .    in the heavy",
    "charged higgs search : h@xmath15 t @xmath6 @xmath21 bqq , the reconstruction of the top quark mass is instrumental in fully reconstructing the signal .",
    "the charged higgs mass is then estimated by the transverse mass of the [ @xmath19 , @xmath22 ] system ( @xmath25 ) . by requiring @xmath26100  gev ,",
    "an almost background - free selection is achieved .",
    "the results presented here are based on the full simulation of the cms detector at low luminosity ( @xmath27  @xmath28s@xmath29 ) , assuming a total integrated luminosity of 30@xmath3060 fb@xmath29 .",
    "pythia is used as the main monte carlo generator with notable exceptions ( e.g. matrix element generators for multi - parton or toprex for tt final states in some cases ) .",
