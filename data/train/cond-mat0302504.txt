    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath3-electron systems ( with a small finite @xmath3 ) in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath4 ) have been the focus of extensive theoretical investigations in the last twenty years.@xcite the principal motivations for these research activities are : ( i ) the early realization @xcite that certain special states of few electron systems are relevant@xcite through appropriate analogies to the physics of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , observed in the infinite 2d electron gas ; ( ii ) the unavoidable necessity , due to computer limitations , to test proposed model wave functions for the fqhe through numerical calculations for finite - size systems ; ( iii ) the recent progress in nanofabrication techniques at semiconductor interfaces that has allowed experiments on 2d quantum dots ( qd s ) , with refined control of their size , shape , and number of electrons@xcite ( down to a few electrons ) .",
    "the physics of such systems ( i.e. , qd s in high @xmath4 ) , is most often described with the use of composite - fermion@xcite / jastrow - laughlin@xcite ( cf / jl ) analytic trial wave functions in the complex plane .",
    "however , it is well known that the thematic framework of the cf / jl approach is built on the so - called jastrow correlations associated with a particular short - range interparticle repulsion.@xcite in a recent paper,@xcite using as a thematic basis the picture of collectively rotating electron ( or wigner ) molecules ( rem s ) , we have derived a different class of analytic and parameter - free trial wave functions . the promising property of these rem wave functions is that , unlike the cf / jl ones , they capture the all - important correlations arising from the long - range character of the coulomb force .    in this paper , we present an in - depth assessment of the cf / jl and rem trial wave functions regarding their ability to approximate the exact wave functions in the case of qd s ( this case is often referred to as the `` disk geometry '' in the fqhe literature ) .",
    "first systematic exact diagonalization ( exd ) results are reported here for the lowest rotational band of @xmath0 electrons in strong magnetic fields in the range of high angular momenta @xmath1 ( covering the corresponding range of fractional filling factors@xcite @xmath2 ) . a detailed comparison",
    "( addressing five properties , i.e. , prediction of magic angular momenta , radial electron densities , occupation number distributions , overlaps and total energies , and exponents of current - voltage power law ) shows that the rem wave functions yield a superior description to that obtained through the composite - fermion / jastrow - laughlin ones .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : section ii presents an outline of the rem theory , while section iii focuses on a brief review of the composite - fermion approach .",
    "exact - diagonalization results and comparisons with the cf / jl and rem wave functions are presented in section iv .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section v.",
    "in the last eight years , and in particular since 1999 [ when it was demonstrated@xcite that wigner crystallization is related to symmetry breaking at the _ unrestricted _ hartree - fock ( uhf ) mean - field level ] , the number of publications@xmath5 addressing the formation and properties of wigner ( or electron ) molecules in 2d qd s and quantum dot molecules has grown steadily .",
    "a consensus has been reached that rotating electron molecules are formed both in zero @xcite and high@xcite magnetic fields .    at @xmath6 ,",
    "formation of rem s in qd s is analogous to wigner crystallization in infinite 2d media , i.e. , when the strength of the interelectron repulsion relative to the zero - point kinetic energy ( @xmath7 ) exceeds a certain critical value , electrons spontaneously crystallize around sites forming geometric molecular structures . at high magnetic fields",
    ", the formation of wigner molecules may be thought of as involving a two - step crystallization process : ( i ) the localization of electrons results from the shrinkage of the orbitals due to the increasing strength of the magnetic field ; ( ii ) then , even a weak interelectron coulomb repulsion is able to arrange the localized electrons according to geometric molecular structures ( thus this process is independent of the value of @xmath7 ) .",
    "it has been found@xcite that the molecular structures at high @xmath4 coincide with the equilibrium configurations at @xmath6 of @xmath3 classical point charges.@xcite    due to the finite number , @xmath3 , of electrons , however , there are two crucial differences between the rem and the bulk wigner crystal .",
    "namely , ( i ) the crystalline structure is that of the equilibrium 2d configuration of @xmath3 classical point charges , and thus consists of nested polygonal rings ; @xcite ( ii ) the wigner molecules rotate as a whole ( collective rotations ) in analogy with the case of 3d natural molecules .",
    "a most striking observation concerning the rem s is that their formation and properties have been established with the help of traditional _ ab initio _ many - body methods , i.e. , exact diagonalization , @xcite quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) , and the systematic controlled hierarchy@xcite of approximations involving the uhf and subsequent post - hartree - fock methods .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the cf / jl wave functions , which were inspired through `` intuition - based guesswork '' .    in spite of its firm foundation in many - body theory ,",
    "however , the rem picture has not , until recently , successfully competed with the cf / jl picture ; indeed many research papers@xcite and books@xcite describe the physics of qd s in high magnetic fields following exclusively notions based on cf / jl functions , as expounded in 1983 ( see ref .   ) and developed in detail in 1995 in ref .   and ref .",
    "we believe that one of the main obstacles for more frequent use of the rem picture has been the lack of analytic correlated wave functions associated with this picture .",
    "this situation , however , has changed with the recent explicit derivation of such rem wave functions . @xcite    the approach used in ref .   for constructing the rem functions in high @xmath4",
    "consists of two - steps : first the breaking of the rotational symmetry at the level of the single - determinantal unrestricted hartree - fock approximation yields states representing electron molecules ( or finite crystallites , also referred to as wigner molecules , see ref .   and ref .",
    "subsequently the rotation of the electron molecule is described through restoration of the circular symmetry via post hartree - fock methods , and in particular projection techniques.@xcite naturally , the restoration of symmetry goes beyond the single determinantal mean - field description and yields multi - determinantal wave functions . for qd s",
    ", we have shown that the method of symmetry restoration is applicable to both the zero@xcite and high@xcite magnetic - field cases .",
    "in the zero and low - field cases , the broken symmetry uhf orbitals need to be determined numerically , and , in addition , the restoration of the total - spin symmetry needs to be considered for unpolarized and partially polarized cases . the formalism and mathematical details of this procedure at @xmath6",
    "have been elaborated in ref .",
    "( see also ref .   and ref .  ) for the restoration of the total spin in the case of quantum dot molecules ) .    in the case of high magnetic fields , one can specifically consider the limit when the confining potential can be neglected compared to the confinement induced by the magnetic field . then , assuming a symmetric gauge , the uhf orbitals can be represented @xcite by displaced gaussian analytic functions , centered at different positions @xmath8 according to the equilibrium configuration of @xmath3 classical point charges@xcite arranged at the vertices of nested regular polygons ( each gaussian representing a localized electron ) .",
    "such displaced gaussians are written as ( here and in the following @xmath9 ) @xmath10 \\exp[-\\imath ( xy_j - yx_j ) ] , \\label{gaus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the phase factor is due to the gauge invariance .",
    "@xmath11 ( see ref .  ) , and all lengths are in dimensionless units of @xmath12 with the magnetic length being @xmath13 .    in ref .  , we used these analytic orbitals to first construct the broken symmetry uhf determinant , @xmath14 , and then proceeded to derive analytic expressions for the many - body rem wave functions by applying onto @xmath14 an appropriate projection operator@xcite @xmath15 that restores the circular symmetry and generates _",
    "correlated_@xcite wave functions with good total angular momentum @xmath16 .",
    "these rem wave functions can be easily written down@xcite in second - quantized form for any classical polygonal ring arrangement @xmath17 by following certain simple rules for determining the coefficients of the determinants @xmath18 $ ] , where the @xmath19 s denote the angular momenta of the individual electrons .",
    "since we will focus here on the case of @xmath0 and @xmath20 electrons , we list for completeness the rem functions associated with the @xmath21 and @xmath22 ring arrangements , respectively [ here @xmath21 denotes a regular polygon with @xmath3 vertices , such as an equilateral triangle or a regular hexagon , and @xmath22 is a regular polygon with @xmath23 vertices and one occupied site in its center ] , @xmath24 \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ ; d(l_1,l_2, ... ,l_n ) \\exp(-\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i z_i^*/2 ) , \\label{phi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ ; d(0,l_2, ... ,l_n ) \\exp(-\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i z_i^*/2 ) , \\label{phi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the minimum allowed total angular momentum for @xmath3 ( polarized ) electrons in high magnetic fields .",
    "notice that the rem wave functions [ eq .  ( [ phi1 ] ) and eq ,  ( [ phi2 ] ) ] vanish identically for values of the total angular momenta outside the specific values given by eq .",
    "( [ lwm0n ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lwm1nm1 ] ) , respectively .",
    "according to the cf picture,@xcite the many body wave functions in high magnetic fields that describe @xmath3-electrons in the disc geometry ( case of 2d qd s ) are given by the expression , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the slater determinant of @xmath3 _ non - interacting _ electrons of total angular momentum @xmath32 ; it is constructed according to the independent particle model ( ipm ) from the darwin - fock@xcite orbitals @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the number of nodes and the angular momentum , respectively [ for the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the @xmath36th landau level in high @xmath4 , see the paragraph following equation ( [ ltol * ] ) below ] .    the jastrow factor in front of @xmath31",
    "is introduced to represent the effect of the interelectron coulombic interaction . in the cf literature , this assumption is often described by saying that `` the jastrow factor binds @xmath37 vortices to each electron of @xmath31 to convert it into a composite fermion '' .    the single - particle electronic orbitals in the slater determinant @xmath31 are not restricted to the lowest landau level ( lll ) . as a result , it is necessary to apply a projection operator @xmath38 to guarantee that the cf wave function lies in the lll , as appropriate for @xmath39 .    since the cf wave function is an homogeneous polynomial in the electronic positions @xmath40 s , its angular momentum @xmath16 is related to the non - interacting total angular momentum @xmath32",
    "as follows , @xmath41    there is no reason to _ a priori _ restrict the slater determinants @xmath31 to a certain form , but according to ref .",
    ", such a restriction is absolutely necessary in order to derive systematic results . thus following ref .",
    ", henceforth , we will restrict the non - interacting @xmath32 to the range @xmath42 , and we will assume that the slater determinants @xmath31 are the so - called compact ones .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the number of electrons in the @xmath36th landau level ( ll ) with @xmath44 ; @xmath45 is the index of the highest occupied ll and all the lower ll s with @xmath46 are assumed to be occupied .",
    "the compact determinants are defined as those in which the @xmath43 electrons occupy contiguously the single - particle orbitals ( of each @xmath36th ll ) with the lowest angular momenta , @xmath47 @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the compact slater determinants are usually denoted as @xmath49 $ ] , and the corresponding total angular momenta are given by @xmath50 .",
    "most important for our present study is the fact that the jastrow - laughlin wave functions with angular momentum @xmath51 [ corresponding to fractional filling factors @xmath52 , @xmath53 are a special case of the cf functions for @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 note that for @xmath54 , all the non - interacting electrons occupy contiguous states in the lll ( @xmath56 ) with @xmath57 .",
    "the cf / jl wave functions [ equations ( [ cfeqs ] ) and ( [ jlwfs ] ) ] are represented by compact , one - line mathematical expressions , which however are not the most convenient for carrying out numerical calculations . numerical studies of the cf / jl functions usually employ sophisticated monte carlo computational techniques .",
    "the rem wave functions , on the other hand , are by construction expressed in second - quantized ( superposition of slater determinants ) form , precisely like the wave functions from exact diagonalization , a fact that greatly simplifies the numerical work . in the numerical calculations involving jl wave functions in this paper , we have circumvented the need to use monte carlo techniques , since we were able to determine the slater decomposition@xcite of the jl states with the help of the symbolic language mathematica.@xcite    we stress again that , unlike the rem functions , the cf / jl wave functions have not been derived microscopically , i.e. , from the many - body schrdinger equation with interelectron coulombic repulsions .",
    "attempts have been made to justify them _ a posteriori _ by pointing out that their overlaps with exact wave functions are close to unity or that their energies are close to the exact energies .",
    "however , we will show below that this agreement is limited to rather narrow ranges of filling factors between @xmath58 or to small electron numbers @xmath3 ; as soon as one extends the comparisons to a broader range of @xmath59 s for @xmath60 , as well as to other quantities like electron densitiess and occupation number distributions , this agreement markedly deteriorates .",
    "in the case of high magnetic fields , the hilbert space for exact - diagonalization calculations can be restricted to the lll and many such calculations have been reported@xcite in the past twenty years . however , for @xmath61 , such exd studies have been restricted to angular momenta corresponding to the rather narrow range of fillings factors @xmath58 .    in this paper ,",
    "we have performed systematic exd calculations in the lll for @xmath0 electrons covering the much broader range of fillings factors @xmath62 ; such a range corresponds to angular momenta @xmath63 ( note that for @xmath64 one has @xmath65 ) .",
    "of crucial importance for extending the calculations to such large @xmath16 s has been our use of tsipers@xcite analytic formula for calculating the two - body matrix elements of the coulomb interelectron repulsion ; this formula expresses the matrix elements as finite sums of positive terms .",
    "earlier analytic formulas@xcite suffered from large cancellation errors due to summations over alternating positive and negative terms . at the same time , tsiper s formula is computationally faster compared to the slowly - convergent series of ref .  .",
    "for the solution of the large scale , but sparse , coulomb eigenvalue problem , we have used the arpack computer code.@xcite for a given @xmath16 , the hilbert space is built out of slater determinants , @xmath66 with @xmath67 and its dimensions are controlled by the maximum allowed single - particle angular momentum @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "we have used @xmath71 ( see ref .   for the definition of @xmath72 ) for each group of angular momenta @xmath16 corresponding to the range @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "for example , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the dimension of the hilbert space is 56115 ; for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the size of the hilbert space is 187597 . by varying @xmath68",
    ", we have checked that this choice produces well converged numerical results .",
    "foe @xmath0 , figs .  1 - 4 display ( in four installments ) the total interaction energy from exd as a function of the total angular momentum @xmath16 in the range @xmath79 . ( the total kinetic energy , being a constant , can be disregarded . )",
    "one can immediately observe the appearance of downward cusps , implying states of enhanced stability , at certain `` magic angular momenta '' .    for the cf theory ,",
    "the magic angular momenta can be determined by eq .",
    "( [ ltol * ] ) , if one knows the non - interacting @xmath32 s ; the cf magic @xmath16 s in any interval @xmath80 @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath82 , can be found by adding @xmath83 units of angular momentum to each of the @xmath32 s . to obtain the non - interacting @xmath32 s",

    "exact diagonalization ( exd ) results for the lowest rotational band of a circular qd with @xmath0 electrons in strong magnetic fields were reported@xcite here for the first time in the range of high angular momenta @xmath1 ( covering the corresponding range of fractional filling factors @xmath2 ) .",

    "an important finding is that `` global '' quantities ( like overlaps and total energies ) are not particularly reliable indices for comparing exact and trial wave functions ; a reliable decision on the agreement , or lack of it , between exact and trial wave functions should include detailed comparisons of quantities like radial electron densities and/or occupation number distributions .",
