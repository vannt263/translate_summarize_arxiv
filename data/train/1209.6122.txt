    "an operad @xmath0 is called _ differentiable _ when it is defined on the symmetric monoidal category of differentiable manifolds .",

    "one would naturally wonder wether the operad structure induced on homology by the spectral sequence coincides with the one induced by the topological operad structure .",
    "in the present paper we study the spectral sequence of a stratified operad , given by kontsevich s compactification @xcite , which is homotopically equivalent to the swiss - cheese operad @xmath5 .",

    "the swiss - cheese operad has been carefully studied by the authors in @xcite , where the zero - th homology of the swiss - cheese operad @xmath5 were related to the first row of the spectral sequence associated to the kontsevich compactification .",
    "one of the purpose of @xcite was to prove an @xmath5 analogue of the following fact concerning the little disks operad @xmath7 :    * proposition . *",
    "_ the zero - th homology of the operad @xmath7 is koszul dual to a suspension of the top homology . _    in the case of little discs , the zero - th homology is the operad @xmath8 and the top homology is a desuspension of the operad @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the above proposition is a consequence of a theorem , proved by getzler and jones , according to which the gerstenhaber operad @xmath10 is , up to suspension , a self - dual koszul operad .",
    "we proved in @xcite that the zero - th homology of @xmath5 is a koszul quadratic - linear operad , and that its koszul dual @xmath11 , which is a dg - operad , has for homology a suspension of the top homology .",
    "note that in the context of @xmath5 , the top homology does not form an operad , so by top homology we mean the smallest operad containing the top degrees generators .",
    "the little disks operad @xmath7 is not stratified .",
    "however , by considering the real fulton - macpherson compactification of the moduli space of points in the complex plane , we get a homotopically equivalent stratified operad sometimes denoted @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the same compactification procedure can be applied to the swiss - cheese operad @xmath5 ( the homotopy equivalent stratified operad obtained is sometimes denoted @xmath13 ) .",
    "so , by passing to a homotopy equivalent operad , we can assume that both little disks and swiss - cheese operads are stratified .",
    "we note that from the cofibrancy of @xmath12 proven by salvatore @xcite , the homotopy equivalence between the above operads are compatible with the operad structure , hence the topological operad structure of @xmath7 and @xmath12 ( resp . @xmath5 and @xmath13 ) induce the same operad structure on homology .",

    "the main result of this paper says that the homology of the swiss - cheese operad is a quadratic - linear koszul operad in the sense of @xcite .",

    "we show that the spectral sequence @xmath15 of the swiss - cheese operad collapses at the second stage , proving a conjecture by a. voronov in @xcite .",
    "the relation ( modulo ( de)suspension ) between @xmath16 and the cobar construction of the cohomology cooperad @xmath17 is well known @xcite , but in our setting it is slightly different , so a proof is given in lemma [ lemma : cobar ] . finally , using that lemma and the koszul duality theory in the quadratic - linear framework , we prove that the spectral sequence given by the stratified structure of @xmath5 induces on @xmath6 an operad structure that is different from the one induced by the topological operad structure of @xmath5 , while the @xmath18-module structure is the same .",
