    "understanding how the solar corona is heated to high temperatures is one of the principal objectives of the hinode mission @xcite .",
    "the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on hinode has an unprecedented combination of high spatial , spectral , and temporal resolution and provides a wealth of information on the temperatures , densities , velocities , and nonthermal motions in the solar corona .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on hinode is one of the highest spatial resolution soft x - ray telescopes ever built , and combines this high spatial resolution with high temporal resolution and a broad temperature coverage .",
    "together , these instruments give us an unparalleled ability to probe the morphology and evolution of coronal plasma ( see , @xcite and @xcite , for more details on the instruments ) .",
    "one question of particular importance is the time scale for heating in solar active regions .",
    "recent observations have yielded contradictory results . at high temperatures , observations at soft x - ray wavelengths",
    "have suggested that the emission is relatively steady and can be described with steady heating models .",
    "the analysis of individual loops ( e.g. , @xcite ) has shown that the evolution of the intensity is generally much slower than the conductive or radiative cooling times and that the loop emission is consistent with the rtv scaling laws @xcite .",
    "transient brightenings have been observed in active regions previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but they do not appear to provide sufficient heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the application of steady heating models to entire active regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , coronal bright points @xcite , and the full sun @xcite have successfully reproduced the observed high temperature emission .",
    "( 6.4in,3.2in)warren_fig1.small.ps    at lower temperatures , observations of active regions at temperatures near 1mk suggest that coronal plasma is far from equilibrium .",
    "the analysis of coronal loops at these temperatures indicate very large densities relative to the rtv scaling laws ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "full active region modeling shows that while the steady heating models can reproduce the high temperature emission , these models can not account for the presence of cooler active region loops @xcite . because loops cool more rapidly than they drain ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", impulsive heating models can account for the bright active region loop emission observed at these temperatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "examples of active region loops cooling from high temperatures down through 1mk have been documented ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the different heating time scales suggested by the observations at different temperatures can be resolved in a number of ways .",
    "it may be that there is a different heating mechanism responsible for the plasma at different temperatures .",
    "alternatively , it may be that high temperature emission is more dynamic than previously thought and the modest spatial resolution of previous instruments has obscured this .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make an initial survey of some eis and xrt active region observations and to explore the available diagnostics .",
    "noaa active region 10940 traversed the solar disk observable from earth from january 27 to february 10 , 2007 . in this paper",
    "we consider results from specially designed eis active region observing sequences taken during the period february 16 , 2007 .",
    "the eis observations during this period generally consisted of small context rasters ( @xmath0 ) used for co - alignment with xrt that were followed by a long series of exposures at a fixed position with the 1  slit taken at a cadence of 30s . in both observing sequences",
    "20 spectral windows 24 pixels wide and 400  long were selected to be included in the telemetry stream .",
    "these eis sit - and - stare observations were typically run for periods of approximately 10 consecutive hours tracking a single position on the sun .",
    "representative images from the xrt are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the xrt observations during this time generally consisted of @xmath1 pixel cutouts at a cadence of about 60s in the al_poly / open filter combination .",
    "xrt images in the al_poly / al_thick filter combination were taken at a cadence of about 360s .",
    "full disk synoptic observations in multiple filters were taken 4 times per day .",
    "sample xrt images of this active region are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "( 5.76in,1.917in)warren_fig2a.ps    ( 5.76in,1.917in)warren_fig2b.ps    ( 5.76in,1.917in)warren_fig2c.ps    eis spectra have been processed using current standard reduction software , which consists of ccd bias and dark current subtraction and cosmic ray and hot pixel removal .",
    "pixels affected by the latter are flagged as missing and their values are replaced by the median value of the neighboring ones .",
    "spectral lines were fitted with single gaussian profiles , except for the fexiii doublet ( 203.83/203.80 ) line which is a resolved blend with the fexii 203.73  line .",
    "the fits return peak intensity , width , and center position of the line for every pixel along the slit and every exposure . since the spacecraft tracks solar rotation in the sit - and - stare observations we obtain temporal variations of three parameters for the same position on the sun .",
    "the spectral information has to be corrected of two instrumental effects : the tilt of the slit on the ccd and the sinusoidal drift of the lines on the detector due to orbital changes . further details and how to do the correction is given elsewhere ( mariska et al .",
    ", this issue ) .",
    "spatially , a north - south spacecraft drift is evident in the time slice intensity image of every line , i.e. the image that results from putting together in succession the intensity images of the slit for every exposure .",
    "this jitter is also present in the xrt movies , and can be corrected by cross - correlation of the xrt images with respect to a reference image , which was chosen to be the xrt image closest to the middle of the eis context raster .",
    "the amplitudes of these offsets , which range from 1 to 4 xrt pixels , are used in first order to correct the spacecraft drift along the slit .",
    "the correction is satisfactory for the time series we have analyzed .",
    "the co - alignment between xrt and eis was established by cross - correlating the al_poly / open image taken closest to the middle of the eis context raster in the fexvi 262.98  line . for non - flaring active region conditions",
    "the morphology of the xrt al_poly / open images is very similar to the eis fexvi 262.98  raster .    from the location of the eis slit on the co - aligned xrt datacube",
    "we extract a time slice , i.e. a solar y versus time image , that can be directly compared with the eis time slices described above .",
    "the al_poly xrt filter peak response is at around 8mk , in the upper limit range of eis temperature coverage , which makes it , apart from an excellent context image , a good complement in terms of temperature sampling .",
    "xrt movies of this active region immediately reveal the dynamic nature of the high temperature emission . a wide variety of loops of different lengths and topological connections",
    "are observed to brighten up and disappear . despite the rapid evolution of many loops within the active region ,",
    "the general morphology of the active region is relatively constant , and the total intensity appears to evolve slowly .    to make these impressions more quantitative",
    "we have calculated light curves for individual pixels in the co - aligned xrt data cubes . as illustrated by the light curves shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] ,",
    "there are numerous pixels which show intensity variations of more than 100% during the course of the observations .",
    "the accompanying xrt images show that these intensity variations are related to brightenings in individual loops .",
    "the average intensity in the active region , in contrast , is much more steady , varying by only @xmath220% during the 10 hours of observation .",
    "( 5.5in,7.7in)warren_fig3.ps    to aid in the identification of events observed with eis and xrt",
    "we have inspected stack plots of integrated line intensity as a function of time .",
    "we generally begin by identifying events the xrt data and then look for the corresponding signatures in the eis observations .",
    "we have found many examples of transient brightenings in these data .",
    "the general trend in the light curves supports the idea that these brightenings are heating events in individual loops .",
    "intensity enhancements are usually first seen in the detector sensitive to hotter temperatures , the xrt al_poly filter , and then in successively cooler emission lines : fexvi ( 2.5 mk ) , fexiv ( 2.0 mk ) , fexiii ( 1.6 mk ) , fexii and six ( 1.3 mk ) , and sivii ( 0.6 mk ) . while this is the general trend there are many instances where the evolution of the plasma is confusing , presumably because of multiple structures along the line of sight .",
    "( 6.67in,4in)warren_fig4.ps    for this initial study",
    "we focus on the brightest event that has the clearest signatures , a goes b - class flare observed on february 1 , 2007 near 15:45 ut . the stack plots and light curves from this event are shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "data from only 6 of the 20 available eis spectral windows are given .",
    "there is a clear progression in the time of the peak emission from the xrt al_poly to the eis six . at the lower temperatures the signature of the event is not as clear , suggesting some contamination from foreground and background emission .",
    "the sivii light curve is particularly difficult to understand .",
    "the emission in this line peaks very early , before an significant rise in the high temperature light curves and there is very little emission in sivii during the decay of the event .    to aid in the interpretation of these light curves we have also assembled some images of this event , which are shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] . in addition to the xrt al_poly / open and al_poly / al_thick images we show the stereo b euvi",
    "feix / x 171  images from this time @xcite .",
    "there are no trace images during the event because the spacecraft was experiencing an orbital eclipse .",
    "these images indicate how complex even a small transient event can be .",
    "the xrt images show that the emission at high temperatures does not come from a single loop but several loops .",
    "the 171  images show an intense footpoint brightening , suggesting that the spike in the sivii emission originates in one of the loop footpoints .",
    "the appearance of the loop in the xrt al_thick filter suggests that the emission reaches very high temperatures .",
    "we have found signatures of this high temperature emission in the eis spectra .",
    "the fexxiv 255.1 and 192.0  lines appear very briefly in these data , peaking at about 15:45 , coincident with the peak in the goes 18  flux . at this time fexxiii 263.76  also appears . during this event emission at fexvii 254.87 and caxvii 192.87",
    "are also observed . for this relatively weak event ,",
    "the caxvii emission is difficult to disentangle from the fexi and ov blends .",
    "( 3in,2.5in)warren_fig5.ps    the footpoint emission observed at the lower temperatures ( such as sivii ) have an interesting doppler signature .",
    "profiles near to the top of the brightening show a significant shift relative to profiles at the bottom of the brightening .",
    "this phenomenon in the sivii profile is illustrated in figure  [ fig:5 ] . here",
    "the profile @xmath3 from the center of the footpoint is blueshifted by about 30 km  s@xmath4 , but is approximately gaussian .",
    "the profile @xmath5 from the center shows only a small shift in the peak , but the profile is broadened out beyond 100 km  @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior suggestive of the bi - direction jets observed in transition region emission lines with the sumer spectrometer on soho .",
    "these bi - directional flows have been interpreted as evidence for magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "the emission observed at the higher temperatures with eis does not appear to show significant doppler signatures .",
    "the line centroids are generally within a few km  s@xmath4 of their pre - flare positions .",
    "the line widths , in contrast do show some interesting behavior during the heating event .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig:6 ] , the line widths for fexvi , fexv , and fexiv peak during the rise phase in the event . in all of the lines , the peak in the line width",
    "is achieved before the peak in the line intensity . a similar behavior",
    "is often observed in flares , where the peak non - thermal velocity typically occurs at or before the peak in intensity @xcite . in the flare case",
    "it has been conjectured that this is related to turbulent motions during the heating .",
    "since the plasma observed in these emission lines is presumably cooling , the origin of the excess width early in the event is difficult to interpret .",
    "we have presented an initial look at active region transient brightenings observed with the eis and xrt instruments on hinode .",
    "the high spatial and temporal resolution of these instruments indicate that high temperature active region emission can be highly dynamic , suggesting that impulsive heating is more important than previously thought .",
    "the fine temperature resolution of eis allows us to follow the evolution of active region plasma in great detail .",
    "we see numerous examples of plasma cooling from high temperatures to lower temperatures and have presented one example in some detail . to our knowledge",
    "this is the most complete observation of an active region transient to date .",
    "the very broad temperature coverage of eis allows us to follow the temperature evolution from above 10mk to below 0.1mk .",
    "the high spectral resolution of eis also allows us to identify possible velocity signatures of active region heating in one event .",
    "we find what appear to be bi - directional flows at the loop footpoints and excess line widths during the rise phase of the event .",
    "these results , however , are preliminary .",
    "they generally come from the analysis of a single event from a single active region .",
    "our impression is that this event is qualitatively similar to the other , smaller events that are observed in this region .",
    "many more systematic studies of active region transient activity with hinode are clearly required .    while the analysis of transient events observed with xrt and eis has the potential to yield insights into the coronal heating mechanism , it is also possible that there is a strong steady heating level that contributes to the active region heating .",
    "the light curves presented in figure  [ fig:2 ] clearly show a high basal level of several thousand dn  s@xmath4 . differentiating between steady heating with transient events superimposed and",
    "purely impulsive heating will require detailed statistical analysis and modeling of the observed light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the heating of the solar corona is undoubtedly related to the evolution of surface magnetic fields and incorporating the analysis of magnetic field data and chromospheric emission from the sot on hinode is also very important .",
    "we have surveyed the sot data from this period and we see a wealth of activity at these heights in the solar atmosphere . much of the photospheric flux , however , closes before it reaches the corona @xcite so the challenge is to determine what activity is relevant to the coronal dynamics we observe .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in co - operation with esa and nsc ( norway ) .",
    "we thank spiros patsourakos for preparing the stereo euvi data for us .",
    "we also thank the referee for a thorough reading of the manuscript and many insightful comments ."
