    "supersymmetry ( susy ) deeply fascinates us as a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "it has , however , to be broken because superparticles have not been discovered yet .",
    "the phenomenological aspects such as mass spectrum , collider signature and so forth , depend on how susy is broken .",
    "therefore , to understand the susy breaking mechanism is important . in superstring theory ,",
    "one of the most plausible mediation mechanisms is the moduli mediation . on the other hand ,",
    "the mediation associated with the super - weyl anomaly , the anomaly mediation , is also inevitable .",
    "recently , kklt @xcite have proposed the interesting set - up to stabilize the modulus with the relatively heavy mass by considering some non - perturbative effects , and in this and similar set - ups , the anomaly mediation contribution is comparable with the modulus mediation one .",
    "this type of mediation mechanism is often called the mirage mediation @xcite .",
    "the mirage mediation is a natural mediation mechanism in the string modulus stabilization and very interesting because it can solve the tachyonic slepton problem in the pure anomaly mediation , and it has characteristic mass spectra as well .",
    "however , it suffers from two crucial problems .",
    "one is the @xmath2-/@xmath3-problem and the other results from cosmology .",
    "the former stems from the fact that @xmath4 parameter would easily become of the order of the gravitino mass , @xmath5 , which is @xmath6 tev .",
    "the latter leads to the result that the sizable production rate of gravitinos from the modulus decay aggravates the conventional moduli problem @xcite .",
    "( see , for the case of the inflaton and the polonyi field @xcite ) .",
    "such aggravation comes from the overclosure of the neutralinos produced by the gravitinos if it is the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) . in this talk",
    ", we show that axionic extension of mirage mediation , _ axionic mirage mediation _",
    "@xcite , can solve not only the @xmath2-/@xmath3-problem but the cosmological moduli problem simultaneously .",
    "let us consider the hadronic axion model in the kklt set - up by introducing the axion superfield @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs of messenger fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath7 is a singlet under any unbroken gauge symmetry , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are vectorlike representation of the su(5 ) gauge group and we use @xmath11 to denote the modulus .",
    "we assigned the pq charge as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the superpotential has yukawa coupling , @xmath15 which is allowed by the pq symmetry .",
    "the hat means the absorption of the chiral compensator @xmath16 , that is @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath7 is a flat direction in susy limit , however , it is lifted by the susy breaking , @xmath18 , caused by the mirage mediation . here",
    ", @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for the auxiliary field of the modulus and that of the compensator , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is stabilized far away from the origin , breaking the pq symmetry .",
    "since this gives a huge mass for the messengers , we can integrate out the messengers .",
    "this leads to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave function renormalization of @xmath7 at @xmath23 and @xmath24 the modular weight of @xmath7 .",
    "according to the renormalization group equation ( rge ) of @xmath25 , we can find that the scalar potential of @xmath7 has a minimum at some scale @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we depicted @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 in fig.[fig : pq scale ] .",
    "it is noted that the pq scale , @xmath28 , can be within , so - called , the axion window @xmath29 gev . in",
    "what follows , we consider the case @xmath30 gev .     in the axionic mirage mediation",
    "here , @xmath31 is the modular weight of the messenger .",
    ", width=207 ]    from eq .",
    ", we can find that the mass of the axino @xmath32 , which is the superpartner of the axion , is calculated at two - loop order in contrast with the masses of the other fields being at one - loop .",
    "thus it will be the lsp and candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "an important property of this model is that it provides a natural solution to the @xmath2-/@xmath3-problem .",
    "let us consider the following superpotential and @xmath33 function ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath34 where we introduced new singlets @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , whose pq charge is assigned as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants .",
    "the function @xmath33 has a relation to the khler potential @xmath43 via @xmath44 . for simplicity ,",
    "the modular weight of singlets is set to be zero . when @xmath35 gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , integrating out @xmath37 leads to the @xmath2-/@xmath3-term in canonical normaization : @xmath45   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 being the modular weight of the higgs fields @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "since they are the same order of soft masses , the @xmath2-/@xmath3-problem can be solved .",
    "it is noted that in our model there is also no susy cp problem . since the phases of two susy - breaking @xmath49-terms , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are aligned @xcite , we find that the phase of @xmath4 can be rotated away simultaneously with that of the gaugino mass and @xmath52-term .",
    "therefore , we constructed a model in which there is no @xmath2-problem as well as susy cp problem .",
    "in this section , we discuss the cosmological implications of our model .",
    "we assume that the modulus and the saxion , which is the real part of the scalar component of the axion superfield , are displaced from their true minima with the amplitude of the order of the planck scale , and their coherent oscillation start before the reheating due to the inflaton decay is completed . in this case , we can find that it is sufficient to discuss the cosmic evolution only after the modulus decay because of a large amount of the entropy production . in what follows , we address the implications of the modulus decay in cosmology .",
    "there are four processes producing the axino lsp via the modulus decay ( see , fig.[fig : figure of decay ] ) .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the axino abundance is given by the _ 4th .",
    "process_. we investigated the relic abundance of the axino in various cases with the nlsp being bino , higgsino , stau , stop and wino .",
    "the result is summarized in the table.1 . here ,",
    "case a and b represent that the annihilation rate of the nlsp at the gravitino decay is negligible and significant , respectively .",
    "it is noted that when the annihilation process of the nlsp is not effective , the relic abundance of the axino becomes the same value in any nlsp cases .",
    "denotes the nlsp .",

    "we are now ready to discuss whether the axino relic abundance accords with the present dm abundance . in fig.[fig : contour of axion with modulus mass ] , we plotted the axino mass density in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . from the wmap three year results @xcite , the dm abundance in the present universe is @xmath55 ( 68 @xmath56 c.l . ) .",
    "thus , we find from fig.[fig : contour of axion with modulus mass ] that the axino with @xmath57 mev can explain the present dm abundance in any nlsp cases , if the decay of the nlsp is more effective than the annihilation in the @xmath58 . in fig.[fig :",

    "we have discussed the axionic extension of mirage mediation , _ axionic mirage mediation _ , to remedy crucial problems in the mirage mediation : the @xmath2-problem and the moduli problem .",

    "furthermore , we found that the axino with mass of @xmath64 mev  @xmath65 gev can constitute the dm of the universe .",
    "finally we would like to briefly mention signatures of neutralino nlsp decays at collider experiments . in our model ,",
