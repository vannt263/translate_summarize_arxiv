    "when the mass accretion rate is high , a black hole binary ( bhb ) resides in the soft state , which is characterized by a very soft spectrum , accompanied by a power - law tail .",
    "the soft spectral component is believed to be thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disk around a central bh ( e.g. , makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) , because it can be reproduced by a multi - color disk model ( mcd model , mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) which approximates emission from a standard accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the model has two parameters ; the maximum color temperature of the disk , @xmath3 , and an apparent inner radius @xmath4 . using a spectral hardening factor of @xmath52.0 ( shimura & takahara 1997 ) , and a correction factor for the inner boundary condition , @xmath6 ( kubota et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath4 can be related to the true inner radius @xmath7 , as @xmath8 x - ray observations indicate that @xmath7 remains constant at @xmath9 that is the last stable orbit for a non - spinning bh ( @xmath10 is the gravitational radius ) .",
    "although this `` standard picture '' remained generally successful ( e.g. , ebisawa et al .",
    "1993 , tanaka & lewin 1995 ) , recently two deviations from its predictions have been noticed in some soft - state bhbs .",
    "one is quite small values of @xmath7 , compared to @xmath9 , and the other is significant variations in @xmath7 .",
    "the former is found in the superluminal jet sources , gro j@xmath0 and grs @xmath11 ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "the latter includes gro j@xmath0 ( sobczak et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter s99 ) , lmc x-1 ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) and xte j@xmath12 ( kubota 2001 ) .",
    "although these anomalies are often attributed , e.g. , to strong disk comptonization and/or very high value of @xmath13 , no convincing evidence has been available .",
    "these issues may be related to the general theoretical belief that the standard - disk picture is valid only for a rather limited range of the mass accretion rate ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in order to examine to",
    "what extent the standard picture is valid , we have analyzed x - ray spectra of gro j@xmath0 obtained by multiple pointings with _",
    "rxte_. this bhb has been reported to exhibit the two peculiarities mentioned above . moreover ,",
    "its bh mass , distance , and inclination angle are accurately estimated to be @xmath14 , @xmath15 kpc , and @xmath16 , respectively ( e.g. , orosz & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "these make gro j@xmath0 ideal for our purpose .",
    "we analyzed 72 archival data sets of gro j@xmath0 obtained with the _ rxte_/pca , covering the 16-months outburst in 19961997 .",
    "this is the same dataset as utilized by s99 except for the last few observations when the source exhibited a signature of the hard state .",
    "we co - added the data from the individual proportional counter units , and produced one co - added spectrum for each pointing .",
    "we select good data in the basic manner for bright sources .",
    "we estimated the pca background for each observation using _ pcabackest _ version 2.1e . in order to correct a possible @xmath17 % over / under - estimation of the background by the _ pcabackest _",
    ", we compared the on - source spectra and the predicted model background spectra in the hardest energy band ( 60100 kev ) , where the signal flux is usually negligible . when necessary , we adjusted the normalization factor of the background spectrum by @xmath18 .",
    "we make the response matrix for each observation using _ pcarsp _ version 7.10 , and add 1% systematic error to each energy bin of the pca spectrum . over the 2035 kev range",
    ", we increased the systematic error to 10% , to take into account the response uncertainties associated with the xe - k edge at @xmath19 kev .",
    "according to the canonical spectral modeling , we fit the obtained 330 kev pca spectra of gro j@xmath0 with the mcd plus a power - law . after yamaoka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we subject the mcd component to several absorption features ( a line and edges )",
    ". we do not discuss these absorption features any further .",
    "to the two constituent continuum components , we apply a common photoelectric absorption with the column fixed at @xmath20 , by referring to the _ asca_/gis data of this source on 1997 feb.26 ( kubota 2001 ) . moreover , as for the data obtained before 1996 may 21 ( mjd 50224 ) , we fix the power - law photon index @xmath21 2.1 , because the power - law component was too weak to constrain @xmath21 .",
    "the fits have been acceptable for all the pca spectra . in fig.1",
    ", we show evolution of the best - fit model parameters , including the disk bolometric luminosity , @xmath22 ) , the 1100 kev power - law luminosity , @xmath23 , calculated assuming an isotropic emission , and their sum , @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the entire pca data span of this source can be divided into three characteristic periods , referring mainly to @xmath23 .",
    "the 1st period ( period 1 ; before day 141 ) is characterized by a very low level of @xmath23 , while it is very high ( @xmath25 ) in period 2 , which was once called `` very high state '' by s99 . in period 3 ( after the data gap ) , @xmath23 returns low .    in period 3",
    ", the values of @xmath7 , which are obtained by utilizing eq.(1 ) with @xmath26 and @xmath6 , remain constant ( 26 km ) against relatively large intensity variation , while in period 2 they are observed to change significantly between @xmath27 km and @xmath28 km .",
    "when we fix @xmath7 at 26 km and instead allow @xmath29 to vary , the fits for the period 1 and 2 data become significantly worse ( fig.1e ) , and @xmath29 changes violently .",
    "thus , the variation of @xmath7 is real as long as we utilize the canonical two components model with constant values of @xmath13 and @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , gro  j@xmath0 in period 2 violates the standard picture .    in order to highlight the anomalies of gro j@xmath0 , we plot @xmath31 against @xmath3 in fig.2a . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the data points of a typical bhb , lmc x-3 ( e.g. , kuiper et al .",
    "1988 ) , of which the bh mass ( 57.2  @xmath32 ) and the inclination angle ( 65@xmath3369@xmath33 ) are both quite similar to those of gro j@xmath0 .",
    "the results on lmc x-3 were obtained through the spectral fitting of the same pca data as reported by wilms et al .",
    "thus , the data points for lmc x-3 follow a simple relation of @xmath34 with a constant @xmath7 as @xmath31 varied by a factor of 10 .",
    "moreover , assuming its distance and inclination angle as 55 kpc and @xmath35 respectively , the absolute value of @xmath7 is calculated as @xmath36 km , which coincide with @xmath9 for a bh of @xmath37 . in other words ,",
    "the accretion disk in lmc x-3 perfectly satisfies the standard picture .",
    "in contrast , gro j@xmath0 exhibits a distinct behavior on this @xmath3-@xmath31 plane .",
    "the data points in period 2 and period 1 deviate from the standard @xmath34 relation , while those of period 3 satisfy the relation except that the value of @xmath7 is much smaller than that of lmc x-3 .",
    "although the deviation from the standard picture has been found in both period 1 and 2 , it is much more significant in period 2 than in period 1 .",
    "in addition , the observed pca spectra in period 1 are relatively similar to those in period 3 ( see s99 ) , while those in period 2 are characterized by very strong hard emission component . therefore in this letter , we mainly focussed on the anomalous behavior in period 2 .",
    "hereafter , we call period 2 _ anomalous regime _ , while call period 3 _ standard regime_.      a prominent difference between the _ anomalous _ and _ standard _ regimes is found in behavior of the power - law component . in the _ anomalous regime",
    "_ , @xmath23 negatively correlates to @xmath31 , in such a way that @xmath24 is kept approximately constant at a ceiling value of @xmath38 ( fig.1a ) . to our surprise",
    ", this ceiling corresponds roughly to @xmath39 % of the eddington luminosity , @xmath40 ( assuming solar abundance ) for a @xmath41 bh in gro j@xmath0 , instead of @xmath42 itself .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig.3 , @xmath21 gradually increases as @xmath23 gets higher in the _ anomalous regime _ , while it stays constant at @xmath22.1 in the _ standard regime_. therefore , the property of the hard component in the _ anomalous regime _ may be intrinsically different from that in the _",
    "standard regime_.    a simple interpretation of the source behavior in the _ anomalous regime _ is to presume that there emerges a third spectral component , which is harder than the mcd emission but softer than the hard component in the _ standard regime_. then , the strong anti - correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath31 , seen in the _ anomalous regime _ , can be explained by assuming that this third component strongly and negatively correlates with the mcd component .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that some fraction of the photons emitted from the optically thick accretion disk are converted into the third spectral component , instead of directly reaching us .",
    "the third component is most probably produced through inverse - compton scattering of the mcd photons by high energy electrons that may reside around the disk .",
    "we re - fit the same pca spectra in the _ anomalous regime _",
    ", with a three - component model , obtained by adding a comptonized blackbody ( `` _ compbb _ '' ; nishimura , mitsuda , & itoh 1986 ) component to the original two component model .",
    "the _ compbb _ model has four parameters ; blackbody temperature @xmath43 , electron temperature @xmath44 , compton optical depth @xmath45 , and radiative area of the blackbody for an isotropic emission .",
    "however , we can not constrain all these additional parameters , since the previous two - component model has given acceptable fits .",
    "we accordingly tie @xmath43 to @xmath3 , assuming the seed photons for the inverse - compton to be supplied by the optically thick accretion disk .",
    "we fix @xmath21 of the original power - law component to 2.1 , an average in the _ standard regime _",
    "( fig.3 ) . furthermore , to avoid a strong coupling between @xmath45 and @xmath44 , we fix @xmath44 at a representative value of 10 kev , considering that strong compton cooling by ample seed soft photons from the optically - thick disk will make @xmath44 significantly lower than in the hard state ( @xmath463050 kev ; e.g. , grove et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in fig.1c , we plot the re - estimated @xmath3 with open circles . by considering the _ compbb _ component , the highly deviated data points in terms of @xmath3 have thus settled back to a smooth long - term trend .",
    "we also re - estimate the luminosity in fig.2b as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the estimated 0.1100 kev _ compbb _ luminosity , assuming an isotropic emission .",
    "thus , @xmath47 plotted against the revised @xmath3 approximately recovers the standard @xmath49 relation for optically - thick accretion disks .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath7 can also be considered to remain relatively stable , even when a significant fraction of the mcd photons is comptonized .",
    "we conclude that some part of the power - law seen in the _ anomalous regime _ has the origin in the mcd photons , modified through the inverse - compton process , and that the violent variations in the mcd parameters , on time scales of few days or shorter , is not real but apparent .",
    "figure 4a shows the typical pca spectrum of gro j@xmath0 in the _ anomalous regime _ , which corresponds to observation a ( 1996 aug . 6 ; day 218 ) presented in fig.1a ,",
    "fitted with the three - component model .",
    "we also show the result from the previous two - component fit in fig.4b , where the best - fit model is obtained in the range of 330 kev . although the spectrum is shown in 350 kev .",
    "in  3 , we have shown that the scenario of the strong disk comptonization successfully explains the _ anomalous regime _ of gro j@xmath0 , and that the underlying disk really satisfies the standard picture .",
    "a very similar phenomenon has been observed in another galactic jet source , xte j@xmath12 ( kubota 2001 ) .",
    "although the disk comptonization has been discussed extensively in the literature , our results provide one of the first unambiguous observational confirmations of such a picture .",
    "then , what causes such a strong comptonization ? as mentioned in  1 , it was theoretically pointed out that the standard disk can not be stable under high accretion rates . the _ anomalous regime _ can be hence considered to occur when the accretion rate reaches a certain upper critical level , as indicated by the location of _ anomalous regime _",
    "( upper right ) in fig.2b .",
    "we however remember that the critical disk luminosity , at which the _ anomalous _ behavior of gro j@xmath0 appears , is only @xmath39% of @xmath42 , and that lmc x-3 exhibits no such deviation from the standard - disk even with @xmath31 close to @xmath42 .",
    "another important difference between these two bhbs is that the value of @xmath7 for gro j@xmath0 is only @xmath50 for a @xmath51 bh even in the _ standard regime _ , while that of lmc x-3 agrees with @xmath9 .",
    "this fact makes the values of @xmath3 for gro j@xmath0 much higher than those for lmc x-3 when compared at the similar luminosity .",
    "interestingly , the observed value of the temperature of gro j@xmath0 , @xmath52 kev , which corresponds to the critical luminosity , is almost the same as the upper limit of @xmath53 kev ) for lmc x-3 .",
    "we hence suggest that the endpoint of the _ standard regime _ is not determined by the luminosity but instead by the temperature , which is thought to be @xmath541.3 kev for both lmc x-3 and gro j@xmath0 .",
    "such a consideration is consistent with a theoretical expectation that , at a high temperature , the opacity of the disk is given by electron scattering instead of photo - electric absorption that dominates at lower temperatures .",
    "thus , we consider that the systematically higher @xmath3 ( or smaller @xmath7 ) is responsible for the anomalous behavior of gro j@xmath0 . because the innermost stable orbit becomes smaller for a prograde rotation around a spinning bh , down to @xmath55 in the extreme case , the anomalous behavior of gro j@xmath0 may be attributed ultimately to its bh spin , as already suggested by zhang et al .",
