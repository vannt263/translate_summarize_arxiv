    "non - extensive statistical mechanics ( nesm ) is a generalization of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics aiming to overcome a number of physical systems that possess exotic properties , such as broken ergodicity , strong correlation between elements , multi fractality of phase - space and long - range interactions .",
    "the nesm framework proposed by tsallis @xcite is based on the nonadditive @xmath0-entropy @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a positive constant , @xmath4 is the number of microscopic states , and @xmath5 is a normalized probability distribution .",
    "in fact , additivity for two probabilistically independent subsystems a and b is generalized by the following pseudoadditivity : @xmath6 for subsystems that have special probability correlations , extensivity is not valid for boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy , but may occur for @xmath7 with a particular value of the index @xmath8 , called the @xmath0-entropic parameter . in the limit @xmath9 , bg entropy is additive , i.e , @xmath10 and eq . (",
    "[ 1 ] ) reduces to the usual boltzmann and gibbs formula @xmath11 , which is the fundamental expression describing systems that usually do not present the exotic properties described above .",
    "several consequences of this generalized framework have been investigated in the literature @xcite ( see also @xcite for a regularly updated bibliography ) .",
    "this includes systems of interest in high energy physics , e.g. , the problem of solar neutrino @xcite , the charm quark dynamics in a thermal quark - gluon plasma for the case of collisional equilibration @xcite , interpretations for central au - au collisions at rhic energies in a relativistic diffusion model ( rdm ) @xcite , among others @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we discuss non - extensive effects on nuclear matter at zero baryon density . to this end",
    "we adopt the relativistic phenomenological approach developed by walecka  @xcite , the so - called quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) . by taking into account the results on the phase transion in nuclear matter discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that there exist a thermodynamical dependence between the statistical correlations characterized by non - extensive parameter @xmath0 and the coupling constant @xmath23 . a numerical relation in the @xmath24 plane resulting in regions of differents thermodynamical behaviors",

    "in this section , by considering the same arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , we explore the non - additive phase structure of the effective lagrangian at vanishing chemical potential and baryon density ( @xmath45 ) . to this end",
    ", we first consider the range of values for the coupling constant @xmath1 given by @xmath46 in the coupling - constant plane shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . at vanishing chemical potential",
    ", the terms with the baryon density do not appear in eqs .",

    "what follows , we will take as an example @xmath47 .",
    "theis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the order of phase transition is strongly dependent on the actual value of the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that we can avoid maxwell construction by the variation of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "since the order of transition depends on @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the natural question is whether there exists some relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 at zero baryon density .    in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , the sudden drop in @xmath28 around @xmath48 mev determines the abrupt rise of the energy density and pressure .",
    "we note that for @xmath49 ( fermi - dirac statistics ) the self - consistency equation ( [ ms ] ) has three solutions around @xmath48 mev imposing a sudden rise in the energy density and a peak in the specific heat .",
    "this behavior is shown in figs .",
    "( 2)-(4 ) , where the temperature dependence of total energy density , pressure and specific heat divided by the corresponding high stephan - boltzmann temperature limit ( for @xmath49 ) , given by eq .",
    "( 26 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , are displayed .",
    "the behavior of the curves for @xmath49 characterizes a first order phase transition with the pressure curve crossing itself twice at @xmath48 mev .",
    "we observe that in this region the energy density and presure are also triple valued and that the specific heat is negative .",
    "the value of @xmath50 was obtained by requiring that energy density and pressure to be single valued characterizing a second order phase transition with non - negative specific heat .",
    "this allows to obtain a relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 explained below   mev , the effective mass being very small , the system decouples to an almost free - massles nucleon gas . in the present case , this depends on the actual values of @xmath51 and @xmath0 . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , this is analogous to the expected chiral phase transition in high - temperature qcd .",
    "however , in walecka theory , there is no liberation of the internal constituents of the nucleons .",
    "thus , the phase transition in qhd theory can not be interpreted as a baryon - quark matter one . ] .      in order to obtain such a relation , in what follows",
    "we investigate the thermodynamical behavior of the nuclear matter for several values of the coupling constant @xmath1 in the @xmath53 plane . for each value of @xmath1",
    ", the corresponding parameter @xmath0 , for which the transition is of second order , is determined .",
    "thus , a curve in the @xmath53 plane is obtained as shown in fig .",
    "( 5a ) . below this curve the phase transitions",
    "are of the first order and above it the thermodynamical behavior is smooth .",
    "let us now show how the calculation is made via specific heat .    differently from the treatment discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mathematical structure of the self - consistency equation in our approach is not simple , so that the calculation must be done numerically .",
    "we observe that the specific heat calculated from eq .",
    "( [ edens ] ) is linear in @xmath54 .",
    "thus , whenever there is a sudden fall in @xmath28 , we see a peak in the specific heat . by writing @xmath55 we can see from eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) that @xmath56 where @xmath57 the singularities of @xmath54 lie in the curve determined by the vanishing of the denominator .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) , this condition becomes @xmath58 note that , for @xmath49 , we fully recover eq .",
    "( 18 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the number of intersections of the solutions obtained from eq .",
    "( [ dmdt2 ] ) and the self - consistency equation given by eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) determines how decoupling happens .",
    "we have a first or a second order phase transition , respectively , for two or one intersections .",
    "if there is no intersections , the thermodynamical behavior is continuous .",
    "the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "( 5a ) can be summarized as follows :    * for @xmath0 lying below the @xmath59 curve the phase transitions are of the first order . * for @xmath0 lying on the @xmath59 curve",
    "the phase transitions are of the second order .",
    "the corresponding values of temperatures and effective masses are shown in figs .",
    "( 5b ) and ( 5c ) . * for @xmath0 lying above the @xmath59 curve",
    "the decoupling is continuous .",
    "therefore , the order of phase transitions depends not only on the actual values of @xmath1 but also on the values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated some effects of the tsallis nesm on the mean field theory of walecka ( qhd ) @xcite . instead of the standard fermi - dirac nucleon and antinucleon distribution functions ,",
    "we have used the @xmath0-quantum distribution obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "although there is no long range interactions in nuclear matter ( coulombian interaction is not included in our analysis ) , it is worth emphasizing that the nesm effects appear due to the strong statistical correlations between elements of nuclear system .",
    "we have examined the phase structure of nuclear matter at high temperature and at zero baryon density .",
    "the effective lagrangian of qhd theory is considered for the same set of values of the coupling constants in the coupling constant - plane of ref .",
    "@xcite . given",
    "that , at vanishing baryon density , the term with the baryon density do not appear in the equation of state , a relation between the coupling constant @xmath1 and the parameter @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "as discussed , such a relation determines , in the @xmath59 plane , regions of different thermodynamical behaviors .",
