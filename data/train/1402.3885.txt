    "matter - wave interferometry constitutes an important application of quantum interference with both fundamental and practical interests @xcite . in analogy to optics ,",
    "this sensitive technique allows us to determine properties of the diffracted particles as well as of any other element acting on them during their transit through the interferometer .",
    "it was at the beginning of the 1990s when kasevich and chu @xcite showed that matter - wave mach - zehnder interferometry can be achieved by using the same basic ideas of its optical analog : if the atomic wave function can be coherently split up , and later on each diffracted wave is conveniently redirected in order to eventually achieve their recombination on some space region , then an interference pattern will arise on that spot . for neutral atoms",
    "this can be done by means of periodic gratings , which play the role of optical beam splitters .",
    "this property , exploited in different diffraction experiments with fundamental purposes @xcite , gave rise to the former experimental implementations of atomic mach - zehnder interferometers in the early 1990s , first with transmission gratings @xcite and then with light standing waves @xcite .",
    "these interferometers are based on a very efficient production of spatially separated coherent waves @xcite .",
    "similar interferometers are also used for large molecules @xcite , although due to their relatively smaller thermal wavelength , they work within the near field or fresnel regime , benefiting from the grating self - imaging produced by the so - called talbot - lau effect @xcite , a combination of the talbot @xcite and lau @xcite effects .     sketch of an atomic three - grating mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "this class of interferometers consists of three equally - spaced ( @xmath0 ) , parallel gratings , namely @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "these gratings play the role of the set of beam splitters ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) and mirrors ( @xmath2 ) of a conventional optical interferometer.,width=302 ]    to describe and analyze this kind of experiments different analytical and numerical treatments have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , there is a substantial gap between simple models and exact numerical simulations , which makes difficult getting a unified view of the physics involved in these experiments .",
    "consequently , many times our understanding of them is oversimplified , which leads us to emphasize `` paradoxical '' aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "one of these aspects is , for example , the commonly assumed wave - particle dual nature of quantum systems .",
    "depending on how the experiment is performed , one `` decides '' between one or the other , which manifests as one or another type of outcome .",
    "now , leaving aside ontological issues , a pragmatic , accurate description of the experiment requires the use of a wave function .",
    "the evolution of this wave function in the course of the experiment is strongly influenced by the boundary conditions associated with such an experiment , as well as by any other physical effect that might take place ( e.g. , presence of photon scattering events @xcite ) , which will unavoidably lead to different outcomes .",
    "that is , any trace of paradox disappears if we just focus on the wave function and all the factors that affect it during the performance of the experiment  we obtain what should be obtained , leaving not much room for speculating about dual behaviors .",
    "this is precisely the scenario posed by atomic mach - zehnder interferometers , where it is common to describe the evolution between consecutive gratings in terms of classical - like paths ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , although their recombination ( and , actually , also their emergence ) has to do with a pure wave - like behavior .",
    "moved by these facts and their important implications , here we revisit the problem with a working model consisting of a set of three gratings with gaussian slits ( slits characterized by a gaussian transmission function ) , while its analysis is conducted by means of a combination of the position and momentum representations of the ( atomic ) wave function . as is shown",
    ", the synergy between analytical results and numerical simulations obtained in this way helps to describe and understand the functioning of these interferometers in a relatively simple manner .",
    "specifically , we provide a clear picture of the wavefront splitting process that takes place at the gratings , showing how the typical path - like picture of the interferometer @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) coexists with the complex interference patterns exhibited by the wave function between consecutive gratings .",
    "this is a key point to understand the simplified models commonly used in the literature to explain this type of interferometers , where the particular shape of the wave function is neglected and only the momentum carried along the paths associated with each involved diffraction order is considered . in this regard",
    ", we have introduced the concept of local transverse momentum , borrowed from the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , as analytical tool . by means of this quantity",
    "it is possible to properly quantify the local value of the momentum ( not to be confused with the usual momentum expectation value ) at each point of the transverse coordinate , which is related to the quantum flux @xcite evaluated on that point .",
    "furthermore , we would also like to stress the practical side of this model as an efficient tool to attack analogous problems with presence of incoherence sources and/or decoherent events in a simple manner .",
    "this work has been organized as follows .",
    "the general theoretical elements involved in our analysis of the atomic three - grating mach - zehnder interferometer are described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , including the gaussian grating model considered .",
    "analytical results obtained from this model in the far field are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "the outcomes from the numerical simulations illustrating different aspects of the wave - function full evolution between consecutive gratings are analyzed and discussed in sec .",
    "the conclusions from this work are summarized in sec .",
    "atomic three - grating mach - zehnder interferometers consist of three evenly - spaced and parallel periodic gratings , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this sketch",
    "the slits are parallel to the @xmath4 axis and span a relatively long distance ( larger than the cross - section of the incident beam ) .",
    "this implies translational invariance along the @xmath4 axis , which makes diffraction to be independent of this coordinate and allows a reduction of the problem dimensionality to the transverse ( @xmath5 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath6 ) directions . under realistic experimental working conditions , taken from the former 1991 experiment by keith et al .",
    "@xcite ( see sec .  [ sec22 ] ) , the propagation of the atomic beam along the longitudinal direction is typically faster than its translational spreading @xcite . from the experimental data reported in @xcite",
    ", we notice that the distance between consecutive gratings is of the order of half a meter , while the separation between consecutive diffraction orders is about a few tenths of microns .",
    "these are just paraxial conditions , which allow us to decouple the transverse and longitudinal ( translational ) degrees of freedom for practical purposes .",
    "this assumption not only simplifies the analytical treatment , but also provides us with a neater dynamical picture of the emergence of well - resolved diffraction orders and their subsequent recombination ( see sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] ) , avoiding the complexities involved by reflections at the gratings @xcite . also for simplicity ,",
    "short - range interactions between the diffracted particles and the grating @xcite , as well as imperfections or thermal effects associated with the latter @xcite , are neglected in this work , although they can be easily implemented by varying some of the parameters of the model ( see discussion in this regard in sec .",
    "[ sec22 ] ) .",
    "the atoms leaving the source follow a boltzmann velocity distribution at a temperature @xmath7 , which implies an associated average thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "although the beam is not fully monochromatic under these conditions , the presence of two consecutive collimating slits beyond the source leads to a nearly plane ( monochromatic ) wavefront behind the second of these slits .",
    "this is the beam impinging on @xmath1 . in spite of possible deviations from full monochromaticity , for practical purposes and analytical simplicity",

    "given that the longitudinal component of the wave function is a plane wave that propagates with velocity @xmath21 , the problem can be reparameterized in terms of the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the wave function ( [ eqmrept3 ] ) describing the wave function evolution along the transverse direction ( accounted for by the @xmath5 coordinate ) can be recast in terms of this coordinate , ( x , z ) ( x,0 ) e^ik(x - x)^2/2z dx , [ e14 ] with @xmath22 .",
    "this form is mass - independent and therefore can be used advantageously to describe massive particles as well as light ( when the latter is described by a scalar field @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between various problems is established by the initial condition @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the starting position along the @xmath6 axis from which the ( transverse ) wave function starts its propagation .",
    "if the gratings are assumed to be infinitesimally thin along the longitudinal direction , we can consider a simple relationship between the ansatz and the incident wave function : _",

    "the aspect ratio of the wave function remains invariant with @xmath6 or , equivalently , with time .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath39 is related to the grating transmission , the far - field wave function is just a manifestation of the grating structure , thus providing us with information about it and not only about properties of the diffracted atom .",

    "[ e26b ]      in order to get a more quantitative idea on the amplitude splitting process and the subsequent recombination , now we are going to introduce a simple model consisting of three identical periodic gratings with gaussian slits .",
    "by gaussian slit we just mean a slit characterized by a gaussian transmission function @xcite , i.e. , a transmission which is maximum at the center of the slit and decreases smoothly in a gaussian fashion towards the slit boundaries .",
    "this behavior can be observed , for example , in situations where the problem is tackled from a scattering viewpoint and the interaction between the slit and the diffracted particle is modeled by means of a realistic interaction soft potential @xcite .",
    "gaussian transmissions are also in compliance with the fact that the incident beam is not fully monochromatic ( see sec .  [ sec2 ] ) , which leads to a relatively fast decay ( actually , in a gaussian fashion ) of eventual diffraction orders as we move apart from the incident propagation direction ( in agreement with real matter wave experimental observations ) .",

    "the amount of atoms passing through @xmath3 will depend on @xmath109 , and so the total flux collected behind @xmath3 .",

    "the repetitive structures near both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are associated with a typical effect of periodic gratings on extended waves , namely the so - called talbot effect @xcite .",
    "this effect is shown with more detail in the enlargements near @xmath1 displayed in the left - hand side panels of fig .",
    "the grating acts on the impinging wave as a collimator that generates a series of identically diffracted waves .",
    "the periodicity in the distribution of these waves is such that , if one recast each diffracted wave as a superposition of plane waves , a certain quantization condition arises , which only allows certain momenta @xcite .",
    "the larger the number of slits the lesser the number of allowed momenta , until reaching a minimum given by the ideal case of @xmath141 . due to this finite basis of momenta , as @xmath6 increases we observe that the probability density displays recurrences along @xmath5 within a distance @xmath101 .",
    "thus , at distances @xmath142  mm we find an exact copy of the initial probability density , where @xmath143 is the so - called talbot distance . now , because there are no physical boundaries separating different slits , we also find exact copies of the probability density at the talbot distance , although they have a half a period displacement with respect to the initial pattern .",
    "these copies will cover a larger spatial region as @xmath58 increases , because the basis of momenta will be more limited ( compare panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",

    "regardless of the number of illuminated slits , this pattern has a period @xmath101 .",
    "it is then clear that if @xmath3 is gradually moved laterally with respect to this pattern , for some positions the atomic flux passing through the grating will be maximum ( in phase ) , and for other it will be minimum ( out of phase ) , observing a periodic variation ( with period @xmath101 ) , in compliance with eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) . as it was stressed above",
    ", the emergence of this pattern is precisely the reason why this peak is important for interferometry : any small perturbation on any of the two paths selected between @xmath1 and @xmath2 affects its fringe visibility , which can be directly detected through the amount of flux measured behind @xmath3 .",
    "the interference pattern at @xmath3 and the amount of transmitted flux as a function of the displacement @xmath109 for @xmath125 and @xmath124 are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , where the experimental data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are also included ( full blue circles in panel ( b ) ) .",
    "more specifically , in order to avoid contamination from other adjacent diffraction structures , we have performed the convolution integral in both cases within the range between @xmath146  @xmath47 m and @xmath147  @xmath47 m ( just around @xmath98 ) , with @xmath109 varying between @xmath148 and @xmath149 in the figure only two periods are shown . in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) , the results of panel ( b ) display the same cosine dependence with @xmath109 in either case , in good agreement with the experimental data reported . nonetheless , because the total amount of flux collected is larger for @xmath125 than for @xmath124 ( the extension covered by the interference pattern is larger ) , and also for a better comparison with the experimental data , instead of directly plotting eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) , we have considered the normalized function = , where @xmath150 and @xmath151 . moreover , the maxima of the numerical calculations have also been shifted in order to align them with those of the experimental data . nonetheless , unlike the models considered in the literature",
    ", we would like to highlight that here no best - fit procedure has been used in any of the steps to adjust our results to the reported experimental data ; the agreement between our simulations and the experiment directly arises from the few working hypotheses considered above .",
    "we have shown that by using the relationship between the configuration and momentum representations of a wave function it is possible a simple analysis of atomic three - grating mach - zehnder interferometers .",
    "this analysis shows how three gratings behave in the same way as the set of two beam - splitters and two mirrors does in conventional optical mach - zehnder interferometers . as a convenient working model we have considered a gaussian grating given its analytical and computational advantages . on the one hand ,",
    "this type of grating has allowed us to obtain a series of analytical expansions and results in the far field , which can be readily compared to the experiment , providing us with an important physical insight on the interferometers here considered . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the time - evolution of gaussian wave packets ( or , equivalently , their propagation along the longitudinal direction ) is fully analytical , also constitutes a remarkable simplification in the design of simple numerical codes that allow to compute the probability density or the local transverse momentum at any intermediate step between two consecutive gratings . in this regard ,",
    "the local transverse momentum has been introduced as an important analytical tool , borrowed from the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics and related to the usual flux operator .",
    "based on this working model , a reasonable ansatz for the passage through the second grating can also be easily proposed , without any need to use more complex and higher time - consuming wave - packet propagation techniques @xcite , where the presence of gratings is usually introduced in terms of interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "the information obtained from the analytical and numerical results not only complements each other , but is very valuable to understand different aspects of how atomic three - grating mach - zehnder interferometers work . from experimental data , the analytical results have shown in a simple manner how the two branches of the interferometer appear as well as how , later on , they coalesce and give rise to an interference structure with the same period of the gratings .",
    "in particular , first one readily notices that because the diffraction orders are well separated spatially , one can work with only two of them , neglecting other contributions .",
    "this fact relies on the property that only the probability along the diffraction orders @xmath152 and @xmath153 is physically relevant .",
    "this has been confirmed by the numerical simulations . in spite of the rather complex evolution displayed by the wave function between consecutive gratings , particularly in the corresponding near field regions , in practice",
    "this does not count much , this showing the correctness of oversimplified sketches like the one displayed in fig .",
    "hence , bringing back the old wave - corpuscle dichotomy , we have shown that wave and particle are not incompatible aspects , but the misuse that we typically do of them to explain and understand these experiments .",
    "the incident atomic beam behaves as a wave all the way through , although in the transit one can simplify the picture by assuming that the atoms behave as classical point - like particles moving along straight lines .",
    "of course , this is done at the expense of neglecting the rich interference structures that arise along the way .    from a practical viewpoint",
    ", we would also like to highlight the fact that the simplicity of the model here considered makes feasible the analysis of incoherence due to a lack of full periodicity in the gratings , presence of thermal vibrations , or decoherence by an external environment in a simple manner .",
    "this can be done by playing around with the different parameters associated with the gaussians as well as with the way how the latter overlap .",
    "indeed , both the model and the methodology here developed are not constrained to the system that we have analyzed , but they can be easily and conveniently implemented in other experimental contexts due to their versatility .",
    "notice that , generally speaking , the main purpose of this work consists in providing a clear , precise and simple methodology ( working model ) to simulate , analyze , understand and explain interference processes and interferometry experiments .",
    "this is something in the borderline between the simplistic approaches often considered in the literature ( which always require of fitting parameters and do not account for the full dynamical process that takes place inside the interferometer ) , and tough and serious ( very realistic ) quantum - dynamical calculations implying determining the potential energy surfaces associated with the interaction between the diffracted particles and the diffracting gratings as a function of the distance ( e.g. , atom - atom , atom - molecule or molecule - molecule scattering processes ) .",
    "in a few words , by means of this procedure we have tried to _ make quantum mechanics less mystic _ , showing that a relatively complex dynamical process can be easily explained by means of a few working hypotheses and a simple model .",
