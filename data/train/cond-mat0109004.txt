    "more than 25 years ago , an unusual propagating sound - like ( @xmath5 ) carlson - goldman ( cg ) mode in _ charged _ superconducting systems with the velocity @xmath6 was discovered @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was a widespread opinion before the cg mode discovery that since in the charged systems the sound - like bogolyubov - anderson ( ba ) @xcite mode associated with _ neutral _ superconductors is converted to the plasma mode due to the anderson - higgs mechanism , there is no sound - like phase mode in charged systems .    a magnificent effort ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite ) was made to understand the mechanism , responsible for the appearance of the cg mode and its relation to other phenomena of non - equilibrium superconductivity . while the majority theories of the cg mode @xcite ) were essentially based on the kinetic equations which are usually derived using the quasi - classical green s functions , the paper by kulik , entin - wohlman , orbach @xcite used a more conventional approach based on the matsubara green s functions without kinetic equations .",
    "in the subsequent papers of takada with coauthors ( see @xcite and references therein ) the approach of @xcite was further developed and very recently applied for the case of @xmath0-wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the collective oscillations in @xmath0-wave superconductors were also studied using the kinetic equations for green s functions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the discovery of high-@xmath3 compounds , the @xmath7 superconductivity has attracted much attention @xcite and the claim of @xcite that the cg mode in clean @xmath0-wave superconductors may survive in a much wider region of temperatures down to @xmath8 appears to be very different from the established properties of the cg mode in @xmath1-wave superconductors , so that it is important to check it by an independent calculation .    on the other hand , the importance of phase fluctuations in high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) ( see , e.g. the review @xcite ) , stimulated interest in the derivation of the `` phase only '' effective actions from the microscopic theory .",
    "it is important to emphasize that although there is no commonly accepted theory of htsc , it seems reasonable that one can use a simple bcs - like approach to describe the properties of htsc below the critical temperature , @xmath3 even though such an approach fails above @xmath3 . relying on this argument the `` phase only '' actions for @xmath0-wave superconductors",
    "were recently derived in @xcite",
    ". however , the only phase excitations which are described by these actions are the ba mode in the _ neutral _ superconductor @xcite and the plasma mode @xcite which appears when the coulomb interaction is taken into account .",
    "this corresponds to the standard paradigm which does not yield the existence of the cg mode .",
    "thus the purpose of the present paper is to investigate which ingredient is missing in the treatments of @xcite , so that the cg mode does not appear in these approaches and to establish a link between the results of @xcite and the `` phase only '' action formalism .",
    "this missing link is established here and the cg mode is obtained within the effective action formalism .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "we extend the `` phase only ''",
    "effective action formalism for _ charged _ systems to incorporate the _ density - current _ coupling which was so far considered only using other methods @xcite ( see also @xcite , where the effect of this coupling appears to be important for the description of dirty superconductors ) . in neutral systems the density - current correlator _",
    "does contribute _ in so called _ landau terms _ of the effective action @xcite , so that the correct expression for these terms can only be obtained when this correlator is taken into account .",
    "we show that when the density - current coupling is included it becomes possible to obtain the cg mode using the `` phase only '' action .",
    "in particular , we derive an analytical expression for the pair susceptibility structure factor and solve numerically the equation for the cg mode velocity .",
    "we show the gauge independent character of the equation for the collective phase excitations one of the solutions of which is the cg mode . establishing a link between the pair susceptibility and this gauge independent equation for the phase excitations",
    "we argue that the peaks in the structure factor associated with the cg mode are independent of the choice of the gauge .",
    "the gauge independence of the equation for the cg mode used in the previous papers @xcite is also shown applying the identity derived recently in @xcite .",
    "we consider possible manifestations of the cg mode in the gauge independent density - density and current - current response functions .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the density - density , current - current and density - current polarization functions for 2d clean @xmath0-wave superconductor at @xmath9 .",

    "[ sec : action ] , we describe all details about the formalism used in the paper , necessary for further understanding . the various forms of the effective actions ( for the phase and electric potential , `` phase only '' and `` electric potential only '' ) are expressed in terms of density - density , current - current and density - current polarization functions in sec .

    "[ sec : omega ] we also discuss in detail the difference between the present and other @xcite approaches . in sec .",
    "[ sec : standard ] we briefly recall the properties of the phase excitations in the absence of the density - current coupling and stress some points like gauge independence of the equation for the collective phase excitations and the properties of the gauge independent density - density and current - current correlators which are particularly useful for better understanding of our main results which are presented in sec .

    "it has to be stressed that the _ minimal coupling _ prescription ( [ restore.field ] ) does not guaranty itself the gauge independence of the final result . the gauge independent treatment of the transformations ( [ gauge ] ) and ( [ phi.modulus.approx ] ) for @xmath0-wave pairing is , in particular , one of the complications @xcite . in the previous studies of the cg mode @xcite the phase field",

    "although , as will be discussed below , the final result obtained in the both methods agrees , the present method of the investigation of the cg mode is more transparent because it explicitly uses the gauge independent combinations of the fields over the whole derivation . for example",
