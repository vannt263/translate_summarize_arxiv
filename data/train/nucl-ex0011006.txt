    "single - pion photoproduction has been used extensively to explore the electromagnetic properties of nucleon resonances , and most determinations of the @xmath5 resonance couplings @xcite have been obtained through multipole analyses of this reaction .",
    "the study of @xmath6 properties , in general , has enjoyed a resurgence , driven by the growth of new facilities worldwide .",
    "many precise new measurements have focused on the photoproduction of pions and other pseudoscalar mesons , in the hope that they would reveal states not seen previously in the photoproduction and elastic scattering of pions .",
    "associated studies have suggested both new states and couplings to existing states which contradict those found in analyses of the full pion production database .",
    "these results demonstrate the influence of measurements sensitive to new quantities and suggest that older analyses may have been based on insufficient or flawed data sets .",
    "a survey of existing data in the 1  gev region shows most polarization measurements to have only one or two angular points at a given beam energy , often with rather large uncertainties .",
    "this allows a great deal of freedom in multipole analyses , and is clearly insufficient to pick out more than the strongest resonance signals .",
    "one quantity which has consistently influenced these new analyses is the beam polarization quantity @xmath0 .",
    "examples include the e2/m1 ratio @xcite , where new measurements of the differential cross section and @xmath0 changed this ratio by nearly a factor of two .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 in @xmath7 photoproduction were shown @xcite to be sensitive to the @xmath8 ratio of photo - decay amplitudes for the @xmath9 , implying a ratio very different from the pion photoproduction value .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 in kaon photoproduction has also proved @xcite to be crucial in determining the character of a bump seen in precise new total cross section measurements . in @xmath10 photoproduction",
    ", results for @xmath0 from graal have been used to argue for a change in the @xmath11 amplitude for the @xmath12 @xcite .    in this experiment , we have performed systematic measurements of the cross section asymmetry @xmath0 for the reaction @xmath13 @xcite simultaneously with measurements of compton scattering @xmath14 @xcite , over the energy range @xmath15 = 0.5 - 1.1gev and at pion cm angles @xmath16 .",
    "the experimental data ( 158 data points ) from @xmath1-meson photoproduction constitute the first systematic and high statistics measurement of @xmath0 for this reaction channel over the present kinematic region .",
    "preliminary results of the measurements have been presented in @xcite .    in sections  2 and 3 ,",
    "we describe the methods employed in this experiment , with special emphasis on the control of systematic errors . in section  4 , we describe how these measurements , and the recent measurements from graal @xcite , have effected the gw multipole analyses . comparisons to the mainz fits @xcite are also made .",
    "finally , in section  5 , we summarize our results .",
    "the experiment was carried out on the linearly polarized photon beam of the 4.5gev yerevan synchrotron .",
    "the same setup has been used for the parallel study of two reactions : compton scattering and photoproduction of @xmath17-meson off protons .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "the linearly polarized photon beam is generated by coherent bremsstrahlung ( cb ) of 3.03.5gev electrons on the internal @xmath18 m diamond crystal target .",
    "the beam has 23msec long pulses with a 50hz repetition rate and an intensity of about @xmath19 eq .",
    "photons / sec .",
    "the beam , shaped by a system of collimators and sweeping magnets , has a 10@xmath2010 mm size at the position ( @xmath21 ) of the liquid hydrogen target ( @xmath21 ) ( 9 cm in length ) .",
    "it is transported in a vacuum pipe to the wilson - type quantameter ( q ) .",
    "the energy spectrum is measured and controlled by a 30-channel pair spectrometer ps-30 ( energy resolution 12% ) @xcite .",
    "the whole range of bremsstrahlung energies are covered by 5 scans with respective current settings on the psm analyzing magnet .",
    "the full energy spectra of bremsstrahlung on amorphous and crystal targets , measured by the pair spectrometer ps-30 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .",
    "the recoil protons are detected by the magnetic spectrometer ( ms ) consisting of a doublet of quadrupole lenses ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , a bending magnet ( bm ) , a telescope of four scintillation trigger counters ( @xmath24 ) and a system of coordinate detectors , including a scintillation hodoscope ( @xmath25 ) and seven multiwire proportional chambers ( @xmath26 ) , allowing the reconstruction of momentum , azimuthal and polar angles of the outgoing proton .",
    "time - of - flight measurements were carried out between @xmath27 and @xmath28 counters on a flight base of 9  m for particle identification ( p,@xmath29 ) .",
    "the ms covered a solid angle of @xmath30 , and its angular and momentum resolutions were @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the incident photon energy and the cm scattering angle were reconstructed on average with an accuracy of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with corresponding acceptances of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 decay photons were detected by the @xmath38erenkov spectrometer ( @xmath39 ) consisting of a veto counter ( v ) , a lead converter ( pb ) , scintillation hodoscope ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 and @xmath42 coordinate analysis , trigger counter ( t ) , and a lead glass @xmath43erenkov counter of full absorption ( @xmath44 ) . the energy resolution of the @xmath43erenkov counter could be parameterized as @xmath45 without converter and @xmath46 with converter ( e being the photon energy in gev ) .",
    "the kinematics of the analyzed process was completely determined by defining the kinematic parameters of the proton in the magnetic spectrometer . for identification of the process @xmath47 , the protons in the magnetic spectrometer were detected in coincidence with the photon detection branch .",
    "the coordinate detectors of the @xmath43erenkov spectrometer were in addition used for correlation analysis between two detecting branches to identify the low rate yield of the compton scattering process @xcite .",
    "an independent experimental study was carried out to check the reconstruction accuracy in the magnetic spectrometer ( ms ) @xcite .",
    "monte carlo calculations , intended to estimate the influence of different possible factors on the reconstruction precision , indicate that inaccuracies in setting the positions , angles and fields of magnetic elements , poor quality of track reconstruction in @xmath48 , additional multiple scattering in materials not taken into account , influence equally the reconstruction accuracy of both the interaction vertex and the scattering angles in ms .",
    "therefore , an experimental study of the vertex position reconstruction accuracy was defined as an effective test of the characteristics of the ms , and was easily carried out by means of a point - like target .",
    "good agreement between the experimental results for vertex reconstruction and monte carlo calculations ( fig.[f3 ] ) provides reliable support for the performance of our proton detection branch within designed precisions .",
    "finally , the possibility to treat compton scattering data @xcite , despite significant difficulties caused by the physical background process of @xmath1 photoproduction with approximately two orders of magnitude higher cross section , and with practically the same kinematic parameters , also points to a reliable operation of the detection system within designed accuracies .",
    "during the measurements , several factors were considered to minimize the influence of systematic uncertainties .",
    "a particular emphasis has been placed on maintaining the stability of the coherent peak position . in the case of its deviation ,",
    "the event registration was paused , until respective correction procedure was made .",
    "such checks of the coherent peak were carried out every 4050sec . in fig.[f4 ] , the measured peak region is presented , superimposed on the full coherent bremsstrahlung spectrum , for the cases with correct and distorted peak position .",
    "a possible influence on the asymmetry results from instabilities in subsystems was compensated by periodical alternating the orientation of the photon beam polarization during the measurement of the same kinematic point . also , during data acquisition the trigger rates , efficiencies of the coordinate detectors , distributions of kinematic variables were controlled .",
    "hardware and software of all these control procedures was realized through the camac standard .",
    "fiber optic lines were used to manage the current of the pair spectrometer magnet ( psm ) and the electronics of the ms trigger , placed immediately on the ms .    during the off - line analysis , prior to the reconstruction step , the time - of - flight measurements between @xmath27 and @xmath28 were analyzed , and the events with a proton candidate in ms were selected ( fig.[f5 ] ) .",
    "a soft cut was made , mainly at low energies , on the energy response of the @xmath38erenkov detector , to reduce the contribution of accidental coincidences and multiparticle events resulting from the energetic part of the coherent bremsstrahlung spectrum @xcite .",
    "then , the selected events were sent for reconstruction of the kinematic parameters of proton and the kinematics of the event .    within further selection , the interaction point in the target was reconstructed and events falling out of the target limits by more than one standard deviation are cut .",
    "the yield of the @xmath49 reaction was defined from the number of selected events in the time spectrum of start - stop measurements between two detection branches ( fig.[f6 ] ) , by fitting and subtracting the respective number of background events in the peak region .",
    "several corrections were applied to compensate for the contribution of various factors .",
    "the results from the analysis of compton scattering process were used to correct for the influence of that source .",
    "further corrections were applied , compensating for the rate reductions due to the dead time of data acquisition and efficiency of different subdetectors .",
    "the maximum trigger rates was about 5event / sec , and the dead time did not exceed 10% .",
    "another insignificant contribution , resulting from the empty target cell , was measured separately and amounted to @xmath501% .",
    "the background @xmath51 rate is mainly dominated with double pion production processes generated by the high energy tail of cb spectrum .",
    "this background contribution has been determined in additional measurements , such as :    * @xmath51rate dependence on the coherent peak energy of the cb spectrum at fixed kinematics of the setup , allowing the significant variation in the relative yield of single and multiple pion production processes . * the @xmath51rate dependence on the @xmath52photon decay angle .",
    "the data obtained were then compared with results of monte carlo calculations .",
    "the contribution of background processes was estimated to be less than 5% .",
    "calculations of the polarization of the cb spectra were realized by a solution of integral equations for intensity and polarization of the coherent spectra @xcite . in the energy range of the measurements , the photon beam , polarization ranged from 50% to 70% .",
    "the cross section asymmetry @xmath0 of the reaction @xmath53 is defined as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the polarization of photon beam and @xmath56 are the normalized yields for the photons polarized perpendicular and parallel to the reaction plane .",
    "the systematic errors of the measurements were dominated mainly by the accuracy of the linear polarization calculations .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath57 have been evaluated to be within @xmath58 in full energy range and are included in the errors of the experimental data .",
    "the possible shift in the reconstructed photon energies was calculated from the uncertainty in the ms optics and did not exceed 0.4% . finally , overall systematic uncertainty for each energy set did not exceed 3% .",
    "it is also important to note , that most kinematic bins were formed from at least two independent data samples collected at different kinematic settings of the detector .",
    "the final asymmetry was calculated from the corresponding results in such overlapping bins . on the other hand , comparison of the results on such equivalent bins , produced from different event samples , with different acceptance conditions and polarized incident photons from different parts of the cb spectrum , provided a good check for systematic uncertainties in the obtained results .",
    "our data for the asymmetry @xmath0 , in the kinematic range @xmath15 = 0.5 @xmath59 1.1gev and @xmath60 , are presented in table1 .",
    "some of the measured energy and angular distributions are shown in figs.[f7 ] @xmath59 [ f9 ] together with the experimental data of other groups @xcite and predictions of different phenomenological analyses @xcite .",
    "the most systematic measurements of @xmath0 for @xmath49 , over the resonance region , exist for the angle @xmath61 ( fig.[f7]a ) . from fig.[f7]a ,",
    "one can see , as a whole , a good agreement between the values of prior measurements and our present results .",
    "near 900  mev , our data disagree with data from mit @xcite and some early slac @xcite measurements , but are in good agreement with later measurements from another slac group @xcite .",
    "our points are also consistent with the results of this group for the angle ( fig .",
    "[ f8]b ) . from fig.[f9 ] , it is seen that our results for the angular distributions at @xmath15 = 700 , 750 , and 800  mev are in agreement with the existing data as well .    in figs.[f7 ]",
    "@xmath59 [ f9 ] , the experimental data are also compared with the predictions of phenomenological analyses from the mainz @xcite and gw @xcite groups .",
    "while both analyses reproduce the qualitative behavior of @xmath0 , a shape discrepancy is noticeable in the gw fit .",
    "the main difference between multipole analyses and experiment is observed above @xmath15 = 700  mev where there have been few previous measurements .",
    "inclusion of our data in the gw fit results in an improved description , but shape differences remain .",
    "the mainz fit appears to have a shape more consistent with the data .",
    "( it should be noted that some of the older fits , in particular the fit of ref .",
    "@xcite , predict a shape consistent with the mainz result . )",
    "it is interesting to compare these results to those recently published by the graal collaboration @xcite . in that work ,",
    "a similar comparison was made for @xmath0 measurements in the reaction @xmath62 .",
    "there a deviation from gw predictions was noted in the 800 @xmath59 1000  mev range , at backward angles . it was suggested that this discrepancy could be removed by a change in the n(1650 ) photo - decay amplitude ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we have examined the graal angular distribution at 950  mev ( @xmath63 = 1630  mev ) and agree that a change ( reduction ) in the @xmath64 multipole can account for the shape difference . here too , for neutral pion production and energies near 900  mev , a reduction of this multipole in fa00 by about 20% ( in modulus ) results in an improved description .",
    "a reduction of the same amount is found in comparing the energy - dependent and single - energy solutions .",
    "the effect is displayed in fig.[f10 ] .",
    "note that this modification to the gw fit , while improving the agreement with data , actually worsens the agreement with the mainz prediction at the most backward angles .",
    "the obtained data on cross section asymmetry ( @xmath0 ) are in good agreement with existing experimental data and in at least qualitative agreement with phenomenological predictions @xcite . we have found evidence in support of the graal claim that some discrepancies with previous gw analyses could be linked to the @xmath64 multipole and possibly the n(1650 ) resonance contribution .",
    "it will be useful to have a mainz fit including these data in order to isolate differences with the gw fits .",
    "a set of fits employing identical data sets would also be useful in determining whether differences are due to the chosen formalism or data constraints .",
    "work along this line is in progress @xcite .    in summary , results of present experiment on @xmath0 asymmetry",
    "have significantly improved the existing data base in the second and third resonance regions .",
    "forthcoming measurements of cross section and polarization observables in the photoproduction of mesons ( jlab @xcite , graal @xcite ) , may lead to more successful determinations of the underlying scattering amplitudes and a more precise determination of resonance photocouplings .",
    "the yerphi group is indebted to the synchrotron staff and cryogenic service for reliable operation during the experiment .",
