    "<S> @xmath28 obeys a rg equation identical to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath41 in @xmath28 , @xmath16 is a parameter of the theory , not a regulator . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath28 is in general complicated . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath44 is a function of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> a strategy based on the bootstrap program for scattering amplitudes  @xcite is proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to compute @xmath44 , which we briefly recall below . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the one and two - loop coefficients @xmath43 are written in terms of classical and nielsen s polylogarithms with argument @xmath46 . a crucial observation made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that the same results can be written in terms of harmonic polylogarithms  ( hpl ) @xmath47  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with weight indices drawn from the set @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the available one and two - loop data , the leftmost and the rightmost index of the weight vectors were found to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the rightmost index has to be @xmath50 , because the two cusp points of the wilson loops are separated by euclidean distance for @xmath51 , and no branch cut is expected . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the condition on the leftmost - index comes empirically from the observation of the one- and two - loop results ; as we will show below , this condition breaks down at three loops in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , for now we proceed with the empirical ansatz for @xmath52-loop fully differential soft function proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is a linear combination of hpls with undetermined rational coefficients , and whose weight vectors obey the leftmost- and rightmost - index conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the undetermined coefficients of the hpls can then be fixed by performing an expansion around @xmath53 , together with the constraint that rapidity divergence is only a single logarithmic divergence at each order for the expansion coefficients in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the @xmath54 limit of @xmath28 is smooth , and the expansion is simply a taylor series in @xmath46 . as explained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the leading @xmath55 term of the expansion reproduces the threshold soft function  @xcite , while the coefficient of @xmath56 can be obtained by inserting a numerator @xmath57 into the integrand of the threshold soft function , where @xmath58 is the total momenta of real radiation from the time - ordered wilson loop . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using integration - by - parts  ( ibp ) identities  @xcite , integrals with high rank numerator insertion can be reduced to a small number of master integrals , which have been computed for other purpose recently  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the strategy outlined above is straightforward , it has two caveats . </S>",
    "<S> first , the maximal weight of hpls at three loops for massless perturbation theory is @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the number of coefficients need to be fixed is @xmath60 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to insert a high - rank numerator @xmath61 into the integrand of threshold soft function in order to have enough data to fix the coefficients , which is unfortunately beyond the ability of the tools for ibp reduction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , it is not clear whether the conjectured sets of function in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is sufficient to describe the three - loop soft function . to circumvent the above difficulties , we first perform the calculation for soft wilson loops whose matter content  @xcite resembles those of @xmath62 supersymmetric yang - mills theory  ( sym ) </S>",
    "<S> this has a number of advantages :    it has been observed that for soft wilson loops in scet  @xcite , the results in @xmath62 sym has uniform degrees of transcendentality with transcendental weight @xmath63 at @xmath52 loops . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath62 results match the maximal - weight part of the corresponding qcd results . </S>",
    "<S> similar phenomenon was first observed for anomalous dimension of twist - two operator for wilson lines  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also holds for some other quantities , e.g. , perturbative form factor  @xcite . assuming that this is also true in our current calculation , by calculating @xmath28 in @xmath62 sym first </S>",
    "<S> , we should automatically obtain the maximal - weight part of @xmath28 in qcd ;    since the @xmath62 sym results have uniform degrees of transcendentality , there are only @xmath64 coefficients to be fixed at three loops , which can be achieved within the current computation power ;    the remaining parts of the qcd result have transcendental weight lower than @xmath59 , therefore only requires @xmath65 coefficients to be fixed . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , since the feynman diagrams corresponding to the lower - weight part have less complicated analytical structure , they can be computed by brute force . </S>",
    "<S> direct calculation can also test the completeness of the ansatz . and </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that although the ansatz remain complete for the three - loop @xmath62 sym result , it fails for the three - loop qcd one . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , for qcd result , a brute - force calculation for the terms proportional to @xmath66 is possible using the method of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the result for @xmath66 terms indicates which set of functions we should add to the existing ansatz .    </S>",
    "<S> the full results , for both @xmath62 sym and qcd , are presented in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> * results . * </S>",
    "<S> we first present the results for @xmath28 in @xmath62 sym . </S>",
    "<S> we only give the results at the initial scale , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the full scale dependence can be inferred from eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the one and two - loop coefficients can be found in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we have used the shorthand notation for the hpls  @xcite and neglected the argument @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that each term in eq .   has uniform sign and integer coefficient </S>",
