    "most , if not all , astrophysical systems rotate and it is conceivable that vorticity can play an important role in a number of situations .",
    "so far , however , the majority of the related studies has been confined to relatively small - scale systems . although the question of universal rotation and how large this may be has been posed more than once ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) , in cosmology the role of vorticity is usually bypassed .",
    "one of the reasons for doing so is that typical inflationary scenarios are irrotational , since the vacuum fluctuations do not generate vorticity  @xcite .",
    "another , is that linear rotational perturbations are known to decay as the inverse square of the cosmological scale factor , which implies strong dilution for any vortex - like distortions that could happen to exist .",
    "dissipative effects during the subsequent radiation era , like silk damping and neutrino free - streaming , may also have a negative impact on large - scale rotation , though ( to the best of our knowledge ) studies of this nature are not yet available in the literature .",
    "in cosmology , where the terms vorticity and rotation are used interchangeably , vorticity is usually generated from nonlinear effects .",
    "this is one additional reason for not taking vorticity into account in many cosmological perturbation studies .",
    "inhomogeneous non - barotropic ( e.g. , non - adiabatic ) media , for example , can generate rotation at the second perturbative level  @xcite , and so can fluid viscosity  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , resorting to nonlinear effects is not always necessary , since there are agents that can induce rotation still at the linear level .",
    "for instance , a coherent magnetic field ( ` @xmath0-field ' ) can act as a source of cosmic vorticity  @xcite .",
    "the opposite is also theoretically possible .",
    "thus , following  @xcite , a number of authors have explored the likelihood that rotational distortions can lead to cosmic magnetogenesis ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , both the fluid viscosity and the @xmath0-field can affect the evolution of rotational perturbations and thus change the standard picture , which usually assumes non - magnetized , perfect media . therefore , in principle at least ,",
    "the effects of the aforementioned sources could lead to more residual vorticity than previously anticipated .",
    "the present paper uses newtonian gravity to study the effects of viscosity and those of a magnetic field on rotation .",
    "we adopt the covariant , lagrangian approach to fluid dynamics , which has been proved helpful in several ( mainly relativistic ) cosmological studies ( see  @xcite for an introduction to the newtonian version of the formalism ) .",
    "first , we look into the effects of fluid viscosity and then consider those of a coherent magnetic field . our results ,",
    "confirm those of earlier studies claiming that both of the aforementioned agents can act as sources of cosmic rotation .",
    "we show , in particular , that viscosity can only generate vorticity in media with an inhomogeneous density distribution .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath0-field , which does not ( in principle at least ) require the presence of density perturbations . assuming the newtonian analogue of the einstein - de sitter universe as our background model",
    ", we find that viscosity can only generate vorticity at second order .",
    "magnetism , on the other hand , can do the same at the linear perturbative level .",
    "moreover , the irreducible decomposition of variables and equations that the covariant formalism introduces , allows us to identify the agents leading to vorticity generation , as well as the way they do so .",
    "viscosity , for example , sources rotational distortions via the coupling of the shear with certain types of density perturbations . alternatively , the magnetic field acts primarily through the tension component of the lorentz force .",
    "our next step is to investigate how viscous and/or magnetized media can affect the linear evolution of rotational perturbations . in the first case , we find that viscosity always leads to vorticity dissipation , though the effects are generally scale dependent .",
    "we identify , in particular , a characteristic length beyond which viscosity is essentially negligible and below which its role becomes progressively more important .",
    "in particular , well inside this `` viscous scale '' vorticity dissipates very quickly , while far beyond that scale the fluid kinematics are dominated by the background hubble expansion .",
    "there , one recovers the standard inverse - square decay law for rotational perturbations .",
    "the size of the aforementioned viscous scale depends on the specifics of the cosmic fluid , such as the average velocity and the mean free - path of the species involved .",
    "when dealing with non - relativistic matter , however , the typical domain affected by viscosity is very small ( in cosmological terms ) .",
    "in contrast to viscosity , the presence of magnetic fields seems to have a favorable effect on linear rotational perturbations .",
    "in addition to generating vorticity at the linear order , the @xmath0-field slows down the standard decay rate of rotation in perturbed friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universes .",
    "as mentioned earlier , vorticity typically depletes as @xmath1 , with @xmath2 representing the cosmological scale factor .",
    "when the linear magnetic effects are accounted for , however , the vorticity decay - rate changes to @xmath3 .",
    "the implication of this effect , which comes entirely from the magnetic tension , is that magnetized universes , can have more residual vorticity than their non - magnetic counterparts .",
    "an analogous , conclusion was also reached indirectly , through the relativistic analysis of linear density inhomogeneities in magnetized cosmologies  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first direct indication that magnetism `` favors '' both the generation and the survival of cosmic rotation .",
    "consider a self - gravitating newtonian medium and a velocity field @xmath4 , tangent to the flow lines of the fluid .",

    "the shear , on the other hand , describes changes in the element s shape ( under constant volume ) and @xmath13 defines the local rotational axis .    the above defined variables",
    "obey a set of three evolution and three constraint equations that fully determine the fluid kinematics .",

    "we also note the vector @xmath22 , which is the sum of the inertial and gravitational acceleration ( @xmath23 is the gravitational potential ) and vanishes in the absence of non - inertial or non - gravitational forces.)([dotomega ] ) and takes the form @xmath24 in our notation , with @xmath25 representing the laplacian operator . ]",
    "finally , the tensor @xmath26 describes the tidal part of the gravitational field .",
    "expressions ( [ ray])([dotomega ] ) are supplemented by an equal number of constraint equations .",
    "these relate the gradients of the key kinematic variables and are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29by definition  @xcite .",
    "the sets ( [ ray])([dotomega ] ) and ( [ con1])([con2 ] ) monitor the kinematics between two neighboring flow lines . to close",
    "the system one also needs the continuity equation , which reflects mass conservation and in our case is @xmath30 together with the momentum - conservation formula .",
    "the exact form of the latter depends on the type ( i.e.  on the equation of state ) of the matter and on the presence of additional sources .",
    "newtonian cosmology is expected to provide a good approximation of the post - recombination universe and on scales well inside the hubble radius , where one can safely ignore the role of spacetime curvature . in newtonian gravity ,",
    "the relativistic frw universes are represented by models where the fundamental observers move along parabolic , elliptical and hyperbolic trajectories .",
    "these flow lines correspond to euclidean ( flat ) , spherical ( closed ) and hyperbolic ( open ) spatial geometry respectively .",
    "given the homogeneity and isotropy of the friedmann universes , the only nonzero variables are scalars that depend solely on time .",
    "vectors , tensors and spatial gradients vanish identically .",
    "thus , the newtonian analogue of a dust - dominated , flat frw cosmology ( i.e.  of the einstein - de sitter universe ) is monitored by the set @xmath31 and @xmath32 these relations are respectively known as the friedmann , the raychaudhuri and the continuity equations .",
    "note that @xmath33 is the hubble parameter , with @xmath2 representing the cosmological scale factor .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 in all frw cosmologies .",
    "it is then relatively straightforward to show that ( [ n1]b ) and ( [ n2 ] ) are the einstein - de sitter limits of ( [ ray ] ) and ( [ cont ] ) respectively .",
    "friedmann s equation , on the other hand , is simply an integral of ( [ n1]b ) .",
    "the system of ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) can be solved analytically with respect to time , leading to @xmath35 which offer an alternative description of the einstein - de sitter universe . in the following sections",
    ", we will consider linear rotational perturbations around such a background , and study their evolution in the presence of fluid viscosity or a magnetic field .",
    "the rotational evolution of a self - gravitating newtonian fluid is governed by eq .",
    "( [ dotomega ] ) , which determines the twist between two neighboring flow lines .",
    "note the first and the last terms on the right - hand side of that relation .",
    "these describe effects triggered by the relative motion of the fluid particles , analogous to those attributed to the coriolis force  @xcite .",
    "the second term , on the other hand , reflects the presence of non - inertial and non - gravitational forces ( e.g.  those triggered by pressure gradients , the presence of electromagnetic fields , etc ) and is determined by the associated navier - stokes equation . in the case of a ( non - magnetized ) viscous fluid , the latter reads  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the isotropic pressure and @xmath38 is the anisotropic pressure of the matter ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "taking the `` curl '' of the above and then substituting into expression ( [ dotomega ] ) provides an evolution formula that monitors the rotational behavior of a newtonian viscous medium .",
    "fluid viscosity can be expressed in terms of kinematic ( shear ) viscosity via the phenomenological relation @xmath41 with @xmath42 representing the kinematic viscosity coefficient and @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the latter immediately implies that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 defines the magnitude of the anisotropic pressure tensor .",

    "\\label{vdotomega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the above , in the absence of viscosity , the only way of generating vorticity is through the baroclinic ( the second ) term on the right - hand side of ( [ vdotomega ] ) .",
    "the latter vanishes when @xmath48 , namely in the case of a barotropic medium .",
    "the viscous nature of the fluid , on the other hand , can act as a source of rotation by exploiting the coupling between the density and the shear gradients .",
    "analogous conclusions have also been reached in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , after removing the baroclinic term and taking into account the difference in the definition of the vorticity vector , one can show that expression ( [ vdotomega ] ) is identical to eq .",
    "( 1 ) in  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the viscous source - term in the right - hand side of ( [ vdotomega ] ) , the significance of which means that it deserves further attention . recalling that @xmath49 and using constraint ( [ con1]b ) , a straightforward calculation leads to the expression ( see",

    "according to the above , the source term is not entirely rotation - free , implying that only a part of it can actually generate vorticity .",
    "also , @xmath51 and @xmath52 by definition .",
    "following  @xcite , the former describes the density contrast between two neighboring fluid flow lines , while the latter monitors changes ( under constant volume ) in the shape of an inhomogeneous density distribution ( e.g.  from spherical symmetry to that of an ellipsoidal , etc ) .",
    "note that , in contrast to @xcite , here both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not dimensionless .",

    "all these have only temporal dependence .",
    "physical quantities that vanish in the background , but have nonzero perturbed value , like the vorticity , the viscous pressure , the shear and all the spatial gradients , are treated as first - order ( linear ) perturbations .",
    "note that differentiating perturbations does not affect their perturbative order .",
    "finally , products between linear quantities are of higher - order and are therefore neglected . ] @xmath55 since @xmath56 in the background .",
    "the above implies that , within the limits of the linear approximation , viscosity can no longer generate vorticity , though it has an effect on pre - existing rotation . according to ( [ edsvdotomega ] ) , in the absence of viscous pressure ,",
    "the vorticity evolution is determined by the background expansion only . in that case",
    ", we recover the standard decay - rate of @xmath57 , since @xmath58 in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the introduction of a viscous fluid , however , will generally change the standard picture .",
    "it is also worth noting that expression ( [ edsvdotomega ] ) looks like the `` heat - transfer equation '' , with an extra term due to the universal expansion and the viscosity coefficient ( @xmath42 ) playing the role of the thermal diffusivity .",
    "to proceed , we introduce the harmonic splitting @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . then , eq .  ( [ edsvdotomega ] )",
    "recasts into @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the comoving wavenumber of the vorticity mode .",
    "hence , qualitatively speaking , viscosity enhances the diluting role of the expansion and leads to less residual vorticity .",

    "see  ( [ eds ] ) , we arrive at @xmath65 with the zero suffix indicating a given time during the evolution .",
    "clearly , at sufficiently late times the last term on the right - hand side of the above becomes negligible and the viscosity effects fade away .",

    "sufficiently small scales are strongly affected by viscosity and there vorticity dissipates quickly . on larger wavelengths , however , rotational distortions can survive for long . there",

    "the scale dependence of the dissipative viscous effects is a key feature of solution ( [ vomega ] ) , because it determines their domain of influence and strength .",

    "the effect of fluid viscosity , with respect to the scale of the rotational distortion at different times , is plotted in fig .",

    "clearly , the dissipative effect of viscosity on modes that remained inside the viscous scale for long ( i.e.  those with @xmath90 initially ) is very strong , leaving no residual vorticity for all practical purposes .",
    "finally , we should also note that , in analogy to silk - damping  @xcite , viscous dissipation could potentially affect scales considerably larger than @xmath93 . investigating",
    "whether and how this happens , however , goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "<S> we study the role of viscosity and the effects of a magnetic field on a rotating , self - gravitating fluid , using newtonian theory and adopting the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm that viscosity can generate vorticity in inhomogeneous environments , while the magnetic tension can produce vorticity even in the absence of fluid pressure and density gradients . </S>",
    "<S> linearizing our equations around an einstein - de sitter cosmology , we find that viscosity adds to the diluting effect of the universal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> typically , however , the dissipative viscous effects are confined to relatively small scales . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify the characteristic length bellow which the viscous dissipation is strong and beyond which viscosity is essentially negligible . in contrast , magnetism seems to favor cosmic rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic presence is found to slow down the standard decay - rate of linear vortices , thus leading to universes with more residual rotation than generally anticipated . </S>"
