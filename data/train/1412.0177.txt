    "it is known that many reactions important for nuclear astrophysics proceed through subthreshold bound states and lower - lying resonance states above the threshold and the single - channel approach can be applied to describe these states . to calculate the rate of such reactions , we need to find the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) of the radial wave function for bound and resonance states .",
    "the anc method has been explored as an indirect experimental method for the determination of the cross sections of peripheral reactions at low energy @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to determine the bound states anc from experimental data ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently the effective - range expansion method has been developed to find the anc for bound and resonant states from an elastic scattering phase shift analysis ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we note that a sufficiently precise measurement of elastic scattering can give crucial information concerning the anc .",
    "however , finding the anc for a resonance is more difficult than for a bound state .",
    "it was shown earlier that for narrow resonances the anc is proportional to the square root of the width @xmath8 of the resonance considered @xcite .",
    "it is known that the normalization procedure for the gamow wave function of a resonance , particularly in the case of a broad resonance when one can not apply the zeldovich s formula @xcite , is difficult because the outgoing wave increases exponentially due to the complex momentum .    however , having the anc , we know the asymptotic part of the wave function which allows us to normalize it correctly if we choose a nuclear potential of the interaction between the two nuclei considered , thus describing the resonant state .",
    "the problem of the exponential increase of the gamow resonance wave function in the asymptotic region can be solved by using a complex scaling method based on the so - called abc - theorem @xcite .",
    "this method can be applied to charged particles as well ( see , for example , @xcite ) because the coulomb potential satisfies the scaling condition of the abc - theorem .",
    "the complex scaling method using the zeldovich s formula appears quite widely in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , the application of this method to a numerical normalization of the gamow wave function is rather difficult . in @xcite",
    "the problem of calculating the resonance pole was solved using similar @xmath0-matrix pole approach but for a potential model , unlike in our present work .",
    "usually @xmath9-matrix theory is applied to define the parameters of low - lying resonances and to describe nuclear resonance reactions .",
    "one of the shortcomings of this theory is the need to fix a value of the channel radius , which is impossible to measure experimentally .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop a theory based on the general properties of the scattering or reaction amplitudes , which can be used for an analytical continuation to the nonphysical riemann energy surface .",
    "we would like to point out that knowing the parameters of low - lying isolated resonances ( in particular the anc values ) allows us to predict accurately the crucial reaction rates for nuclear astrophysics .",
    "as we mentioned above , the application of the analytic properties of the @xmath0-matrix makes it easy to link the anc to the width @xmath8 of an isolated narrow resonance @xcite .",
    "however , this relationship is not valid for a wide resonance . in this section ,",

    "thus the total phase shift is @xmath34 the amplitude ( [ amp ] ) has a complicated analytical property in the complex momentum plane due to the coulomb factor .",

    "( [ s - mat ] ) .",
    "but we should note that the coulomb interaction leads to an essential singularity at zero energy and also ( see @xcite ) to an infinite number of poles of @xmath42 in addition to the poles of a purely nuclear nature .    in the vicinity of the pole @xmath43 , the partial scattering amplitude ( [ fl ] ) can be represented as @xmath44 where the function @xmath45 is regular at the point @xmath43 .    the simple derivation of the residue @xmath46 leads to the expression @xmath47= -\\frac{k_ie^{i2\\nu_l(k_r)}}{k_0\\rho_l(k_r)}.\\ ] ] according to the definition of the nuclear vertex constant @xmath48 ( nvc ) ,",
    "@xcite the relationship between nvc and the residue @xmath46 can be written as @xmath49 so we get @xmath50 using the relationship between nvc @xmath48 and anc @xmath51 @xcite , we obtain @xmath52 the derived equations are valid for both narrow and broad resonances . for narrow resonances , when @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , one can simplify eq .",

    "the point @xmath62 denotes a centered point , and the radius of convergence should be shorter than the distance from the centered point to the closest singular point .",
    "the last can be due to an exchange feynman diagram for the elastic scattering , leading to the logarithmic singularity which is absent in our model .    if we wish to determine the value of the phase shift @xmath30 by applying eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) at a point on the complex plane close to the centered point @xmath62 , then only the first few items of the convergent series for calculating @xmath30 can be taken into account with certain precision .",

    "the @xmath6 and @xmath5 nuclei are interesting in that the ground and first excited states are resonance states which can be treated as single - channel systems . the phase shift of the elastic @xmath83 scattering with total angular momentum and parity equal to @xmath84 passes rapidly through @xmath85 and therefore leads to a narrow resonance .",
    "however , the phase shift of the elastic @xmath83 scattering with @xmath86 does not pass through @xmath85 and therefore the corresponding resonance is wide enough .",
    "this fact leads to certain difficulties , not only in determining the position of the resonance and its width , but also in finding such characteristics as the nvc and anc .",
    "the coefficient values of the effective - range expansion obtained from a phase shift analysis of the elastic scattering data in the region up to 3 mev for neutron and 5 mev for proton were found by the authors of ref .",

    "agreement of the phase shifts calculated in @xcite with the experimental ones is good for the narrow @xmath3 resonance but is poor for the broad @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the n / d method was applied in @xcite for calculating the values of the parameters of these resonances .",
    "additionally , the residues @xmath46 of the renormalized scattering amplitude were calculated at the resonance poles in the complex @xmath11 plane using the effective - range method in @xcite .",

    "readers can see that these results for the energy and width coincide when the resonance is narrow , but there are essential differences for broad resonances ( in particular for states @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "the values of the renormalized nvcs ( @xmath93 ) and ancs ( @xmath51 ) , which were found by using our calculated values of the energies , widths and the nonresonant phase shifts are shown in the next two columns . in the last column",
    "the values of ancs ( @xmath94 ) which were calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ narrow ] ) , are presented .",
    "we note that these values are found at real momentum values .",
    "as the experimental phase shifts are determined with some uncertainties , it is reasonable to assess the change of nvc and anc as functions of the resonance energy and width .",
    "therefore , we calculated the value of the nonresonant phase shift @xmath95 and found the values of nvc and anc at the resonance point for the state @xmath96 , fixing the resonance energy and width fitted by @xmath9-matrix method @xcite .",
    "it was found that the differences in energy and resonance were 2.5% and 6.4% respectively , while the renormalized nvc and anc differ by 2.9% and 5.3% respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the percentage difference of the nvc and anc values is a consequence of the calculation of anc through the value nvc , because it is multiplied by the @xmath18 function at the different values of the coulomb factor .",
    "one can see that the uncertainties of nvc and anc are roughly the same as those of the resonance energy value . for narrow resonances",
    ", it is quite reasonable to evaluate anc using eq .",
    "( [ narrow ] ) , taking the value of the nonresonant phase shift for the real values of energy or momentum from the experimental data .",
    "it is obvious that for broad resonances the width of which is greater than their energy , the uncertainty of the anc value should be related to the uncertainty of the width which is determined by fitting the experimental scattering phase shifts .",
    "the effective - range method is not able to reproduce the widths of the @xmath2 resonances .",
    "this may be due to the single - channel approximation which we use in this work .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix pole prescription [ eq .",
    "( [ s - mat ] ) ] and expansion of the nonresonant phase to series [ eq . ( [ series ] ) ]",
    "give consistent resonance parameters for the ground and first excited states of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as for the low - lying states of @xmath2 situated above the @xmath7 threshold in spite of their resonance widths .",
    "the standard expansion of the effective - range function @xmath73 to find the nvc @xmath48 and other parameters of the two first resonance states of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are used successfully .",
    "we have found results which are a little different from those obtained by other methods used . in our opinion , these differences can be explained by the fact that in the first method , a centered point of the expansion of the nonresonant phase shift to a series is the point which is closest to the position of the resonance , while in the method of the effective range , we use a centered point of the expansion at zero momentum , which is far from the resonance pole .    in the case of a bound state , the binding energy can be considered as an additional parameter unlike in the @xmath0-matrix method with the phase shift fitting .",
    "therefore , we expect that the method using the @xmath0-matrix pole prescription [ eq .",
    "( [ s - mat ] ) ] can lead to quite different results , and so we recommend using the @xmath0-pole prescription to specify resonance parameters . at the same time",
    ", the effective - range expansion method in the convergence energy region is applicable in the case of a bound state when the the @xmath0-matrix pole prescription does not work .",
