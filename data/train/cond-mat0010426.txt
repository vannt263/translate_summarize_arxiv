    "the stochastic behavior displayed by spectra and wave functions of quantum many ",
    "body systems ( atoms , molecules , atomic nuclei , quantum dots ) is usually modelled in terms of canonical random  matrix theory ( rmt ) ; the application of rmt to such systems has been very successful in many cases @xcite . at the same time , this type of modelling is not completely realistic : all many ",
    "body systems that occur in nature are effectively governed by one and two  body forces , while the use of canonical rmt is tantamount to assuming many  body forces between the constituents . indeed , assuming that the one and two  body interaction can be modelled stochastically",
    ", one finds that the resulting number of independent random variables is much smaller than in rmt .",
    "for instance , the number of independent two  body matrix elements in a shell  model calculation in atoms or nuclei is typically much smaller than the dimension @xmath9 of the matrices involved , while the number of independent random variables in rmt is of order @xmath10 .",
    "this poses the question whether a more realistic stochastic modelling of many ",
    "body systems might yield results which differ from rmt predictions .",
    "the question was addressed in the 1970 s with the help of numerical simulations using matrices of fairly small dimensions .",
    "the main results were : in a certain limit , the average level density does not have the shape of a semicircle but is gaussian ; the ensembles are neither stationary nor ergodic ; unfolding of the spectra yields wigner  dyson spectral fluctuation properties , see refs .",
    "@xcite to @xcite .",
    "interest in model hamiltonians with random two  body interactions has resurged in recent years in several areas of many  body physics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite to @xcite ) , and the question of possible further differences between such models and rmt has resurfaced .",
    "the paradigmatic models for this type of question are the @xmath2body embedded gaussian random ensembles egoe(@xmath2 ) and egue(@xmath2 ) introduced by mon and french in 1975 @xcite and fully defined below .",
    "the integer @xmath2 takes any value between @xmath11 and @xmath0 , the total number of particles . a number of useful and interesting results for these ensembles",
    "have been obtained @xcite . in particular , it was shown that in the dilute limit ( number @xmath0 of fermions small in comparison with the number @xmath12 of single  particle states ) and for @xmath13 , the shape of the average spectrum is gaussian ( rather than a semicircle as in the case of rmt ) . however",
    ", a comprehensive analytical approach to the spectral fluctuation properties of these ensembles is still lacking .",
    "to quote from ref .",
    "@xcite : `` ... there is no real theory yet for egoe fluctuations , the gap being one of the most significant ones in the entire subject '' .",
    "as far as we know , the situation has not changed in the last twenty years .",
    "the gap is due to the fact that , in contrast to rmt , the embedded ensembles do not possess the ( unitary , orthogonal or symplectic ) invariance in hilbert space which is so essential for the successful analytical treatment of rmt .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a novel approach to the @xmath2body embedded gaussian ensembles .",
    "although physical interest focusses on the case @xmath14 , the generic features are better understood by addressing the case of arbitrary @xmath2 with @xmath15 . as always in rmt , we consider the limit of infinite matrix dimension , realized by letting @xmath16",
    "one essential tool in our analysis is provided by the orthogonal or unitary invariance of egoe(@xmath2 ) or egue(@xmath2 ) with respect to the single  particle states from which hilbert space is constructed .",
    "we show that this invariance takes over the role of the ( orthogonal or unitary ) invariance of standard rmt .",
    "we first focus attention on the second moment @xmath17 of the random @xmath2body interaction in the hilbert space of many  body states .",
    "we introduce a novel eigenvector expansion for @xmath17 .",
    "this allows us to derive statements about the shape of the average spectrum as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "further information on the spectral behavior of egoe(@xmath2 ) and egue(@xmath2 ) is obtained with the help of the supersymmetry method  @xcite which applies thanks to the eigenvector expansion of @xmath17 . we derive and solve the saddle ",
    "point equations for egoe(@xmath2 ) and egue(@xmath2 ) .",
    "we show that the mean level density and the spectral fluctuations coincide with those of canonical rmt .",
    "most importantly , we calculate the first non  vanishing term in the loop expansion and thereby estimate the range of validity of the saddle  point approximation . this range is given by @xmath5 .",
    "this result is consistent with an estimate obtained by calculating the second and fourth moments of the interaction . in order to gain access to the regime @xmath18",
    ", we generalize the `` binary correlation '' method of mon and french  @xcite to the calculation of level correlation functions .",
    "the method applies in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "we show that in this limit , the spectral fluctuations are poissonian .",
    "this is consistent with explicit results for @xmath7 . to reach a physical understanding of our results",
    ", we construct limiting ensembles of random matrices which are either fully integrable or fully chaotic .",
    "we show that egoe(@xmath2 ) and egue(@xmath2 ) lie between these two extremes . in this way",
    ", we show that  contrary to common belief  for @xmath19 and @xmath16 , egoe(@xmath2 ) and egue(@xmath2 ) do not follow wigner  dyson statistics , and we give a simple argument why this is so .",
    "we comment on the apparent agreement between canonical rmt and data from numerical simulation and from atomic and nuclear physics and argue that this agreement is caused by a finite  size effect which disappears in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the embedded ensembles and the limiting ensembles are defined in section  [ def ] .",
    "the second moment @xmath17 is introduced , and an important identity derived , in section  [ bas ] .",
    "the eigenvector expansion derived in section  [ eig ] is a central analytical result and enables us to calculate the low moments of the interaction ( section  [ low ] ) and to apply the supersymmetry method ( section  [ sup ] ) .",

    "a preliminary account of some of the results has appeared in refs .",

    "we note that for @xmath42 , we have done no more than rewrite the canonical ensembles goe and gue in what may appear a complicated way . naturally , interest focusses on the case @xmath43 .",
    "however , it is always useful to check that for @xmath44 our results coincide with canonical random  matrix theory .",

    "a graphical representation of the ensemble is obtained by assigning to each hilbert space vector @xmath46 a vertex @xmath47 , and to each non  diagonal matrix element @xmath48 which is not identically equal to zero , a link connecting the vertices @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements @xmath50 are represented by loops attached to the vertices @xmath51 .",

    "we get @xmath64 .",
    "we observe that the graph is very densely connected : for @xmath65 , @xmath61 is much smaller than @xmath9 .",

    "the number @xmath67 of independent random variables is different for the unitary and the orthogonal ensemble and essentially given by the square of the number of independent choices of the indices @xmath68 subject to the constraint @xmath69 .",

    "this shows that for @xmath74 there are strong correlations between matrix elements on different links .",

    "the interaction has the form @xmath88 which obviously commutes with all permutations of the labels @xmath22 and @xmath89 of the single  particle states .",
    "hence , the eigenvectors of the interaction are simultaneously eigenvectors of irreducible representations of the symmetric group : the system is integrable , and the spectral fluctuations are not wigner  dyson .",
    "the gaussian distribution of the factor @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.8 ] ) does not affect this statement as it only smears the entire spectrum of a given representation of the ensemble over an interval of width unity .",
    "we have not succeeded in diagonalizing the interaction matrix analytically for @xmath90 .",

    "for instance , a stochastic coupling of only two fixed matrices will , in general , not lead to random  matrix results .    in the light of these remarks",
    ", it seems appropriate to use the term localization for the results on eigenfunctions derived for @xmath7 .",

    "this insufficient mixing is due to the restriction of the interaction to nearest  neighbor couplings .",
    "if each lattice site were coupled to all other sites , localization would not occur . in the present context",
    ", it is not the limited number of links which causes localization but the further constraint on stochasticity caused by correlations between the matrix elements on these links .",

    "the case of nuclei with excitation energies near neutron threshold is probably the one with the largest number of interacting configurations : the number of valence nucleons is around six or eight , and the total number of configurations is around @xmath468 , implying values of @xmath12 in the tens or twenties .",

    "it is easy to see that the corresponding numbers in the second trace are @xmath584 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "this implies that in the first trace , only those states @xmath46 contribute for which in the first @xmath585 single  particle states , @xmath122 states are occupied .",
    "the remaining @xmath586 particles must be distributed over the remaining @xmath587 single  particle states .",
    "this yields a total of @xmath588 hilbert  space states which contribute to the first trace .",
    "the corresponding counting for the second trace yields @xmath589 .",
    "altogether , we find that the contribution of this particular permutation to the quantity @xmath566 is given by @xmath590 using stirling s formula , we find that for @xmath16 , this expression behaves as @xmath591 , independent of the value of @xmath122 .",
    "this then shows that all permutations yield the same behavior .",
    "their number is independent of @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "( actually , the single  particle operators appear in different sequences , giving perhaps rise to cancellations . this possibility is not considered here ) .",
    "we conclude that all connected terms in the two  point function vanish at least as fast as @xmath592 , so that for @xmath255 , the two  point function is given by the product of the averaged one  point functions and the two  point correlation function @xmath560 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7.7 ] ) vanishes .",
    "the same line of reasoning can be applied to the @xmath416point functions with @xmath593 .",
    "we find that every totally connected piece in the @xmath416point function containing @xmath55 cross  contracted pairs of @xmath31 s tends to zero as @xmath591 for @xmath16 .",
    "this shows that all higher @xmath416point functions are asymptotically likewise given by the product of @xmath416 average green functions .",
    "thus , all correlation functions vanish asymptotically , and the spectral fluctuations for egoe(@xmath2 ) become poissonian in the limit @xmath6",
