    "these include topological crystalline insulators with surface states protected by crystal lattice symmetry  @xcite , weyl semimetals with chiral fermions  @xcite , and topological magnetic insulators with quantized anomalous hall ( qah ) effects  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , strongly interacting systems could provide a new avenue to explore more exotic phases such as topological mott insulators and fractional chern insulators  @xcite .",
    "while the number of topological phases proposed in theory is still growing , experimental confirmations are limited to the systems of groups iv - vi elements .",
    "why have such topological phases not been detected in other abundant materials such as oxides ?",
    "in particular , transition metal oxides exhibit various collective phenomena stemming from strong electronic correlations , and this has led to tremendous interest and effort in growing oxide films to discover new functionalities .",
    "however , this effort has so far been focus mainly on 3d- and 4d - orbital systems with weak or moderate soc , and little attention has been paid to 5d - orbital systems with strong soc until recently .    among 5d - orbital systems ,",
    "ir oxides named iridates have provided an excellent playground to study the combined effects of soc and electron correlations .",
    "depending on the underlying lattice structure , iridates have offered a rich phase diagram  @xcite . despite different phases ,",

    "this b - glide symmetry generates a 2d topological insulator , and furthermore in the presence of a magnetic ordering and/or in - plane magnetic field , the system becomes a topological magnetic insulator .",

    "the relatively strong soc of ir atoms splits t@xmath28 states into @xmath6 and @xmath29 , and ir@xmath30 ionic configuration leading to the valence of @xmath31 makes these iridates to be a half - filled @xmath6 band . even though the tetragonal distortion of iro@xmath23 octahedra may affect the validity of the @xmath6 description in reality ,",
    "the tetragonal crystal field splitting is small compare to the soc of iridium  @xcite .",

    "@xmath194 in order to detect the anomalous hall conductivity @xmath193 , photon illumination with circularly polarized light can be used which has been reported in the monolayer mos@xmath3 transistors  @xcite .",
    "since these two valleys are related by the inversion symmetry , it requires to break the inversion symmetry to measure the valley - hall conductance in eq .",
    "[ eq : b11a ] .",
    "the mirror and mirror valley chern numbers @xmath195 can be understood through the behavior of edge modes localized at @xmath190 for instance .",
    "when the system is in mirror valley hall phase , there are four edge modes at @xmath190 or @xmath196 as shown in fig .",

    "the other two are flowing along the opposite direction named as @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath201 means the edge state carries @xmath174 quantum number which is the eigenvalue of @xmath172 and the valley degree of freedom @xmath182 .",
    "thus @xmath177 is finite .",
    "when the gap is reversed at @xmath72 , the propagating direction of the edge modes @xmath202 will reverse and result in a non - vanishing @xmath179 .",

    ", a finite bilayer hopping integral is crucial to achieve the qah phase when tr symmetry is broken , because the z - axis ferromagnetic exchange field @xmath203 ( or sublattice antiferromagnetic ordering @xmath204 ) has to overcome @xmath129 to reverse the sign of berry curvature around @xmath72 or @xmath73 in order to enter the qah insulator phase ( see the appendix for the proof ) . using the current tight binding parameters",
    ", the strength of @xmath185 needs to be about a few tesla as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : pd ] . since the critical strength of @xmath185 is tuned by the strength of @xmath129 , it is desirable to make the bilayer hopping @xmath129 smaller , which can be controlled by the spacing between the layers as shown in of fig .",
    "[ fig : abab ] .",
    "a recent experiment has reported successful growth of ir oxide superlattice [ ( sriro@xmath4)@xmath205 , srtio@xmath4 ] with controllable number of layers @xmath206 , which tailors a spin - orbit magnetic insulator for @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "@xcite due to the smaller lattice constant in tio@xmath3 compared with iro@xmath3 , it was expected that there are alternating rotations of ir octahedra , but lacking the tilting ( @xmath17 ) of octahedra to keep the tetragonal crystal structure of srtio@xmath4 .",
    "this was confirmed by the magnetic ordering patterns in @xmath207 and 2 superlattices , consistent with the first principle calculations .",
    "@xcite however , topological phases have not been observed in these superlattices , even though bulk sriro@xmath4 orthorhombic perovskites possess a crystal - symmetry - protected nodal line .",
    "@xcite    one essential ingredient to realize any topological insulator is a rashba - like soc . in the j@xmath209=1/2 wavefunction formed by a strong atomic soc ,",
    "this rashba - like soc is generated by finite hopping integrals between different @xmath210 states .",
    "for example , finite hopping paths between @xmath62 and @xmath211 generate rashba - like soc terms in @xmath47 basis since @xmath62 up - spin and one - dimensional orbitals of @xmath211 up - spin belong to different @xmath212 states . in layered perovskite systems , this is possible when the hopping path does not respect the mirror symmetry under @xmath213 , as @xmath62 is even while @xmath211 is odd under this operation .",
    "thus the alternating octahedra rotations and tiltings are necessary for topological phases in layered perovskites .",
    "we propose topological phases in ir oxide superlattices or films .",
    "different topological phases were found depending on how the tr and crystal symmetries are broken .",
    "we consider three types of superlattice : single layer , bilayer with abab stacking and bilayer with abcd stacking .",
    "a brief summary of our results is listed below .",
    "for the single - layer ir oxide , the dirac dispersion at x and y trim points is protected by the b - glide symmetry .",
    "when this b - glide symmetry is broken for instance by an uniaxial pressure , it reveals a 2d topological insulator by gapping the dirac nodes . in the presence of a magnetic ordering or external magnetic field , the system becomes a topological magnetic insulator with qah effects .    in the bilayer ir oxides ,",
    "we consider two different types of stacking .",
    "( 1 ) for abab stacking , the system is a semimetal with two nodal points at @xmath69 .",
    "any finite magnetic field for any direction expect @xmath214 $ ] axis or magnetic ordering turns the system into a topological magnetic insulator with qah effects .",
    "thus , the topological magnetic insulator in abab stacking is more realizable in current experiment setting than the single layer case .",
    "( 2 ) in the abcd stacking case , due to an additional mirror symmetry @xmath215 , it provides a richer phase diagram . besides the qah phase , there are two additional phases : tci with non - trivial mirror chern number and mvh insulators with quantized mirror - valley chern number .    experimentally , these superlattices or films are grown along the [ 001 ] axis , which can be achieved by a most standard pld growing technique . to test the proposal , arpes",
    "measurement can be employed to investigate the dirac points in these superlattices when tr symmetry is preserved , and hall conductivity measurement should exhibit the qah effect when a magnetic ordering occurs or an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "this work was supported by the nserc of canada and the center for quantum materials at the university of toronto .",
    "applying the following canonical transformation in @xmath97 and @xmath216 space , @xmath217 the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b1 ] ) can be brought it into a block diagonalized form . @xmath218 with @xmath219 where @xmath174 subscripts are assigned to reflect the eigenvalues of @xmath172 and the basis we choose for @xmath220 is a set of the eigenvectors of @xmath172 .",

    ", only one point @xmath225 will be taken into account .",
    "effective two band hamiltonian can be obtained by projecting the @xmath221 to the relevant two bands @xmath226 and @xmath227 at @xmath228 .",
    "@xmath229 where 1(2 ) refers to top ( bottom ) layer and @xmath230(@xmath231 ) for @xmath232 .",
