    "dwarf galaxies are believed to represent the dominant population , by number , of the present day universe , and a major constituent of groups ( ct et al .",
    "1997 ) and clusters ( e.g. ferguson & sandage 1991 ) .",
    "studying their star formation and chemical enrichment histories is key to understanding the evolution of galaxies on cosmological timescales ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "local group galaxies are ideal laboratories for detailed studies of dwarf galaxy properties : we can resolve their individual stars and thus learn about their star formation histories ( sfhs ) by exploring ages , metallicities , and the spatial distribution of the stellar populations they contain .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is the best tool to retrieve the sfh of a stellar system .",
    "the ideal situation is when it reaches the oldest main - sequence ( ms ) turnoffs with good photometric accuracy . in this case , the information on the sfh can be obtained directly and with little ambiguity from the distribution of stars on the ms , and its comparison with that predicted by stellar evolution models in this relatively well known phase of stellar evolution . in particular , the range of ages and metallicities present can be determined through comparison with theoretical isochrones . to quantitatively determine the sfh , it is necessary to compare the observed density distribution of stars with that predicted by stellar evolution models ( see gallart , zoccali & aparicio 2005 ) . shallower cmds ( e.g. those reaching just below the horizontal - branch ( hb ) or a couple of magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) ) still contain stars born through the whole galaxy s lifetime , but the interpretation of the distribution of stars in terms of the sfh is progressively less detailed and uncertain as the cmd is shallower .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : on one hand , the stellar evolution models are less accurate for more advanced stellar evolution phases such as the rgb or the hb , because the corresponding physics is more complicated or uncertain . on the other hand , in these stellar evolution phases ,",
    "stars of very different ages are packed together in the cmd in a small interval of color and/or magnitude , and suffer from important age - metallicity degeneracies ( see gallart 2000 and gallart et al .",
    "2005 for detailed discussions of all these issues ) .",
    "for all the milky way satellites , it is possible to obtain cmds reaching the oldest ms turnoffs using ground based telescopes , while for the rest of the local group , this is possible using the acs on board the hst .",
    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are particularly interesting among the milky way satellites since they are actively star forming galaxies which sfh can shed light on the role played by interactions in galaxy evolution .",
    "but in spite of their proximity and intrinsic interest , it is remarkable that there are still important gaps in the knowledge of the sfh of the mcs .",
    "this may be explained by their huge projected size and the big number of stars to analyze .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the smc is a dwarf irregular satellite of our galaxy , with low mean metallicity and a high mass fraction remaining in gaseous form ( van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the smc is in a more primitive evolutionary stage than its larger neighbor , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "historically , the study of this galaxy has been in general neglected in favor of the lmc .",
    "the uncertainty about its line of sight depth , its more complicated shape ( elongated towards the northeast ) , and its larger distance from us are factors at play .    to our knowledge ,",
    "only two papers have presented cmds reaching the oldest ms turnoffs for a small field of view each : dolphin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and mccumber et al .",
    "dolphin et al .",
    "presented a combination of hst and ground - based _",
    "v _ and _ i _ images of a smc field situated 2@xmath1 northeast of ngc 121 ( avoiding the contamination from 47 tucanae ) in order to derive the sfh of this smc field . from their ground - based images , they inferred a peak of star formation between 5 and 8 gyr ago with a medium age of 7.5 gyr at the 1 @xmath3 level , and that 14@xmath45% of the stars were formed more than 11 gyr ago .",
    "the sfh they derived is also consistent at the 2 @xmath3 level with a continuous star formation from ancient times until @xmath02 gyr ago , when the star formation rate dropped to finally stop entirely in the past 0.5 gyr .",
    "more recently , mccumber et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analyzed the stellar populations of a smc field located in the `` wing '' area with observations from the hst wfpc2 .",
    "they compared the luminosity function from their observed cmd with those obtained from two different model cmds , one with constant sfr(t ) and another with bursts of star formation at @xmath02 and at @xmath08 gyr .",
    "they found that the population appears to have formed largely in a quasi - continuous mode , with a main period of star formation between 4 - 12 gyr ago and very recent star formation with bright stars as young as 100@xmath410 myr .",
    "two main wide field studies of the smc exist : the pioneer work by gardiner & hatzidimitriou ( 1992 ) and a recent study from harris & zaritsky ( 2004 ; hereafter hz04 ) .",
    "gardiner & hatzidimitriou ( 1992 ) presented the first large area study of the smc , and mainly concentrated their analysis in the outer regions , beyond 2@xmath1 from the smc center .",
    "they took six photographic plates with the uk schmidt telescope covering a total area of 130@xmath1@xmath5130@xmath1 .",
    "since their photometry is rather shallow ( reaching the hb level at r@xmath020 mag ) , they mainly gave information about the young populations ( age @xmath62 gyr ) .",
    "from their cmds and contour plots of the surface distribution of ms stars with _ b - r_@xmath70.1 and _ r_@xmath720 , they noticed the almost complete absence of bright ms stars in the northwestern part , while a considerable bright ms population was present in the eastern and southern area . with the aid of luminosity functions they found that young populations ( @xmath70.6 gyr in age ) are concentrated towards the center of the smc and in the `` wing '' region . using an index defined as the difference between the median color ( in _ ( b - r ) _ ) of the rc and the color of the rgb at the level of the hb",
    ", the authors inferred that the bulk of the field population has a median age around 10 - 12 gyr .",
    "they were the first to notice the different distribution of young and old populations in the smc .",
    "zaritsky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and cioni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) confirmed that the asymmetric appearance of the smc , similar to that of the hi ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "1999 ) , is primarily caused by the distribution of young stars ( upper ms stars , younger than @xmath00.2 gyr ) , and that the older stars have a spheroidal distribution .",
    "hz04 presented a study of the smc based on the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ) _ ubvi _ catalog ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 ) , which covers a 4@xmath1@xmath54.5@xmath1 area of the smc to a depth of _ v_@xmath621 .",
    "this work represents the most complete analysis of the spatially resolved sfh of the central part of the smc .",
    "they divided the smc survey in a grid of 351 cells and obtained the sfh , through a @xmath8@xmath9 minimization between the star counts in the observed cmd and those in the model cmds based on isochrones by girardi et al .",
    "they inferred that a significant fraction ( @xmath050% ) of all stars in the smc were formed more than 8.4 gyr ago . between 3 and 8.4 gyr",
    "ago they found a quiescent period during which the smc formed few stars .",
    "they also found a recent active time from 3 gyr ago until now , with bursts at 2.5 gyr , 400 myr , and 60 myr .",
    "although deeper than the one from gardiner & hatzidimitriou ( 1992 ) , this study is still limited by its shallowness .",
    "in fact , the oldest stars that they can observe on the ms are @xmath02 gyr old , and this implies a necessarily poor temporal resolution and larger uncertainties in their sfh at ages older than that .    in spite of the increasing interest in studying the smc , reflected by the recent works mentioned before",
    ", there are still many questions unanswered which require the information provided by cmds reaching the oldest ms turnoffs .",
    "what is the age distribution of the old and intermediate - age population ?",
    ", are there gradients in the composition of this underlying population ? .",
    "shallower studies inform about the existence of a large amount of young population in certain areas , but does this young population reflect an exceptional increase of the star formation at the present time with respect to the average sfr ? . to shed light on these aspects , in this article we present twelve unprecedented deep _ br_-based smc cmds with positions ranging from @xmath01 to @xmath04 from the smc center .",
    "our fields are distributed in different parts of the smc , avoiding the central area , where crowding may not allow us to reach the oldest ms turnoffs from the ground .",
    "three of our fields are located in the `` wing '' area , near the field studied by mccumber et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; two fields are in the western part and one in the northwestern area , near the field from dolphin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) located 2 northeast of ngc121 ; finally , six fields are placed towards the south at different galactocentric distances .",
    "this strategic selection of fields , in spite of their small size , permit us to sample several regions of the smc with high temporal resolution in order to address the above issues .",
    "the depth of our fields , reaching the oldest ms turnoffs with very good photometric accuracy , will allow us to obtain detailed sfhs from all of them , and to investigate , therefore , the variation of the sfh across the smc field .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper . here",
    "we will focus the analysis in the inspection of the cmds with the aid of theoretical isochrones and color functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ obs ] we present the observations and data reduction . in   [ photometry ]",
    "we discuss the photometry of the smc fields , obtained using daophot ii / allstar and allframe programs . in   [ stellar ]",
    "the cmds are discussed with the help of isochrones and color functions . in   [ summary ] and   [ conclu ]",
    "our results are summarized and discussed . in a future paper ( nol et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will derive the sfh of the smc through comparison of the observed cmds with synthetic cmds .",
    "the present paper is a result of a more comprehensive program to study the smc , which also includes the determination of its absolute proper motion by observing smc fields in which background quasars have been identified .",
    "these quasars provide a quasi - inertial reference frame with respect to which ( in conjunction with existing radial velocity measurements ) the absolute total space velocity vector of the smc can be precisely determined ( see e.g. pedreros , costa & mndez 2006 ) .",
    "the imaging strategy was therefore designed in a way that would satisfy the needs of the stellar populations program as well as the astrometry program .",
    "given that for the latter it was mandatory to obtain _",
    "r_-band images , this bandpass together with _",
    "b _ imaging was chosen to construct the cmds .",
    "the observations were made with a 24 @xmath10m / pixel tektronic 2048x2048 ccd detector attached to the cassegrain focus of the 100-inch irne du pont telescope ( c100 ) at las campanas observatory , in chile .",

    "the reason is that , in cmds like [ _ ( b - r ) , r _ ] or [ _ ( v - i ) , i _ ] , the ms of isochrones of different age follow roughly vertical paths up to the ms turnoff where they turn to the red , almost perpendicularly to the ms , to form the subgiant branch or , in the case of more massive stars , the blue loops .",
    "this effect is clear from the cmd in panel ( a ) of figure  [ docfsynt ] ( we will return to this figure later ) .",

    "most of the information belongs in any case to the ms and subgiant branch .",
    "the fraction of cf that belongs to the rgb and rc serves as a check of the metallicity assumed for the synthetic cmd , and contributes to the overall normalization of the cf .",
    "comparison of the stellar content of a galaxy with isochrones and cfs is complementary in terms of the information on the stellar population they provide .",
    "the isochrones give us the range of ages present in a given cmd ; the comparison between theoretical and observed cfs is a good tool to assess the relative amounts of stars of different ages present in a stellar population .",
    "this is a particular case of a comparison of the number of stars in a set of boxes in the observed and synthetic cmds respectively ( e.g. gallart et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , the cf is particularly useful for a first qualitative assessment of the sfh because it is a one - dimensional representation of the content of the cmd in which there is a relatively direct correlation between range of ages and color .",
    "all the models used here have been computed using the synthetic cmd algorithm iac - star ( aparicio & gallart 2004 ) .",

    "panel ( c ) of figure  [ docfsynt ] shows which populations contribute to each feature in the cf for the synthetic cmd in panel ( a ) . by comparing these , we find the following : the elevation in -0.3@xmath44(b - r)@xmath440.2 in the composite cf mostly corresponds to stars in the age range 0@xmath19t@xmath441.1 gyr ; in the central peak ( 0.3@xmath44(b - r)@xmath440.9 ) there are populations of all ages , predominating the intermediate - age and old stars ( @xmath02 - 13 gyr ) .",
    "the second local maximum corresponds to the rc and the red part of the subgiant branch and is composed by stars with age @xmath451 gyr as seen in panel ( c ) in figure  [ docfsynt ] .",
    "going back to panel ( b ) , the cf in black corresponds to a galaxy with a constant sfr(t ) ( i.e. , the cf of the cmd in the panel ( a ) ) .",
    "the blue cf is from a synthetic cmd computed assuming a sfr(t ) that increased from 3 gyr ago to the present .",
    "this cf presents a higher blue elevation due to the bigger number of young blue stars ; also the central peak is somewhat blueshifted .",
    "the green cf represents a stellar population in which the sfr(t ) dropped by 50% between 3 and 8 gyr ago .",
    "this is reflected in the shape of the absolute maximum , where a depression appears as a result of the assumed sfh .",
    "this kind of feature would be difficult to detect in a real population .",
    "finally , the red cf corresponds to a sfr(t ) with a totally quiescent period between 3 and 8 gyr ago .",
    "the deep hollow shown in the absolute maximum of this cf is due to the gap at intermediate ages in the sfh .",
    "the last two cfs show a higher blue elevation as compared to a cf of a cmd with constant sfr(t ) due to the higher fraction of young stars over the whole population .    prior to present a discussion based on cfs , we will briefly talk about the crowding effects and , in general , the observational errors that are present in our photometry .",
    "a careful study of the extent and nature of these crowding effects is key to study the stellar populations present in the smc",

    "we will discuss here how the observational errors affect the cf of a few representative fields .",
    "those located closer to the smc center ( e.g. smc0057 and qj0111 ) are more affected by crowding than the rest of the fields . to quantify these observational errors",
    "we have simulated them for different smc fields in the synthetic cmd of figure  [ docfsynt ] .",
    "following gallart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we will call the latter `` model cmds '' .",
    "the model cfs ( corresponding to the model cmds ) corresponding to fields smc0057 , qj0111 , and smc0049 are shown in figure  [ dispersadas ] , together with the original cf ( the cf obtained from the synthetic cmd ) .",
    "the observational errors may produce significant variations in the appearance of the cf of our more central , crowded field smc0057 . simulating the observational errors of this field in the synthetic cmd",
    ", we obtain a model cf ( dotted line ) which differs substantially from the cf of the original synthetic cmd : the absolute maximum in its cf is smaller than in the cf of the synthetic cmd , and the blue elevation is bigger because faint stars on the low ms are lost much more frequently than the brighter blue stars that constitute the young ms .",
    "the dispersion introduced in the cmd when the observational errors are simulated produces an absolute maximum that is slightly wider as shown in the dotted line in figure  [ dispersadas ] .",
    "this shows how crowding could simulate a non - constant sfh , mimicking a recent enhancement of the star formation , similar to the one shown in blue in panel ( b ) of figure  [ docfsynt ] .",
    "although still present , the effects of crowding are less severe in the case of field qj0111 since the cf of the corresponding model cmd ( dashed line ) resembles quite closely the cf for the synthetic cmd . in this field",
    ", confusion is mainly affecting the _ yellow _ stars so the main maximum is shorter than in the synthetic cf . in the case of smc0049",
    ", it can be seen that the cf of the model cmd ( dot - long dashed line ) is similar to the one of the synthetic cmd ( solid line ) , indicating that crowding is affecting very little the cmds of this part of the galaxy ( at @xmath02.9@xmath36 ) . in conclusion , only the cf of field smc0057",
    "is substantially affected by observational errors .",
    "the effects of crowding on field qj0111 can be considered as an upper limit for fields qj0112 and qj0116 . for fields",

    "let s concentrate now on the observed cfs of each of our fields . in figures  [ three_east_synt ] to  [ six_south_synt ]",
    "the cf corresponding to the synthetic cmd ( dashed lines ) from panel ( a ) in figure  [ docfsynt ] and the cfs ( solid lines ) from the observed cmds were overlapped . note that the shape of the synthetic cf depends on the selection of metallicities and stellar evolution libraries .",
    "however , small changes in the metallicity law , which result in synthetic cmds with a color distribution compatible with the data have also very similar cfs . comparison between the observed and synthetic cfs computed assuming constant sfr(t ) lets us to qualitatively analyze the sfh of each field .",
    "figure  [ three_east_synt ] shows the cfs of the eastern smc fields . in the first panel , corresponding to field qj0111 , synthetic cfs of synthetic populations with bursts of 50% 1 gyr ago ( long dashed line ) , of 30% 1 gyr ago ( dotted line ) , and of 50% 2 gyr ago ( dot - long dashed line ) were also overplotted .",
    "the cf of field qj0111 shows some differences with respect to the cf of a population with constant sfr(t ) . in particular , the observed cf has higher values than the synthetic one in the blue elevation ( -0.3@xmath44(b - r)@xmath440.2 ; age@xmath441.1 gyr ) which indicates a sfh with enhanced star formation at young ages .",
    "this fact is also shown by comparing with the cf of synthetic populations with bursts .",
    "in fact , the blue maximum and the main peak of the cf with a burst of 30% 1 gyr ago and the ones of the observed cf match very well , pointing out that there was an episode around 1 gyr ago of enhanced star formation in this field which may have continued to the present time . though a comprehensive analysis of the cmds will be presented in a forthcoming paper , this superposition allows us to say that the observed cf is compatible with a sfh with an increase in the star formation of @xmath030% in the last 1 gyr .",
    "also note that crowding effects are not very significative in this field , as seen from the artificial star tests .",
    "the cf of field qj0112 is a remarkable case where the cf corresponds almost exactly with that of a population with constant sfr(t ) ( at least in average ) .",
    "the cf of qj0116 presents a somewhat greater values of the cf in 0@xmath44(b - r)@xmath440.3 as compared with the cf of a cmd with constant sfr(t ) , which may correspond to stars formed between @xmath01 - 2 gyr ago , possibly indicating some enhancement in the sfr(t ) at those ages in comparison with more recent ages . note that these three fields have a very similar cmd , and that simple comparison with isochrones gives the same information for all three : presence of stars of all ages .",
    "the differences in their cfs are a good illustration of the complementary information that the cf can provide .",
    "the presence in the observed cfs of all the features that characterize the synthetic cf is the counterpart , in this representation of the data , of the fact that the cmds are well populated over all age ranges . the additional information brought forward by the cfs is the relative weight of the different age ranges in the population .    in figure  [ three_west_synt ] , the cfs of the western smc fields are shown .",
    "the almost complete absence of the blue elevation in the color interval -0.3@xmath44(b - r)@xmath440.2 , reflects the fact that there are few stars younger than @xmath01 gyr .",
    "this is another example of the usefulness of the cfs : while in fields qj0036 and qj0037 there are stars until around the 0.1 gyr isochrone , the cfs indicate that the relative amount of stars between 0 gyr and 2 gyr is substantially less than in the case of a field with constant sfr(t ) .",
    "the central maximum is slightly shifted to the red , possibly indicating that the sfr(t ) started to decline around 3 gyr ago .",
    "note that this shift is unlikely due to an overall shift of the observed cmd with respect to the synthetic one , since the shift does not affect the red relative maximum of the cf .",
    "in fact , this maximum is slightly shifted to the blue and higher in the cf of the observed cmd as compared with that of the synthetic one .",
    "this is possibly due to field stars , which contribute more in relative numbers to the poorly populated cmds . actually , the observed red maximum is higher with respect to the theoretical one in the less populated qj0033 .",
    "the composition of the population in these three western cmds seems to be very similar , even in the outermost field , qj0033 .",
    "finally , figure  [ six_south_synt ] shows the cfs of the southern smc fields . in the case of field smc0057",
    ", the relative amount of young stars might be overestimated due to crowding effects if these were not taken into account .",
    "the overplot of the observed cf ( solid line ) with the synthetic ( dashed line ) and the model ( i.e. after taking into account crowding effects , dotted line ) ones shown in figure  [ six_south_synt ] indicate that part of the enhancement of the blue elevation in field smc0057 is produced by observational errors but that there is still a true recent enhancement ( 0@xmath19t@xmath193 gyr ) in the star formation .",
    "the cf of field smc0100 is still almost compatible with a constant sfr(t ) on average , with possibly a truncation of the sfr(t ) at recent ages , as also hinted by the comparison of its cmd with isochrones in figure  [ six_south_iso ] .",
    "moving further away from the smc center , the elevations corresponding to the first structure in the cfs are less conspicuous , indicating that young stars are less common and intermediate - age stars dominate the fields .",
    "the fact that the main peak is redder from field qj0047 on ( except , maybe , in the case of field qj0102 which is situated more towards the east than the other southern fields ) , points out that there is a larger amount of old stars and , like in the western fields , that possibly the sfr(t ) started to decline around 3 gyr ago . as in the case of the western field qj0033 , the second , red relative maximum in the cfs gets bigger with increasing galactocentric distance .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold .",
    "first , the amount of stars in the rc and in the rgb , relative to the total stellar content is larger at larger distances from the center ( even though not large differences among fields seem to be present beyong r@xmath212.7@xmath36 ) , where the age of the stellar population is older on average .",
    "second , the contamination by foreground stars is larger relative to the total number of stars from the galaxy .",
    "this last factor , may be the main player in the case of field smc0053 .",
    "we obtained _ b _ and _ r_-band photometry of stars from 12 smc fields observed during 4 different campaigns with the c100 telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the spatial distribution of the fields samples different parts of the galaxy , both in areas with large amounts of recent star formation such as the `` wing '' area and `` undisturbed '' regions at the west and towards the south part of the galaxy , in which the stellar populations may be representative of the underlying population of the smc formed prior to the events of star formation that shaped its current irregular morphology .",
    "the stellar content present in these smc fields has been analyzed by means of a set of [ _ b - r , r _ ] cmds that reach the oldest ms turnoffs ( m@xmath18@xmath03.5 ) with an excellent photometric accuracy .    in this first aproach to study the sfh of our smc fields , we found the following .",
    "the fields in the `` wing '' area contain very young blue stars and show a broad ms turnoff / subgiant region and a wide range in luminosity of the rc , pointing out that star formation in these parts has extended from at least @xmath013 gyr ago to the present with no substantial gaps , as the areas around all the overlapped isochrones are well populated .",
    "( the closest to the center of the smc in this `` wing '' area ) seems to have experienced an enhancement in its recent star formation , compatible with an enhancement of 30% in the sfr(t ) over the last 1 gyr .",
    "this is indicated by the height of the blue elevation its cf ( color interval in the range -0.3@xmath44(b - r)@xmath440.2 ) as compared with that of cfs corresponding to synthetic populations with different sfr(t ) .",
    "the other two fields analyzed in this direction seem to have had a sfr(t ) close to constant on average .",
    "very little star formation has been going on from @xmath01 gyr ago until now in the western fields , as indicated by the much lower amount of young blue stars and the lack of the blue elevation in the cfs .",
    "considering the rc ( formed by stars older than @xmath01 gyr ) of fields qj0036 and qj0111 , both located at the same galactocentric distance , we found that the number of stars is comparable , indicating that the integrated sfr(t ) from old ages and until @xmath01 gyr ago in both fields is similar , and that there was a mechanism in the `` wing '' area that triggered the star formation around 1 gyr ago , in particular , in the location of field qj0111 . field qj0033",
    ", though located further away from the center in the northwest , presents a distribution of stellar ages similar to that of the two other western fields , as seen from the resemblance of the three cfs and from its cmd , in which the area below the turnoff of the 4 gyr isochrone is still quite populated .",
    "in fact , the apparent differences between the cmd of field qj0033 and the other two are due to the much larger number of stars populating those .",
    "if only a subset of stars of those cmds are represented , to equal number of stars in the cmd of qj0033 , the distribution of stars around the different isochrones is very similar . in these three fields",
    ", the bulk of stars seems to be older than 3 - 4 gyr .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by dolphin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a field located in the northwestern part and relatively close to field qj0033 ( see figure  [ smchi ] ) , where they found a greatly decreased star formation in the past 2 gyr .    regarding the fields observed toward the south , the young population is less important from r=2.7@xmath36 on .",
    "the blue elevation in the cfs of the southern fields is only found in the two fields closer to the center . in the case of smc0057 , its shape is consistent with some enhancement of the recent sfh as compared to a constant sfr(t ) . from the cfs",
    "it is evident that field smc0100 has many more stars younger than 2 gyr ( relative to the total population of the field ) than the western fields qj0036 and qj0037 , even when it is almost 1@xmath36 further from the smc center than the latters . note that this field is located at the border of a more densely populated isopleth than qj0036 and qj0037 and in the part in which the trumpet - like distribution of the young population _",
    "fans out_. beyond @xmath02.7@xmath36 , there are only few stars younger than 3 gyr old and the differences between the fields are small ( except for the fact that the density of stars in field smc0049 is larger than in the other two ) . finally , except for eastermost field qj0102 , the further south from the smc center we go , the more is the main peak of the cf shifted to the red .",
    "this , together with the above facts , may indicate that the _ main _ epoch of star formation beyond @xmath02.2@xmath36 in this direction ended around 3 - 4 gyr ago .",
    "the smc shows a clear morphologic dichotomy between its young and old population .",
    "the youngest component has an asymmetric distribution which _ fans out _ towards the `` wing '' area in the northeast , similarly to the hi distribution ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "1999 ) , while the rgb and agb stars have a more symmetric , spheroidal distribution . using deep ( down to @xmath46 ) cmds in 12 small fields that strategically sample different smc regions",
    ", we are trying to shed some new light into our knowledge of the smc evolution , and answer some of the questions posed in the introduction .",
    "we found that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is mainly composed by intermediate - age and old stars , and its distribution does not show strong galactocentric gradients .",
    "our fields situated toward the northwest of the bar , at galactocentric distances from 1.3@xmath36 to 2.9@xmath36 contain very few stars younger than @xmath47 3 gyr .",
    "the comparison of their cfs with that of a synthetic population with constant sfr(t ) indicates there has been an actual drop of the sfr(t ) at around this age until the present . even though , some residual star formation seems to have continued up to now .",
    "no strong differences can be noticed between the cmds and cfs of the fields at 1.3@xmath36 and 1.4@xmath36 and the one at 2.9@xmath36 .",
    "the apparent differences between these cmds are mainly due to the different number of stars in them , rather to a fundamentally different composition of the stellar populations .",
    "something similar occurs in the case of the southern fields beyond @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , we estimated that the sfr(t ) at intermediate to old ages in fields located at the same distance from the smc center and at either side ( e.g. qj0111 and qj0036 ) is similar .",
    "with the current analysis of the data we can not provide a detailed sfh for these fields , and therefore we can not confirm nor rule out periods of quiescence as found in other studies that used shallower data .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the three fields situated towards the east , in the `` wing '' region , show very active current star formation . in the case of the field closer to the center ,",
    "qj0111 , we estimated that the current star formation rate ( from around 1 gyr ago to the present ) in this field is @xmath030% larger than the sfr(t ) averaged over the galaxy s life .",
    "however , the other two northeastern fields , situated just slightly further away from the center , have a cf which is compatible with that of a constant sfr(t ) over the whole galaxy s history .",
    "therefore , only the parts of the wing closer to the center , seem to be undergoing an exceptionally intense episode of star formation at the present time .    at the radius of the innermost field ( @xmath01 kpc )",
    ", we derived a crossing time of @xmath010@xmath49 yr , obtained adopting a measured velocity dispersion of 36 km / s ( carrera 2006 , using the stars below the rgb tip corresponding to our smc fields ) . in the case of our outermost field",
    "( @xmath04 kpc ) the crossing time is @xmath02@xmath510@xmath49 yr .",
    "large scale asymmetries should disappear within a few crossing times , and the population older than @xmath01 gyr is then expected to be well mixed at a radius of @xmath01 kpc , while the population older than @xmath02 gyr is well mixed at @xmath04 kpc . hence , although our fields only cover little isolated parts of the smc ( as compared with the huge area embraced by hz04 ) , they are representative of the smc populations older than @xmath02 gyr .    the larger amount of young stars present in the eastern fields may be related to a recent interaction between the smc , the lmc , and the milky way as is suggested by numerical models ( e.g. yoshizawa & noguchi 2003 ) . note that the presence of a considerable young population in the eastern fields and lack thereof in the western ones is in good correspondence with the existence or absence of large amounts of hi at the corresponding locations ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this trend is not maintained in the closest southern field , smc0057 , in which there is a considerable amount of young population but the amount of hi is small .",
    "the presence of a substantial amount of intermediate - age population in our outermost smc fields , could be a sign that a few gigayears ago hi gas extended as far as @xmath04@xmath36 and has since gradually receded to the more central regions .",
    "another possible explanation for this is that tidal interactions happened periodically , and then these stars dynamically mixed , resulting in old stars ( those from previous passages ) being symmetrically distributed and the younger ones only in the current tidal feature .",
    "none of the studied fields is dominated by an old stellar component , as one would expect for an old stellar halo similar to the one of the milky way .",
    "this may mean that a disk population is still dominating over a possible old halo , if it does exist in the smc .",
