    "[ sec1 ] in the past few years there has been a renewed interest in higher spin gravity in various dimensions following the work of vasiliev and collaborators ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the present paper",
    "we focus on higher spin theories in three spacetime dimensions .",
    "gaberdiel and gopakumar proposed a duality of the two dimensional @xmath1 minimal model cfts to three dimensional vasiliev theory @xcite .",
    "the original proposal has passed many checks and some refinements in recent years , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the three dimensional vasiliev theory @xcite is that while it is a complicated nonlinear theory coupling an infinite tower of higher spin fields to scalar matter , if the scalars are linearized , the theory can be reformulated in terms of a chern - simons theory with an infinite dimensional gauge algebra @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath3 is associated with the t hooft coupling of the dual cft @xcite .",
    "the chern - simons theory simplifies if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an integer and the theory reduces to chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath6 and is purely topological , corresponding to a theory of massless fields of spin @xmath7 .",
    "note that einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant is included by taking @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the simplest solutions of the chern - simons theory correspond to @xmath9 vacua .",
    "the asymptotic symmetry of the @xmath10 vacuum in @xmath11 higher spin gravity depends on the embedding of a @xmath12 sub - algebra in @xmath13 . for",
    "the principal embedding one obtains @xmath1 symmetry @xcite , whereas for non - principal embeddings other higher spin algebras such as @xmath14 can occur @xcite .",
    "the construction of black holes in @xmath10/cft is important since ( large ) black holes describe the dual cft in thermal equilibrium at finite temperature .",
    "the btz solution @xcite of three dimensional gravity has been a very important part of exploring the @xmath10/cft correspondence ( see @xcite for a review ) . in higher spin theories",
    "the definition of what constitutes a black hole is nontrivial since the metric field transforms under higher spin gauge transformations @xcite and hence the standard geometric characterization of a black hole , i.e. the existence of a horizon is not gauge invariant . in @xcite a new criterion was proposed which uses the holonomy of the chern - simons gauge field around the contractable euclidean time circle to characterize a regular black hole .",
    "the holonomy condition has been applied to various black holes in 3 dimensional higher spin theories @xcite and it has been checked by comparing bulk and cft calculations of thermal correlation functions @xcite , see @xcite for a review and a more extended list of references .",
    "note that there are some puzzles remaining , for example there are two different proposals for the entropy , namely the ",
    "holomorphic `` @xcite and the ",
    "canonical '' @xcite one .",
    "see @xcite for recent work on the two proposals and their possible relation .    in the chern - simons formulation of of higher spin gravity , the @xmath1 extension of the virasoro symmetry of the boundary theory is obtained via the drinfeld - sokolov reduction by specifying asymptotic boundary fall off conditions for the gauge fields and considering nontrivial gauge transformations which respect these boundary conditions .",
    "if the boundary conditions are consistent then the boundary charges are integrable , finite and conserved and generate the ( extended ) symmetry algebra .",
    "it is a very interesting question whether the higher spin gravity / cft duality in three dimensions can be generalized to non - ads backgrounds . in @xcite a general recipe and examples including lobachevsky ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "lifshitz , schrodinger and warped @xmath10 backgrounds were given .",
    "more recently the same philosophy was applied to flat space holography in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in a construction and detailed analysis of higher spin realizations of asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "such spacetimes provide candidates for a holographic description of field theories with lifshitz scaling invariance .",
    "these theories exhibit an anisotropic scaling symmetry with respect to space and time @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and are important in various condensed matter systems ( see @xcite for references ) . in @xcite",
    "a holographic lifshitz spacetime solution of a gravity theory coupled to anti - symmetric tensor fields in four dimension was given .",
    "subsequently lifshitz space times have been ground in many ( super)gravity theories , see e.g. @xcite . in holographic theories black hole or",
    "black brane solutions provide the dual description of field theories at finite temperature ( and chemical potential if the black holes are charged ) . for lifshitz spacetimes",
    "the construction of black holes was initiated in @xcite , but most solutions in the literature are only known numerically .    in the present paper",
    "we focus mainly on the simplest three dimensional higher spin theory which is based on @xmath0 chern - simons theory and corresponds to gravity coupled to a massless spin three field . for simplicity ,",
    "most explicit calculations are performed in this theory , but we shall also comment on generalizations to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we give a brief review of the chern - simons formulation of higher spin gravity . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we review some salient features of field theories which enjoy lifshitz scaling symmetry , and we discuss the holographic realization of such theories .",
    "we then review how the lifshitz spacetime can be obtained as a solution to @xmath0 chern - simons theory , and we demonstrate that the algebra generating lifshitz isometries can be realized in a higher spin context .    in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we construct black hole solutions with lifshitz scaling , focusing on the simplest case of non - rotating black holes .",
    "we discuss the gauge freedom and the holonomy conditions as well as the thermodynamics .",
    "when the holonomy conditions are solved to express the temperature and chemical potential in terms of the extensive parameters there are six different branches .",
    "only two of the six have positive temperature and entropy and are hence physically sensible .",
    "we consider two additional conditions on the branches , first the local thermodynamic stability and second the existence of a radial gauge where the metric exhibits a regular horizon and find that only one branch satisfies all of these conditions .    in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we discuss generalizations of our work including the possibility of constructing rotating black hole solutions as well as lifshitz black holes in @xmath20 higher spin theory .",

    "if one augments the symmetry of the theory to include space and time translations , then one obtains a theory that is said to possess lifshitz symemtry .",
    "lifshitz symmetry can therefore be encoded as a lie algebra generated by time translations @xmath42 , spatial translations @xmath43 and lifshitz scalings @xmath44 satisfying the following structure relations : @xmath45&=0 \\qquad    [ d , h]=z h \\qquad    [ d , p]= p .\\label{lifalg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in two dimensions , conformal symmetry ( with @xmath46 ) implies a conserved , traceless and symmetric stress tensor . for theories with lifshitz scaling the stress tensor does not have to be symmetric , since they do not possess boost invariance .",
    "the stress - energy complex for field theories in 1 + 1 dimensions with lifshitz scaling exponent @xmath47 contains the following objects : the energy density @xmath48 , the energy flux @xmath49 , the momentum density @xmath50 and the stress energy tensor @xmath51 .",
    "these quantities satisfy the following conservation equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath52 in addition , the lifshitz scaling with exponent @xmath47 implies a modified tracelessness condition @xmath53 the lifshitz symmetries of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional metric can be realized holographically with the following metric : @xmath54 where the lifshitz scaling transformation corresponds to a translation @xmath55 .",
    "this metric is not a solution of einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant ; one has to add matter or higher derivative terms to the action to obtain it as a solution .",
    "one can realize the @xmath56 lifshitz metric in the @xmath0 higher spin theory @xcite by choosing the radial gauge as in ( ) and by choosing the following connections @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 it follows from that this connection reproduces the lifshitz metric with scaling exponent @xmath56 .",

    ", we look for the most general , flat connections with the property that @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the lifshitz connections specified in .",
    "the most general connections that obey these asymptotics are obtained by adding terms to the lifshitz connections @xmath64 in proprotional to @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( and similarly for @xmath67 ) . in particular , we consider the following ansatz : @xmath68 before applying flatness conditions , we allow all coefficients @xmath69 to be arbitrary functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by suitable gauge transformations , we can set @xmath70 employing the same notation as used in the higher spin black holes , we denote @xmath71 and , after applying the flatness conditions , we obtain @xmath72 along with the following evolution equations for @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 if we follow the same procedure for the barred sector , imposing the condition , then we find the following asymptotically lifshitz connections : @xmath76 where again the flatness conditions produce evolution equations for the barred quantities @xmath77 which can be obtained , up to signs , from and by replacing @xmath78 and @xmath79 by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "@xmath100 form - invariance also gives evolution equations for @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath103 and it constrains the forms of the variations @xmath104 and @xmath105 @xmath106 now that we know the precise form of the most general gauge parameters leaving the connections form - invariant , we attempt to identify which of these parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 lead to charges that satisfy a lifshitz algebra .",
    "to find these parameters , we first notice that given the lifshitz metric , the lifshitz algebra is geometrically realized by the following killing vectors : @xmath109 explicitly , one easily verifies that @xmath110 = 0 , \\qquad [ \\xi_d,\\xi_h ] = 2\\xi_h , \\qquad [ \\xi_d , \\xi_p ] =    \\xi_p.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is precisely the lifshitz algebra with @xmath56 .",
    "these killing vectors generate spacetime diffeomorphisms , and there is a standard realization diffeomorphisms as gauge transformations in chern - simons theory via field - dependent gauge parameters @xcite @xmath111 for the asymptotically lifshitz connections of section [ secalif ] , we expect that there exists a realization of the lifshitz algebra , but it is not immediately obvious which gauge parameters one should pick that yield charges satisfying this algebra .",
    "however , motivated by the method of generating diffeomorphisms via gauge transformations , we try the following : @xmath112 these gauge parameters leave the asymptotically lifshitz connections form - invariant because one can show that there exists choices of the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 that lead to these gauge parameters . to see this explicitly ,",
    "notice that given @xmath113 and @xmath114 , if we let @xmath115 denote the gauge parameter @xmath116 of obtained after all @xmath96 and @xmath117 have been substituted for their expressions in terms of @xmath101 and @xmath102 in , hen we have @xmath118 we now have candidates for gauge parameters from which to construct charges that satisfy the lifshitz algebra . using the definition , we find that the expressions for the variations of the charges corresponding to these gauge parameters are integrable and give @xmath119 to determine the poisson algebra of these charges , we recall that for any two gauge parameters @xmath83 and @xmath120 , one has @xcite @xmath121 we assume that the fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 vanish sufficiently rapidly as @xmath122 to ensure that any boundary terms encountered in computing the gauge - variations of the charges vanish .",
    "after some tedious but straightforward calculation , we find that @xmath123 this is precisely the lifshitz algebra . in two dimensions",
    "we expect that the lifshitz algebra will be extended to an infinite - dimensional algebra , in analogy with the extension of global conformal symmetry to a virasoro algebra .",
    "a proposal for an infinite - dimensional extension of the lifshitz symmetry was made in @xcite and can be investigated using the chern - simons formulation .",
    "[ sec4 ]    the most general solutions of the chern - simons theory have connections @xmath124 and @xmath125 which are independent .",
    "we relate the barred and unbarred charges by setting @xmath126 leaving the solutions to be characterized by only by the unbarred connection @xmath127 .",
    "consequently , the expression for the metric is diagonal , i.e. the @xmath128 component of the metric vanishes .      restricting ourselves to @xmath129 chern - simons , we start with a generalization of the ansatz , in which we allow for source terms as coefficients of the generators @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the temporal components of the connections .",
    "this changes the asymptotics , but as we will see presently , this extra freedom will allow us to interpret the resulting solutions as finite energy excitations above the asymptotic lifshitz vacuum .",
    "we also restrict our attention to coordinate - independent connection coefficients .",
    "our general ansatz for the unbarred sector is @xmath132 notice that the ansatz , of the last section is a special case of this ansatz obtained by setting @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in order for this ansatz to be a solution of our theory we need to impose the flatness conditions which constrain the connections ;",
    "@xmath135 these conditions seems to indicate that a flat solution is specified by parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "however we have not fixed all the gauge freedom , and some of these parameters are gauge artifacts . in order to see which of these parameters are the charges and sources of the theory and wich of them can be gauged away , it suffices to look at the only gauge invariant quantities of the theory : the holonomies .",
    "a quick inspection of the holonomies around the thermal and angular cycles shows that the following quantities distinguish different solutions @xmath138 under these identifications we will interpret @xmath139 and @xmath140 as sources and their conjugate charges .",
    "we will expand on this interpretation in section [ i1i2 ] .",
    "finally , to obtain a generic solution for the barred sector , we take @xmath141 replacing @xmath142 by @xmath143 and @xmath144 , @xmath145 by @xmath146 and @xmath147 . limiting out attention to non non - rotating solutions implies setting @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "note that for a non - vanishing source @xmath151 , the connection has a nonzero @xmath131 component and does not satisfy the criterion for an asymptotically lifshitz connection .",
    "this indicates that the source @xmath151 deforms the lifshitz vacuum just as in the case of the higher spin cfts .      in the context of chern - simons higher spin theories ,",
    "black hole solutions need to satisfy certain holonomy conditions and should have a thermodynamical interpretation @xcite .",
    "in particular , the requirement of a smooth euclidean geometry implies that the thermal holonomy of the chern - simons connection is trivial ; @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the @xmath21 identity , and the thermal cycle is from @xmath154 to @xmath155 .",
    "this condition can be recast in more than one equivalent way .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath156 , and noting that @xmath156 is constant , we find that the condition of a trivial thermal holonomy is equivalent to the following condition on the eigenvalues @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 of @xmath156 ; @xmath160 this means that each eigenvalue of @xmath156 must be an integer . since @xmath161 is an element of @xmath162 , it must be traceless , and this gives a second requirement on the eigenvalues ; they must sum to zero .",
    "@xmath163 the simplest nontrivial solution is then @xmath164 .",
    "this solution contains the famous btz black hole and its higher spin generalizations studied in @xcite .    in order to find black hole solutions",
    "one demands that the connections and obey and .",
    "these conditions can be cast in a computationally convenient light . employing the cayley - hamilton theorem",
    ", we note that every 3-by-3 complex matrix @xmath165 satisfies its own characteristic polynomial .",
    "this means that there exist complex numbers @xmath166 for which @xmath167 in particular , this allows one to compute any integer power of @xmath165 knowing only the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial , and therefore allows for evaluation of the matrix exponential of @xmath165 in terms of these coefficients . in the special case that",
    "@xmath165 is traceless , which is the case for the argument of the exponential in the thermal holonomy , there are simple expressions for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial , which therefore serve to determine the thermal holonomy completely ; @xmath168 applying this to the triviality condition , we find that the eigenvalues of @xmath156 are related to the characteristic polynomial coefficients ; @xmath169 in the case of , for example , the btz black hole , with @xmath164 one obtains @xmath170 in the context of finding a higher spin lifshitz black hole solutions , we see no compelling reason to choose the btz holonomy conditions over others , but we do so anyway because they are simple and non - trivial . in principle , however , any conditions on the eigenvalues @xmath171 satisfying and should give rise to independent solutions . applying the conditions to our solution , we obtain the following holonomy conditions : @xmath172 these two equations can be used to solve for any two of @xmath173 in terms of the remaining two . in the next section we shall argue that thermodynamically @xmath174 and @xmath175 are charges and @xmath139 are the conjugate potentials .",
    "since the black holes we are studying are gravitational solutions , we need to check that the chern - simons theory provides a correct variational principle .",
    "let @xmath176 denote the euclidean chern - simons action .",
    "the on - shell , euclidean action @xmath177 , namely the action in which the equations of motion have been used , is given by a boundary term @xmath178 and evaluating the action on our non - rotating connections gives @xcite ; @xmath179 however @xmath177 does not obey a thermodynamically sensible variational principle because the on - shell variation of @xmath176 is @xmath180 the third term spoils the identification of @xmath139 with sources having conjugate charges @xmath181 and @xmath182 . as discussed in @xcite , in the context of the higher spin black holes , it is possible to obtain a canonical action @xmath183 that is thermodynamically sensible by adding a boundary term to @xmath176 .",
    "when we evaluate @xmath183 on our non - rotating solutions , we obtain @xmath184 and it has the corresponding on - shell variaton @xmath185 this relation follows directly from the holonomy conditions and . taking derivatives of the conditions with respect to the sources , one can show that @xmath186 using these expression one can easily show that that @xmath139 are conjugate to @xmath181 and @xmath79 respectively ; @xmath187 the following integrability relation follows immediately from the equality of mixed partial derivatives : @xmath188 the entropy @xmath189 is naturally a function of the charges @xmath190 .",
    "it can can be obtained by performing a legendre transform of @xmath191 with respect to the conjugate variables @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "@xmath192 moreover , using the holonomy conditions one can easily verify that the following inverse thermodynamic relations are : @xmath193      recall that for any thermodynamic system , the grand potential is defined as follows in terms of the thermal partition function : @xmath194 using the saddle point approximation , we identify the on - shell , euclidean chern - simons action with the log of the partition function , so we obtain @xmath195 the thermodynamic potential @xmath196 is associated with the grand canonical ensemble and has as natural variables the temperature @xmath197 and the chemical potential @xmath198 .",
    "these can be related to @xmath139 as follows .",
    "in euclidean signature we have chosen the periodicity of the euclidean time circle to be @xmath199 .",
    "a different euclidean periodicity @xmath200 is equivalent to keeping the periodicity equal to @xmath199 and rescaling @xmath161 by a factor of @xmath200 .",
    "this leads us to re - express the potentials @xmath139 in terms of @xmath200 ( or the temperature @xmath197 ) and a higher spin potential @xmath198 .",

    "we will express the intensive parameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 in terms of the extensive parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "note that due to the nonlinear nature of the holonomy conditions , there will be multiple branches which can be interpreted as different phases of the theory .    in order to simplify the calculation",
    "it proves useful to replace @xmath145 by a parameter @xmath214 which is given by @xmath215 we utilize to replace @xmath139 in the first holonomy condition by derivatives of the entropy with respect to @xmath181 and @xmath214 .",

    "hence the physical interpretation of the quantities and physical reasonableness constraints ( such as positive temperature ) are different .",
    "it is interesting to study the high temperature limit of these solutions .",
    "branch i can not reach high temperatures at fixed @xmath198 .",
    "however , in the high @xmath198 limit , the temperature can be arbitrarily high at the point of maximum entropy .",
    "this point is defined by a concrete value of @xmath214 , so the high @xmath198 limit can only be reached by taking @xmath174 to infinity , as can be seen by looking at equations . in that case",
    "the temperature grows like @xmath174 while the entropy grows like @xmath228 .",
    "this implies @xmath229 the same can be checked for branch iv . in the limit of high temperature",
    ", one finds that @xmath230 hence for negative @xmath198 we obtain again @xmath231 this temperature scaling and is expected for a theory dual to a quantum field theory with @xmath56 anisotropic lifshitz scaling symmetry in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "local thermodynamical stability is associated with the subadditivity of the entropy , as discussed in @xcite this condition is equivalent to demanding that the hessian matrices of @xmath232 and @xmath233 are positive definite .",
    "@xmath234 which matrix one has to consider depends on whether one describes the thermodynamic state of the system in terms of extensive parameters @xmath235 or intensive parameters @xmath236 respectively .    in the case of our lifshitz black hole solution , the extensive parameters can be regarded as the charges @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while the intensive parameters can be regarded as @xmath200 and @xmath237 .",
    "evaluation of the eigenvalues of the hessian @xmath238 for the @xmath219 branch shows that this condition ca nt be satisfied for any value of @xmath174 and @xmath175 , so the @xmath219 branch is locally unstable .",
    "demanding positive definiteness of the hessian for the @xmath227 branch requires that @xmath239 .",
    "this is exactly the regime of @xmath214 covered by the curve representing branch i in figure [ fig : intensiveplots ] .",
    "one can further check that this result is consistent with the description in terms of potentials .",
    "computation of the eigenvalues of @xmath240 for the four branches studied in section [ sec : sta ] , indeed shows that branch i is locally stable , while ii is not .",
    "we now investigate the question whether a gauge exists in which the metric of the lifshitz black hole solutions displays a regular horizon .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate that for some branches one can maintain radial gauge and choose some of the residual gauge such that @xmath241 contains a double zero and @xmath242 is regular .",
    "we begin again with the ansatz , and the flatness conditions , where again the barred sector is determined by the non - rotating condition @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we also regard equations as a reparametrization of @xmath245 and @xmath246 as functions of the charges and potentials @xmath247 and the residual gauge parameter @xmath248 .",
    "next , we solve for the value of @xmath248 for which the corresponding metric derived from has a double zero in @xmath241 at some value of @xmath249 , the location of the corresponding horizon . to do this",
    ", first we note that the metric component @xmath241 can be written as @xmath250 where @xmath251 are @xmath32-independent coefficients given by @xmath252 it is clear that @xmath241 is zero if and only if each term in parentheses on the right hand side of is zero for the same value of @xmath253 which implies that @xmath254 . using the expressions above for @xmath255 , this constraint is equivalent to the following cubic equation for @xmath248 : @xmath256 the three solutions are given by @xmath257 with @xmath258 . however the only solution with a positive and real horizon @xmath259{p_2/p_1}=\\sqrt{p_4/p_3}$ ] is the one with @xmath260 , which can be simplified to @xmath261    the horizon is then located at @xmath262 it seems that we did not need to impose the holonomy conditions in order to find this black hole gauge .",
    "however , we still need to check that the metric and the spin three field in this gauge are smooth around the cycle @xmath263 .",
    "this implies the following conditions @xmath264 direct substitution of the charges and sources for the six branches found in previous sections shows that only the @xmath265 cases satisfy these identities .",
    "this can mean that this gauge is appropriate for those two solutions , while the other branches require giving up the radial gauge chosen in equation . as we have argued in section [ sec : branches ] , the @xmath266 branch does not seem to be physically sensible . for this reason we will focus our attention in branch @xmath227 .",
    "the values of the spin fields at the horizon in this branch obey the following relations @xmath267 so we can recast our expresion for the entropy as @xmath268\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath269 which is very similar to the entropy formula found for asymptotically ads higher spin black holes @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the local thermodynamic instability of the @xmath219 branch discussed in section [ localstability ] and the absence of a regular horizon are related .",
    "however , it is an open and interesting question , if for the @xmath219 branch there is a more general radial gauge choice ( along the lines of @xcite ) which has a regular horizon .",
    "[ sec5 ] in this section we will present some observations on possible generalizations of our @xmath21 results obtained in the previous sections .      in the present paper we have limited ourselves to non - rotating solutions , for which the connections @xmath124 and @xmath125 are related by equation . since the two chern - simons connections @xmath270 are independent , it is clear that constructing a solution with angular momentum entails lifting the condition .",
    "this also means that there will be two holonomy conditions [ trivhol ] for the @xmath124 and the @xmath125 connection . recall that in the @xmath0 black hole first discussed in @xcite a rotating higher spin black hole is obtained by choosing modular parameter to be complex @xmath271 , where @xmath272 is the potential dual to the angular momentum .",
    "for the lifshitz black holes this can not work quite the same way and we present some observations here .",
    "note that in the holographic dictionary or the stress energy complex of a lifshitz theory the angular momentum ( i.e. the momentum along the @xmath35 direction if we take @xmath35 to be compact ) is identified with @xmath273 , whose conjugate potential is @xmath274 and the energy is identified with @xmath275 , whose conjugate potential is @xmath276 .",
    "hence it is likely that a rotating solution can be constructed by choosing a connections with @xmath277 and keeping the indentification of the temperature @xmath200 the same as in the non - rotating case .",
    "the expressions for the metric and higher spin fields are much more complicated .",
    "this implies also that the analysis of the black hole gauge done section [ bhgauge ] becomes more involved , and we leave these questions for future work .",
    "we also note that , to our knowledge , no rotating lifshitz black hole solutions have been constructed using the standard supergravity actions .",
    "hence constructing such solutions in higher spin gravity might be interesting .",
    "in this section we discuss some steps in generalizing the construction of lifshitz black holes from @xmath21 to @xmath20 , note that this generalization will also include the case of @xmath13 by choosing @xmath278 , where the infinite - dimensional lie algebra reduces to @xmath13 .",
    "our conventions for @xmath20 are summarized in appendix [ hslamconv ] .",
    "a lifshitz vacuum in the @xmath20 theory can be easily constructed as follows @xmath279 note that since @xmath280_\\star=0 , \\quad \\quad [ v_{-1}^2 , v^s_{-(s-1)}]_\\star=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this satisfies the flatness condition for a connection in the radial gauge .",
    "the gauge connections @xmath281 and the metric are obtained from by adapting the formulae and using @xmath282 it follows that the metric is of the form .",
    "@xmath283 hence we can realize an asymptotically lifshitz metric in the @xmath20 theory for any @xmath284 , by setting @xmath285 .",
    "note that some higher spin fields will be non - vanishing for this @xmath20 lifshitz vacuum . by setting @xmath278 , the infinite - dimensional @xmath20 gauge algebra truncates to a finite - dimensional @xmath13 , and the connections give lifshitz vacua with @xmath286 .      here",
    "we limit ourself to the bh for @xmath56 , which is related to the @xmath20 black hole with a chemical potential for the spin three charge , which is most extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the connection is given by @xmath287 here , @xmath288 , etc are associated with charges of spin @xmath289 .",
    "we have tilded all quantities to distinguish them from the quantities appearing in the higher spin black hole reviewed in the appendix [ hslamconv ] .    by construction",
    "the connection satisfied the flatness condition . to define a regular black hole in a higher spin chern - simons theory one has to impose a holonomy condition on the gauge connection around the euclidean time circle .",
    "the holonomy condition which we choose is again that the holonomy is equal to the btz holonomy for the @xmath20 black hole defined in appendix [ hslamconv ] .",
    "one might object that in the case of the lifshitz bh this condition seems less well motivated since there is no analog of a btz black hole for an asymptotically lifshitz spacetime , however a better way to think about this is that the btz holonomy simply states that the holonomy of the bh is in the center of @xmath20 ( see gaberdiel:2013jca for a discussion on how the center of @xmath20 is defined ) .",
    "if we compare the holonomy associated with @xmath156 defined in and the higher spin black hole holonomy one recognizes that they are the same upon the following identifications @xmath290 furthermore the charges can also be identified @xmath291 since there is a one - to - one map of parameters one might ask how this can be different than the @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the answer lies in the fact that while ( this was true for the @xmath21 case too ) the holonomy conditions have the same functional form , the interpretations of @xmath292 and @xmath293 are different .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath200 and the chemical potential @xmath294 can be related to @xmath295 and @xmath293 following the the @xmath21 lifshitz black hole example @xmath296 this means that the most natural regime for the lifshitz black hole , i.e. @xmath297 finite and @xmath294 small , is not the same regime as the one which allows the perturbative solution of the holonomy conditions first obtained in @xcite . indeed",
    "if we take the limit @xmath298 , this is equivalent for the higher spin black hole to taking the limit @xmath299 and keeping @xmath198 finite , i.e. taking an infinite temperature limit and finite chemical potential .",
    "[ sec6 ]    in this paper we have discussed the construction of holographic spacetimes dual to field theory with lifshitz @xmath56 scaling symmetry . in addition we have constructed black hole solutions in these theories",
    ". one interesting feature of these theories is that the connections , holonomy conditions and thermodynamic relations are all very similar to the higher spin black holes first constructed in @xcite . this can be traced back to the fact that the lifshitz black hole connections and the higher spin black hole connections are related by replacing @xmath300 by @xmath301 respectively .",
    "note however that the interpretation of the parameters is quite different .",
    "first , the holographic identification of the stress energy complex of the qft with lifshitz symmetry and the role of the fields @xmath181 and @xmath182 are quite different for the lifshitz theory compared to the @xmath302 cft .",
    "second , for the lifshitz black hole solutions the identification of the temperature and higher spin chemical potential is in some sense reversed compared to the higher spin black hole , this leads to a different interpretation of the thermodynamics .",
    "the solution of the holonomy conditions has different branches , which we can interpret as different thermodynamic phases .",
    "we have shown that only one branch ( branch i of section [ sec : sta ] ) has 1 .",
    "positive entropy and 2 .",
    "positive temperature , 3 .",
    "is locally thermodynamically stable and 4 . enjoys a radial gauge with a regular horizon .",
    "all other branches do not satisfy one or more of these conditions and are therefore physically not satisfying .",
    "we have briefly discussed generalizations of the black hole solutions found in this paper .",
    "it would be interesting to study lifshitz black hole solutions in @xmath20 further , since there exists a concrete proposal for a dual cft and the lifshitz theories could be interpreted as deformations of the cft .",
    "furthermore since it is possible to couple scalar matter consistently there are independent probes of the geometry of the black hole . to make progress one has to solve the holonomy conditions",
    "either exactly or maybe less ambitiously determine wether it is possible to solve the holonomy conditions perturbatively for small @xmath294 and finite temperature .",
