    "a carbon / oxygen flame propagating outward from the center of a white dwarf is subjected to a number of instabilities that wrinkle and accelerate the flame .",
    "if the flame can accelerate to a significant fraction of the speed of sound , a deflagration alone can account for the explosion ( see @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "one such instability , the landau - darrieus ( ld ) instability @xcite affects a planar flame front , even in the absence of gravity , driven by the thermal expansion across the flame .",
    "the ld unstable flame will wrinkle , eventually forming cusps in the nonlinear regime that stabilize the flame .",
    "the growth rate for a ld unstable flame , including the effects of the finite thickness of the flame , @xmath0 , is @xmath1\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath2 is the density ratio across the flame , @xmath3 is the wavenumber , @xmath4 is the laminar flame speed , and @xmath5 is the markstein number . the markstein number is a measure of the response of the flame speed , @xmath6 , to curvature , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position of the flame interface and @xmath9 is the transverse coordinate .",
    "we note that our sign convention for @xmath5 is opposite that used in @xcite ( see @xcite for a discussion of the markstein number for astrophysical flames ) .",
    "this growth rate has been confirmed experimentally @xcite for chemical flames . in this paper , we present two - dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the ld instability for low - density c / o flames in white dwarf interiors .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing previous ld simulations and results relevant for thermonuclear flames .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the non - linear regime of the ld instability analytically and numerically , using an integro - differential equation to describe the deformation of a discontinuous flame front .",
    "this was extended later by @xcite , who concentrated on the regime where thermal conduction dominates over mass diffusion ( this is the regime appropriate for astrophysical flames ) .",
    "they experiment with boundary conditions ( both adiabatic and periodic ) and discuss the influence of the domain size on the final cusp behavior .",
    "their simulations show a multi - mode perturbation cusping , and slowly , the cusps merging until only a single one survives . in the widest domains ,",
    "a superimposed cellular structure appears on the single remaining cusp .",
    "the mechanism behind this cellular instability does not , at this moment , seem to be well understood ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "a similar approach , using a more general equation for the front , the frankel equation , considering spherically expanding flames , was performed by @xcite .",
    "they observe a fractal structure for the front through a range of spatial scales .",
    "the unstable flame exhibits cell - splitting , owing to the expanding spherical geometry .",
    "@xcite presented simulations that treat the fuel and ash states as incompressible , and link them with jump conditions across the discontinuous front .",
    "in contrast to other methods , feedback between the flame and fluid flow is included in this model .",
    "they found that the flow dominates the ld instability in setting the scale for the wrinkling .",
    "this has important consequences for the flame in type ia supernova ( sne ia ) , as the medium will be turbulent , and some evidence suggests that a large - scale dipole flow is setup during the ignition phase of the explosion @xcite . in the real star , it may be likely that the fluid motions swamp any effects of the ld instability .",
    "furthermore , the ld instability will be competing with the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .",
    "recently , front tracking methods treating a discontinuous flame coupled to full hydrodynamics have been used for both terrestrial @xcite and astrophysical flames @xcite to investigate ld unstable flames .",
    "the work of @xcite used a level set method coupled to fully compressible ppm @xcite to follow a discontinuous flame front , using flame speeds from @xcite . in their highest resolution run , they report seeing a cellular structure distorting the single cusp , perhaps arising through the same process as described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the flame speed rising to @xmath10 the laminar speed .",
    "the work described above all treat the flame as a discontinuous front  some model is required to describe the behavior of the flame on scales smaller than the grid resolution .",
    "the finite thickness of the flame is known to have some influence on the ld instability , such as setting the small scale cutoff for the growth , so simulations that resolve the thermal structure are important .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the ld instability at various densities in the astrophysical context were performed by @xcite , showing cusp formation , but it was unclear from their studies whether there was any acceleration over the laminar speed .",
    "their lowest density flame ( @xmath11 ) showed significant growth beyond simple cusping , but it is likely that this was either numerical in origin , or due to the interaction of the transient perturbations left over from the initialization with the flame .",
    "ld unstable flames in laminar flows are unlikely alone to lead to the accelerations required of the sne ia models .",
    "an interesting question is whether the non - linear stabilization can break down , whether through some property intrinsic to the flames or through external forces .",
    "@xcite discusses one such mechanism , active turbulent combustion , involving the interaction of the ld unstable flame with turbulence .",
    "it has been proposed that this process could occur in type ia supernovae @xcite , since large amounts of the thermonuclear energy released goes into the expansion of the star , and it is this thermal expansion that drives the ld instability .",
    "@xcite argue that this feedback between the flame and its own turbulence could lead to large accelerations of the flame , although , at present , this has not been demonstrated in numerical simulations .",
    "we focus on dns of the landau - darrieus instability at low densities ( @xmath12  @xmath13 ) using a low mach number numerical formulation , as described in @xcite .",
    "here we are able to extend to lower densities than previous studies , and also , through the use of adaptive mesh refinement , use finer resolution and larger domains . for the present study ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to two - dimensional calculations . these direct numerical simulations are truly parameter free ( i.e. , no laminar flame speed is input ) , and could serve to test / calibrate different methods of representing unresolved flames on stellar - sized domains .",
    "corresponding dns calculations of the rayleigh - taylor instability will be presented in a second paper @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional results will be presented in a future paper . additionally , we do not look to seed the flow with turbulence in the present study , but rather choose to focus solely on the pure ld instability .",
    "we provide a brief description of the numerics and parameters used for the present simulations in  [ sec : numerics ] . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss the results , and finally , in  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "the evolution was carried out using a low mach number formulation of the euler equations , as described in @xcite .",
    "the low mach number formulation takes advantage of the fact that for slow moving flames , the pressure is constant across the flame front , to a high degree . scaling the state variables and expanding them in powers of mach number , keeping terms to @xmath14 @xcite yields a system of equations whose numerical stability condition is set by the fluid velocity alone , instead of the flow velocity plus sound speed .",
    "the pressure is decomposed into a dynamic and thermodynamic component , the ratio of which is of @xmath14 , with only the dynamic component appearing in the momentum equation .",
    "the equation of state is enforced by requiring the pressure to be constant along particle paths , resulting in an elliptic constraint on the velocity field , completing the system of equations .",
    "for the flames we consider in the present paper , @xmath15 , so this approximation is valid .",
    "this allows for timesteps that are @xmath16 ) , larger than a corresponding compressible code .",
    "the low mach number equations are solved via a second - order , fractional - step advection / projection / reaction procedure .",
    "the advection step advances the fluid variables to the new timestep and finds a provisional velocity field that does not yet satisfy the elliptic constraint .",
    "the new velocities are found by projecting this velocity field onto the space that discretely satisfies the elliptic constraint .",
    "reactions are included via strang - splitting .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the full details of the numerical method , as it is unchanged for the present study .",
    "laminar astrophysical flames computed with this code were compared to the benchmark calculations presented in @xcite , and found to be in good agreement .",
    "the calculations we present here differ from the fully compressible ppm @xcite method used in @xcite in several fundamental ways .",
    "first , the low mach number formulation yields a timestep constraint that depends only on the fluid velocity , not the fluid velocity and sound speed as in the compressible case .",
    "this means that we can take much larger timesteps , which for very slow moving flames , greatly reduces the accumulation of error .",
    "additionally , the advection algorithm we employ is not dimensionally split , reducing the influence of the grid on the flame .",
    "finally , the two dimensional domain is initialized by mapping a steady state flame in a perturbed fashion onto the grid , rather than perturbing an interface between fuel and ash and waiting for the flame to develop .",
    "this significantly reduces the transients and leaves the flow ahead of the flame unperturbed .",
    "an equation of state with degenerate / relativistic electrons and positrons , ideal gas ions , and boltzmann radiation was used , as described in @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity is described in @xcite .",
    "a single reaction,@xmath17c(@xmath17c,@xmath18)@xmath19 mg , is followed , using the unscreened rate from @xcite .",
    "this accounts for the bulk of the energy generation in a c / o flame .",
    "furthermore , at the densities we are considering , burning is expected to terminate at intermediate mass elements , so stopping at @xmath19 mg is reasonable . for this simple burning rate ,",
    "we ignore the effects of the oxygen on the energy generation ",
    "it is only advected passively here .",
    "the temperatures reached behind the flame at these densities are @xmath20  k. at these temperatures , oxygen burning is several orders of magnitude slower than carbon , and we would not expect any effects from it on the timescales that we follow the flames .",
    "the properties of the flames we consider here are listed in table  [ table : flameproperties ] .",
    "we will consider the @xmath21 flame to be our reference flame , upon which we will explore the effects of resolution and domain size .    motivated by results indicating that multi - mode perturbations eventually merge into a single dominant cusp ( see for example @xcite ) , we concentrate mainly on single mode perturbations . in all cases ,",
    "the flame is initialized on the grid by mapping a steady - state one - dimensional laminar flame across the grid , shifting it vertically according to the perturbation .",
    "the boundary conditions in all cases are periodic transverse to the flame propagation direction , inflow ahead of the flame , and outflow behind the flame .",
    "the flame is oriented such that it is propagating downward in our domain .",
    "the inflow conditions correspond to the fuel conditions , with the inflow velocity chosen to match the laminar flame velocity .",
    "thus , a flame moving at the laminar speed will remain stationary in the computational domain .",
    "any acceleration resulting from the flame instability will lead to motion across the grid .",
    "the resolution used is chosen to put about 510 zones inside the thermal width , @xmath0 , calculated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the ash and fuel temperatures respectively .",
    "we note that this flame width measure is @xmath25  times narrower than that used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in  [ sec : results ] , we look at the sensitivity of the results to the resolution .",
    "as a motivation for the single mode studies , we look at a single case of a multi - mode perturbation of a @xmath26 flame in a 20.48  cm wide domain .",
    "the flame front was perturbed by shifting the zero point of the initial steady state flame by a sinusoid , with 30 different frequencies , whose phases and amplitudes were chosen randomly .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the perturbation is one flame thickness .",
    "figure  [ fig : ld_4.e7_multimode ] shows the @xmath27-velocity at several instances in time .",
    "we see that immediately , the higher frequency perturbations are washed out , and only the long wavelength modes slowly begin to grow .",
    "several cusps begin to form , but quickly merge , leaving two dominant cusps behind .",
    "these remaining cusps gradually move toward each other ( through the periodic boundary ) , eventually merging , leaving a single dominant cusp behind .",
    "the timescale for the cusps to merge is long , @xmath25  ms , so we show only one case here .",
    "@xcite shows another example , for a pure carbon flame at a higher density , following the evolution for several cusp mergers .",
    "the flame speed can be measured by computing the carbon destruction rate on the grid , taking into account the flow of material through the boundaries : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spatial domain of the burning region , @xmath30 is the width of inflow face , @xmath31 is the inflow carbon mass fraction , and @xmath32 is the rate of consumption of carbon due to nuclear burning .",
    "the rate of change of this quantity in a time interval @xmath33 $ ] is a measure of effective flame velocity : @xmath34 figure  [ fig : ld_4.e7_multimode_speeds ] shows the flame speed as a function of time for the multimode calculation . after an initial , relatively constant velocity period , in which the initial perturbations die out , the flame begins to accelerate rapidly .",
    "the velocity peaks shortly after the leftmost two initial cusps merge , leaving behind two well defined cusps .",
    "a second peak occurs at the merging of these two cusps .",
    "the merging of multiple cusps into a single dominant one has been observed in other planar flame simulations ( see for example @xcite ) , and it seems to be a general feature of the ld instability , with the exception of spherically expanding flames @xcite .",
    "we note however that we see no evidence for a superposed cellular structure on the remaining cusp , but this may be due to domain size restrictions @xcite .",
    "the final cusp that emerges is robust and shows no signs of breaking down .",
    "the main focus of the present study is to look at the acceleration that a flame undergoing the ld instability will experience , in the absence of any external forcing . in particular , we wish to determine whether there is any breakdown of the cusp configuration . since the general consensus is that multimode perturbations in planar domains tend to merge into a single , well defined cusp , we can seed a single mode to study the behavior of this steady state configuration .",
    "table  [ table : singlemodeparams ] list the parameters used for the single - mode calculations .",
    "in addition to a run of densities , we considered the effect of the box width and resolution on the instability for one choice of density ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the reference calculation at this density is a 10.24  cm wide @xmath35 20.48  cm high domain , with a resolution of 6  points in the flame width , @xmath0 .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that this resolution is enough to accurately follow the flame front ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the critical wavelength for the growth of 1/2  carbon , 1/2  oxygen astrophysical flames over a range of densities was computed in @xcite , who , when converted to the flame thickness definition used here , found @xmath36 flame thicknesses to be the small scale cutoff .",
    "if this result holds for the densities we consider here , then for domains narrower than 80 flame widths , we do not expect the ld instability to be able to grow .",
    "we note that our reference domain width is @xmath37 flame widths wide , which should be well above the small scale cutoff for the ld growth .",
    "we will find this small scale cutoff directly by varying our domain width , computing the markstein number , and finding the zeros of the ld dispersion relation , equation  ( [ eq : ld ] ) .",
    "a single sine wave perturbation was used as an offset when mapping the steady state laminar flame profile onto the domain .",
    "figure  [ fig : ld_4.e7 ] shows the @xmath9- and @xmath27- velocities for the reference @xmath26 ld flame once the cusp has become well defined . after this point , the flame front retains this shape . as with the cusps in the multimode simulation , we see that the vertical velocity peaks strongly right behind the cusp , and then drops below the ambient post flame velocity as one moves further away from the flame front .",
    "one thing to note from these velocity figures is how smooth the flow is ahead of and behind the flame .",
    "there is virtually no noise to disturb the pure ld instability .",
    "figure  [ fig : ld_4.e7_vel ] illustrates this by showing two slices of the @xmath27-velocity  through the center of the cusp and the center of the trough  when the cusp is at its maximum .",
    "this behavior is a natural consequence of the local curvature and its effect on the velocity streamlines .",
    "the change in the peak carbon destruction rate as a function of curvature is shown in figure  [ fig : curvature ] .",
    "the curvature was computed by finding the position of the front and taking the second derivative .",
    "we see that the larger the magnitude of the curvature , the greater the carbon destruction rate . at zero curvature ,",
    "the carbon destruction rate is the laminar value .",
    "the scatter in the plot reflects the difficultly in defining the curvature for a discretely defined interface .",
    "figure  [ fig:4.e7_flame_speeds ] shows the flame speed as a function of time for the @xmath26 c / o flame in several different sized domains ( 2.56  cm , 5.12  cm , 10.24  cm , and 20.48  cm ) .",
    "the flame speed was computed by looking at the carbon consumption rate as in equation  ( [ eqn : veff ] ) .",
    "as the box width was varied , we choose to make @xmath38 constant , where @xmath39 is the perturbation amplitude , and w is the box width .",
    "all other parameters ( i.e. , box height , boundary conditions , etc . ) were held constant across the different simulations .",
    "the velocity of the flame for the two widest domains increases quickly and reaches a peak , where it levels off , at a value about 1.6%  higher than the laminar speed .",
    "the slight decrease in the flame speed at late times for the 10.24  cm run is likely a result of the finite vertical extent of the domain .",
    "the 5.12  cm domain run evolves much more slowly .",
    "this domain is @xmath40 flame widths wide , right at the small scale cutoff for the ld instability .",
    "we believe that the slow growth that we see is a manifestation of this cutoff . the narrowest domain ( 2.56  cm )",
    "does not grow at all .",
    "it is not known what accounts for the small difference in the asymptotic flame speeds for the two widest domains .",
    "we can compare the time it takes for the flame speed to saturate to the theoretical prediction of the ld growth rate , equation  ( [ eq : ld ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the cusp is computed by laterally averaging the carbon mass fraction , and finding the positions where it exceeds  0.05 and  0.45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ld_4.e7_cusp ] shows the height of the cusp as a function of time for the 10.24  cm and 20.48  cm wide runs . looking at these plots , there is clearly a regime of linear growth followed by a transition to the nonlinear regime where the cusping halts the growth , and the amplitude reaches a steady state value .",
    "the solid line is a fit to @xmath41 for the interval of @xmath42 to @xmath43  s ( the linear regime ) , which gives @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively  the narrower domain grows faster .",
    "we ignored the very first part of the growth to avoid any transients .",
    "if we were to ignore the effects of curvature and the flame thickness ( i.e. , set @xmath46 in equation  [ [ eq : ld ] ] ) , we would get predictions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for these domains .",
    "thus , the finite thickness of the flame slows down the growth of the ld instability , demonstrating the effects of the curvature on the flame speed .",
    "the finite thickness imposes a small scale cutoff to the ld growth , which we can now compute .",
    "using the flame data from table  [ table : flameproperties ] , we can solve for the markstein number , and find @xmath49 for both of these domain widths .",
    "a negative value is to be expected , as it indicates that a positively curved flame burns more slowly , which is expected for our flames where thermal diffusion dominates mass diffusion @xcite . with this value of the markstein number",
    ", we can plot the growth rate as a function of wavenumber , figure  [ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "we see that the ld stops growing for dimensionless wavenumbers",
    "larger than 0.07 , or domain widths smaller than 5.28  cm .",
    "this is consistent with behavior of the 2.56  cm and 5.12  cm runs we showed above . for this reason",
    ", we do not perform fits to these narrowest domain runs .",
    "the maximum growth should be seen for dimensionless wavenumbers of 0.035 , or a domain with of 10.6  cm .",
    "looking back at figure  [ fig:4.e7_flame_speeds ] , we see that the 10.24  cm run ( our closest domain width to this maximum ) reached the peak velocity quickest and had the largest growth rate ( as determined by the fits to the cusp amplitude growth ) , consistent with the dispersion relation .",
    "this also explains why the multimode perturbation presented above went through an intermediate phase consisting of two cusps .",
    "there , the domain was 20.48  cm wide , and perturbations were made on many length scales .",
    "the dispersion relation predicts that the 10.6  cm perturbations will grow fastest , overwhelming any smaller perturbations .",
    "this means that the mode that we seeded that put two wavelengths in the box would grow the fastest , resulting in the intermediate , moderately long lived state with two cusps .",
    "figure  [ fig:4.e7_res_study ] shows the flame speed vs.  time for the 10.24  cm wide , @xmath26 run at three different resolutions .",
    "the flame speed is normalized to the laminar speed at that resolution to account for the small resolution dependence on this speed .",
    "table  [ table : res_study ] lists the laminar flame speeds for the different resolutions . at the highest resolutions ,",
    "the laminar flame speeds differ by 0.13% , and the normalized velocity vs.  time curves lie on top of one another , demonstrating convergence .",
    "the coarsest resolution laminar flame speed differs by 1.1% , and the evolution with time is clearly not converged .",
    "all the simulations presented in this paper are performed at this middle resolution or higher .",
    "this resolution agrees with that found in the corresponding resolution study in @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig:2.e7_flame_speed ] and [ fig:8.e7_flame_speed ] show the flame speed as a function of time for the @xmath50 and @xmath13 runs respectively .",
    "the evolution at these densities proceeded in much the same way as the @xmath26 run shown in figure  [ fig : ld_4.e7 ] , so we do not show the velocity fields .",
    "only one domain width was used for these calculations , with the size picked close to the wavelength that maximizes the growth rate .",
    "the change in density ( and expansion parameter across the flame ) changes the speedup we get .",
    "the @xmath50 flame accelerates by 2.4% and the @xmath13 flame by 1.1% . together with the results for the @xmath26 flame , we see that the acceleration is larger for the lower density / larger expansion ratio flames",
    ". we can compute the markstein numbers for these flames in the same manner as above and find @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the @xmath50 and @xmath13 flames respectively ( see figures  [ fig:2.e7_cusp ] and  [ fig:8.e7_cusp ] ) .",
    "again , the fit of an exponential to the linear portion of the growth is excellent .",
    "the dispersion relations for these flames are also plotted in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] . to fit them all on the same plot ,",
    "the curves are scaled by the flame speed and width .",
    "the magnitude of the markstein number increases with decreasing density and increasing expansion parameter .",
    "this is not unexpected , and confirms the trend seen in @xcite for similar flames .",
    "this suggests that a lower density flame is harder to bend .    as a final measure of the effects of curvature on the flame speed",
    ", we can compare the growth in the flame surface area to the growth in flame speed . in the simplest model ,",
    "these two are directly related in a purely geometrical fashion , and the flame speed would be simply @xmath53 we can measure the length of the flame surface by counting the number of zone edges where the carbon mass fraction passes through 0.25 .",
    "this measure agrees well with computing the length of a contour as computed with the commercial idl package , after normalization .",
    "since the flame surface is always sharp , this is a well - defined procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : flamelength ] shows the normalized flame length as a function of time for the three different densities ( the 10.24  cm reference run was used for the @xmath26 case ) . in all these cases , the increase in the flame length is several times larger than the increase in the flame speed , showing a strong deviation from the linear scaling of equation  ( [ eq : speed_area])for example , the @xmath26 flame increases in speed by about 1.6% , but the area increase is 12% .",
    "this deviation is due to the effects of the localized curvature .",
    "we note that this deviation is larger in magnitude than that found in the compressible , flame - model calculations of @xcite .",
    "we presented direct numerical simulations of the landau - darrieus instability at low densities in conditions relevant for type ia supernova explosions .",
    "we employed a low mach number hydrodynamics method  new in the application to astrophysics  to advance the flows and enable us to follow the development of the ld instability from the linear regime through the nonlinear regime .",
    "resolving the flame ensures that we account for the full coupling between the flame and the flow and the effects of curvature .",
    "the consistency of our results with the theoretical predictions validate this approximation for astrophysical flames .",
    "fully compressible versions of the same simulations would not be possible , or prohibitively expensive and error prone .",
    "acceleration of the flame was seen , due to the increase of flame surface , until the nonlinear cusp formation sets in , at which point the velocity stabilized a few percent higher than the laminar speed .",
    "the maximum increase in flame speed observed was @xmath54this is in contrast to the results presented in @xcite , where accelerations of @xmath55 were observed .",
    "there are several possible reasons to explain these differences .",
    "most of the numerical results for the ld instability treat the flame as infinitely thin . here",
    "we ve included the effects of the finite thickness of the flame , and therefore , implicitly included curvature effects . at the densities we consider ,",
    "the burning is expected to terminate at the intermediate mass elements , so we burn to magnesium whereas they burn to nickel .",
    "furthermore we use half carbon / half oxygen fuel instead of pure carbon .",
    "this will affect the expansion factor across the flame .",
    "finally , fully understanding the role of the numerics requires a detailed comparison of the different methods , using the same input physics , and could potentially be a research project in the future .",
    "the speedup increases with decreasing density ( or increasing expansion parameter ) , as expected . with time",
    ", it seems as if the velocities asymptote to the same value , for a given density .",
    "when a multimode perturbation is considered , it is observed that the cusps eventually merge into a single cusp .",
    "we were able to perform fits of the growth of the cusp amplitude with time to compute the growth rates . using the theoretical prediction ( equation  [ [ eq : ld ] ] )",
    ", we were able to compute the markstein number for these flames , finding values @xmath56 , and growing in magnitude with decreasing density .",
    "these values and the trend with density are consistent with the results of @xcite . for the @xmath26 density run ,",
    "the large number of domain widths allowed us to compare to the predictions of the fastest growing mode and small scale cutoff from the theoretical dispersion relation , and we found strong agreement .",
    "furthermore , this demonstration of the small scale cutoff and the deviation from the infinitely thin flame ( @xmath46 ) estimates of the growth rate , as well as the difference in the growth of the flame speed and area emphasize the importance of curvature in small - scale flame dynamics .",
    "as we zoom out from these fully resolved flames , several steps will be needed at intermediate scales between the fully resolved flame , where curvature effects appear important , and the full star , with validation of the flame model on each scale through direct comparison to the immediately smaller scale simulations .",
    "the present direct numerical simulations provide the anchor for this subgrid model validation .",
    "these curvature effects will be explored more fully in paper ii , focusing on the reactive rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "we saw no breakdown of the nonlinear stabilization mechanism as hinted to in the calculations presented by @xcite . furthermore , none of the flames we studied showed a superposed cellular structure , although , there is some evidence @xcite that this phenomena is present only on very large scales , and @xcite admit that it may actually be seeded by numerical noise .",
    "the widest domain that we were able to simulate was @xmath57 flame widths .",
    "@xcite only saw this instability when they increased their domain size to 20  times the wavelength where the ld growth rate is the maximum .",
    "this would translate into a domain size of @xmath58  cm for the @xmath26 flame , which would require a 23,000 zone wide simulation if we are to resolve the flame . the growth rate for a domain that wide would be very small , requiring a much longer simulation .",
    "this is very expensive , and furthermore , it is not known if this factor of 20 is universal .",
    "we are not aware of any resolved calculations of the ld instability that have shown this secondary instability .",
    "we note that all of our calculations considered planar geometries only . on the scales where the spherical geometry of the star is likely to make a difference",
    ", the flame will be disturbed by the larger scale motions in the star , other instabilities as well ( notably the rayleigh - taylor instability , presented in @xcite ) and subjected to the interaction with flame - generated turbulence .",
    "all of these processes will dominate the pure ld instability , considered in the present paper .",

    "<S> we show the effect of the instability on the flame speed as a function of both the density and domain size , demonstrate the existence of the small scale cutoff to the growth of the instability , and look for the proposed breakdown of the non - linear stabilization at low densities . </S>",
