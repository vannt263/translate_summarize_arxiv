    "the key , or random bit string , is shared between the two parties , alice and bob , without a third party , eve , gaining any information about the key .",
    "eqkd consists of three parts and three stages .",
    "there is a source of entangled two - level systems , generally pairs of entangled photons produced by down - conversion .",
    "experimentally , this has been preformed for both pulsed and continuous - wave ( cw ) laser systems @xcite",
    ". additionally , there are two detectors each for alice and bob .",
    "the first phase of the protocol consists of data collection .",
    "the source emits a pair and sends one half to alice and one half to bob .",
    "alice and bob each make measurements in one of two orthogonal bases . in the second phase they reconcile the measurements , keeping only the data where they measured in the same basis and they both received a signal .",
    "they now share a noisy key between them .",
    "the final stage is error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "they compare information over an authenticated public classical channel and correct all errors calculating a bit - error rate ( @xmath0 ) value .",
    "it has been shown the eve s information is bounded by this @xmath0 .",
    "they then calculate the amount of privacy amplification necessary and perform the privacy amplification to make eve s information negligible .",
    "the formula @xcite for the amount of secret key generated is    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the number of sifted bits , @xmath3 is the number of dark counts , @xmath4 is an efficiency factor greater than @xmath5 for error correction or privacy amplification resepctivly , and @xmath6 is the binary shannon entropy . in the rate formula shown above , the @xmath0 is the only variable that is difficult to simulate .",
    "@xcite has shown simulations for the @xmath0 and key rate in a system with a pulsed - source laser , which obeys thermal statistics . here",
    ", we expand that technique from pulsed systems to allow for the analysis of continuous - wave ( cw ) laser systems as well as all intermediate ratios of thermal and poissonian statistics . with the expanded technique in place ,",
    "we compare cw and pulsed systems for a variety of realistic experimental parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes how to simulate the @xmath0 for a cw - laser .",
    "section iii shows the results and compares the situations where the source is in alice s enclave or in the middle .",
    "section iv shows how the procedure in section ii can be adjusted for any value from a completely thermal state to a completely poissionian state .",
    "finally , in section v cw - laser systems are compared to pulsed - laser systems .",
    "to calculate the @xmath0 from a cw - laser system , we can use the same method as in @xcite , except with a different initial state due to the fact that we are now considering a cw source .",
    "the initial state for a cw - laser over the time period given by the timing window of alice s and bob s detectors @xcite is    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the unnormalized state of equal superpositions of all states with @xmath9 excitation pairs and @xmath10 modes , @xmath10 is the number of modes available , approximately @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the detector timing window , and @xmath13 is the coherence time of the light field .",
    "the constants @xmath14 are defined as @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 being proportional to the amplitude of the laser pump field .    expressing the unnormalized state @xmath8 in terms of the normalized state @xmath18 ,",
    "requires counting all the ways that @xmath9 indistinguishable pairs may be placed into @xmath10 in principle distinguishable modes .",
    "the normalization is then the square root of the number of nonnegative solutions to @xmath19 ,    @xmath20    since the timing window contains many modes , we count m clicks from all modes the same @xcite",
    ". we can neglect which mode is which and define @xmath21 as the unnormalized state corresponding to the symmetric polynomial m@xmath22 . where @xmath23 is some partition of @xmath9 into @xmath10 pieces ( some may be zero ) representing a particular solution to the equation above . expressing @xmath23 as a multiplicity vector :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the length of the partition . putting it all together    @xmath26",
    "the @xmath0 of the state @xmath27 is a weighted sum of the @xmath0s due to @xmath18 which in turn is a weighted sum of the @xmath0s due to @xmath28 .    for a state @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30",

    "if @xmath37 ( 4 ) ... ( i.e. a thermal state ) then @xmath35 is the number of nonnegative integral solutions to the equation    @xmath38    @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    if @xmath41 ( 1,1,1,1 )",

    "with the @xmath0 of a state in the form of ( eqn .",

    "the maximum pair generation rate cutoff is similar for all cases where the source is in alice s enclave , but increases the losses when the source is placed in the middle . ]",
    "[ graph_amdistance ] shows the secret key generation rate vs distance between alice and bob for a variety of power levels for a system with the source in the middle and for a system with the source inside alice s enclave . with low power ,",
    "having the source in the middle does nt improve the maximum rate significantly . yet , when @xmath66 pairs / s , having the source in the middle improves the distance by @xmath67 km .",
    "another curious part of the plot is the line for @xmath68 pairs / s and the source in the middle .",
    "the key rate is zero for low distances .",
    "counter - intuitively , as the loss in the channel increases the key rate jumps .",
    "this is caused by the fact that at lower losses , the probability that a single timing window will have many photons at both alice s and bob s side is too high and thus the @xmath0 is too high .",
    "it is the ability of cw systems to change the effective mean photon number by changing the timing window , combined with locating the source in the middle , that will give the cw system increased flexibility and further distances than a comparable pulsed system .",
    "as the losses increase , this problem disappears .",
    "when the source is in alice s enclave , the high power will continue to reach her detector regardless of the distance , so the same phenomenon does not occur .",
    "in fact , for @xmath68 pairs / s there is no key generated for the system with the source inside alice s enclave .    the second plot ( fig .",
    "[ graph_ams ] ) shows the secret key generation vs. the pair generation rate . here , one can see the power cutoff for a particular distance more strikingly .",
    "notice that for the system with the source inside alice s enclave all the different distances have a similar cutoff , but for the system with the source in the middle , the cutoffs increase with distance .",
    "the approximation that @xmath69 is an integer and thus that each timing window consists of an integral number of temporal modes is only justified for @xmath70",
    ". it may be useful to use the results of section 2 when this is no longer the case .",
    "one can see that for a pulsed laser with @xmath71 , setting @xmath72 in section @xmath73 should reproduce the pulsed laser system .",
    "putting both of the systems in the same framework allows for easy comparisons between them .",
    "so when @xmath74 , the resultant state may only have one form of young diagram , the horizontal ( [ thermal ] ) . as @xmath75 , the resultant state has a young diagram that approaches vertical ( [ poissionian ] ) .",
    "for the mostly likely error , the 4-photon state , the young diagrams are just ( 2 ) and ( 1,1 ) .",
    "a calculation of the @xmath0 yields @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the thermal and poissionian states , respectively .",
    "however , that does nt mean that poissionian states are worse for qkd .",
    "the other factor is with what probability these multi - pair states occur . to compare the mostly poissionian cw - laser case and the thermal pulsed - laser case",

    "vs the distance for a variety of pair generation rates , for both the cw and the pulsed systems , for the case where the source is in the middle .",

    "when the rates are high , the cutoff is slighty higher for the cw system .",
    "this separation increases with the transmission losses . ]",
    "the third plot is again a plot of the secret key rate vs the distance for many pair generation rate @xmath2 .",
    "both systems had a source in the middle .",
    "the pulsed and cw systems are mostly identical except in the case of high power .",
    "the low loss cutoff is present for both systems , but is worse for the pulsed system .",
    "also with high power the cw system has a positive rate for distances quite a bit further than pulsed systems .",
    "the fourth plot shows both that the improvement in cutoff as distance increases for both systems and that the separation between the cutoff for the pulsed and the cw systems increases as distance increases .",
    "we have presented a method for calculating the expected @xmath0 for a cw - laser eqkd system .",
    "the method consists of three reductions from the state of the light to easier to handle superpositions of states .",
    "first , the light state reduction proceeds from the laser state to a superposition of states with definite excitation number , then to a superposition of partition states . and finally , from a partition state to a superposition of polarization states .",
    "the computationally intensive step is calculating all the weights by means of a loop over all possible partitions of a positive integer .",
    "we find that for lower pair generation rate ( power ) the cw and pulsed systems are very close in terms of secret key generation rates and maximum losses .",
    "when the pair generation rates are high ( much higher than currently available ) there is an advantage to using cw laser systems , if all other experimental parameters for the two systems are the same .",
    "in addition , including both poissonian and thermal statistics allows for more practical simulations of eqkd systems .",
