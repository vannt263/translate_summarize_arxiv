    "operating on quantum many - body systems provide a way to understand the world , so hunting an exactly solved quantum many - body model becomes more important , especially for pair interaction models . over a period of more than seventy years",
    ", there has been much successes in dealing with quantum many - body problems , but only a few models can be solved exactly .",
    "calogero - sutherland ( cs ) model @xcite is one celebrated example of solvable many - body problems .",
    "it has been wide applications in quantum chaos and fractional statistics @xcite . as a special case of cs model , one dimensional system with quadratic pair potentials",
    "was studied by h. r. post @xcite , who obtained the ground state energy .",
    "j. m. levy - leblond @xcite obtained the energy spectrum in one dimension and the ground state energy in three dimension .",
    "zhong - qi ma @xcite considered three particle system and he pointed out that some states were disappeared by antisymmetric operations .",
    "none of them have given the exact eigenfunctions and as we know that eigenfunctions are important for us to compute many kinds of correlations , which motivate us to restudy this system and obtain the exact eigenfunctions .",
    "up to now , calogero - sutherland model is still not a completely solved problem .",
    "calogero @xcite and khare @xcite made a big step forward that they gave partial exact solutions of the calogero - sutherland model , such as the boson and fermion ground state and radial excitations over it . in this article , we will first exhibit the exact eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of n - body bose and fermi systems with quadratic pair potentials in one dimension .",
    "second , we will give our findings of fermi system with quadratic pair potentials in two and higher dimensions .",
    "at last , our results will be compared with the existing results of khare .",
    "the hamiltonian of one dimensional @xmath0-body problems with quadratic pair potentials is @xmath1    with the jacobin coordinates @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance between the center of mass of the first @xmath4 particles and the @xmath5 particle , we have @xmath6 .    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the reduced mass @xmath7 . from equations ( [ 5 ] )",
    "we know that although any two particles interact with each other with a vibration frequency @xmath8 , it can be decomposed into multiple quasi - particle s vibration with a different frequency @xmath9 . without considering the centroid movement ,",
    "the solution of equations ( [ 5 ] ) is @xmath10 where @xmath11^\\frac{1}{2},\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\alpha_i=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_i\\omega'}{\\hbar}}\\,\\ , , \\,\\,\\,\\ , \\omega'=\\sqrt{n}\\omega\\ ] ]    taking the first @xmath4 particles as a system , then @xmath12 can be regarded as the newly emerged hamiltonian while adding another one particle to the system and it is independent with the system constituted by the first @xmath4 particles .    as we all know , bose system should be exchange symmetric , while fermi system should be exchange anti - symmetric .",
    "because of the interactions , it is not easy to get the eigenfunctions of the identical particle systems . the eigenfunctions can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an exchange operator of any two particles or an permutation of all particles . for bose system , @xmath15 ; while for fermi system , @xmath16 take two - particle fermi system as an example , @xmath17    we will use the subscript @xmath18 as the quantum number to constitute the sets @xmath19 to represent the eigenfunction . by calculation , we found such an ansatz :    _ all the states can be obtained by only changing the last quantum number @xmath20 when the system constituted by the first @xmath21 particles is in ground state .",
    "_    i have to declare that every quantum number plays a role in solving the states .",
    "this ansatz , the correctness of which can be tested and verified by substituting the final results into equation ( [ 1 ] ) , is just one way to obtain all the states .    for bose system ,",
    "it is clear that the combination @xmath22 is the ground state of the system constituted by the first @xmath21 particles , so equation ( [ eqn6 ] ) changes to @xmath23    by calculation , we found the energy spectrum and the corresponding ground state and excited state eigenfunctions , @xmath24 @xmath25,\\ ] ] where@xmath26 and @xmath27 is the hermite polynomials .",
    "note that the original existed first excited state or energy level is disappeared and all the states are non - degenerate .    in the following",
    ", we will give the solutions of fermi system briefly . with the ansatz and the principle of mathematical induction",
    ", we can demonstrate that @xmath28 is the ground state wave function of the system .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the normalization constant , satisfying @xmath31 , then @xmath32^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    here we have to clarify that the set @xmath28 is one kind of combinations for the ground - state wave function , but it is not the only one kind that stands for the ground - state wave function . for three - particle system as an example , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both combinations for the ground - state and both of which give the same result as expressed in equation ( [ 12 ] ) when @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it is non - degenerate for the ground - state of three - particle system . from our calculation",
    "we obtain that all states of the system are non - degenerate in one dimension , and this result is against with that of j. m. levy - leblond @xcite .",
    "as all the eigenstates of this system are non - degenerate , we will not consider other possible combinations except @xmath28 to represent the ground state . in the following ,",
    "we calculate all the eigenstates by the mathematical induction .    from equation ( [ eqn11 ] ) ,",
    "we know @xmath36 , which is just in accord with equation ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "we suppose equation ( [ 12 ] ) is right for @xmath37-particle system , then when the particle number of the system is @xmath0 , define @xmath38 from the above ansatz we know all the possible eigenfunctions of @xmath0-particle fermi system could be obtained by solving equation ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "to avoid loss of continuity , we have relegated the process to appendix .",
    "the main results are as follows : + @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 ; for @xmath42 , equation ( [ 12 ] ) is right for the ground state of @xmath0-particle system ; + @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 should be the first excited state , but it is missing , just like the missing of the first excited state of boson system .",
    "we have not manipulated the eigenvectors except for exchanging any two particles coordinates .",
    "it is safe for us to say that exchange symmetry or anti - symmetry result in the loss of the original existed first excited state or energy level .",
    "+ @xmath47 for @xmath48 , we could get all the excited states of the system .",
    "the @xmath49th excited state is @xmath50 , and its eigenfunction is @xmath51\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the elementary symmetric polynomial . for @xmath0-variable polynomials , @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    the fermi exchange anti - symmetry",
    "is reflected in the factor @xmath56 , and it is lucky for us to see this factor appears in all eigenfunctions .",
    "the rest factors that appear in @xmath57 and @xmath58 are all functions of the elementary exchange symmetric polynomials .    from @xmath47 , we know that @xmath59 is one kind of combinations standing for the @xmath4th excited states of @xmath0-particle system .",
    "the exact eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the fermi system with quadratic pair potentials in one dimension are    @xmath60",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath61 with @xmath62 the d - dimensional coordinate vector . for bose system ,",
    "the ground state is just like equation ( 11 ) , except changing @xmath63 to @xmath64 . for fermi system , things are a bit more complicated .",
    "we just obtain the ground state energy and eigenfunction through the summary of the calculated results about fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the correctness of all the following equations can be verified by checking whether they meeting equation ( [ 1 ] ) or not .",
    "@xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the integer obeying @xmath67 the result of j. m. levy - leblond @xcite is a special case for @xmath68 here . for large @xmath0 ,",
    "the result is asymptotically changes to @xmath69^{1/d}+o(n)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] this result is the same as equation ( 20 ) in khare s article @xcite , except the last small amount term .    for the ground state ,",
    "the behavior the these fermions are just like non - interacting fermions occupying the states of a fictitious hamiltonian whose energy levels are divided into different @xmath49 series , @xmath70 , and every @xmath49 series has a suppositional degree of degeneracy of @xmath71 ( it is 1 in one dimension ) .",
    "these non - interacting fermions will be first to fill in the low @xmath49 series energy levels , then continue to fill in the higher energy levels . while the number of fermions @xmath0 is just filled any series to the full , the system is non - degenerate ; while there are @xmath72 fermions left , it equals to choose @xmath72 states from @xmath71 states for the left @xmath72 fermions to occupy , which causes the degeneracy of the realistic hamiltonian .",
    "this fictitious degeneracy result in an interesting fact that , for large particle number fermi system , the value of the ground state energy decreases while the dimension @xmath73 of the system increases . and the relation between the ground state energy , the dimension @xmath73 and the particle number @xmath0 is plotted in figure 1 .     with particle number @xmath0 in different dimensions .",
    "here we set @xmath74    the corresponding ground state eigenfunction is @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 @xmath78 note that @xmath49 is just a serial number standing for the combination @xmath79 , which satisfies @xmath80    in equation ( [ 23 ] ) , the first n lines and the first n columns stands for the first @xmath81 series being filled with fermions . then there are @xmath82 fermions left , so the degeneracy of the ground state is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the binomial coefficient .    for the ground state eigenfunctions of three fermion system in three dimension as an example . from equation (",
    "[ 20 ] ) , we know @xmath85 .",
    "so the degeneracy is 3 , and @xmath86 there are two fermions left to fill the @xmath85 series .",
    "substitute any two of the three @xmath87 into equation ( [ 23 ] ) , three @xmath88 will be obtained correspondingly .",
    "@xmath89    from our calculation , we find some states are missing , but there are no energy levels missing because of the degeneracy .",
    "the exact eigenvalues of the system with quadratic pair potentials in d - dimension are @xmath90    comparing the equation ( [ 22 ] ) with the existing result ( 29 ) in khare s article @xcite , we find that @xmath91 in his article is just the @xmath91 in this article and we make his energy exact because of our exact ground state energy .",
    "we rewrite his hamiltonian and the @xmath0-fermion ground state and radial excitations over it as follows .",
    "@xmath92.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have set @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath94 and @xmath91 are exactly expressed by equation ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) respectively .",
    "we investigate a quantum system of which identical particles interact with each other with quadratic pair potentials . by calculations ,",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions which are non - degenerate and proved that the original first excited state or energy level disappears . in two and higher dimensions ,",
    "we present the energy spectrum and the degree of the ground state and eigenfunctions . for large particle number fermi system , the value of the ground state energy decreases while the dimension increases . through the comparison with avinash khare s results ,",
    "we give the exact expressions of @xmath91 and @xmath95 of the calogero model in his article .",
    "besides these already solved problems , there are also other unsolved problems . for example , the angular excitations of the calogero model",
