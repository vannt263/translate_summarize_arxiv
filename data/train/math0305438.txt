    "+ this contribution deals with the implementation of procedures and methods , worked out in our group during the last few years , in order to provide algorithmic solutions to the problem of determining the first passage time ( fpt ) probability densities ( pdf ) and its relevant statistics for continuous state - space and continuous parameter gaussian processes describing the stochastic modeling of a single neuron s activity .    in most modeling approaches , it is customary to assume that a neuron is subject to input pulses occurring randomly in time , ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . as a consequence of the received stimulations , it reacts by producing a response that consists of a spike train .",
    "the reproduction of the statistical features of such spike trains has been the goal of many researches who have focused the attention on the analysis of the interspike intervals .",
    "indeed , the importance of the interspike intervals is due to the generally accepted hypothesis that the information transferred within the nervous system is usually encoded by the timing of occurrence of neuronal spikes .    to describe the dynamics of the neuronal firing we consider a stochastic process @xmath0 representing the change in the neuron membrane potential between two consecutive spikes ( cf . , for instance , @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the threshold voltage is viewed as a deterministic function @xmath1 and the instant when the membrane potential crosses @xmath1 as a fpt random variable .",
    "the modeling of a single neuron s activity by means of a stochastic process has been the object of numerous investigations during the last four decades . a milestone contribution in this direction",
    "is the much celebrated paper by gerstein and mandelbrot @xcite in which a random walk and its continuous diffusion limit ( the wiener process ) was proposed with the aim of describing a possible , highly schematized , spike generation mechanism .",
    "however , despite the excellent fitting of a variety of data , this model has been the target of severe criticism on the base of its extreme idealization in contrast with some electrophysiological evidence : for example , this model does not take into account the spontaneous exponential decay of the neuron membrane potential .",
    "an improved model is the so called ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) model , that embodies the presence of such exponential decay .",
    "however , the ou model does not allow to obtain any closed form expression for the firing pdf , except for some very particular cases of no interest within the neuronal modeling context .",
    "rather cumbersome computations are thus required to obtain evaluations of the statistics of the firing time .",
    "successively , alternative neuronal models have been proposed , that include more physiologically features .",
    "the literature on this subject is too vast to be recalled here .",
    "we limit ourselves to mentioning that a review of most significant neuronal models can be found in @xcite , @xcite and in the references therein .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it is presented an outline of appropriate mathematical techniques by which to approach the fpt problem in the neuronal context .",
    "we shall now formally define the firing pdf for a model based on a stochastic process @xmath0 with continuous sample paths .",
    "first , assume @xmath2=1 $ ] , with @xmath3 i.e. we view the sample paths of @xmath0 as originating at a preassigned state @xmath4 at initial time @xmath5 .",
    "then , @xmath6 is the fpt of @xmath0 through @xmath1 , and @xmath7 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } p(t_{x_0 } < t)\\ ] ] is its pdf .",
    "henceforth , the fpt pdf @xmath8 $ ] will be identified with the firing pdf of a neuron whose membrane potential is modeled by @xmath0 and whose firing threshold is @xmath1 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we shall focus our attention on neuronal models rooted on diffusion and gaussian processes , partially motivated by the generally accepted hypothesis that in numerous instances the neuronal firing is caused by the superposition of a very large number of synaptic input pulses which is suggestive of the generation of gaussian distributions by virtue of some sort of central limit theorems .",
    "it must be explicitly pointed out that models based on diffusion processes are characterized by the lack of memoryas a consequence of the underlying markov property . however , in the realistic presence of correlated input stimulations , the markov assumption breaks down and one faces the problem of considering more general stochastic models , for which the literature on fpt problem appears scarce and fragmentary .",
    "simulation procedures then provide possible alternative investigation tools especially if they can be implemented on parallel computers , ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of a typical simulation procedure is to sample @xmath9 values of the fpt by a suitable construction of @xmath9 time - discrete sample paths of the process and then to record the instants when such sample paths first cross the boundary .",
    "in such a way , one is led to obtain estimates of the firing pdf and of its statistics , that may be implemented for data fitting purposes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to outline numerical and theoretical methods to characterize the fpt pdf for gaussian processes .",
    "attention will be focused on markov models in section [ section2 ] , and on non - markov models in section [ section3 ] .",
    "finally , section [ section4 ] will be devoted to the description of some computational results .",
    "+ we start briefly reviewing some essential properties of gauss - markov processes .",
    "let @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a continuous parameter set , be a real continuous gauss - markov process with the following properties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    _ ( i ) _ : :    @xmath12 $ ] is continuous in @xmath11 ; _ ( ii ) _ : :    the covariance    @xmath13\\,[x(t)-m(t)]\\bigr\\}$ ] is    continuous in @xmath14 ; _ ( iii ) _ : :    @xmath0 is non - singular , except possibly at the end points    of @xmath11 where it could be equal to @xmath15 with    probability one .",
    "a gaussian process is markov if and only if its covariance satisfies @xmath16 it is well known @xcite , that well - behaved solutions of ( [ eq:(2.1 ) ] ) are of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a monotonically increasing function by virtue of the cauchy - schwarz inequality , and @xmath19 because of the assumed nonsingularity of the process on @xmath11 .",
    "the conditional pdf @xmath20 of @xmath0 is a normal density characterized respectively by conditional mean and variance @xmath21\\\\ v(t|t_0 ) & = & h_2(t)\\,\\biggl[h_1(t)-{h_2(t)\\over h_2(t_0)}\\;h_1(t_0)\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 .",
    "it satisfies the fokker - planck equation and the associated initial condition @xmath23+{1\\over 2}\\;{\\partial^2 \\over \\partial x^2}\\ ; [ a_2(t)\\,f(x , t|y,\\tau)],\\\\ \\\\ & & \\lim_{\\tau \\uparrow t}\\,f(x , t|y,\\tau)=\\delta(x - y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 and @xmath25 given by @xmath26\\;{h_2^{\\prime}(t)\\over h_2(t)}\\,,\\qquad a_2(t ) = h_2 ^ 2(t)\\;r^{\\prime}(t),\\ ] ] the prime denoting derivative with respect to the argument .    the class of the gauss - markov processes @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 is characterized by means and covariances of the following two forms :    @xmath29 @xmath30 + @xmath31    or    @xmath29 @xmath32 $ ] + @xmath33 .",
    "the first type includes the wiener process , used in @xcite to describe the neuronal firing , while the second type includes the ornstein  uhlenbeck process that has often been invoked as a model for neuronal activity ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    any gaussian process with covariance as in ( [ eq:(2.2 ) ] )",
    "can be represented in terms of the standard wiener process @xmath34 as @xmath35 , \\label{eq:(2.4)}\\ ] ] and is therefore markov .",
    "this last equation suggests the way to construct the fpt pdf of a gauss - markov process @xmath0 in terms of the fpt pdf of the standard wiener process @xmath36 as an example , from ( [ eq:(2.4 ) ] ) for the conditioned fpt pdf one has : @xmath7 = { dr(t)\\over dt}\\;g_w\\bigl\\{s^*[r(t)],r(t)|x_0^*,r(t_0)\\bigr\\ } , \\label{eq:(2.12)}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is defined in ( [ eq:(2.3 ) ] ) and @xmath38 $ ] is the fpt pdf of @xmath39 from @xmath40 at time @xmath41 to the continuous boundary @xmath42 , with @xmath43 \\over h_2[r^{-1}(\\vartheta_0)]},\\qquad s^*(\\vartheta)={s[r^{-1}(\\vartheta)]-m[r^{-1}(\\vartheta ) ] \\over h_2[r^{-1}(\\vartheta)]}\\,.\\ ] ] results on the fpt pdf for the standard wiener process can thus in principle be used via ( [ eq:(2.12 ) ] ) to obtain the fpt pdf of any continuous gauss - markov process .",
    "for instance , if @xmath42 is linear in @xmath44 , @xmath38 $ ] is known and @xmath8 $ ] can be obtained via ( [ eq:(2.12 ) ] ) . instead",
    ", if @xmath38 $ ] is not known , a numerical algorithm , or a simulation procedure , should be used for the standard wiener process and , after that , @xmath8 $ ] can be obtained via the indicated transformation .",
    "the above procedure often exhibits the serious drawback of ensuing unacceptable time dilations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , exponentially large times are involved when transforming the ornstein - uhlenbeck process to the wiener process , which makes such a method hardly viable .",
    "hence , it is desirable to dispose of a direct and efficient computational method to obtain evaluation of the firing pdf .",
    "along such a direction , in @xcite it has been proved that the conditioned fpt density of a gauss - markov process can be obtained by solving the non - singular volterra second kind integral equation @xmath45 \\!=\\ ! - 2 \\psi[s(t),t|x_0,t_0 ] + 2 \\int_{t_0}^t\\ !",

    "an efficient numerical procedure based on a repeated simpson s rule has been proposed to evaluate fpt densities of gauss - markov processes , that can be implemented to obtain reliable evaluations of firing densities for neuronal models based on gauss - markov processes .",
    "+ the methods proposed in the previous section rest on the strong markov assumption on the stochastic process modeling the neuron s membrane potential , which grants the possibility of making use of the mentioned analytic and computational methods for fpt pdf evaluations .",
    "this is not the case when the stochastic process used to model the neuron s firing mechanism is non - markov . here",
    "we shall focus our attention on gauss non - markov processes .",
    "however , thus doing we face the lack of effective analytical methods for obtaining manageable closed - form expressions for the fpt pdf , although some preliminary analytical results have been obtained by ricciardi and sato in @xcite for a class of stationary gaussian processes .",
    "indeed , if @xmath0 is one - dimensional non - singular stationary gaussian process mean square differentiable , a series expansion for the fpt pdf was derived ( see , @xcite ) . in the following , for convenience",
    ", we shall take @xmath50 as initial time and , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath51=0 $ ] and @xmath2=1 $ ] , with @xmath4 an arbitrarily specified initial state .",
    "furthermore , the covariance function @xmath52 : = \\gamma ( t-\\tau ) $ ] will be assumed to be such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( this last assumptions being equivalent to the mean square differentiable property ) .",
    "the fpt pdf of @xmath0 through @xmath1 is then given by the following expression @xmath55=w_1(t|x_0)+\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty ( -1)^i\\int_0^t \\!\\ ! dt_1 \\!\\ !",
    "\\int_{t_1}^t \\!\\ !",

    "] ) does not appear to be manageable for practical uses , even though it has recently been shown that it allows to obtain some interesting asymptotic results @xcite .",
    "since ( [ ( 0 ) ] ) is a leibnitz series for each fixed @xmath62 estimates of the fpt pdf can in principle be obtained since its partial sum of order @xmath63 provides a lower or an upper bound to @xmath64 depending on whether @xmath63 is even or odd .",
    "however , also the evaluation of such partial sums is extremely cumbersome .    in conclusion , at the present time for this class of gaussian processes , no effective analytical methods , nor viable numerical algorithms",
    "are available to evaluate the fpt pdf .",
    "a simulation procedure seems to be the only residual way of approach .    to this aim",
    ", we have restored and updated an algorithm due to franklin @xcite in order to construct sample paths of a stationary gaussian process with spectral density of a rational type and deterministic starting point .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "let us consider the linear filter @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the impulse response function and @xmath67 is the input signal . by fourier transformation , ( [ ( 3 ) ] ) yields @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the spectral densities of input @xmath67 and output @xmath0 , respectively , and where @xmath71 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath72 equation ( [ ( 4 ) ] ) is suggestive of a method to construct a gaussian process @xmath0 having a preassigned spectral density @xmath73 .",
    "it is indeed sufficient to consider a white noise @xmath74 having spectral density @xmath75 as the input signal and then select @xmath66 in such a way that @xmath76 . if the spectral density of @xmath0 is of rational type , namely if @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are polynomials with @xmath80 setting @xmath81 , from ( [ ( 4 ) ] ) it follows @xmath82 where @xmath83 to calculate the output signal @xmath0 it is thus necessary to solve first the differential equation @xmath84 to obtain the stationary solution @xmath85 , and then evaluate @xmath86 the simulation procedure is designed to construct sample paths of the process @xmath0 at the instants @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a positive constant time increment .",
    "the underlying idea can be applied to any gaussian process having spectral densities of a rational type and , since the sample paths of the simulated process are generated independently of one another , this simulation procedure is particularly suited for implementation on supercomputers .",
    "extensive computations have been performed on parallel computers to explore the different shapes of the fpt pdf as induced by the oscillatory behaviors of covariances and thresholds ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "the estimated fpt pdf @xmath93 with @xmath94 is shown in figure  2(b ) , with @xmath95 in figure  2(c ) and with @xmath96 in figure  2(d ) .",

    "+ the aim of this section is to compare the behavior of the fpt pdf s among gauss - markov processes and gaussian non - markov processes , in order to analyze how the lack of memory affects the shape of the density , also with reference to the specified type of correlation function . for simplicity ,",

    "when the correlation function is of type ( [ ( funcorr ) ] ) , @xmath0 is not mean square differentiable , since @xmath102 .",
    "thus the series expansion ( [ ( 0 ) ] ) does not hold . however , specific assumptions on the parameter @xmath103 help us characterize the shape of the fpt pdf .",

    "since in ( [ ( spectral ) ] ) the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator , it is possible to apply the simulation algorithm described in section 3 in order to estimate the fpt pdf @xmath93 of the process .",
