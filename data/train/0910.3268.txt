    "to date , all spin wave experiments in non - condensed systems have been on spin-@xmath1 or pseudo - spin-@xmath1 systems .",
    "here we ask the following questions : what is the nature of spin waves in a thermal spin-@xmath2 gas ?",
    "how do these differ from the well understood spin-@xmath1 case ?",
    "these questions are of experimental interest , with several groups possessing the technology to study them using ultra - cold gases @xcite .    in the context of cold gases ,",
    "spin waves were first discussed by bashkin @xcite , and independently by lhuillier and lalo @xcite .",
    "the key finding was that spin exchange collisions can give rise to weakly damped spin waves even in a non - degenerate gas .",
    "ultra cold gases have provided an exciting setting for observing these spin phenomena . in particular , experiments on pseudo spin-@xmath1",
    "bose and fermi systems by the jila @xcite and duke @xcite groups have observed coherent collective oscillations in an otherwise classical gas .",
    "one expects the physics of a spin-@xmath2 gas to be far richer than a pseudo - spin-@xmath1 system .",
    "this is amply demonstrated by experiments on condensed spin-@xmath2 gases @xcite .",
    "one of the most dramatic observations was that of a dynamical instability in bose condensed @xmath0rb , studied by sadler _ et al .",
    "beginning with a gas pumped into the @xmath3 state , they observed the spontaneous formation of transverse ferromagnetic domains .",
    "will a similar instability be observed in the normal state ?",
    "we find that there is an exponentially growing mode in the unmagnetized gas , even in the normal state , with a wavelength comparable to typical cloud sizes .    from a theoretical perspective , the source of novel physics in a dilute spin-@xmath2 bose gas ( such as @xmath0rb , @xmath4na ) is the structure of the interactions , described by _ two _ coupling constants : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , representing spin - independent and spin - dependent contact interactions .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian density takes the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the local density and spin density respectively @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath6 has no corresponding analog in the spin-@xmath1 case .",
    "this interaction gives rise to spin mixing collisions , where two atoms in the @xmath3 hyperfine sub - level can combine to form atoms in the @xmath10 states @xcite .",
    "another important consideration is the quadratic zeeman effect , which arises from the hyperfine interaction and the difference in the coupling between the electronic and nuclear spins .",
    "the linear zeeman effect can be neglected in the hamiltonian as the total spin of the atoms is a conserved quantity .",
    "we begin our analysis by setting up the problem , and reviewing spin waves in a spin-@xmath1 gas .",
    "this allows us to highlight the differences with the spin-@xmath2 case .",
    "next , we turn to the spin-@xmath2 gas .",
    "starting from a microscopic hamiltonian , we obtain a linearized boltzmann equation about the ferromagnetic ( @xmath11 ) and polar ( @xmath3 ) states , and calculate the spin wave dispersion in each case .",
    "we find that a polar gas with ferromagnetic interactions is dynamically unstable towards spin - mixing collisions for small enough zeeman fields , analogous to the condensed case . by explicit calculation of the dispersion relation ,",
    "we show that for strong enough anti - ferromagnetic interactions , an instability occurs in the polar state @xcite .",
    "following these analytic calculations , we perform numerical simulations of a trapped gas using an effective @xmath2d boltzmann equation .",
    "we explore the evolution of transversely polarized spins , and investigate dynamical instabilities .",
    "our work complements prior work on the kinetics of a normal spin-@xmath2 bose gas by endo and nikuni @xcite .",
    "while their focus is on the effect of collisions in the damping of collective modes of a trapped gas , with particular emphasis on dipole modes , we focus here on the collisionless , knudsen regime .",
    "as described by ho @xcite and ohmi and machida @xcite , the second - quantized hamiltonian for a spin-@xmath2 gas , expressed in a frame where each spin component is rotating at its larmor frequency is    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , is the quantum number for the z - component of the spin , @xmath14 is the field annihilation operator obeying bosonic commutation relations , and @xmath15 is the trapping potential . here @xmath16 denotes the dimensionless vector spin operator . throughout ,",
    "we set @xmath17 .",
    "boldface is used to denote matrices , and arrows denote vectors .",
    "the interaction strengths , expressed in terms of the scattering lengths in the spin-@xmath18 and @xmath19 channel ( @xmath20 ) are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a negative @xmath6 favors a ferromagnetic state with @xmath23 , while for positive @xmath6 , the equilibrium state is one with @xmath24 , where all the atoms are in the @xmath3 state , or simply an incoherent mixture .",
    "additionally , one considers the quadratic zeeman effect @xmath25 , which favors a state with @xmath3 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus for a gas with negative @xmath6 such as @xmath0rb , the spin dependent contact interaction competes with the quadratic zeeman field , giving rise to interesting dynamics @xcite .    in the condensed gas , dipolar interactions may also be important @xcite . at the lower densities found in a normal gas these interactions , which fall as @xmath27 ,",
    "may be neglected .",
    "following standard arguments @xcite we obtain the equations of motion for the wigner density matrix @xmath28 , whose elements are @xmath29",
    ". the diagonal components of the spin density matrix , when integrated in momentum , give the densities of each of the spin species .",
    "the off diagonal terms , often referred to as _ coherences _ , are responsible for spin dynamics . here",
    "@xmath30 represents momentum , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the center of mass and relative coordinates .",
    "the wigner function is the quantum analog of the classical distribution function . by taking moments of the wigner function",
    ", we obtain physical observables such as the density @xmath33 and spin current @xmath34 .",
    "the equation of motion takes the standard form @xcite : @xmath35 + \\frac{1}{2}\\big\\{\\vec{\\nabla}_{r}\\textbf{v},\\vec{\\nabla}_{p}\\textbf{f}\\big\\ } + \\textbf{i}_{c}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the collision integral and @xmath37 is the interaction potential .",
    "this form of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is completely general , and holds for any non - condensed spinor gas .",
    "the role of spin enters in determining the dimension of the density matrix , and the exact form of the interaction potential @xmath38 .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) arise from forward and backward scattering collisions .",
    "while the former type merely alter the mean field seen by the atoms , backward scattering collisions allow the colliding atoms to exchange momentum .",
    "the last term in the boltzmann equation is the collision integral , responsible for energy relaxation . while a detailed derivation of the collision integral is non trivial @xcite , the qualitative properties are well described within a simple relaxation time approximation @xmath39 .",
    "the relaxation time ( @xmath40 ) is proportional to the elastic scattering rate @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the thermal velocity and @xmath8 is the density .",
    "the precise expression for @xmath43 determined by including the interactions within the hartree - fock description is@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the identity matrix , tr denotes the trace operation , and @xmath46 is the magnetization .",
    "our form for the interaction energy is equivalent to that of endo and nikuni @xcite .",
    "one may explicitly check that this interaction potential is rotationally invariant in spin space .    in experiments",
    "the external trapping potential @xmath47 is often spin - dependent , an effect which is readily incorporated .",
    "the spin independent interaction gives rise to self and cross interaction terms .",
    "the latter give rise to coherences and are encoded in the second term in ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the mean - field potential alters the trapping potential seen by all the atoms by an amount @xmath48 , where the total density @xmath49 .",
    "the contribution of the spin - dependent interaction is more subtle and can be understood as follows : the first term accounts for spin dynamics such as spin - relaxation collisions . for ferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath50 ) ,",
    "the last term increases the density of regions where the atomic spins are aligned with respect to one another ( @xmath51 ) . for a fully polarized gas in the @xmath52 sublevel , this is @xmath53 , while for an unmagnetized ( @xmath3 ) gas it is zero .",
    "finally , we note that while the self- and cross- interactions between the three sublevels produce diagonal and off - diagonal contributions to the interaction potential , the spin - relaxation or population exchange interactions only gives rise to coherences , and are absent for a single component gas .      here",
    "we elaborate on our argument for why one expects richer spin physics in a spin-@xmath2 system versus a spin-@xmath1 one .",
    "we assume a uniform , collisionless gas with @xmath54 , such that all the physics is governed by the commutator in ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the pseudo - spin @xmath1 case may be understood starting from the fact that that a @xmath55 matrix ( @xmath56 ) can be decomposed into @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the pauli matrices . expressing the density matrix and interaction potential in this way ,",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the completely antisymmetric unit tensor .",
    "the second equation , which is responsible for much of the spin wave physics in a spin-@xmath1 system simply says that the interactions act as an effective magnetic field about which the spins precess .    to analyze the spin-@xmath2 case , we follow ohmi and machida @xcite and use a cartesian basis ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this representation is related to the spherical ( @xmath64 ) basis as follows @xcite : @xmath65,@xmath66 and @xmath67 .    in the cartesian basis",
    "the irreducible decomposition of a spin-@xmath2 system is @xmath68 , where the scalar @xmath69 , @xmath70 is a completely antisymmetric matrix proportional to the vector spin @xmath71 order , and @xmath72 is a symmetric traceless tensor which is related to the spin fluctuations @xmath73 , and is a nematic degree of freedom .",
    "writing the density matrix ( @xmath74 ) and interaction ( @xmath38 ) in terms of their respective irreducible decompositions we obtain three equations of motion : @xmath60 , @xmath75 + i[\\textbf{v}^{(s ) } , \\textbf{f}^{(s)}]$ ] , and @xmath76 + i[\\textbf{v}^{(s ) } , \\textbf{f}^{(a)}]$ ] . here",
    "the second equation describes the evolution of @xmath77 and the spin currents , while the last equation describes dynamics of the nematicity ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the new feature is that the spin and nematic degrees of freedom are coupled by the interaction matrix . using the levi - civita identities , it is easy to see that @xmath78 $ ] is the spin-@xmath2 analog of the corresponding spin-@xmath1 term which acts as an effective magnetic field for the spins .",
    "but the last term @xmath79 $ ] shows that fluctuations of the nematicity can change the spin dynamics .      as a starting point for understanding the spin-@xmath2 gas , we review the spin-@xmath1 case . as explained in @xcite , spin dynamics in the cold collision regime are governed by momentum exchange collisions with a characteristic timescale @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the two - body scattering length . when @xmath82 , or alternatively , the thermal debroglie wavelength is large compared to the scattering length @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and for times shorter than @xmath85 , particles exchange momentum several times without significantly altering the energy distribution",
    ". therefore excitations with wavelength longer than @xmath86 are a collective effect .    for typical densities ( @xmath87@xmath88 ) and scattering lengths , @xmath89 the condensation temperature ( @xmath90 ) for the interacting system may be approximated to that of an ideal bose gas @xcite .",
    "thus in order to see collective spin phenomena , we require @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the average trap frequency @xcite . although this is typically a wide temperature range @xmath93k , diffusive relaxation damps out spin waves at higher temperatures .",
    "a two - component gas has a longitudinal and a transverse spin mode .",
    "the longitudinal mode has a linear dispersion , but is strongly landau damped @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the transverse mode is weakly damped and propagates with dispersion @xmath94 , where @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "these weakly damped spin waves have been observed in the context of spin polarized hydrogen by johnson _",
