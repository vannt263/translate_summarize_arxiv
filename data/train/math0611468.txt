    "one degree of freedom corresponds to fast variables , and the other corresponds to slow variables .",
    "the ratio of the time derivatives of slow and fast variables is of order @xmath0 . to describe the dynamics in such systems",
    "one can use the adiabatic approximation constructed as follows .    consider the fast system , i.e. the system for the fast variables at frozen values of the slow variables .",

    "hamiltonian system involving the slow variables as parameters .",
    "assume that for a range of values of the slow variables there is a region filled with closed trajectories on the phase portrait of the fast system .",
    "then one can introduce `` action - angle '' variables in the fast system @xcite .",
    "the `` action '' variable of the fast system is an adiabatic invariant ( i.e. an approximate first integral ) of the complete system : its value oscillates with amplitude @xmath3 on time periods of order @xmath4 along a phase trajectory . to describe approximately the variation of the slow variables",
    ", one should average the rates of their variation over the `` angle '' variable of the fast motion .",
    "this approximation of the real motion is called the adiabatic approximation @xcite . the obtained 1 d.o.f .",
    "hamiltonian system for the slow variables , involving the `` action '' variable of fast motion as a parameter , is called the slow system .",
    "assume that for some range of values of the slow variables the `` action '' variable phase trajectories of the slow system are closed .",
    "then in this range the motion can be described with v.i.arnolds theorem on perpetual adiabatic invariance @xcite : the `` action '' value along a trajectory perpetually undergoes only small , of order @xmath2 , oscillations ( under a certain generality condition ) .",
    "the considered region of the phase space is filled , up to a small residual set , with invariant tori , which are @xmath5-close to the invariant tori of the system of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we shall consider cases in which there are separatrices on the fast system s phase portrait ( see figure [ fastplane ] ) , and there is a region in the phase space ( the domain of separatrix crossings ) where the projections of phase points onto the plane of the fast variables repeatedly cross the separatrix in the process of evolution of the slow variables . in this case",
    "the above described construction of the adiabatic approximation needs some modification , and the above formulated assertions on the adiabatic approximation accuracy are not applicable .",
    "we shall assume that a certain symmetry condition is valid : the areas inside the separatrix loops in figure [ fastplane ] are equal .",
    "the main result of the present paper is as follows . under certain generality conditions in the domain of separatrix crossings on every energy level there",
    "exist many , of order @xmath1 , stable periodic trajectories of period @xmath4 .",
    "each of these trajectories is surrounded by a stability island , and the measure of this island is estimated from below by a value of order @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the total measure of the stability islands is estimated from below by a quantity which is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "a stability island is a domain on an energy level bounded by a two - dimensional invariant torus .",
    "a stability island contains a discrete family of invariant tori contractible to the periodic trajectory .",
    "introduce a `` modified action '' equal to the `` action '' for points inside the separatrix loops in figure [ fastplane ] , and equal to one half of the `` action '' for the other points .",
    "this `` modified action '' is a perpetual adiabatic invariant of the motion inside a stability island : its value along a phase trajectory perpetually undergoes only oscillations with amplitude of order @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the stability islands are also islands of perpetual adiabatic invariance .",
    "we note that the existence of stability islands with total measure that is not small with @xmath2 in the domain of separatrix crossings is quite unexpected .",
    "visually , in many problems , this domain looks like a region of dynamical chaos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a single stability island can not have a measure larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of stability islands with total measure not small with @xmath2 in the domain of separatrix crossings was established in @xcite in the case of a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom and the hamiltonian function slowly periodically depending on time . here",
    "we generalize this result to 2 d.o.f .",
    "systems . like in @xcite , the proofs are based on the study of asymptotic formulas for the corresponding poincar map . in @xcite",
    "these formulas were constructed with the use of asymptotic expressions for the jump of the adiabatic invariant at a separatrix crossing in systems with one and a half d.o.f .",
    "@xcite and for the variation of the `` angle '' variable between separatrix crossings in such systems @xcite .",
    "below we use analogous formulas for systems with two d.o.f .",
    "@xcite . to find linearly stable periodic trajectories we look for linearly stable fixed points of the poincar map .",
    "the results on lyapunov stability of the periodic trajectories ( the fixed points ) and on the existence of invariant tori surrounding the periodic trajectories ( invariant curves around the fixed points ) are provided by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory .",
    "an example of application of the present theory to the motion of a charged particle in the parabolic model of magnetic field in the earth magnetotail is given in @xcite .",
    "consider a two degrees of freedom hamiltonian system with hamiltonian @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are coordinates , and @xmath8 are canonically conjugated momenta , @xmath9 is a small parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are :    p = - , q = , = - , = . [ 2.0 ] the variables @xmath11 are called fast variables , while @xmath12 are called slow variables .",
    "the hamiltonian system for @xmath11 at @xmath13 is called fast ( or unperturbed ) system .",
    "assume that at all considered values of the slow variables the phase portrait of the fast system looks as in figure [ fastplane ] .",
    "on this phase portrait , there exist a non - degenerate saddle point @xmath14 and separatrices @xmath15 .",
    "these separatrices divide the @xmath16-plane into domains @xmath17 .",
    "denote the value of @xmath18 at the saddle point as @xmath19 , and introduce @xmath20 . on the separatrices @xmath21 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath22 in @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "the `` action '' variable @xmath37 in the unperturbed system involves @xmath12 as parameters : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the area on the phase portrait of the fast system surrounded by a phase trajectory passing through the point @xmath16 . for all @xmath11 on the hamiltonian level line @xmath40 in the domain @xmath36",

    ". if @xmath54 is sufficiently large , the relations ( [ 6.8 ] ) are also valid on @xmath55 .",

    "validity of the other relations ( [ 6.4])-([6.10 ] ) follows from the definition of @xmath55 and equations ( [ 6.12 ] ) , ( [ 6.13 ] ) .",
    "system ( [ 6.11])-([6.13 ] ) can be interpreted geometrically as follows .",

    "as @xmath63 varies , the curve @xmath64 is moving slowly on the torus .",
    "at the same time , the point @xmath65 is moving fast , with its velocity vector @xmath66 varying slowly .",
    "solutions of system ( [ 6.11])-([6.13 ] ) correspond to values of `` time '' @xmath63 when point @xmath67 crosses the curve @xmath64 .",
    "it follows from assumption * h1 * , that there exists @xmath68 such that the ratio @xmath69 is irrational . then in the interval @xmath70 on every segment of length @xmath71 of `` time '' @xmath63 the point @xmath72 crosses transversely the moving curve @xmath64 at least once .",
    "indeed , the point s trajectory is close to a dense winding of the torus with irrational angular coefficient @xmath69 , and the curve @xmath73 is transversal to the vector @xmath74 at least at one point .",
    "[ the latter is because @xmath73 is not straight . ]    therefore , there exist more than @xmath75 intersection points .",
    "each intersection point corresponds to a linearly stable stationary point of the return map . in section [ distrib ]",
    "we obtain an asymptotic expression for the number of intersection points .",
    "let @xmath76 be one of the solutions of system ( [ 6.11])-([6.13 ] ) , found in the previous section .",
    "one can rewrite the map @xmath77 in variables @xmath78 , expand its right hand sides in @xmath2 supposing @xmath79 , and neglect terms @xmath80 .",
    "thus , one obtains a map that does not contain @xmath2 and depends on the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "this map has a stationary linearly stable point @xmath82 . according to kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory , under certain conditions [ absence of resonances up to the 4-th order , non - zero coefficient in the normal form ] the stationary point of the complete map",
    "is surrounded with a cantor family of invariant curves ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these latter conditions of kam theory in the case under consideration can be written as one condition , namely @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a continuous function .",
