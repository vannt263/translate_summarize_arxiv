    "one main objective of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to discover the precise mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "a well motivated hypothesis is that there exists a higgs boson which is not a fundamental scalar .",
    "instead it could be a composite state of a strongly coupled theory , the pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry  @xcite .",
    "compositeness can explain the insensitivity of ewsb to ultraviolet physics , while the pseudo - goldstone nature of the higgs boson may explain the little hierarchy between the scale of new physics and the scale of ewsb .",
    "this mechanism has recently received increased attention , due to the realization that calculable composite higgs models can be constructed in five dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is an old one  @xcite , but only recently realistic models in warped extra dimensions  @xcite have been constructed .",
    "the experience with five - dimensional models indicates that custodial symmetry  @xcite and a custodial protection of the @xmath5 coupling  @xcite are likely ingredients of realistic constructions .",
    "little higgs models  @xcite also use the idea of a higgs boson which is the pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry . in order to solve the little hierarchy problem",
    ", they employ the mechanism of collective symmetry breaking , which ensures that the higgs mass remains insensitive to ultraviolet physics at one loop .",
    "the main phenomenological implications of a higgs boson which is the pseudo - goldstone boson of an extended broken symmetry are largely independent of the particular details of how the global symmetry is broken .",
    "they can therefore be conveniently described using an effective lagrangian approach  @xcite .",
    "a reasonable starting point is a symmetry breaking pattern that includes custodial symmetry .",
    "a minimal example of such a pattern is given by a global @xmath6 symmetry broken at a scale @xmath7 to its custodially symmetric subgroup @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "using this effective lagrangian approach , it was argued in  @xcite that composite higgs models with an @xmath0 symmetry breaking pattern are difficult to make compatible with electroweak and flavor precision data without introducing a substantial fine - tuning .",
    "the argument was based on very minimal models , in which fermionic resonances did not span full representations of the @xmath6 group .",
    "in addition , the estimation of electroweak observables was made neglecting contributions which are formally subleading , but can be relevant in specific situations .",
    "two recent works extended the analysis of  @xcite to models in which the fermionic composites span full representations of @xmath6  @xcite . although these analyses differ in several aspects , like the degree of explicit @xmath6 symmetry breaking and the symmetry breaking patterns , their outcome is somewhat similar .",
    "only a small region of parameter space is allowed by electroweak precision data in models with no significant fine - tuning and one set of fermionic composites spanning a vector representation of @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate thoroughly the viability of models with an @xmath0 symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "our analysis extends previous works in two ways , by making a careful computation of the effect of the new fermionic states on electroweak observables and by considering the effect of an extended fermionic sector .    in our study of electroweak precision constraints we use an exact one - loop calculation of the relevant electroweak observables .",
    "we do this in complete generality , and our analytic formulae can be used in other models . in particular , our result for the anomalous @xmath9 coupling is , to the best of our knowledge , the first complete calculation for an arbitrary number of new quarks with generic couplings .",
    "we find that such an exact computation can be important when formally subleading effects in commonly employed approximations are enhanced .",
    "we also examine the possibility of multiple sets of fermionic composites , departing from minimal constructions .",
    "our motivation is the model presented in  @xcite , in which a five - dimensional realization of a composite higgs model with @xmath0 symmetry breaking pattern was shown to be fully compatible with electroweak precision tests , flavor observables , electroweak symmetry breaking and the observed dark matter relic abundance .",
    "the non - minimal fermion sector of the model in  @xcite was indispensable in order to render its predictions compatible with experimental data .",
    "the goal of our article is to present an effective four - dimensional description of composite higgs models with a non - minimal fermionic content and discuss their electroweak and flavor constraints .",
    "we show that there are large regions of parameter space in which composite higgs models can provide a fully realistic description of ewsb without fine tuning .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ effective ] we briefly review the effective description of composite higgs models with an @xmath0 symmetry breaking pattern , including the experimental constraints of minimal models .",
    "section  [ fermions ] is devoted to a description of the relevant fermionic sector of the theory and its effects on electroweak precision observables and flavor physics . in section  [ phenomenology ]",
    "we present exact one - loop expressions for electroweak and flavor precision observables which are valid in general extensions of the sm .",
    "the main phenomenological implications of our model are discussed in section  [ ewpt ] , where we describe two options for realistic composite higgs models , a very simple one and a slightly more involved one which is closer to the realistic examples we know from extra dimensions .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the low energy effective description of a composite higgs model with @xmath0 symmetry breaking pattern can be described by a scalar @xmath10 in the fundamental representation of @xmath6 , subject to the constraint @xmath11 where @xmath7 is the scale of the global symmetry breaking , assumed to be somewhat larger than the ewsb scale @xmath12 gev .",
    "the first four components of @xmath10 , which transform as the fundamental representation of so(4 ) , are denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 subgroup of @xmath15 , where the hypercharge corresponds to the @xmath16 generator , is weakly gauged .",
    "group is required to generate the correct weinberg angle , but it is irrelevant for the present discussion and will be disregarded . ] the vacuum expectation value of @xmath13 breaks the ew symmetry , @xmath17 from eq .",
    "( [ f : definition ] ) we see that the ratio @xmath18 measures the higgs compositeness , _",
    "i.e. _ how the vev of @xmath10 is split between @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "canonical normalization of the different components in @xmath10 , expanded around its vev , requires a rescaling of the physical higgs @xmath20 whereas the would be goldstone bosons are not modified .",
    "this redefinition implies an important feature of higgs compositeness , namely that higgs couplings to gauge bosons are suppressed with respect to the couplings in the sm by the factor @xmath21 . in the case of fermions ,",
    "the suppression factor depends also on the embedding of the sm fermions in @xmath6 representations  @xcite .",
    "this suppression of the higgs couplings affects the quantum corrections to electroweak precision observables , leading to some sensitivity to the ultraviolet cut - off  @xcite .",
    "the leading effect can be taken into account by replacing the higgs mass with an effective ( heavier ) higgs in the sm expressions of the one - loop corrections to the electroweak precision observables , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ultraviolet cut - off of our effective theory , @xmath24 being the number of goldstone bosons .",
    "this modification gives rise to an additional contribution to the peskin - takeuchi  @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath1 parameters @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reference higgs mass used in the electroweak fit and @xmath28 is the cosine of the weinberg angle .    furthermore , custodial symmetry can naturally account for a suppressed contribution of ultraviolet physics to the @xmath1 parameter , but there is no reason not to expect a contribution to the @xmath25 parameter from higher dimensional operators . a reasonable estimate , assuming that new physics couples linearly to the sm ( otherwise this estimate should have an extra loop suppression ) , is @xmath29    the combination of the two corrections , ( [ st : higgs ] ) and ( [ s : lambda ] ) , results in a positive shift to the @xmath25 parameter and a negative shift to the @xmath1 parameter .",

    "as emphasized in  @xcite , this is a quite generic implication of higgs compositeness and custodial symmetry , that seems to disfavor composite higgs models as a realistic description of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , we have not included yet in our discussion the effect of other composite states that might be lighter than the cut - off of our effective description . in the next section",

    "-*importance of single heavy quark production*. single production , which tests directly the couplings of the new quarks to the top and bottom , becomes an important tool , complementary to pair production and to indirect tests through electroweak precision observables , to fully reconstruct the fermionic sector of the model .",
    "-*strongly composite @xmath60*. a strongly composite @xmath60 ( as opposed to a strongly composite @xmath106 as in the case of one multiplet ) is now a quite common occurrence .",
    "this is a welcome feature , as there are some uv completions for which extra sources of flavor violation can be enhanced for a strongly composite @xmath106 .",

    "one interesting possibility is the presence of a rather light ( @xmath226 gev ) full , almost degenerate , @xmath225 of @xmath8 as the only set of particles below 1 tev .",
    "this set of new quarks does not contribute significantly to the @xmath1 parameter or @xmath34 ( as it barely breaks the custodial symmetry ) , a role that is mainly played by heavier modes which are more difficult to produce at the lhc .",
    "the light quarks ( two charge @xmath58 , one @xmath118 and one @xmath155 ) all decay mainly to the top and therefore a large number of @xmath227 events should be produced at the lhc ( refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the charge @xmath118 quarks should be easily discovered with very early data at the lhc ) . once their masses are known and some information on their couplings from single production is gathered , a reanalysis of electroweak precision data should give a clear picture of the fermionic content of the model .",
    "the possibility we have just mentioned , a light full @xmath225 representation of @xmath8 , would clearly point to the underlying symmetry structure of the theory .",
    "there are however other regions of parameter space in which this structure is not so obvious .",
    "one example is the case in which the only light mode , easily accessible at the lhc , is a charge @xmath58 quark . of course",
    ", we know that in the context of composite higgs models with little fine - tuning , a single charge @xmath58 singlet is not compatible with electroweak data . however , without additional information , it will not be easy to disentangle the contribution of higgs compositeness and the new quark to electroweak precision data .",
    "our study of electroweak constraints shows however that the heavier modes must significantly contribute to the @xmath1-parameter and @xmath34 and therefore should have large couplings to the top and/or bottom that would make them accessible through single production .",
    "a variety of viable spectra allows for the possibiliy in which we have several non - degenerate modes below 1 tev .",
    "for instance , there are regions in which the lightest new quark is a charge @xmath118 one , then a heavier charge @xmath58 and then a heavier ( but still relatively light , @xmath228 gev ) charge @xmath155 .",
    "the mass difference is commonly large enough to allow for cascade decays that end in the top and up to three gauge bosons .",
    "this means we can easily have up to eight gauge bosons and two b s in the final state , @xmath229 a fraction of the time @xmath230 will decay into @xmath231 so that the final state can also be @xmath232 or @xmath233 .",
    "thus , we have processes with a relatively large production cross section ( for quarks which are not too heavy ) and a very complex final state with many jets , leptons and missing energy .",
    "although a detailed analysis is required to assess our capability of understanding these complex processes , it is likely that they will be easy to discover but very difficult to fully reconstruct and the detailed information on the quark masses may not be extracted .",
    "we note that the same features as we find here , a rich spectrum of light modes , some of which do not contribute very strongly to electroweak observables , and a number of heavier modes ( but still lighter than the bosonic resonances ) which contribute to render electroweak observables compatible with experimental data has been recently observed in composite higgs models in five dimensions .",
    "in fact , this kind of spectrum proved crucial to make the model in  @xcite _ simultaneously _ compatible with electroweak precision tests and with a realistic pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the realization of electroweak symmetry breaking is a long - standing mystery that will be soon tested in detail at the lhc .",
    "composite higgs models , in which the higgs boson arises as the ( composite ) pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry in a strongly coupled gauge theory , is an appealing candidate .",
    "it naturally protects the electroweak scale from short distance physics and can even explain the suppression of the electroweak scale with respect to the scale of new physics .",
    "compatibility with current experimental data seem to point to a relatively large scale of new bosonic resonances @xmath234  tev and to a custodially preserving symmetry breaking pattern to protect the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "similarly , a left - right symmetry within the custodial symmetry naturally protects the @xmath9 coupling from large corrections . a minimal symmetry breaking pattern that contains the higgs as a pseudo - goldstone boson , is custodially symmetric and can protect the @xmath9 coupling is a global @xmath6 symmetry spontaneously broken to @xmath8 and fermions in the fundamental representation of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the low energy implications of this set - up can be simply analyzed with the aid of an effective description based on an @xmath0 non - linear sigma model . if the higgs is quite composite , _",
    "i.e. _ if the scale of the global symmetry breaking is not far from the electroweak scale , as one would expect in a natural ( non fine - tuned ) model , its couplings to the standard model fields are significantly reduced .",
    "this results in a sensitivity to the cut - off of the theory whose effect can be taken into account by defining an effective ( heavier ) higgs mass .",
    "this effective higgs mass is the one that should be included in the calculation of electroweak precision observables , giving a positive contribution to the @xmath25 parameter and a negative contribution to the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "these contributions simply come from the fact that the higgs is composite and are therefore quite generic . uv physics , being custodially symmetric , is not expected to contribute to the @xmath1 parameter but it can give a tree level contribution to the @xmath25 parameter that , together with the contributions to @xmath25 and @xmath1 from higgs compositeness , put the model in gross contradiction with current experimental tests .",
    "the large mass of the top quark , however , makes it natural to assume that it is partially composite . in that case",
    "it will strongly couple to the fermionic resonances of the strongly coupled theory which , if lighter than the cut - off of the theory , can have an important impact on electroweak observables ( due to their mixing with the top , which breaks explicitly the custodial symmetry ) .",

    "the @xmath6 symmetry is explicitly broken by the sm quarks , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( the former also breaks the custodial @xmath8 symmetry ) , which couple linearly to the strongly coupled theory .",
    "this coupling makes @xmath59 and @xmath60 partly composite and , through their composite components , couple to the higgs and get a mass .",
    "we have computed the exact contribution of this new sector to the relevant electroweak precision observables , @xmath1 and @xmath34 , and also to some of the flavor observables that are strongly correlated to this new fermionic sector , @xmath157 mixing and @xmath3 .",
    "we have performed an exact one - loop calculation which does not rely on any approximation and presented the results in a general enough way that can be easily extended to models beyond the one we have considered .",
    "our exact calculation , that goes beyond the large yukawa approximation which is commonly used to estimate the contribution to the anomalous @xmath9 coupling , can have an important impact if the model is strongly constrained , as happens in our case in some regions of parameter space , or if one wants to do precision analysis of new physics , as it will become necessary if new quarks are discovered at the lhc .",
    "armed with these detailed calculations of the most relevant electroweak observables , we have used adaptive monte - carlo methods to scan the parameter space in search of the regions allowed by experimental data .",
    "the result depends dramatically on whether there exist just one or more fermionic multiplets below the cut - off of our theory .",
    "the case of only one multiplet below @xmath186 is quite constrained . when all the experimental constraints are taken into account , only a small region with a very composite lh top survives . in this region the spectrum of new quarks and their couplings",
    "are almost univocally determined by electroweak and flavor precision data . above the top , there are typically two quite light ( @xmath235 gev ) quarks of charge @xmath118 and @xmath58 , respectively ( the former typically slightly lighter ) followed by another charge @xmath58 quark with mass @xmath236 gev @xmath237 tev .",
    "the lighter two quarks should be easily produced at the lhc and have large enough couplings to the top to make single production an interesting channel to study .",
    "furthermore , they typically induce large enough corrections to the @xmath238 coupling to be detectable at the lhc . the strong constraints on this possibility and the fact that we have simply assumed a realistic pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking - which is fully calculable and therefore imposes further constraints in a uv completion of the model - have motivated us to consider the possibility that more than one set of fermionic resonances contribute to electroweak observables .",
    "this motivation is reinforced by the experience with 5d uv completions of the model , in which electroweak symmetry breaking imposes non - trivial constraints on the low energy spectrum , usually requiring a more complex spectrum of light fermionic resonances than the one we have found in the case of one multiplet .",
    "the situation dramatically changes when two fermionic multiplets are allowed to contribute to electroweak precision observables .",
    "the spectrum of light resonances is no longer constrained ; we have found from one single quark of charge @xmath58 to four quarks in a full degenerate multiplet @xmath225 of @xmath8 below 1 tev .",
    "their couplings to the top can also vastly change , which makes the study of single production even more interesting . when pair - produced , these new quarks can produce long decay chains that contain a large number ( up to eight ) of sm electroweak vector bosons and a @xmath239 pair .",
    "thus , final states with many jets , leptons and missing energy would be a common signature in these models .",
    "we conclude that composite higgs models with no bosonic resonances ( apart from the higgs itself ) below the cut - off of the low energy effective theory can be fully compatible with current experimental constraints provided a quite rich spectrum of light fermionic resonances is present in the model .",
    "these new fermionic resonances should be easily produced at the lhc and would most likely be the first signal of new physics beyond the sm . establishing the symmetry pattern from the fermionic spectrum can however prove more difficult and will require a detailed analysis of the full experimental information , including pair production , single production and a detailed analysis of electroweak and flavor observables .",
    "this is really important as other signatures that would definitely pin down the model as a composite higgs model , like the measurement of the higgs couplings , longitudinal gauge boson scattering  @xcite and the production of new bosonic resonances of the strongly coupled theory can take much longer at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank j.a .",
