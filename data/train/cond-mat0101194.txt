    "recently , antiferromagnetically coupled mixed - spin chains with an alternating array of two kinds of spins have attracted interest among researchers @xcite .",
    "integrable models of mixed - spin antiferromagnetic chains were constructed by de  vega and woynarovich @xcite and the simplest case of such chains with spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 were subsequently studied @xcite .",
    "since these integrable models are exactly solvable , they are very useful for studying ( quantum ) statistical mechanical properties . although ferrimagnetic spin chains exhibit both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features , they show some peculiar , and sometimes surprising , features uncharacteristic of either the ferromagnet or the antiferromagnet ",
    "an example being the existence of gapless excitations with very small correlation length .",
    "it is important to understand these features more clearly . in this paper",
    "we first present a numerical study on the quantum ferrimagnetic spin chain in magnetic field by an exact diagonalization of a finite size system .",
    "we show that the low- and the high - field phases correspond respectively to the classical nel and the fully polarized ferromagnetic states where in the intermediate magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) , it is an xxz+h model with easy plane anisotropy @xcite , and the critical exponents are derived numerically .",
    "then the physical properties of the quantum ferrimagnets in the presence of the uniform magnetic field , as described by a phenomenological field theory based on a continuum non - linear @xmath0 model ( nl@xmath0 m ) formulation are examined further and will explore its novel features .",
    "when @xmath5 , the quantum ferrimagnets can be described by an easy - plane anisotropy state where the broken @xmath6 symmetry of spins corresponds to a topological spiral ( superfluid ) state .",
    "a metastable state with a non - zero topological spin - supercurrent @xmath7 , is the superfluid state of the order parameter in xy - plane",
    ". such possibility , may be led to the remarkable spin - dependent transport phenomenon in the ferrimagnetic chains , i.e. , the spin - supercurrent is carried collectively ( rather than by quasiparticles ) . because the spin current is non - zero when the system is in equilibrium , it flows without dissipation .",
    "the spiral state can be characterized by a wave - vector @xmath8 , i.e. , the soliton ( saw tooth ) lattice spacing @xmath9 is a length scale through which the in - plane phase @xmath10 of the order parameter changes by @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the spin - supercurrent is characterized by these wave - vectors , e.g. , @xmath12 . in analogy with the dissipation mechanism of the supercurrent in a one - dimensional superconductors",
    "@xcite , at large @xmath7 , hard - axis fluctuations of the order parameter becomes unstable and a first order phase transition to a uniform in - plane state ( @xmath13 ) takes place , and the long range order of the soliton lattice destroys . by overcoming the nucleation energy barrier of the order parameter vortices , a first order phase transition from easy plane spiral state to a saturated ferromagnetic state occurs at @xmath2 , depends on @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this transition turns out to a continuous cross - over if the initial state of the system at @xmath14 holds the zero spin - supercurrent ( a uniform easy plane with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the possibility of the existance of the superfluid phase and crossing onto a saturated ferromagnetic state ( the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath8 , and @xmath7 ) are discussed in some detail .",
    "the zero - temperature quantum ferrimagnetic chain is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the low energy physics of the quantum ferrimagnets in the presence of the external magnetic field can be obtained by a 1-dimensional nl@xmath0 m . the external magnetic field couples with @xmath19 , the nel order parameter @xmath20 where @xmath21 ^ 2\\right ) .",

    "it is this term that results in the ferromagnetic branch of the spin waves and corresponds to the trajectory of spin over a closed orbit on the unit sphere in the presence of a unit magnetic monopole at the center .",
    "the contribution of the first term in @xmath26 is equivalent to the area enclosed by this trajectory and since either of the smaller or the larger enclosed areas on the unit sphere must lead to the same berry s phase , the magnetic moment per unit cell , i.e. @xmath27 , must be quantized with integral values @xcite . setting @xmath28 in action ( [ lag_h ] )",
    "follows to the usual @xmath29 nl@xmath0 m in the magnetic field @xcite , applicable to the heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "similar to zero magnetic field @xcite we can find the spin - wave modes . at @xmath30 the ferrimagnetic spin - waves consist of both gapless ( ferromagnetic ) and gapped ( antiferromagnetic ) modes , and at @xmath31 the low ( high ) energy physics of quantum ferrimagnets is effectively like that of a ferromagnet ( antiferromagnet ) which is formed by the chain of ( dimerized ) unit cells with magnetic moment @xmath32 . applying an external magnetic field , @xmath33 ,",

    ", the effect of the external magnetic field is to suppress the antiferromagnetic gap",
    ". clearly , this reveals similarities between the ferrimagnets and the integer spin heisenberg antiferromagnets in magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the ferrimagnet corresponds to the _ staggered _ configuration of spins , unless @xmath34 . at this point",
    "the staggered state becomes unstable against the non - collinear _ spin - flop _ phase ( the partially polarized state ) of the spins when the spectrum becomes soft at @xmath35 .",
    "when the external magnetic field exceeds @xmath16 , the system will be in a saturated ferromagnetic phase , with a quantized magnetization per unit cell .",

    "it is the lower - bound of the external magnetic field , in the sense that the spin waves of the fully polarized state become soft at @xmath35 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in next section we will present the numerical computations of lanczos method to compare the behavior of the correlation functions on the plateau and between two plateaux .",
    "we also derive the critical exponents , and the effective hamiltonian for the latter region by using a quantum renormalization group ( qrg ) approach .",
    "the main part of this paper , the spiral ( superfluid ) state of the quantum ferrimagnets is presented in section iii .",
    "the details of the collective modes in the intermediate magnetic phase is given as the appendix in sec .",
    "in order to have more accurate physical picture , we present the numerical results , by applying a lanczos method to each @xmath37-sector of hilbert space from @xmath38 to @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the number of sites that is used in the exact diagonalization .",
    "a curve for magnetization vs. magnetic field for a chain of @xmath41-ferrimagnet has been given in ref .",
    "an extrapolation to @xmath42 on exact diagonalization calculation shows there are two plateaux of magnetization below @xmath43 and above @xmath44 , associated with the magnetization @xmath45 and @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the energy gap between the ferro- and antiferromagnetic spin wave modes of this model . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the numerical results of the in - plane spin - spin correlations is presented for a point on the plateau ( at @xmath48 ) and some intermediate points between two plateaux , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this exhibits the in - plane spin - spin correlation functions within the intermediate magnetic field region which falls off as power law , and manifests the critical behavior .",
    "thus the in - plane correlation is expected to have the asymptotic form @xmath51 .",
    "for instance we have calculated this exponent for m=@xmath52 by using data of exact diagonalization of a chain with length @xmath53 .",
    "since there are correlations between different types of sublattices we find an exponent for each case . for correlations on sublattice a ( fig.[fig2]-(a ) ) and m=@xmath52 we obtained @xmath54 and for sublattice b ( fig.[fig2]-(b ) ) we have @xmath55 .",
    "a similar behavior is seen for the correlations of different sublattices a and b ( fig.[fig2]-(c ) ) where @xmath56 . to have more qualitative picture of the transient region between two plateaux",
    ", we can use a quantum renormalization group . to perform this ,",
    "we choose two adjacent spins @xmath57 as the building block .",
    "the block hamiltonian is then @xmath58 . for low field limit ( e.g. @xmath59 )",
    "the lowest lying states of @xmath60 are a spin-1/2 doublet .",
    "this comes out with an effective hamiltonian of ferromagnetic heisenberg chain with @xmath61 in magnetic field , corresponds to the @xmath48 plateau . for high field limit @xmath62 where two states @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are nearly degenerate ,",
    "we arrive with a spin-@xmath4 antiferromagnetic @xmath65 hamiltonian .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath66    = 7.5 cm = 9.0 cm = 7.5 cm = 4.5 cm    where @xmath67 is spin-1/2 operator , @xmath68 .",
    "it is known such model hamiltonian in the presence of a magnetic field ( @xmath33 ) has a critical line which separates the partially polarized phase from the fully polarized one @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of the ferrimagnetic chain ( @xmath69 ) is related to the magnetization of @xmath65 model by @xmath70 which leads to the same behavior as the numerical results but with some discrepancies for the critical fields ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "however one may continue the quantum rg procedure for the @xmath65 model and obtain that the rg flow for the partially polarized phase ( between the two plateaux ) goes to the isotropic @xmath72 fixed point @xcite .",

    "note @xmath85 is the momentum density conjugate to field variable @xmath10 , and the hamiltonian ( [ eq9 ] ) gives a linearly dispersing collective mode , associated with the @xmath6 symmetry breaking phase , i.e. , the superfluid phase .",
    "it is easy to check how the classical solutions and the fluctuating modes can be derived by eq.([eq9 ] ) .",
    "for example @xmath86 leads to @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the energy gap of the out - of - plane modes at zero wave vector .",
