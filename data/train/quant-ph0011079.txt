    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) has continued to develop rapidly , driven both by recent experimental successes and by the promise of exciting new applications .",
    "advances in atom cooling techniques , as well as development of high  q optical cavities with large  dipole coupling , have enabled testing of the strong  coupling regime of cqed  @xcite as well as the trapping of single atoms in optical cavities  @xcite .",
    "applications of cqed , especially for such applications as the quantum logic gate  @xcite , rely critically on entanglement between the field degree of freedom and the internal electronic state of the atom  @xcite .",
    "this entanglement is not only challenging to achieve , it is also difficult to probe . in the optical regime of cqed , photon coincidence spectroscopy ( pcs ) has been proposed as a feasible and unambiguous method for detecting genuine quantum phenomena in cqed .",
    "this technique employs a bichromatic ( or multichromatic ) driving field acting on the combined atom  cavity system and detects two  photon ( or multiphoton ) decays , respectively , by registering photon coincidences in the cavity field emission  @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of pcs is two  photon coincidence spectroscopy ( 2pcs ) for probing the nonlinear portion of the jaynes  cummings ( jc ) spectrum .",
    "the technique of 2pcs proceeds , first by driving the atomic beam with a bichromatic field ( consisting of a fixed driving field with fixed frequency  @xmath1 and a scanning field with tunable frequency  @xmath2 ) , which causes two  photon excitation to the second couplet of the jc ladder , followed by two  photon decay from the atom  cavity system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] ) .",
    "the objective is to count photon pairs emitted from the cavity as a function of varying  @xmath2 .",
    "when the sum frequency for the bichromatic driving field  @xmath3 matches a transition frequency from the second couplet in the jc spectrum to the ground state , the result is an enhanced two  photon count rate ( 2pcr ) .",
    "this simple picture of excitation pathways agrees with simulations  @xcite , but displacement of coincidence peaks as a function of scanning field frequency was evident yet not properly understood  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the deviation of peak shifts is due to competition between excitation pathways .",
    "this picture yields excellent quantitative agreement with simulations of 2pcs .",
    "in the electric  dipole and rotating  wave approximations , the jc hamiltonian for the two  level atom ( 2la ) coupled with the single mode is @xmath4 with  @xmath5 the position of the atom , @xmath6 the position  dependent dipole coupling strength , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the annihilation and creation operators for photons in the cavity field , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the 2la raising , lowering and inversion operators , respectively , and @xmath12 . provided that the atoms move sufficiently slowly through the cavity @xcite , the atom can be treated as if it were at rest at some randomly located position  @xmath5 . as the position  @xmath5 is a randomly varying quantity ,",
    "the value of the coupling strength  @xmath13 itself is also random .",
    "hence , a coupling strength distribution  @xmath14 can be constructed  @xcite , and we assume the  @xmath14 depicted in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "this  @xmath14 corresponds to the coupling strength distribution obtained for atoms passing through a rectangular mask , centered at an antinode , for the cavity sustaining only the  tem@xmath15 mode .",
    "the dimension of the mask is  @xmath16 ( cavity mode waist ) by  @xmath17 ( with  @xmath18 the optical wavelength ) .",
    "we restrict  @xmath19 for  @xmath20 the coupling strength at an antinode along the cavity longitudinal axis and  @xmath21 an effective cut  off term .",
    "( 200,300)(0,-10 ) = cmr10 at 10pt    the spectrum for the hamiltonian ( [ jch ] ) , depicted in fig .  [ fig : ladder ] , is the well  known jc spectrum , or ` ladder '  @xcite .",

    "the effect of averaging over  @xmath14 is an inhomogeneous spectral broadening , due to atomic position variability , as shown in  fig .",

    "field frequency is @xmath2 , and excites the subensemble for  @xmath32 from  @xmath33 to one of the two states in the second couplet of the jc ladder , namely @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the range of scanning frequencies for @xmath2 must include the @xmath35 transition frequencies , @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the amplitudes of the two chromatic components should be large enough to ensure sufficient occupation of the excited state but not large enough that significant stark shifting or nonnegligible occupation of the higher  order states occurs .",
    "enhanced rates of photon pair detection are then sought as the scanning frequency  @xmath2 is varied such that  @xmath3 is resonant with some transition  @xmath37 as depicted in fig .",

    "the 2pcr is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] as a dotted line , and the peaks expected at  @xmath64 are not distinguishable .",
    "this indistinguishability is due to off  resonant two  photon transitions with both photons of frequency  @xmath2 , and may be overcome via the method of background subtraction : the experiment is repeated with  @xmath65 and the resultant 2pcr subtracted .",
    "thus , we define a difference2pcr @xmath66    ( 200,180)(60,10 ) = cmr10 at 10pt    for a specific set of parameters we show in fig .",

    "background subtraction helps to resolve the two two - photon spectral peaks at  @xmath69 .",
    "the objective of 2pcs is to obtain a 2pcr with peaks at values of  @xmath70 which can not be explained by semiclassical models .",
    "the peaks at  @xmath69 and  @xmath71 involve the quantity  @xmath72 , which follows from the quantum field expression @xmath73 .",
    "this  @xmath72 is therefore a genuine , unambiguous quantum field signature .",
    "however , the actual peaks in 2pcr can not be expected to occur at exactly these values of  @xmath70 as observed quite clearly in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] we show in detail the peak near  @xmath74 as a solid line for  @xmath31 and an anomalous shift from its expected position at  @xmath71 , or  @xmath75 , is evident .",

    "we observe that this peak is noticeably shifted from the expected location .",
    "the origin of the shifts in peaks is subtle . in ref .",
    "@xcite the suggestion is that `` the peaks are shifted slightly , probably due to the motion of atoms '' .",
    "although atomic motion may contribute to peak shifts , we show in this section that competition between excitation pathways is the major factor in shifts of 2pcs peaks .",
    "the peak at  @xmath71 is the most interesting of the three major 2pcr peaks ( i ) because background subtraction is not required to detect this peak ( as  @xmath70 lies outside the region of inhomogeneous broadening ) and ( ii ) because the peak is quite distinct from the large neighboring pair of peaks at  @xmath69 .",
    "the excitation pathway to obtain the peak at  @xmath71 is via an  @xmath1 photon which resonantly excites  @xmath76 , followed by an  @xmath2 photon which resonantly excites  @xmath77 for the 2pcr peak at  @xmath71 as shown in fig .",

    "the dotted line corresponds to the simulated 2pcs but with the artificial restriction that the matrix elements of the hamiltonian driving field operator  @xmath83 for the transition  @xmath84 are set to zero .",
    "that is , we artificially impose the condition @xmath85 by doing so we observe , and show in fig .  [",

    "not being set to zero , provides convincing evidence that the shift in the peak is indeed primarily due to competition between two excitation pathways .",
    "( 200,180)(60,10 ) = cmr10 at 10pt    thus far our attention has been restricted to the @xmath31 case .",
    "this case is a significant contributor to the peak shift for the inhomogeneously  broadened peak shift obtained in the full simulation , accounting for atomic position variability .",
    "the simulation of the 2pcr peak near @xmath87 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) as a solid line .",
    "this solid line evidently has a peak at @xmath88 .",
    "the above reasoning , for the @xmath31 case , suggests that the competing pathway @xmath89 is partially responsible for this peak shift .",

    "the result of this simulation is also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) as a dashed line .",
    "the new peak position is located approximately at  @xmath90 .",
    "this peak position can be shifted slightly by eliminating other pathways . by fixing all transition terms of the type  ( [ pathwayrestriction ] ) to be zero _ except _ for  @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and their complex conjugates ,",
    "the resultant peak is centered at  @xmath93 .",

    "the pathway @xmath97 is relatively unaffected by the homogeneous linewidth as it is a resonant transition at @xmath98 , but the homogeneous linewidth does enable off  resonant excitation to @xmath99 , even after the restriction ( [ pathwayrestriction ] ) has been applied .",
    "the homogeneous linewidth of the @xmath95 level enables two  photons transitions to take place for a range of coupling strength  @xmath13 , via the sequence of an @xmath1 photon and then an @xmath2 photon . by eliminating this homogeneous linewidth",
    ", the @xmath1 photons really must satisfy the condition @xmath100 in order to off  resonantly excite to the @xmath99 level .",
    "the homogeneous linewidth is responsible for permitting competing pathways from @xmath101 for a range of @xmath13 values , and eliminating this homogeneous linewidth eliminates a whole class of competing pathways for the inhomogeneously broadened ( general @xmath14 ) system .",
    "the final significant contribution to the peak shift of the 2pcr curve arises for small  @xmath13 .",
    "the low coupling strength limit is important because the distribution  @xmath14 is so heavily weighted in favor of low  @xmath13 .",

    "consequently one would expect a competing pathway to arise via excitation to @xmath103 .",
    "we eliminate the contribution due to the pathway @xmath104 . incorporating this restriction with the other restrictions previously mentioned ( eliminating the @xmath105 pathway and the homogeneous linewidth at @xmath95 ) leads to the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) .",
    "the resultant peak shift is just @xmath106 .",
    "the three effects considered above account for 87% of the peak shift .",
    "better agreement can be obtained by reducing homogeneous linewidth on the @xmath99 level or by eliminating transitions to the competing state  @xmath99 altogether .",
    "however , the agreement demonstrated here exhibits excellent agreement with the full simulated 2pcr peak at @xmath87 .",
    "there is no doubt that this shift is primarily due to competing pathways in the jc ladder .    in accounting for the peak shift due to competing pathways ,",
    "we have included restrictions of coherent transitions and thereby accounted for the majority of the peak shift .",
    "there is also competition with incoherent pathways , which are accounted for by the quantum jump terms .",
    "the quantum jumps correspond to the transfer of quanta between levels of the jc ladder , but the contribution of these jumps to peak shifts is not large for the bichromatically  driven jc system . never the less , the jump terms are responsible for part of the peak shift .",
    "this competition with incoherent pathways is quite pronounced for the monochromatically  driven three ",
    "level system discussed in the next section .",
    "the shift in spectral peaks should not be unique to a bichromatically  driven jc system .",

    "we consider the three  level truncation of the jc ladder to  @xmath107 and a monochromatic driving field which is resonant with the  @xmath108 transition ( @xmath109 ) where  @xmath1 is allowed to vary .",
    "in contrast to the previous section , enhanced one  photon count rates identify resonances and correspond to the standard method of spectroscopy , as opposed to photon _ coincidence _ spectroscopy .",
    "the normalized frequency of this driving field is  @xmath110 for  @xmath111 .",
    "we expect a peak at  @xmath112 , for which resonant excitation occurs if we ignore competition between excitation pathways .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : shiftjc3 ] we see that , for  @xmath113 , the peak is shifted to the left . competition due to off  resonant excitation",
    "is established by setting certain matrix elements of the driving term in the master equation to zero , by analogy with the 2pcr considered above .",
    "that is , for  @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) , we impose @xmath115 in the simulation .",
    "we observe that this condition produces a plot of  @xmath116 that is exactly centered at  @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the competition with the off  resonant excitation pathway  @xmath117 is entirely responsible for the peak shift of  @xmath116 vs  @xmath70 .",
    "another perspective for understanding the spectral peak shift for the driven @xmath0system is obtained directly from the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
