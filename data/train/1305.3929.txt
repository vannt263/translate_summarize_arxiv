    "this note reports the tevatron average top - quark mass obtained by combining the most precise published and preliminary measurements of the top - quark mass .",
    "it is an update of the combination presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where further details can be found .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have also performed a combination of their most recent top quark mass measurements  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations have performed several direct experimental measurements of the top - quark mass ( @xmath4 ) using data collected at the tevatron proton - antiproton collider located at the fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "these pioneering measurements were first based on approximately @xmath5 of  data  @xcite-@xcite collected from 1992 to 1996 , and included results from the decay channels @xmath6  ( alljets ) , @xmath7  ( @xmath8+jets ) , and @xmath9  ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "decays with @xmath13 are included in the direct @xmath14 and @xmath15 channels . in  ( 20012011 ) , many top mass measurements have been performed , and those considered here are the most recent results in these channels , using up to @xmath0 of data for cdf ( corresponding to the full cdf run ii dataset )  @xcite , and up to @xmath16 of data for d  @xcite . the cdf analysis based upon charged particle tracking for exploiting the transverse decay length of @xmath17-tagged jets ( @xmath18 ) and the transverse momentum of electrons and muons from @xmath19 boson decays ( @xmath20 ) uses a data set corresponding to a luminosity of 1.9  @xmath21  @xcite , and there are no plans to update this analysis .",
    "the d   measurements presented in this note include the most recent run ii measurement in the @xmath10  @xcite channel using 5.4  fb@xmath22 of data and in the @xmath8+jets channel @xcite with 3.6  fb@xmath22 of data .",
    "both results are now published .",
    "since the combination performed in 2011  @xcite , a new final state signature was introduced by cdf that requires events to possess missing transverse energy ( @xmath23 ) and jets , but no identified lepton ( `` met '' )  @xcite .",
    "this sample is statistically independent from the previous three cdf channels . with respect to the july 2011 combination@xcite and the published version of the combination  @xcite",
    ", the  cdf measurement in the @xmath8+jets channel has been updated using 8.7  fb@xmath22 of data , an improved analysis technique , and improved jet energy resolution @xcite .",
    "the cdf measurement in the met channel was updated to use the full  data set for cdf of 8.7  fb@xmath22 of data as well  @xcite .",
    "the now published  cdf measurements in the @xmath10 channel@xcite and alljets channel@xcite are unchanged .",
    "the measurement based on charged particle tracking  @xcite was incorporated as described in the past combinations  @xcite . from the corresponding analysis",
    "only the measurement of the top quark mass using the mean decay length @xmath24 of @xmath25 hadrons in @xmath17-tagged lepton+jets events has been used .",
    "it is independent of energy information in the calorimeter , and its main source of systematic uncertainty is uncorrelated with the dominant ones from the jet energy scale calibration in other measurements .",
    "this measurement of @xmath26 is essentially uncorrelated with the higher precision cdf result from the lepton+jets channel .",
    "the overlap between the data samples used for the decay - length method and the lepton+jets sample has therefore no effect .",
    "the tevatron average top - quark mass is obtained by combining five published  measurements  @xcite with four published  cdf results  @xcite , one preliminary  cdf result  @xcite , and two published  d  results  @xcite .",
    "this combination supersedes previous combinations  .",
    "the definition and evaluation of the systematic uncertainties and the understanding of the correlations among channels , experiments , and tevatron runs is the outcome of many years of joint work between the cdf and d  collaborations and is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the input measurements and uncertainty categories used in the combination are detailed in sections  [ sec : inputs ] and  [ sec : uncertainty ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations assumed in the combination are discussed in section  [ sec : corltns ] and the resulting tevatron average top - quark mass is given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a summary is presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "twelve measurements of @xmath4  used in this combination are shown in table  [ tab : inputs ] .",
    "the  measurements all have relatively large statistical uncertainties and their systematic uncertainties are dominated by the total jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainty . in both cdf and d",
    "take advantage of the larger @xmath27  samples available and employ new analysis techniques to reduce both of these uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the  d  analysis in the @xmath8+jets channel and the  cdf analyses in the @xmath8+jets , alljets , and met channels constrain the response of light - quark jets using the kinematic information from @xmath28 decays ( so - called _ in situ _ calibration )  @xcite .",
    "residual jes uncertainties associated with @xmath29 and @xmath30 dependencies as well as uncertainties specific to the response of @xmath17 jets are treated separately .",
    "the  d  @xmath10 measurement uses the jes determined in the @xmath8+jets channel by _ in situ _ calibration  @xcite .",
    ".summary of the measurements used to determine the tevatron average @xmath4 .",
    "integrated luminosity ( @xmath31 ) has units of @xmath32 , and all other numbers are in @xmath33 .",
    "the uncertainty categories and their correlations are described in section  [ sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty and the total uncertainty are obtained by adding the relevant contributions in quadrature .",
    "`` n / a '' stands for `` not applicable '' , `` n / e '' for `` not evaluated '' . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : three_observables ]    to test the influence of the choices in modeling the correlations , we performed a cross - check by changing all non - diagonal correlation coefficients of the correlation matrix defined in section  [ sec : corltns ] from 100% to 50% and re - evaluated the combination .",
    "the result of this large variation of degree of correlation is a @xmath34 shift of the top - quark mass and reduces the total uncertainty negligibly .",
    "the chosen approach is therefore conservative .",
    "we also performed separate combinations of all the cdf and d  measurements .",
    "the results of these combinations are @xmath35 for cdf and @xmath36 for d . taking all correlations into account",
    ", we calculate the chi - square value @xmath37 corresponding to a probability of 13% .",
    "an update of the combination of measurements of the mass of the top quark from the tevatron experiments cdf and d  has been presented .",
    "this preliminary combination includes five published  measurements , six published  measurements , and one preliminary  measurement , but the majority of these measurements are not yet performed on the full datasets available . taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations , the preliminary result for the tevatron average is @xmath38 , where the total uncertainty is obtained assuming gaussian systematic uncertainties .",
    "the central value is 0.02gev/@xmath39 higher than our july 2012 average  @xcite of @xmath40gev/@xmath39 . adding in quadrature the statistical and systematic uncertainties yields a total uncertainty of @xmath41 which represents an improvement of @xmath42 .",
    "the mass of the top quark is now known with a relative precision of 0.50% , limited by the systematic uncertainties , which are dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "this result will be further improved when all analysis channels from cdf and d  using the full run  ii data set are finalized .",
    "we thank the fermilab staff and the technical staffs of the participating institutions for their vital contributions .",
