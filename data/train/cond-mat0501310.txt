    "granular materials are the particle systems in which the size of particle is large and the effect of thermal agitation is negligible@xcite . recently there has been much interest in the physics of noncohesive granular materials lying on a vertically vibrating surface . when the vibration intensity is large , the granular systems show the properties of fluids , such as convection@xcite , heaping@xcite , traveling surface waves@xcite , pattern formation@xcite , and size segregation@xcite . when the vibration intensity is small , disordered granular materials become jammed , behaving like a system with infinite viscosity .",
    "after liu and nagel proposed an idea unifying the glass transition and the jamming behavior@xcite , the behavior of the jamming transition has been studied extensively@xcite . in this model , the inverse density of the system @xmath2 , temperature @xmath3 , and stress @xmath4 form the axes of a three - dimensional phase diagram , with the jammed state in the inner octant and the unjammed state outside . in athermal macroscopic systems like granular materials ,",
    "thermal temperature does not play any important role .",
    "instead , it is an effective temperature that relates the random motion of the particles .",
    "when jammed by lowering the effective temperature , the system is caught in a small region of phase space with no possibility of escape . for thermal systems , if the molecules are bulky and of irregular shape , or if the liquid is cooled too rapidly for the crystalline structure to form , at low temperature it vitrifies into a rigid phase that retains the disordered molecular arrangements of the liquid , creating a glass state .",
    "if the idea of the jamming phase diagram is correct , one can apply many ideas of the glass transition to explain the jamming behavior in athermal systems .    in order to study the dynamics of granular systems",
    ", one might want to track the motion of the individual particles .",
    "however , due to the opacity of the granular systems , most experimental work has been limited to the study of the external features of the granular flow or the motion of tracer particles .",
    "recently , noninvasive experimental techniques using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , positron emission particle tracking ( pept ) , and diffusing - wave spectroscopy ( dws ) have overcome the problem of opacity in the three - dimensional granular system and have made observation of internal features of the flow possible@xcite .",
    "since the spatiotemporal scale of the particle fluctuations is much smaller than the resolution of mri and pept , only dws can provide a statistical description of a highly dense system of small particles with adequate resolution@xcite . to briefly explain the dws technique , photons are scattered consecutively by many particles in a highly dense medium .",
    "this diffusive nature of light in a strongly scattered medium results in a scattered light intensity that fluctuates with time .",
    "thus the temporal decay of the light intensity autocorrelation function is used to study very small relative motions of the scatterers in the medium .",
    "the dws technique has been successfully applied to study the motion of granular particles in a channel flow , a gas - fluidized bed , an avalanche flow , and a vibro - fluidized bed@xcite .    in this paper , the fluidization and jamming process of a thick and highly dense three - dimensional vibro - fluidized granular bed",
    "is studied using dws .",
    "exploring the temperature axis of the jamming phase diagram@xcite , we compare our experimental result with theoretical concepts developed in the study of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition .",
    "our result provides strong evidence of the analogy between the dynamics of granular materials and the behavior of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition .",
    "figure 1 is a simple schematic diagram of the experimental setup .",
    "a 180 mm high , 90 mm wide ( @xmath5 ) , and 10 mm thick ( @xmath6 ) rectangular glass vessel is filled with glass beads of diameter @xmath7 m at the total depth of @xmath8 mm .",
    "an electromagnetic shaker vibrates the vessel vertically with the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the amplitude and @xmath11 is the frequency of the vibration .",
    "one can construct a dimensionless acceleration amplitude , whose maximum value is @xmath12 where @xmath1 is the gravitational acceleration@xcite .",
    "the vessel is much heavier than the total mass of the glass beads so that the collisions of the vessel with the granular medium do not disturb its vertical vibration .",
    "the air inside the vessel is evacuated below the pressure of 0.1torr , where the volumetric effect of the gas can be neglected@xcite .",
    "the acceleration amplitude @xmath13 and the vibration frequency @xmath11 are monitored by the accelerometer which is positioned on the vessel .",
    "all the data are taken in a steady state condition where the system is well compacted@xcite .",
    "for the dws measurements , an ar laser beam with the wavelength of 488 nm is directed on the wide side of the vessel , and the transmitted light intensity is detected by a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "the center of scattering volume is located at the position ( @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 is the horizontal distance from the central - vertical axis of the vessel and @xmath16 is the vertical distance below the free surface . the intensity output @xmath17 of the pmt",
    "is fed to a computer - controlled digital correlator ( bi9000at ; brookhaven inst . ) .",
    "the intensity autocorrelation function , which is calculated by the digital correlator , is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a delay time , @xmath20 is a factor determined by the optical geometry of the experiment@xcite , and the bracket indicates a time average . in a highly dense granular medium ,",
    "incident photons are multiply scattered by the glass beads . when the beads in the medium move , the intensity @xmath17 measured at the detector fluctuates with time .",
    "thus the intensity autocorrelation function has the information of the movement of the beads in the medium .",
    "when @xmath17 is periodic , there are echoes in the correlation function at the integral multiples of the oscillation period@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the position of the incident laser beam is fixed and the scattering medium vibrates with the form of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore when all the particles in the scattering volume exhibit perfectly reversible periodic motion , the correlation function will return to its initial value 1[=@xmath22 at each multiple of the oscillation period .",
    "when only a fraction of the scatterers undergoes a reversible motion in the scattering volume , the height of the echoes will decay in time .",
    "lastly , when all the scatterers exhibit an irreversible motion , there is no echo in the correlation function .",
    "therefore the degree of fluidization can be characterized by the decay time of the height of the echoes in @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the correlation function at various dimensionless accelerations at the position ( @xmath23 mm , @xmath24 mm ) in the case of the vibration frequency of @xmath25hz and the granular bed of @xmath8 mm .",
    "when the maximum acceleration is smaller than the gravitational acceleration , @xmath26 , the correlation function oscillates with echoes at every multiple of the period @xmath3(@xmath27 )",
    ". here , the height of each echo does not change , that is @xmath28 .",
    "since the photons meet the same scattering volume at every vibration period , @xmath28 implies that there is no relative movement of the particles in the scattering volume .",
    "this suggests that the granular system is solidlike at @xmath26 , where the viscosity of the system appears to diverge .",
    "as the dimensionless acceleration is increased above @xmath29 , however , the height of the echoes in the correlation function relax in time . at a certain critical dimensionless acceleration @xmath30",
    ", the height of the first echo disappears completely , [ @xmath31 . for @xmath32",
    ", @xmath0 decays very rapidly without any echoes .",
    "this implies that at @xmath33 , the particle positions become completely randomized by the external vibrations and the statistical description of the internal motion becomes important . in this sense",
    ", @xmath30 is the critical dimensionless acceleration where the scattering volume becomes fluidized .",
    "this fast decay in @xmath0 at @xmath32 contains information about the short - time dynamics of the granular particles@xcite .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the height of the first echo @xmath34 as a function of @xmath13 at different vertical positions @xmath16 . for a given position inside the vessel , the height of the first echo decreases monotonically with @xmath13 .",
    "thus the fraction of the particles which undergo an irreversible motion increases with @xmath13 . to determine @xmath30 ,",
    "the data points are fitted with the function , @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the critical dimensionless acceleration @xmath30 at various horizontal positions @xmath15 with @xmath16=50 mm and @xmath25hz . note that @xmath30 is independent of the horizontal position .",
    "figure 3(b ) plots @xmath30 as a function of the vertical position @xmath16 with @xmath23 mm in the case of @xmath25hz and @xmath8 mm .",
    "the critical value of the dimensionless acceleration increases linearly with the distance from the free surface , except near the free surface of the granular system .",
    "the solid line in this figure is a straight line with a slope of 0.0034 .",
    "the result that @xmath30 is nearly @xmath36 near the free surface of the granular system agrees with many previous experimental studies@xcite .",
    "figure 3(c ) shows @xmath30 at various total depths @xmath37 in the case of the fixed position ( @xmath23 mm , @xmath24 mm ) .",
    "no dependence of @xmath30 on the total depth @xmath37 suggests that the relevant parameters in the fluidization process are just the distance from the free surface , @xmath16 , and @xmath30 . according to this picture , when the maximum acceleration is larger than the gravitational acceleration ( @xmath38 ) , there is a liquid - solid interface in the granular system .",
    "the upper part of the system is liquidlike and the lower part is solidlike , and the position of the interface depends on @xmath13 .      at @xmath39 , we observe a dramatic slowing down of the relaxation in the height of the echoes with decreasing @xmath13 .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the height of the echoes of the correlation function @xmath40 up to a delay time of several hundred vibration periods .",
    "the unit of time in this figure is the vibration period @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that the dynamics of granular particles undergoes structural relaxation below @xmath30 .",
    "the data points are fitted with a stretched exponential decay function , @xmath41.\\ ] ] here , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath42 depends on @xmath13 .",
    "the fitting parameters of the stretched exponential decay function are @xmath43 , @xmath42 , and @xmath44 . during the fitting process",
    ", the value of @xmath43 is fixed at @xmath45 , which is chosen from the data at @xmath46 when the delay time approaches to @xmath47 . in the theory of the glass transition ,",
    "the value of @xmath43 depends on the scattering geometry and depends little on temperature and density@xcite .",
    "the fixed value of @xmath43 is the major reason for the poor fitting at @xmath48 .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the same data with the scaled horizontal axis of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "all the data collapse well on a straight line with a small value of the parameter @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ( here , @xmath51 implies a simple exponential relaxation@xcite ) .",
    "this collapse is analogous to the behavior of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath42 at various @xmath13 from the same data in fig.4 . here , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath42 increases rapidly as @xmath13 approaches a specific value .",
    "the solid line in this figure is a fit with the form of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the power law divergence of the characteristic relaxation time is similar with that of mode coupling theory ( mct ) .",
    "according to mct , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath42 at a temperature @xmath3 in the glassy relaxation process is of the form @xmath55@xcite . here , @xmath56 is a dynamical crossover temperature from a liquidlike to a solidlike regime , and is located between the glass transition temperature @xmath57 and the melting transition temperature @xmath58@xcite . from the analogy between the dynamics of the granular materials under vertical vibration and that of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition , one expects that the effective temperature of the granular system under vertical vibration is related to the dimensionless acceleration",
    ". therefore we conjecture that @xmath30 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in the dynamics of the granular materials under vertical vibration correspond to @xmath58 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in the behavior of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition .",
    "the jamming process of a highly dense three - dimensional granular system under vertical vibration is experimentally studied using the dws technique . at @xmath61 ,",
    "the granular system behaves like fluids . at @xmath62 ,",
    "the system is arrested in the glassy state , where the viscosity of the system appears to diverge . at @xmath63",
    ", the structural relaxation shows a stretched exponential behavior and the divergence of the characteristic relaxation time @xmath42 can be described by the power law function which is similar to mct .",
    "this behavior provides the evidence of the analogy between the dynamics of granular materials and the behavior of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition .",
