    "it has been observed that a wide variety of heavy fermion superconductors appear to undergo multiple phase transitions within the superconducting state .",
    "these materials include upt@xmath0@xcite , u@xmath3th@xmath4be@xmath5@xcite and pros@xmath1sb@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the fact that multiple transitions are being observed in such a significant fraction of the total number of heavy fermion superconductors discovered is presumably providing a valuable insight into the nature of the superconducting state . among the heavy fermion superconductors showing multiple phase transitions ,",
    "upt@xmath0 has been most extensively studied .",
    "it has a hexagonal point group symmetry and shows two transitions with a small ( about 10% ) splitting of the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "three main approaches have been used to theoretically model the phase diagram of upt@xmath0 and it would be of interest to see if any of these approaches apply to the other materials .",
    "the first approach uses a weak symmetry breaking field ( sbf ) to break the hexagonal symmetry .",
    "this field lifts the degeneracy of a multi - component order parameter leading to two transitions @xcite .",
    "the origin of this symmetry breaking field has been questioned@xcite and other proposals have emerged .",
    "zhitomirsky and ueda have postulated a weak crystal field model in which spin singlet cooper pairs experience an approximate spherical symmetry which is weakly broken to hexagonal symmetry @xcite . along similar lines , machida and co -",
    "workers have postulated a weak spin orbit coupling for spin - triplet cooper pairs@xcite .",
    "the third approach uses a phenomenological model which considers two different irreducible representations of the hexagonal point group that accidentally have nearly the same @xmath6 @xcite . in all these cases , it is possible to develop microscopic theories based on weak coupling theory that give rise to the two transitions and such theories have been useful in developing a qualitative understanding of this superconductor @xcite .    among the materials with cubic or tetrahedral point group symmetry : u@xmath3th@xmath4be@xmath5 and pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 have shown multiple superconducting transitions .",
    "both these materials have been the subject of phenomenological studies .",
    "u@xmath3th@xmath4be@xmath5 has been studied using a phenomenological approach by sigrist and rice @xcite while pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 has been examined phenomenologically by goryo @xcite , ichioka et .",
    "al.@xcite , matsunaga et .",
    "al.@xcite , and more recently by sergienko and curnoe@xcite .",
    "there have been a variety of microscopic proposals for the superconducting states in pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that none of these microscopic theory attempts to provide an origin for the two transitions for cubic or tetrahedral materials .",
    "existing microscopic theories predict the properties of the a phase but are forced to make ad - hoc assumptions about the origin of the transition in the b phase .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of upt@xmath0 where microscopic justification for the second transition exist based on weak coupling theories @xcite .",
    "+ in the hope of identifying a common origin to multiple transitions for heavy fermion superconductors , we apply the conceptual frameworks developed for hexagonal upt@xmath0 to cubic and tetrahedral superconductors .",
    "one goal is to examine under what circumstances weak coupling bcs provides a microscopic description of the two transitions .",
    "we expect that bcs theory will capture a large contribution to the condensation energy of these heavy fermion superconductors and therefore provides a reasonable basis for such studies .",
    "this is partially justified by the agreement between the observed size of the specific heat jumps at @xmath6 and that predicted by weak coupling theories . in neither u@xmath3th@xmath4be@xmath5 nor pros@xmath1sb@xmath2",
    "has any weak symmetry breaking fields been identified .",
    "therefore , we begin by exploring possible higher symmetry groups that are weakly broken .",
    "we consider two higher symmetries groups .",
    "the first is motivated by weak crystal field theory of zhitomirsky and ueda for upt@xmath0@xcite . in this theory",
    ", the spin - singlet superconducting state has an approximate spherical symmetry @xmath7 which is weakly broken to cubic or tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "we next consider the possibility of weak spin - orbit coupling so that the spin - triplet superconductor has an approximate @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "we find that weak coupling theory for only the latter of these two higher symmetries allow for one possible scenario for two transitions . the sequence of transitions found this way does not agree with experimental data for pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 .",
    "we further show that the weak crystal field theory does allow for two transitions when strong coupling corrections are included .",
    "however , the condensation energy associated with the strong coupling corrections must be comparable to that of weak coupling theory to account for experimental results on the specific heat .",
    "these results indicate that a weak coupling theory does not provide an adequate description of the superconducting state within the context of weakly broken higher symmetry groups .",
    "given the failure of weak coupling theory for pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 in the above context , we finally ask if it is possible for weak coupling theory to provide a description of the two transitions that agrees with the experimental results .",
    "we find that it is possible for such an approach to succeed and give one example of when it does .",
    "however , without the constraints imposed by higher symmetries , a general analysis of resulting weak coupling theories is not possible and requires a detailed knowledge of the quasi particles within the material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we initially provide an overview of experimental results for pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 and u@xmath3th@xmath4be@xmath5 .",
    "then we provide an analysis that results in all the possible high temperature superconducting phases allowed within weak coupling theory for cubic and tetrahedral superconductors .",
    "finally , we examine the origin of the second transition within the frameworks discussed above .",
    "the heavy fermion superconductor pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 is the first among the rare - earth filled skutterudite compounds showing a superconducting behavior .",
    "it undergoes a normal to superconducting transition with @xmath9 k ( the high temperature phase is known as the a phase ) followed by another transition at @xmath10 k from the a phase to the b phase .",
    "this second transition shows up as a pronounced anomaly in the specific heat and magnetization measurements@xcite .",
    "note that the specific heat measurements by measson _",
    "et al . _ have raised questions about the intrinsic nature of the double superconducting transition@xcite .",
    "various experiments have reported a similar field dependance of the h@xmath11 curve for both the transition temperatures@xcite .",
    "though the symmetry and type of nodes of the gap structure in the a phase remains inconclusive , experiments suggest the presence of two point nodes in the b phase .",
    "this has been observed by the power law temperature dependance in specific heat@xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite and penetration depth measurements@xcite .",
    "a possible third phase transition(@xmath12 has been observed as an enhancement of the lower critical field @xmath13 below t@xmath14 k@xcite .",
    "interestingly this anomaly has not been detected by specific heat measurements at low temperatures .",
    "experiments have also observed local broken time reversal symmetry in the superconducting phase through @xmath15sr measurements@xcite .",
    "+ one experimental result on pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 which has not received much theoretical attention yet provides a strong constraint is the low field measurement of the vortex lattice geometry .",
    "the key result is that the vortex lattice is not hexagonal near h@xmath16 for the field along the @xmath17 axis@xcite .",
    "as the authors of @xcite have pointed out , this is a strong constraint because this lattice structure results from a london free energy whose form depends upon the symmetry of the superconduting state .",
    "the london free energy can be expanded in powers of the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath18 of the vortex lattice .",
    "the form of the free energy is @xcite @xmath19\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the penetration depth and @xmath21 is the normalized london effective mass tensor whose components in weak coupling theory for a singlet superconductor is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the @xmath24 component of fermi velocity and @xmath25 representing the gap magnitude .",
    "we are justified in keeping @xmath18 terms up to second order near h@xmath16 because in this region @xmath18 has a small magnitude being approximately given by @xmath26 .",
    "if we consider that the gap to be invariant under a three fold rotation we find that the components of the effective mass tensor are given by @xmath27 this situation would result in a hexagonal vortex lattice near h@xmath16 .",
    "no other symmetry element of the tetrahedral point group implies a hexagonal vortex lattice .",
    "since the observed vortex lattice is not hexagonal near @xmath28 , we conclude that superconducting state does not contain a three fold symmetry axis .",
    "the alloy u@xmath3th@xmath4be@xmath5 which has cubic point group symmetry shows two second order superconducting transition for concentration of thorium exceeding @xmath29 in specific heat measurements @xcite .",
    "a pronounced peak has been observed in the ultrasonic attenuation for longitudinal sound propagated along a [ 100 ] direction at @xmath30@xcite .",
    "measurements by bishop _",
    "_ found a similar behavior for longitudinal sound propagated along the [ 111 ] direction@xcite .",
    "significant anomalies have been observed in @xmath13 at @xmath30@xcite and the zero field @xmath15sr line width shows a marked increase as @xmath31 decreases below @xmath32 in samples with @xmath33@xcite .",
    "finally lambert _ et al .",
    "_ found differences in the pressure dependance of @xmath6 for @xmath34 and @xmath35@xcite .",
    "for all the theories we consider , the initial transition into the superconducting state is characterized by either cubic or tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "therefore , this transition is described by a single order parameter symmetry . here",
    ", we provide a general analysis of the possible superconducting states that weak - coupling theory allows for this phase .",
    "a similar analysis of this problem has appeared recently by kuznetsova and barzykin@xcite .",
    "however , we find that weak coupling theory provides even stronger constraints than found in this work . as a consequence ,",
    "some of the phases found by these authors are ruled out .",
    "+ the cubic group o@xmath36 has ten irreducible representations ( irreps ) that are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the tetrahedral group has one three dimensional irrep and three one dimensional irreps , two of which are complex conjugate and combine to form a single irrep when time reversal symmetry is present . in this section",
    "we study the superconducting phases of materials with cubic and tetrahedral point group symmetry whose basis functions transform as a multidimensional representation .",
    ".the irrep and corresponding representative basis functions for even and odd parity states of cubic symmetry [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table  [ table5 ] we find that for @xmath37 the lowest 3 fourth order energies in increasing order correspond to states @xmath38 .",
    "we do not find any second order weak coupling transitions within this range .",
    "for @xmath39 the lowest 3 fourth order energies in increasing order correspond to states @xmath40 . in this case",
    "we find only one stable second order transition from the state @xmath41 in the a phase to a b phase where it mixes to the state @xmath42 with a transition temperature @xmath43 the specific heat jump ratio at the transition temperatures is given by @xmath44    we find that a specific heat jump ratio that is comparable to observed value for the skutterudite pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 which is about one@xcitecan be obtained if the gap functions contain substantial cubic anisotropy .",
    "in addition this situation will result in a anisotropic state with two fold degeneracy .",
    "this sequence of phase transition would also result in a distorted vortex lattice structure owing to the large anisotropy of this state as shown in figure 1 .",
    "= 3.0 in    we find that in many cases , the a to b transition is first order .",
    "the reason for this is as follows : for two order parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 the free energy takes the form @xmath47 let @xmath48 and minimize with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "the the free energy becomes @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "here we have assumed the basis functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 to be real .",
    "if there is a second transition then it is second order transition when @xmath54 , otherwise it is first order . in our calculations",
    "@xmath55 is too large , which leads to the first order transitions .",
    "this is a consequence of the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 that have been chosen .",
    "however we can get a second order transition by considering a two band theory for which @xmath52 is large and @xmath53 is small in one band while @xmath53 is large and @xmath52 is small on the other",
    ". then the condition @xmath54 will be easily satisfied and a second order a@xmath56b phase transition can exist for almost any two different order parameter irreps .",
    "we have considered microscopic theories of unconventional superconductivity in cubic and tetrahedral superconductors .",
    "we have identified the stable weak - coupling unconventional superconducting states that belong to a single irreducible representation and have highlighted which of these can describe the low temperature properties of pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 .",
    "we have further examined theories for two intrinsic superconducting transitions in pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 .",
    "we have found that a theory for which the two transitions are due to a weakly broken @xmath7 symmetry for spin singlet cooper pairs can not give rise to two transitions in the weak - coupling limit . however , it is possible for such a theory to produce two transitions that agree with the experimental properties of pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 only when extended to the strong coupling limit .",
    "we further find that for spin - triplet cooper pairs , weak spin - orbit coupling in the weak - coupling limit does not give rise to two superconducting transitions that agree with the experimental properties of pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 .",
    "finally , we consider an example of a weak coupling theory that does not assume an approximate higher symmetry , but is based on the accidental closeness of the transition temperatures for two different representations .",
    "this example is able to describe the observed properties of pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 .",
