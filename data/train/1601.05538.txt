    "moreover , unlike in conventional tis where there is a odd number of dirac points , the weyl nodes in dsms occur in pairs with one member of each pair acting as a berry curvature source and the other member acting as a berry curvature sink .",
    "these pairs of weyl nodes in dsms give rise to surface states in the form of fermi arcs linking the two points in @xmath0-space when the bulk dsm is truncated perpendicular to the direction of the @xmath0-space separation between the weyl nodes .",

    "we study the effects of in - plane magnetic fields on dsm thin films . to lay the foundations for our subsequent discussion , we first review the energy dispersion of bulk and the emergence of fermi arcs on semi - infinite slabs of terminated perpendicular to the @xmath0-space separation between the weyl nodes .",
    "we then consider dsm thin films with finite thickness , and next move on to discuss the effects of in - plane magnetic fields on the dispersion relations .",
    "we finally showcase one consequence of the magnetic fields by considering the transmission from a source dsm thin film segment without a magnetic field , to a drain dsm segment with a magnetic field for various directions of magnetic fields and source - drain interfaces .",

    "[ gecef50bycomb ] . here since the interface is parallel to the @xmath15 direction @xmath12 is conserved . from the figure it is evident that as @xmath80 is increased the eecs of the drain states are shifted towards larger @xmath63 so that the @xmath12 overlap between the source eec centered around @xmath78 and the drain eecs decreases and eventually drops to 0 .",
    "we now look at what happens when we fix @xmath80 and vary the energy .",
    "differing from the transmission profiles considered earlier , here we have at larger values of @xmath80 a trend where the transmission at a given value of @xmath79 first drops to 0 as the energy is increased , and then increases from 0 as the energy is increased further .",
    "the region where the transmission is 0 essentially coincides with the energy band gap that opens up between the lepb and hehb .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath100 at the energies labeled on the legend .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath12 dispersion relation for @xmath101 at @xmath77 with the dotted horizontal lines indicating the energy levels at which the eecs are drawn ]    this is also reflected in fig .",
    "[ gecby02comb ] which show the source and drain eecs at @xmath102 , and @xmath103 and @xmath88 .",
    "these energies correspond to those at the value of @xmath79 where the transmission decreases between @xmath104 to @xmath82 , then increases between @xmath82 to @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath104 drain eec has a relative large @xmath18 overlap with eec due to the middle eec curve enclosing @xmath105 which corresponds to the cross section of the hepb .",
    "the next value of energy @xmath82 corresponds to an energy where the @xmath0-space range enclosed by the source eec falls in the gap between the hehb and lepb and the transmission is zero .",
    "the topmost value of energy is above the bottom of the lepb where the eecs corresponding to the cross section of the lepb increase in @xmath0 space area and start to overlap with the source eec again , giving rise to finite transmission .",
    "in this work we studied the effects of in - plane magnetic fields on a dsm thin film .",
    "we showed that in the absence of a magnetic field , there is a special band , the lepb , which originates from the semi - infinite slab fermi arcs , and is localized near the surface of the thin films .",
    "the application of a magnetic field in the @xmath14 direction leads to the sharpening of the lepb band bottom and hehb band top at @xmath81 , and a shifting of the energy where the lepb and hepb meet at @xmath81 upwards when the field is first applied . as the field",
    "is increased further , the energy of the lepb band at @xmath81 is shifted above that of the @xmath0-space vicinity and an energy gap opens between the lepb and hehb . applying a magnetic field in the @xmath15 direction leads to the broadening of the lepb and the formation of an energy plateau along the @xmath0 space @xmath14 direction .",
    "these changes affect the transmission from a source segment without a magnetic field to a drain segment with a magnetic field as the overlap in the @xmath0-space direction parallel to the interface between the source and drain eecs varies . in the particular case of an interface parallel to the @xmath14 direction and magnetic field in the @xmath15 direction ,",
    "the @xmath0 space overlap is not very much affected by the magnitude of the field .",
    "the reduction in transmission comes instead from the reduction in spatial overlap between the source and drain wavefunctions when the drain wavefunctions get localized further inside the thickness of the film away from the source wavefunction localized near the film surface .    after the completion of this manuscript , we learnt of a very recent work @xcite on the effects of in - plane magnetic fields on weyl and dirac semimetals . in that work",
    ", the authors reasoned that an in - plane magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath0 space separation between the weyl nodes ( the @xmath15 direction here ) leads to a range of @xmath16 perpendicular to the field in which there is no dispersion along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "this agrees with our numerical results in fig . 8a . whereas ref .",
    "did not explicitly study an in - plane field magnetic field with only components perpendicular to the weyl node @xmath0-space separation , its authors did study an in - plane field applied at an angle to the @xmath0-space separation .",
    "our results support their conclusion that the components of the in - plane field perpendicular to the @xmath0-space separation ( @xmath80 ) will lead to a shearing of the eec along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "our eecs for a magnetic field in the @xmath14 direction in fig .",
    "10 shows that @xmath89 pushes the regions of the eec with differing signs of @xmath16 in opposite directions along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "our results show the additional feature that at large values of @xmath89 , this shearing causes the eec to break up into separate closed curves .",
