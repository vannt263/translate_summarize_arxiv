    "the answer depends only on @xmath15 and the topological knot type :    [ pro : kauffman - bound]there is a homomorphism @xmath156 if and only if the kauffman bound @xmath157 ( see @xcite ) is sharp .",
    "the kauffman bound for @xmath0 is achieved if and only if a front diagram for @xmath0 admits an ungraded normal ruling @xcite , which happens if and only if @xmath5 admits an ungraded augmentation @xcite .",
