    "figure  [ fig : stacks ] ( right panel ) shows that all 4 independent measurements on the southern half of the arc are redshifted , while all 4 measurements on the northern half are blueshifted with respect to @xmath93 measured in the central spatial bin .",
    "the presence of rotation with the same directional sense in independent data sets gives us significantly higher confidence in its reality .    to compare the rotational velocity of rg1m0150  with other samples , we must account for observational effects , particularly the seeing , slit width , and binning .",

    "( see @xcite for a quite similar approach . ) the dynamical model is constructed in the source plane , then lensed , convolved by the seeing , and binned like the data .",
    "the model is constrained by the rotation points ( figure  [ fig : stacks ] ) and @xmath96 . fortuitously , the slit pa of @xmath28 , which is aligned with the direction of magnification , is close to the major axis pa ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the inferred dynamical mass is @xmath10 when marginalizing over the unknown inclination @xmath98 .",
    "here we choose @xmath99 because it corresponds to a maximum intrinsic ellipticity @xmath100 .",
    "although the intrinsic @xmath101 is sensitive to inclination , the projected value that we measure is not .",
    "the inferred @xmath94 is also insensitive to inclination except when the galaxy is close to face - on ( this result is generic in jeans dynamical modeling , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , when fixing @xmath102 we find that that the inferred @xmath94 would increase significantly by 0.16  dex .",
    "adopting any inclination @xmath103 that is even slightly larger , however , affects @xmath94 by @xmath104  dex .    adopting a local virial calibration @xmath105",
    "would have given a slightly smaller mass .",
    "@xmath94 is smaller than , but consistent with , our estimate of @xmath106 .",

    "a central question in the evolution of etgs is the extent to which the quenching of star formation and the transformation of stellar structure , morphology , and kinematics proceed together ( e.g. , in one major merger episode ) or in several distinct events .",
    "the presence of compact quiescent galaxies at high redshift demonstrates that growth of the stellar distribution proceeds long after quenching .",
    "recent examinations of the evolving ellipticities of quiescent galaxies suggest that these early , compact systems were also more disk - like @xcite .",

    "intriguingly , we find that rg1m0150  indeed lies close in figure  5 to their simulated merger remnants , which are compact systems with @xmath118 and @xmath119  kpc comparable to typical @xmath120 quiescent galaxies .",
    "simulations by @xcite predict that the gas in compact quiescent galaxies and their immediate star - forming progenitors is kinematically colder than the stars , i.e. , has higher @xmath108 .",

    "we find that the stellar and gas line widths are closer in rg1m0150 , with @xmath125 , but larger samples will be needed to test this hypothesis due to the strong inclination dependence .    nearly all local etgs with @xmath126 ( scaled to a chabrier imf ) are `` slow rotators '' with @xmath108 much smaller than rg1m0150  ( red points in figure  [ fig : vsigma ] ) .",
    "our best estimate for the stellar mass of rg1m0150  already places it within this range . even allowing a somewhat smaller mass ( e.g. , our @xmath94 ) , it is quite likely that rg1m0150  will evolve into a slow rotator : empirical estimates based on number density arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , so significant later star formation is unlikely .",
    "if rg1m0150  is typical , this suggests that the progenitors of giant ellipticals are still rotating significantly after they have been quenched and must reduce their net angular momentum later .",
    "a sequence of mostly dry mergers , suspected of driving the observed @xmath128 growth in effective radius , might provide a physical explanation .",
