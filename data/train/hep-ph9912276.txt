    "when isaac newton formulated his law of universal gravity over 300 years ago , he provided the first mathematical description of one of the fundamental forces of nature . yet",
    ", physicists have realized only relatively recently that tests of newtonian gravity can still provide a unique window into new physics @xcite . within the past 20 years , experimentalists have put newtonian gravity to the test for distance scales @xmath2@xmath4 m by searching for violations of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) and inverse square law ( isl ) . the fact that no such violations have been observed places stringent constraints on extensions of the standard model that would naturally lead to such effects @xcite . despite this effort , a number of authors have pointed out that very little is known of the validity of newtonian gravity at distances @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "several experimental groups are currently attempting to extend these limits down to @xmath5 m @xcite , which is near the point where casimir / van der waals forces overcome gravity to become the dominant force between neutral , non - magnetic bodies .",
    "this strong intermolecular force background will become a major challenge for experimentalists who attempt to probe gravity at much smaller distances .",
    "the purpose of this paper is show that such experiments are worth the effort despite the new difficulties , and to suggest ideas which may be useful in detecting new forces of gravitational strength against a strong intermolecular force background .",
    "we begin by examining the theoretical motivation for studying newtonian gravity and the phenomenology used to characterize non - newtonian effects which would be the signal of new physics in a gravity experiment .",
    "after briefly reviewing the current constraints on new forces achieved by longer distance gravity experiments ( @xmath6 m ) , we will see that new problems arise when one attempts to set comparable limits in the casimir / van der waals regime ( @xmath3  m ) where intermolecular forces become large .",
    "we then investigate these problems quantitatively by computing the forces between two parallel plates over a range of separations .",
    "finally , we propose two schematic designs for null experiments designed to subtract out the unwanted intermolecular and gravitational backgrounds using the `` iso - electronic '' and `` finite - size '' effects",
    ". these will hopefully allow one to search for signals of new physics at very short distances in the presence of casimir / van der waals forces .",
    "the standard model currently provides an adequate description of the electromagnetic , weak , and strong interactions within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "however , a consistent description of quantum gravity has yet to be formulated despite intense work over the past fifty years .",
    "the lack of a quantum theory of gravity currently provides much of the motivation for studying extensions of the standard model which would bring all the fundamental forces into the quantum realm .",
    "in fact , many believe that the present standard model is really only an effective theory which would be superseded at much higher energies by a more fundamental theory , such as string or m - theory @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems with these more fundamental theories is that , despite their purported mathematical beauty , many of their principal consequences lay far beyond the reach of most foreseeable experiments .",
    "it is therefore vital to investigate the low - energy limits of these fundamental theories to allow experimentalists the opportunity to constrain the proliferation of models which would otherwise go unchecked .",
    "it is against this backdrop that one should view recent and future experiments testing newtonian gravity .",
    "many extensions of the standard model , including string theory , contain new light bosons which would manifest themselves as new fundamental forces@xcite .",
    "these new forces would compete with the other known forces , but they would most likely be revealed in a gravity experiment for several reasons .",
    "first , in many ways gravity remains the least understood of the fundamental forces and is relatively untested over a wide range of distance scales .",
    "second , any new forces probably couple very weakly with matter  otherwise they would have been seen already .",
    "since gravity is by far the weakest fundamental force , it sets a natural scale from which to measure new weak forces .",
    "third , there are two signatures of gravity which help one extract a signal from the background of other forces : 1 ) since the gravitational force couples to mass , it obeys the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) , so violations of the wep would indicate the presence of a non - gravitational force .",
    "2 ) the newtonian gravitational force between point particles obeys an inverse square law ( isl ) , hence any departures from the isl might be attributed to new forces . finally , newtonian gravity is the weak - field , non - relativistic limit of general relativity , a theory in which gravity is seen as a manifestation of spacetime that has been curved by mass - energy .",
    "therefore , any theory that impacts our understanding of space and time must involve gravity .",
    "this is important because string theory requires that there exist more than three spatial dimensions , the new extra dimensions being rendered invisible to current experiments by some yet - to - be - understood mechanism . as will be discussed below",
    ", recent models suggest that these new dimensions may modify newtonian gravity at short , but macroscopic , distances",
    ".      the form of the violations of newton s law of gravity arising from new physics will be to some extent model dependent , but one finds in practice that most theories yield modifications that have similar generic features @xcite .",
    "for example , suppose there exists a new vector field @xmath7 which couples to fermions via the lagrangian density @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the dimensionless vector - fermion coupling constant ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the fermion field operator .",
    "if two fermions 1 and 2 exchange a single vector boson with mass @xmath12 via this coupling , the lowest order interaction in the non - relativistic limit yields a yukawa potential @xmath13 where `` @xmath14 '' ( `` @xmath15 '' ) indicates that the force is repulsive ( attractive ) between like charges . if this was electromagnetism , massless photons give @xmath16 , and for electrons @xmath17 . in the units we use ,",
    "the range of the interaction is @xmath18 , so that @xmath19  ev gives @xmath20  cm , for example .",
    "if the exchanged bosons were scalars instead of vectors , one arrives at an attractive yukawa potential between identical fermions : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is now the scalar coupling constant .",
    "if the fermions have masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the total interaction potential including gravity and scalar / vector interactions can be written in the general form @xmath25 where @xmath26 the dimensionless constant @xmath27 then characterizes the strength of the interaction relative to gravity , and its sign depends on type of boson exchanged . when @xmath28 , @xmath29 indicates a force of gravitational strength .",
    "yukawa potentials also arise naturally in models where new gravitational forces appear from extra spatial dimensions .",
    "string theory requires there to be more than 3 spatial dimensions , but until recently it was thought that all the extra dimensions were compactified on the planck scale and thus invisible to any conceivable experiment",
    ". however , much attention recently has focused on a number of string - inspired models in which all standard model particles are confined to the usual 3 spatial dimensions ( a 3-brane ) while gravity can `` see '' all dimensions@xcite . in such models",
    ", one would never expect to see the effects of extra dimensions in standard model physics , but their effects would appear in gravitational physics . since so much of the parameter space of gravity remains unexplored , these effects could have easily escaped detection .",
    "for example , in models in which the extra dimensions are compact , it is possible that the compactification radius @xmath30 could be as large as @xmath2 m and thus would have not been seen in any experiment to date @xcite .",
    "these models would produce dramatic deviations from newtonian gravity at short distances since they imply that the @xmath31-dependence of the gravitational potential between point masses changes when the particle separation approaches @xmath30 : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the number of extra spatial dimensions , @xmath34 is the usual macroscopic newtonian gravitational constant , and @xmath35 is the more fundamental gravitational constant for the total @xmath36 dimensional spacetime .",
    "thus , in this model , newton s law of gravity is merely a projection of a more fundamental law of gravity onto 3 spatial dimensions , and the unusual weakness of gravity relative to the other fundamental forces is attributed to this projection .",
    "one of the striking features of some recent string models is that compactification can occur over scales much larger than the planck scale ( @xmath37  m)@xcite .",
    "for example , if in a @xmath36 dimensional spacetime the fundamental mass scale @xmath38 , where @xmath39  1  tev is the electroweak scale , then one expects the compactification scale @xmath30 to be given by @xcite @xmath40 which yields , @xmath41 since no deviations from newtonian gravity have been observed for @xmath42  m , theories which suggest that @xmath43  m ( e.g. , @xmath44 ) are compatible with current experimental limits .",
    "as one tests gravity over smaller distance scales , the effects of new extra dimensions would first appear as corrections to the usual gravitational potential .",
    "it has been shown that these corrections for @xmath45 have a yukawa form @xcite : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a composition - independent universal constant that depends on @xmath33 and the nature of the compactification , and the range of the interaction is @xmath48 , the compactification scale .",
    "for example , for @xmath33 extra dimensions compactified on an @xmath33-torus , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the first evidence supporting the existence of extra spatial dimensions ( and string theory ) could come from the detection of a composition - independent yukawa modification of newton s law of gravity .",
    "let us now turn to the current laboratory constraints on new yukawa forces which arise from a generic potential of the form , @xmath50 ( here we assume that the interactions are attractive for positive @xmath51 . )",
    "this potential will lead to a violation of the wep in a gravity experiment if @xmath51 is composition - dependent , as in the case of a vector or scalar interaction .",
    "in addition , even if @xmath51 is independent of the composition of the test masses , as in the case of the extra dimension theories described earlier , small violations of the wep will still be present in an experiment using different materials due to the `` finite - size '' effect @xcite .",
    "this effect arises because a non - uniform yukawa field will `` capture '' different fractions of two finite - sized objects having the same mass , but different densities , as will be the case in the null experiments considered below .",
    "finally , in addition to violating the wep , @xmath52 will also violate the isl , and so constraints on @xmath51 can be inferred from tests of the gravitational isl .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ yukawa constraints ] , the current experimental constraints on the yukawa coupling constant @xmath51 as a function of range @xmath53 are quite stringent ( allowed @xmath54 ) for @xmath2 m @xmath55  m , but they fall exponentially outside this region .",
    "composition - dependent experiments have set strong limits for specific couplings ( e.g. , to baryon number ) when @xmath56  m @xcite , but also fall off exponentially for @xmath57  m.     constraints on the coupling constant @xmath51 as a function of the range @xmath53 from composition - independent experiments @xcite .",
    "the dark shaded area indicates the region excluded as of 1981 , and the light hatched region gives the 1996 limits which remain current . ]    as discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , current constraints allow @xmath58 for @xmath57 m. for @xmath5 m @xmath59 m , these limits were obtained from a test of the gravitational isl by mitrofanov and ponomareva @xcite , but they still permit a new force with @xmath60 for @xmath61 m. however , a new round of gravity experiments @xcite should fill in much of this region of parameter space within the next few years . at shorter distances , casimir / van der waals forces dominate gravity so the current limits are set by casimir force experiments @xcite and are much less restrictive than those obtained from the longer ranged gravity experiments .",
    "[ see also refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions on extracting limits on new forces from casimir force experiments . ]",
    "the region @xmath62  m will remain essentially unexplored until the next generation of experiments specifically dedicated to search for new forces is designed and carried out .",
    "we turn next to a discussion of some of the difficulties likely to be encountered in developing this next round of experiments .",
    "as noted in the introduction , a number of authors @xcite have called attention to the huge gap in our understanding of gravity at very short distances , and to its potential to reveal new physics . the fact that short - distance gravity experiments can potentially expose the presence of extra spatial dimensions is particularly tantalizing . however , since @xmath63 in these string models , the ultimate experimental goal is quite challenging , namely to set limits @xmath64 for @xmath65 m. to accomplish this , one has to be able to sense and distinguish a force of gravitational strength at these distance scales . since the current laboratory limits in this region are orders of magnitude less sensitive than this goal , we discuss briefly some of the difficulties in studying gravity at short distances .",
    "an obvious problem is scaling @xcite .",
    "suppose we have two identical spheres of density @xmath66 and radius @xmath67 .",
    "if we wish to test the law of gravity between these spheres at short distances , the dimensions of the spheres have to be made comparable to the small distance scales that we are interested in probing .",
    "since the minimum separation distance between centers is @xmath68 , this leads to a maximum force @xmath69",
    "this example illustrates that the gravitational force between macroscopic objects , which is already quite small , decreases rapidly with size and separation of the test masses .",
    "a second problem in searching for new short - ranged forces is that their short range limits the effective mass of a body that can participate in the interaction .",
    "suppose we have a sphere of uniform density and radius @xmath67 .",
    "since gravity is a long - range force , another identical sphere close by will interact with all of the mass of the first sphere .",
    "however , if there exists a new force of range @xmath70 , then only the layer of material of thickness @xmath71 on the surface of the sphere will interact with external objects , and hence only a fraction @xmath72 of the total mass participates in interactions .",
    "but this problem is actually much worse in general .",
    "if we have two spheres nearly touching , it is only the mass within a range @xmath53 of the contact point that interacts , which is much less than the fraction @xmath73 , while the gravitational force is still felt by all the mass .",
    "therefore , even if the new force is intrinsically of gravitational strength ( @xmath74 ) between point masses when @xmath28 , this new force between macroscopic bodies will usually be much smaller than the corresponding gravitational force . this situation was not encountered in previous longer range gravity experiments since in those cases , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 was the characteristic size of the test bodies used .",
    "a third problem occurs when the separation distance is @xmath3 m , where intermolecular forces become significant .",
    "since these forces have a power - law form @xmath77 @xcite , where @xmath33 depends on the geometry of the macroscopic bodies , they grow very rapidly as @xmath31 decreases and overwhelm gravity at very short distances .",
    "distinguishing a force of gravitational strength from this background will be a major challenge .        to better appreciate how these problems might arise in actual experiments ,",
    "let us now consider a simple experimental setup .",
    "our goal here is to estimate the size of the various effects which might appear , and not to propose the optimal experimental design , and hence we will ignore practical problems which might be encountered when one actually attempts to realize such a design .",
    "since we are searching for forces of very short range , the discussion of the previous section suggests we should have most , if not all , of the mass of the two test bodies in an experiment contributing in order to realize the largest possible force .",
    "this means that we need to have all the mass in one body as close as possible to all the mass of the second body .",
    "the simplest way to accomplish this is to use parallel plates as our test bodies @xcite which maximizes the `` effective mass '' for any short - range range force .",
    "it then follows that the most appropriate configuration for searching for new forces between macroscopic bodies is a parallel - plate experiment analogous to those used to study the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "let us now consider two identical plates of density @xmath66 , thickness @xmath78 , area @xmath79 , separated by a distance @xmath80 ( figure [ plates ] ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath81 , we can then safely neglect edge effects and calculate the pressures between the plates as if @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the plates are perfectly smooth , perfectly conducting , and at temperature @xmath83 k.      we begin our investigation of the forces between these plates with the known forces , starting with gravity . for this particular configuration , the gravitational force acting on the plates is given by @xmath84 where the minus sign indicates an attractive force .",
    "we see that when the plates are sufficiently close , the gravitational attraction is constant , independent of the separation @xmath80 .",
    "if there are no stray charges , etc .",
    ", gravity is the dominant force at large plate separations , but as @xmath80 decreases , the casimir force grows rapidly and quickly overwhelms gravity . calculating the casimir force for this geometry for real metals can become quite complicated , involving corrections for finite conductivity and surface roughness @xcite .",
    "however , for present purposes we will ignore these difficulties by assuming the plates to be smooth and perfectly conducting over all frequencies , which should be a good approximation as long as the plates are not too close .",
    "however , we will include thermal effects which become large when the plate separation is large .",
    "the casimir force between our plates at temperature @xmath85 can be written as @xcite @xmath86   \\nonumber \\\\       &   & \\mbox { } - \\frac{\\pi^{2}(kt)^{4}l^{2}}{45(\\hbar c)^{3 } } , \\label{full f_c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is boltzmann s constant and factors of @xmath88 and @xmath89 have been included for convenience .",
    "( [ full f_c ] ) simplifies in the two limiting cases @xcite : @xmath90 having obtained expressions for the known forces acting between the plates in this idealized setup , let us now determine the forces arising from possible new interactions .",

    "( [ plate f_g ] ) is @xmath92 if @xmath93 , then @xmath94 thus , even if the yukawa coupling is intrinsically of gravitational strength ( @xmath95 ) , the actual yukawa force is suppressed relative to gravity not only by the usual exponential factor @xmath96 , but also by @xmath97 which arises because only a fraction @xmath98 of the total mass of each plate contributes to the yukawa force .",
    "this effect was discussed earlier and clearly illustrates how a short - ranged force intrinsically of gravitational strength is strongly suppressed in an experiment using macroscopic bodies .",
    "having found the general formulas for all the forces that we will be considering , let us now obtain numerical values for the following setup .",
    "we assume that the plates have dimensions @xmath99 , where @xmath100 cm and @xmath101 mm , which are roughly comparable to the values used in some of the current short distance gravity experiments @xcite . since our previous calculations assumed @xmath81 , we focus our attention on the region @xmath102",
    "m @xmath103",
    "m. next we will assume that the plates are made of pure copper which has a density @xmath104 kg / m@xmath105 .",
    "except for the new force parameters @xmath51 and @xmath53 , our problem is now completely specified .    using these numbers ,",
    "we first calculate the known forces , gravity and casimir , for the plates . as discussed earlier , the gravitational force under the conditions assumed here is constant and given by eq .",
    "( [ plate f_g ] ) . substituting the parameters given above yields @xmath106 to determine the casimir force for this configuration , we use eq .",
    "( [ full f_c ] ) .",
    "the cross - over distance @xmath107 , where temperature - dependent effects become important at @xmath83 k , is @xmath108 graphs of the casimir force using eq .",

    "the gravitational and casimir forces are equal to each other when @xmath83 k at @xmath109 m = 23 @xmath110 m , which just happens to coincide with @xmath107 here .",

    "( [ f_y ] ) yields @xmath115 exhibited in figure  [ parallel plate forces figure ] and table  [ forces table ] .",
    "we see that when @xmath116 , the force becomes constant : @xmath117 which is @xmath118 times smaller than the corresponding gravitational force given by eq .",
    "( [ plate gravity number ] ) .",
    "thus , as explained earlier , even though the yukawa force between _ point _ particles is of gravitational strength at short distances , @xmath114 is much smaller than gravity for these macroscopic plates .",
    "we also clearly see that @xmath119 is maximized when @xmath120 and falls off rapidly from this plate separation ( fig .",
    "[ force ratio figure ] ) .",
    "this is because @xmath114 levels off when @xmath121 while @xmath122 continues to increase via a power - law ( @xmath123 if @xmath124 ) .",
    "this analysis using an obviously idealized setup reveals the two critical problems that will be encountered in devising experiments using macroscopic bodies to search for very short - ranged yukawa interactions of gravitational strength ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the first is that the absolute magnitude of such a force will be very small , possibly even smaller than the gravitational force if @xmath51 is small .",
    "thus , an experiment must be sensitive to the smallest possible forces .",
    "second , since the casimir background force grows rapidly as the separation decreases , one must be able to extract the signal of a very weak force from a background of very strong intermolecular forces .",
    "a direct attack on this problem would be to attempt to calculate as accurately as possible the background forces in a gravity experiment , and to then subtract these from the observed force to set limits using what remains @xcite .",
    "however , recent experiments studying the casimir force reveal the difficulty of accurately calculating the background forces to better than 1% @xcite . while this approach is still possible",
    ", we will describe in the next section a new method of performing a null short - distance gravity experiment specifically designed to directly subtract out the unwanted background effects .",
    "calculating intermolecular forces precisely then becomes much less important .",
    "some of the best constraints on yukawa interactions come from tests of the wep @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "one compares the accelerations of compositionally - different test bodies toward a common source body .",
    "any differences in these accelerations can then be attributed to non - gravitational forces .",
    "we wish to utilize the same principle in a short - distance gravity experiment , and thus avail ourselves to the extreme sensitivity of such experiments .",
    "inspired by two ongoing short distance experiments @xcite , a possible design for one such experiment is shown in figure [ experiment 1 ] .",
    "it consists of two parallel plates , a source plate 1 and a detector plate made of two smaller plates 2 and @xmath126 .",
    "the source plate is driven sinusoidally with angular frequency @xmath127 such that the separation distance @xmath80 is given by @xmath128    instead of detecting a force , this experiment would be sensitive to a torque , modulated by the frequency @xmath127 , about an axis passing along the boundary where plates 2 and @xmath126 are joined , as shown in fig .  [",
    "experiment 1 ] .",

    "such calculations are difficult for real materials , but this certainly raises the hope that it is possible to choose appropriate plates 2 and @xmath126 such that @xmath151 at the very least , one should be able to fabricate the plates using two different isotopes of the same element ( e.g. , @xmath152 mg and @xmath153 mg ) such that eq .",
    "( [ f_c cancellation ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the underlying premise of the `` iso - electronic '' effect ( ie ) is that to a good approximation the casimir effect depends on the _ electronic _ properties of the materials , and hence is largely independent of their _ nuclear _ properties .",

    "thus , if plates 2 and @xmath126 have different densities , the effective mass seen by the yukawa force will be different and a net torque arises due to the `` finite - size '' effect discussed earlier .",
    "it is then clear that one should choose materials 2 and @xmath126 such that @xmath160 and @xmath161 differ as much as possible while still ensuring that the casimir torque vanishes . for the gold / copper and @xmath152mg/@xmath153 mg combinations suggested above , @xmath162",
    "the hope is that the suppression factor eq .",
    "( [ tau suppression ] ) is more than compensated by the reduction of the unwanted background torques .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly describing another possible design for a short distance null experiment motivated by another set of gravity experiments @xcite .",
    "as shown schematically in figure  [ experiment 2 ] , this experiment consists of two disks , one serving as the source mass , while the other ( detector mass ) is the pendant of a torsion pendulum . each disk is divided into alternating wedges made of two different materials 1 and 2 . the wedges and materials 1 and 2",
    "are designed such that no casimir torque would arise when the source disk rotates below the pendulum .",
    "for example , as indicated above , 1 and 2 might be gold / copper or @xmath152mg/@xmath153 mg which would significantly reduce the casimir torque . then ,",
    "if the separation between the disks is small , the remaining torque on the pendulum would arise from a putative yukawa force because the effective mass within a distance of @xmath53 will be different for alternating wedges .",
    "it is clear that there is significant motivation for testing newtonian gravity at very short distances .",
    "however , as we have seen , new problems will face experimentalists who wish to extend current constraints on the yukawa coupling constant @xmath51 down to ranges @xmath62 m. our aim in this paper has been to point out some of the most obvious difficulties , but there may be others that have passed unnoticed . while we have not addressed the significant issue of improving the sensitivity of experiments to very small forces , we have taken the first steps towards dealing with the problem of detecting small forces against a large intermolecular force background .",

    "it is hoped that experimentalists , who face the realities of imperfect materials and incomplete theories , can extract some useful ideas from these schematic designs or , perhaps , will be able to point to flaws which preclude them from working as actual experiments .",
    "finally , we conclude with the encouraging note that since so little is known about gravity at separations @xmath3 m , virtually _ any _ good experiment in this region will tell us something new .",
