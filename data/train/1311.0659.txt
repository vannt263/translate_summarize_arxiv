    "reflection a cooper pair ( virtually ) enters or leaves the qd , thereby mixing the even charge states of the qd . in the so - called superconducting atomic limit",
    "the abs can be expressed as a bcs - like superposition of an empty and a doubly occupied qd level , denoted as @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "the low energy excitation spectrum of a qd - s system is shown schematically in fig.[fig : es](a ) , where we chose the magnetic doublet to be the ground state ( gs ) and the abs to be the excited state ( es ) . a natural experiment to measure the andreev addition energy @xmath7 , defined as the energy difference between abs and magnetic doublet , uses a normal conducting tunnel probe ( n ) in a n - qd - s geometry .",
    "if the tunnel coupling between n and the qd , @xmath8 , is sufficiently weak , the influence of the tunnel probe on the qd - s excitation spectrum is negligible and the differential conductance across the device , @xmath9 , shows a peak for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this peak in differential conductance represents the onset of a current through the andreev channel when the electrochemical potential of the tunnel probe , @xmath11 , exceeds the addition energy , @xmath12 , as depicted in fig .",

    "this allows an electron to tunnel across the barrier @xmath8 and excite the qd , even in the presence of a large charging energy @xmath13 .",

    "the qd takes up a second electron at negative energy @xmath17 from n , which is equivalent to the emission of a hole with energy @xmath12 into n. the rate of this relaxation process is proportional to @xmath18 , the probability to find the qd empty so that an electron can be added to reach the @xmath19 state . a complete transport cycle , gs@xmath20es@xmath20gs , reflects an incoming electron as a hole and transfers a cooper pair to s with a probability proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "since the @xmath4state is a superposition of an empty and a doubly occupied qd level , the same es can be reached either by addition of an electron with positive energy @xmath12 to the gs , or by removal of an electron with negative energy @xmath17 from the gs .",

    "therefore local spectroscopy of abs is not able to investigate the excitation and relaxation process individually in a controlled manner .",
    "when a current is passed through the andreev channel the qd fluctuates between @xmath6 and @xmath4 . in each such fluctuation",
    "the qd state changes between even and odd occupation , which requires the addition or removal of a single electron to the qd . if only local processes are considered the s - contact can not drive such transitions because the electrons at energies below @xmath25 are paired and form a so - called bcs condensate . however , if a second qd is added to the qd - s system , higher order processes involving electrons from the second qd can deliver single electrons at sub - gap energies to one side of the superconductor .",

    "two qds ( qd1 and qd2 ) are connected to two normal conducting drains ( n1 and n2 ) and one common superconducting source .",
    "one possible process , in which the s - contact can excite qd1 , is elastic co - tunnelling : an electron at energy @xmath12 tunnels from qd2 to qd1 via a virtual quasiparticle state in s. another mechanism is crossed andreev reflection , also known as copper pair splitting ( cps ) : a cooper pair is coherently split into two electrons at opposite energies , here @xmath12 and @xmath17 , that leave s at different sites @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with similar device geometries demonstrated that the splitting of cooper pairs can be controlled by tuning the levels of the individual qds with local gates @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these experiments we are able to resolve individual abss on one of the qds .",
