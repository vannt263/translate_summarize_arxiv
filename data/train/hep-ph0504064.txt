    "the phenomena of spin rotation and spin dichroism ( birefringence effect ) for particles with the spin @xmath0 in an unpolarized medium were theoretically described for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of this phenomenon is in conversion of the vector polarization to the tensor one and vice versa ( similar the linear to circular polarization conversion for a photon in an optically anisotropic medium - the well known optical birefringence ) .",
    "however , unlike the optical birefringence , the birefringence effect for particles appear in isotropic matter ( and even the spin of matter nuclei is either zero or unpolarized ! ) .",
    "anisotropy is provided by the particle itself ( a particle with the spin @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 has the intrinsic anisotropy ) .",
    "deuteron spin dichroism was recently observed with the @xmath3 mev accelerator @xcite .",
    "further investigations of this phenomenon are planned to be carry out with a storage ring and an external beam @xcite .",
    "observation of particle spin rotation and spin dichroism ( the birefringence effect ) with a storage ring requires reducing of @xmath4 precession frequency ( @xmath5 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) .",
    "this precession appears due to interaction of the particle magnetic moment with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the requirement for @xmath4 precession cancellation also arises when searching for a deuteron electric dipole moment ( edm ) by the deuteron spin precession in an electric field in a storage ring@xcite .",
    "some extremely interesting ideas providing noticeable cancellation for @xmath4 precession are proposed in @xcite according to @xcite balancing the energy of the particle and the strength of the electric field in the storage ring provides to reduce and even zeroize the @xmath4 precession frequency . as a result",
    ", edm - caused spin rotation grows linearly with time @xcite .",
    "note that , when @xmath4 precession is suppressed , the angle of spin rotation induced by the birefringence effect grows linearly with time , too .",
    "the effect of deuteron ( nucleus ) birefringence in matter reveals itself in a storage ring due to presence of the residual gas inside the storage ring and use of a gas jet ( gas target ) for deuteron ( nucleus ) polarization analysis .",
    "moreover , birefringence also occurs in the solid target , which is used for analysis of polarization of the deuteron ( nucleus ) beam outside the storage ring .",
    "therefore , the phenomenon of birefringence in the gas medium and polarimeter would appear as a systematic error in the edm measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition , study of the birefringence phenomenon is of self - importance since it makes possible to measure the spin - depended part of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "lastly , the action of the electric field on the deuteron rouses one more mechanism of deuteron spin rotation and oscillations ( the phenomenon of birefringence in an electric field ) conditioned by the deuteron tensor electric polarizability @xcite .    in this paper several our preceding works concerning the birefringence effect in the nuclear pseudoelectric field of matter and an external electric field @xcite",
    "are summarized for a particle ( deuteron , nucleus ) moving in a storage ring .",
    "the attention is drawn to the additional possibility to measure the spin - dependent amplitude of the elastic coherent scattering of a deuteron by a nucleus , the electric polarizability of a deuteron ( nucleus ) .",
    "use of a gas target with polarized nuclei also allows to study p-,t - odd interactions .",
    "close connection between the coherent elastic scattering amplitude at zero angle @xmath6 and the refraction index of medium @xmath7 has been established as a result of numerous studies ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of particles per @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the wave number of a particle incident on a target .",
    "the expression ( [ refr_ind ] ) was derived in assumption that @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 then @xmath14 grows and expression for @xmath7 has the form @xmath15    let us consider particle refraction on the vacuum - medium boundary .",
    "the wave number of the particle in vacuum is denoted @xmath11 , @xmath16 is the wave number of the particle in the medium .",
    "= 5 cm    as it can be seen , the kinetic energy of a particle in vacuum @xmath17 is not equal to that in the medium @xmath18 .    from the energy conservation condition",
    "we immediately obtain the necessity to suppose that the particle in the medium possesses an effective potential energy ( see the detailed theory in @xcite . )",
    "this energy can be easily found from the evident equality @xmath19 i.e. @xmath20    above we considered the rest target . but in storage rings moving bunches can be used as a target .",
    "therefore we should generalize the expressions ( [ refr_ind],[u1 ] ) for this case .",
    "thus , let us consider the collision of two bunches of particles .",
    "suppose that in the rest frame of the storage ring the particles of the first beam have the energy @xmath21 and lorentz - factor @xmath22 , whereas particles of the second beam are characterized by the energy @xmath23 and lorentz - factor @xmath24 .",
    "let us recollect that the phase of a wave in a medium is lorentz - invariant .",
    "therefore , we can find it by the following way .",
    "let us choose the reference frame , where the second beam rests .",
    "as in this frame particles of the second beam rest , then the refraction index can be expressed in the conventional form ( [ refr_ind ] ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the density of the bunch 2 in its rest frame and @xmath27 is the density of the second bunch in the storage ring frame , @xmath28 is the wavenumber of particles of the first bunch in the rest frame of the bunch 2 .",
    "let us denote the length of the bunch 2 in its rest frame as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the length of this bunch in the storage ring frame .",
    "now we can find the change of the phase of the wave caused by the interaction of the particle 1 with the particles of bunch 2 : @xmath32    it is known that the ratio @xmath33 is invariant , so we can write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the amplitude of elastic coherent forward scattering of particle 1 by the moving particle 2 in the rest frame of the storage ring .    as a result @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the velocity of relative motion of the particle 1 and bunch 2 , if the first particle is nonrelativistic , whereas the second one is relativistic , then @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the speed of light , @xmath40 is the time of interaction of the particle 1 with the bunch 2 in the rest frame of the storage ring .    the particle with the velocity @xmath41 passes the distance @xmath42 over the time @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that the path length @xmath43 differs from the length of bunch 2 , because it moves",
    ". expression ( [ phase1 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath44 where the index of refraction of the particle 1 by the beam of moving particles 2 is : @xmath45 if @xmath46 , the the conventional expression ( 1 ) follows from ( [ r_ind_z ] )    so , let us consider particles captured to a trap .",
    "they are nonrelativistic . from ( [ u1 ] )",
    "the effective potential energy @xmath47 can be expressed as : @xmath48 where @xmath24 is the lorentz - factor of the bunch 2 and the lorentz - factor of the particle 1 is @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that the amplitude of coherent elastic scattering at zero angle depends on the t - matrix as follows : @xmath51 i.e. the amplitude of forward scattering is proportional to the lorentz - factor @xmath24 . as a result , the quantity @xmath52 depends on the energy of the particle only due to possible dependence of t - matrix on energy . from ( [",
    "u_],[t - matrix ] ) one can obtain @xmath53",
    "let us consider the refraction of a particle with the spin @xmath54 in matter .",
    "according to @xcite the index of refraction for such a particle depends on the particle spin and can be written as :    @xmath55    where@xmath56 , @xmath9  is the density of matter ( the number of scatterers in 1 @xmath57 ) , @xmath11  is the deuteron wave number , @xmath58  is the spin density matrix of the scatterers , @xmath59  is the operator of the forward scattering amplitude , acting in the combined spin space of the particle and scatterer spin @xmath60 .    for a particle with the spin @xmath61 ( for example , deuteron ) in an unpolarized target @xmath62",
    "can be written as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the deuteron spin operator , @xmath65 is the unit vector along the deuteron momentum @xmath66 .",
    "the axis of quantization _ z _ is directed along the particle wave vector @xmath67 . considering only strong interactions , which are invariant to the parity transformation and time reversal",
    ", we may omit the terms containing @xmath68 in odd degrees .",
    "therefore , the refractive index for deuterons @xmath69 depends on the deuteron spin orientation relative to the deuteron momentum .",
    "the refractive index for a particle in the state , which is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath70 of spin projection on the axis @xmath43 : @xmath71 @xmath72 is the magnetic quantum number .    according to eq.([hatn3 ] ) , the refractive indices for the states with @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the same , while those for @xmath75 and @xmath76 are different ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "this can be obviously explained as follows ( see fig.[sigma ] ) : the shape of a deuteron in the ground state is non  spherical .",
    "therefore , the scattering cross - section @xmath79 for a deuteron with @xmath80 ( deuteron spin is parallel to its momentum @xmath66 ) differs from the scattering cross - section @xmath81 for a deuteron with @xmath76 : @xmath82 according to the dispersion relation @xmath83 , then @xmath84 .",
    "= 5 cm    from the above it follows that deuteron spin dichroism appears even when the deuteron passes through an unpolarized target : due to different absorption , the initially unpolarized beam acquires polarization or , yet more precisely , alignment .",
    "let us consider the behavior of the deuteron spin in a target .",
    "the spin state of the deuteron is described by its vector and tensor polarization ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , here @xmath87 .",
    "when the deuteron moves in matter its vector and tensor polarization appears changed . to calculate @xmath88 and @xmath89 one need to know the explicit form of the deuteron spin wave function @xmath90    the wave function of the deuteron that has passed the distance @xmath43 inside the target is : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the wave function of the deuteron before entering the target .",
    "the wave function @xmath90 can be expressed as a superposition of the basic spin functions @xmath93 , which are the eigenfunctions of the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 therefore , @xmath98 ( according to the above @xmath99 ) .",
    "suppose plane @xmath100 coincides with the plane formed by the initial deuteron vector polarization @xmath101 and the momentum @xmath66 of the deuteron . in this case @xmath102 , and",
    "the components of the polarization vector at @xmath103 are @xmath104 .",
    "the components of the vector polarization @xmath105 inside the target are : + @xmath106 similarly , the components of the tensor polarization @xmath107 are expressed as : + @xmath108 + where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .    according to ( [ rot1 ] ) , ( [ rot2 ] ) spin rotation",
    "occurs when the angle between the polarization vector @xmath114 and momentum @xmath66 of the particle differs from @xmath115 .",
    "for example , when @xmath116 , the angle between the polarization vector and momentum is acute ( see fig.[angle1 ] ) and the spin rotates left - hand around the momentum direction , whereas an obtuse angle between the polarization vector and the momentum gives rise to right - hand spin rotation ( see fig.[angle2 ] ) .",
    "= 5 cm    = 5 cm    when the polarization vector and momentum are perpendicular ( a transversely polarized particle ) , then the components of the vector polarization at @xmath103 are : @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 . in this case @xmath120 and dependance of the vector polarization on @xmath43 can be expressed as : @xmath121 according to ( [ 11 ] ) the vector and tensor polarization oscillate when a transversely polarized deuteron passes through matter ( see fig.[oscillate ] ) i.e. the vector polarization converts to the tensor one and vice versa ( similar the linear to circular polarization conversion for a photon in an optically anisotropic medium - the well known optical birefringence ) .",
    "however , unlike the optical birefringence , the birefringence effect for particles appear in isotropic matter ( and even the spin of matter nuclei is either zero or unpolarized ! ) .",
    "anisotropy is provided by the particle itself ( a particle with the spin @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 has the intrinsic anisotropy ) .",
    "= 5 cm    according to the above ( see ( [ u1 ] ) ) a particle possesses some effective potential energy @xmath47 in matter .",
    "if the particle spin @xmath122 , then this energy depends on the spin orientation @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the particle mass , @xmath125 is the spin dependent zero - angle elastic coherent scattering amplitude of the particle , @xmath7 is the density of the scatterers in the medium ( the number of scatterers in @xmath126 ) , @xmath127 is the lorentz factor . substituting @xmath125 for a particle with the spin @xmath61 in ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "in the explicit form one can obtain @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath65 is the unit vector along the particle momentum direction .",
    "let the quantization axis z is directed along @xmath65 and @xmath72 denotes the magnetic quantum number .",
    "then , for a particle in a state that is an eigenstate of the operator @xmath129 of spin projection onto the z - axis , the effective potential energy can be written as : @xmath130 according to ( [ 1.3 ] ) splitting of the deuteron energy levels in matter is similar to splitting of atom energy levels in an electric field aroused from the quadratic stark effect .",
    "therefore , the above effect could be considered as caused by splitting of the spin levels of the particle in the pseudoelectric nuclear field of matter .",
    "let an electric field acts on a deuteron ( nucleus ) .",
    "the energy @xmath131 of the deuteron beam in the external electric field @xmath132 due to the tensor electric polarizability can be written in the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the deuteron tensor electric polarizability , @xmath135 are the components of the electric field .",
    "this expression can be rewritten as follows : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the deuteron scalar electric polarizability , @xmath138 is the deuteron tensor electric polarizability , @xmath139 is the unit vector along @xmath132 .",
    "comparison of ( [ 1.5 ] ) with ( [ 1.2 ] ) provides to conclude that in an electric field we can observe the effect of spin rotation and oscillations about the @xmath132 direction for a particle with @xmath122 , too @xcite .",

    "thus , the changes in the deuteron vector and tensor polarization are the result of several mechanisms :    - rotation of the spin in the horizontal plane @xmath222 ( fig.[fig.4 ] ) .",

    "* moreover , the spin dichroism leads to the appearance of the tensor polarization .",
    "let us compare the frequency and the angle of polarization vector rotation caused by the edm with those caused by the birefringence effect .",
    "\\1 . the spin rotation frequency caused by the edm",
    "is determined by the formula ( [ 2.3 ] ) @xmath230 we can get @xmath231 for the storage ring with @xmath232 , @xmath233 and expected value of the deuteron edm @xmath234 and @xmath235 for edm @xmath236 .    \\2 . the spin rotation frequency caused by the phenomena of birefringence in a residual gas : @xmath237 using the last formula one can get @xmath238 for @xmath239 ( suppose the pressure inside the storage ring @xmath240 torr ) , @xmath241 .",
    "this effect depends on the density @xmath7 ( depends on the pressure inside the storage ring ) .",
    "\\3 . the spin rotation frequency caused by the phenomenon of birefringence in the gas jet ( gas target ) , which is used for the beam extraction to the polarimeter @xcite ( fig.[polarimeter ] ) :    = 8 cm    in this case the effective rotation frequency ( or the rotation angle for @xmath242 )",
    "is determined as follows : @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the effective frequency of spin rotation , @xmath245 is the deuteron spin rotation angle for @xmath242 , @xmath246 is the density of the target , @xmath31 is the length of the target , @xmath247 is the frequency of beam rotation in the storage ring , @xmath248 is the deuteron wave number .",
    "really , the frequency @xmath249 of the spin rotation in matter is @xmath250 the spin rotation angle @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the deuteron flying time in the target .",
    "the angle of rotation at 1 second is @xmath253 ( during a second the deuteron passes through the gas target @xmath247 times ) . as a result , @xmath254 so one can get @xmath255 where @xmath256 . then using the experimental parameters @xcite @xmath257 , @xmath258 we have @xmath259 .",
    "so the angle of polarization vector rotation for @xmath242 caused by the phenomenon of birefringence in the gas jet of polarimeter appears by two orders of magnitude greater than the angle of rotation due to the edm . the additional contribution to spin rotation",
    "is also provided by the solid carbon target of polarimeter ( see figure.[polarimeter ] ) .",
    "the estimation for the spin rotation frequency caused by the birefringence in an electric field according to ( [ 2.30 ] ) for @xmath260 and @xmath261 is @xmath262 .",
    "let us estimate the value of spin dichroism .",
    "this characteristic is given by the parameter @xmath263 ( see expressions ( [ 2.25 ] ) , ( [ 2.26 ] ) ) :    - in the case of the scattering by the residual gas we have @xmath264 for @xmath265 @xmath266 ;    - if a deuteron passes through the gas jet ( gas target ) for @xmath267s is @xmath268 then for @xmath257 and @xmath269 one can get @xmath270 .",
    "so we can conclude that there is the significant beam spin dichroism .",
    "it should be especially mentioned that the polarimeter ( fig.[polarimeter ] ) includes a solid target .",
    "therefore , the birefringence effect in the matter of the solid target arises , too .    the possible influence of p - odd spin rotation and spin dichroism ( i.e. different absorbtion cross - sections in matter for a deuteron with the spin parallel and antiparallel to the momentum @xmath271 ) are nt to be forgotten .",
    "the above analysis shows that the phenomena of deuteron birefringence in matter and an electric field should be studied in experiments for the edm search with a storage ring .",
    "moreover , they could imitate the spin rotation due to the edm .",
    "study of the birefringence effects in such experiments could provide to measure both the spin - dependent part @xmath272 of the amplitude of the coherent elastic scattering of a deuteron by a nucleus at the zero angle and the tensor electric polarizability of a deuteron .",
    "it should be also mentioned that if the nuclei in the gas jet are polarized , then according to @xcite the p-,t - odd spin rotation and dichroism appear in the storage ring .",
    "they are caused by the t - odd nucleon - nucleon interaction of a deuteron with a polarized nucleus and , in particular , interaction described by @xmath273 $ ] , where @xmath274 is the polarization vector of gas target .",
    "p - even t - odd spin rotation and dichroism of deuterons ( nuclei ) caused by the interaction either @xmath275)(\\vec{s}\\vec{n})$ ] or @xmath276 \\vec{j } ) ( \\vec{j } \\vec{n})]$ ] also could be observed @xcite ( here @xmath277 is the spin of the polarized target nuclei , @xmath278 is the spin matrix density of the target nuclei ) .",
    "let us consider the amplitude of deuteron scattering by a proton depending on spin orientation with respect to the deuteron momentum @xcite .    for fast deuterons",
    "the scattering amplitude can be found in the eikonal approximation @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the amplitude of zero - angle coherent scattering in this approximation can be written as follows : @xmath279 where @xmath11 is the deuteron wavenumber , @xmath280 is the impact parameter , i.e. the distance between the deuteron and the proton centers of gravity in the normal plane ; @xmath281 is the wavefunction of the deuteron in the ground state ; @xmath282 is the probability to find proton and neutron ( in the deuteron ) at the distance @xmath283 apart .",
    "the phase shift due to the deuteron scattering by a proton is @xmath284 @xmath285 is the @xmath283 component perpendicular to the momentum of the incident deuteron , @xmath171 is the deuteron velocity .",
    "the phase shift @xmath286 , where @xmath287 and @xmath288 are the phase shifts caused by proton - proton and neutron - proton interactions , respectively .    for the polarized deuteron under consideration",
    "the probability @xmath289 is different for the different spin states of the deuteron .",
    "thus for states with the magnetic quantum number @xmath290 , the probability is @xmath291 , whereas for @xmath76 , it is @xmath292 . owing to the additivity of the phase shifts , the equation ( [ amp ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath293 where @xmath294    attention should be given to the fact that the latter expression is valid if one neglects spin dependence of nuclear forces between the colliding proton ( neutron ) and proton . when this dependence is taken into account",
    ", the phase shift @xmath295 is an operator acting in the spin space of colliding particles and in the general case the expansion ( [ 42 ] ) is not valid .",
    "however , to estimate the magnitude of the effect of deuteron spin oscillations , spin dependence of nuclear forces may be neglected ( spin dependent contribution was considered in @xcite ) .",
    "let us also omit terms caused by the coulomb interaction . from ( [ 42 ] )",
    "it follows @xmath296 where @xmath297 and @xmath298 is the amplitude of the proton ( neutron)-proton zero - angle elastic coherent scattering .",
