    "there is a growing interest in the relation between the fast vibrational dynamics and the long - time structural relaxation occurring in viscous systems and supercooled liquids close to their glass transition @xcite .",
    "this resulted in studies of the vibrational dynamics of both glasses @xcite and fluid systems @xcite .",
    "recently , the universal correlation between the amplitude of the caged dynamics , as expressed by the debye - waller factor ( dw ) , and the structural relaxation time @xmath0 has been evidenced by simulations and experiments on several physical systems including molecular liquids , polymers and metallic alloys in a wide range of fragility @xcite .",
    "it was found that the shape of the related scaling function is also controlled by the non - gaussianity of the kinetic unit displacement @xcite .",
    "the present paper provides further insight on that issues by presenting new numerical results .",
    "the glass transition has been pictured as the freezing of a liquid in an aperiodic crystal structure ( acs ) where the viscous flow is due to activated jumps over energy barriers @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the displacement to overcome the barrier and @xmath9 is the dw factor of the liquid , i.e. the amplitude of the rattling motion within the cage of the nearest neighbours atoms @xcite .",
    "the acs picture leads to the hall - wolynes ( hw ) equation , @xmath10 , a relation which has been derived by others too @xcite .",
    "the hw equation relies on the condition that @xmath0 exceeds the vibrational time scales .",
    "when the hw equation is compared with the experiments , one notes strong deviations from the predicted linear dependence between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . to generalize the hw equation ,",
    "one considers a distribution @xmath13 of the square displacement to overcome the energy barriers @xcite .",
    "following the central limit theorem , the gaussian form is adopted , @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 is the normalization constant , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the average and the standard deviation respectively .",
    "note that , since @xmath18 , this choice corresponds to a gaussian distribution of energy barriers .",
    "the distribution is taken to be independent of the state parameters because the average displacement of the kinetic unit within @xmath0 is weakly dependent on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dw factor depends on the state parameters @xcite . if one averages the hw expression over @xmath13 , one obtains the following generalized hw expression ( ghw ) : @xmath19 eq .",
    "[ parabola ] neglects the very weak dw - dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "if the linear temperature dependence of the dw factor is assumed , ghw reduces to other results reported for supercooled liquids @xcite , polymers @xcite or models of glassy relaxation @xcite .",
    "a coarse - grained model of a linear freely - jointed polymer is used . non - bonded monomers interact via a generalized lennard - jones pair potential @xmath21 with @xmath22   + u_{cut}$ ] with @xmath23 . the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 control the stiffness of the attractive and the repulsive part , respectively .",
    "all quantities are in reduced units : length in units of @xmath26 , temperature in units of @xmath27 , and time in units of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the monomer mass and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "the energy unit is given by the depth of the potential well @xmath31 .",
    "we also set @xmath32 .",
    "the potential is cut and shifted to zero by @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "the potential @xmath21 reduces to the usual lennard - jones ( lj ) potential by setting @xmath35 .",
    "bonded monomers interact with a potential which is the sum of the fene ( finitely extendible nonlinear elastic ) potential and the lj potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "this results in a bond length @xmath36 .",
    "samples with @xmath37 monomers were used .",
    "equilibration runs were performed in isothermal - isobaric ( npt ) or canonical ( ntv ) ensembles .",
    "data were collected under microcanonical conditions by integrating the equations of motion with a reversible multiple time steps algorithm , i.e. the r - respa algorithm @xcite .",
    "physical states with different values of the temperature @xmath38 , the density @xmath39 , the chain length @xmath40 and the monomer - monomer interaction potential @xmath21 were studied .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "in this section the translational dynamics and the relaxation of the monomeric unit are studied . changing the state parameters @xmath41 results in changes of both the dw factor and the relaxation time @xmath0 .",
    "it was found that , when different physical states have the same relaxation time , both their translational dynamics , as expressed by the mean square displacement ( msd ) , and their relaxation , as expressed by the self part of the intermediate scattering function ( isf ) , are coincident from the ballistic regime up to the onset of the connectivity effects ( rouse regime ) at times fairly longer than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the resulting clusters of curves are shown in fig.[fig1 ] for both msd ( @xmath42 ) and isf ( @xmath43 \\rangle $ ] , @xmath44 refers to the maximum of the static structure factor ) . `",
    "[ insert figure 1 about here ] ' fig.[fig1 ] also shows the definition of @xmath0 via the equation @xmath45 .",
    "the existence of clusters of physical states with similar dynamics over the wide time range from the vibrational regime to the long - time relaxation suggests that the latter are correlated . to investigate this issue ,",
    "it was noted that the location of the inflection point of the msd does not depend on the state point , i.e. it always occurs at the same time @xmath46 in the log - log plot of msd @xcite .",
    "this gives the opportunity of a clear - cut definition of the dw factor as @xmath47 .",
    "the plot of @xmath0 vs @xmath48 leads to a master curve for the numerical results well described by the ghw eq.[parabola ] which fits the experimental results over about eighteen orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we investigated if , in addition to msd and isf , other quantities exhibit identical time - dependence when evaluated for the clusters of states with identical @xmath0 values shown in fig.[fig1 ] . the results for the non - gaussian parameter ( ngf ) @xmath49 , which quantifies the dynamical heterogeneity of the system at a given time @xmath50 @xcite , are shown in fig.[fig2 ] . `",
    "[ insert figure 2 about here ] ' ngf vanishes if the monomer displacement is a gaussian process .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows that ngf increases between the end of the ballistic regime ( @xmath51 ) and roughly @xmath0 .",
    "it is apparent that , within the statistical uncertainty , physical states with coincident msd and isf ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) have equal ngf up to about @xmath0 too . for longer times",
    "the ngf of physical states with equal @xmath0 but different chain length differ also due to the onset of connectivity effects ( rouse regime ) @xcite .",
    "it has been already shown that the magnitude of the non - gaussian parameter is related to the curvature of the ghw eq.[parabola ] when the plot @xmath11 vs @xmath52 is considered @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the quadratic and the linear terms of eq.[parabola ] with respect to @xmath52 , @xmath53 increases with the height of ngf @xmath54 and , if the latter vanishes , @xmath55 does the same @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig.[fig2 ] shows the increase of @xmath56 by increasing @xmath0 .",
    "if the non - gaussian effects are missing , isf reduces to @xmath57 .",
    "the first correction to @xmath58 due to the non - gaussian effects depends on ngf and reads @xcite : @xmath59 .",
    "\\label{eq : isfxngf}\\ ] ] ` [ insert figure 3 about here ] ' fig.[fig3 ] compares the numerical results for isf with the approximation @xmath60 .",
    "it is seen that , when @xmath61 , @xmath60 poorly approximates the numerical results , thus showing that the non - gaussian effects on the relaxation are not accounted for by the first correction to @xmath62 , i.e. they are not small .",
    "however , in spite of the large deviations of @xmath60 from the exact results , the inset of fig.[fig3 ] shows that the relative error between @xmath0 and the approximated estimate @xmath63 ( to be defined by the equation @xmath64 ) is reasonable .",
    "the correlations between the fast dynamics of the monomers within the cage of the first neighbours and the long - time structural relaxation are studied .",
    "it is shown that physical states with equal @xmath0 exhibit coincident msd , isf and ngf from the ballistic regime up to the onset of the connectivity effects ( rouse regime ) at times fairly longer than @xmath0 .",
    "the first correction to the gaussian approximation of isf disagrees from the numerical results for @xmath61 .",
    "however , the relative error between @xmath0 and the approximated estimate @xmath65 stays within reasonable bounds .",
