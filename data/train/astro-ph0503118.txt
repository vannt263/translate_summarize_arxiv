    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is now a well known probe of the early universe .",
    "the temperature fluctuations in the cmb , especially the so - called acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , capture the physics of primordial photon - baryon fluid undergoing oscillations in the potential wells of dark matter ( hu et al .",

    " are both simple and linear , and many aspects of it have been discussed in the literature since the early 1970s ( peebles & yu 1970 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) . the gravitational redshift contribution at large angular scales ( e.g. , sachs & wolfe 1968 ) and the photon - diffusion damping at small angular scales ( e.g. , silk 1968 ) complete this description .    by now , the structure of the first few acoustic peaks is well studied with nasa s wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) mission ( e.g. , spergel et al .",

    "given the improved resolution and better frequency coverage , a variety of studies related to secondary anisotropies , e.g. , sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ; cooray , hu & tegmark 2000 ) is expected . beyond temperature fluctuations , detections of the polarization anisotropy , related to density or scalar perturbations , have now been made by dasi ( kovac et al .",

    "2004 ) and cbi ( readhead et al . 2004",
    "; cartwright et al . 2005 ) , while the temperature - polarization power spectrum is measured by wmap ( kogut et al . 2003 ) .",
    "an interesting result from wmap data is related to the very large ( @xmath2 ) angular scale polarization signal , which probes the local universe and associated astrophysics instead of physics at the last scattering surface probed with polarization at tens of arcminute scales .",
    "this local universe contribution arises when the universe reionizes again and the temperature quadrupole begins to rescatter to produce a new contribution to the polarization anisotropy at angular scales corresponding to the horizon at the new scattering surface ( zaldarriaga 1997 ) .",
    "the large - scale excess signal measured in the wmap temperature - polarization cross - correlation power spectrum is interpreted as rescattering with an optical depth to electron scattering of @xmath3 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "such an optical depth suggests early reionization ; for example , if the universe reionized completely and instantaneously at some redshift , the measured optical depth suggests a reionization redshift of @xmath1 17 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "such a high optical depth , in the presence of a @xmath5 1% neutral hydrogen fraction from z @xmath1 6 sloan quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggests a complex reionization history .",
    "a complex , and patchy , reionization , however , is expected if the reionization is dominated by the uv light from first luminous objects , though to explain the high level of the wmap s optical depth requires high star formation efficiency at redshifts of order 15 with a possibility for a population of metal - free massive pop iii stars ( e.g. , cen 2003 ) .    in general",
    ", one can only extract limited information related to the reionization history from polarization peak at tens of degrees or more angular scales ( e.g. , hu & holder 2003 ) . one reason for this is the large cosmic variance associated with measurements at multipoles of @xmath1 10 . to extract detailed information of the reionization process",
    ", one can move to temperature fluctuations generated during the reionization era at angular scales corresponding to few arcminutes and below . at these small angular scales ,",
    "potentially interesting contributions from high redshifts include a scattering contribution related to moving electrons in ionized patches and fluctuations in the moving electron population ( e.g. , santos et al .",

    "we first summarize basic aspects related to inflation under the assumption of a single scalar field model .",
    "our derivations , however , are applicable to multi - field theories with few alterations ( lidsey et al . 1997 ) . in general ,",
    "constraints on inflation are obtained by comparing theoretically calculated scalar and tensor metric  gravitational waves  perturbations to direct ( in the case of space - based detectors ) and indirect ( such as cmb ) measurements of these perturbations .",
    "the tensor and scalar perturbations are determined by the evolution of the scalar field , @xmath7 , ( the inflaton field ) and the scale factor , @xmath8 , with time .",
    "the equation of motion for a scalar field with a self - interaction potential , @xmath9 , is given by , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and the prime refers to differentiation with respect to the field , @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of the hubble parameter is determined by the energy density , @xmath12 , which we suppose is dominated by the energy density associated with the inflaton field , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the initial curvature redshifts away by the time the scales corresponding to the current hubble horizon left the inflationary horizon .",
    "in general , an exact analytic solution for the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations does not exist . in order to facilitate analytic solutions ,",
    "one generally resorts to the slow - roll expansion , where the equations of motion are expanded in terms of the inflaton potential and its derivatives ( liddle , parsons & barrow 1994 ) .",
    "motivation for this expansion can be understood by noting that the equation of motion for the inflaton field is formally equivalent to the equation of motion of a mass moving under a potential @xmath15 with damping due to the cosmological expansion .",
    "the slow roll expansion supposes that the motion of the field reaches a terminal velocity in which the potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy and the acceleration of the field is negligible . in order to quantify these assumptions , the slow - roll parameters are used @xmath16 under the assumption that @xmath17 , the approximate slow - roll evolution equations are @xmath18 on a given length scale , scalar perturbations start as quantum fluctuations in otherwise classical fields well within the horizon . here , flat space - time quantum field theory is appropriate .",
    "as the scale factor quasi - exponentially increases , the length scale is stretched beyond the inflationary horizon .",
    "the quantum fluctuations are then amplified and become classical perturbations to the metric ( guth & pi 1982 ) . in order to study scalar and tensor perturbations ,",
    "we consider their power spectra .",
    "it can be shown that within the slow roll approximation the amplitude of power spectra can be written as ( stewart & lyth 1993 , lidsey et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 refer to scalar and tensor perturbations respectively .",
    "the right hand sides of the above equations are to be evaluated when a given comoving length scale crosses the inflationary horizon with @xmath22 . in order to quantify how these power spectra change with scale",
    ", one considers their power - law spectral indices ( liddle and lyth 1992 ) , @xmath23 if the potential is flat enough , higher order spectral parameters , which are higher order in the slow roll parametersm , can be ignored ( stewart & lyth 1993 ) . as long as the slow roll parameters can be considered constant ,",
    "we are able to write the power spectra as power - laws with spectral indices given by the above expressions .",
    "it can then be shown that , @xmath24 currently , cmb data probe up to @xmath25 corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "current observations constrain @xmath27 at scales corresponding to the current hubble horizon . therefore , although cmb observations do cover a few orders of magnitude in wavenumber , to within second order in the slow roll parameters , they can be considered constant over the range probed by the cmb .",
    "this implies that the perturbation power spectra will appear as approximate power laws , expanded around some pivot wavenumber , @xmath28 ( leach et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath29 in the case of wmap these parameters are evaluated at @xmath30 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; peiris et al .",
    "2003 ) . using the expressions for the amplitudes and spectral indices in terms of the slow roll parameters , we are able to solve for the potential and its first two derivatives and thereby use observations to constrain the form that this potential can take .",
    "we have , @xmath31 and all of the spectral parameters are to be evaluated at the pivot wavenumber , @xmath28 .",
    "the last expression is known as the consistency relation and is true only in single - field inflationary model .",
    "the expression relaxes to an inequality in the case of multi - field models .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that both scalar and tensor spectra are determined from the dynamics of a single scalar field , so they are not independent ( lidsey et al .",
    "1997 , liddle & lyth 2000 ) .      though acoustic oscillations in the temperature anisotropies of cmb suggest an inflationary origin for primordial perturbations , such as in the wmap data ( peiris et al .",
    "2003 ) , it has been argued for a while that the smoking - gun signature for inflation would be the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( e.g. , kamionkowski & kosowsky 1999 ) . since cmb probes horizon to super - horizon scales , inflation is the only known mechanism to casually produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves at such large wavelengths ( e.g. , starobinsky 1979 ) . note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave background is highly unknown . since the amplitude of these inflationary gravitational waves is proportional to @xmath32 , the value of the inflaton potential @xmath9 during inflation , the amplitude of gravitational - wave induced b - mode polarization anisotropies directly constrains the energy scale of inflation @xmath33 . relative to cobe normalization , the relation between the energy scale and the ratio of tensor - to - scalar fluctuations is @xmath34 ( turner & white 1996 ) , the current limit from cmb anisotropy data , based on large angular - scale cmb temperature fluctuations , suggests an upper limit of order @xmath35 gev ( melchiorri & odman 2003 ) .    instead of temperature fluctuations ( where dominant scalar perturbations confuse the detection of tensor contribution )",
    ", the gravitational - waves can be studied through their distinct signature in the cmb polarization in the form of a contribution to the curl , or magnetic - like , component ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1997 ; seljak & zaldarriaga 1997 ) .",
    "there is no contribution from the dominant scalar , or density - perturbation , contribution to these curl modes in linear theory .",
    "secondary effects related to density perturbations , however , do produce signals in the curl - mode and confuse the detection of inflationary gravitational - wave signal .    among these ,",
    "the few percent conversion of e to b from cosmic shear modification to the polarization pattern by the intervening large scale structure is important ( zaldarriaga & seljak 1998 ) .",
    "these lensing - induced curl modes introduce a noise from which gravitational waves must be distinguished in the cmb polarization .",
    "gravitational lensing of the cmb photons by the mass fluctuations in the large - scale structure is now well understood ( e.g. , hu 2000 ; hu & cooray 2001 ) . the lensing effect can be described through a remapping process involving angular deflections resulting along the photon path : @xmath36 where the deflection angle on the sky is given by the angular gradient of the lensing potential , @xmath37 , which itself is a projection of the gravitational potential , @xmath38 ( see e.g. kaiser 1992 ) , @xmath39 the quantities here are the conformal distance or lookback time , from the observer ( @xmath40 ) and the analogous angular diameter distance @xmath41 .",
    "the lensing potential in equation  ( 16 ) can be related to the well known convergence generally encountered in conventional lensing studies involving galaxy shear ( kaiser 1992 ) @xmath42 where note that the 2d laplacian operating on @xmath38 is a spatial and not an angular laplacian .",
    "expanding the lensing potential to fourier moments , @xmath43 we can write the usually familiar quantities of convergence and shear components of weak lensing as @xmath44 taking the fourier transform , as appropriate for a flat - sky , we write @xmath45 where @xmath46    the lensed power spectrum , according to the present formulation , is discussed in hu ( 2000 ) and we can write @xmath47    \\ ,                                  c_l^{\\theta}+ { \\int { d^2 { \\bf l}_1 \\over ( 2\\pi)^2 } } c_{| { { \\bf l}}- { { \\bf l}}_1|}^{\\theta}c^{\\phi\\phi}_{l_1 }                  [ ( { { \\bf l}}- { { \\bf l}}_1)\\cdot { { \\bf l}}_1]^2   \\ , . \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{eqn : ttflat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the lensing effect involves the angular gradient of cmb photons and leaves the surface brightness unaffected , its signatures are at the second order in temperature . effectively , lensing smoothes the acoustic peak structure at large angular scales and moves photons to small scales .",
    "note that the approach above treats the deflection angle as a perturbative parameter .",
    "such an approximation breaks down at angular scales corresponding to roughly the rms deflection angle of a cmb photon ( @xmath1 a few arcminutes ) .",
    "while the approach can be extended to higher order ( e.g. , cooray 2004c ) , the numerical calculation becomes increasingly time consuming .",

    "while this is encouraging , it is useful to consider alternative techniques to reduce the confusion .",
    "a useful way to estimate @xmath62 , but out to a high - redshift , is by observing the weak - lensing distortions of the shapes of objects of a known average shape at redshift @xmath64 . as the cmb source redshift is at @xmath65 , observations of the weak lensing of galaxies , out to a redshift of @xmath66@xmath67 ,",
    "can not be used to effectively delens cmb maps because a large fraction of the lensing contamination ( 55% at @xmath68 ) comes from structure at @xmath69 .",
    "a possibility exists in the form anisotropies in the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations during the era and prior to reionization ( sigurdson & cooray 2005 ) .",
    "for example , using a quadratic reconstruction of the deflection field of 21 cm anisotropies out to a source redshift of 30 , in conjunction with a low - resolution but high signal - to - noise cmb polarization experiment , could detect @xmath70 or @xmath71  gev if 21 cm fluctuations measurements are limited to @xmath72 .",
    "if the resolution in 21 cm observations is improved so that one can measure 21 cm brightness temperature anisotropy spectrum out to @xmath73 , one can improve down to @xmath74 or @xmath75  gev .",
    "this limit is comparable to using cmb lensing information alone from high sensitive maps at 2 arcminute resolution ( seljak & hirata 2004 ) .",
    "to achieve such a resolution one requires roughly a space mission with an aperture of diameter @xmath76 meters . in the case of cmb lens - cleaning with information from 21 cm observations , as the igw signal is at multipoles of 100 ( in the case of recombination bump ) and/or 20 ( in the case of reionization with optical depths around 0.1 ) , the cmb data need not be high resolution . since lensing information is not extracted from cmb observations , the optimal observing strategy is to integrate over a few square degree patch of the sky as proposed in kamionkowski & kosowsky ( 1998 ) .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that the inflationary probe of nasa s beyond einstein program can be designed in combination with a cosmic 21-cm radiation experiment .",

    "the cmb detection and the detection of the laser interferometers provide unique opportunities to study properties related to inflationary physics . to understand requirements for the direction detection , we summarize some of the key aspects related to the stochastic background .",
