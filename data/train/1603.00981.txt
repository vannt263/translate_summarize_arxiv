    "it is being believed that the idea of incorporating a small mass to the graviton will definitely lead to a new modified theory of gravity .",
    "the first attempt towards the realization of this theory was initiated by fierz and pauli @xcite .",
    "they added a quadratic mass to the action as , @xmath0 but it is observed that this linearized fierz - pauli theory violates the gauge invariance in general relativity .",
    "considering the linear fierz - pauli theory in the zero limit of graviton mass , i.e. , @xmath1 , the theory was unable to recover the general relativity .",
    "this mismatch leads to contradiction with the solar system tests due to van dam - veltman - zakharov discontinuity @xcite , regardless of smallness of graviton mass , the relativistic and non relativistic matter couple to gravity with different relative strengths . by introducing the nonlinear effects using vainshtein @xcite mechanism ,",
    "the problems due to vdvz discontinuity can be solved out .",
    "but the massive gravity theory in this nonlinear situation , losses the momentum constraints as well as the hamiltonian constraints and they lead to a situation where the gravity suffers from an instability known as the boulware - deser ( bd)ghost @xcite , as a result of an extra degree of freedom other than the five degrees of freedom of a massive spin-2 field in a poincare invariant background .",
    "recently de rham - gabadadze - tolley ( drgt ) @xcite has introduced a theory which is free from the bd ghost .",
    "the dgrt theory consists of a three parameter family of potentials , which in turn produce a dynamical constraint which can be used to remove the degree of freedom which acts as the bd ghost .",
    "even the absence of bd ghost does not make the theory consistent in every manner , the diffeomorphism invariance broken due to mass term was one of the major problem .",
    "the st@xmath2ckelberg mechanism @xcite can be used to overcome this situation .",
    "it can be done by introducing four auxiliary scalars @xmath3 via @xmath4 . using this pure gauge st@xmath2ckelberg field , the original theory ,",
    "the general relativity can be recovered using a unitary gauge , @xmath5 hence this nonlinear st@xmath2ckelberg formalism brings back the diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "recently , interesting black hole solutions of massive gravity have been found in @xcite .",
    "various black hole and cosmological solutions of the massive gravity theory are intensively studied in recent years .",
    "black holes receive attention of the many , as they are identified as thermodynamic objects with a physical temperature and entropy @xcite as well as there exist an analogy between black hole system and the non gravitational thermodynamic system @xcite . hence exploring the thermodynamics of black holes will eventually give many ideas regarding the corresponding gravity theory of the black hole system .",
    "the analysis of black hole phase transitions , which are entropically driven in einstein s theory , but depends on other parameters in modified theories are of prime importance in black hole thermodynamic studies .",
    "black hole phase transition studies can be done in two ways .",
    "one , by calculating the heat capacity of black hole space time and there by studying the transition between thermodynamically stable phase and unstable phase .",
    "the second method is by incorporating differential geometry ideas in to black hole thermodynamics .",
    "recently , this geometric method gained attention , since it can be used as a convenient tool to study the thermodynamics and the corresponding phase transition structures of black holes .",
    "various investigations are done by incorporating the idea of contact geometry in to the study of black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the recent method in this context is a new geometric formalism , known as the geometrothermodynamics proposed by quevedo et.al @xcite .",
    "this method can give exact explanations for all the thermodynamic behaviors as well as the exact phase structure of black hole systems .    a brief outline of the paper",
    "is as follows : in section 2 , we review the ideas of geometrothermodynamics .",

    "let us consider the physics of the curvature parameter @xmath35 in details .",
    "from the black hole space time metric ( [ mrnds_transformed ] ) , and comparing it with the charged ds or ads black hole in einstein s gravity theory , one can easily identify the cosmological constant term in massive gravity as , @xmath64 we know that in most black hole thermodynamic studies , the cosmological constant is treated as a fixed parameter .",
    "but it has been suggested that it is better to treat @xmath65 as a thermodynamic variable @xcite . in many studies , this cosmological constant",

    "the cosmological constant generated pressure can be written as , @xmath66 from ( [ cosmologicalconstant ] ) , one can rewrite the pressure generated by cosmological constant in massive gravity as , @xmath67 hence the choice of curvature parameter @xmath35 will determine whether the space time is de sitter or anti de sitter . the presence of negative pressure , by choosing the curvature parameter as positive , point towards the accelerated expansion of the present universe .",
    "further studies in this direction may lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon . throughout this paper",
    "we consider the dependency of curvature parameter on the thermodynamic behaviors hence indirectly the effects of cosmological constant and pressure .",

    "from figure ( [ temp_ds_fig ] ) we can see that for the flat case ( @xmath68 ) , the temperature is always negative , and hence has no physical significance . for the spherically symmetric space time case ( @xmath69 )",
    ", the temperature initially enters in to a physically insignificant region ( with negative temperature ) and lies in a positive region for intermediate sized black holes . for black holes with larger horizon",
    "radius it again goes to the negative temperature regions .",
    "for the hyperbolic space time case ( @xmath70 ) , the behaviour exactly resembles that of flat space time .",
    "so for the rnds case in massive gravity for spherically symmetric space time , there exists a window at which the black hole has positive temperatures and hence lies in a physically significant region .",
    "the variation of heat capacity depicted in figure ( [ spec_ds_fig ] ) shows that , black hole undergoes phase transitions for all the cases , @xmath71 . for flat and hyperbolic space time cases ,",
    "the black hole lies in a thermodynamically unstable phase and undergoes a infinite discontinuity and become thermodynamically stable . but for spherically symmetric space time , the black hole goes from thermodynamically stable region to an unstable region at many points including the infinite discontinuity transitions for black hole with lower horizon radius .              in this section",
    "we will consider the case in which the curvature parameter is taken as negative ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "for this case the the black hole solution ( [ mrnds_transformed ] ) reduces to charged anti de sitter solution in massive gravity ( rnads ) . here",
    "also variation of temperature and specific heat against entropy for different space time cases are depicted in figure ( [ temp_ads_fig ] ) and ( [ spec_ads_fig ] ) .",
    "temperature variation in figures ( [ temp_ads_fig ] ) , implies that for each space time cases , the black hole changes from unphysical region to a region which has physical significance .",
    "but for the spherically symmetric space time case , the temperature goes to a maximum positive value and falls down to lower values .",
    "hence a temperature window - like behaviour is shown by these black holes too .            from the figures ( [ spec_ads_fig ] )",
    "we can infer that the for the flat case , the specific heat goes from negative values to positive values and hence the black hole system changes from a thermodynamically unstable phase to a stable phase without any phase transitions .",
    "this behaviour exactly resembles that of rnds black holes .",
    "this resemblance exists in the hyperbolic space time case too . for the spherically symmetric case , the black hole initially lies in a thermodynamically unstable region and transit to a stable phase .",
    "later it undergoes a phase transition in which the stable black hole becomes an unstable one .",
    "now let us consider the situation that the graviton has no mass ( @xmath63 ) , then the black hole system given by ( [ mrnds_transformed ] ) will reduce to a charged black hole solution in einstein s general relativity , i.e. , reissner - nordstrm black hole solution . for @xmath63 case",
    ", one can write down the metric @xmath72 from ( [ mrnds_transformed ] ) as , @xmath73            it is evident from the above equation that , it exactly matches with the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution in einstein s general relativity .",
    "solving the above equation ( [ rnmetric ] ) , and using the relation @xmath52 , one can easily write the mass of the black hole as , @xmath74 from the usual thermodynamic relations @xmath75 and @xmath76 one can write temperature and heat capacity respectively as , @xmath77 and @xmath78 the variation of both temperature and heat capacity are plotted . from the figures ( [ temp_gr_fig ] ) and ( [ spec_gr_fig ] ) , we can see that for flat case ( @xmath68 ) as well as for the hyperbolic ( @xmath70 ) case temperature always lies in the negative value region and hence in physically insignificant region .",
    "now for the spherically symmetric space time case ( @xmath69 ) , black hole initially lies in a negative temperature region and as the black hole horizon radius increases it goes to a maximum temperature value . after the maximum value of temperature",
    "is attained it lies in the positive temperature region itself .",
    "we can see that when mass of the graviton becomes zero , it exactly reproduces the results of rn black holes .",
    "so the limiting case of rnds or rnads black hole in massive gravity coincides with rn solution in einstein s theory and their thermodynamic behaviour gives the proof for the same .",
    "to investigate the mathematical structure of thermodynamic systems , it is very convenient to use contact geometry . in order to incorporate the idea of differential geometry",
    ", one has to first define a @xmath79 thermodynamic phase space @xmath80 .",
    "this phase space is coordinated by the set @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is an arbitrary thermodynamic potential , the coordinates @xmath83 correspond to the extensive variables and @xmath84 are the corresponding dual intensive variables , where @xmath85 we can introduce the contact 1-form or fundamental gibbs 1-form as @xcite , @xmath86 with summation over the repeated indices . now if @xmath87 is differentiable and @xmath88 satisfies the condition @xmath89 , then @xmath90 can be called as a contact manifold .",
    "now consider an @xmath91 dimensional manifold @xmath92 , which is a sub manifold of @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath93 , which can be defined using the extensive thermodynamic variables @xmath83 .",
    "this equilibrium manifold @xmath92 can be realized by considering a smooth harmonic mapping @xmath94 , @xmath95 and the condition @xmath93 , can be realized using the condition , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the pullback . from the relation ( [ pullback ] ) one can easily deduce the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium as , @xmath98 considering the equilibrium manifold @xmath92 and using ( [ pullback ] ) , the first law of thermodynamics can be written as , @xmath99 the harmonic map @xmath100 demands the existence of the function @xmath101 , which is commonly known as the fundamental equation in classical thermodynamics from which one can deduce all the equation of states corresponding to that system . from this fundamental equation ,",
    "one can write the second law of thermodynamics as , @xmath102 also known as the convexity condition . in the above equation ,",
    "the sign depends on the choice of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "for example , if one chooses @xmath82 as entropy , then the sign becomes positive and it becomes negative when the potential is chosen to be the internal energy .",
    "now let us consider a riemannian metric @xmath103 on @xmath87 , which must be invariant with respect to legendre transformations .",
    "then the riemannian contact manifold can be defined as the set @xmath104 and the equilibrium manifold can be written as a sub manifold of @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "this sub manifold satisfies the above discussed pull back condition @xcite . the non - degenerate metric @xmath103 and the thermodynamic metric @xmath105 can be written as , @xmath106 and , @xmath107 with @xmath108=diag(-1,1,1, .. ,1 ) and this metric is legendre invariant because of the invariance of the gibbs 1-form .",
    "now by calculating the curvature scalar of the gtd metric([quevedo metric ] ) , one can use gtd as a method to investigate the phase transition structure of the black hole system .    in this section",
    "we investigate the phase transition of the charged black hole solution in massive gravity by using the concept of geometrothermodynamics ( gtd ) .",
    "now we will introduce the ideas of gtd in to the charged black hole system in massive gravity .",
    "for this , we will construct a @xmath109 dimensional thermodynamic phase space @xmath87 using the extensive variables and their dual intensive variables as coordinates . in the present case ,",
    "coordinates are given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are extensive variables and @xmath112 are their corresponding dual intensive variables .",
    "now one can write the gibbs 1-form as , @xmath113 now using the idea of equilibrium manifold , one can write the gtd metric as , @xmath114.\\ ] ] then , the legendre invariant scalar curvature corresponding to the above metric is given by , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a complicated expression of less physical interest .",
    "now we will investigate the thermodynamic behaviour of the black hole system using the scalar curvature . according to the theory of geometrothermodynamics , the points of zero scalar curvature as well as the infinite discontinuities will exactly matches with the singular behaviours of thermodynamic potentials which corresponds to the black hole system .",
    "now let us evaluate different charged black hole system in massive gravity , as they vary with respect to mass of the graviton , topology of the solutions and the sign of the curvature parameter .",
    "the variation of ricci scalar curvature with entropy is depicted in figures ( [ ricci_ds_fig ] ) and ( [ ricci_ads_fig ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the case in which the curvature parameter , @xmath35 is taken as positive , then as we have discussed earlier , the black hole system will behave like charged de - sitter black hole system . from the figures ( [ ricci_ds_fig ] ) it is evident that , all singular points in the thermodynamic parameters like temperature and heat capacity are exactly reproduced by the ricci scalar either by vanishing or showing infinite discontinuities at the same points . for the second case also ricci scalar behaves in a similar manner , where the curvature parameter , @xmath35 is taken as negative , and hence the the black hole system becomes a charged anti de - sitter black hole system .",
    "the variation of scalar curvature for this case is plotted in figures ( [ ricci_ads_fig ] ) .",
    "now let us investigate the geometrothermodynamics and the behaviour of legendre invariant scalar curvature of the black hole system , when the mass off the graviton becomes zero .",
    "the corresponding variation of ricci scalar is depicted in figure ( [ ricci_grds_fig ] ) and ( [ ricci_grads_fig ] ) . here too , the singularities of the ricci scalar matches with those of temperature and heat capacity of the rn black hole in einstein s general relativity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the gtd results obtained from the charged black hole solution in massive gravity coincides with the study of rn black hole previously obtained in @xcite .",
    "hence the geometrothermodynamics exactly reproduces the phase transition structure of the charged black hole solutions in massive gravity .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the black hole thermodynamics and geometrothermodynamics of the charged de - sitter and anti de - sitter solutions in massive gravity .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to discuss the phase transition as well as the singular behaviours in thermodynamic potentials using gtd method .",
    "we used the quevedo metric or gtd metric to obtain the legendre invariant ricci scalar curvature .",
    "we analysed the thermodynamic behaviour using both analytical and graphical methods .",
    "the analysis showed that , the singular behaviours in the thermodynamic potentials , including the point where heat capacity diverges , exactly reproduced by the ricci scalar obtained using the gtd metric .",
    "hence we can say that , gtd metric exactly reproduces the phase transition structure of charged black holes in massive gravity and their corresponding thermodynamic interactions",
    ". from this study it is evident that the charged black holes in massive gravity undergoes a phase transition .",
    "one expects that thermodynamics of black holes would be the same as in general relativity , taking into account that massive gravity differs from general relativity by a non - derivative coupling to a fiducial metric .",
    "but our studies show that , even though the results agrees with general relativity when massive parameter tends to zero , there are significant changes in the phase transition structure of the system when @xmath117 . comparative studies on analytical and graphical representation of the changes of heat capacity and ricci scalar against entropy and massive parameter of the black hole system reveal the same result .",
    "also the present study shows that , like all other charged black hole solutions in einstein s gravity and in all modified gravities , there exists a temperature window , where the black hole temperature lies in a physically significant region with positive temperature .",
