    "let @xmath0 be infinite dimensional hilbert spaces and @xmath1 a bounded linear operator .",
    "if @xmath2 , the range of @xmath3 , is not closed it is well known that the linear operator equation @xmath4 is ill - posed , in the sense that @xmath5 , the moore - penrose generalized inverse of @xmath3 , is not bounded @xcite .",
    "the moore - penrose generalized inverse is strongly related to the least - squares ( ls ) solutions of ( [ eq:0 ] ) .",
    "in fact equation ( [ eq:0 ] ) has a ls solution if and only if @xmath6 belongs to @xmath7 , the domain of @xmath5 , which is defined as @xmath8 . in that case , @xmath9 is the best approximate solution ( i.e. the ls solution of minimum norm ) and the set of all ls solutions of ( [ eq:0 ] ) is given by @xmath10 . if the problem is ill - posed , then @xmath11 does not depend continuously on the data @xmath6 .",
    "hence if instead of the exact data @xmath6 , only an approximation @xmath12 is available , with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the noise level or observation error , then it is possible that @xmath15 does not exist or , if it exists , then it will not necessarily be a good approximation of @xmath11 , even if @xmath16 is very small .",
    "this instability becomes evident when trying to approximate @xmath11 by standard numerical methods and procedures .",
    "thus , for instance , except under rather restrictive conditions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the application of the standard ls approximations procedure on a sequence @xmath17 of finite dimensional subspaces of @xmath18 , whose union is dense in @xmath18 , will result in a sequence @xmath19 of ls approximating solutions which does not converge to @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) . moreover",
    ", this divergence can occur with arbitrarily large speed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ill - posed problems must be regularized before pretending to successfully attack the problem of numerically approximating their solutions .",
    "regularizing an ill - posed problem such as ( [ eq:0 ] ) essentially means approximating the operator @xmath5 by a parametric family of continuous operators @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is called the regularization parameter .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] , let @xmath24 be a continuous ( not necessarily linear ) operator .",
    "the set @xmath25 is said to be a `` family of regularization operators '' ( fro ) for @xmath5 , if for every @xmath26 , there exists a parameter choice rule @xmath27 such that @xmath28 here the parameter choice rule @xmath29 is such that @xmath30    if @xmath26 , then @xmath11 satisfies the normal equation @xmath31 and @xmath11 can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spectral family associated to the self - adjoint operator @xmath34 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . however , since we are assuming that @xmath2 is not closed ( and therefore @xmath35 ) , if @xmath36 then the integral in ( [ eq : int - inv ] ) does not exist since in that case @xmath37 and @xmath38 has a pole at 0 .",
    "moreover in this case , the operator @xmath5 defined in ( [ eq : int - inv ] ) for @xmath39 , is not bounded .",
    "for that reason , many regularization methods are based on spectral theory and consist on defining @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a family of functions appropriately defined such that for every @xmath42 $ ] there holds @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be a parametric family of functions @xmath45 defined for all @xmath22 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath44 is a `` spectral regularization method '' ( srm ) , if it satisfies the following hypotheses :    _ h1_. for every fixed @xmath46 @xmath47 is piecewise continuous with respect to @xmath48 , for @xmath49 ;    _ h2_. there exists a constant @xmath50 ( independent of @xmath21 ) such that @xmath51 for every @xmath49 ;    _",
    "h3_. for every @xmath52 , @xmath53    it can be shown that if @xmath44 is a srm then the family of operators @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 is a fro for @xmath5 ( @xcite , theorem 4.1 ) . in this case",
    "we shall say that @xmath56 is a ",
    "spectral regularization family \" for @xmath5 .",
    "the use of this terminology has to do with the fact that each one of its elements is defined in terms of an integral with respect to the spectral family @xmath57 associated to the operator @xmath34 .",
    "note that given the operator @xmath3 , it is sufficient that @xmath47 be defined for @xmath58 $ ] , since @xmath59 is  constant \" outside that interval .",
    "it is well known that for ill - posed problems it is not possible to reconstruct the exact solution @xmath11 with any degree of accuracy unless additional _ a - priori _ information about @xmath11 is available ( @xcite , @xcite proposition 3.11 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "given certain _ a - priori _ information about @xmath11 , it could be desirable to know the best order of convergence ( of the regularization error @xmath60 as a function of the regularization parameter @xmath21 , or of the total error @xmath61 as a function of the noise level @xmath16 ) , that can be achieved with a regularization method under those _ a - priori _ assumptions .",
    "conversely , given an order of convergence , one could be interested in determining the possible existence of  source sets \" on which a certain regularization method reaches that order of convergence . in this case",
    "it could further be of interest to determine  maximal source sets \" .",
    "all these problems are strongly related to the concepts of qualification and saturation of a regularization method ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    "the notion of qualification of a regularization method was introduced for the first time and the decisive role of this concept in relation to the order of convergence of the regularization error was shown . in the sequel , we shall simply denote with @xmath41 the srm @xmath62 .",
    "we now recall the definition of classical qualification for srms ( see @xcite ) .",

    "first introduced the following definition of qualification for a spectral regularization method , formalizing and extending the classical notion of the concept .",
    "[ def : calif - mathe ] let @xmath69\\rightarrow ( 0,\\infty)$ ] be an increasing function .",

    "it is important to point out that in @xcite the  classical qualification \" of a method was defined to be the number @xmath67 in definition [ def : calif - clasica ] ( even in the case @xmath75 ) . however , from our point of view the  generalized qualification \" of a method will not be a number but rather a function of the regularization parameter @xmath21 as an order of convergence in the sense of definition [ def : calif - mathe ] . in the case of srms with classical qualification of positive finite order @xmath67 , the corresponding generalized qualification will be shown to be the function @xmath76 , coinciding with the classical approach . since in the extreme cases",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath75 that function does not define an order of convergence , we have preferred to exclude them from the definition of classical qualification ( definition [ def : calif - clasica ] ) and , accordingly , we shall say that the method does not have classical qualification .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section 2 the concepts of weak and strong source - order pair and of order - source pair",
    "are defined and three qualification levels for srm are introduced : weak , strong and optimal . a sufficient condition for the existence of weak qualification is provided and necessary and sufficient conditions for an order of convergence to be strong or optimal qualification are given .",
    "in section 3 , examples of all qualification levels are provided and the relationships between them and with the classical qualification and the qualification introduced in @xcite are shown .",
    "in particular , srms having qualification in each one of the three levels and not having classical qualification are presented .",
    "finally several implications of this theory in the context of orders of convergence , converse results and maximal source sets for inverse ill - posed problems are shown in section 4 .",
    "it is well known that there exist srms for which the corresponding @xmath67 given in definition [ def : calif - clasica ] is infinity , e.g.truncated singular value decomposition ( tsvd ) , landweber s method and showalter s method .",
    "however , a careful analysis leads to observe that the concept of qualification as optimal order of convergence of the regularization error remains alive underlying most of these and many other methods . in this section",
    "we generalize the definition of qualification introduced by math - pereverzev in @xcite and thereby the notion of classical qualification of a srm .",
    "also three different levels of qualification are introduced : weak , strong and optimal .",
    "these levels introduce natural hierarchical categories for the srms and we show that the generalized qualification corresponds to the lowest of these levels . moreover , a sufficient condition which guarantees that a srm possesses qualification in the sense of this generalization is provided and necessary and sufficient conditions for a given order of convergence to be strong or optimal qualification are found .",
    "we denote with @xmath78 the set of all non decreasing functions @xmath79 such that @xmath80 and with @xmath81 the set of all continuous functions @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 and such that @xmath84 for every @xmath85 if moreover @xmath86 is increasing , then it is an _",
