    "it has recently become evident that the spectra of distant galaxies frequently show mg  ii  2796 , 2803 in the classic p  cygni profile of redshifted emission and blueshifted absorption .",
    "such emission is notably absent in @xmath3 analogues .",
    "@xcite reported the first detection of mg  ii emission in distant galaxies , finding mg  ii emission with a p  cygni profile in the stacked spectra of z@xmath41.4 galaxies .",
    "they attributed this emission to a small fraction ( 50 out of 1400 ) of the sample , `` most probably from narrow - line active galactic nuclei '' , in part because of a high - velocity tail in the emission line profile .",
    "@xcite repeated this analysis on a lower - redshift ( 0.7@xmath5z@xmath51.5 ) sample of galaxies , and found mg  ii emission in the stack of 468 galaxies , as well as in some individual galaxy spectra . they suggested that this mg  ii emission arises not from nuclear accretion , but from resonant scattering in an expanding wind , analogous to the resonant scattering of lyman alpha .",
    "@xcite found mg  ii emission that extended spatially across at least 7  kpc in a z@xmath40.69 galaxy , which also showed prominent fe  ii * fine structure emission .",
    "the authors noted that the fe  ii * and mg  ii kinematics did not resemble those of nebular emission lines .",
    "they argued that the mg  ii resonant emission and the fe  ii * fine structure emission most likely arise via photon scattering in an outflowing wind .",
    "@xcite found mg  ii and fe  ii * emission in a stack of 33 galaxies at z@xmath41.6 , and in a stack of 92 galaxies at 1.65@xmath5z@xmath52.5 .",
    "they note that at matched spectral resolution , non - agn z@xmath40 galaxies show no such mg  ii and fe  ii * emission @xcite , except for the wolf - rayet galaxy tol 1924 - 416 .",
    "none of the galaxies in the @xcite stacks are detected in 4  ms of chandra x - ray integration , which argues against the significant presence of x - ray  luminous agn .",
    "@xcite showed how common mg  ii and fe  ii * emission are in 1@xmath5z@xmath52 galaxies .",
    "mg  ii emission is seen in one - third of their sample : 33 of 93 galaxies .",
    "fe  ii * emission appears even more ubiquitous , appearing in all the stacks of subsamples .",
    "@xcite simulate mg  ii p cygni profiles like those observed in these distant galaxies , using a monte carlo radiative transfer model that assumes a cool , outflowing wind .",
    "thus , while the first detections of mg  ii emission lines in galaxies were thought to be a rare curiosity with a suspected agn origin , such emission is now recognized as common in distant star - forming galaxies , though notably absent in z@xmath40 analogues .    in this paper",
    ", we examine mg  ii emission and absorption from five star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 that have been gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters . while our sample size is much smaller than field samples , lensing magnification has enabled us to obtain much higher  quality spectra of individual galaxies .",
    "we compare the mg  ii emission to the strengths and profiles of other emission lines , to better understand where this mg  ii emission arises , and what its physical origins are .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper are part of a larger study of the rest - ultraviolet spectral properties of bright lensed galaxies , which we are conducting with the mage spectrograph @xcite on the clay magellan ii telescope .",
    "the galaxies discussed in this paper are the five from our larger sample that have redshifts such that both the lyman  @xmath0  and mg  ii  2796 , 2803  features have spectral coverage .",
    "four of the five galaxies discussed here are drawn from the sdss giant arcs sample ( sgas ) , a set of bright gravitationally lensed galaxies ( gladders et al .  in prep ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the other galaxy , rcs0327 @xcite , comes from the second red sequence cluster survey @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : obslog ] gives total integration times and dates of the observations .",
    "further details of observations , data reduction , and full spectra will be published in future papers .    for rcs0327 , we obtained mage spectra for four distinct star - forming knots , labeled e , u , b , g , following the nomenclature of @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for knot e has the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "for three galaxies , we measured systemic redshifts by fitting the c iii ] 1907 , 1909  doublet with two gaussians .",
    "the fit was constrained such that both lines shared a common linewidth .",
    "the redshift was allowed to vary , with the ratio of the central wavelengths held fixed .",
    "s1441 lacks detected ciii ] or other systemic lines ; we therefore arbitrarily choose a systemic redshift of z@xmath41.666 , which puts the reddest mg  ii 2796    absorption at zero velocity .",
    "rcs0327 has a complex velocity structure because it is undergoing a major merger @xcite . for knot e of rcs0327",
    "the c iii ] emission is blended with fe ii 2600 absorption from an intervening system at z@xmath40.98295 ; we therefore instead use si  ii *  1264 , si  ii *  1309 , si  ii *  1533 , and si  iii ]  1882 , finding a weighted - average emission line redshift of @xmath6 for knot e. ( this redshift is consistent within uncertainties with the section of the c iii ] profile that is not contaminated by intervening fe ii absorption . ) table  [ tab : redshifts ] lists the measured systemic redshifts .",
    "@xcite reasoned that mg  ii emission in z  @xmath7 12 galaxies should be similar to lyman  @xmath0  emission , since both emission lines show p cygni profiles , and since their emission strengths are generally correlated with uv color .",
    "however , since they lacked spectral coverage of lyman  @xmath0 , they could not directly compare mg  ii and lyman  @xmath0   emission profiles or equivalent widths .",
    "in table  [ tab : ews ] we report rest - frame equivalent widths and 2@xmath8 upper limits for emission lines .",
    "reported uncertainties incorporate the statistical uncertainty as well as the systematic uncertainty due to continuum estimation .",
    "we determined the systematic uncertainty empirically by comparing continuum fitting methods ; different methods agree well and have a standard deviation that is typically less than half the measurement uncertainty .    in figure  1",
    ", we compare the equivalent widths of mg  ii emission and lyman  @xmath0  emission in our sample .",
    "the sample has reasonable dynamic range : the equivalent widths of mg  ii vary by a factor of 6 , and lyman  @xmath0  by a factor of 8 . no correlation is observed .      while the five galaxies in this paper were merely selected from our larger sample as spectral coverage of mg  ii and lyman  @xmath0 , in fact , all five show detected mg  ii emission and absorption in a p cygni profile .",
    "mg  ii spectra are plotted in figure  2 . in  [ sec : discussion ] we explain why the ubiquity of mg  ii emission in our sample is likely a selection effect .",
    "we now examine the velocity structure of the mg  ii emission , compared to other prominent spectral features .",
    "figure  2 presents velocity plots for these five lensed galaxies .",
    "though rcs0327 has spectra measured for four knots , in figure  2 we examine only the spectrum of knot  e , since it has the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "( detailed analysis of knot - to - knot variations in the mg  ii profile within rcs0327 is reserved for a future paper . )",
    "zero velocity corresponds to the systemic redshift of each galaxy , as determined in ",
    "[ sec : systemic ] .    in each galaxy , the mg  ii emission is broader than the c iii ] and [ o ii ] lines , and the peak is redshifted with respect to systemic by 100 to 200  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "when ly  @xmath0 is detected , it is even more redshifted than mg  ii , with peak intensity at 200250  km  s@xmath2 from systemic .    the red `` shoulder '' of mg  ii 2796    emission will be absorbed by the 2803    transition .",
    "thus , the 2803    line is the one to examine for redshifted emission .",
    "the mg  ii profiles of s0108 and rcs0327 knot e show a `` shoulder '' of emission extending @xmath9  km  s@xmath2 redward of systemic .",
    "the lyman  @xmath0  emission in s0108 and s0957 also show redshifted shoulders to even higher velocities ( @xmath10600  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "such extreme velocities imply a strong outflow .",
    "this result can be stated more generally : all the strong , high signal - to - noise mg  ii and lyman  @xmath0  emission lines in our sample show high - velocity red `` shoulders '' .",
    "mg  ii emission is present in all five of the gravitationally  lensed galaxies in our sample .",
    "this may seem surprising , given that @xcite find such emission in only one - third of their sample .",
    "an explanation may lie in the fact that mg  ii emission is stronger in the erb et al .",
    "stacked subsamples with lower stellar mass and bluer color ; the reasons for this remain unclear . the lensed galaxies in our sample are quite blue . while we are still developing the lensing models required to infer intrinsic stellar mass for this sample , galaxies selected in a similar way have stellar masses around @xmath11  m@xmath12 @xcite , which would put them in the lower - mass bin of erb et al . , the bin that showed strongest mg  ii emission . lensed arc samples should be biased toward galaxies with high surface brightness features , in other words high specific star formation rates .",
    "given the @xcite results , it is not surprising that the highly - magnified , high surface brightness star - forming regions captured within the mage slit should show mg  ii emission .    in rcs0327 , the mage spectra capture four different star - forming knots , but in the other four galaxies , the mage spectra capture only one bright knot of emission per galaxy .",
    "past work shows that such knots typically extend only a few 100 pc @xcite . in a future paper , we will examine the spatial variation of mg  ii emission within rcs0327 .",
    "the lack of a correlation between the equivalent widths of mg  ii and lyman  @xmath0  emission is striking , and can be interpreted in several ways . since",
    "lyman  @xmath0  is a bluer transition with a higher absorption cross - section than mg  ii , it can be expected to be more heavily obscured by dust .",
    "galaxy - to - galaxy variations in extinction might erase an intrinsic correlation between mg  ii and lyman  @xmath0emission , if present . a similar decoupling between uv continuum and lyman  @xmath0  emission was proposed by @xcite .",
    "an alternate explanation for the lack of correlation would be that lyman  @xmath0  and mg  ii emission do not share common origins . as a hydrogen recombination line , lyman  @xmath0originates in h  ii regions , and is then resonantly scattered .",
    "the origin of mg  ii emission in distant galaxies is not well established ; the two models proposed in the literature are intrinsic production of line emission in nebular regions with subsequent scattering , and intrinsic production of continuum photons that are resonantly scattered .",
    "plasma models of h  ii regions ( cloudy , @xcite ) predict weak nebular mg  ii emission ( @xcite , their figure 16 ) ; the dominant emission mechanism is the excitation of mg@xmath13 by electron impact ( g. ferland , priv .",
    "thus , the flux of any _ nebular _ component of mg  ii emission should be tied to the electron temperature and luminosity of the h  ii regions and the lyman  @xmath0  flux , and not tied to the amount of mg  ii absorption .",
    "a future study could test for a correlation between the extinction - corrected h @xmath0 luminosity , which traces star formation rate , and the luminosity of mg  ii emission .",
    "nebular mg  ii emission is observed in the local universe , in the orion h  ii region complex , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected mg  ii emission at low resolution with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) for a part of orion ; the flux of the emission was comparable to but less than c  iii ] 1909 .",
    "in high - resolution spectra of six regions of orion , @xcite find that the mg  ii emission ranges from 0.04 to 1.35 times the strength of [ o ii ] 2470   , and 0.25 to 25 times the strength of the c iii ] 1907,1909    doublet . by comparison , in our five galaxies , mg",
    "ii emission is much stronger than both [ o ii ]  2470 and c  iii ]  1907 .",
    "these high line flux ratios argue against an intrinsically nebular origin for the bulk of the mg  ii emission .",
    "mg  ii emission could also arise through the scattering of continuum photons that have the wavelength of the mg  ii doublet , and are resonantly scattered through a velocity gradient until they emerge as mg  ii emission .",
    "if the ultimate origin of mg  ii emission is from continuum photons , then the equivalent width of mg  ii emission should have no connection to that of lyman  @xmath0 , but instead be tied to the mg  ii absorbing column density and the characteristics of the outflowing wind .",
    "this could be examined in future work , for example by testing for a correlation between mg  ii emission and the intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  emission inferred from the observed fluxes of lyman alpha and two balmer lines .",
    "the galaxies in our sample show a complex velocity structure in the emission components , with mg  ii redshifted with respect to the nebular and fe  ii * lines , and lyman  @xmath0  ( when present ) even more redshifted , with a tail to more than 600  km  s@xmath2 from systemic .",
    "these observations can provide new insights into the wind structure of z@xmath72 star - forming galaxies , through future multi - ion wind modeling .",
    "for now , it is enough to say that the mg  ii emission does not have the velocity structure of either the nebular emission or the lyman  @xmath0  emission .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of mg  ii emission is emitted from physically different regions of the galaxy than is the nebular or lyman  @xmath0   emission .    to conclude",
    ", the rest - ultraviolet spectra of five lensed galaxies presented here reveal that mg  ii emission is not a simple proxy for lyman @xmath0 emission ; its equivalent width is uncorrelated with that of lyman  @xmath0 , and its velocity structure is different as well .",
    "mg  ii emission , since it is bright and common in @xmath14 galaxies , may prove to be a powerful diagnostic of winds driven by star formation in distant galaxies , once more work is done to understand its physical origin and radiative transfer .",
