    "neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries accrete matter from solar mass companion stars .",
    "the sub - group of neutron - star transients spend most of their time in quiescence during which hardly any or no accretion occurs onto their neutron stars .",
    "however , these transients sporadically become very luminous in x - rays ( @xmath13@xmath14  ergs s@xmath2 ) owing to a huge increase in the accretion rate . during those outbursts",
    ", these sources can be readily studied with the available x - ray instruments , but so far only about a dozen sources have been studied in their much dimmer quiescent states . in quiescence",
    ", they typically exhibit 0.510 kev luminosities of @xmath15  ergs s@xmath2  and their spectra are usually dominated by a soft component which can be described by a thermal model ( either a black - body or a neutron - star atmosphere model ) .",
    "this emission is generally ascribed to the cooling of the neutron star which has been heated during the outbursts ( e.g. , via deep crustal heating ; brown , bildsten , & rutledge 1998 ) . for several quiescent systems",
    "an additional power - law shaped component is present in their x - ray spectra and it dominates above a few kev ( e.g. , asai et al . 1998 ; rutledge et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the origin of this power - law component is not understood but it has been proposed to be due to residual accretion on the neutron - star magnetic field , an active pulsar mechanism , or shock emission due to the interaction of the pulsar wind and matter which is still being transferred from the companion star ( e.g. , stella et al .  1994 ; campana et al .  1998 ; campana & stella 2000 ) .",
    "the fractional contribution of this power - law component to the flux in the 0.510 kev energy range varies significantly between systems . in some systems",
    "this component can not be detected ( with less than 10% of the 0.510 kev flux possibly due to such a component ) , but in other systems it contributes up to half the emission in the 0.510 kev energy range ( e.g. , asai et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al .  2001 ) .",
    "currently , only two quiescent systems ( sax j1808.43658 and exo 1745248 ) have been found to exhibit quiescent spectra which are fully dominated by the power - law component ( with over 90% of the 0.510 kev flux due to the power - law component ; campana et al .",

    "2004 ) it has also been found that the quiescent spectra could be adequately fitted with only a power - law model . however , the statistics of the data for those sources were rather limited , still allowing for a thermal component which contributed more than 50%70% to the 0.510 kev flux .    during outburst sax j1808.43658",

    "2002 ) might be related to the expected higher magnetic field strength of the neutron star in this system , compared to that of the neutron stars in the non - pulsating systems .",
    "however , the recent study of the neutron - star x - ray transient exo 1745248 located in the globular cluster terzan 5 during its quiescent state has cast doubt on this hypothesis",
    ". wijnands et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the terzan 5 system , which is not observed to pulsate during outburst , also had a quiescent spectrum which was fully dominated by the power - law component ( more than 90% of the 0.510 kev flux was due to the power - law component ) just like sax j1808.43658 .",
    "however , exo 1745248 had a quiescent luminosity ( @xmath0@xmath17 ergs s@xmath2 ) which was a factor of @xmath040 higher than what has been observed for sax j1808.43658 .",
    "the physical process(es ) behind the power - law component and the differences among sources in terms of the properties of this spectral component are unknown .",
    "however , some clues about the nature of this spectral component were recently glimpsed in the work by jonker et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) .",
    "they compared all quiescent neutron star x - ray transients for which spectral information was available and found that the fractional contribution of the power - law component to the 0.510 kev fluxes is lowest when these sources have quiescent luminosities of @xmath18 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "they found that both at higher and lower quiescent luminosities the fractional contribution of the power - law component to the 0.510 kev flux increases .",
    "so far , only exo 1745248 did not follow this correlation .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this transient is an unusual system or if the correlation found by jonker et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) is spurious and more sources similar to exo 1745248 will be found .    in recent years , four additional accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ( after sax j1808.43658 )",

    "; markwardt , smith , & swank 2003 ; markwardt & swank 2003 ) .",
    "those systems are prime targets to observe in quiescence to test the hypothesis that the unusual quiescent properties of sax j1808.43658 are due to a relatively strong neutron - star magnetic field strength compared to that of the non - pulsating systems : one would expect that the magnetic fields of the neutron stars in those additional systems are of similar strength as that of the neutron star in sax j1808.43658 . to this end",

    "we used the tool wavdetect to search for point sources in our data of xte j0929314 and to obtain the coordinates of each source which was detected .",
    "for xte j0929314 , we used the tool dmextract to extract the number of observed photons and the count rate ( for the energy range 0.38 kev ) .",
    "as source extraction region we used a circle centered on the source position ( as obtained with wavdetect ) with a radius of 1.5@xmath20 . for background extraction region we used an annulus centered on the source position with an inner radius of 5@xmath20 and an outer radius of @xmath21 ( a larger outer radius could not be used since the field source cxou j092919.1312244 was within @xmath22 of xte j0929314 as can be seen in fig .",

    "we detected four sources in our image , including xte j0929314 ; we will not discuss the other three sources further in this article .",
    "instead we concentrate on the observed x - ray properties of xte j0929314 in its quiescent state .",
    "the coordinates we obtained for xte j0929314 are right ascension @xmath23 and declination @xmath24 ( epoch j2000.0 ) , which are consistent with the coordinates of the source obtained during outbursts in the x - ray ( juett , galloway , & chakrabarty 2003 ) , optical ( greenhill , giles , & hill 2002 ) , and radio bands ( rupen , dhawan , & mioduszewski 2002 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] right panel ) .",
    "the total number of source photons detected in the energy range 0.38 kev from xte j0929314 is 22 , resulting in a net time - averaged count rate of @xmath25 counts s@xmath2 ( after background subtraction ; less than 0.4 background photons are expected in our source extraction region ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : energy - curve ] we plot the energies of the x - ray photons ( 0.38 kev energy range ) detected at the source position against the arrival time of the photons ( measured since the start of the observation ) . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that 4 photons are detected with energies above 3 kev ( note that no photons were detected with energies @xmath135 kev ) and the remainder of the photons have energies below @xmath02.5 kev . in the last @xmath010 ksec of the observation",
    "only two source photons are detected compared with twenty photons during the first @xmath015 ksec ; this might suggest that the source exhibited variability during our observation . to investigate if xte j0929314 was indeed variable during our observation , we applied kolmogorov - smirnov and cramer - von mises tests on the event list ( as shown in figure  [ fig : energy - curve ] ) to attempt to disprove the hypothesis that the source count rate is constant .",
    "both tests showed that xte j0929314 is variable for energies between 0.3 and 8 kev ( although effectively only up to 5 kev since no photons are detected above that energy ) at the 95% confidence level . from figure",
    "[ fig : energy - curve ] it can be seen that the four photons which have energies @xmath133 kev all arrived within the first 5000 seconds of the observation , which may be the main cause of the variability detected in the source .",
    "therefore , we also applied the above two tests to the event list for photon energies between 0.3 and 2.5 kev .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test revealed that the 0.32.5 kev event list might also be variable but only at a 90% confidence level .",
    "the cramer - von mises test could not find evidence for variability in this energy range .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the variability observed in the source is likely stronger at higher photon energies .      despite the low number of photons detected , we extracted the source spectra ( averaged over the whole duration of the observation ) using the ciao tool psextract for the energy range 0.38 kev , which also created the response matrix and the ancillary response files ( the latter was also automatically corrected for the time - variable low - energy quantum efficiency degradation of the ccd ) .",
    "we used a circle with a radius of @xmath26 as source extraction region .",
    "we fitted the spectrum using xspec version 11.3.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the small number of photons observed does not allow for @xmath27 statistics to be used during the fits .",
    "therefore , we fitted the data using cash statistics ( cash 1979 ) .",
    "since cash statistics can not be used on background subtracted spectra , we did not subtract the background from our data .",
    "the errors thus introduced are likely to be small since less than 0.4 background photons are expected in the source extraction region ( see above ) .",
    "the quality of the fits was investigated by generating 10,000 monte carlo simulations of the best - fit spectrum : if the fit is good , roughly half the simulations should have values of the cash statistics which are lower than those of the data .",
    "in all our spectral fits we left the interstellar column density @xmath28 as a free parameter .",
    "to calculate the errors on the obtained fluxes , we fixed each free fit parameter one at a time , either to its minimum or maximum allowed value as obtained from the fits .",
    "after that we refitted the data and recalculated the fluxes .",
    "this process was then repeated for each free parameter and the final flux range determined the flux errors .",
    "the spectra of neutron - star x - ray transients in their quiescent states are usually dominated by a soft thermal component which can adequately be fitted with a neutron - star hydrogen atmosphere model for non - magnetized stars ( the nsa model ; we used that of zavlin , pavlov , & shibanov 1996 ; we also assumed a mass of @xmath29 and a radius of 10 km for the neutron star in xte j0929314 ) .",
    "in such a model the normalization is given by @xmath30 , with @xmath7 the distance to the source in parsecs .",
    "the distance toward xte j0929314 is not known but it is constrained to be @xmath135 kpc ( galloway et al .",
    "when leaving the normalization free , 88% of the simulated spectra have better cash - statistics than the data demonstrating that this model does not provide an accurate description of the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] _ bottom _ ) . from this model",
    "we obtained an effective temperature @xmath31 ( for an observer at infinity ) of @xmath32 kev and the column density is @xmath33@xmath34 @xmath5 .",
    "however , the normalization was constrained to be @xmath33@xmath35 , resulting in a distance constrain of @xmath13316 mpc .",
    "this unrealistic distance limit further demonstrates that a simple nsa model does not provide a good fit to the data .",
    "we also fitted the data using the nsa model but with the normalization fixed and assuming three distances : 5 , 10 , or 15 kpc .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : spectral_fits ] and shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ( top ) . from this table",
    "it can be seen that such a model does not provide an acceptable fit to the data since 100% of the simulated spectra have lower values for the cash - statistics than the data themselves .",
    "we also fitted a simple blackbody model to the data but again such a model did not provide an adequate fit to the data with a fit quality of 0.94 and a @xmath36 of @xmath37 kev ( and @xmath38 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the radius of the emitting area was @xmath39 km , with @xmath7 the distance in kpc , much smaller than the expected radius of a neutron star .",
    "the inability of the thermal models to provide an adequate fit to the data and the fact that four photons are detected with energies above 3 kev point to a x - ray spectrum which is significantly harder than a simple thermal model . therefore , we fitted the x - ray spectrum with a power - law model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ; tab .",
    "[ tab : spectral_fits ] ) .",
    "the fit quality of 0.68 using such a model is considerably better than for a thermal model ( 0.68 versus @xmath130.88 ) .",
    "the fit resulted in a power - law photon index @xmath40 of @xmath3 , a column density of @xmath41 @xmath5 , and a 0.510 kev flux of @xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath5 ( corrected for absorption ) .",
    "this gives an unabsorbed 0.510 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath42 ergs s@xmath2 , with @xmath7 the distance in kpc .",
    "to obtain limits on the temperature and luminosity of a possible thermal component in the data , we fitted the spectrum with a power - law component plus a neutron - star atmosphere component .",
    "we again fixed the normalization of the neutron - star atmosphere component to correspond to 5 , 10 , or 15 kpc but left the other parameters free ( i.e. , the column density , the effective temperature , the photon index , and the normalization of the power - law component ) .",
    "the maximum allowed temperatures and bolometric luminosities are listed in table  [ tab : nsa_limits ] , together with the minimum fraction of the 0.510 kev flux which is due to the power - law component .",
    "the table shows that the maximum allowed @xmath31 is between 0.04 and 0.05 kev with a corresponding maximum allowed bolometric luminosity of @xmath43 ergs s@xmath2 ( for both parameters the highest values are obtained for the cases which assume the largest distance ) . for all assumed distances , at least @xmath070% of the flux in the 0.510 kev range is due to the power - law component .",
    "this demonstrates that the power - law component dominates the x - ray emission in the range 0.510 kev for xte j0929314 .",
    "in   [ subsubsection : cr_0929 ] we demonstrated that xte j0929314 exhibited variability in its count rate at the 95% confidence level .",
    "it is possible that this count rate variability is accompanied by or even due to changes in the x - ray spectrum of the source .",
    "if true , the spectral results we obtained in   [ subsubsection : spectral_0929 ] only represent a time - averaged view of the spectral properties of the source . to investigate if indeed xte j0929314 exhibited spectral variability we calculated x - ray hardness ratios from the first part of the observation ( between 0 and 10 ksec after the start of the observation ; 13 photons were detected in this time interval ) and the second part of the observation ( the remaining @xmath014 ksec of the observation ; 9 photons were detected ) . as x - ray hardness ratio we used the logarithm of the ratio between the number of photons detected with energies @xmath131 kev and the number of photons detected with energies @xmath331 kev .",
    "in figure  [ fig : quantile ] ( _ top panel _ ) we show the hardness ratio versus time . during the second part of the observation",
    "the hardness ratio is smaller than during the first part , but the error bars are large and the data are consistent with a non - variable spectrum .",
    "hong , schlegel , & grindlay ( 2004 ) have argued that the x - ray hardness ratios normally used in the literature ( e.g. , those we used in the previous paragraph ) are not appropriate for sources with low numbers of counts .",
    "since we have roughly 10 counts to construct our hardness ratios , these ratios might not represent an accurate description of the spectral shape of xte j0929314 .",
    "therefore , we also calculate so - called `` quantiles '' using the quantile method outlined by hong et al .",
    "hong et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the quantity @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the median quantile , provided a good indication for the spectral hardness of a source .",
    "therefore , in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : quantile ] we plot this quantity as a function of time .",
    "similar to the hardness ratios , the error bars on the quantiles are such that a constant spectral shape throughout the observation can not be excluded .    as a last way of investigating possible spectral variability",
    ", we extracted the x - ray spectrum for each of the two time intervals used above .",
    "the results of the spectral fitting are listed in table  [ tab : variability ] .",
    "when fitting the two data sets separately , a power - law model produces acceptable fits ( with fit quality of 0.60.7 ) with photon indices of 1.3@xmath46 and 2.6@xmath47 for the first and second part of the observation , respectively .",
    "the values again indicate that the source spectrum had softened during the course of the observation , although the indices are consistent with each other ( within the errors ) .",
    "the 0.510 kev x - ray flux decreased by a factor of 34 during the observation indeed suggesting variability in the brightness of the source ( note , again the errors are large and only minimal variability might have been present ) . to further investigate how significant the softening of the x - ray spectrum is , we fitted the two data sets simultaneously . during this fit",
    ", we assumed that the column density did not vary during the observation and we tied it between the two data sets .",
    "the fit results were consistent with those obtained when fitting the data sets separately ( tab .",
    "[ tab : variability ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : contour ] we plot the confidence regions of the photon indices , showing that the two indices are only different from each other at the @xmath3390% confidence level .",
    "this is illustrated in the figure by the line of equal index between two data sets which intersects the 90% confidence contour .",
    "we conclude that the limited statistics does not allow for any strong conclusions on the possible softening of the x - ray spectrum suggested by figure  [ fig : energy - curve ] .",
    "we investigated if a thermal model could fit the two data sets , but when using a nsa model with fixed normalization ( to a distance of 5 , 10 , or 15 kpc ) , the fit qualities were always 1.00 for the first part of the observation and between 0.89 and 0.94 ( larger for smaller assumed distance ) for the second part of the observation .",
    "also a simple black - body model does not produce a good fit with fit qualities of 0.85 and 0.87 for the first and second part of the observation , respectively .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that during the whole observation , the source had an x - ray spectral shape which was significantly different ( i.e. , harder ) from a simple thermal model .",
    "this confirms our conclusions in ",
    "[ subsubsection : spectral_0929 ] .",
    "investigations into whether or not the fractional contribution of the power - law component to the 0.510 kev flux changed during the observation did not result in useful insights due to the limitation on the statistics of the individual data sets .",
    "we begin a similar analysis for xte j1751305 by searching for point sources in our data ( using wavdetect ) .",
    "we detected 34 sources in our image but xte j1751305 itself was not detected ( a discussion of the properties of these 34 sources , unrelated to xte j1751305 , is beyond the scope of this article ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : image_1751 ] we show the 0.57 kev x - ray image near the position of xte j1751305 .",
    "several point sources are detected close to the position of xte j1751305 ( obtained during outburst using _ chandra _ ; markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ) , but only 1 photon was detected ( in the energy range 0.57 kev ) in a circle with a radius of 1@xmath20 around the position of xte j1751305 ( for _ chandra _ s point - spread - function , 1@xmath20 corresponds to the encirclement of 90% of the energy ) , which does not constitute a significant detection .",
    "when using also the data at lower energies ( i.e. , using the energy range 0.37.0 kev ) , we still could only detect 2 photons within an 1@xmath20 radius . when using a larger radius of 1.5@xmath20 ,",
    "3 photons are detected for the energy range 0.57 kev , and 5 photons for the energy range 0.37 kev .",
    "however , in these cases more than half the possible source photons would fall outside the circle which should encircle @xmath1390% of the energy , which is unlikely .",
    "moreover , the positions of the two softest photons ( those with energies @xmath330.45 kev ) were consistent with the position of a bright @xmath48 star close to the position of xte j1751305 ( 1.2@xmath20 away ; the two photons have a distance of 0.5@xmath20 and 0.8@xmath20 from the position of this star ) .",
    "thus these two photons could have possibly originated from this star and not from xte j1751305 , especially because the high column density toward the pulsar ( @xmath0@xmath49 @xmath5 ; miller et al .",
    "2003 ) would make unlikely any detection of its photons which have energies below 0.5 kev .",
    "the closest , significantly detected x - ray source ( the one to the south - east of xte j1751305 ) is located 3.8@xmath20 away , declination @xmath50 .",

    "our analysis strongly suggests that the positional accuracy of our x - ray image is within the standard accuracy quoted for _ chandra_. therefore , we conclude that xte j1751305 was not conclusively detected during our _ chandra _ observation .    to calculate a flux upper limit for xte j1751305 , we assume that @xmath335 photons ( for the energy range 0.57 kev ) were detected from the source , resulting in a count rate upper limit of 1.16 @xmath53 counts s@xmath2 ( 0.57 kev ) .",
