    "determination of the various fundamental parameters of hadron from experimental data requires information about physics at large distance .",

    "both sum rules yield the @xmath6 coupling close to its experimental value , while the @xmath7 sum rules contain large contributions from the continuum and for this reason its predictions are not reliable .",

    "the sum rules for the f / d ratio for general form of baryon currents for above mentioned three different dirac structures in the framework of traditional sum rules is studied in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to study f / d ratio in the framework of an alternative approach to the traditional sum rules , namely light cone qcd sum rules(lcqsr ) and compare the predictions of these different approaches .",
    "lcqsr is based on the operator product expansion on the light cone , which is an expansion over the twists of the operators rather than the dimensions in the traditional sum rules and the main contribution comes from the lowest twist operators .",

( 33 - 36 ) and ( 40 - 41 ) ) , are the pion wave functions . in @xcite , a theoretical framework has been developed to study these functions . the leading twist 2 pion wave function can be expressed as an expansion in gegenbauer polynomials @xmath89",
    "@xcite : _ ( u ) = 6 u ( 1-u ) [ expansion ] the coefficients @xmath90 renormalize multiplicatively . on the basis of the approximate conformal symmetry of qcd , it has been shown in @xcite that the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) converges sufficiently fast so that terms with @xmath91 are negligible .    in the calculations",
    "we have used the following forms of the wavefunctions appearing in the meson matrix elements ( see e.g. @xcite for more details ) : _ ( u,)&=&6u|u  , + _ ( u ) & = & 6 u ( 1-u ) + _ p(u)&= & 1+b_2(3(2 u-1)^2 - 1 ) + b_4 ( 35(2 u-1)^4 + & & -30(2 u-1)^2 + 3 )  , + g_1(u)&=&2 ^ 2 ( 1-u)^2u^2+^2 [ ( 1-u ) u(2 + 13(1-u)u)+10 u^3u(2 - 3u+ u^2 ) + & & + 10 ( 1-u)^3(1-u)(2 - 3(1-u)+ ( 1-u)^2 ) ]  , + g_2(u ) & = & ^2 u ( 1-u ) ( 2 u -1 ) + _ ( _ i ) & = & 120 ^ 2 ( _ 1-_2)_1_2_3 + _ ( _ i ) & = & 10 ^2 ( _ 1 - _ 2 ) _ 3 ^ 2 + _ ( _ i ) & = & - 40 ^2 _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 + _ ( _ i ) & = & 10 ^2 ( 1-_3 ) _ 3 ^ 2 + _ 3 ( _ i ) & = & 360 _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 ^ 2 where @xmath92 is defined by matrix element : g_s |q g _ ^q 0 = i ^2 f_q _ . and @xmath93 the additional parameters appearing in the above are numerically given by @xmath94 which corresponds to choosing the renormalization scale at @xmath95 .    in our calculations , we set @xmath96 since the initial and final baryons are identical , which corresponds to setting @xmath97 .",
    "hence , in the sum rules , only the value of the wavefunctions at the symmetry point @xmath98 are needed .",
    "the values of the other input parameters appearing in the sum rules are : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 @xcite , @xmath103 @xcite , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    in figs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we present the dependence of @xmath106 on the borel mass @xmath107 at three different values of @xmath1 , namely @xmath108 , @xmath109 as well as @xmath33 which corresponds to the ioffe current for the structures @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively . the continuum threshold is chosen to be @xmath110 corresponding to the roper resonance . to analyze the sensitivity of the sum rules to the continuum threshold",
    ", we also plotted the results for the value @xmath111 . from these figures we obtained that the working region for the borel mass is @xmath112 .",
    "also we see that the tensor structure @xmath13 is more stable with respect to variations of the borel mass and also the variations of the continuum threshold for all curves .",
    "for example at @xmath113 , the results are practically independent of @xmath80 and @xmath1 .",
    "the results change about @xmath114 for the structure @xmath13 with variations of @xmath80 and @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the results obtained from the structure @xmath115 are less reliable .    in figs ( 3 ) and ( 4 )",
    ", the dependence of @xmath116 on the parameter @xmath1 at @xmath113 and at @xmath110 is presented for the structures @xmath117 and @xmath13 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath118 are physical parameters and hence it should not depend on the arbitrary parameter @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath28 s are the same for all baryons due to the @xmath0 symmetry , one expects the graphs to be just multiples of one another .",
    "the results obtained from the structure @xmath115 are far from satisfying this criteria . on the other hand the results obtained form the @xmath13 structure",
    "are all zero at @xmath119 similar to the traditional sum rules(see @xcite ) but the second zero position is different for different coupling constants . note that the region @xmath120 is unphysical since in this region the mass sum rules yields a negative value for @xmath121 @xcite . as we see from fig .",
    "4 , for each sum rule , this unphysical region becomes wider and contains the region between the two zeroes , since the sign of @xmath122 should be the same as the sign of @xmath123 , hence it should not change . from these figures also",
    "one is led to the conclusion that the predictions of the @xmath115 structure is not as reliable as the predictions of the @xmath13 structure in constructing sum rules .    in fig",
    "( 5 ) , the dependence of the f / d ratio for the above mentioned structures on @xmath124 is presented . here",
    ", @xmath125 is defined as @xmath126 and only the physical region for the parameter @xmath125 is shown . from these figures",
    ", it follows that for the tensor structure , the ratio @xmath86 is practically independent on the continuum threshold , but for the @xmath127 structure , it has a strong dependence on @xmath80 . for this reason , prediction for the @xmath86 ratio from the tensor structure is more reliable .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath86 ration on the borel parameter @xmath107 also turns out to be very weak .",
    "being a physical parameter , the f / d ratio should be independent of @xmath128 . from the figure",
    ", we see that f / d is quite stable ( for the tensor structure ) in the region @xmath129 .",
    "this region is also away from the unphysical region for @xmath1 . in this region , we obtain the result @xmath130 .",
    "note that @xmath131 quark model predict @xmath132 .",
    "analysis of semileptonic decay of hyperons give @xmath133 @xcite and the traditional sum rules yield @xmath134 @xcite . within errors our results are in a good agreement with all existing results .",
