    "an  region spectrum coupled with deep balmer absorption lines indicates that the stellar population of ngc 3073 is very young .",
    "filippenko & sargent ( 1992 and references therein ) postulate that the copious star formation observed in ngc 3073 might have been triggered by the super - wind from ngc 3079 ( see above ) , which , in projection , points in the direction of ngc 3073 . from these observations",
    "it has been speculated by irwin et al . that a hot inter - galaxy medium may be present in this group that might be observable in x - rays .",
    "ngc  3079 was detected as an x - ray source by the einstein observatory ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1982 , 1992 ) with a luminosity of @xmath19   in the 0.54 kev range ( corrected to a distance of 17.8 kpc and for galactic foreground absorption of @xmath20@xmath12 , and assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with a temperature of 5 kev ) .",

    "in this paper we present rosat hri observation of ngc  3079 and a detailed reanalysis of the rosat pspc data extracted from the rosat archive .",
    "ngc  3079 was observed from october 20 to 25 , 1992 with the rosat hri and from november 13 to 15 , 1991 with the rosat pspc , for a total observing time of 20.7 ks ( hri ) and 19.0 ks ( pspc ) .",
    "the observations were split into 11 and 9 observation intervals ( obis ) for hri and pspc , respectively . to analyse the data for times of high detector background , we investigated rates of the master veto rate counter for the pspc and the invalid counts for the hri integrated over 60 s. the rates reach maxima of 280 cts s@xmath22 ( 82 cts s@xmath22 ) , but stay below 200 cts s@xmath22 ( 60 cts s@xmath22 ) for 98% ( 99% ) of the time for the pspc ( hri ) .",
    "we therefore decided not to reject events due to times of high background .      to improve on the attitude solution we have adopted two subsequent techniques . for the hri data we analyzed individual obis and aligned the data with the help of 7 bright point sources ( namely h1 , h2 , h8 , h9 , h15 , h20 , h23 , cp .",

    "while the offset in the position of these sources was @xmath233  for most obis , for obi 5 the offset was @xmath2412 .",
    "the photons were corrected for the offsets .",
    "we also looked for possible optical counterparts ( see appendix a.1 and a.2 ) with the aid of apm finding charts ( irwin 1994 ) , and compared the optical and x - ray positions , to determine a possible systematic error on the absolute attitude solution .",
    "we found optical candidates for 9 sources in the hri and 7 in the pspc .",
    "we determined a systematic shift of 34 to the east and 39 to the north and an additional counterclockwise rotation of 039 for the hri observation .",
    "the corrected center of the hri pointing direction is @xmath14 = @xmath25 ,   @xmath26 ( j2000.0 ) . for the pspc",
    ", we determined a shift of 88 to the east and 65 to the south and an additional counterclockwise rotation of 02 .",

    "source lists and images have been corrected for these systematic effects .",
    "the remaining position uncertainty is less than 3  for both instruments .",
    "the attitude corrections determined above for hri and pspc are in good agreement with boresight parameters determined from a larger sample of observations that now are used for the sass re - processing ( m. krster , private communication ) .      for the pspc data",

    "snowden et al .",
    "1994 ) , corrected for exposure , vignetting , and dead time and smoothed with a gaussian filter having a fwhm corresponding to the on - axis point spread function ( psf ) of that particular energy band .",
    "the fwhm values used range from 52  to 24 .",
    "the average background was calculated from a source free region to the north of ngc  3079 .    for the hri , contour plots have been obtained from images with 25 bin size which were corrected for dead time and smoothed with a 12  fwhm gaussian filter . to reduce the background due to uv emission or cosmic rays we used only those events detected in the hri raw pulse height amplitude channels 28 .",
    "the resulting images are discussed in sect .",
    "we performed source detection and position determination with the exsas local detect , map detect , and maximum likelihood algorithms ( zimmermann et al .",
    "1992 ) . maximum likelihood values ( @xmath29 ) can be converted into probabilities ( @xmath30 ) through @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 corresponds to a gaussian significance of about 3.6@xmath33 and @xmath34 corresponds to a gaussian significance of about 3.9@xmath33 ( cruddace et al .",

    "this range of temperature and models , the resulting values change by @xmath23 15% .",
    "different considerations were applied to the hri and the pspc data to better suit the properties of these instruments .",
    "hri : sources were searched for in the inner @xmath42 diameter circle about the field s center .",
    "again , we used only those events detected in the hri raw pulse height amplitude channels 28 ( see sect .",
    "sources with a @xmath43 were accepted .",
    "pspc : sources were searched for in the inner @xmath44  field centered on ngc  3079 in the five standard rosat energy bands : `` broad '' ( 0.12.4  kev ) , `` soft '' ( 0.10.4 kev ) , `` hard '' ( 0.52.0  kev ) , `` hard1 '' ( 0.50.9  kev ) , and `` hard2 '' ( 0.92.0  kev ) .",
    "sources for which we obtained @xmath45 in at least one of the bands were considered .",
    "we have used a slightly higher l value than in the hri analysis since for the pspc we are already getting background limited .",
    "once the existence of the source is established , its position is determined from the band with the highest @xmath29 value .",
    "this is then used to derive the net counts in the five standard bands defined above in an aperture corresponding to @xmath46fwhm of the energy band considered .",
    "the background is always taken from the same area in the corresponding background map ( see exsas manual , zimmermann et al .",
    "these values are used to calculate hardness ratios and their corresponding errors : hr1 = ( hard  soft)/(hard+soft ) and hr2 = ( hard2hard1)/(hard2+hard1 ) , where all of the quantities are corrected for the appropriate vignetting correction ( see exsas manual ) .",
    "if the source is not detected in one of the four bands , however , the corresponding hardness ratio can not be simply calculated .",
    "we have therefore modified the algorithm , and determined to compute the hardness ratio using the 2@xmath33 upper limit instead of the net counts , when the signal - to - noise ratio in a particular band is less than 2 .",
    "this allows us to estimate a maximum or minimum value that the hardness ratio can have . when both quantities are upper limits no hardness ratio is calculated .",
    "hardness ratios can be used to have a crude estimate of the spectral parameters that best apply to the energy distribution of the source photons , when the statistics do not allow a more detailed analysis . to show this we have also calculated  theoretical \" hardness ratios from the spectral distribution of some standard spectral models ( @xmath47 raymond & smith , power law and thermal bremsstrahlung ) with a low energy cut - off .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ hr - theor ] , and can be used as a comparison to the observed values of hr1 and hr2 ( see sects . [ spectra - anal ] and appendix a.1 ) .",
    "a grey scale plot of the @xmath48  hri field is shown in fig .  [ image_hri ] .",
    "hri sources found by the detection algorithms ( see sec .  2.2 and 3.2 ) are marked with their hri number and a ellipse sketches the d@xmath9 ( see table [ parameters ] ) .",
    "figure  [ image_pspc ] shows a contour map of the @xmath49  pspc field centered on ngc  3079 .",
    "the positions of all individual sources detected are marked , with their pspc number .",
    "note that p20 is detected only in the hard band , and does not appear in the broad - band map .",
    "the ellipse sketches the d@xmath9 .    a smaller portion of the hri field corresponding to the area of the extended emission seen with the pspc is presented in fig .  [ master_hri_center ] .",
    "the hri spatial resolution resolves the emission from the galaxy s plane into a structure at the center and three individual sources , but is not sensitive enough to show the low surface brightness emission at large galactocentric radii .",
    "figure  [ opt_hi_pspc ] ( see sect .",
    "4 ) shows the inner part of the pspc field superposed onto the optical image of the galaxy .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the emission from ngc3079 is complex and extends both above and below the galaxy s plane .",
    "we have also produced maps of the emission in different energy ranges ( fig .",
    "[ four_in_one ] ) , namely in the soft , hard1 and hard2 bands defined above .",
    "as can be seen by the comparisons of the iso - intensity contour maps , the softer and harder emission show rather different morphologies .",
    "the hard2 band emission is aligned with the optical disk of the galaxy , and seems to be rather confined to it , while both the hard1 and the soft images show extensions above and below the plane .",
    "this difference can not be attributed to the different response of the instrument in the different energy bands and indicates the presence of more than one component to the emission of ngc 3079 ( see discussion later ) .",

    "similar plots in the soft and hard band indicate maximum radii of comparable values . in the hri",
    ", the profile flattens at a radius r @xmath101 ( 10 kpc ) . for the hri",

[ opt_hi_pspc ] ) , we have further analyzed the pspc data by looking at the radial distribution of photons in different directions and in comparison to the expected pure field background , whose shape is represented by the exposure map .",
    "in fact , while the background map is constructed from the data and therefore takes partially into account any diffuse emission present in the field , the exposure map should represent the pspc response to a flat , constant radiation , while taking into account both exposure and vignetting . when properly normalized to the data , the expected field background can therefore be estimated from it ( see also trinchieri et al .",

    "the normalization of the exposure map is determined at 8  to 10  offset from the galaxy .",

    "the extent along the major axis ( @xmath1325  corresponding to 12.5 kpc to both sides of the nucleus ) is similar to the optical ( about the corrected d@xmath9 ) .",
    "if the x - ray emission only originated from the galaxy disk , given the galaxy s inclination one would expect a @xmath231  extent to both sides of the nucleus along the minor axis .",

    "is detected out to @xmath106 ( 30 kpc ) , while only a marginal excess is seen at distances greater than 25 ( 12.5 kpc ) in the eastern direction .",
    "we can quantify this excess by noticing that @xmath107 net excess counts are found in the region from 25  6  in the western direction , significantly higher than the expected contribution from the single source p13 ( @xmath108 counts , from table  [ sources_pspc ] ) and also much more extended than expected from a single point - like source . while with the present data we can not exclude that p13 is indeed an individual source , the excess found points towards interpreting it as a local enhancement onto a somewhat irregular emission .",
    "no optical counterpart can be seen in the finding charts ( see appendix a.2 ) .",
    "the excess in the east is @xmath109 net excess counts . for comparison",

    "asymmetries and irregularities in the emission are also found on smaller scales . outside of the nuclear area ,",
    "an almost x - shaped emission ( the arm to the se of the major axis is not as evident as the others ) is detected , as indicated rather irregular azimuthal surface brightness distribution outside of the nuclear area shown in fig .",
    "in particular , there are two enhancements relative to neighboring sectors at @xmath112 from the major axis , and clear depressions in the direction almost perpendicular to the major axis ( @xmath113 and 270@xmath114 in fig .",

    "[ ew ] , where the comparison with the psf is also shown , there is a suggestion for the presence of an unresolved source embedded in a more extended component , and a significantly steeper decline in the western half of the plane than the eastern half .",
    "however , the point - source component does not dominate in the inner 20@xmath115 radius region , so any attempt to study it at the pspc resolution is hampered by the presence of the extended component .",
    "the morphology of the emission from ngc  3079 , coupled with its optical and  properties , suggests that the x - ray emission comes from three separate regions with presumably very different characteristics .",
    "the bright central region ( 60  diameter ) , resolved in a complex source plus 2 point - like sources by the hri , is likely to experience a large absorption .",
    "similarly , the emission from the disk , seen edge - on , will be heavily absorbed , with the exception of the very external layers . in the halo region , instead , absorption consistent with the line of sight  column density from our own galaxy is expected . a possible difference between the two sides of the plane , as the galaxy is not perfectly edge - on , might also be expected .",
    "in addition , inter - galaxy gas within the group ( see introduction ) may add additional absorption .",
    "given the limited statistics offered by the pspc data , we have tried to minimize the number of separate regions from which to extract the photons for spectral analysis purposes .",

    "rough errors for the fluxes and luminosities in table  [ spec ] are indicated by the statistical errors on the net counts ( see table  [ spec - tab ] , although additional uncertainties come from the poor knowledge of the spectrum , as can be seen by simply comparing the fluxes derived for different models ) .",
    "it is apparent that in all cases but the halo region , power law and thermal bremsstrahlung models give a better approximation of the data than the thin plasma model ( raymond - smith code ) .",

    "the fact that we have obtained very similar results from the disk and central regions is not surprising since , as already remarked above , the extended emission contributes significantly even at small radii , and this , combined with the extremely poor statistical significance of the data , does not allow us to distinguish the presence of a different component ( for example from the point source in the nuclear region suggested by the hri data ) .    even though a good fit is already obtained for power law and thermal bremsstrahlung models , for the galaxy as a whole we have also tried to improve on the best fit values in the thin thermal plasma model by assuming two temperatures .",
    "this is done mostly to compare ours with published results on similar objects , and it is partly justified by the fact that the requirement of a lower - than - galactic absorbing column in the 1-temperature fit could be suggestive of an additional very soft component .",
    "indeed we find best fit values of kt@xmath163 and kt@xmath164 kev , for a the minimum @xmath161 reduced to an acceptable value of 5.3 ( for 4 degrees of freedom ) and the best fit n@xmath165 consistent with the galactic value .",
    "the halo region can not be fit by any of the simple models ( @xmath47 the minimum @xmath166 value is larger than 2 in all cases ) . in spite of the limited significance of our procedure , we have nevertheless tried to fit the data with both a two - component model ( @xmath47 two bremsstrahlung models and a bremsstrahlung and a thin plasma model ) and with a thin plasma model with varying abundances . in both cases",
    "the minimum @xmath161 value reduces drastically to perfectly acceptable values ( 1.5 and 2.2 ) and the best fit values are kt 0.2 and 1 kev ( 2-t model ) and kt 0.5 kev , 5% solar abundance . while it is therefore possible that more sophisticated models might be required for this region , given the limited statistical significance of the data , we can not discriminate between different scenarios , nor can we be sure that our more sophisticated modeling of the data is correct , since we are left with 1 or 2 degrees of freedom . since the resulting fluxes that we can derive with the different best fit models are all very similar ( see table [ spec ] ) , we will therefore assume the best fit values from the thin thermal plasma model for counts to flux conversion purposes for the halo emission .",

    "the lower limit sign is due to the fact that the absorption in the nucleus is likely to be much higher than the value assumed ( which corresponds to an average column density in the disk on ngc  3079 , see  maps ( irwin & seaquist 1991 ) and best fit parameters from spectral fits ) . while a different choice of the spectral model would give very similar values ( see table  [ spec ] ) , the low energy absorption adopted influences very strongly the estimate of the intrinsic flux in the rosat band .",

    "1998 ; dahlem et al . 1998 ) ; therefore , due to the lack of good spatial resolution at high energies , it can either be related to the nuclear activity or to the binary population and starburst phenomenon ( or both ) .",

    "two explanations for the enhanced x - ray luminosity of ngc 3079 can be put forward that are triggered by anomalies of the galaxy measured in other wavelength regimes :    1 .",
    "the galaxy belongs to a group of powerful far infrared emitters , with a far infrared excess comparable to that of starburst galaxies like m82 , ngc 253 , and ngc 2146 ( lehnert & heckman 1995 ) . in fact the x - ray , optical and far infrared luminosities of ngc 3079 and ngc 2146 are almost identical ( armus et al .",
    "as we discuss later similarities of the galaxies do not stop there .",
    "it is therefore likely that enhanced star formation activity is not only present in the nuclear area but rather widespread in the disk , and therefore it is not remarkable that the x - ray luminosity is also enhanced .",
    "2 .   on the other hand ngc 3079 harvests a low ionization nuclear emission line region ( liner ) or seyfert 2 type nucleus ( heckman 1980 , ford et al .",

    "1994 , ehle et al .",
    "1995 , read et al .",
    "this makes it conceivable that jet - like outflows from active nuclei might indicate enhanced extended x - ray emission .    while it is not clear which of these types of activity ( or even both ? ) is responsible for the enhanced x - ray emission , both may have been triggered by galaxy galaxy encounters in the ngc  3079 galaxy group that also contains ngc 3073 and mcg 9 - 17 - 9 ( see sect .",
    "[ group ] ) .    the low x - ray flux associated with ngc 3079 has not allowed us to properly measure the spectral characteristics of the emission components , therefore a physical interpretation of the results is not possible . as shown in sect .",
    "3.3.2 , a power law model with relatively steep spectral index or a soft thermal bremsstrahlung could fit the data equally well .",
    "however , the power law index is in all cases very steep ( @xmath184 ) and also the temperature of the thermal bremsstrahlung spectra is rather low if we compare them for instance with spectral fits to individual x - ray binaries or the integral bulge spectrum ( primarily x - ray binaries ) found with the rosat pspc for m31 ( @xmath185 or temperatures above @xmath186 kev , supper et al .",
    "it is likely that the simple models that we have assumed here for lack of statistics are inadequate to represent the more complex characteristics of the x - ray emission in these objects ( for example a population of individual sources plus a multitemperature or non - equilibrium interstellar medium ) .",
    "dahlem et al . (",
    "1998 ) have shown that a correct interpretation of the spectra of galaxies requires data in a larger energy range than provided by the pspc data alone , even though there are still residual ambiguities in the correct model to be used .",
    "in particular they find in several instances that two gas phases are needed in addition to a power law component at high energies .",
    "the lack of spatial resolution however does not allow a proper investigation of the location of these individual components , that can not therefore be unambiguously identified with the separate sources of emission in galaxies . in this respect , only future x - ray missions , that combine high sensitivity with good spectral and spatial resolution over a large energy range will allow a significant step forward in our understanding of the x - ray properties of galaxies . from the present data",
    "however we could be tempted to assume that indeed a multiphase interstellar medium is present and interpret the ( very crude ) indication of the hardness ratios in terms of temperature variations in the disk versus central region , and assign a higher temperature to the emission coming from the central source coincident with the super - bubble ( see sect .",
    ". this would be analogous to the results from the more detailed analysis of ngc  253 , for which the central starbursting region is harder than the surrounding disk ( dahlem et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in either case",
    "however a large low energy absorption is suggested , well above the line - of - sight  column density .",
    "this result is not surprising since the disk is embedded in an extended  disk ( irwin et al .",
    "1987 ) . only at large distances from the plane",
    "could local obscuration be neglected , and indeed the ( though extremely uncertain ) results for the halo region do not require large absorbing columns .",
    "several bright sources are detected in the galaxy plane of ngc 3079 ( table  [ n3079_sources ] ) , with luminosities higher than 10@xmath187 , @xmath47 well above the eddington luminosity for a 1 m@xmath188 accreting object .",
    "as already discussed , these could be real point - like sources or could be local enhancements in a more diffuse emission .",

    "the integral spectrum of the disk region is rather soft compared to bright x - ray binary spectra and can be taken to favor the over - luminous  region origin of the emission .",
    "deep observations with improved spatial and spectral resolution are needed to solve the origin of the disk emission .",
    "ngc 3079 hosts the most powerful example of a wind - blown bubble to the east of its nucleus .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies in the near infrared and optical however argue against a starburst origin for the powering of the wind , and suggest an active nucleus with somewhat exceptional properties ( hawarden et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this case",
    ", one would expect a wind from an active galactic nucleus ( agn , see heckman et al .",
    "1986 )  how can x - ray observations help understanding the nature of this source ?",

    "1986 ) and the kiloparsec scale radio lobes ( de bruyn 1977 , duric & seaquist 1988 ) is clearly detected in the hri data .",
    "the source appears complex ( see fig .",
    "[ halpha_hri ] ) . a possible unresolved component , apparently shifted by about 3  to the east from the position of the optical nucleus ( marked by the cross in fig .  [ halpha_hri ] ) could be  within the systematic position errors  coincident with the nucleus .",
    "this source , if identified with the hard spectral component measured by asca ( see discussion in sect .",
    "3.4 ) that has been associated with the emission of an highly absorbed agn , is brighter by a factor of 3  4 than the extrapolation of the asca spectrum into the rosat band would suggest .",
    "if the positional displacement however is real , it could represent the brightest and hottest part of the out - flowing material that is not shielded by the absorbing material in the central disk .",
    "such a displacement to the east is expected in such a scenario due to the high absorption in the inner disk of ngc  3079 and the disk orientation .",
    "the inclination of 84and the orientation of the galaxy ( the western side of the disk is closer to us than the eastern side ) lead to reduced absorption in the direction to the nuclear area in the east and high absorption in the west ( n@xmath10 in the inner disk is @xmath191 @xmath12 according to irwin & seaquist 1991 ) .",
    "the high absorption may also cause that no x - ray or h@xmath14 emission coinciding with the western component of the radio jet is detected .    a more extended component elongated to the north is possibly connected to a feature seen at larger scale ( fig .",
    "[ halpha_hri ] ) , and may indicate a preferred channel to fuel the emission in the halo .",
    "the hri attitude solution carefully derived in sect .",
    "2.1 clearly contradicts the solution put forward by dahlem et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which is shifted to the north by 15  and  if correct  would exclude a connection of the central x - ray emission with either the nucleus or the nuclear super - bubble of ngc 3079 .",
    "the small extension of the bright central x - ray emission region compared to the pspc spatial resolution coupled with it s low flux prevents us from reliably determining spectral properties . in the innermost 30@xmath51 radius ,",
    "that correspond to the minimum cell size for count extraction that is reasonable for pspc data , the hri resolution indicates that at least three different components are present , all contributing to the overall emission : the disk with two non nuclear point - like sources , the nuclear bubble and the unresolved point source .",
    "neither of these dominates , with the possible exception of the disk emission , which can in part be subtracted by choosing a local background ( see table  [ spec - tab ] ) , and therefore a spectral analysis should take all of them into account .",
    "this is clearly unrealistic given the small number of photons that can be collected in the area and also given the limited spectral capabilities of the pspc , that indeed indicate a single model as acceptable .",
    "whether one can however use the results of any such fit and interpret them as giving a physical interpretation of the observations remains questionable .",
    "observations with better statistics and higher spectral and spatial resolution and an extension to higher energies are needed badly .",
    "only then will we be able to answer the question if the  with rosat hri  unresolved component 3to the east of the optical nucleus is coincident with the optical nucleus and the hard asca source ( see above ) or  our prefered explanation  the brightest and hottest part of the out - flowing material .",

    "they find a luminosity that is higher by a factor of @xmath208 and nearly twice the temperature compared to the halo parameters as given in table [ spec ] ; _ i.e. _ their values mix up halo and disk , leading to higher electron densities and gas masses , and slightly longer cooling times .",
    "read et al .",
    "analyzed several nearby spiral galaxies using similar simplified models .",
    "the resulting parameters for the diffuse gas always overestimate a possible halo component preventing a sensible comparison to the ngc  3079 halo results .    as mentioned above to derive the gas parameters we assumed a spherical distribution with constant temperature .",
    "this approximation however , only describes the situation to first order .",
    "at least two further details indicated by the rosat data should be addressed :    * there is a clear e ",
    "w asymmetry ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ rad_maj_min ] ) and an indication of a x - shape azimuthal distribution in the pspc broad band counts that will be further discussed below . *",
    "the pspc contour plots of the s band emission of ngc  3079 show far more azimuthal structure than the more spherically distributed h1 band emission .",
    "this indicates local variations of the halo x - ray spectrum indicative of either changing foreground or intrinsic ( within the halo of ngc  3079 ) absorption and/or temperature variations within the halo gas .    to better understand and characterize these effects spatially resolved spectra",
    "are strongly needed which , due to the low counting statistics , can not be tackled with the rosat data at present .",
    "temperature profiles of the diffuse emission will help to solve the question of whether the e  w asymmetry can be attributed to inhomogeneities in the galaxy halo or instead it reflects a hot medium connected to the potential of the ngc  3079 group ( or both components could be present ) .",
    "this question is also relevant when interpreting  data of the companion galaxy ngc  3073 which exhibit an elongated tail aligned with the nucleus of ngc  3079 ; an explanation of the tail due to ram pressure stripping by out - flowing gas from ngc  3079 has been put forward in favor of stripping by movement in an intergroup medium ( irwin et al .",
    "a galactic wind perpendicular to the disk in the general direction of the minor axis can explain the x - shaped halo structure of the x - ray and optical data ( see above ) .      the unified model for active nuclei ( antonucci 1993 ) has been proposed to explain the properties of the different types of agn . in this scheme the difference between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies is determined by the viewing angle to the nucleus that is embedded in a torus of molecular material .",
    "type 1 seyfert galaxies allow direct observation of the nucleus , whereas for type 2 galaxies nuclear x - ray emission can only be seen via reflection above or below the torus or dust gains , or via transmission through this torus .",
    "x - ray spectra of the nuclear emission are directly probing the absorption depth under which an agn is seen , and therefore are an important test for the unified scheme .    as discussed in sects .",
    "3.4 and 4.2 , only very little direct emission from the liner / seyfert 2 type nucleus of ngc  3079  if any at all  is detected in the rosat band . due to the many different equally bright components that contribute to the overall x - ray spectrum of ngc  3079 and due to limited counting statistics , integral spectra of the galaxy as obtained by asca can not fully separate the nuclear emission component and only give an indication of a highly absorbed power law component that could be related to the nucleus .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy with high spatial resolution as expected from the next generation of x - ray observatories ( axaf , xmm ) will resolve the ambiguity . from mm - wave estimates of the extinction to the nucleus of ngc  3079 ( sofue & irwin 1992 ) and by comparison with integral broad band x - ray spectra of other seyfert 2 galaxies obtained with the asca or bepposax satellites",
    "( see maiolino et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) one may infer absorption depths well in excess of 10@xmath209 @xmath12 also for ngc  3079 .    soft x - ray emission in excess of the high energy spectrum has been discovered in many seyfert 2 galaxies . in seyfert 1",
    "galaxies such a component may not be observed because it is covered by the bright low absorbed flat power law spectrum . in the nearby seyfert 2",

    ". such a source could be a low luminosity active nucleus , a x - ray binary radiating at super - eddington luminosity , a young supernova or a combination of the above .",

    "the active nucleus may contribute to the emission as a point source . we , however , prefer an explanation of this emission as the brightest and hottest part of the out - flowing material similar to the slightly extended emission emission close to the galaxy nucleus within the plume of ngc  253 ( pietsch et al .",

    "the x - ray luminosity of ngc  3079 is higher by a factor of 10 compared to other galaxies of similar optical luminosity .",
    "it also exceeds the luminosity seen in starburst galaxies like ngc  253 .",

[ observations ] ) , the assumption of a wrong spectral model should not cause these flux differences .",
    "however , it should be noted that two of these sources , h1/p3 and h5/p7 , are at large off - axis angles , so possible effects due to their positioning in the detector might come into play .",
