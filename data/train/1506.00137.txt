    "point processes in time and space have a broad range of applications , in diverse areas such as neuroscience , ecology , finance , astronomy , seismology , and many others .",
    "examples are given in classic textbooks like cox and isham ( 1980 ) , diggle ( 2013 ) , mller and waagepetersen ( 2004 ) , streit ( 2010 ) , and snyder and miller ( 1991 ) , and in the papers cited below .",
    "however , the point - process literature has mostly focused on the single - realization case , such as the distribution of trees in a single forest ( jalilian et al . ,",
    "2013 ) or the distribution of cells in a single tissue sample ( diggle et al . , 2006 ) . but situations where several replications of a process are available are increasingly common . among the few papers proposing statistical methods for replicated point processes we can cite diggle et al .",

    "( 2004 ) , wager et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and pawlas ( 2011 ) .",
    "however , these papers mostly propose estimators for summary statistics of the processes ( the so - called @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 statistics ) rather than for the intensity functions that characterize the processes .",
    "when several replications of a process are available , it is possible to estimate the intensity functions directly thanks to the possibility of borrowing strength  across replications .",
    "this is the basic idea behind many functional data methods that are applied to stochastic processes which , individually , are only sparsely sampled ( james et al . , 2000 ;",
    "yao et al . , 2005 ; gervini , 2009 ) .",
    "functional data analysis has mostly focused on continuous - time processes ; little work has been done on discrete point processes .",
    "we can mention bouzas et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) and fernndez - alcal et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which have rather limited scopes since they only estimate the mean of cox processes , and wu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , who estimate the mean and the principal components of independent and identically distributed realizations of a cox process , but the method of wu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) is based on kernel estimators of the covariance function that are not easily extended beyond i.i.d .",
    "replications and time - dependent processes .",
    "the semiparametric method we propose in this paper , on the other hand , can be applied just as easily to temporal or spatial processes , and can be extended to non - i.i.d .",
    "situations like anova models or more complex data structures like marked point processes and multivariate processes , even though we will not go as far in this paper .    as an example of application we will analyze the spatial distribution of street robberies in chicago in the year 2014 , where each day is seen as a replication of the process .",
    "the method we propose in this paper fits a non - negative independent - component model for the intensity functions , and provides estimators of the intensity functions for the individual replications as by - products .",
    "we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the component estimators in section [ sec : asymptotics ] , study their finite - sample behavior by simulation in section sec : simulations , and analyze the chicago crime data in section sec : example .",
    "a point process @xmath3 is a random countable set in a space @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is usually @xmath5 for temporal processes and @xmath6 or @xmath7 for spatial processes ( mller and waagepetersen , 2004 , ch .  2 ; streit , 2010 , ch .  2 ) .",
    "locally finite processes are those for which @xmath8 with probability one for any bounded @xmath9 . for such processes",

    "single realizations of point processes are often modeled as poisson processes with fixed @xmath34s .",
    "but for replicated point processes a single intensity function @xmath34 rarely provides an adequate fit for all replications .",
    "it is more reasonable to assume that the @xmath34s are subject - specific and treat them as latent random effects .",
    "these processes are called doubly stochastic or cox processes ( mller and waagepetersen , 2004 , ch .  5 ; streit , 2010 , ch .",
    "we can think of a doubly stochastic process as a pair @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a poisson process with intensity @xmath34 , and @xmath37 is a random function that takes values on the space @xmath38 of non - negative locally integrable functions on @xmath4 .",
    "this provides an appropriate framework for the type of applications we have in mind : the @xmath39 replications can be seen as i.i.d .",

    "we will assume that all @xmath42s are observed on a common region @xmath21 of @xmath4 ; the method could be extended to @xmath42s observed on non - conformal regions @xmath43 at the expense of a higher computational complexity .",
    "for many applications we can think of the intensity process @xmath37 as a finite combination of independent components , @xmath44where @xmath45 are functions in @xmath38 and @xmath46 are independent nonnegative random variables .",
    "this is the functional equivalent of the multivariate independent component decomposition ( hyvrinen et al . ,  2001 ) . for identifiability",
    "we assume that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , i.e.  that the @xmath49s are density functions .",
    "then @xmath50 and , if we define @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we have @xmath53the intensity process @xmath54 , then , can be seen as the product of an intensity factor @xmath55 and a scatter factor @xmath56 which is a convex combination of the @xmath49s .",
    "conditionally on @xmath57 the count function @xmath14 has a poisson distribution with rate @xmath58 , and conditionally on @xmath16 the @xmath17 points in @xmath22 are independent identically distributed realizations  with density @xmath59 which is determined by the @xmath60s . in general @xmath55 and @xmath61 are not independent , but if the @xmath62s are assumed to follow independent gamma distributions , say @xmath63 with a common @xmath64 , then @xmath55 and @xmath61 are independent with @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( bilodeau and brenner , 1999 , ch .  3 ) .",
    "the marginal density of @xmath22 , with a slight abuse of notation in writing @xmath67 , can be expressed as @xmath68with @xmath69since @xmath70 is a mixture of the @xmath49s , for computational convenience we introduce indicator vectors @xmath71 such that , for each @xmath72 , @xmath73 for some @xmath48 and @xmath74 for all @xmath75 , with @xmath76 . in words , @xmath77 indicates which @xmath49 the point @xmath78 is coming from .",
    "conditionally on @xmath17 and @xmath79 , the @xmath77s are independent @xmath80 then , collecting all @xmath77s into a single @xmath81 for notational simplicity , ( [ eq : marg_xb ] ) can also be written as @xmath82with @xmath83and @xmath84although the @xmath77s may at first look like an unnecessary complication , they actually simplify the em algorithm and are also useful for data analysis , as we will show in section [ sec : example ] .    to estimate the @xmath49s we use a semiparametric approach : we assume they belong to a family of functions @xmath85 with non - negative basis functions @xmath86 defined on the region of interest @xmath21 ; for example , we can use b - splines for temporal processes and tensor - product splines or radial basis functions for spatial processes .",
    "then @xmath87 with @xmath88 to guarantee that @xmath89 .",
    "note that the specific nature of @xmath90 , i.e.  whether the process is temporal or spatial , only plays a role here , in the specification of @xmath85 ; for all other purposes we make no distinctions between temporal and spatial processes .",
    "the model parameters are estimated by penalized maximum likelihood .",
    "in addition to the component coefficients @xmath91 , the distribution of @xmath55 and @xmath61 will depend on certain parameters that we will collect in a vector @xmath92 . the whole model , then , is parameterized by @xmath93 and the parameter space is @xmath94 , where @xmath95with @xmath96 , and @xmath97  is the space of the @xmath92s .",
    "then , given @xmath39 independent realizations @xmath98 with @xmath99 , the likelihood function is @xmath100with @xmath101 given by ( [ eq : marg_xb ] ) .",
    "since the dimension of @xmath85 is typically large , a roughness penalty has to be added to ( [ eq : data_lik ] ) to obtain smooth @xmath102s .",
    "we use a penalty of the form @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106@xmath107 denotes the hessian and @xmath108 the frobenius matrix norm .",
    "so for a temporal process @xmath109 and for a spatial process @xmath110 , both of which are quadratic functions in the coefficients @xmath111",
    ". then @xmath112 maximizes @xmath113among @xmath114 for a given smoothing parameter @xmath115 .",
    "the smoothing parameter @xmath115 as well as the number of components @xmath116 can be chosen by cross - validation , maximizing @xmath117where @xmath118 denotes the penalized maximum likelihood estimator for the reduced sample with @xmath119 deleted .",
    "an em algorithm for the computation of @xmath112 is described in detail in the supplementary material .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath112 as @xmath120 can be studied via standard empirical - process techniques ( pollard , 1984 ; van der vaart , 2000 ) , since ( [ eq : pen - log - lik ] ) is the average of independent identically distributed functions plus a non - random roughness penalty , as in e.g.  knight and fu ( 2000 ) .    in principle",
    "two types of asymptotics may be of interest : the nonparametric  asymptotics , where the dimension of the basis space @xmath85 grows with @xmath39 , and the parametric  asymptotics , where the true @xmath121s are assumed to belong to @xmath85 and then the dimension of @xmath85 is held fixed .",
    "we will follow the second approach here , which is simpler and sufficient for practical purposes and has been followed by others ( e.g.  yu and ruppert , 2002 , and xun et al . ,",
    "2013 ) in similar semiparametric contexts .    the constraints of the space @xmath122 introduce some complications in an otherwise standard asymptotic analysis .",
    "we will follow the approach of geyer ( 1994 ) .",
    "proofs of the results presented here can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "the first result of this section , consistency of the estimator , is essentially a consequence of model identifiability .",
    "it is not obvious that model ( [ eq : lambda_exp ] ) is identifiable , so this is proved first in the supplementary material .",
    "[ thm : constcy]if the smoothing parameter @xmath123 goes to zero as @xmath120 , either deterministically or in probability , then @xmath124    as explained in section [ sec : model ] , the parameter space @xmath125 is of the form @xmath126  with an @xmath97 that we will assume convex and open .",
    "for example , for the model with independent gamma scores , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "so @xmath97 is not a problem for the asymptotics because it does not contribute active constraints .",
    "the problem is the space @xmath122 , which is a convex but closed set . in particular , the non - negativity constraints create some unusual asymptotics ; for example , if a given @xmath129 is zero , it is clear that @xmath130 can not be asymptotically normal since it is a nonnegative quantity for all @xmath39 .    to handle these constraints",
    "we need to introduce the notion of tangent cone .",
    "let @xmath131 and @xmath132 be such that @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the tangent cone of @xmath125 at @xmath135 is the set of all directions and limits of directions from which @xmath136 can be approached with sequences that stay inside @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath136 is in the interior of @xmath125 it can be approached from any direction , so the tangent cone is the whole @xmath137 in that case .",
    "but if @xmath136 is on the border of @xmath125 it can only be approached from certain directions ; for example , if @xmath138 then the approaching sequences must necessarily satisfy @xmath139 to stay inside @xmath125 .",
    "an in - depth treatment of tanget cones can be found in hiriart - urruty and lemarchal ( 2001 , ch .",
    "the tangent cone of the product of convex sets is the product of the respective tangent cones , so the tangent cone of @xmath125 at @xmath136 is @xmath140 , with @xmath141and @xmath142 .",
    "the following theorem gives the asymptotic distribution of @xmath143 in a form as explicit as can be given for a general @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath144 be fisher s information matrix , @xmath145where the derivatives of @xmath146 are taken with respect to the parameter @xmath147 .",
    "[ thm : asymp]if @xmath148 as @xmath149 , either deterministically or in probability , then @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the maximizer of @xmath152over @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "although a closed expression for @xmath151 in theorem [ thm : asymp ] is not available in general , @xmath151 is easy to simulate : one generates @xmath155 monte carlo samples @xmath156 from a @xmath157 distribution and then computes @xmath158 for each @xmath159 , which involves a simple quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints .",
    "but in the particular case where all component coefficients @xmath129 are strictly positive , we can be more explicit : write a @xmath153 as @xmath160 with @xmath161 and @xmath162 ; since there are no inequality constraints in ( [ eq : t_cone ] ) , the only restriction for @xmath163 is that @xmath164 .",
    "the matrix @xmath165 is @xmath166 of rank @xmath116 , so there exists an orthogonal @xmath167 matrix @xmath168 such that @xmath169 and @xmath170 for some unconstrained @xmath171 .",
    "let @xmath172 then @xmath173with @xmath174 and @xmath175 , so @xmath176note that @xmath177 with @xmath178 , so @xmath179 has a non - singular @xmath180 distribution but @xmath151 itself has a singular @xmath181 distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the diagonal elements of @xmath182 can be used as variance estimators to construct , for example , confidence intervals for the elements of @xmath147 .",
    "we ran some simulations to study the finite - sample performance of the estimators .",
    "we considered two models like ( [ eq : lambda_exp ] ) , both with two components : model 1 had @xmath183 and @xmath184 as components , for @xmath185 $ ] , which are two peaks with practically no overlap ; model 2 had @xmath186 and @xmath187 , for @xmath188 $ ] , which are also unimodal but flatter functions with more overlap .",
    "the component scores @xmath189 and @xmath190 had lognormal distributions with @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 for both models .",
    "two sample sizes were considered , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .    for estimation we used cubic @xmath21-splines for the @xmath49s , with @xmath197 and @xmath198 equispaced knots , and gamma - distributed component scores .",
    "the estimating models are somewhat different from the data - generating models , which allows us to investigate the robustness of the estimators to model misspecification .",
    "the smoothing parameter @xmath115 was chosen by five - fold cross - validation ; for comparison we also computed estimators with the optimal @xmath199 that minimizes the mean squared error , which gives us a lower bound that can not be attained in practice but serves as a benchmark to judge the adequacy of five - fold cross - validation as a method for choosing @xmath115 .",

    "we only report the results for the ten - knot estimators , since they were uniformly better than the five - knot estimators .",
    "again , we report the errors of both the cross - validated and the optimal independent - component - based estimators . note that for wu et al.s principal - component - based estimators we are choosing the optimal @xmath116 , so the errors observed in practice will be somewhat higher than those reported in table [ tab : sim_2 ] . unlike the results in table [ tab : sim_1 ]",
    ", the results in table [ tab : sim_2 ] do change with the model . for model 1",
    "the results are mixed , depending on the sample size and on whether we are estimating the density function or the intensity function .",
    "but for model 2 the independent - component - based estimators , even the cross - validated ones , clearly outperform wu et al.s principal - component - based estimators .",
    "in this section we analyze the spatial distribution of street robberies in chicago during the year 2014 .",
    "the data was downloaded from the city of chicago data portal , a very extensive data repository that provides , among other things , detailed information about every reported criminal incident in the city .",
    "the information provided includes type , date , time , and coordinates ( latitude and longitude ) of the incident . here",
    "we will focus on crimes typified as of primary type theft  and location street .",
    "there were 16,278 reported incidents of this type between january 1 , 2014 and december 31 , 2014 .",
    "their locations cover most of the city , as shown in figure [ fig : maps](a ) .",
    "investigating the spatial and temporal distribution of crime is important because , as noted by ratcliffe ( 2010 ) , crime opportunities are not uniformly distributed in space and time , and the discovery and analysis of spatial patterns may help better understand the role of geography and opportunity in the incidence of crime .",
    "the geographical analysis of crime is not new and goes back at least to guerry and quetelet in the early 1800s ( friendly , 2007 ) , but technological and data limitations hampered earlier attempts at crime mapping . only in the last few decades",
    "have software and hardware developed to the point of allowing efficient crime mapping , and only in the last few years have extensive crime data repositories like the city of chicago data portal become available .",
    "awareness of the geographical and temporal distribution of crime is necessary , for example , for efficient allocation of crime - prevention resources .",
    "sometimes even the most basic spatial analysis reveals unexpected results .",
    "figure [ fig : maps](b ) shows a kernel - density estimator for the points in figure [ fig : maps](a ) .",
    "those familiar with the chicago area will immediately notice that the mode occurs at the neighborhoods of wicker park and pulaski , an entertainment area with high pedestrian traffic that is not typically associated with crime and violence in people s mind .",
    "but it is well known to criminologists that street robbery tends to concentrate not on deprived neighborhoods per se but on places that they denominate crime attractors , areas that bring together , often in large numbers , people who carry cash , some of whom are distracted and vulnerable(bernasco and block , 2011 ) .",
    "we fitted independent component models for these data , using the 365 days as replications .",
    "we considered @xmath116s ranging from 2 to 5 and component scores with gamma distribution .",
    "as basis family @xmath85 for the components we used normalized gaussian radial kernels with 49 uniformly distributed centers in the rectangle @xmath202\\times \\lbrack 41.65,42.03]$ ] , the smallest rectangle that includes the domain of interest @xmath21 , the city of chicago .",
    "the smoothing parameter @xmath115 was chosen by five - fold cross - validation for each @xmath116 .",
    "the cross - validated criteria for @xmath203 were @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively , so we chose the model with four components .",
    "for this model the @xmath208s were @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , and @xmath213 was @xmath214 , so the respective expected values of the @xmath62s were @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the overall expected number of robberies per day in the city is then @xmath219 .",
    "contour plots of the four components are shown in figure [ fig : components ] .",
    "we computed the asymptotic variance estimators derived in section sec : asymptotics for the component coefficients and it turned out that many @xmath220s were indeed not significantly different from zero , but the plots obtained after filtering out these components were virtually identical to those in figure [ fig : components ] , so they are not shown here .",
    "the components in figure [ fig : components ] are well - localized and easily interpretable .",
    "the first component has a mode on the border of near north and lincoln park neighborhoods , and extends northwards towards lakeview and uptown .",
    "these are the most affluent neighborhoods in chicago , normally not associated with crime in people s perceptions , but the large number of affluent people on the streets make them ideal attractors  for street theft .",
    "the second component has a mode on washington park and extends eastwards towards the university of chicago campus , neighborhoods in the south side of the city that are well - known to be problematic ; the proportion of households below poverty level in washington park is 39% , and the unemployment level is 23% .",
    "the third component is bimodal , with the main mode at west town , roughly where the mode of the overall mean was ( figure [ fig : components](b ) ) , and a second mode at woodlawn and south shore neighborhoods .",
    "these are also neighborhoods with generally high levels of crime and poverty , although not as high as washington park .",
    "the fourth component is also bimodal .",
    "the main mode concentrates on the west side neighborhoods of humboldt park and west garfield , and the second mode on the south side neighborhoods of west englewood and gage park .",
    "these are the worst neighboorhoods in the city in terms of overall crime and poverty ; for example , the proportion of households below poverty level is 33% in humboldt park and 32% in west engelwood , and the percentages of people with no high school diploma are 37% and 30% , respectively .",
    "these similarities in demographics suggest that the bimodality of the components is not an artifact of the estimators but a real feature of the data .",
    "model ( [ eq : lambda_exp ] ) also provides estimators for the individual intensity functions , @xmath221 .",
    "two examples are shown in figure [ fig : days_312_206 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : days_312_206](a ) corresponds to november 8 , the day with the largest first component score , and figure [ fig : days_312_206](c ) to july 25 , the day with the largest fourth component score .",
    "there was a total of 43 thefts in november 8 , 35 of which were associated with the first component , as determined by the @xmath222s ; specifically , for each incident @xmath223 we found @xmath224 , which indicates what component @xmath225 is most strongly associated with .",
    "the corresponding estimator of the intensity function is shown in figure fig : days_312_206(b ) , which accurately reflects the distribution of the points in figure [ fig : days_312_206](a ) . in july 25",
    "there was a total of 72 street robberies , 17 of which were associated with the first component , 17 with the second , 0 with the third and 38 with the fourth .",
    "the corresponding intensity function is shown in figure [ fig : days_312_206](d ) , and it is again an accurate representation of the distribution of the points in figure [ fig : days_312_206](c ) . if we were using individual kernel smoothers for the intensity functions , with only 43 or even 72 data points we would not be able to obtain estimators that are smooth and fine - detailed at the same time , like those in figure [ fig : days_312_206 ] ; a small bandwidth would produce irregular estimators and a large bandwidth would produce featureless estimators .",
    "an analysis of the component scores also reveals interesting patterns .",
    "it is known that some types of crime tend to follow seasonal patterns ; violent crimes in particular tend to increase during the summer ( field , 1992 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : scores ] shows that this is indeed the case for street theft in chicago .",
    "even though there is a large variability , the seasonal trends are plain to see , in particular for the second component which shows a very clear peak in july .",
    "the first and third components also reach their maxima in july , although their curves are flatter . the fourth component , on the other hand , has two local peaks in april and september . whether these peaks are systematic across the years",
    "may be established by analyzing data from previous years , since the city of chicago data portal has daily crime data going back to 2001 , but we will not do that here .    finally , we investigated the distribution of the time of the incidents .",
    "figure [ fig : times ] shows kernel density estimators of the time of robbery for each component . since the minimum always occurs at 5 am , for better visualization we shifted the points between 0 and 4 am to the other end by adding 24 , so e.g.  3 am became 27 .",
    "we see that the largest number of incidents tend to occur around 8 pm for all regions , but while the distribution is strongly unimodal for the north side neighborhoods ( figure [ fig : times](a ) ) , for the other regions there are clear plateaus earlier in the day ( figures [ fig : times](b  d ) ) .",
    "these plots , however , may hide seasonal variations like those seen in figure [ fig : scores ]",
    ". a more thorough analysis of these variations would need models that incorporate covariates , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
