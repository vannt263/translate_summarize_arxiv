    "the proposed amplitudes in t and b spaces , connected by fourier transforms , are written @xmath1 with the t - shape function @xmath2~,\\label{cd1_s}%\\ ] ] and @xmath3 with the b - shape function @xmath4~.\\ ] ] the parameters ( four for the imaginary and four for the real parts ) have very regular behavior . in figure [ figureone ]",
    "we show the parameters @xmath5 ( linear in @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( quadratic in @xmath6 of the imaginary part , that together determine the total cross section .",
    "the normalization is defined by @xmath8 these amplitudes account for the non - perturbative dynamics governing elastic scattering at high energies @xcite .",
    "the imaginary and real amplitudes in t - space show respectively one and two zeros .",
    "for very large t above 5 gev@xmath9 there are additional perturbative contributions to the real part , of very small magnitude ( three gluon exchange @xmath10 ) .",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath11 , etc , that correspond to interactions in rings of radius b in the transverse plane are written @xmath12 @xmath13   @xmath14 in the lhs of figure [ figuretwo ] we show the forms of the inelastic differential cross sections as function of b for the energies 546 gev and 7 tev .",
    "these functions are also shown separately for the cases of pure contributions from the gaussian part and from the shape function part of the amplitude .",
    "we observe that the gaussian part is more concentrated for small b , with limited increase with the energy , and that the shape function part is extended for larger b values , and that it determines the observed energy increase of the integrated cross section ( squared @xmath6 ) .",
    "the distinguished behaviour of the two parts of the amplitude ( gaussian and shape function parts ) is quantitatively shown in the rhs of figure [ figuretwo ] , where the average values of the interaction radius are represented .",
    "these quantities are @xmath15 with the normalization factor n. analogous expressions are defined for the total and elastic cross sections .",
