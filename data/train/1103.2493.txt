    "recently , there has been much interest in understanding the behavior of multiple access channels under constraints . considerable amount of work has been carried out on the problem of how users can obtain an acceptable throughput by choosing rates independently . motivated by the interest in studying a large population of users playing the game over time , evolutionary game theory was found to be an appropriate framework for communication networks .",
    "it has been applied to problems such as power control in wireless networks and mobile interference control @xcite . in @xcite , an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn )",
    "multiple access channel problem was modeled as a noncooperative game with pairwise interactions , in which users were modeled as rational entities whose only interest was to maximize their own communication rates .",
    "the authors obtained the nash equilibria of the two - user game and introduced a two - player evolutionary game model with _ pairwise interactions _ based on replicator dynamics .",
    "however , the case when interactions are not pairwise arises frequently in communication networks , such the code division multiple access ( cdma ) or the orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) in worldwide interoperability for microwave access ( wimax ) environment @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the study of @xcite to wireless communication systems with an arbitrary number of users corresponding to each receiver .",
    "we formulate a static non - cooperative game with @xmath0 users subject to rate capacity constraints and extend the constrained game to a dynamic evolutionary game with a large number of users whose strategies evolve over time .",
    "different from evolutionary games with discrete and finite number of actions , our model is based on a class of continuous games , known as _ continuous - trait games_. evolutionary games with continuum action spaces can be seen in a wide variety of applications in evolutionary ecology , such as evolution of phenology , germination , nutrient foraging in plants , and predator - prey foraging @xcite .      the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows .",
    "we show that the static continuous kernel rate allocation game with coupled rate constraints has a convex set of pure nash equilibria , coinciding with the maximal face of the polyhedral capacity region .",
    "all the pure equilibria are pareto optimal and are also strong equilibria , resilient to simultaneous deviation by coalition of any size .",
    "we show that the pure nash equilibria in the rate allocation problem are 100% efficient in terms of price of anarchy ( poa ) and constrained strong price of anarchy ( cspoa ) .",
    "we study the stability of strong equilibria , normalized equilibria , and evolutionary stable strategies ( ess ) using evolutionary game dynamics such as brown - von neumann - nash dynamics , generalized smith dynamics , and replicator dynamics .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we present in the next section the evolutionary game model of rate allocation in additive white gaussian multiple access wireless networks , and analyze its equilibria and pareto optimality . in section  [ secrobust ] ,",
    "we present strong equilibria and price of anarchy of the game . in section [ secselection ] ,",
    "we discuss how to select one specific equilibrium such as normalized equilibrium and evolutionary stable strategies .",
    "section  [ secdynamics ] studies the stability of equilibria and evolution of strategies using game dynamics .",
    "section  [ secconclud ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a communication system consisting of several receivers and several senders ( see figure [ figfuncttt3 ] ) . at each time , there are many local interactions ( typically , at each receiver there is a local interaction ) at the same time",
    ". each local interaction will correspond to a non - cooperative one - shot game with common constraints .",
    "the opponents do not necessarily stay the same from a given time slot to another time slot .",
    "users revise their rates in view of their payoffs and the coupled constraints ( for example by using an evolutionary process , a learning process or a trial - and - error updating process ) .",
    "the game evolves in time .",
    "users are interested in maximizing a fitness function based on their own communication rates at each time , and they are aware of the fact that the other users have the same goal .",
    "the coupled power and rate constraints are also common knowledge .",
    "users have to choose independently their own coding rates at the beginning of the communication , where the rates selected by a user may be either deterministic , or chosen from some distribution .",
    "if the rate profile arrived at as a result of these independent decisions lies in the capacity region , users will communicate at that operating point .",
    "otherwise , either the receiver is unable to decode any signal and the observed rates are zero , or only one of the signals can be decoded .",
    "the latter case occurs when all the other users are transmitting at or below a safe rate . with these assumptions",
    ", we can define a constrained non - cooperative game .",
    "the set of allowed strategies for user @xmath1 is the set of all probability distributions over @xmath2 and the payoff is a function of the rates .",
    "in addition , the rational action ( rates ) sets are restricted to lie in the capacity regions ( the payoff is zero if the constraint is violated ) . in order to study the interactions between the selfish or partially cooperative users and their stationary rates in the long run , we propose to model",
    "the rate allocation in gaussian multiple access channels as an evolutionary game with a continuous action space and coupled constraints .",
    "the development of evolutionary game theory is a major contribution of biology to competitive decision making and the evolution of cooperation .",
    "the key concepts of evolutionary game theory are ( i ) _ evolutionary stable strategies _ @xcite , which is a refinement of equilibria , and ( ii ) _ evolutionary game dynamics _ such as replicator dynamics @xcite , which describes the evolution of strategies or frequencies of use of strategies in time , @xcite .",
    "the single population evolutionary rate allocation game is described as follows : there is one population of senders ( users ) and several receivers .",
    "the number of senders is large . at each time , there are many one - shot games called _ local interactions_. each sender of the population chooses from the same set of strategies @xmath3 which is a non - empty , convex and compact subset of @xmath4 without loss of generality , we can suppose that user @xmath1 chooses its rate in the interval @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the rate upper bound for user @xmath1 ( to be made precise shortly ) , as outside of the capacity region the payoff ( as to be defined later ) will be zero .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of probability distributions over the pure strategy set @xmath8 the set @xmath9 can be interpreted as the set of mixed strategies .",
    "it is also interpreted as the set of distributions of strategies among the population .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be a @xmath12 measurable subset of @xmath13 ; then @xmath14 represents the fraction of users choosing a strategy out of @xmath15 , at time @xmath16 a distribution @xmath17 is sometimes called the  state \" of the population .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the borel @xmath19algebra on @xmath3 and by @xmath20 the distance between two states measured with the respect to the weak topology .",
    "each user s payoff depends on opponents behavior through the distribution of opponents choices and of their strategies .",
    "the payoff of a user @xmath1 in a local interaction with @xmath21 other users is given as a function @xmath22 the rate profile @xmath23 must belong to a common capacity region @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 linear inequalities . the expected payoff of a sender transmitting with the rate @xmath26 when the state of the population is @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 the expected payoff is @xmath29 the population state is subjected to the  mixed extension \" of capacity constraints @xmath30 this will be discussed in section [ secdynamics ] and will be made more precise later .",
    "a local interaction refers to the problem setting of one receiver and its uplink additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) multiple access channel with several senders ( say @xmath31 ) with coupled constraints ( or actions ) .",
    "the signal at the receiver is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a transmitted signal of user @xmath1 and @xmath34 is zero mean gaussian noise with variance @xmath35 each user has an individual power constraint @xmath36 the optimal power allocation scheme is to transmit at the maximum power available , i.e. @xmath37 , for each user .",
    "hence , we consider the case in which maximum power is attained .",
    "the decisions of the users then consist of choosing their communication rates , and the receiver s role is to decode , if possible .",
    "the capacity region is a set of all vectors @xmath38 such that users @xmath39 can reliably communicate at rate @xmath40 the capacity region @xmath41 for this channel is the set @xmath42 where @xmath43 we refer the reader to @xcite for more details on the capacity region .",
    "notice that there is a tradeoff between high and low rates : if user @xmath1 wants to communicate at a higher rate , one of the other users @xmath44 may need to lower its rate , otherwise the capacity constraint is violated .",
    "( example of capacity region with three users ) in this example , we illustrate the capacity region with three users .",
    "let @xmath45 be the rates of the users .",
    "based on ( [ tet ] ) , we obtain    @xmath46 where in the compact notation , @xmath47 @xmath48 note that @xmath49 is a totally unimodular matrix . by letting @xmath50",
    "we show in figure  [ figfunctt3 ] the capacity region with three users .",

    "this strategy @xmath79 is pareto optimal because the rate of each user is maximized under the capacity constraint .",
    "these strategies are social welfare if the quantity @xmath80 is maximized .",

    "an action profile in a local interaction between @xmath0 senders is a constrained @xmath81strong equilibrium if it is feasible and no coalition of size @xmath44 can improve the rate transmissions of each of its members with respect to the capacity constraints .",
    "an action is a constrained strong equilibrium @xcite if it is a constrained @xmath81strong equilibrium for any size @xmath82 a strong equilibrium is then a policy from which no coalition ( of any size ) can deviate and improve the transmission rate of every member of the coalition ( group of the simultaneous moves ) , while possibly lowering the transmission rate of users outside the coalition group .",
    "this notion of constrained strong equilibria is very attractive because it is resilient against coalitions of users .",
    "most of the games do not admit any strong equilibrium but in our case we will show that the multiple access channel game has several strong equilibria .    any rate profile on the maximal face of the capacity region @xmath83 @xmath84 is a constrained strong equilibrium .",
    "we remark that if the rate profile @xmath85 is not on the maximal face of the capacity region , then @xmath85 is not resilient to deviation by a single user .",
    "hence , @xmath85 can not be a constrained strong equilibrium .",
    "this says that a necessary condition for a rate profile to be a strong equilibrium is to be in the subset @xmath86 we now prove that the condition : @xmath87 is sufficient .",
    "let @xmath88 suppose that @xmath44 users deviate simultaneously from the rate profile @xmath89 denote by @xmath90 the set of users which deviate simultaneously ( eventually by forming a coalition ) .",

    "if the rates of some of the deviants are increased , then the rates of some other users from coalition must decrease .",

    "nash equilibria and strong equilibria in pure strategies coincide .",

    ", we assume that the function @xmath67 is the identity function , i.e. , @xmath116 one of the approaches used to measure how much the performance of decentralized systems is affected by the selfish behavior of its components is the _ price of anarchy_. we present a similar price for strong equilibria under the coupled rate constraints .",
    "this notion of price of anarchy can be seen as an _ efficiency metric _ that measures the _ price of selfishness _ or decentralization and has been extensively used in the context of congestion games or routing games where typically users have to minimize a cost function . in the context of rate allocation in the multiple access channel , we define an equivalent measure of price of anarchy for rate maximization problems .",
    "one of the advantages of a strong equilibrium is that it has the potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior , typically in the case where the capacity constraint is violated at each time .",
    "since the constrained rate allocation game has strong equilibria , we can define the strong price of anarchy , introduced in @xcite , as the ratio between the payoff of the worst constrained strong equilibrium and the social optimum value which @xmath117 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we formulate an evolutionary multiple access channel game with continuous - variable actions and coupled rate constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize nash equilibria of the game and show that the pure nash equilibria are pareto optimal and also resilient to deviations by coalitions of any size , i.e. , they are strong equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> we use the concepts of price of anarchy and strong price of anarchy to study the performance of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also addresses how to select one specific equilibrium solution using the concepts of normalized equilibrium and evolutionary stable strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the long - run behavior of these strategies under several classes of evolutionary game dynamics such as brown - von neumann - nash dynamics , and replicator dynamics . </S>"
