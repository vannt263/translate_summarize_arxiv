    "saturation is now a very popular term , but it has a very wide meaning .",
    "it includes shadowing and antishadowing processes , the saturation of the froissart - martin bound @xcite , gluon merging at small @xmath0 and geometrical scaling , unitarization effects , etc . in the @xmath1-matrix language",
    ", saturation means that we reach the maximum possible scattering .",
    "this happens for a specific value of the impact parameter , and is directly connected with the unitary property of the scattering amplitude .",
    "it is that last meaning that we shall use in our work .",
    "the most important results on the energy dependence of diffractive hadronic scattering were obtained from first principles ( analyticity , unitarity and lorentz invariance ) , which lead to specific analytic forms for the scattering amplitude as a function of its kinematical parameters @xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "analytic @xmath1-matrix theory relates the high - energy behaviour of hadronic scattering to the singularities of the scattering amplitude in the complex angular momentum plane .",
    "one of the important theorems is the froissart - martin bound , which states that the high - energy cross section for the scattering of hadrons is limited by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a scale factor and @xmath8 the lightest hadron mass ( _ i.e. _ the pion mass ) .",
    "as the coefficient in front of the logarithm is very large , `` saturation of the froissart - martin bound '' usually refers to an energy dependence of the total cross section rising as @xmath9 rather than to the actual limit for the total cross section .",
    "experimental data reveal that total cross sections grow with energy .",
    "this means that the leading contribution in the high - energy limit is given by the rightmost singularity in the complex-@xmath10 plane , the pomeron , with intercept exceeding unity . in the framework of perturbative qcd",
    ", the intercept is expected to exceed unity by an amount proportional to @xmath11 @xcite . at leading - log @xmath3 ,",
    "one obtains a rightmost singularity at @xmath12 .",
    "such a singularity @xmath2 the hard pomeron @xmath2 seems to be present in inelastic diffractive processes @xcite and may be present in soft scattering , where it appears as a simple pole with intercept @xmath13 for energies smaller than 100 gev @xcite . in this case , the froissart - martin bound is soon violated , and the bdl - regime may appear at relatively low energies .",
    "the effect of saturation on the growth of the total cross section is however far from clear , because it involves processes at very small @xmath0 and non - perturbative effects .",
    "saturation in the framework of perturbative qcd may be connected with the growth of the gluon density at small @xmath0 , which must be bounded by non - linear effects . in principle",
    ", the gluon density may have a maximum which will be reached before the bdl ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the non - linear corrections added to the bfkl equation lead to a saturation regime at relatively large impact parameters , and are not directly related with the bdl , which first occurs at small impact parameters .",
    "one must note that , even in perturbative qcd , the description of saturation at large impact parameters is problematic because of non - perturbative effects , connected with confinement @xcite .",
    "unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath14 is most suitably studied in the impact parameter representation @xcite as it is equivalent ( at high energy ) to a decomposition in partial - wave amplitudes .",
    "we thus take the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ^ 2 + [ re g(s , b)]^2 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as energy grows , the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation can exceed the unitarity bound for a range of impact parameters @xmath18 . to restore unitarity",
    ", there are several different schemes .",
    "two of them are based on the solution of the unitarity equation @xcite .",
    "the first and most popular scheme seems to be the eikonal representation .",
    "@xmath19 where the eikonal function @xmath20 , which in the non - relativistic regime is equal to the scattering potential , is often taken as the born scattering amplitude .    the second unitarization scheme which we shall consider is the @xmath21-matrix scheme @xcite , which we rescale so that the unitarized amplitude becomes asymptotically @xmath22 as @xmath23 : @xmath24 with @xmath25",
    ". if we assume that the born scattering amplitude factorises as @xmath26 , we can rewrite this scheme as the solution of the non - linear equation @xmath27 ) .",
    "\\label{nl - n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that eikonal representation also corresponds the non - linear equation like above @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 we can also obtain the above schemes by assuming that @xmath29 , in which case @xmath30    we can also easily obtain new unitarization schemes @xcite , such as @xmath31   ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the non - linear equation in the form @xmath32    at first sight , these three schemes are quite different . however we can represent them in one form @xmath33    in order for eq .",
    "( [ common ] ) to produce a unitary amplitude , it is sufficient to impose the following properties on @xmath34 : + a ) it must be an analytic function of its variable @xmath3 and @xmath35 , and satisfy crossing symmetry , + b ) it must not exceed unity , + c ) when @xmath36 , @xmath37 , + d ) when @xmath38 , @xmath39 , + e ) at large @xmath35 , it must fall faster than a power .",
    "the functions @xmath40 of the above unitarization schemes satisfy such conditions . for the eikonal it has the standard form @xmath41,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the rescaled @xmath21-matrix @xmath42 and for hyperbolic tangent representation",
    "@xmath43 the differences between these functions is connected with different form of the saturation regime .    in the following",
    ", we shall assume that the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation can be factorised @xmath44 , and that the energy dependence of @xmath45 is a power @xmath46    we find that the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the amplitude and hence of the total cross section depends on the form of @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependence of the slope of the elastic scattering amplitude .    in fig",
    ". 1 the process of saturation of the unitarity bound in the case of the three unitarization schemes is presented .",
    "it is clear that despite the slight difference in the growth the overlapping function with energy , the profile at the lhc will be similar for all these three unitarization schemes ( see fig .",
    "-0.5 cm    the overlapping function is complex , because it must be crossing symmetric . in that case",
    ", @xmath3 can be replaced by @xmath48 . at very low energies , before the first inelastic channel opens , the total cross section is equal to the elastic cross section and the overlapping function has a large real part .",
    "when the energy grows and the overlapping function reaches the black disk limit ( bdl ) ( see , for example @xcite ) , the elastic cross section will be one half of the total cross section .",
    "then the real part of the overlapping function disappears at small impact parameters .",
    "this has a small impact on the behavior of the total cross section , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , where we compare the values of @xmath49 in the case of a purely imaginary eikonal and of a complex eikonal .",
    "we have shown that the impact parameter is the natural variable to study unitarity of the scattering amplitude . in particular",
    ", the unitarity bound leads to the black disk limit at high energies .",
    "the corresponding saturation phenomena may be connected with the saturation of the partonic density of the interacting hadrons . as a step in that direction",
    ", we showed that the usual unitarization schemes are in one - to - one correspondence with nonlinear equations .",
    "such an approach can be used to build new unitarization schemes and may also shed some light on the physical processes underlying the saturation regime . in the presence of a hard pomeron",
    "the saturation effects can change the behavior of some features of the cross sections already at lhc energies . in the unitarisation schemes considered here ,",
    "non - linear effects appear before the bdl and lead to an acceptable growth of the total cross sections .",
    "saturation then leads to a relative growth of the contribution of peripheral interactions , and to changes in energy dependence of the differential cross sections for moderate values of the momentum transfer .",
    "such effects in the differential elastic cross section can be discovered at the lhc .",
