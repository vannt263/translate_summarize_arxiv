    "in hierarchical structure formation models , the most massive early - type galaxies are assembled last ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this simple picture seems difficult to reconcile with recent studies showing that the first massive , quiescent galaxies were already in place when the universe was only @xmath73 gyr old ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the recent discovery that these high - redshift galaxies still grow significantly in size ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and mass @xcite solves this apparent conflict .",
    "the observed compact high - redshift galaxies may simply be the cores of local massive early - type galaxies , which grow inside - out by accreting ( smaller ) galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thus assemble a significant part of their mass at later times ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "secondly , the stellar mass estimates suffer from uncertainties in stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models , the paucity of spectroscopic redshifts , and furthermore rely on assumptions regarding the initial mass function ( imf ) and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "hence we conclude that the scatter is mostly _ intrinsic _ , and not observational .",
    "a direct measure of the average offset of the sizes and dispersions can be obtained by increasing the number of observed galaxies to about 30 , which would reduce the error by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "alternatively , the average mass - size relation can be used to determine the average offset at @xmath72 .",
