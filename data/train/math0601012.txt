    "the classical ( degree two ) frobenius - schur indicator introduced a century ago as well as the higher indicators are well - known invariants of an irreducible representation of a finite group .",
    "the degree two indicators for simple modules over a semisimple hopf algebra were studied by linchenko and montgomery @xcite , a version for certain fusion categories by fuchs , ganchev , szlachanyi , and vescernyes @xcite , and a more general version for simple objects in pivotal categories by fuchs and schweigert @xcite .",
    "bantay introduced a notion of frobenius - schur indicator for a primary field of a conformal field theory via a formula in terms of the modular data .",
    "the higher indicators for hopf algebras were introduced and studied in depth by kashina , sommerhuser , and zhu @xcite .",
    "the degree two indicators for simple modules of a semisimple quasi - hopf algebra were studied by mason and ng @xcite , and given a different treatment by schauenburg @xcite .",
    "the higher indicators introduced in @xcite are a generalization of all of the above to the case of pivotal fusion categories , with more details and examples for the special case of modules over a semisimple quasi - hopf algebra worked out in @xcite .",
    "the definition of the indicator @xmath3 of a simple object @xmath4 in a pivotal fusion category @xmath5 in @xcite says that @xmath3 is the trace of a certain endomorphism @xmath6 of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 for a semisimple hopf algebra over @xmath9 , we can identify @xmath7 with the invariant subspace of @xmath10 , and @xmath6 corresponds to a cyclic permutation of tensor factors .",
    "thus , our definition corresponds to the `` first formula '' for the indicator given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.3 ) .",
    "the _ definition _ of the higher indicators in @xcite is in terms of hopf powers of the integral , namely @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the normalized integral and @xmath13 the character of @xmath4 .",
    "this formula is generalized by the description in @xcite of the @xmath14-th indicator as the pivotal trace of the @xmath14-th frobenius - schur endomorphism of @xmath4 ; that this is indeed a direct generalization of the defining formula in @xcite becomes evident from the calculations done in @xcite for the quasi - hopf algebra case .    in the present paper ,",
    "we prove a generalization of the `` third formula '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , corollary ) for the higher indicators , which says that the @xmath14-th indicator of @xmath4 is the trace of the drinfeld element of the double @xmath15 taken on the induced module @xmath16 .",
    "the appropriate generalization to the categorical setting is the following : for a spherical fusion category @xmath5 , consider the two - sided adjoint @xmath17 of the forgetful functor , where @xmath18 is the ( left ) center of @xmath5 .",
    "then the @xmath14-th indicator @xmath3 is @xmath19 times the pivotal trace on @xmath20 of the @xmath14-th power of the twist in the ribbon category @xmath18 .",
    "we prove this in section [ sec : fs - ribbon ] , making use of results of mger on the adjoint @xmath21 and ocneanu s tube algebra for @xmath5 .",
    "the key ingredient is another formula for the @xmath14-th indicator in terms of the @xmath14-th power of a special central element @xmath22 in the tube algebra of @xmath5 obtained in section [ sec : tube ] .    in the hopf algebra case ,",
    "the `` second formula '' ( * ? ? ? * , proposition ) , of which the `` third formula '' is a reformulation using the terminology of the drinfeld double , connects the theory of indicators to the exponent of a hopf algebra studied by kashina @xcite and etingof and gelaki @xcite . in more detail , kashina , sommerhuser and zhu define the exponent of an irreducible representation of a semisimple complex hopf algebra @xmath0 , and they characterize it as the order of a certain endomorphism of the induced representation , the traces of whose powers are the higher indicators . as a consequence of their results ,",
    "the exponent of @xmath0 is the least common multiple of the exponents of the irreducible representations ; the exponent of an irreducible representation in turn is the period of the sequence formed by its higher indicators , or the least number @xmath14 such that the @xmath14-th indicator is the representation s dimension .",
    "theorem [ t : nu_tr_formula ] implies that the sequence @xmath23 of the higher indicators of an object @xmath4 in the spherical fusion category @xmath5 is periodic as well .",
    "moreover , the @xmath24-th term of the sequence is the pivotal dimension @xmath25 of @xmath4 whenever @xmath24 is a multiple of the order of the twist of @xmath18 .    in section [ sec : fsexp ]",
    "we define the frobenius - schur exponent of an object @xmath4 in a pivotal category @xmath5 to be the least positive integer @xmath14 such that @xmath3 is the pivotal dimension @xmath25 of @xmath4 , and we define the frobenius - schur exponent of @xmath5 to be the least positive integer @xmath14 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "we then prove that if @xmath5 is a spherical fusion category , then its frobenius - schur exponent is equal to the order of the twist of @xmath18 . by @xcite",
    "the exponent is finite and our result implies that the exponent of @xmath5 divides the frobenius - schur exponent . as it turns out in the first examples of the same section , the frobenius - schur exponent is different in general from the exponent as defined by etingof @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : versus ] , however , we show that the frobenius - schur exponent can at most be twice the exponent .    bantay introduced the ( degree 2 ) frobenius - schur indicator for a primary field @xmath4 of a conformal field theory via a formula in terms of the modular data of the cft and he showed that the indicator of @xmath4 is 0 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 if @xmath30 ( cf .",

    "our formula for @xmath3 contains bantay s formula for degree two indicators as the special case @xmath31 .",
    "an important consequence of this formula is the invariance of frobenius - schur exponent of a spherical fusion category under the center construction .",
    "moreover , the frobenius - schur exponent of a modular tensor category is equal to the order of the twist .    in section [ sec : cauchy ]",
    "we obtain several results for complex semisimple quasi - hopf algebras @xmath0 , which have been known for hopf algebras , making use of frobenius - schur indicators and exponents .",
    "we prove that the dimension of @xmath0 is even if @xmath0 admits a self - dual simple module , and we generalize the hopf algebra version of cauchy s theorem from @xcite to our setting : the exponent , in the sense of etingof @xcite , and the dimension of a quasi - hopf algebra @xmath0 have the same prime factors .",
    "this result answer two questions of etingof and gelaki @xcite affirmatively for semisimple complex quasi - hopf algebras .",
    "we have also shown that the exponent and the frobenius - schur exponent coincide if the dimension of @xmath0 is odd .    in section [ sec : bounds ] we prove two bounds for the frobenius - schur exponent . in @xcite",
    "kashina asked whether the exponent of a semisimple complex hopf algebra always divides the dimension .",
    "etingof and gelaki ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 ) have shown that the exponent divides the third power of the dimension .",
    "as an immediate consequence of the results in @xcite the frobenius - schur exponent of a semisimple complex quasi - hopf algebra @xmath0 divides the fifth power of the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "we improve this bound by lowering the exponent to the fourth power .",
    "we also study an important class of quasi - hopf algebras , namely the group - theoretical quasi - hopf algebras corresponding to the group - theoretical fusion categories introduced by ostrik @xcite . for a group - theoretical quasi - hopf algebra @xmath0",
    "we can show that the ( frobenius - schur ) exponent divides the square of the dimension .",
    "more precisely , we can express the frobenius - schur exponent of a group - theoretical quasi - hopf algebra , which is constructed from a finite group @xmath32 and a three - cocycle @xmath33 on @xmath32 , in terms of the cohomology class of @xmath33 and its restrictions to the cyclic subgroups of @xmath32 .",
    "this same description of the exponent and the resulting general bound on the exponent for group - theoretical categories were recently obtained by natale @xcite .",
