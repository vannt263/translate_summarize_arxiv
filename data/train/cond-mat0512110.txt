    "recent advances in semiconductor physics and technology enabled the fabrication and investigation of nanostructure devices which have some important properties , such as small size , reduced dimensionality , relatively small density of charge carriers and , hence , large mean free path ( which means that particles exist in the ballistic regime , so that scattering processes can be neglected ) and large fermi wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "one of mesoscopic systems of particular interest is quantum wire in which particles are constrained to move along a one - dimensional curve due to quantization of the transverse modes @xcite . and one of the numerous important problems about that is the influence of the process of reducing the dimensionality upon properties of the system .",
    "jensen and koppe @xcite and da costa @xcite has emphasized that a low dimensional system , in general , has some knowledge of its surrounding three - dimensional cartesian space : the effective potential arises from the mesoscopic confinement process which constrains particles to move in domain of reduced dimensionality .",
    "namely , it was shown that a particle moving in a one- or two - dimensional domain is affected by attractive effective potential @xcite ; for the first time this result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and later in ref .",
    "this idea was widely studied by several other authors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite@xmath1@xcite and , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite about experimental realization of such systems ) .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the torsion of the twisted waveguide affects the wave propagation in the waveguide independently of the nature of the wave .",
    "in particular , the torsion of the waveguide results in the rotation of polarization of light in a twisted optical fiber @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors prove that in a waveguide , be it quantum or electromagnetic one , exist bound states .",
    "and there are also some references concerning the relation of the quantum waveguide theory to the classical theory of acoustic and electromagnetic waveguides in ref .",
    "exner2 .",
    "the effect of the curvature on quantum properties of electrons on a two - dimensional surface , in a quantum waveguide , or in a quantum wire can be observed by investigating kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of quantum systems @xcite@xmath1@xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose to use for this purpose measurements of the conductance @xmath2 of a quantum wire and we show that the reflection of electrons from regions with variable curvature results in non - monotonous dependence of the conductance on the applied bias .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the schrdinger equation on the elliptically shaped ring was solved numerically in order to get the eigenvalue spectrum of a particle confined to the ring .",
    "the authors demonstrated that the behavior of a quantum mechanical system confined by the rectangular well potential to a narrow ring in the limit when its width @xmath3  tends to zero is analogous to the straight line motion with effective potential @xmath4where @xmath5 is the radius of curvature .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite the electron energy spectrum in an elliptical quantum ring was considered in connection with the persistent current ; the authors have concluded that the effective potentials @xmath6 are different for different confining potentials even in the limit when @xmath3  tends to zero .",
    "this conclusion is in contradiction with results of some other papers @xcite , exner2 .",
    "so , in this paper we elaborate the problem ; we investigate the way of derivation of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation in order to understand deeper how constraining potential affects particle motion along the curve @xmath7 ; we demonstrate the consistency with previous results dacosta : the effective potential is universal for different confining potentials and depends only on the curvature ( see eq.([veff ] ) ) .",
    "in sec.2 we study derivation of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation starting from the two - dimensional schrdinger equation which describes a non - relativistic electron moving in a plane @xcite and being the subject to the confining potential @xmath8 .",
    "further , in sec.3 , we apply this results to consider theoretically the conductance of the quantum wire which consists of two linear parts and one elliptically shaped part between them ; the wire is connected to two conducting reservoirs at different voltages ( see fig.[scheme ] ) . and in sec.4 we discuss the influence of the curvature on the conductance .",
    "in this section we will follow the approach proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "let us consider an electron with effective mass @xmath9 moving in a quantum wire along a curve @xmath7 which is constructed by a prior confinement potential @xmath10 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we start from two - dimensional motion .",
    "we introduce the orthonormal coordinate system @xcite @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the arc length parameter and @xmath13 is the coordinate along the normal @xmath14 to the reference curve @xmath7",
    ". then the curve @xmath7 is described by a vector valued function @xmath15 of the arc length @xmath12 .",
    "so , the position in proximity to the curve @xmath7 is described by    @xmath16    to obtain a meaningful result the particle wave function should be  uniformly compressed  into a curve , avoiding in this way the tangential forces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , we consider @xmath10 to be dependent only on the @xmath13 coordinate which describes the displacement from the reference curve @xmath7 , this means that points with the same @xmath13 coordinate but different @xmath12 coordinates ( which describe the position on curve @xmath7 ) have the same potential .",
    "this potential contains small parameter @xmath3  so that the potential increases sharply for every small displacement in the normal direction ; @xmath3 is a characteristic width of the potential well @xmath8 ( the simplest examples of such a potential are the rectangular well potential and the parabolic - trough potential , albeit the real potential would likely be the combination of both ) .",
    "so , the small parameter of the problem is @xmath17 exner .",
    "the motion of the electron obeys the time - independent schrdinger equation which has the form    @xmath18    where the laplacian is    @xmath19    with @xmath20 being the lam coefficient ( corresponding to the longitudinal coordinate @xmath12 ) which depends thanks to frenet equation upon the curvature @xmath21 :    @xmath22    in order to eliminate the first - order derivative with respect to @xmath13 from eq.([init_schr_eq ] ) we naturally introduce @xcite new wave function @xmath23    @xmath24    which is , as a matter of fact , the wave function introduced in ref .",
    "dacosta which is normalized so that @xmath25and then the schrdinger equation eq.([init_schr_eq ] ) yields    @xmath26    where    @xmath27    which is in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "one should be careful with eq.([eq in s and q ] ) in order to avoid mistakes found in literature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "first , we can not decompose this equation , which contains terms which are functions of both @xmath12 and @xmath28 into two equations introducing @xmath29 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where authors have obtained the eq.(31 ) for @xmath30 with coefficients depending on the @xmath31 variable . to understand another mistake @xcite ,",
    "consider eq.([eq in s and q ] ) within the perturbation theory on small parameter @xmath32 [ comparatively with @xmath5 ] ( see also in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . expand @xmath34and  @xmath6 in series in @xmath35 writing down explicitly the zeroth term :    @xmath36 @xmath37 then eq.([eq in s and q ] ) can be rewritten :    @xmath38    where",
    "@xmath39    @xmath40    we notice that @xmath41 is a second order in the variable @xmath12 differential operator .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq with pert ] ) is    @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 corresponds to the zeroth - order approximation problem : @xmath45 .",
    "this equation can be decomposed by separating the wave function : @xmath46 : @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is given by eq.([veff ] ) ; @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is the curvature radius ( in the next section we omit the subscript ",
    "@xmath52  , identifying energy @xmath53 with its longitudinal component @xmath54 ) .",
    "eq.([transveq ] ) describes the confinement of the electron to a @xmath32-neighborhood of the curve @xmath7 and eq.([longiteq ] ) describes the motion along the @xmath12 coordinate ( along the curve @xmath7 ) .",
    "in fact , eq.(longiteq ) is a conventional one - dimensional schrdinger equation for an electron moving in the @xmath12-dependent potential @xmath49 ; the latter connects the geometry and the dynamical equation .",
    "the origin of this potential is in the wavelike properties of the particles ; @xmath6 is essential for not large @xmath55 we underline that the effective potential ( eq.([veff ] ) ) in the zeroth - order approximation in @xmath56 is not dependent on the method of   one - dimensionalization  ,",
    "i.e. on the choice of @xmath57 ( compare this conclusion with the one derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also note that if we have started from the three - dimensional equation of motion we would obtain an additional effective potential which in the planar situation is zero @xcite .",
    "the conductance @xmath2 of quantum contacts can be related to the transmission probability @xmath58  by landauer s formula @xcite . at zero temperature and finite voltages",
    "@xmath59 it takes the form    @xmath60   \\label{g}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 @xmath62 is the fermi energy .",
    "two terms in this equation correspond to two electronic beams moving in opposite directions and differing in bias energy .",
    "so , we are interested in the transmission probability @xmath58 with @xmath53 being an electron energy .    in this section",
    "we consider the curve @xmath7 to consist of three ideally connected parts ( see fig.[scheme ] ) : ( i ) linear ( @xmath63 ) , ( ii ) elliptical ( @xmath64 , @xmath52 is half of the ellipse s perimeter ) , and ( iii ) one more linear domain ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we consider wave functions in the regions ( i ) and ( iii ) to be plane waves @xmath66 @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the wave vector and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the transmission and reflection coefficients ; the transmission probability is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the wave function @xmath72 , where @xmath73  is the solution of eq.(longiteq ) , with the effective potential given by eq.([veff ] ) .",
    "the curvature can be written most simply in the elliptical @xmath74 coordinate whittaker which is defined with its lam coefficient    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the eccentricity of an ellipse and @xmath77 is the length of its major semiaxis ; we apply @xmath78 .",
    "then the effective ( geometrical ) potential ( see eq.([veff ] ) ) can be written as    @xmath79    which is in agreement with ref.@xcite .",
    "we introduce new wave function    @xmath80    for which the equation takes the form ( see eqs .",
    "( [ longiteq ] ) , ( [ h])-([ksi ] ) ) :    @xmath81 \\xi = 0 ,   \\label{hill's_eq}\\ ] ]    @xmath82    where @xmath83 eq.([hills_eq ] ) is the hill s equation with @xmath84-periodic coefficients ; fundamental system of its solutions is @xcite    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is a @xmath84-periodic function , @xmath87 is the characteristic exponent . then ( see eqs.([ksi ] ) and ( [ sol of hill s eq ] ) ) :    @xmath88    ( here @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , we know what wave functions are like and now we are interested in @xmath90 which describes transmission over potential well ( see eq.([v ] ) ) .",
    "then we make use of the conditions of continuity of the wave function and of its derivative , so we obtain the system of four equations which is similar to one given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; and so is the result : @xmath91 ^{-1 }   \\label{t}\\ ] ] where we denoted @xmath92 ( to get eq.([t ] ) we applied that @xmath87 and @xmath93 are real , which is straightforward to proof . )",
    "to understand how the conductivity @xmath2 depends on the bias @xmath94 and the geometry we need to find the solution of hill s equation eq.([hills_eq ] ) .",
    "we did this numerically as well as within the perturbation theory for an ellipse which is close to a circle ( i.e. @xmath95 ) ; we found that both are in good agreement for @xmath96 . in the zeroth - order approximation in @xmath97 ( i.e. for @xmath98 , the case of a circular arc ) we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 ( see also in ref .",
    "this means that one can observe oscillations in @xmath102 dependence provided @xmath103 and the amplitude of these oscillations is enough small .",
    "then we solve hill s equation eq.([hills_eq ] ) numerically .",
    "the characteristic exponent @xmath87 is defined via the solution of eq.(hills_eq ) with the initial conditions : @xmath108 @xmath109 , and then @xmath87 is the solution of the equation@xmath110 ( see in ref .",
    "more challenging is to find @xmath111 ( see eq.([sol of hill s eq ] ) ) , which can be formulated as the boundary value problem with eq.([hills_eq ] ) and boundary conditions @xmath112 @xmath113 ( where @xmath114 .",
    "we introduce @xmath115 , and so we have initial conditions problem for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 @xmath118 ) , the solution of which gives what we seek for to define @xmath93 : @xmath119 .",
    "the results of the described procedure are numerically plotted at figs.[g(ev ) ] and g(a ) which is for enough elongated ellipse with @xmath120 ( so that @xmath121 where @xmath77 and @xmath122 are the lengths of its major and minor semiaxes respectively ) .",
    "we note about fig .",
    "[ g(a ) ] that , being restricted by the condition @xmath123 , we should not tend @xmath77 to @xmath124 , namely , we may suppose @xmath123  for @xmath125 but may not for @xmath126 [ for @xmath76 close to @xmath127 .",
    "we also note that eq.(g ) is , strictly speaking , correct for @xmath94 small compared with @xmath62 and describes @xmath102  dependence for @xmath128 qualitatively .",
    "we conclude that @xmath76 close to @xmath129 increases significantly oscillations in comparison with @xmath98 case ; the amplitude of oscillations in @xmath130 dependence is defined by the value of @xmath131 .        in summary",
    ", we have rederived the quantum - mechanical effective potential induced by curvature of one - dimensional quantum wire .",
    "we have shown that for any confining potential @xmath8 , depending only on the displacement @xmath13 from the reference curve @xmath7 , this effective potential is universal : it does not depend on the choice of @xmath8 and is given by eq.([veff ] ) .",
    "and then we have studied the effect of the curvature in the zeroth - order approximation in the width of the wire on the conductance of an ideal elliptically shaped quantum wire .",
    "it has been shown , in particular , that , due to the effect of the curvature , dependence of the conductance @xmath102 on the applied bias changes drastically .",
    "so , the effect of the curvature can be observed by measuring the conductance of a quantum wire . on the other hand , one can change the characteristics of the quantum wire , such as conductance , setting its size , shape , or applied bias .",

    "vagner for his warm hospitality during the stay at grenoble high magnetic field laboratory ( france ) where the part of this work was done .",
    "we also thank prof .",
    "a.m. kosevich for critical discussion of the manuscript .",
    "the advantages of establishing from the very beginning the @xmath136 coordinate system are that it allows the most general consideration and that [ because of the diagonal structure of the metric tensor ] we can in the zeroth - order approximation in the width of the quantum wire decompose the dynamical equation of motion into two .",
