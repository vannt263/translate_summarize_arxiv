    "the theorem as we shall prove it is about simply connected open subsets of the plane @xmath0 .",
    "people usually interpret `` simply connected '' in this context to mean topologically simply connected , i.e. , that the open set is connected and also that every continuous closed curve in the open set can be continuously deformed inside the open set to a constant curve .",
    "as it happens , we shall end up proving a slightly different result which , on the face of it , is stronger .",
    "namely , we shall assume about the open set only that it is connected and has the property that every holomorphic function on it has a ( holomorphic ) anti - derivative .",
    "that is , if @xmath1 is a holomorphic function on the open set then there is a holomorphic function @xmath2 on the set with @xmath3 .",
    "we shall say then that @xmath4 is _ holomorphically simply connected_.    it is easy to show that topological simple connectivity as defined implies the holomorphic anti - derivative property just described . the theorem itself in the following form will show among other things the converse , namely , that the holomorphic simple connectivity implies topological simple connectivity .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 is a connected open subset of @xmath0 with @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath4 is holomorphically simply connected , then @xmath4 is biholomorphic to the unit disc , i.e. , there is a one - to - one holomorphic function from @xmath4 onto the unit disc @xmath6 .    in the proof of this result",
    ", it will be useful to be able to assume that @xmath4 is bounded .",
    "for this , we recall the familiar fact that such a @xmath4 as in the theorem is always biholomorphic to a bounded open set .",
    "the proof of this in summary form goes like this . since @xmath5",
    ", we can replace @xmath4 by a translate to suppose that @xmath7 .",
    "the function @xmath8 is then holomorphic on @xmath4 and hence has an antiderivative @xmath9 , say .",
    "changing @xmath10 by an additive constant will arrange that @xmath11 ( this is the usual process for finding complex logarithms ) .",
    "then @xmath12 is one - to - one on @xmath4 .",
    "choose an open disc in the image of @xmath12 .",
    "the negative of this disc is disjoint from the image of @xmath12 .",
    "so the image of @xmath12 , which is biholomorphic to @xmath4 , is itself biholomorphic to a bounded open subset of @xmath0 , via a linear fractional transformation .",
    "note that it is not clear by definition that the holomorphic simple connectivity is preserved by a biholomorphic mapping since the meaning of taking the derivative is different when the coordinates change ; but by the complex chain rule this is a matter of a holomorphic factor which can be assimilated into the original function .",
    "checking the details of this is left to the reader as an exercise .",
    "so now we can assume without loss of generality that the open set @xmath4 is bounded . and",
    "by translation we can now assume @xmath13 .",
    "we shall look for a biholomorphic mapping from @xmath4 to the unit disc @xmath14 which takes 0 to 0 .",
    "of course if there is a biholomorphic map from @xmath4 to the unit disc at all , there is one that takes 0 to 0 since a linear fractional transformation taking the unit disc @xmath14 to itself will take any given point to the origin , and in particular the image of 0 to begin with can be moved to the origin .",
    "now if @xmath15 is biholomorphic and has @xmath16 , then @xmath17 has a removable singularity at 0 . hence @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is holomorphic on @xmath4 and @xmath21 .",
    "that @xmath22 follows because @xmath18 is supposed to be one - to - one and hence must have derivative vanishing nowhere .",
    "of course @xmath23 is also nonzero for every other @xmath24 because 0 is the only point of @xmath4 with @xmath25 ,    now there is an antiderivative @xmath10 of @xmath26 on @xmath4 .",
    "the product@xmath27 is constant since it has derivative identically equal to 0 and @xmath4 is connected .",
    "changing @xmath10 by an additive constant , we can assume @xmath28 for all @xmath24 .",
    "( this familiar argument will occur several times here ) .",
    "the essential point of riemann s method was to consider the harmonic function @xmath29 .",
    "this is of course equal to @xmath30 .",
    "since the `` boundary values '' of @xmath31 have to be 1 , it must be that the boundary value of @xmath32 at a boundary point @xmath33 of @xmath4 has to be @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the harmonic function @xmath35 has to have boundary value at @xmath33 equal to @xmath36 .",
    "at this point , riemann appealed to what he referred to as the dirichlet principle .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the variational problem of minimizing the so - called dirichlet ( energy ) integral for a real valued function @xmath37 , namely minimizing this integral @xmath38~dxdy\\ ] ] under the condition that @xmath39 on the boundary @xmath40 of @xmath4 , is easily computed to satisfy @xmath41 (  18 of @xcite ) .",
    "so riemann proposed that the harmonic function with the boundary values @xmath36 at each boundary point @xmath33 could be found by minimization of the dirichlet integral .",
    "and riemann was well aware of how to construct @xmath20 and hence @xmath18 from knowing @xmath42 .",
    "riemann actually expressed this all in terms of @xmath43 and the idea of green s function , a function with boundary value 0 and a specified singularity at ( in our case ) the point 0 , namely the function had to be of the form @xmath44 with @xmath45 harmonic near the point 0 .",
    "this is equivalent for open sets in @xmath0 to our discussion , though the green s function notion is useful when one tries to extend the riemann mapping theorem to the uniformization problem where there is no _ a priori _",
    "global @xmath46-coordinate .",
    "the main difficulty is that there is no particular reason to suppose that there is in fact any minimum for the dirichlet integral in this situation .",
    "there is also a less serious difficulty of explaining why the resulting function is one - to - one and onto ",
    "intuitively this is just a matter of winding numbers if one can approximate @xmath4 from the inside by domains with smooth or piecewise - smooth closed curve boundaries .",
    "one supposes that riemann may have taken this part for obvious , though it is actually quite subtle if one does not appeal to any pre - existing topological intuitions",
    ". we shall give a precise argument later on .",
    "riemann apparently considers only domains the boundary of which is smooth in some sense .",
    "osgood made the major forward step treating simply connected open sets in general , thus proving what we call today the riemann mapping theorem .",
    "the osgood proof is acknowledged directly by carathodory @xcite where the ideas involved in the usual proof of today , via normal families , are presented .",
    "see the footnote ( * * ) of page 108 of @xcite .",
    "but for some reason , osgood s proof fell from favor or even recognition for the history of the theorem in @xcite ; there is a reference to osgood s paper but no comment on it , no acknowledgment that this is in fact the reasonably complete first proof of the general result .",
    "even simply connected bounded open sets in @xmath0 can have complicated boundaries .",
    "the boundary of the koch snowflake for example has hausdorff dimension greater than 1 @xcite .",
    "and osgood @xcite already gave an example with boundary having positive ( 2-dimensional ) measure .",
    "thus it is appropriate to introduce carefully what is to be meant by finding functions with specified boundary values . for this purpose ,",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded open set in @xmath0 and @xmath40 be its boundary , that is the complement of @xmath4 within the closure @xmath47 of @xmath4 in @xmath0 , or equivalently the intersection of @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "suppose that @xmath49 is a continuous function , then we say that a harmonic function @xmath50 is a solution of the dirichlet problem on @xmath4 with boundary values @xmath51 if the function `` @xmath52 '' is continuous on @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath52 is the function which equals @xmath20 on @xmath4 and equals @xmath51 on @xmath53 .",
    "the maximum principle shows immediately that if a given dirichlet problem has a solution , the solution is unique .",
    "but it is a fact that given @xmath4 and a function @xmath51 on @xmath40 , there may be no solution of the associated dirichlet problem .",
    "this is familiar but disconcerting in the present context since solving a dirichlet problem is the basic step in riemann s approach to the riemann mapping theorem , as already indicated .",
    "the easiest example of a dirichlet problem with no solution is @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 if @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for the failure is simple .",
    "uniqueness shows that any solution @xmath23 would have to depend on @xmath58 alone : the problem is rotationally symmetric so the solution would have to be .",
    "but the only such harmonic functions have the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constants .",
    "this follows easily by looking at the laplacian in polar coordinates .",
    "but clearly no such function solves the dirichlet problem mentioned .",
    "the open set @xmath62 is not simply connected . and",
    "it turns out that on a bounded simply connected open set @xmath4 , the dirichlet problem is solvable for every boundary function @xmath51 .",
    "this is the crucial piece of information needed in riemann s proof .",
    "this fact fits into a very general context .",
    "it turns out that the dirichlet problem with arbitrary boundary function @xmath51 will be solvable provided that no connected component of the complement of @xmath4 consists of a single point . since a simply connected open set ( in the topological sense ) has a connected but unbounded complement , the complement s one and only component can not consist of a single point",
    "! however , these points  the condition on the complement that guarantees the solution of the dirichlet problem and the fact that the complement of a simply connected open set is connected  are hard to establish .",
    "fortunately , a much simpler argument can be used to show that the dirichlet problem is always solvable on a bounded simply connected open set .",
    "this involves only the perron method , which has become a standard part of basic complex analysis courses",
    ". we can stay on familiar ground here .    in the more than seventy years from riemann",
    "s formulation of his mapping theorem to perron s paper @xcite on the solution of the dirichlet problem under the most general possible circumstances , results had been obtained on the solution of the dirichlet problem for open sets with various conditions of boundary regularity . in particular ,",
    "schwarz @xcite had shown that the problem was solvable if the boundary was piecewise analytic .",
    "every bounded open set @xmath4 can be approximated by open subsets @xmath63 with piecewise linear boundaries .",
    "for instance , as we shall discuss in detail momentarily , such @xmath63 can be taken to be a union of squares contained in @xmath4 . in effect , one lays a finely divided piece of graph paper ( a fine grid of squares ) over @xmath4 and takes @xmath63 to be the union of all the squares whose closure lies in @xmath4 .",
    "this method was used by osgood @xcite to construct a green function for @xmath4 relative to some fixed but arbitrary point of @xmath4 by taking a limit of green s functions of the sets @xmath63 of the sort just described , as one chose finer and finer grids on the plane . in this process ,",
    "simple connectivity was used ( as indeed it had to be ) in order to guarantee the convergence , and the form in which it was used was closely related to the barrier idea that occurs in perron s method .    in perron s method ,",
    "one begins with a bounded open set @xmath4 and a function @xmath51 on @xmath40 as before .",
    "then one offers as a candidate for the solution of the associated dirichlet problem the function @xmath64 on @xmath4 defined by @xmath65 , where the sup is taken over all ( continuous ) subharmonic functions @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67 for each @xmath68 .",
    "this function @xmath64 is always harmonic .",
    "but of course it need not have the function @xmath51 as boundary values .",
    "i.e. , it need not happen that @xmath69 is continuous on @xmath47 .",
    "this has to fail in some instances , since the dirichlet problem is not always solvable .",
    "perron undertook to find a general condition under which @xmath64 did have @xmath51 as boundary values .",
    "this condition involves the existence of what have come to be called _",
    "barrier functions_.    suppose that @xmath4 is a bounded open set in @xmath0 and @xmath70 is a boundary point of @xmath4 .",
    "a _ strong barrier _ , or sometimes just _ barrier _ , at @xmath70 is a continuous function @xmath45 defined on @xmath71 for some @xmath72 such that    * @xmath45 is subharmonic .",
    "* @xmath73 .",
    "* @xmath74 with limit taken over all @xmath46 in the domain of @xmath45 .",
    "* @xmath75 for every @xmath76 .",
    "a _ weak barrier _ is a function @xmath45 satisfying the same conditions except that the property ( 4 ) is omitted .",
    "perron s solution of the dirichlet problem is usually presented in complex analysis textbooks under the assumption that the bounded domain @xmath4 has the property that there is a strong barrier at each boundary point .",
    "however , g. bouligand showed soon after perron s original work that in fact it was enough to have a weak barrier at each boundary point .",
    "if @xmath4 is a bounded connected open set in @xmath0 with the property that for each boundary point @xmath70 of @xmath4 , there is a weak barrier defined on an open disc around @xmath70 , then , for any continous function @xmath51 on the boundary @xmath40 of @xmath4 , the perron upper envelope function @xmath64 associated to @xmath51 solves the dirichlet problem on @xmath4 with boundary values @xmath51",
    ", i.e. , @xmath64 is harmonic on @xmath4 and @xmath69 is continous on @xmath77 .    the details of this result can be found in @xcite and other standard texts on potential theory , e.g. @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the fact that _ weak barriers necessarily exist at boundary points of bounded open sets _ which are holomorphically simply connected .",
    "this is perhaps at first sight surprising since this condition of holomorphic simple connectivity seems to have nothing much to do with the existence of barriers .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "( this is essentially due to osgood in @xcite ) :    let @xmath78 be a point of @xmath40 .",
    "then the function @xmath79 , has no zeros in @xmath4 and hence there is a function @xmath80 such that @xmath81 by an argument already discussed .",
    "this requires only the holomorphic simple connectivitiy of @xmath4 .",
    "then the function @xmath10 is one - to - one on @xmath4 since @xmath82 implies @xmath83 so that @xmath84 and so @xmath85 .",
    "hence @xmath10 is a biholomorphic map of @xmath4 onto @xmath86 .",
    "the open set @xmath86 is unbounded because @xmath87 goes to @xmath88 as @xmath46 approaches @xmath78 .",
    "( note here that , by choice , @xmath78 is in @xmath40 so there are sequences of points in @xmath4 that approach @xmath78 ) . on the other hand , there is a positive real number @xmath60 such that @xmath89 for all @xmath24 .",
    "this is just because @xmath4 is bounded so @xmath90 is bounded on @xmath4 and @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that @xmath4 can be mapped biholomorphically onto a bounded open set @xmath63 which is contained in a disc bounded by a circle @xmath92 through 0 with 0 being in the boundary of the image of @xmath4 and with 0 corresponding to the boundary point @xmath78 .",
    "the precise meaning of this last is that for every sequence @xmath93 in @xmath4 converging to @xmath78 , the image sequence converges to 0 .",
    "this biholomorphic mapping is obtained by composing @xmath10 with a linear fractional transformation , say @xmath94 , that maps the line @xmath95 to a circle in @xmath0 in such a way that the image @xmath86 lies in the bounded component of the complement of the circle .",
    "( @xmath86 lies in the complement in the riemann sphere of @xmath96 ) . the image of @xmath97 via the linear fractional mapping @xmath94",
    "will then be the point 0 , and the point 0 lies on the the unit circle @xmath92 .",
    "the weak barrier for @xmath4 at the boundary point @xmath78 is now obtained by choosing an harmonic function which is 0 at 0 and negative on the circle @xmath92 and its interior .",
    "this could be chosen as a real linear function , for example .",
    "then one pulls this function back to @xmath4 by the composition of @xmath10 followed by the linear fractional transformation .    this barrier construction combined with the perron - bouligand result quoted guarantees that there is a harmonic function on any bounded holomorphically simply connected open set with @xmath20 having the boundary value @xmath98 for each @xmath99 , with @xmath4 as in the first section .",
    "we turn now to how to construct from this the biholomorphic map from @xmath4 to the unit disc @xmath14 and to the proof that the map constructed actually is biholomorphic .",
    "we continue the notations and conventions of the first section now .",
    "let @xmath100 be the harmonic function on @xmath4 which has the boundary values @xmath101 at each boundary point @xmath33 of @xmath4 . from this , we want to construct the function @xmath23 , which was presumed in the first section to exist as a matter of motivation .",
    "now we want to show that there is actually an @xmath23 like that , with @xmath102 being a biholomorphic map to the unit disc .    for this purpose ,",
    "let @xmath103 be a harmonic conjugate of @xmath104 , i.e. , a function such that @xmath105 is holomorphic .",
    "the holomorphic simple connectivity of @xmath4 implies the existence of @xmath106 as follows : the function @xmath107 is holomorphic on @xmath4 by the cauchy - riemann equations . if @xmath108 is a holomorphic anti - derivative of this function , and @xmath109 then @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath45 and @xmath104 have the same partial derivatives .",
    "hence @xmath112 is holomorphic so we can take @xmath106 to be @xmath113 .",
    "now set @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "then the function @xmath18 attains the value 0 exactly once , at @xmath116 , and with multiplicity 1 there .",
    "also , @xmath117 has boundary value 1 on @xmath4 in the sense that @xmath118 is continuous .",
    "this function @xmath18 is our candidate for being a biholomorphic map of @xmath4 onto the unit disc @xmath119 .",
    "it remains to see that this @xmath18 really is such a biholomorphic map .",
    "if @xmath4 were the interior of a smooth simple closed curve then one could envision a simple proof by considering the winding number around a given @xmath120 in the unit disc of a slight push - in of the boundary of @xmath4 .",
    "if the boundary were pushed in a small enough amount , then the image of the pushed - in boundary would be close to the edge of the unit disc .",
    "in particular , the line from 0 to @xmath120 would fail to intersect this image .",
    "thus the number of times that this image curve wound around @xmath120 would be the same as the number of times that the image curve wound around 0 , namely once , since the value 0 is attained exactly once inside the pushed - in curve in @xmath4 ( we assume the push - in is small enough that 0 is inside the pushed - in curve ) .",
    "this is a valid intuition .",
    "one rather suspects that riemann envisioned the situation in this way .",
    "unfortunately , this intuitive picture , while it can be made precise easily in the smooth boundary case , does not really apply to the general case . moreover , the idea that a simply connected region has a single boundary curve is not an easy one to check in detail .",
    "it is precisely such topological leaps of faith that we want to avoid .",
    "so we have to maneuver a bit to make a formal version of this intuition that makes no appeals to unverified and perhaps unverifiable topological intuitions .",
    "we shall provide a somewhat lengthy but not fundamentally difficult argument .",
    "we shall replace the push - in boundary curve by a boundary curve made up of the sides of squares .",
    "but we shall not need anything about the analogue of the push - in being the boundary of anything with specified properties .",
    "it might for example have several components or have self - intersections .",
    "we now proceed with the detailed construction .",
    "first , for each positive integer @xmath121 , consider all the closed squares in the plane of the form @xmath122 here @xmath123 and @xmath124 are integers but not necessarily positive integers .",
    "these squares cover the plane and any two distinct ones intersect at most at a vertex or an edge of each .",
    "we set @xmath125 the collection of triples @xmath126 such that the associated square @xmath127 is completely contained in @xmath4 and @xmath128 the union of these associated squares .",
    "note that each square has a natural orientation so that it makes sense for example to integrate a complex valued function continuous in a neighborhood of the union of the edges of the square around the four edges taken together as a closed curve .",
    "now suppose that @xmath1 is a complex valued function which is continuous in a neighborhood of all the edges of squares labeled by elements in @xmath129 .",
    "then the sum of the integrals over the edges of each of the squares @xmath127 , @xmath130 , is defined .",
    "if an edge is shared by two squares in this collection , it occurs in one square with opposite orientation from the orientation it has from the other square .",
    "thus we arrive at the result that the sum of the integrals of the four - edge boundary curves of the squares associated to @xmath129 equals the integral of the function around the boundary edges of @xmath131 , where a boundary edge is by definition one which occurs in one of the @xmath127 squares with @xmath132 but is not shared with any other @xmath129 square .",
    "if @xmath133 is any compact subset in @xmath4 then there is an @xmath134 so large that , if @xmath135 , then @xmath133 is contained in @xmath136 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the interiors of the @xmath131 form an increasing sequence of open sets with union equal to @xmath4 . with these ideas in mind",
    ", we formulate as a lemma the basic result we shall use .",
    "the lemma refers back to the function @xmath18 defined in the previous section .",
    "suppose that @xmath137 is a real number with @xmath138 .",
    "then there is an @xmath139 such that , if @xmath140 , then the interior of @xmath131 contains @xmath141 . moreover . for any such fixed @xmath142 ,",
    "the number of times that @xmath18 attains a value @xmath143 with @xmath144 ( and hence the number of times it attains the value @xmath120 in @xmath4 ) is exactly the integral @xmath145 around the boundary edges of @xmath131 .",
    "the first statement follows easily from the fact that @xmath43 has boundary values 0 on @xmath4 .",
    "this implies immediately that there is a @xmath146 such that @xmath147 at every point @xmath24 with @xmath148 ( this comes from uniform continuity of the function @xmath149 on @xmath77 . if @xmath150 is so large that the diameter of the squares of side length @xmath151 is less than @xmath152 , then the first conclusion holds since being outside of @xmath131 would imply distance to the boundary of @xmath4 less than @xmath146 so that no point outside @xmath131 could have @xmath18 image with absolute value less than @xmath137 .",
    "the second conclusion is more or less immediate if no point on the sides of the square labeled by @xmath129 contains a point in the inverse image of @xmath120 : for each @xmath129 labeled square , the integral @xmath153 around the edges of the square counts the number of preimages ( counting multiplicity ) of @xmath120 inside the square .",
    "the total number of preimages of @xmath120 is obtained by adding up the numbers in each of the @xmath129 labeled squares and this gives the integral @xmath154 around the boundary edges .",
    "this argument does not apply if a preimage of @xmath120 is actually on the edge of a square labeled in @xmath129 .",
    "however , since the set of preimages of @xmath120 must be finite in number ( since they all lie in a compact set ) , we can deal with this problem as follows : redo the whole construction with the squares with the center of the square grid at @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is a positive number very close to 0 so that the squares are of the form @xmath157 if @xmath156 is close enough to 0 , it will still be true that the union @xmath158 of the squares @xmath159 , @xmath130 , is contained in @xmath4",
    ". it will also be the case that the interior of the union @xmath158 contains @xmath160 , again for all @xmath161 small enough . and for a fixed @xmath120 with @xmath162 , one can arrange that the edges of these @xmath129 labeled squares do not contain any preimage of @xmath120 so that the previous case applies . however , the integral @xmath163 around the boundary edges of @xmath158 is a continous function of @xmath156 so that , as @xmath156 is made to approach 0 , one obtains the desired conclusion as a limit .",
    "the point here is that preimages of @xmath120 might lie on interior edges of the @xmath129 labeled squares but they can not lie on the boundary edges so that the integral over the union of the boundary edges is a continuous function of @xmath120 .",
    "now we can complete the argument that @xmath18 attains each value @xmath120 in the unit disc exactly once .",
    "given @xmath120 with @xmath164 , choose an @xmath137 with @xmath165 .",
    "the lemma shows that the number of @xmath166 of a point @xmath46 in the set @xmath167 is integer - valued and moreover , since it is given by the integral @xmath153 over the boundary edges of @xmath131 for all suitably large @xmath121 , it must be continuous as a function of @xmath120 .",
    "hence it is everywhere 1 on @xmath168 because the point 0 has exactly one preimage counting multiplicity , namely the point 0 .",
    "thus @xmath18 attains the alue @xmath120 exactly once counting multiplicity .",
    "hence @xmath18 is one - to - one and onto the unit disc . @xmath169",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the argument in this last section is specific to the situation at hand , but the result is in fact a special case of a general consideration , namely that a proper map of one ( connected ) riemann surface to another is a branched covering with all points in the image space having the same number of pre - images counting multiplicity .",

    "<S> this article presents a rigorous proof of the riemann mapping theorem via riemann s method , uncompromised by any appeals to topological intuition .    </S>",
    "<S> the riemann mapping theorem is one of the most remarkable results of nineteenth century mathematics . even today , more than a hundred fifty years later , the fact that every proper simply connected open subset of the complex plane is biholomorphically equivalent to every other seems deep and profound . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a result that has become in any sense obvious with the passage of time and the general expansion of mathematics . and at the time , the theorem must have been truly startling . </S>",
    "<S> even gauss , never easily impressed , viewed the result favorably , though he had reservations about the summary nature of riemann s writings . at the time , riemann s method appeared hard to carry out in detail . </S>",
    "<S> and indeed there have been those since who believed it could not be carried out in detail at all .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , when a different proof arose later on using montel s idea of normal families , this proof established itself as standard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is rare to find any other proof than the normal families one in contemporary texts on complex analysis . </S>",
    "<S> only if the student of complex analysis goes on to study uniformization of open riemann surfaces is riemann s original idea likely to be encountered . at best </S>",
    "<S> , the original proof idea is relegated to exercises or brief summaries in texts on basic complex analysis ( cf . , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , exercise 73 , p.  251 in @xcite , or section 5.2 , p.  249 - 251 in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> and yet , in the historical view , riemann s proposed method of proof was as interesting and perhaps even more important than the result itself . </S>",
    "<S> it would have been almost impossible for anyone listening to riemann s presentation in 1851 to have imagined that what they were hearing was the first instance of a mathematical method that would become a massive part of geometric mathematics in the decades to come and that continues to be a vitally active subject today . </S>",
    "<S> but so it was , for riemann s proof method for his mapping theorem marked the introduction of the use of elliptic equations and the solution of elliptic variational problems to treat geometric questions . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic theory of riemann surfaces via harmonic forms and hodge s generalization to algebraic varieties in higher dimensions ; the circle of results known by the name the bochner technique ; the theory of minimal submanifolds and its applications to topology of manifolds ; the use of elliptic methods in 4-manifold theory ; and , most recently , the proof of the poincar conjecture and the geometrization conjecture that extends it  all these and much more could not have been anticipated in any detail on that historic day at the time riemann presented his mapping theorem . </S>",
    "<S> but in retrospect , when riemann suggested constructing the biholomorphic map to the unit disc that his result called for by solving an elliptic variational problem , the whole development began . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that riemann could not in fact actually prove what he called dirichlet s principle is almost beside the point . </S>",
    "<S> he had found the way into the thicket . </S>",
    "<S> chopping the path onward could be and would be done by others .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seemed to the authors unfortunate that finding a precise and complete discussion of how actually to carry out riemann s argument is not easy . </S>",
    "<S> osgood s proof @xcite of the riemann mapping theorem  usually regarded as the first reasonably complete proof , correct except for certain topological details being brushed over  does indeed use riemann s general idea . </S>",
    "<S> but it is made more difficult than need be today because he was not in possession of the perron method of solving the dirichlet problem . </S>",
    "<S> thus he had to work with piecewise linear approximations from the interior and take limits of the piecewise linear ( even piecewise real analytic ) case of the dirichlet problem that had been solved by schwarz already at that time @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal in this article is to present a clear proof of the riemann mapping theorem via riemann s method , uncompromised by any appeals to topological intuition . </S>",
    "<S> such intuitions are notoriously unreliable and , even if correct , can be surprisingly hard to substantiate . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one of the most intriguing features of the riemann mapping theorem is that it provides a proof of the strictly topological fact that any simply connected open subset of the plane is homeomorphic to any other . </S>",
    "<S> since one wishes to deduce this topological conclusion , it is particularly desirable not to appeal to any unproven topological facts in the proof of the riemann mapping theorem itself . </S>",
    "<S> ( that simple connectivity of a domain in the plane implies homeomorphism to the plane [ or the disc ] can be shown directly , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> theorem 6.4 , p.  149 in @xcite </S>",
    "<S>  but it is a delicate and intricate matter ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic method is riemann s , but in the intervening years the perron solution of the dirichlet problem for any bounded domain with barriers at each boundary point has simplified the basic construction . that there are barriers at each point of the boundary of a simply connected bounded open set in @xmath0 does hold . </S>",
    "<S> this was in effect pointed out by osgood , though the barrier terminology was not in use at that time . putting this together with some arguments about winding numbers and counting preimages </S>",
    "<S> will complete the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> _ acknowledgments_. the authors are indebted to d. marshall for helpful comments about a preliminary version of this paper , in regard to weak and strong barriers in particular . </S>"
