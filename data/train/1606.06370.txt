    "the @xmath2-_token graph _ @xmath4 of @xmath0 is the graph whose vertices are all the @xmath2-subsets of @xmath6 and two @xmath2-subsets are adjacent if their symmetric difference is an edge of @xmath0 . in particular , observe that @xmath13 and @xmath0 are isomorphic , which , as usual , is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , note also that @xmath15 for any admissible @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) . often , throughout this paper",
    ", we simply write token graph instead of @xmath2-token graph .",
    "the origins of the notion of token graphs can be dated back at least to 2002 when terry rudolph @xcite used @xmath4 to study the graph isomorphism problem .",
    "in such a work rudolph gave examples of non - isomorphic graphs @xmath0 and @xmath16 which are cospectral , but with @xmath17 and @xmath18 non - cospectral .",
    "he emphasized this fact by saying the following about the eigenvalues of @xmath17 :  then the eigenvalues of this larger matrix are a graph invariant , and in fact are a more powerful invariant than those of the original matrix @xmath0 \" .",
    "five years later , this notion was extended by audenaert et al . in @xcite to any integer @xmath2 such that @xmath19 , calling to @xmath4 the _ symmetric @xmath2-@xmath5 power of @xmath0_. in @xcite was proved that the @xmath20-token graphs of strongly regular graphs with the same parameters are cospectral and some connections with generic exchange hamiltonians in quantum mechanics were also discussed .",
    "following rudolph s study , barghi and ponomarenko @xcite and alzaga et al .",
    "@xcite proved , independently , that for a given positive integer @xmath2 there exists infinitely many pairs of non - isomorphic graphs with cospectral @xmath2-token graphs .    in 2012",
    "ruy fabila - monroy et al .",
    "@xcite reintroduced , independently , the concept of @xmath2-token graphs  as a model in which @xmath2 indistinguishable tokens move from vertex to vertex along the edges of a graph \" and began the systematic study of the combinatorial parameters of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the investigation presented in @xcite includes the study of connectivity , diameter , cliques , chromatic number , hamiltonian paths , and cartesian products of token graphs . following this line of research , in 2015 , fabila - monroy and three of the authors of this paper presented results about the planarity and the regularity of token graphs @xcite .    from the model of @xmath4",
    "proposed in @xcite it is clear that the @xmath2-token graphs can be considered as part of several models of swapping in the literature @xcite that are part of reconfiguration problems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the pebble motion ( pm ) problem of determining if an arrangement @xmath21 of @xmath22 distinct pebbles numbered @xmath23 and placed on @xmath2 distinct vertices of @xmath0 can be transformed into another given arrangement @xmath24 by moving the pebbles along edges of @xmath0 provided that at any given time at most one pebble is traveling along an edge and each vertex of @xmath0 contains at most one pebble , has been studied in  @xcite and  @xcite from the algorithmic point of view .",
    "also , in such papers several applications of the pm problem have been mentioned , which include the management of memory in totally distributed computing systems and problems in robot motion planning . on the other hand ,",
    "note that the pm problem is a variant of the problem of determining the diameter of @xmath4 ( the only difference is that in the pm problem , the pebbles or tokens are distiguishable ) .",
    "the @xmath2-token graphs also are a generalization of johnson graphs : if @xmath0 is the complete graph of order @xmath1 , then @xmath4 is isomorphic to the johnson graph @xmath25 .",
    "the johnson graphs have been studied from several approaches , see for example  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the determination of the exact value of the independence number @xmath26 of the johnson graph , as far as we know , remains open in its generality , albeit it has been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "possibly , the last effort to determine @xmath26 was made by k. g. mirajkar et al . in 2016  @xcite . in such a work they presented an exact formula for @xmath26 , which is unfortunately wrong :",
    "the independence number of @xmath27 is @xmath28 because it is equal to the distance-4 constant wight code @xmath29  @xcite , but the formula in  @xcite gives @xmath30 .",
    "the graph parameters of interest in this paper are the independence number and the matching number . a set @xmath31 of vertices in a graph @xmath0 is an _",
    "independent set _ if no two vertices in @xmath31 are adjacent ; a _ maximal independent set _ is an independent set such that it is not a proper subset of any independent set in @xmath0 .",
    "the _ independence number _ @xmath32 of @xmath0 is the number of vertices in a largest independent set in @xmath0 , and its computation is np - hard  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recall that the _ matching number _ @xmath33 of @xmath0 is the number of edges of any largest matching in @xmath0 .",
    "a matching @xmath34 of @xmath0 is called _ perfect matching _",

    "similarly , @xmath38 if and only if @xmath0 has an almost perfect matching .",
    "in this case , jack edmonds proved in 1965 that the matching number of a graph can be determined in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "our main results in this paper are theorems [ th : match ] , [ th : kmn ] and [ k2cicle ] .    in our attempt to estimate the independence number of the token graphs of certain families of bipartite graphs , we meet the following natural question :    * question 1 . * if @xmath39 , what can we say about @xmath7 ?    in theorem",
