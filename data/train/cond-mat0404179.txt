    "the discovery of high temperature superconductors , in which thermal fluctuations are important and mean field theory can no longer be applied , has led to a resurgence of interest in phase transitions and critical phenomena in type - ii superconductors.@xcite of particular interest has been understanding the effects of random quenched disorder on the nature of the ordered phases and the universality of the phase transitions . for the high temperature superconductors",
    ", this quenched disorder can take many forms : random point defects due to oxygen vacancies , planar twin grain boundaries , and columnar defects introduced by ion irradiation .",
    "most of the work in this area has focused on the case of a finite applied magnetic field , where one seeks to understand how the randomness distorts or destroys the abrikosov lattice of magnetic field induced vortex lines that forms in a pure system .",
    "columnar defects@xcite have received considerable attention , as they are particularly effective in pinning vortex lines and reducing flux flow resistance .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we will focus on the effect of columnar defects on the superconducting phase transition in _",
    "zero _ applied magnetic field .",
    "we expect this case to be interesting for the following reason .",
    "a generalized harris criterion@xcite argues that disorder will be a relevant perturbation , and change the universality class of a phase transition , whenever @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of dimensions in which the system is disordered , and @xmath4 is the usual correlation length critical exponent . for a disorder free superconductor ,",
    "the transition in zero applied magnetic field is in the universality class of the three dimensional ( 3d ) xy model,@xcite for which @xmath5 . for random _ point _ disorder , @xmath6 , so @xmath7 , and the generalized harris criterion argues that the universality of the transition remains unchanged . for _ columnar _ disorder , however , @xmath8 , and so @xmath2 .",
    "columnar defects should therefore cross the zero field transition over to a new universality class .",
    "stability@xcite of this new disordered fixed point with respect to the generalized harris criterion implies that it should have a new value @xmath9 . in our equilibrium simulations we indeed find behavior consistent with this , and",
    "we obtain a value for the correlation length exponent @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we find scaling is now anistropic and we find the value of the anisotropy exponent to be @xmath1 .",
    "experimental measurement of these exponents would therefore provide a precision test of the theoretical model .",
    "the model we study also has application to the @xmath10 superconductor to insulator quantum phase transition in two dimensional thin films with random substrate disorder,@xcite and to the mott transition for bosons in 2d optical lattices with the addition of random scattered laser intensity .",
    "@xcite in these cases , the two dimensional quantum problem can be mapped onto a corresponding three dimensional classical problem with the same symmetries as the one we study here.@xcite    to study the effect of columnar disorder on the zero field transition of a type - ii superconductor , we will consider two different limits .",
    "the first is the limit of an  unscreened \" superconductor@xcite in which magnetic field fluctuations are frozen out , corresponding to the approximation of an infinite bare magnetic penetration length , @xmath11 . here",
    ", vortex line segments have long ranged coulombic - like interactions .",
    "for the extreme type - ii high temperature superconductors , for which @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bare coherence length that also sets the radius of a vortex line core , the unscreened model should give a good description except in an _ extremely _ narrow temperature window about the transition.@xcite    the second limit is that of a strongly screened superconductor,@xcite corresponding to the case @xmath14 . in this case ,",
    "vortex line segments have short range interactions",
    ". this description should also become valid extremely close to the transition when the diverging correlation length @xmath15 becomes comparable to the renormalized magnetic penetration length @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and magnetic field fluctuations on such large length scales must be included in determining the true critical behavior .",
    "this region near @xmath18 may , however , be too small to observe in practice.@xcite    as in the disorder free case , a duality transformation@xcite establishes that these two limits lie in the same universality class as regards equilibrium critical behavior .",
    "they may be different , however , for dynamic critical behavior.@xcite in this work we carry out detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the xy model for the unscreened superconductor to determine the equilibrium critical exponents , and we demonstrate the presence of anisotropic scaling ; by duality , these exponents also apply to the strongly screened case . then , using simple local monte carlo dynamics , we compute the dynamic critical exponent for both the unscreened xy model , and for the strongly screened vortex loop model .",
    "we find that the dynamic exponent is different for these two limits .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organzied as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the xy model and the loop model for the unscreened and strongly screened limits , respectively . the duality transformation between the two",
    "is given in appendix a. in section iii we discuss the equilibrium critical behavior of the xy model , presenting our finite size scaling analysis , defining the observables we measure , and giving the numerical results of our simulations . in section iv we discuss the dynamic critical behavior of the xy and loop models , within a simple local monte carlo dynamics .",
    "we define the observables we measure and give our numerical results . in section",
    "v we give our discussion and conclusions .",
    "to model the effects of thermal fluctuations in a type - ii superconductor , we start with the commonly used 3d xy model.@xcite this models the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter in the  unscreened \" limit where magnetic field fluctuations are frozen out , corresponding to the approximation of an infinite bare magnetic penetration length , @xmath11 . for zero applied magnetic field we have , @xmath19=-\\sum_{i,\\mu}j_{i\\mu}\\cos(\\theta_i-\\theta_{i+\\hat\\mu})\\enspace . \\label{ehxy}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 represents the phase angle of the complex superconducting order parameter on node @xmath21 of a periodic cubic grid of @xmath22 sites , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "the sum is over all nearest neighbor bonds @xmath23 of the grid , with @xmath24 , and the cosine term represents the kinetic energy of fluctuating supercurrents .",
    "the short length cutoff of the discrete grid models the bare vortex core size @xmath13 .    in a pure system ,",
    "the couplings @xmath25 are all equal , except for a possible variation with bond direction @xmath26 . here",
    ", we take the @xmath25 randomly distributed in order to model quenched random columnar defects . for the work reported on here , with columnar defects aligned parallel to the @xmath27 axis",
    ", we have chosen the following distribution : in the @xmath27 direction , we take all @xmath28 ; in the @xmath29 plane , we take @xmath25 , @xmath30 , distributed equally likely with the two values @xmath31 and @xmath32 , keeping the @xmath25 translationally invariant along the @xmath27 axis so as to model columnar disorder .",
    "note that the random @xmath25 introduce no frustration into the system ; in the ground state all the @xmath20 are equal . the variations in the @xmath25 result in spatially random pinning energies for vortex loop excitations of the phase angles @xmath20 .",
    "we have chosen the above bimodal distribution for @xmath25 to give strong pinning energies ( for fixed average @xmath25 ) , so as to be able to approach the asymptotic scaling limit with reasonable size systems .    although we will simulate the hamiltonian of eq.([ehxy ] ) using periodic boundary conditions on the phase angles @xmath20 , it is useful to consider a more general _ fixed twist _",
    "boundary condition , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a fixed ( non - fluctuating ) total twist in the phase angle applied across the system in direction @xmath35 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions correspond to the twist @xmath36 . transforming to new variables , @xmath37 the hamiltonian of eq.([ehxy ] )",
    "becomes , @xmath38=-\\sum_{i,\\mu}j_{i\\mu}\\cos(\\theta^\\prime_i-\\theta^\\prime_{i+\\hat\\mu}-\\delta_\\mu / l_\\mu)\\enspace , \\label{ehxy2}\\ ] ] where the @xmath39 obey periodic boundary conditions , @xmath40 .",
    "using the fact that the cosine is periodic in @xmath41 , the partition function integrals over @xmath42 can be taken over the interval @xmath43 , as were the integrals over the original phase angles @xmath20 .",
    "considering how the free energy varies with the twist @xmath34 will be useful later for discussing phase coherence in the model .",
    "although we carry out our equilibrium simulations directly in terms of the xy model of eq.([ehxy ] ) , we also consider a different formulation of the model . if instead of the cosine interaction of eq.([ehxy ] ) , one uses the periodic gaussian interaction of villain,@xcite then a standard duality transformation@xcite ( see appendix a ) maps the xy model , @xmath44 , onto a model of sterically interacting loops , @xmath45 , where , @xmath46 the @xmath47 are integer valued variables on the bonds @xmath23 and satisfy a divergenceless constraint , @xmath48=0\\enspace . \\label{en}\\ ] ] the @xmath47 thus form connected paths through the system that must eventually close upon themselves .",
    "the couplings @xmath49 of eq.([ehloop ] ) are related to the couplings of the xy model by , @xmath50 where the temperature scale of the loop model , @xmath51 , is inverted with respect to the temperature scale of the xy model , @xmath52 .",
    "while the loop model of eq.([ehloop ] ) is exactly dual to the xy model of an _ unscreened _ superconductor , taking it on its own with @xmath51 as the physical temperature , we can give @xmath53 the following different physical interpretation.@xcite we can regard the divergenceless variables @xmath47 as the vortex loops of a _ strongly screened _ superconductor with @xmath14 .",
    "the short ranged vortex line interaction of this case is then modeled by the simple onsite repulsion of @xmath53 .",
    "further details of this analogy may be found in ref ..",
    "if we regard each site of our numerical grid as representing a columnar pin , the random @xmath49 in the @xmath29 plane can be thought of as modeling the random distances between such pins , and hence giving the random energies associated with a vortex loop segment hopping from one pin to another .",
    "this duality between @xmath53 and @xmath54 thus implies that the unscreened and the screened superconductor models fall in the same equilibrium universality class , just as is the case for the disorder free model.@xcite",
    "in this section we report on our equilibrium xy model simulations . to extract critical exponents ,",
    "we use the method of finite size scaling .",
    "we first , therefore , discuss this method .      because the columnar disorder singles out the special direction @xmath27 , we must allow for the possibility that scaling will be anisotropic .",
    "if @xmath15 denotes the correlation length in the @xmath29 plane , then anisotropic scaling assumes that , as @xmath55 and @xmath15 diverges , the correlation length along the @xmath27 axis diverges as , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the anisotropy exponent .",
    "consider now an observable @xmath58 whose scaling dimension is zero . as a function of reduced temperature @xmath59 and system size @xmath60 , we expect the scaling relationship , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an arbitrary length rescaling factor , @xmath63 is the scaling function , and @xmath4 is the usual correlation length exponent , @xmath64 taking @xmath65 in eq,([escale ] ) then gives , @xmath66 for the case of _ isotropic _ scaling , with @xmath67 , choosing a constant aspect ratio @xmath68 reduces the right hand side of eq.([escale2 ] ) to a function of the single scaling variable @xmath69 . measuring @xmath58",
    "vs. @xmath52 for systems with varying @xmath70 but fixed @xmath71 is then sufficient to determine the exponent @xmath4 .",
    "however when @xmath72 , and its value is unknown , it becomes necessary to consider systems with varying aspect ratio @xmath71 , greatly increasing the complexity of the computation .    to deal with this case",
    "we take the following approach , originally used to study the phase transition in the quantum ising spin glass.@xcite assume that the observable @xmath73 when viewed as a function of @xmath74 , for fixed @xmath52 and @xmath70 , has a maximum at a particular value @xmath75 .",
    "because of the scaling law eq.([escale2 ] ) , this value @xmath76 must occur when @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a scaling function of the single variable @xmath69 .",

    "in practice , we will determine the values of @xmath18 and the exponent @xmath4 by the following approach.@xcite close to @xmath18 ( i.e for small @xmath83 ) we can expand the scaling function @xmath84 as a polynomial for small values of its argument @xmath69 , @xmath85l^{1/\\nu}+a_2\\left([(t - t_c)/t_c]l^{1/\\nu } \\right)^2+\\dots \\label{epoly}\\ ] ] we then fit the data for @xmath80 to the above form using @xmath18 , @xmath4 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 as free fitting parameters . varying the system sizes",
    "@xmath70 and temperature window @xmath89 of the data used in the fit , as well as varying the order of the above polynomial expansion , will give confidence on the significance of the fit .",

    "consider first a general @xmath41 periodic interaction @xmath165 instead of the @xmath166 of eq.([ehxy ] ) .",
    "for the generalized fixed twist boundary condition and the corresponding hamiltonian of eq.([ehxy2 ] ) , we can write the partition function as , @xmath167 where the @xmath39 obey periodic boundary conditions . defining the fourier transform @xmath168 by , @xmath169 and substituting into eq.([ezxy ] ) gives , @xmath170}\\left(\\prod_{i}\\int_0^{2\\pi}{d\\theta^\\prime_i\\over 2\\pi}\\right){\\rm e}^{i\\sum_{j\\mu}n_{j\\mu}(\\theta^\\prime_j-\\theta^\\prime_{j+\\hat\\mu})}\\enspace . \\label{ez2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one is now free to do the integrals over the @xmath171 .",
    "the result is a product of kronecker deltas constraining the variables @xmath172 to be divergenceless , as in eq.([en ] ) . defining the  winding numbers \" @xmath173 by , @xmath174 we get , @xmath175 where the prime on the summation denotes the divergenceless constraint of eq.([en ] ) .",
    "a common choice for @xmath165 is the villain interaction,@xcite @xmath176 in this case one has for its transform , @xmath177 the partition function of eq,([ez3 ] ) , with periodic boundary conditions @xmath36 , then becomes , @xmath178 with @xmath179 the above is just a model of short ranged interacting loops with onsite repulsion @xmath180 and inverted temperature scale @xmath181 .    for our simulatons , with @xmath182 , one has@xcite @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "since @xmath184 is an increasing function of @xmath185 for fixed @xmath186 , the above similarly gives a short ranged loop model with onsite repulsion .",
    "it is this interaction of eq.([ein ] ) that we use in our dynamic simulations of the loop model in section iv .",
    "we can now demonstrate several interesting results concerning phase coherence in the xy model , by considering the behavior as a function of the twist @xmath34 .",
    "the xy model is phase coherent when the total free energy @xmath104 varies with @xmath34 . using @xmath187 , and eq.([ez3 ] ) above , we find , @xmath188 where @xmath189 indicates an average in the ensemble with @xmath36 . now since @xmath190 must be a real quantity ( as may be seen by considering its evaluation in the original xy model @xmath54 of eq.([ehxy2 ] ) ) , and since @xmath191 must similarly be real ( as may be seen by considering @xmath53 ) , the only way for eq.([ef1 ] ) to hold is if @xmath192 .",
    "this then demonstrates that @xmath36 , i.e. periodic boundary conditions on the @xmath20 , is the twist that minimizes the free energy .    finally , returning to eq.([ez3 ] ) , we note that in the _ fluctuating twist _",
    "ensemble@xcite for the xy model , in which @xmath34 is averaged over as a thermally fluctuating degree of freedom , the corresponding loop model obeys the additional constraint of zero winding , @xmath193 , in each individual configuration .",
    "when viewing @xmath53 as the hamiltonian of vortex loops in a strongly screened superconductor , this corresponds to the ensemble in which the average internal magnetic field is constrained to vanish , @xmath194 , in each configuration .      for reviews",
