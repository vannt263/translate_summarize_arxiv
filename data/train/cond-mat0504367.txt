    "long - range spin models have drawn increasing interest in the last decade , both in the microscopic modeling of a variety of systems ranging from model alloys @xcite to spin glasses @xcite to neural networks @xcite , and as powerful laboratory frame to investigate fundamental issues in the physics of critical phenomena .",
    "these include , e.g. , the effect of dimensionality @xcite , the crossover from short - range to long - range behavior @xcite , mean - field driven phase transitions @xcite , and possible connections with tsallis s non - extensive thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) methods have now gained a prominent role in the investigation of phase transitions in these models @xcite .",
    "in particular , a major breakthrough was recently initiated by the introduction of a ( canonical ) cluster algorithm able to overcome the algorithm complexity inherent to long - range ( lr ) models , namely , the need to take a huge number of interactions into account at each monte carlo step ( mcs ) @xcite . in a recent article",
    ", we proposed a generalization of this algorithm to simulations in the multicanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of the present work to introduce a general and versatile method aimed at embedding any cluster update scheme in a flat histogram algorithm , with special emphasis given to lr spin models .    whether short- or long - range interactions are considered , canonical mc simulations of long - range spin models suffer indeed from severe shortcomings , the use of cluster updates notwithstanding .",
    "first and foremost , models exhibiting first order phase transitions or complicated energy landscapes experience supercritical slowing down @xcite : the time needed for the dynamics to tunnel through free energy barriers grows exponentially with the lattice size , leading to quasi ergodicity breaking and unreliable statistics .",
    "second , the computation of free energies and related thermodynamic quantities is highly involved , and a precise determination of the order of the transition is often intractable . in practice , these shortcomings preclude the use of canonical mc algorithms at first - order transitions except at modest lattice sizes and in the case of weakly first - order transitions .    an efficient approach aimed at overcoming this limitation is the simulation in generalized ensembles @xcite , in particular its multicanonical flavor initially proposed by berg @xcite , reconsidered in the context of transition matrix dynamics @xcite and recently revisited by wang and landau @xcite .",
    "the key - idea here is to artificially enhance rare events corresponding to local maxima in the free energy , by feeding the markov chain with an appropriate distribution @xmath3 . in the _ multicanonical ensemble _ , @xmath3 is set to the inverse of the density of states , so that the resulting dynamics is a random walk in the energy space that yields a flat histogram of the energy .",
    "other ensembles have been proposed in the last decade , including the @xmath4 ensemble , which enhances low - energy states @xcite , and very recently , the optimal ensemble , which aims at optimizing the distribution @xmath3 with respect to the local diffusivity of the random walker , so that tunneling times are minimized @xcite .",
    "while still broad , histograms engendered by these last ensembles are no longer flat ; in the optimal ensemble for instance , the histogram is slightly peaked around the critical region , so that the larger time spent by the random walker inside the critical region compensates the lower diffusivity in this region .    when implemented through",
    "local ( i.e. , single - spin ) updates @xcite , simulations in the multicanonical ensemble suffer , however , from two serious hurdles .",
    "first , while tunneling times  measured in monte carlo steps ( mcs )  are reduced from an exponential to a power law @xmath5 of the lattice size , the dynamic exponents @xmath6 are still substantially higher than the ideal value @xmath7 that should be expected from the dynamics of a random walker @xcite .",
    "this observation , as we will witness in this article , applies equally well to effective autocorrelation times and to equilibrium times ; this represents a serious hindrance in terms of scalability , in particular whenever a higher precision is desired and large amounts of decorrelated data need to be gathered . in this respect , it is important to mention that correlations between successive measurements do not only have an impact on the statistical efficiency of multicanonical production runs , yet also represent a source of systematic error regarding the estimation of the density of states @xcite . a second impediment to the scalability of local - update implementations specifically relates to long - range models . here , the very presence of long - range interactions makes the computation of the energy  an essential ingredient of multicanonical methods  a very time consuming operation , namely , one associated with an @xmath8 algorithm complexity . as a result",
    ", the demand on cpu time needed to generate perfectly decorrelated statistics grows as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .    in this article",
    ", we present a monte carlo method which successfully tackles these issues by performing simulations in the multicanonical ensemble using collective updates .",
    "our methods combines the fast - decorrelating capabilities of cluster algorithms with the versatility of flat - histogram methods in an efficient and straightforward way , and with wide applicability in view .",
    "in particular , it can be readily combined with any iteration scheme dedicated to the estimation of the density of states , e.g. , wang - landau s method @xcite or transition matrix algorithms @xcite . additionally , while our method is presented here in the context of long - range spin models , where it gives drastic improvements over commonly used methods , it is perfectly applicable to any class of models for which a cluster algorithm exists in the canonical ensemble .",
    "noteworthy enough , embedding a collective update scheme in a multicanonical algorithm is not straightforward , however , due to the fundamentally _ non - local _ nature of the multicanonical weight @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , cluster algorithms depend heavily upon particular symmetries of the model hamiltonian , which @xmath3 does not keep track of ; in particular , there is no longer a canonical temperature . with simulations of spin models with nearest - neighbors interactions in view ,",
    "several attempts have been made at combining cluster updates with multicanonical methods in some way or another during the last decade : the multibond algorithm @xcite or variants thereof targeting wang - landau s algorithm @xcite simulate the model in its spin - bond representation ; rummukainen s hybrid - like two - step algorithm lumps together a microcanonical cluster algorithm and a multicanonical daemon refresh @xcite . as opposed to these , however , our method relies on a cluster - building process which simply depends on the microcanonical temperature of the current configuration  a quantity that may be readily derived from the estimated density of states  in order to determine appropriate bond probabilities . in particular , it does not require prior knowledge of the transition temperature , as is the case in the multibond method .",
    "we further show that our approach makes it particularly straightforward to incorporate two optimization schemes dedicated to lr models @xcite , which cut down the algorithm complexity from @xmath8 to @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", the total demand on cpu time with respect to uncorrelated data is reduced to approximately @xmath12 , since cluster updates also lower @xmath6 to around @xmath13 ; where lr models are concerned , the benefit of cluster updates is thus clearly twofold .",
    "let us also mention that , as a by - product , using cluster updates provides improved estimators for the statistical moments of the order parameter @xcite and for spin - spin correlation functions ; for instance , the last quantity can be better estimated by counting the fraction of time two given sites belong to the same cluster @xcite .",
    "further interesting information , including information connected with fractal geometry , may also be gleaned from cluster statistics @xcite .",
    "overall , the sharp reduction of the computer load brought about by our method allowed us to study @xmath0-state potts chains with @xmath14 interactions containing up to @xmath2 spins in a few days on a modern intel - based computer .",
    "it must be noted that , with standard multicanonical methods based on single - spin updates , such huge sizes are simply intractable , since the largest size of @xmath2 investigated in this work would demand several months of computation .",
    "as regards dynamic performance , we obtain a substantial reduction in the dynamic exponent , from e.g. , @xmath15 to @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we also show that our method produces faster equilibration , lower effective autocorrelation times , and  where implementations based on the wang - landau algorithm are concerned  lower statistical errors in the estimate of the density of states , e.g. , of nearly an order of magnitude for @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 spins . as a result",
    ", we obtain estimates of transition temperatures that have a noticeably higher precision than those obtained using local updates @xcite or standard canonical methods @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to check that our method did not produce systematic errors , we performed several simulations of the two - dimensional seven- and ten - state potts models with nearest - neighbor interactions and sizes up to @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain dynamical exponents close to the ideal random - walk value @xmath22 . although computed from rather modest statistics , our estimate of the interfacial free energy for the largest size reaches a precision of four digits . in this respect ,",
    "our method compares perfectly well with other methods operating in the multicanonical ensemble , and represents an alternative way for short - range spin models .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] , after briefly reviewing some prominent features of multicanonical methods , we explain how we combine a multicanonical weighting with collective updates , with special emphasis given to the detailed balance equation .",
    "section  [ sec : lr_optimization ] addresses optimizations dedicated to long - range models . numerical results regarding the dynamic characteristics of our method",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_dyn_behaviour ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nn_model ] , we compare our results for the two - dimensional potts model with nearest - neighbor interactions , with exactly known results , and section  [ sec : lr_model ] is devoted to the investigation of the precision of our method in the context of the long - range potts chain with power - law decaying interactions .",
    "overall , we pay particular attention to comparison with other algorithms operating in the multicanonical ensemble , especially in terms of tunneling rates , dynamical exponents and estimates of thermodynamical averages .",
    "finally , we discuss several procedures aimed at estimating the microcanonical temperature , and in particular , how we can efficiently combine our method with the transition matrix approach .",
    "monte carlo simulations are based on the generation of a markov chain of configurations @xmath23 , where each configuration is assigned a weight @xmath24 $ ] corresponding to the probability distribution one wishes to sample . in canonical simulations ,",
    "i.e. , carried out at a fixed inverse temperature @xmath25 , one chooses a boltzman weight @xmath24 = e^{-\\beta e(\\sigma_i)}$ ] , thus thermodynamical averages are straightforwardly obtained by computing the appropriate moments of the data accumulated at the given temperature . on the other hand , reweighting methods based on multihistogramming @xcite are hampered at large lattice sizes by the narrowness of the energy window that is sampled , let alone additional supercritical slowing down . in the multicanonical ensemble , one allows the dynamics to jump across free energy barriers and , from a more general standpoint , to sample wide energy windows , by producing a flat energy distribution over the energy range of interest for the problem at hand .",
    "this is formally carried out by setting @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the density of states and @xmath28 is the microcanonical entropy .",
    "this in effect leads to @xmath29 for the number of visits to energy @xmath30 .",
    "since the density of states is obviously a priori unknown , @xmath3 is estimated using an iterative procedure initially fed from , e.g. , a canonical guess @xmath31 at a carefully chosen inverse temperature @xmath32 , a flat guess @xmath33 , or  whenever feasible  a properly scaled estimate obtained at a smaller lattice size .",
    "thermodynamic quantities that depend solely on the energy , like the specific heat or binder cumulants , can then be computed directly from the estimated density of states .",
    "other quantities , e.g. , those depending on the order parameter , are obtained through a reweighting procedure based on data gathered during an additional production run .",
    "historically , berg s recursion scheme @xcite was the first iteration procedure specifically dedicated to multicanonical simulations .",
    "it consists in accumulating histogram entries of the energy during each iteration run , and updating @xmath3 from the histogram of the energy obtained in a previous iteration run , until eventually the histogram becomes flat up to a given tolerance .",
    "entropic sampling @xcite more or less boils down to the same key principle .",
    "both methods suffer , however , from poor scalability .",
    "looking at this issue from a slightly different angle , the recently proposed wang - landau acceleration method @xcite updates @xmath3 in real - time during the course of the simulation , performing independent random walks in distinct energy ranges . since modifying the weight of the markov chain during a",
    "simulation breaks detailed balance , the amount by which @xmath3 is modified during a given iteration is decreased from one iteration to the other until it reaches a negligible value ; hence detailed balance is approximately restored in the last step of the iteration scheme . in this respect , an original approach aimed at reducing the statistical error in the density of states",
    "was recently proposed by yan and de pablo @xcite , whereby the density of states is obtained by integrating an instantaneous temperature computed from configurational information or from a so - called multimicrocanonical ensemble .",
    "finally , a large class of iteration schemes have been proposed that are based on matrices of transition probabilities @xcite or a combination thereof with wang - landau s algorithm @xcite . here",
    ", the density of states is computed through a so - called broad histogram equation involving infinite temperature transition matrices , where transition matrices keep track of the microcanonical average of the number of potential moves from one energy levels to another ( sec .",
    "[ sec : estimating_betae ] gives more details on how our method can efficiently capitalize on transition matrices ) .",
    "historically , procedures based on transition matrices were termed _",
    "flat histogram methods _ in order to distinguish them from berg s multicanonical method , although both approaches in effect yield a flat , broad histogram . to sum up , the main benefit of multicanonical methods is twofold : first , a wide energy range is sampled , irrespective of the presence of free energy barriers ; second , the methods yield a direct estimate of the density of states .",
    "a local - update implementation of a multicanonical algorithm may consist in updating a single spin at a time and accepting the attempted move from state @xmath34 to state @xmath35 with a probability given by @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "we now show that the microcanonical temperature @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 is a relevant quantity for the acceptance rate of this process . denoting @xmath39 , we expand the probability @xmath40 for small @xmath41 , and obtain @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "this shows that , for small enough energy changes , the dynamics is equivalent to that of a canonical simulation at an inverse temperature @xmath37 .",
    "our departure point for a collective - update implementation in the multicanonical ensemble is thus to build clusters of spins with the same bond probabilities as would be given by a canonical simulation at inverse temperature @xmath37 .",
    "although our algorithm may be equally well applied to other spin models , e.g. , models incorporating disorder or exhibiting a continuous symmetry , we now consider , for the sake of clarity , a generalized ferromagnetic spin model with a @xmath43 symmetry , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath44 .",
    "here @xmath45 and the @xmath46 variables can take on integer values between @xmath47 and @xmath0 . taking guidance from swendsen - wang s cluster algorithm @xcite , we start from an empty bond set , consider each pair of spins @xmath48 in turn , and activate a bond between them with a bond probability given by @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the current lattice energy and @xmath51 the inverse microcanonical temperature at energy @xmath50",
    ". efficient ways of estimating @xmath37 are considered later on in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimating_betae ] .",
    "then , we identify clusters of connected spins using , e.g. , a multiple - labeling scheme @xcite , draw a new spin value at random for each cluster , and accept the attempted move with an acceptance probability @xmath52 which ensures that detailed balance is satisfied . the derivation of this probability may be carried out in the following way .",
    "first , the total acceptance probability @xmath40 , i.e. , the quantity that enters detailed balance in such a way that @xmath53 , is split into two terms @xmath54 and @xmath52 representing a _ proposed update probability _ and an _ acceptance probability _ for the proposed update , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the choice @xmath55 $ ] satisfies the detailed balance equation .",
    "let us denote @xmath56 the set of active bonds over the complete graph @xmath57 engendered by all possible interactions : the _ proposed update probability _ is given by the probability to construct a given set @xmath56 from an empty bond set , i.e. , @xmath58.\\ ] ] after simplification , we obtain for @xmath59 , @xmath60 whence @xmath61 , \\label{eq : cluster_flip_acceptance_rate}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this expression can be further simplified if we consider long - range models whose coupling constant depends only on the distance between spins , i.e. , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "we have for @xmath52 : @xmath66^{b(l ) } \\right ] , \\label{eq : cluster_flip_acceptance_rate_lr}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 stands for the number of bonds of length @xmath68 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , if one looks at this equation from the standpoint of canonical simulations at inverse temperature @xmath32 , we have @xmath31 ; whence @xmath69 and @xmath70 does no longer depend on @xmath30 . as a result , the acceptance rate @xmath52 is equal to @xmath47 and we are back to the original swendsen - wang algorithm .",
    "it is also crucial to underline that it is the microcanonical temperature , i.e. , the lattice energy in the first place , which entirely governs the construction of clusters ; indeed , for a given lattice configuration at energy @xmath30 , bonds are placed as if the model were simulated at its microcanonical temperature using a swendsen - wang algorithm . as a result ,",
    "cluster bond probabilities change continuously as the lattice configuration walks along the available energy range of the random walk , so that , e.g. , small clusters are built in the upper energy range and conversely large clusters in the lower energy range .",
    "as is apparent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cluster_flip_acceptance_rate ] ) , determining the acceptance rate of a cluster flip demands that we compute the energy of the new ( attempted ) lattice configuration , which for long - range models is an @xmath8 operation .",
    "this is similar to the local - update case , where performing one mc step , i.e. , updating @xmath71 spins subsequently , takes a cpu time proportional to the square of the number of spins , seeing that @xmath71 operations are needed after each single spin update to compute the new partial energy between the updated spin and the rest of the lattice .",
    "recently , krech and luijten proposed an algorithm that is able to compute the energy of a model governed by translation invariant interactions in @xmath11 operations @xcite .",
    "this method leans on the convolution theorem and the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , for which numerous efficient radix - based implementations are available . as a result , updating the lattice configuration _ globally _ rather than a single spin at a time allows us to cut the @xmath8 complexity down to an @xmath72 one . a crucial point to be noted here",
    "is that this reduction is absolutely intractable with single - spin updates , owing to the very reason that the energy would have to be computed anew after each single - spin update ; this requires @xmath73 operations , and an fft algorithm would output no gain at all .",
    "let us assume that we can write down the model hamiltonian as a sum of dot products , i.e. , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 invariant by translation .",
    "this is straightforwardly done when @xmath76 , since in this case the dot product reduces to a product of scalar ising spins . as we will witness in a moment , the presence of a delta kronecker symbol in the hamiltonian whenever @xmath77 requires , however , a minor transformation of the hamiltonian . for simplicity , we consider hereafter a one - dimensional lattice with an interaction @xmath78 depending on the distance @xmath68 between spins .",
    "the line argument is similar in higher dimensions , with the sole exception that multidimensional fourier transforms are then performed .",
    "the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the spin sequence @xmath79 reads @xmath80 and reciprocally , @xmath81 similarly , we define the dft of the sequence of coupling constants @xmath82 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 incorporates the effect of infinite image periodic boundary conditions @xcite , that is , @xmath85 ; for algebraically decaying interactions , this sum can be exactly expressed in terms of hurwitz functions @xcite .",
    "we diagonalize the original hamiltonian @xmath86 by rewriting it in terms of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 where it should be emphasized that @xmath90 and @xmath88 are complex conjugates , since the original vectors @xmath91 have real coordinates . by relying on an fft radix-2 algorithm ,",
    "the task of computing the lattice energy is consequently reduced to @xmath92 operations .    for @xmath77",
    ", the kronecker delta symbol in the hamiltonian unfortunately rules out the previous diagonalization .",
    "one way to resolve this issue is to map the @xmath0-state potts model onto a @xmath93dimensional vector model , so that the kronecker delta function in the original hamiltonian is turned into a dot product .",
    "we define a one - to - one mapping between each potts spin @xmath94 and a unit - length vector @xmath95 belonging to a @xmath96-dimensional hypersphere , so that @xmath97 .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that @xmath98 , and that @xmath99 in the case of the three - state model , this transformation is equivalent to mapping potts variables onto the complex plane , i.e. , @xmath100 , and writing the dot product @xmath101 as @xmath102 . in this case",
    ", the term @xmath103 becomes @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the dft of the sequence of ( complex ) variables @xmath106 .",
    "this reduces by one the number of @xmath107 operations required , since computing a dot product is no longer required .    for @xmath108",
    ", spin vectors on the @xmath93dimensional hypersphere may be determined by using hyperspherical coordinates in @xmath109 dimensions , i.e. , for the @xmath110th vector @xmath111 ( with @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 we initially set @xmath114 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "there remains @xmath120 angles @xmath121 to be determined from @xmath120 equations @xmath122 with @xmath123 , from where we obtain @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and thus by induction @xmath126 . after a bit of algebra , we find @xmath127 , and @xmath128 for @xmath129 , where the @xmath130th coordinate reads @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 differ only in the sign of their first coordinate @xmath134 . once these vectors have been computed for a given @xmath0 , which may be done on start - up , determining the lattice energy requires , first computing the dft @xmath135 of each sequence of coordinates @xmath136 , and then evaluating the double sum @xmath137 . as a result",
    ", the whole operation is associated with a @xmath138 complexity  or in general @xmath139 ",
    ", provided the implementation relies on a fft radix algorithm . as a by - product , it should be noted that once the fourier components have been computed , it is straightforward to derive the fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation functions at any inverse temperature @xmath25 from @xmath140 , where the mean value is obtained from a reweighting procedure . at large lattice sizes ,",
    "the requirement that @xmath141 fourier components be stored at each mcs may constitute a significant challenge in terms of computer memory ; in this case , a practical work - around consists in computing microcanonical averages for each energy level visited during the simulation , and then to perform the reweighting procedure directly from these microcanonical averages . in the case of long - range interactions ,",
    "careful attention must be paid , however , to the influence of the discretization of the energy axis in terms of systematic error .      for long - range spin models , building a new cluster at each mcs",
    "takes of order @xmath142 operations , since @xmath143 pairs of spin are considered in turn for bond activation . when interactions decay with distance , the probability of adding a bond between two spins falls off quite rapidly as the distance between them increases .",
    "a significant amount of time during the construction of the cluster is thus wasted because an overwhelming number of bonds are considered for activation which have only a negligible probability to be activated . even in the case of interactions decaying as @xmath144 with @xmath145 close to @xmath146 ,",
    "does the bond count never exceed a few percent of the whole number of available bonds . in this respect , switching from a local- to a global- update scheme might well be an ill - fated choice as the gain in terms of autocorrelation time is spoiled by the exceedingly time consuming construction of the cluster .",
    "however , an efficient construction method was proposed by luijten and blte in the recent past @xcite , with an efficiency that is independent of the number of interactions per spin , and a cpu demand that scales roughly as @xmath71 .",
    "the rationale behind this method is to use cumulative probabilities , whereby instead of considering each spin in turn for addition to a given cluster , it is the index of the next spin to be added which is drawn at random .",
    "we now give a sketchy outline of the method in the context of long - range chains .",
    "extensive details may otherwise be found in @xcite .",
    "first of all , the probability to add a bond is split up into two parts , namely , ( i ) a provisional probability @xmath147 ( hereafter simply denoted @xmath148 ) depending on the distance @xmath149 between spins and on the lattice energy @xmath30 , and ( ii ) a factor @xmath150 controlled by the spin values , e.g. , a kronecker delta symbol in the case of a potts model .",
    "if @xmath146 denotes the index of the current spin to which we are adding bonds ( i.e. , spin indices are considered to be relative to the current spin ) , then the provisional probability of skipping @xmath151 spins and bonding the current spin with a spin at position @xmath152 is given by @xmath153 .",
    "from there , one builds a table of cumulative probabilities @xmath154 for all @xmath155 , so that the index @xmath156 of the spin to be bound with current spin @xmath146 is obtained by first drawing a random number @xmath157 and then reading out @xmath156 from the table , i.e. , @xmath156 is such that @xmath158 .",
    "standard binary - search algorithms may be used for this purpose .",
    "last , a bond is activated between spins @xmath146 and @xmath156 with a probability @xmath159 , and we proceed further with the computation of the index @xmath160 of the next spin to be bound with current spin @xmath146 .",
    "the corresponding provisional probability thus becomes @xmath161 , and the cumulative probabilities read @xmath162 .",
    "the same procedure is repeated for @xmath163 until we draw a @xmath164 , in which case we jump to the next current spin , which in a one - dimensional model is the nearest - neighbor of the previous current spin . in addition , there are two formulas which make it easier to compute cumulative probabilities : first , one can show that @xmath165 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the energy of the current configuration , and second , the cumulative probabilities @xmath166 can be straightforwardly derived from the @xmath167 coefficients through the relation @xmath168 .",
    "it follows from the last relation that , instead of building a look - up table for each @xmath166 , we may as well draw a random number @xmath157 , transform it to @xmath169 + c_0(j_{\\alpha})$ ] , and choose the next spin to be added from the relation @xmath170 . in practice",
    ", we thus simply need to compute a single look - up table filled with @xmath171 for each @xmath172 at the beginning of the simulation , from where we will derive the @xmath173 coefficients at each new mcs corresponding to a lattice configuration with a given energy @xmath30 .",
    "this last task requires of order @xmath71 operations . to sum up",
    ", the construction of each cluster thus consists in choosing a `` current '' spin amongst @xmath174 possible spins in turn , e.g. , starting from the leftmost one , and then activating bonds between the current spin and other spins located to its right by drawing a random number , scaling it , and selecting the bond indices from a look - up table containing the @xmath173 coefficients at energy @xmath30 .",
    "once each spin has been considered as a current spin , a cluster multiple labeling technique can eventually be used to identify every set of spins actually belonging to the same cluster @xcite .",
    "in this section , we address the performance of our algorithm in terms of dynamical behavior .",
    "since our work focuses mainly on long - range spin models , we decided to perform intensive numerical tests on the one - dimensional @xmath0-state potts chain with lr interactions @xmath144 decaying as a power law of the distance between spins .",
    "the rich phase diagram of this model , and the fact that several numerical studies have been carried out on this model in the recent past , makes it a perfect test - case . for the sake of comparison with other numerical methods , and in order to ensure that our algorithm did not produce systematic errors , we also performed several tests on the two - dimensional model with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions , for which exact results are known ( see @xcite ; also references in @xcite ) .",
    "both models are known to exhibit a first - order transition for an appropriate set of parameters , namely , @xmath175 for the nn model @xcite , and @xmath176 for the lr one , with for instance @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "we chose a set of parameters that would allow us to observe both weak and strong first - order transitions , and concentrated on several indicators of performance , reliability , and scalability : these include tunneling , equilibrium and effective autocorrelation times , and mean acceptance rates .",
    "these indicators inform us on the efficiency with which the markov chain reaches the equilibrium distribution and explores the phase space .",
    "they also tell us at what rate successive measurements decorrelate from each other ; hence what amount of resources is needed to obtain reliable statistics .",
