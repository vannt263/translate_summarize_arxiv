    "we found that several numerical results can be understood with the help of a simple geometrical optics model .",
    "this model helps to find the optimal position of the scatterer , it explains why the directivity is in general higher for refractive index @xmath161 than for @xmath158 , and also why the emission occurs predominantly in a direction opposite of the position of the point scatterer .",
    "it also suggests future investigation of an elliptical microcavity with a scatterer at one of the foci and refractive index inverse to the eccentricity , as in that case focusing in geometric optics is exact , i.e. the paraxial approximation is not required @xcite .",
    "the green s function method also allows one to associate a directivity with different regions of the complex @xmath123 plane .",
    "this is very useful because it indicates in which regions of the @xmath123 plane one can expect highly directional modes if one perturbs the dielectric disk by the scatterer .",
    "it would be helpful to find a semiclassical explanation for the dependence of the directivity on the wavenumber @xmath36 .",
    "most interesting for applications we also discussed how the system studied can be realized physically by a small but finite sized scatterer .",
