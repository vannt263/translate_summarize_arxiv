    "[ sect : intro ] recently , a new approach based on the theory of finite periodic systems , with explicit calculations of the emitter energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , was proposed to calculate the optical response of periodic structures@xcite .",
    "one of the examples , extensively discussed in these references , has been the high - resolution optical spectra of blue emitting ingan superlatices ( sls ) , widely studied by nakamura et al.@xcite excellent agreement with the experimental results was found assuming sectionally constant periodic potentials at the conduction and valence band edges .",
    "it is well known , however , that due to charge polarization at the superlattice layers interfaces , the potential profiles , in the conduction and valence band edges , become parabolic@xcite , as shown in figure [ figsl ] , where the index @xmath0 , stands for conduction and valence band .    in ref .",
    ", the effects of charge polarization on the transmission probabilities and the resonant band structure of open @xmath1 sls , were studied and one of the results obtained there was that , for energies just above the barrier , the subbands become highly asymmetric . on the other hand , the successful theoretically calculations in refs .   and , for the blue emitting samples , implied precisely transitions between subbands that are close to the barrier edges .",
    "it is then worth asking whether the charge polarization effect has or not any consequence on the theoretical results . to this purpose",
    ", we consider here specifically the parabolic modulation of the conduction and valence band - edges and calculate the optical response for the same sample studied in refs .   and .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we outline the model in the wkb approximation and discuss , briefly , the effects of charge polarization on the eigenfunction symmetries and on the selection rules . in section [ sec : optical responses ]",
    "we calculate the energy eigenvalues structure for the blue emitting sls and the corresponding optical response , and compare with the experimental and the theoretical calculation in the absence of charge polarization .",
    "we end up with some conclusions .",
    "for the calculation of the optical response we use the well known golden rule    @xmath2^*\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\varphi^{c}_{\\mu,\\nu}(z)\\bigr{|}^{2}}{(\\hbar \\omega - e_{\\mu,\\nu}^{c}-e_g+e_{\\mu',\\nu'}^{v}+e_b)^{2}+\\gamma^{2}}.\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        here @xmath3 is the emitted photon frequency , @xmath4 the level broadening energy , @xmath5 the gap energy , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energy eigenvalues in the conduction ( @xmath8 ) and valence ( @xmath9 ) bands , measured from the band - edges ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the subband indices and @xmath12 and @xmath13 the intra - subband energy levels . @xmath14 and @xmath15 the corresponding eigenfunctions and @xmath16 the occupation probability .",
    "@xmath17 is the exciton binding energy .",
    "all these quantities are explicitly and rigorously calculated within the effective mass approximation and the theory of finite periodic systems .",
    "analytic and general formulas were derived and amply discussed in ref . .",
    "for the quasibound sls considered here , with potential profiles as in figure [ figsl ] , corresponding to potential functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in the valley and barrier of the conduction ( l = c ) and valence ( l = v ) bands , respectively , we use eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 21 - 23 ) of ref . , written in the wkb approximation .",
    "this means that quantities like @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 must be replaced by ( to simplify the notation we drop the band index @xmath24 ) @xmath25 @xmath26    @xmath27    and @xmath28\\bigr),\\hspace{0.2in}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 reference points , properly chosen .              since the sl global spatial symmetry does not change because of the local parabolic modulation , it is clear that the eigenfunction parity symmetries , summarized in ref . as @xmath32 remain unchanged",
    "this is apparent in figure [ figefs ] , where some eigenfunctions for the superlattice with parabolic modulation ( left ) are plotted together with the eigenfunctions for the superlattice with sectionally constant ( right ) potential profile .",
    "consequently , the symmetry selection rules , that rely on the eigenfunction symmetries , remain the same as proposed in ref . .",
    "at variance with the eigenfunctions behavior , the energy eigenvalues and the surface states are sensitive to the strength of the charge polarization , represented in our model by the heights ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) and depths ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) of the parabolic modulations .",
    "in general , the conduction band edge modulation pushes up the energy eigenvalues . in some cases",
    "this effect may have no other consequence than a shift of the optical spectra , but in others we can have important changes in the energy - level structure . to gain an insight into this effect , we plot in figure [ figtcs ] the resonant _ hole s _ transmission coefficients , for two values of the parameter @xmath36 . in @xmath37 ) , we considered @xmath383mev while in @xmath39 ) @xmath382mev .",
    "the other parameters were exactly the same for @xmath37 ) and @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is well - known that the resonant bands , of open sls , provide good information on the position of the eigenvalues bands of bounded sls . as mentioned before the optical transitions that account for the observed spectra correspond to those from the first subband in the conduction band , with energies of the order of 0.13ev ( for a barrier height @xmath40 0.24ev ) , to the second subband of the valence band ( vb ) , with barrier height @xmath41 0.12ev , and energy eigenvalues spread out around 0.11ev .",
    "notice that this subband ( the second of the vb ) appears in figure [ figtcs ] just below the barrier edge , while four resonances appear for energies within the parabolic confining potential .",
    "notice also that the subbands in @xmath37 ) are slightly wider than in @xmath39 ) .        since the change in the parameter @xmath42 is small , it is convenient to see the effect on the band structure through the eigenvalues equation @xmath43-\\frac{k_l^2-q_{wl}^2}{2k_lq_{wl}}\\im{\\rm m } [ \\alpha_{nl}e^{ik_la}]\\,\\,\\cr & & - \\frac{k_l^2+q_{wl}^2}{2k_lq_{wl}}\\im{\\rm m}[\\beta_{nl}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the elements ( 1,1 ) and ( 1,2 ) of the sl transfer matrix @xmath46 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 the wave numbers @xmath49    at the wells and cladding layers of the conduction ( l = c ) and valence ( l = v ) b positions ands .",
    "it is clear that plotting @xmath50 we can easily visualize the energy eigenvalues distribution .",
    "it is well known that for bounded superlattice with @xmath51 unit cells , each subband contains @xmath52 energy levels.@xcite two of them correspond to surface states and detach from the remaining @xmath51 - 1 . when the cladding - layer barriers are both of the same height the surface states are practically degenerate . in figure [ figtrs ]",
    "we plot the eigenvalues function in the vb for @xmath383mev , in @xmath37 ) , and for @xmath382mev , in @xmath39 ) . notice that in @xmath39 ) the function @xmath50 , around 0.115ev , approaches and touches the energy axes .",
    "this behavior , implies the existence of additional energy levels . in this case",
    "the surface states , that are absent in @xmath37 ) .        in figure [ figcvcs ] , we plot the subbands in the conduction and the valence bands .",
    "the subband for @xmath11=2 , in the vb , is slightly amplified to visualize the effect .",
    "besides the subbands with and without surface - energy levels , we see also the new energy levels in the confining and shallow parabolas at the barrier edge , both in [ figcvcs]@xmath37 ) and [ figcvcs]@xmath39 ) .    in the next section",
    "we will see the consequences of the presence or absence of the surface states on the optical spectra .",
    "we shall now present the charge polarization effect on the optical spectra of the blue emitting @xmath53 superlattice bounded by @xmath54 layers , for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the photoluminescence spectra shown in the lower panels of figures [ figpls]@xmath37 ) and [ figpls]@xmath39 ) were calculated using the golden rule in eq .",
    "( [ susceptpl ] ) .",
    "the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions were obtained from the theory of finite periodic systems in ref . and the symmetries and ensuing selection rules from refs . and .",
    "the optical responses were calculated for the two values of @xmath42 discussed in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the spectrum in [ figpls]@xmath37 ) is for @xmath383mev and the spectrum in [ figpls]@xmath39 ) for @xmath382mev . in the upper part of these figures",
    "we show also the experimental result in refs . and .",
    "it is clear from this figures that a better agreement is found when @xmath382mev . for slightly larger value of the parameter @xmath36 , that corresponds to a stronger charge polarization strength",
    ", we miss the surface energy levels responsible for the optical transitions at @xmath58417.7 nm . as explained amply in refs . and ,",
    "the resonances in the lower panel of [ figpls]@xmath37 ) appear in two groups because of the detachment of the surface states , as indicated with arrows in [ figcvcs]@xmath37 ) .",
    "the transition from the surface state in the cb to the surface state in the vb appears in [ figpls]@xmath39 ) as an isolated peak .    to plot the pl spectra in figure [ figpls ] we considered fixed values for @xmath5 and @xmath17 , such that @xmath59= 2.716ev ; the unit - cell length @xmath60= 7.3 nm and @xmath4=0.00025ev .",
    "the predicted peak separations are of the order of 0.15mev equivalent to @xmath610.2 nm in full agreement with the experimental results .",
    "this separation corresponds with the intrasubband energy eigenvalues separation , as was glimpsed in ref .",
    ", after showing that the observed peak separations can  not ( be attributed ) to simple fabry - perot modes \" , see page 268 of ref . .",
    "the experimental measurements were obtained with a resolution of 0.016 nm .    to conclude this letter , it is worth stressing that the charge polarization corrections discussed here may , in some cases , be necessary to perform in order to account for particular optical spectra features .",
    "our calculations confirm also the relevance of the new theoretical approach to study the optical response of periodic structures . the high accuracy of the theoretical model makes it a powerful and simple approach to design laser devices for different purposes , including laser devices of interest in health applications .",
    "we have shown here that the parabolic modulation of the valley and barrier band edges , in the conduction and valence bands , have no effect on the eigenfunction symmetries and the selection rules .",
    "we have shown with explicit calculations for the blue - emitting @xmath53 superlattice bounded by @xmath54 layers , that the charge polarization strength may have effects on the energy - eigenvalues structure close to the barrier edge . a theoretical calculation , as the one presented here , can not only account for the observed high resolution spectra",
    ", it can also provide an insight into the spontaneous charge polarization strength .",
