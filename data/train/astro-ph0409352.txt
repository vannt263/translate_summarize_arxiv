    "h ii galaxies are dwarf emission - line galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation .",
    "they are characterized by strong and narrow emission lines originated in a giant star - forming region which dominate their observable properties at optical wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most are blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "they have very low metallicities , high rates of star formation and a very young stellar content . many are compact and isolated .",
    "one of the reasons why these objects have attracted significant attention is the possibility that they are very young galaxies in the process of formation .",
    "this possibility , however , has been challenged since evidence for an old ( several gyr ) stellar population has been found in numerous bcgs ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "therefore , a model with a single , instantaneous burst of star formation does not seem appropriate to describe these galaxies and a succession of short starbursts separated by quiescent periods seems more likely ( @xcite ) .    even in the case",
    "if hii galaxies are not primeval , little chemical evolution has happened and they provide important information about how galaxies form and evolve , as well as about the process of star formation in low metallicity environments .    the most distant hii galaxy in the catalogue compiled by terlevich et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is at redshift @xmath190.31 , while the vast majority are at @xmath200.1 .",
    "the proximity of these galaxies allows studies of their structure , metal content and stellar population with high sensitivity and precision , difficult to achieve for high redshift star forming galaxies .",
    "still , finding high redshift hii galaxies is of great interest to investigate their abundance patterns and stellar properties at earlier epochs , compare them with the nearby counterparts and obtain further information about the formation and evolution of galaxies using objects that have undergone little chemical evolution .",
    "the lynx arc is a star forming object at z@xmath213.36 .",
    "it was discovered during spectroscopic follow - up of the cluster rxj 0848 + 4456 ( z=0.57 ) from the @xmath22 deep cluster survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the arc shows a very red r - k color and very strong optical and uv ( rest frame ) narrow emission lines . from the analysis of hst wfpc2 images and",
    "keck optical and near infrared spectroscopy , fosbury et al .",
    "( 2003 , fosb03 hereafter ) concluded that the arc is an hii galaxy magnified by a factor of @xmath910 by a complex intervening cluster environment .",
    "the authors concluded that the continuum is mostly nebular .    by means of photoionization modeling",
    ", @xcite showed that the spectroscopic properties of the lynx arc are all consistent with a simple hii region model of a cluster of @xmath910@xmath23 massive stars , characterized by a very high t@xmath2480 000 k , a high ionizing parameter ( u@xmath90.1 ) and low nebular metallicity z@xmath9 5% z@xmath11 .",
    "indirect arguments suggest that the ionizing stellar population could have much lower abundances . using simple photoionizaton models ,",
    "the authors conclude that the spectroscopic properties of the lynx arc are consistent with those of a metal - poor nebula ionized by a cluster of primordial ( i.e. metal - free ) stars . in this scenario ,",
    "the overabundance of si implied by the models is explained as due to enrichment by past pair - instability supernovae , requiring stars more massive than 120 m@xmath11 .",
    "we investigate in this paper the possibility that normal ( i.e. non primordial ) stars are responsible for the excitation of the gas in the lynx arc .",
    "our first goal is to constrain the physical properties of the gas : electron temperature , density , metallicity .",
    "we will first use standard spectroscopic techniques of nebular analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these results will be compared with those from detailed photoionization modeling and those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the second goal is to characterize the ionizing stellar population : age , metallicity , stellar mass of the burst , possible presence of wr stars .",
    "this will be achieved by means of detailed photoionization models , whose objective is to find an ionizing stellar population able to explain all the spectroscopic properties of the lynx arc ( line ratios , equivalent widths , intensity of the continuum ) .",
    "in addition , such models set tight constrains on the nebular properties , which must be consistent with the results from the standard techniques mentioned above .",
    "we present in  2 the results of the nebular analysis and the photoionization models .",
    "these results will be discussed in  3 .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "in this section we will set constrains on the electron temperature , density and the nebular abundances of the ionized gas in the lynx arc .",
    "all the analysis and discussion presented below are based on spectra obtained with different slit widths and orientations ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the data set and reduction techniques ) .",
    "for this reason , @xcite estimated carefully scaling factors that were applied in order to derive a consistent calibration .",
    "we will therefore assume that the errors introduced by calibration uncertainties are negligible .",
    "the results are also dependent on whether reddening is present or not .",
    "we have ignored this effect .",
    "the very strong uv lines and the lack of evidence for dust reddening from the photoionization models and the fit to the continuum shape ( @xcite ) makes as confident that such assumption is reasonable and our results are not seriously affected by it .",
    "our own work presented in this paper will show that the line ratios are consistent with no dust reddening .",
    "the [ oiii]4363/[oiii]5007 ratio has been traditionally used to measure electron temperatures in ionized nebulae .",
    "unfortunately , the [ oiii]@xmath64363 line is outside the observed spectral range .",
    "we have used the uv [ oiii ] doublet instead , since the [ oiii]@xmath51661,1666/[oiii]@xmath65007 ratio is mostly sensitive to electron temperature .",
    "we show in fig.1 the dependence of the [ oiii]@xmath51661,1666/[oiii]@xmath65007 ratio with electron temperature the position of the lynx arc ( the value of the ratio is 0.074@xmath100.005 , see table 1 ) is also shown as a filled circle .",
    "it implies @xmath2517300@xmath8 k. this value is somewhat higher than that predicted by the photoionization models presented in @xmath262.2 which give @xmath2716200@xmath10500 k , although taking errors into account , the discrepancy is not important .",
    "this further supports that dust reddening effects are negligible , otherwise , the temperature derived from fig .",
    "1 would be a lower limit and large discrepancies with the photoionization model predictions would arise .",
    "this temperature is much lower than that derived by @xcite and @xcite by means of photoionization modeling ( @xmath920000 k ) .",
    "the discrepancy is due to a combination of the very hard ionizing continuum ( very energetic electrons are therefore released in the ionization processes ) and high @xmath28 ( ionization parameter ) value used by these authors .",
    "there are three uv line doublets we can use to estimate the electron density in the lynx arc : ciii]@xmath51907,1909 , siiii]@xmath51883,1892 and niv@xmath51483,1487 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the results shown in table 1 correspond to t@xmath2910000 - 20000 k range , where the ratios are quite insensitive to temperature .",
    "the upper limits take the errors into account ( i.e. the densities shown correspond to the minimum possible value of the line ratio ) .",
    "the siiii ] doublet density determination has to be considered carefully .",
    "we have noticed that the predictions by keenan , feibleman & berrington ( 1992 , see fig.2 ) are actually inconsistent with the results of our photoionization models (  2.3 ) . as an example , for some of the @xmath30=1000 @xmath3 models presented in  2.3 , siiii]1883/1892=1.8 , which is above the maximum possible value ( @xmath91.5 ) predicted by those authors for this ratio . for models with @xmath30=10 @xmath3 , we find that the ratio reaches a value of 2 in some cases .",
    "we also find that the ratio varies for a fixed density ( between 1.45 and 1.8 for @xmath30=1000 @xmath3 ) , depending on other parameters such as the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) properties .",
    ".electron densities measured for the lynx arc using the ciii ] , siiii ] and niv ] uv doublets . [ cols= \" < , < ,",
    "< , < , < , < \" , ]     we have then calculated the stellar continuum at @xmath91600   ( rest frame ) emitted by these instantaneous bursts and compared it with the continuum level measured for the lynx arc which is @xmath90.15 @xmath31jy ( observed frame value corrected for magnification , @xcite ) . this corresponds to f@xmath32=7.89@xmath110@xmath33 erg s@xmath34 @xmath35 hz@xmath34 ( rest frame ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 7 .",
    "the theoretical values are a factor of @xmath910 higher than the value measured for the lynx arc .",
    "the discrepancy is even higher if we take the nebular continuum into account , which according to @xcite is the dominant continuum component .",
    "as @xcite , we therefore conclude that the stellar burst that reproduces the measured h@xmath18 luminosity would produce an observable continuum much ( @xmath910 times ) brighter than that detected from the lynx arc . adding the nebular contribution",
    ", the continuum should be even brighter .",
    "the conclusion is not affected by uncertainties on the magnification factor @xmath31 if the continuum and the h@xmath18 flux scale in the same way with @xmath31 .",
    "a similar problem was reported by @xcite regarding the giant ly@xmath36 nebulae associated with lyman break galaxies .",
    "the authors found that the measured uv continuum is not enough to explain the high ly@xmath36 luminosities of the nebulae .",
    "we now discuss some possible reasons for this discrepancy in the lynx arc .",
    "_ the agn scenario _",
    "the previous discussion suggests that the ionizing source in the lynx arc is hidden from the observers view .",
    "such a geometry is characteristic of type ii active galaxies ( agn ) .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that the lyman `` blobs '' found by @xcite might be powered by a hidden agn .",
    "@xcite suggested the possibility that the lynx arc is a type ii active galaxy .",
    "we , however , strongly support that this is a star forming object for several reasons :    * an unusual ( filtered ) ionizing continuum shape is required to explain the line ratios of the arc ( binette et al .",
    "2003 ) within the agn scenario .",
    "our new models using normal ( i.e. non primordial ) stars show an excellent agreement with the lynx arc measured line ratios , better than the filtered agn models ( see for instance , [ oiii]@xmath65007/hb , nv / hb , civ / h@xmath18 , ciii]/h@xmath18 in table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "i.e. there is no need for an exotic agn model to reproduce the line ratios .",
    "* the very narrow lines of the lynx arc ( fwhm of non resonant lines @xmath4100 km s@xmath34 , @xcite ) are typical of star forming objects .",
    "agns usually show line widths of few hundred km s@xmath34 .",
    "although there are examples of extended emission line regions in active galaxies with narrower lines , these cases are exceptional . * the strongest discrepancies of the filtered agn model disappear with our new models : these are the severe underprediction of the siiii ] lines and the too high electron temperature ( @xmath920 000 k ) predicted by the filtered agn models .",
    "we therefore reject the possibility that the lynx arc is an active galaxy .    _ a hidden starburst _",
    "hidden starbursts have been proposed to explain the spectroscopic properties of the metal poor blue compact galaxy hs 0837 + 4717 ( pustilnik et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this object ,",
    "the extinction of the narrow emission lines from the giant hii region is low , but the large balmer decrement ( @xmath919@xmath104 ) of the broad components suggests that part of the current starburst is highly obscured by dust .",
    "a highly obscured starburst has also been revealed by mid - ir observations of the very low metallicity galaxy sbs 0335 - 052 ( @xmath37=1/41 @xmath38@xcite ) .",
    "roughly 3/4 of the star formation in this object occurs within the obscured cluster .",
    "it is not clear however , that this scenario solves the the lynx arc problem . in hs 0837 + 4717 and",
    "sbs 0335 - 052 the non - obscured regions emit both strong continuum and emission lines .",
    "i.e. , if optical emission lines are detected , the ionizing stars are also detected .",
    "this is not the case for the lynx arc .",
    "_ differential gravitational lensing amplification",
    "_    the different spatial distribution between ionized gas and young stars can be the solution to the lynx continuum problem .",
    "the discrepancy between reddening values derived using the uv continuum and the ratios of the balmer lines found in some star forming galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) has been explained as due to ionized gas and stars having different spatial distributions and suffering different extinction by dust .",
    "when this discrepancy is found , the uv continuum seems to be less affected by extinction than the emission lines .",
    "the opposite case would apply to the lynx arc .",
    "spatial decoupling between ionized gas and young stars has been observed in some star forming galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and proposed by several authors to explain different issues ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite )    the degree of amplification suffered by the source undergoing lensing depends strongly on both the position close to the critical lines and the geometry of the lensed object , so that separate regions can suffer different degrees of amplification . if stars and gas have different spatial distributions in the lynx arc , emission lines and stellar continuum can suffer different magnification due to the intervening cluster .",
    "differential amplification between lines and continuum has been observed in several quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "detailed gravitational lensing models would be necessary to verify this possibility .    _ a primordial stellar population _",
    "the sed of metal - free stars is characterized by effective temperatures on the main sequence around 10@xmath2 k , hotter than their counterparts of equal mass but finite metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the uv recombination emission lines , such as heii@xmath61640 , would have extreme equivalent widths more than an order of magnitude larger than the expectation for a normal cluster of hot stars with the same total mass and a salpeter imf .",
    "bromm , kudritzki & loeb ( 2001 ) estimated that a cluster of 10@xmath23 m@xmath11 of popiii stars with a heavy imf would produce @xmath92.3@xmath110@xmath39 erg s@xmath34 in the heii@xmath61640 line and a spectral luminosity per unit frequency of 1.8@xmath110@xmath40 erg s@xmath34 hz@xmath34 . for the observed luminosity of the heii@xmath61640 in the lynx arc ( @xmath94.4@xmath110@xmath39 erg s@xmath34 ) a cluster of @xmath92@xmath110@xmath23 m@xmath11 of primordial stars",
    "would be required .",
    "such a cluster would produce a spectral flux per unit frequency of 3.1@xmath110@xmath33 erg s@xmath34 @xmath35 hz@xmath34 at the distance of the lynx arc .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath92.3 below the continuum measured for the lynx arc .",
    "the discrepancy , therefore , disappears and this result is consistent with the conclusion by @xcite that the continuum is mostly nebular .",
    "the possibility that the lynx arc is a popiii object was proposed and discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to explain , however , nebular abundances as high as @xmath910% if the stellar population is primordial .",
    "we have characterized the physical properties ( electron temperature , density , chemical abundances ) of the ionized gas and the ionizing stellar population in the lynx arc , a gravitationally amplified hii galaxy at @xmath41=3.36 .",
    "the temperature sensitive ratio [ oiii]@xmath51661,1666/@xmath65007 implies an electron temperature @xmath7=17300@xmath8 k , in good agreement within the errors with photoionization model predictions .",
    "the uv doublets imply the existence of a density gradient in this object , with a highly ionized high density region ( 0.1 - 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 ) and a low density region ( @xmath43200 @xmath3 ) with lower ionization state .",
    "both the photoionization modeling and standard techniques of chemical abundance determination imply that the gas metallicity is @xmath910@xmath103% z@xmath11 .",
    "both methods suggest that nitrogen is overabundant with n / o@xmath92.0 - 3@xmath1[n / o]@xmath11 , unless a density gradient produces this apparent effect .",
    "we do not find evidence for si overabundance as fosbury et al .",
    "the reason is the different shape of the ionizing continuum assumed by these authors ( 80 000 k black body , much hotter than the dominant ionizing stars in our models ) .",
    "photoionization models imply that the ionizing stars have very young ages @xmath125 myr .",
    "since the emission lines trace the properties of the present burst only , nothing can be said about the possible presence of an underlying old stellar population .",
    "instantaneous burst models with z@xmath14@xmath155% z@xmath11 and ages @xmath92.8 - 3.4 myr ( depending on z@xmath14 ) , are in excellent agreement with the lynx spectrum , including the strong he@xmath16 emission . at this",
    "age wolf rayet stars make an important contribution to the hard ionizing luminosity and they are responsible for the excitation of the he@xmath16 emission . in such case , we infer the existence of @xmath92.5@xmath110@xmath42 wr stars in the lynx arc .",
    "alternative excitation mechanisms for he@xmath16 , however , can not be discarded .",
    "therefore , the lynx arc is a low metallicity hii galaxy that is undergoing a burst of star formation of @xmath125 myr age .",
    "one possible scenario that explains the emission line spectrum of the lynx arc ,",
    "the strength of the nitrogen lines and the strong he@xmath16 emission is that the object has experienced a merger event that has triggered a powerful starburst phase .",
    "wolf rayet stars have been formed and contribute to a fast chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "as fosbury et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we find a factor of @xmath1510 discrepancy between the mass of the instantaneous burst implied by the luminosity of the h@xmath18 line and the mass implied by the continuum level measured for the lynx arc .",
    "we have discussed several possible solutions to this problem .",
    "the most satisfactory explanation is that gas and stars have different spatial distribution so that the emission lines and the stellar continuum suffer different gravitational amplification by the intervening cluster .",
    "detailed gravitional lensing models are needed to test the vailidity of this scenario .",
