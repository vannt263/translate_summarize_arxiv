    "the above results suggest that an improvement of the solution for the spectral strength would require a better description of the excitation spectrum . one important problem of ( d)rpa is the appearance of at most one collective phonon for a given @xmath39 combination while several low - lying isoscalar @xmath34 and @xmath40 excited states are observed at low energy in @xmath0 , as well as additional @xmath37 and @xmath36 states .",

    "the lowest drpa solutions for both the @xmath34 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 channels were shifted down to their relative experimental energies and then they were employed to generate the two - phonon contributions for the erpa calculation .",
    "we note that the solution for the first isoscalar @xmath34 state in drpa is found much higher in energy at @xmath3817  mev and it has a sharp ph character .",
