    "color superconductivity is expected to be the ground state for high baryon chemical potential @xmath0 and low temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is believed that such a state of matter may exist at the core of very dense stars . to find any signature of its existence ,",
    "it is important to study various properties of the color superconducting phase . when all the quarks are massless , there are superconducting phases , namely the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) and the 2sc phases@xcite . in the cfl phase , all quark flavors take part in the condensation , but in the 2sc phase , one quark does not participate in the condensation .",
    "with realistic values of quark masses and charge neutrality conditions , the cfl phase gets modified to phases known as mcfl , dsc @xcite , usc @xcite , gcfl , g2sc @xcite , and fflo phases @xcite etc .",
    "one of the interesting properties of a color superconductor is that it is also a superfluid .",
    "this is because apart from local symmetries , such as @xmath1 of color symmetry and @xmath2 of electromagnetism , certain global symmetries are also spontaneously broken in the superconducting phase .",
    "the global symmetries spontaneously broken in the superconducting phase are @xmath3 ( the flavor symmetry ) and @xmath4 ( the baryon number symmetry ) .",
    "one expects defect solutions such as flux tubes or vortices to be present in the superconductor since it is both a superconductor and a superfluid .",
    "recently there have been lots of studies of superfluid vortices @xcite and flux tubes @xcite in the color flavor locked ( cfl ) phase and in the 2sc phase @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "superfluid vortices are topologically stable .",
    "the flux tubes studied so far are not topological and it is not clear if they are stable at all .",
    "all the topological string solutions like vortices or flux tubes are due to and are related to the existence of nontrivial loops ( nnl s ) in the order parameter space ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "an @xmath5 is the set of all possible values of the order parameter ( @xmath6 ) which is the diquark condensate in this case .",
    "each nnl in the @xmath5 corresponds to nontrivial defect solutions in the superconducting phase .",
    "previous studies have considered nnl s in the @xmath5 which are generated only by the baryon number charge @xcite .",
    "however when symmetry groups such as color , flavor and baryon number are spontaneously broken , one can have other nnl s .",
    "there are nnl s in the @xmath5 which are generated partly by the baryon number and partly by other non - abelian color or flavor generators @xcite .",
    "these loops give rise to non - abelian strings .",
    "these string defects have been studied previously in the context of broken chiral symmetry in the framework of the linear sigma model @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the non - abelian defects in the color superconducting phase .",
    "we include the effects of gauge fields which result in flux tubes .",
    "these flux tubes are unlike those in ordinary superconductors .",
    "the energy per unit length of the string behaves like that of a superfluid vortex .",
    "this is why we call these non - abelian flux tubes as semi - superfluid strings . in this work",
    "we consider the semi - superfluid strings in the cfl phase .",
    "we will argue that these defects and superfluid vortices are possible in the dsc , usc and mcfl phases . in order that the flux tubes are dynamically stable , the color superconductor must be type ii . for asymptotic values of the chemical potential @xmath0 ,",
    "the color superconductor is type i , but for intermediate values of @xmath0 it can be type ii @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the ginzburg - landau free energy and discuss the nontrivial loops in the @xmath5 which give rise to the non - abelian string defects .",
    "section iii will contain numerical results for the configuration of string defects in the cfl phase . in section",
    "iv we discuss a possible scenario for the string network and its evolution at the core of a very dense star . in section iv , we present our conclusions .",
    "in the superconducting phase the dominant pairing channel consists of two quarks of the same helicity . we will denote the corresponding order parameters by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 are @xmath10 matrices transforming by the @xmath11 representation of @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "one can argue that a semi - superfluid string has the same winding number for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in our calculation",
    "we assume that @xmath13 .",
    "the ginzburg - landau(gl ) free energy is a function of @xmath14 . in the weak coupling and in the chiral limit it is given by @xcite@xcite @xmath15",
    "if the static electromagnetic gauge field is @xmath16 and the static color gauge fields are @xmath17 , @xmath18 the covariant derivatives and field strengths are @xmath19    now if the field is @xmath20 then the corresponding flavor symmetry group is @xmath21 . under the element @xmath22 ,",
    "the diquark condensate transforms as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however from eq.([z3 ] ) , we see that the group of elements @xmath27 leaves @xmath14 invariant .",
    "so the symmetry group of the free energy @xmath28 is @xmath29 in the symmetric or qgp phase , the diquark condensate vanishes and so is invariant under the group @xmath30 . on the other hand @xmath14",
    "is non - zero in the superconducting phase . as a result a smaller group ( @xmath31 ) of transformations keeps @xmath14 invariant .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath32 depends on the form of @xmath14 and thereby on the state of the superconducting phase .    in the cfl phase the free energy @xmath28",
    "is minimized when @xmath14 is proportional to a constant unitary matrix @xmath33 .",
    "so one can write for the minimum energy configuration , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 is a positive real number .",
    "for the analysis of the symmetry breaking pattern one can take @xmath37 without loss of generality , where @xmath38 is a @xmath10 identity matrix .",
    "the group @xmath39 keeps @xmath37 invariant .",
    "this set contains all the elements of @xmath40 defined above . in order to find the stability group @xmath41 of @xmath34 we must quotient this set by @xmath40",
    ". hence @xmath42 the symmetry breaking pattern in the transition from normal to cfl phase ( @xmath43 ) therefore is @xmath44 thus the order parameter space @xmath5 for the @xmath14 is given by , @xmath45 / [ su(3 ) \\times z_3 ] = u(3 ) = { su(3 ) \\times u(1 ) \\over z_3}.\\ ] ] the @xmath46 allows nnl s . in the language of homotopy groups ,",
    "the nnl s are classified by the first homotopy group @xmath47 . in this case , @xmath48 we now explain its features .",
    "@xmath49 allows for non - abelian vortices .",
    "we can see this as follows .",
    "a nontrivial closed loop in @xmath49 can be described by a curve in @xmath50 beginning at identity which becomes closed on quotienting by @xmath51 .",
    "consider the curve from @xmath52 to @xmath53 in @xmath50 . in the @xmath54 part , only the end points of this curve matter to determine the homotopy class of this curve . in the @xmath55 part , it is the curve @xmath56 from @xmath38 to @xmath57 in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "the @xmath54 part of this curve is nontrivial . in @xmath49",
    "then , it is a nontrivial non - abelian closed loop @xmath58 .",
    "it is the generator of @xmath59 in eq.([ops ] ) .",
    "if @xmath60 $ ] is the homotopy class of this loop , @xmath60 ^ 3 $ ] is associated with a closed loop in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the closed loop in @xmath54 can be deformed to a point .",
    "hence @xmath60 ^ 3 $ ] is a nnl in @xmath55 and corresponds to the abelian superfluid vortices studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the elementary non - abelian vortices can be associated with @xmath60 $ ] or @xmath60^{-1}$ ] .",
    "any non - abelian vortex is associated with @xmath60[l]^{3k}$ ] or @xmath60 ^ 2[l]^{3k}$ ] for @xmath61 .",
    "now we construct the loops in the @xmath5 .",
    "we consider two loops , one in the homotopy class of @xmath60 $ ] and the other in the homotopy class @xmath62 = [ l]^{-2}$ ] .",
    "the projections of these loops in the @xmath54 part of the @xmath5 are same .",
    "the projections of loops @xmath58 and @xmath63 in @xmath4 go from identity to @xmath64 in the anti - clockwise and clock - wise directions respectively .",
    "the latter explicitly is @xmath65 . in @xmath4",
    "they are generated by the baryon charge , @xmath66 the loops @xmath58 and @xmath63 are parameterized in @xmath4 as @xmath67 where the parameter @xmath68 varies from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "both these loops start from identity and end at @xmath71 in @xmath4 .",
    "now let us discuss the projection of the loops @xmath58 and @xmath63 on the individual groups @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "note that the @xmath2 is a subgroup of @xmath3 .",
    "the generator @xmath72 of @xmath2 in the @xmath73 basis is given by @xmath74 which is linear combination of the generators @xmath75 and @xmath76 of @xmath3 .",
    "so a curve generated by @xmath72 lies entirely in @xmath3 . to simplify the matter we work in a basis of generators such that @xmath77 of @xmath78 have the same matrix representation @xmath79 as in ref.@xcite .",
    "a path from @xmath80 to @xmath81 in @xmath82 can be generated by @xmath72 or @xmath83 a linear combination of them .",
    "the projection of this curve on @xmath1 and on @xmath3 can be different .",
    "for example the projection of this curve can go from @xmath38 to @xmath84 in @xmath1 and be just a point in @xmath3 or vice - versa .",
    "topologically there is no difference between these different possibilities .",
    "however dynamically they are different .",
    "when the projection in @xmath1 is from @xmath38 to @xmath84 and just a point in @xmath3 the resulting string configuration will be made of only color fields with @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand if the projection in @xmath3 is from @xmath38 to @xmath84 and is just a point in @xmath1 , the resulting string configuration will be made of only ordinary magnetic field with @xmath86 .",
    "but in cfl there is a mixing between @xmath87 and @xmath88 into the following new gauge fields @xcite , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is massive and @xmath91 is massless .",
    "@xmath92 depends on the couplings as follows : @xmath93 because of the mixing between the gauge fields a path from @xmath80 to @xmath81 in @xmath82 has projection both in @xmath3 and @xmath1 for the minimum energy string configuration . as a result for minimum energy ,",
    "the sum of the ordinary and color magnetic flux should satisfy @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the magnetic flux of the massive gauge field @xmath96 and @xmath97 . note that even though the minimum energy configuration has a flux both of ordinary and color magnetic fields , a configuration with only ordinary magnetic flux can still be stable because of flux conservation .",
    "we mention here that previous studies @xcite have considered the flux tube of the @xmath96 field . this flux tube is analogous to the electroweak string .",
    "unlike our case these solutions correspond to a closed loop in the @xmath54 part of the @xmath5 and are not topologically stable .",
    "their counterparts in the electroweak theory have been extensively studied @xcite for stability .",
    "the results show that when the weak gauge coupling is larger than the abelian gauge coupling the solutions are unstable against expanding of the core of the string .",
    "for the same reason the flux tube @xcite considered previously in cfl will be unstable because the strong coupling constant is an order of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "we expect that in the gcfl phase also there will be semi - superfluid strings since the symmetry breaking pattern and the @xmath5 are same as that of cfl case . in the mcfl phase",
    "we expect that the loops considered in the above discussion remain non - trivial .",
    "since different components of @xmath14 have different mass in this case the core structure of the defect will be different from the case when quark masses are degenerate and are zero .",
    "the abelian loops @xmath60^{3k}$ ] as well as non - abelian loops @xmath60[l]^{3k}$ ] and @xmath60 ^ 2[l]^{3k}$ ] still remain when quark masses are finite . because of spontaneous breaking of @xmath4 the @xmath5 always contains a @xmath55 .",
    "the effect of non - zero masses only changes part of the @xmath5 which is generated by the nonabelian generators . however",
    "this change does not affect the above non - abelian nns s as long as the nonabelian generator of this loops @xmath83 is not explicitly broken .",
    "so there should be non - abelian strings in the mcfl phase .",
    "the same arguments can be made about the dsc and usc phase . for the 2sc and g2sc cases",
    "the situation is similar to the electroweak case . as the condensate has only one nonvanishing component , the loops generated by @xmath98 and @xmath83 are same and hence will lie in @xmath99 .",
    "so one will not have any stable topological string solution in the 2sc and g2sc phases .",
    "in this section we consider the @xmath58 and @xmath63 in the @xmath5 and derive the action and the field equation for the semi - superfluid strings . as we mentioned above , because of the mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath100 , the nnl s will have projections in both @xmath3 and @xmath1 . in the following , we will denote the generator corresponding to the massive gauge field @xmath90 by @xmath101 . to simplify the notations we denote @xmath72 by @xmath102 in the following .",
    "the loops @xmath58 and @xmath63 are parameterized by    @xmath103    with a constant @xmath36 .",
    "the projection of @xmath104\\}$ ] in @xmath54 goes from @xmath105 to the center element @xmath84 while the projection in @xmath106 goes from @xmath105 to @xmath64 .",
    "the second loop @xmath107\\}$ ] is the same as @xmath108 except the path in @xmath106 is covered with the reversed orientation .",
    "the minimum energy configuration strings are associated with @xmath108 or @xmath109 . to keep the energy contribution from the covariant derivative to its minimum",
    ", only the massive gauge field @xmath101 is excited .",
    "assuming that the string is along the @xmath110-axis and is cylindrically symmetrical around it , the @xmath14 configuration for the string ( corresponding to @xmath108 with @xmath111 , @xmath112 being the polar angle of the position vector on the @xmath113-plane ) is given by @xmath114    to simplify our calculations we assume that @xmath115 .",
    "the string configuration with the lowest energy will have some @xmath116 dependent profile for @xmath117 .",
    "near the core of the string @xmath118 will have values slightly larger than @xmath36 due to coupling with the @xmath119 field and the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "far from the core of the string where @xmath120 , @xmath117 must be equal to @xmath36 but without any nontrivial winding like the @xmath119 field .",
    "the finiteness of the potential energy part of the free energy ( eq.([gl ] ) ) requires that @xmath121 .",
    "the kinetic energy part of the free energy can be minimized by an appropriate choice of the gauge fields @xmath122 .",
    "since the string is cylindrically symmetrical , the phase varies only in the @xmath112 direction in the @xmath123 plane , so only the @xmath124 will be non - zero .",
    "the total static free energy corresponding to the loop @xmath125 \\}$ ] with @xmath126 is given by    @xmath127    the above free energy is minimized if , at a large distance @xmath116 from the string , @xmath124 is a pure gauge field .",
    "this implies the following form for the gauge field @xmath124 : @xmath128 now the covariant derivative in the @xmath112 direction is given by @xmath129    the gradient energy density from the variation of the fields along the @xmath112 direction is given by @xmath130\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is minimized by @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "so the gauge field @xmath124 takes the form @xmath133    it is important to note that the gauge field reduces the gradient energy by @xmath134 for the string configuration corresponding to loop @xmath135 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath14 and the gauge field @xmath101 respectively are @xmath136    the static equations satisfied by @xmath137 and @xmath138 are @xmath139    now let us consider the string solution for the loop given by @xmath140 .",
    "the ansatz for the @xmath14 field in this case is @xmath141    as in the previous case of the string solution corresponding to the loop @xmath142 , we assume that @xmath143 to simplify our calculations .",
    "the free energy with @xmath144 is given by    @xmath145    again since the phase of the condensate depends only on @xmath112 , only @xmath124 is non - zero . to find out the asymptotic form of @xmath124",
    ", we impose the condition that it asymptotically becomes a pure gauge field and also minimizes the gradient energy .",
    "the covariant derivative of @xmath14 is    @xmath146    the gradient energy density corresponding to the phase variation of @xmath14 is now given by    @xmath147\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is again minimized by @xmath148 .",
    "the reduction in the gradient energy due to the gauge fields is now only by a factor of @xmath149 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the fields @xmath119 and @xmath122 are    @xmath150    which simplifies to the following : @xmath151    we solve equations ( [ diff1])-([diff2 ] ) and ( [ diff3])-([diff4 ] ) numerically to find out the string profile for the two loops @xmath58 and @xmath63 respectively . we choose the values of parameters which will correspond to a type ii color superconductor . for our calculations we took @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155mev .",
    "the parameter @xmath156 is obtained from the relation @xmath157 mev@xmath158 .",
    "we also use the following relations @xcite : @xmath159 for these parameters we have the higgs mass @xmath160mev and the meissner mass ( inverse of the penetration depth ) @xmath161mev .",
    "the results of our numerical solutions are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "though the figures look similar , the energy of the configurations are very different .",
    "one can see that both the @xmath119 and @xmath101 profiles vary more slowly and reach their asymptotic values at larger @xmath116 for the string corresponding to the nnl @xmath162 .",
    "the nnl @xmath63 in the @xmath5 travels a longer path in @xmath4 which costs larger gradient energy for the semi - superfluid solutions as @xmath4 is a global symmetry group .     and @xmath163 profiles for the string corresponding to the non - trivial loop @xmath58.,width=453 ]    -3 cm   and @xmath163 profile for string corresponding to the non - trivial loop @xmath63,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    in the profiles of the string",
    ", we see that far from the core of the semi - superfluid string , the field is color - flavor locked , i.e. the field is a constant times a @xmath54 matrix . however at the core of the string",
    "the condensate is not locked .",
    "the na string corresponding to the loop @xmath164 and a winding number one superfluid string are topologically equivalent . for both these string configurations",
    "the energy density is @xmath165 at large @xmath116 .",
    "it is not clear if one of these configuration decays into the other . on the other hand , this na string is also topologically equivalent to three elementary na strings .",
    "however we do not believe that three clearly separated na elementary strings will evolve into the above mentioned na string or the superfluid string .",
    "we expect that elementary superfluid strings of the same winding number repel each other at large separations .",
    "so the total flux of a network of clearly separated strings should be additive .",
    "we address this issue in a future work .",
    "our non - abelian string solutions are the only stable topological string solutions with quantized flux of ordinary as well as color magnetic field .",
    "all other solutions with flux tube are topologically unstable for realistic values of the strong and electromagnetic couplings .",
    "it is interesting to note that when one takes an electron in a closed path around the non - abelian strings , the aharonov - bohm phase is different from @xmath70 .",
    "this will lead to strong scattering of electrons from these strings . in the following we discuss a possible scenario for the formation of string defects inside the core of very dense stars .",
    "semi - superfluid or superfluid defects in the cfl phase can form during the phase transition from qgp to cfl phase .",
    "topological strings can also be induced in the cfl phase from the outer surrounding confining medium when the star starts to spin up .",
    "this is in analogy with creation of vortices in rotating superfluid . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the formation of strings during the qgp - cfl transition inside very dense stars .    a phase transition from the qgp to cfl phase",
    "may be expected inside the core of dense stars while the star is cooling .",
    "topological strings as well as non - topological strings will be formed during this transition .",
    "we assume that this transition is of first order . in this case",
    ", the transition takes place via nucleation of cfl bubbles in the qgp background .",
    "when the temperature inside the star cools below the critical temperature @xmath166 , bubbles of cfl phase nucleate in the qgp background . inside the bubbles , the magnitude of the condensate is uniform and the massive gauge field @xmath101 is zero .",
    "the phase @xmath68 of the condensate is also uniform inside the bubble and varies randomly from one bubble to the other . when the bubbles meet , @xmath68 interpolates between the values of the phase in the two colliding bubbles .",
    "there are two possible ways @xmath68 can interpolate in the presence of gauge fields @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that the interpolation of @xmath68 is such that the total variation of @xmath68 is the lowest @xcite .",
    "when @xmath68 starts to interpolate , the massive gauge field @xmath101 also gets excited to minimize the gradient energy .",
    "when three or more bubbles collide , it sometimes leads to the variation of @xmath68 by an integer multiple of @xmath70 around the loop at the intersection point .",
    "when this happens , a semi - superfluid string is formed .",
    "this is the conventional mechanism of defect formation known as the kibble mechanism @xcite .",
    "however there are other mechanisms which also contribute to the defect density @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the presence of strong external magnetic fields will affect the formation of semi - superfluid strings .",
    "however since the unbroken gauge field in the cfl phase consists @xmath167 of the electromagnetic field , the major part of the external magnetic field will propagate unscreened @xcite .",
    "only a very small fraction of the external magnetic field , basically related to the massive gauge field , will be repelled by the cfl phase .",
    "so in a sense the formation of semi - superfluid strings is more like the formation of flux tubes in ordinary superconductors under a small external field .",
    "note that the massive gauge field is made up mostly of the color gauge field , so our flux tube will consist mainly of color magnetic flux .",
    "we expect that there is no long range color magnetic field in the medium before the transition takes place .",
    "so the formation of semi - superfluid strings during the transition is spontaneously induced rather than external field - induced .",
    "now we discuss a possible scenario for the network of strings inside the cfl core of the dense star .",
    "usually the temperature at the center of the star is higher and gradually decreases as one moves radially outwards .",
    "so when the star cools , the transition from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to the cfl phase will take place first in a thin spherical shell where the temperature drops below the critical temperature . in this thin spherical region bubbles of cfl nucleate and",
    "grow . as they grow",
    "the bubbles coalesce with other bubbles .",
    "however since the temperature is higher towards the center of the star the bubbles will grow mostly in the spherical region forming a thin spherical shell of cfl .",
    "the picture of the phase distribution is that of a spherical shell of the cfl phase covering the qgp core with temperature above @xmath166 .",
    "the qgp and cfl phases are separated by the qgp - cfl boundary .",
    "the cfl shell and the outer confined crust are separated by the cfl - confining boundary . at this point",
    ", the cooling of the star will be different from that of cooling due to neutrino emission because there will be generation of latent heat when qgp converts into cfl .",
    "further dynamics of the transition can be either by bubble nucleation or motion of the interior wall of the spherical cfl shell covering qgp .",
    "however these two pictures are not much different because even if there is bubble nucleation , the bubbles will nucleate close to the boundary wall as the temperature farther inside is either close to @xmath166 or higher .",
    "so the basic picture of transition is that a cfl shell is formed due to bubble nucleation and then the phase transition takes place through the motion of the interior wall of the cfl shell towards the center of the star .    the strings which can survive such a transition are those which are oriented along the radial direction .",
    "one end of this string will end on the inner qgp - cfl boundary and the other in the cfl - confining boundary .",
    "the strings can end on the cfl - confining boundary because of the availability of color monopole and anti - monopoles pairs in the confined phase @xcite .",
    "the strings with both ends connected to the outer confining crust will decay by shrinking to the crust .",
    "the surviving radially oriented strings will possibly increase in length along the radial direction .",
    "however the density of string ends on the inner cfl - qgp boundary will increase due to the shrinking qgp core .",
    "eventually the density will be so high that ends of different strings will come in contact with each other .",
    "one can argue that the total number of strings ending on the qgp - cfl boundary are even in number with equal number of strings and anti - strings .",
    "two such strings with opposite winding will join together forming huge @xmath168-shaped strings with ends connected to the outer confining crust .",
    "these @xmath168-shaped strings are unstable to moving towards the outer confining crust .",
    "this movement happens almost simultaneously to all string - antistrings pairs ending on the qgp - cfl boundary .",
    "such an evolution of a network of strings may affect the properties of a star like its angular momentum .",
    "we have studied non - abelian semi - superfluid strings in high density qcd .",
    "inclusion of gauge fields reduces the energy of these strings compared with the @xmath4 superfluid string . even with the gauge fields the energy per unit length of the semi - superfluid string is logarithmically divergent with the system size .",
    "still such strings are relevant for finite system like stars .",
    "this is unlike the flux tubes in ordinary superconductors .",
    "the semi - superfluid strings are partly like superfluid strings and partly like flux tubes .",
    "these are the only topological strings possible in high density qcd which have flux of ordinary magnetic and color magnetic fields .",
    "parallel transport of an electron in a closed loop around these strings picks up an aharonov - bohm phase different from @xmath70 leading to their strong scattering from the semi - superfluid string .",
    "we propose a scenario for a string network at the core of the star , the evolution of which can affect the dynamics of the star .",
    "however a detailed study using realistic phase transition dynamics for the qgp - cfl transition and formation of strings is necessary to make any definite prediction for the string network or their possible effects .",
    "we plan to do such calculations in the future .",
