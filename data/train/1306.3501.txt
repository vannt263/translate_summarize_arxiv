    "the field of flavour physics is experiencing rapid experimental progress , e.g.  increasingly precise measurements of the leptonic mixing angles and perspectives to measure currently unknown parameters , such as the leptonic dirac cp phase and the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "this progress provides both a challenge for some of the existing models explaining the flavour structure of the standard model , and an opportunity to constrain and test such models with increasing precision .",
    "for example , the measurement of @xmath5 by t2k  @xcite , double chooz  @xcite , reno  @xcite , and in particular daya bay  @xcite , has put tensions on popular models that predict tribimaximal mixing , and has encouraged the search for new models that are compatible with the experimental values @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently complete particle physics model should also provide a consistent cosmological evolution .",
    "many processes in the early universe happen at high energy scales , which makes these processes very sensitive to particle physics beyond the standard model .",
    "inflation @xcite and baryogenesis are obvious examples .",
    "inflation is driven by the potential of some scalar field , which can be identified with a new field of the particle theory , and baryogenesis is particularly sensitive to the flavour structure and cp violating interactions at high energies .",
    "precision cosmology could therefore provide interesting hints to the high energy particle theory .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed for realising inflation with observable matter fields , e.g.  higgs inflation with non - minimal coupling to gravity @xcite , mssm inflation near inflection points @xcite , and tribrid inflation @xcite .",
    "the inflaton in these models can be an observable gauge non - singlet field , like a higgs field or some d - flat mssm direction .",
    "in such models , the inflationary dynamics and the reheating phase depend on the couplings of these observable matter fields . therefore , they have good prospects for connecting cosmological and particle physics observables , leading to more predictive , testable models .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how tribrid inflation can be realised in flavour models . in the first section ,",
    "we briefly review tribrid inflation and discuss the general procedure how it can be implemented in a given particle physics model .",
    "afterwards , we provide an explicit example model with an @xmath0 family symmetry to demonstrate how this works in practice .",
    "the resulting model is predictive and phenomenologically viable . in particular",
    ", it connects cosmological and particle physics parameters , predicting a relationship between the running of the spectral index @xmath1 and the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath6 or the right - handed neutrino mass @xmath7 . in the last section",
    "we show that the model can automatically avoid the production of potentially dangerous topological defects at the end of inflation , because the waterfall field receives a small shift already during inflation .",
    "we then finish with a summary of our results .",
    "in this section , we discuss tribrid inflation @xcite and how it can be implemented in supersymmetric particle physics models .",
    "we start with a brief review and then describe the requirements and the strategy for realising tribrid inflation in a given model .",
    "we will later apply this general strategy to an explicit @xmath0 model in section  [ sec : a4model ] as an illustrative example .",
    "tribrid inflation is a variant of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite , which uses a superpotential of the schematic form @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we use natural units with @xmath10 to keep the notation simple .    with this superpotential , tribrid inflation is defined as single - field inflation along the @xmath11 direction while @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "inflation ends with a waterfall transition in @xmath12 , which is triggered when @xmath14 .",
    "the singlet field @xmath15 is merely an auxiliary field which is approximately zero during and after inflation .",
    "usually gets a hubble - size mass from the khler potential during inflation . for @xmath16 , the auxiliary field",
    "is then stabilized at @xmath17 . for @xmath18 , @xmath19 along the inflationary trajectory , but as long as it is heavy enough , we still have @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which can be roughly approximated by @xmath13 . @xcite ]    the main difference between tribrid inflation and conventional susy hybrid inflation , which uses the singlet @xmath15 as the inflaton , is that the tribrid inflaton @xmath11 can be charged under symmetries .",
    "we can therefore use matter fields , e.g.  d - flat mssm directions , as inflaton directions .",
    "this connects inflation and particle physics more closely : inflation is most sensitive to the inflaton couplings , so if the inflaton is composed of observable matter fields , then the particle theory can more easily constrain inflationary predictions .",
    "it turns out that depending on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the effective inflaton potential @xmath24 is dominated by different contributions , leading to qualitatively different regimes :    * @xmath25 ( `` loop - driven regime '' ) @xcite : in this case , @xmath24 is usually dominated by one - loop quantum corrections to the effective potential .",
    "the inflaton potential can receive dangerously large supergravity contributions from the khler potential , but these can be avoided either by the use of symmetries in the khler potential @xcite or by a percent - level tuning of one khler potential parameter . * @xmath26 ( `` khler - driven regime '' ) @xcite : in this case , @xmath24 is generated mostly from planck - suppressed operators in the khler potential .",
    ", the loop potential is usually dominant ( loop - driven regime ) , except for some specific khler potentials , where even @xmath27 can be khler - driven . for @xmath28 ,",
    "loop corrections are strongly suppressed , and the khler - driven regime is the generic case . ] for @xmath29 , where the effective field theory ( eft ) is valid , the resulting inflaton potential usually has a hilltop - type shape with only three relevant parameters .",
    "khler - driven inflation can produce an observably large @xmath30 , which  if it should be measured  could fix the most important model parameter , and also rule out the other regimes of tribrid inflation .",
    "* @xmath31 ( `` pseudosmooth regime '' ) @xcite : in this case , @xmath24 is generated from the superpotential coupling @xmath32 , with @xmath33 already during inflation .",
    "inflation proceeds similar to smooth hybrid inflation , but ends with a waterfall .",
    "note that because @xmath33 already during inflation , no topological defects are formed during the waterfall transition .",
    "the predictions have so far been calculated for @xmath34 only , so it is not yet clear whether models with @xmath35 can generate the observed cmb spectrum .",
    "the generic predictions for tribrid inflation within the eft regime are @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the small tensor - to - scalar ratio is typical for small - field models and the mass scale @xmath39 is typical for hybrid inflation .",
    "some of these are falsifiable predictions : an observable @xmath30 would exclude both the loop - driven and the pseudosmooth regimes , and an observable @xmath40 or @xmath41 would exclude all three regimes of tribrid inflation .",
    "in addition to these rough predictions , tribrid inflation provides relations between cmb observables and model parameters .",
    "these detailed predictions depend on the regime .",
    "for example , the khler - driven regime links the running of the spectral index @xmath1 to the superpotential coupling @xmath42 and the symmetry breaking scale @xmath43 .",
    "these relations can connect cosmology and particle physics in explicit models .      in this paper",
    ", we focus on tribrid inflation in the khler - driven regime : @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    for model building purposes",
    ", one should realize that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be d - flat combinations of different fields : @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we can , for example , use some d - flat mssm direction as the inflaton by replacing @xmath52 or @xmath53 .    note that @xmath47 and @xmath54 can be partially composed of different fields , as long as at least one of the fields in @xmath47 and @xmath54 is the same .",

    "the model then predicts a relationship between the running of the spectral index @xmath1 and the neutrino yukawa coupling or the heavy neutrino mass .",
    "interestingly , the production of topological defects during the waterfall transition may be avoided , because the waterfall field can be slightly shifted already during inflation .",

    "the shift in @xmath178 induces a small correction to the inflaton potential from @xmath235 for @xmath236 , the extra inflaton potential that is induced by @xmath237 is therefore much smaller than the inflaton potential @xmath238 .",
    "we conclude that despite the shift in @xmath178 , inflation is mostly khler - driven , except possibly near @xmath226 around which we expect inflation to end anyway .",
    "therefore we can approximately use the predictions for @xmath239 and @xmath240 from fig .",
    "[ fig : l3predict ] , which have been calculated for purely khler - driven tribrid inflation .",
    "a simple variant of this model can be obtained by replacing the vacuum energy term for @xmath178 in the superpotential : @xmath242 the replacement suppresses the shift in @xmath207 during inflation by another power of @xmath243 , which makes it completely negligible .",
    "this improves the quality of our approximations and we expect that the model will behave more exactly like purely khler - driven tribrid inflation , even very close to @xmath226 .",
    "nevertheless , this setup may still remove domain walls during the waterfall transition , as the potential still prefers a specific phase for @xmath207 when @xmath207 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 grow during the waterfall transition .    however , it is not clear whether the preference is sufficiently large to either prevent the production of domain walls or to efficiently remove them if they are produced . to answer this question ,",
    "the preheating phase should be studied in detail , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have seen that if the flavon @xmath178 is identified with the waterfall field and @xmath93 with the inflaton , the waterfall field obtains a small shift during inflation , which can help with preventing domain walls .",
    "however , if we had used @xmath182 or @xmath244 as the waterfall field or @xmath233 as the inflaton , no such shift would have occured during inflation .    in this section ,",
    "we briefly want to sketch which characteristics of the superpotential determine whether the waterfall field obtains a shift during khler - driven tribrid inflation or not .",
    "the main condition can be split in three parts :    1 .",
    "the waterfall field @xmath12 consists of several fields , e.g.  it is a multiplet under some symmetry .",
    "2 .   at least one of the multiplet components of @xmath12 does not receive a mass from the inflaton .",
    "3 .   the same multiplet component of @xmath12",
    "does not receive a mass term from the alignment potential , but is instead stabilized by higher - order terms only .",
    "let us apply these considerations to our example model : the first condition restricts the range of waterfall fields for which this mechanism can work . in our model it is satisfied because we use an @xmath0 triplet flavon as the waterfall field .",
    "the second condition explains why we do not get a shifted waterfall field when we use @xmath233 as the inflaton : the superpotential term @xmath245 provides masses to all three @xmath0 components of @xmath178 as long as @xmath246 , so the waterfall field is stabilized exactly at zero during inflation .",
    "the third condition explains why using @xmath182 or @xmath244 does not lead to shifted waterfall trajectories .",
    "although an @xmath93 inflaton only provides masses to one of the three @xmath0 components of @xmath161 , the other two components acquire mass terms from the flavon alignment potential via the terms @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , during inflation all three @xmath0 directions of the waterfall field are stabilized at zero , and no shift can occur .",
    "we have discussed how khler - driven tribrid inflation can be implemented in realistic particle physics models , using a d - flat combination of charged matter fields as the inflaton and a higgs field as the waterfall field to terminate inflation .",
    "we explained how one can identify suitable inflaton and waterfall fields and which predictions tribrid inflation makes for the model parameters .",
    "our strategy can be easily applied to a wide range of models based on different symmetries , leading to predictive models of inflation in motivated particle physics models .    as an explicit example",
    ", we have analysed a particular flavour model based on a spontaneously broken @xmath0 family symmetry .",
    "the inflaton can be either a right - handed sneutrino or a d - flat @xmath93 direction , and tribrid inflation predicts a relation between the running of the spectral index @xmath1 and either the right - handed neutrino mass @xmath7 or the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath129 .",
    "the model also predicts @xmath249 and a relation between the mixing angles and the leptonic dirac cp phase .",
    "further predictions could be obtained from a detailed study of the reheating phase @xcite .",
    "as the inflaton is composed of mssm fields , its couplings to the visible sector are known ( or could be measured with a collider ) , so one could calculate extra bounds from leptogenesis or from possible overproduction of gravitinos or dark matter .",
    "though such an analysis is beyond the scope of our paper , it is important to realize that by realizing inflation in the visible matter sector , models of tribrid inflation can be very predictive in principle .",
    "we have also shown that in our @xmath0 model , the formation of topological defects at the end of inflation can be avoided automatically , because the waterfall field can have a small shift .",
    "this is related to our choice of the flavon alignment potential .",
    "we expect that such a shift could be generated in models with other discrete family symmetries as well .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation .",
    "we thank vinzenz maurer and constantin sluka for useful discussions .",
    "in this section , we provide plots for the predictions for khler - driven tribrid inflation for different superpotential parameters @xmath22 .",

    "the loop potential dominates , e.g.  if the khler potential contributions vanish due to some symmetry @xcite ; in other cases , the khler potential is dominant and the loop potential can be neglected . in the more general mixed case , however , one should include both contributions to the inflaton potential for calculating the slow - roll predictions .",
