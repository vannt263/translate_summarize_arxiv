    "much recent work has been devoted to understanding continuous limits of random graphs drawn on the two - dimensonal sphere or in the plane , which are called random planar maps .",
    "a fundamental object is the random compact metric space known as the brownian map , which has been proved to be the universal scaling limit of several important classes of random planar maps conditioned to have a large size ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the random ( non - compact ) metric space called the brownian plane , which may be viewed as an infinite - volume version of the brownian map .",
    "the brownian plane was first introduced and studied in @xcite , where it was shown to be the scaling limit in distribution of the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation ( uipq ) in the local gromov - hausdorff sense .",
    "the brownian plane is in fact conjectured to be the universal scaling limit of many discrete random lattices including the uniform infinite planar triangulation ( uipt ) introduced by angel and schramm @xcite and studied then by several authors .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the brownian plane is locally isometric to the brownian map , in the following sense .",
    "recalling that both the brownian map and the brownian plane are equipped with a distinguished point called the root , one can couple these two random metric spaces in such a way that , for every @xmath7 , there exists @xmath8 such that the balls of radius @xmath9 centered at the root in the two spaces are isometric with probability at least @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the brownian plane shares many properties of the brownian map . on the other hand ,",
    "the brownian plane also enjoys the important additional property of invariance under scaling : multiplying the distance by a constant factor @xmath11 does not change the distribution of the brownian plane .",
    "this property suggests that the brownian plane should be more tractable for calculations than the brownian map , for which very few explicit distributions are known .",
    "our purpose is to obtain such explicit distributions for the brownian plane , and in particular to give a detailed probabilistic description of the growth of `` hulls '' centered at the root .    in order to give a more precise presentation of our results ,",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "as in @xcite , we write @xmath12 for the brownian plane , and we let @xmath13 stand for the distinguished point of @xmath14 called the root .",
    "we recall that @xmath14 is equipped with a volume measure , and we write @xmath15 for the volume of a measurable subset of @xmath14 . for every @xmath16",
    ", the closed ball of radius @xmath1 centered at @xmath13 in @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast with the case of euclidean space , the complement of @xmath17 will have infinitely many connected components ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of these components in the slightly different setting of the brownian map ) but only one unbounded connected component .",
    "we then define the hull of radius @xmath1 as the complement of the unbounded component of the complement of @xmath17 , and we denote this hull by @xmath18 .",
    "informally , @xmath18 is obtained by `` filling in the holes '' of @xmath17 - see fig .  1 below , and fig .  3 in section 5 for a discrete version of the hull .",
    "in what follows , we give a complete description of the law of the process @xmath19 . to formulate this description , it is convenient to introduce another process @xmath3 which gives for every @xmath0 the size of the boundary of @xmath18 .",

    "the shaded part represents the hull @xmath22 . at time @xmath23 , both processes @xmath24 and @xmath25 have a jump .",
    "geometrically this corresponds to the creation of a `` bubble '' above height @xmath23.,width=377 ]    in view of this proposition , one interprets @xmath2 as the ( generalized ) length of the boundary of the hull of radius @xmath1 ( this boundary is expected to be a fractal curve of dimension @xmath26 ) . a key intermediate step in the derivation of our main results is to identify the process @xmath3 as a time - reversed continuous - state branching process . for every @xmath27 ,",
    "set @xmath28 .",

    "\\(ii ) the two processes @xmath3 and @xmath42 have the same finite - dimensional marginals .",
    "we observe that results closely related to proposition [ process - exit ] have been obtained by krikun @xcite in the discrete setting of the uipt and the uipq .    part ( ii ) of the preceding proposition",
    "implies that the process @xmath3 has a cdlg modification , with only negative jumps , and from now on we deal with this modification .",

    "the following identity in distribution of random processes holds : @xmath49    this theorem identifies the conditional distribution of the process of hull volumes knowing the process of hull boundary lengths , whose distribution is given by the preceding proposition .",
    "informally , each jump time @xmath1 of @xmath44 corresponds to the creation of a new connected component of the complement of the ball @xmath17 , which is `` swallowed '' by the hull , leading to a negative jump for the boundary of the hull and a positive jump for its volume .",
    "the common distribution of the variables @xmath50 should then be interpreted as the law of the volume of a newly created connected component knowing that the `` length '' of its boundary is equal to @xmath51 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.4 ) for a related result concerning the asymptotic distribution of the volume of a triangulation with a boundary of size tending to infinity ) .",
    "this heuristic discussion is made much more precise in the companion paper @xcite , where many of the results of the present work are interpreted in terms of asymptotics for the so - called `` peeling process '' studied by angel @xcite for the uipt .",

    "should also be applicable to this problem , but our calculations did not lead to a tractable expression .",
    "one may still compare the expected volumes of the hull and the ball .",
    "from the first formula of the theorem , one easily gets that @xmath57=r^4/3 $ ] . on the other hand , using the method of the proof of ( * ? ? ? * proposition 5 ) , one can verify that @xmath58=2r^4/21 $ ] .",
    "we also note that there is an interesting analogy between the second formula of theorem [ laws - hull ] and classical formulas for bessel processes ( see corollary 1.8 and corollary 3.3 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter xi ) ) , which also involve hyperbolic functions  in special cases these formulas can be restated in terms of linear brownian motion via the ray - knight theorems .",
    "the preceding results can also be interpreted in terms of asymptotics for the uipq . in the last section of this article",
    ", we prove that the process of hull volumes of the uipq converges in distribution , modulo a suitable rescaling , to the process @xmath59 .",
    "a similar invariance principle should hold for the uipt and for more general random lattices such as the ones constructed by addario - berry @xcite and stephenson @xcite .",
    "our proofs depend on a new representation of the brownian plane , which is different from the one used in @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", this representation is a continuous analog of the construction of the uipq that was given by chassaing and durhuus in @xcite , whereas @xcite used a continuous version of the construction in @xcite .",
    "similarly as in @xcite , the representation of the brownian plane in the present work uses a random infinite real tree @xmath60 whose vertices are assigned real labels .",
    "the probabilistic structure of the real tree @xmath60 is more complicated than in @xcite , but the labels are now nonnegative and correspond to distances from the root in @xmath14 ( whereas in @xcite labels corresponded in some sense to `` distances from infinity '' ) .",
    "this is of course similar to the well - known schaeffer bijection between rooted quadrangulations and well - labeled trees @xcite .",
    "the fact that labels are distances from the root is important for our purposes , since it allows us to give a simple representation of the hull of radius @xmath1 : the complement of this hull corresponds to the set of all points @xmath61 in @xmath60 such that labels stay greater than @xmath1 along the ( tree ) geodesic from @xmath61 to infinity .",
    "see formula below .",
    "there is a similar interpretation for the boundary of the hull , and a key observation is the fact that the `` boundary length '' @xmath2 can be obtained in terms of exit measures from @xmath62 associated with the `` subtrees '' branching off the spine of the infinite tree @xmath60 at a level greater than the last occurence of label @xmath1 on the spine ( see formula below ) .",
    "the construction of the infinite tree @xmath60 and of the labels assigned to its vertices , as well as the subsequent calculations , make a heavy use of the brownian snake and its properties .",
    "in particular the special markov property of the brownian snake @xcite and its connections with partial differential equations play an important role . because of the close relation between super - brownian motion and the brownian snake , some of the results that follow can be written as statements about super - brownian motion , which may be of independent interest . in particular , corollary [ supercoro ] , which is essentially equivalent to the second formula of theorem [ laws - hull ] , gives the laplace transform of the total integrated mass of a super - brownian motion started from @xmath63 ( for some @xmath64 ) knowing that the minimum of the range is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , corollary [ lawprocess ] determines for a super - brownian motion starting from @xmath65 the law of the process whose value at time @xmath0 is the pair consisting of the exit measure from @xmath66 and the mass of those historical paths that do not hit level @xmath67 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents a number of preliminaries .",
    "in particular , we recall basic facts about the ( one - dimensional ) brownian snake including exit measures and the special markov property , and its connections with super - brownian motion .",
    "we also state a recent result from @xcite giving a decomposition of the brownian snake knowing its minimal spatial position .",
    "the latter result is especially useful in section 3 , where we derive our new representation of the brownian plane . in order to show that this new construction is equivalent to the one in @xcite",
    ", we use the fact that the distribution of the brownian plane is characterized by the invariance under scaling and the above - mentioned property stating that the brownian plane is locally isometric to the brownian map .",
    "section 4 contains the proof of our main results : propositions [ approx - exit ] and [ process - exit ] are proved in subsection [ exit - process ] , theorem [ laws - hull ] is derived in subsection [ volu - hull ] , and theorem [ hull - process - description ] is proved in subsection [ pro - hull ] .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to our invariance principle relating the hull process of the uipq to the process @xmath59 .",
    "an important role in this work will be played by a particular continuous - state branching process , which was already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) and references therein for the general theory of continuous - state branching processes , and content ourselves with a brief exposition of the case of interest in this work .",
    "we fix a constant @xmath68 .",
    "the continuous - state branching process with branching mechanism @xmath69 is the feller markov process @xmath30 with values in @xmath31 , cdlg paths and no negative jumps , whose semigroup is characterized as follows . if @xmath70 stands for the probability measure under which @xmath35 starts from @xmath71 , then , for every @xmath32 and every @xmath33 , @xmath72= e^{-x\\,u_t(\\lambda)}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath73 is determined by the differential equation @xmath74 it follows that @xmath75 , and thus ,",

    "since @xmath82 , we readily obtain that the density of @xmath83 under @xmath70 is ( when @xmath84 ) the function @xmath85    for future purposes , it will be useful to introduce the process @xmath35 conditioned on extinction at a fixed time .",
    "to this end , we write @xmath86 for the transition kernels of @xmath35 .",
