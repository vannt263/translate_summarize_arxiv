    "let us consider the following five words : @xmath82 we want to show that there is no way to assign @xmath83 or @xmath53 to the @xmath84 to obtain distance @xmath1 between these five words .",
    "let us do the following considerations :    1 .   to have @xmath85 and @xmath86 , it must be that @xmath87 . clearly it is not possible that @xmath88 , otherwise @xmath72 .",
    "so , wlog , we have only one of the two following cases : 1 .   either @xmath89 and @xmath90 , 2 .   or @xmath91 .",
    "2 .   to have @xmath92",
    ", it must be that @xmath93 .    consider the case ( 1.a ) .",
    "since @xmath94 and @xmath89 , the only way to have distance at least @xmath1 between @xmath95 ( modulo the permutation of the colums ) is to assign the following values to @xmath96 : @xmath97 in case @xmath98 and : @xmath99 in the case @xmath100 . +",
    "this allows to have @xmath101 , which is the only we can reach in our conditions .",
    "+ now consider @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 has only a zero and @xmath1 ones , and @xmath104 has @xmath105 ones , which are either in the same postitions of the ones in @xmath103 ( this case is impossible because otherwise @xmath106 ) or @xmath107 . since @xmath108 , there remain @xmath1 bits to be filled in @xmath104 , and @xmath109 of this bit must be ones and the other @xmath54 zeros . since @xmath110 , to have @xmath111 , at least @xmath105 of the @xmath1 rightmost bits must differ .",
    "thus we have the following situation in case @xmath98 : @xmath112 and in the following situation in case @xmath100 : @xmath113 now , @xmath114 must be such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "thus in @xmath114 there must be at most @xmath117 zero components , which is a contradiction because , in the case @xmath98 , if : @xmath118 or , in the case @xmath100 , if : @xmath119 then @xmath120 .",
    "+ let us try now with case ( 1.b ) , so that we know @xmath91 .",
    "we also have that @xmath121 , and at the same time @xmath122 can only be @xmath123 , since there are only two zeros components both in @xmath103 and in @xmath104 , and @xmath124 and @xmath102 have the same parity .",
    "since @xmath125 , then @xmath122 must be @xmath126 and the only choice ( modulo permutation of the columns ) for @xmath127 is : @xmath128 where the rightmost component exists only in the case @xmath100 .",
    "+ now consider @xmath129 , which must be such that @xmath130 ( it can not be @xmath1 or @xmath131 , otherwise we would be in a similar case to ( 1.a ) ) , so that it has two zero components which , using a reasoning similar to that for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , to have @xmath132 , must be positioned as follows : @xmath133 now , @xmath134 is such that @xmath135 .",
    "+ @xmath136 or @xmath137 is not possible , otherwise we would have @xmath138 .",
    "+ @xmath139 is not possible in the case @xmath100 , because , having only two zeros the value @xmath140 can be at most 5 .",
    "+ in the case @xmath98 , if @xmath139 , to have @xmath141 the two leftmost component of @xmath142 must be the same as the two leftmost component of @xmath104 and of @xmath143 , which are ones , giving either @xmath144 and @xmath145 , or @xmath146 , which is a contradiction .",
    "+ it remains to prove that @xmath147 . in this case , again , to have @xmath148 the two leftmost component of @xmath142 must be the same as the two leftmost component of @xmath104 and of @xmath143 , which are ones , obtaining actually @xmath149 . in the remaining components of @xmath142",
    "there must be three zeros . if these three zeros are in the same positions where the leftmost ones of @xmath104 are , then @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
