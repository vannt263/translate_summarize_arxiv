    "the number of known extrasolar planets is approaching 100 , and more planets are being discovered every month .",
    "a remarkable empirical correlation has emerged from the aggregate of planets : the parent stars of the detected extrasolar planets appear to be significantly metal - rich in comparison to field fgk dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this correlation was first extensively discussed by gonzalez ( 1997 ) , and has been further studied by a number of authors ; a partial list might include gimenez ( 2000 ) , laughlin ( 2000 ) , santos , israelian & mayor ( 2001 ) , murray & chaboyer ( 2001 ) , and reid ( 2002 ) .",
    "these studies all agree that the fraction of stars containing readily detectable extrasolar planets ( e.g. having @xmath1 m / s , and @xmath2 yr ) increases substantially with increasing stellar metallicity .",
    "a search strategy geared toward the most metal - rich stars should thus detect short - period planets at a far greater rate than a conventional volume - limited survey .",
    "one might argue that a metallicity - based planet search strategy will result in a haphazard accumulation of short - period planets , while simultaneously skewing the overall census of planets in the solar neighborhood .",
    "indeed , it is important to continue with volume - limited surveys in order to round out the unbiased statistical distribution of planetary systems . the discovery of additional short - period planets , however , has important ramifications .",
    "for the following reasons , it is desirable to locate as many short - period planets as possible : ( * 1 * ) the presence of a short - period planet is an excellent indicator that additional planets are present in the system . currently , for example , 5 of 12 short - period planets observed at lick observatory show evidence for additional companions ( fischer et al 2001 ) .",
    "recently , it has been realized that some multiple planet systems such as gj 876 allow for unambiguous determination of planet masses and orbital parameters ( laughlin & chambers 2001 , rivera & lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "( * 2 * ) the current census of short - period extrasolar planets shows an interesting concentration of objects in the period range between roughly 2.98 and 3.52 days ( 8 out of 20 planets with periods @xmath3 d ) .",
    "while this pile - up is probably a consequence of disk - protoplanet tidal migration ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson 1996 ) , the stopping mechanism is not at all well understood .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to find more short - period planets to better delineate the minimum planetary period .",
    "( * 3 * ) geometric arguments indicate that 10% of hot jupiter - type planets transit the face of the parent star .",
    "a large increase in the rate of short - period planet detections thus translates into a significant increase in the number of transits discovered .",
    "transiting planets permit accurate mass and radius determinations , and are extremely important data points within the overall theory of giant planets .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy provides the most precise method for flagging the metal - rich stars which have a high probability of bearing a detectable planet .",
    "unfortunately , the number of field stars with spectroscopically determined metallicities is relatively small .",
    "the most recent compilation from the literature by cayrel de strobel , soubiran , & ralite ( 2001 ; hereafter csr ) contains 6534 metallicity determinations for 3356 stars .",
    "the majority of single , metal - rich , main sequence and subgiant fgk stars in the csr compilation are already under radial velocity survelliance .",
    "a larger pool of high metallicity candidates is needed .",
    "a study by laughlin ( 2000 ) used the hipparcos database ( perryman et al 1997 ) , the hauck - mermilliod ( 1998 ) compilation of uvby photometry , and the schuster & nissen ( 1989 ; hereafter sn ) uvby-[fe / h ] calibration to to identify 200 metal rich stars from a parent population of roughly 10,000 k , g , and late f - type main sequence stars ( having @xmath4 ) in the immediate ( @xmath5 ) solar neighborhood .",
    "nineteen of these stars were added to the keck radial velocity survey in the summer of 2000 .",
    "three of these nineteen stars soon proved to be accompanied by planets ( vogt et al 2001 , butler et al 2002 ) .",
    "metallicity - based search strategies are therefore clearly optimizing the planet - detection efficiency .",
    "the sn calibrations for f and g spectral types were based on 219 calibration stars spanning a range of metallicities from @xmath6 < 0.4 $ ] .",
    "this very useful calibration , which has an overall standard deviation of 0.16 dex per star , is wholly empirical , and has the advantage of using only the standard uvby indices , rather than the differential indices , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , which are used in the earlier calibrations of crawford ( 1975 ) and olsen ( 1984 ) .",
    "the sn calibration has been widely used to investigate metallicity trends among solar neighborhood stars ( e.g. rocha - pinto & maciel ( 1996 ) , or haywood ( 2001 ) . as recently emphasized by twarog , anthony - twarog and tanner ( 2002 )",
    ", however , the sn calibration systematically underestimates @xmath9 $ ] by @xmath10 dex for stars with spectroscopic metallicities @xmath9>0.1 $ ] .",
    "the sn calibration is thus not optimally suited for compiling an accurately ranked catalog of high metallicity stars .",
    "our main goal in this letter is to make the uvby - metallicity calibration more discerning and accurate among the highest metallicity stars .",
    "we also use this forum to briefly introduce the concept of a `` planeticity calibration '' , in which stellar properties are correlated directly with the detectable presence of an extrasolar planet .",
    "to produce our new calibration , we we queried the csr database for all stars which have ( 1 ) hipparcos parallaxes , ( 2 ) uvby measurements in the hauck - mermilliod ( 1998 ) compilations , ( 3 ) @xmath11 , and ( 4 ) lie within 100 pc of the sun ( to reduce the problems posed by reddening ) .",
    "this subset of the csr catalog contains 1533 measurements of 664 stars . using a levenberg - marquardt scheme ( see e.g. press et al 1992 ) , we then optimized the coefficients , @xmath12 , of the most general third - order polynomial in the strmgren indices @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 so as to best reproduce the spectroscopically determined @xmath9 $ ] values .",
    "because the levenberg - marquardt routine provides local convergence , it is prudent to start the iterative sequence with different sets of initial guesses for @xmath16 to better insure that @xmath17 , the set of final coefficients produced by the routine , corresponds to the global minimum .",
    "we ran the levenberg - marquardt procedure using ( 1 ) @xmath16 from the sn `` f star '' calibration ( ignoring the logarithmic terms ) , ( 2 ) @xmath16 from the sn `` g star '' calibration , and ( 3 ) by setting all @xmath16 to unity . in each case , the routine converged to an identical set of final coefficients , suggesting that a global minimum has been achieved .",
    "our calibration is :    @xmath18_{phot } = & -&10.424602 + 31.059003(b - y)+42.184476m_1 + 15.351995c_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&11.239435(b - y)^2 - 29.218135m_1 ^ 2 - 11.457610c_1 ^ 2 - 138.92376(b - y)m_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&52.033290(b - y)c_1 + 11.259341m_1c_1 - 46.087731(b - y)^3 + 26.065099m_1 ^ 3 \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "the csr database has been compiled from a diverse array of metallicity determinations , some of which have reported uncertainties , and some of which do not .",
    "furthermore , many of the 664 stars which survived our cuts for inclusion into the calibration are represented by multiple spectroscopic measurements .",
    "we circumvented the non - uniform property of the csr compilation by assuming that every spectroscopic metallicity measurement has an associated uncertainty of 0.05 dex . with this assumption",
    ", each of the 1533 measurements contributes an equal weight to the calibration .",
    "we compute a reduced @xmath19 statistic of 6.68 for the overall fit , which is superior to the reduced @xmath19 value of 9.33 which results from comparing @xmath9_{phot}$ ] obtained with the sn calibrations with the spectroscopic metallicities .    in figure 2 , we plot the distribution of metallicity differences between the photometric and spectroscopic determinations , @xmath9_{phot}-[{\\rm fe / h}]_{spec}$ ] , for both our calibration and also for the sn calibration .",
    "both distributions are well represented by gaussians .",
    "the new calibration is superior to sn in that it has a narrower half - width at half maximum ( 0.10 dex as opposed to 0.13 dex ) , and is centered more closely to zero ( -0.027 dex as opposed to -0.049 dex ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a similar diagram in which we plot only the results of measurements which yielded a spectroscopic metallicity @xmath9>0.0 $ ] . here",
    "again , our calibration is significantly superior to sn , which is not surprising , as very few high metallicity stars were included in the sn calibration , which was geared primarily toward studies of population ii stars .",
    "our calibration still tends to underestimate the metallicity of the most metal - rich stars in comparison to spectroscopic determinations , but the discrepancy has been significantly reduced . as a specific example ,",
    "the planet - bearing star hd 145675 ( 14 her ) , which is the highest metallicity star in our subset of the csr catalog , with @xmath9=0.5 $ ] ( gonzalez , wallerstein & saar 1999 ) , receives a metallicity estimate of [ fe / h]=0.47 from our calibration , and [ fe / h]=0.13 from sn .",
    "our metallicity calibration should provide a useful sieve for selecting candidate stars to be added to radial velocity surveys . we note here",
    "a handful of class iv and v stars for which ( 1 ) our new calibration finds @xmath9_{phot}>0.3 $ ] , which ( 2 ) do not appear in the laughlin ( 2000 ) catalog , and which ( 3 ) have no previously announced planet : hd 88176 , hd 112164 , hd 15942 , hd 144585 .",
    "in addition to providing spectroscopic metallicities , the csr catalog also lists effective temperature estimates for each of the cited entries .",
    "following the same procedure and applying the same cuts as for our our @xmath9_{phot}$ ] calibration , we have also derived a @xmath20 calibration ,    @xmath21_{phot } = & & 4434.8364 + 29839.391(b - y)-13967.518m_1 - 3041.0698c_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&98624.604(b - y)^2 - 8963.3232m_1 ^ 2 + 10620.269c_1 ^ 2 + 63289.783(b - y)m_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&10099.516(b - y)c_1 + 16204.483m_1c_1 + 91256.827(b - y)^3 - 45093.846m_1 ^ 3 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&10580.081c_1 ^ 3 - 122571.68(b - y)^2m_1 + 16993.421(b - y)^2c_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 111551.98m_1 ^ 2(b - y)-43418.471m_1 ^ 2c_1 - 5856.0002c_1 ^ 2(b - y ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 15492.020c_1 ^ 2m_1 - 127.04874(b - y)m_1c_1 \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we assume that the average measurement uncertainty of the spectroscopic @xmath0 determinations is 50k , the reduced @xmath19 of this calibration is 3.17 , indicating that @xmath22 photometry is quite adequate to providing effective temperature estimates for a given star .",
    "as before , we also construct a distribution of differences @xmath23 , and construct a gaussian fit to the distribution .",
    "the half - width at half maximum for this distribution is 80.4 k , whereas the center lies at -11.5 k.",
    "given the demonstrated connection between the metallicity of a parent star and the detectable presence of a planetary companion , and given the power of the levenberg - marquardt minimization technique in producing empirical calibrations , one can ask a rather provacative question : is it possible to construct a `` planeticity '' calibration in which the chance of finding a readily detectable planet around a given star is estimated directly from uvby photometry ?",
    "cumming , butler and marcy ( 1999 ) , have published a detailed analysis of 11 years of precision radial velocity measurements for 73 nearby stars . within this list of stars ,",
    "there are currently 10 announced planets .",
    "we assign a planeticity @xmath24 to stars with planets , and @xmath25 to stars without .",
    "we then use the levenberg - marquardt method to produce a uvby - planeticity calibration in exact analogy to producing the metallicity and effective temperature calibrations .",

    "we queried the hipparcos catalog for stars lying within 50 pc of the sun , retaining those for which ( 1 ) uvby photometry exists , ( 2 ) fall in the range @xmath27 ( using the stellar evolution models of allende prieto & lambert 1999 ) , and which ( 3 ) were not among the 73 lick survey stars used to build the planeticity calibration given above .",
    "these cuts left 2056 stars , of which 46 have reported planets .",
    "we expect that the majority of the remaining 2010 are currently under radial velocity surveillance , and that relatively few easily detected planets will emerge from this aggregate .",
    "using our calibration , we compute an average planeticity of 0.271 for the 46 known planet - bearing stars , in comparison to an average planeticity of 0.113 for the 2010 stars without reported planets .    we conclude that uvby photometry likely holds little planeticity information beyond that provided by the well - recognized metallicity proxy .",
    "we are very optimistic , however , regarding the possibility of producing a planeticity calibration which is based on spectroscopically determined differential metal abundances within a particular star .",
