    "the collaboration of budker institute of nuclear physics and boreskov institute of catalysis has started the development of aerogel cherenkov counters in 1986 @xcite at novosibirsk .",
    "the most important results of this work are the development of ashiph counters , development of the monte carlo code for simulation of cherenkov light collection , and production of aerogel with high optical parameters .",
    "the idea of the ashiph method is to use light guides with the wavelength shifting admixture for the light collection on pmt @xcite .",
    "as compared with the direct light collection on pmt , the ashiph method allows the number of pmts to be reduced essentially @xcite .    in order to simulate the processes of the light collection and propagation inside",
    "the aerogel cherenkov counter a special code was developed in budker institute of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this code simulates the following processes : rayleigh scattering inside the aerogel , lambert angular distribution of the reflected light from the walls , fresnel refraction on the boundary of two continuous media , and a light absorption inside the aerogel and on the walls . using this code",
    "we optimize the counter design and calculate the number of photoelectrons without production of series of prototypes .",
    "we use the high optical properties aerogel san-96 @xcite produced at novosibirsk by collaboration of boreskov institute of catalysis and budker institute of nuclear physics .",
    "the data on the light absorption ( labs ) and scattering ( lsc ) lengths in the san-96 aerogel are shown in figure  [ fig : labs ] .",
    "the data for aerogel samples produced at kek(japan ) @xcite are also presented @xcite .",
    "the ashiph system @xcite for the kedr detector @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : atc ] .",
    "the system comprises 160 counters : 80 barrel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] ) and 80 endcap counters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ecap ] ) .",
    "the total volume of aerogel is 800 liters .",
    "the use of aerogel with the refractive index 1.05 gives the possibility to separate pions and kaons in the momentum range @xmath2  gev / c .",
    "an important feature of the project is a two - layer design .",
    "the counter are arranged in such a way that a particle from the interaction point with a momentum above 0.6 gev / c does not cross shifters in both layers simultaneously .",
    "it is possible to use the information from both layers for the essential part of the particles .",
    "we use the multi - layer ptfe film from tetratex company as a reflector .",
    "the results of measurement @xcite of the reflection coefficient for the different thickness of reflector are shown in figure  [ fig : ptfe ] .",
    "the ptfe teflon has four times larger radiation length than the kodak paint . due to using teflon the amount of material in front of the calorimeter",
    "is significantly decreased .",
    "the absorption spectrum of bbq is presented in figure  [ fig : bbqabs ] together with the spectrum of collected cherenkov photons and the absorption spectrum of popop ( kn-18 ) .",
    "the production of plexiglass plates doped with bbq was mastered in institute of polymers at dzerzhinsk .",
    "the cutting , polishing , and twisting were organized in budker institute of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "we use microchannel plate ( mcp ) pmts with multialkali photocathode produced in novosibirsk by `` ekran '' plant @xcite .",
    "the size of this device is small : 31 mm diameter and 17 mm thickness .",
    "the photocathode is 18 mm in diameter .",
    "our measurements of quantum efficiency ( qe ) of this pmt and the fm pmt r6150 are shown in figure  [ fig : qe ] .",
    "the shift of spectral response to the region of longer wavelengths is the essential advantage of mcp pmts in respect of detecting bbq emission .",
    "zh2673 and katod mcp pmt @xmath31570 quantum efficiencies .",
    "popop and bbq emission spectra.,width=226 ]    the decrease of mcp pmt multiplication gain in high magnetic field is not so strong as for fine mesh pmts of hamamatsu . in the magnetic field of 1.5  tesla",
    "the gain drops in some 5 times .",
    "the amount of material in the kedr ashiph system is shown in table  [ tab : amofmat ] .",
    ".the amount of material in the acc system . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : idaccept ]    the amount of material in the pep - n ashiph system is about 20% of @xmath4 .",
    "the use of high transparency aerogel , ashiph method together with the detailed monte carlo calculations have helped us to develop and construct the aerogel cherenkov counters for the kedr detector .",
    "the counters have been tested on beam , 4@xmath1 @xmath0/k  separation has been obtained .",
    "the aerogel cherenkov counters system is proposed for the pep - n detector .",
    "this system is analogous to one developed for the kedr detector .",
