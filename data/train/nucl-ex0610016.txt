    "detection of charged particles provides important information about the reaction mechanisms induced by accelerated heavy ions . for light charged particles ( lcps ) such as protons , deuterons ,",
    "alphas solid - state silicon detectors provide excellent energy , timing and position resolution .",
    "moreover , due to higher density of the detecting medium solid - state silicon detectors offer better opportunity to stop high energy charged particles .",
    "the solid - state detectors are also prone to permanent radiation damage and therefore inadequate for heavy ion detection .",
    "common problems with highly ionizing particles for these detectors are pulse height defect and plasma delay .",
    "corrections in the measurement are then required to get correct information about the energy and rise time of the interacting radiations .",
    "+ in highly ionizing environment , on the other hand , gas detectors offer better options @xcite .",
    "these detectors permit operation under high current rates and high dose environment and the gas can be recycled to maintain the purity of the detecting medium .",
    "gas detectors for charged particles are primarily of two types : 1 ) the low pressure multiwire counters which show excellent position and timing resolutions @xcite and 2 ) relatively high pressure ionization or proportional chambers for identification and energy measurement of various heavy ions emitted from a nuclear reaction .",
    "+ ionization chambers generally operate at the reduced electric field values of @xmath4 @xmath5 1 to 2 volts/(@xmath6torr ) where @xmath7 is the applied electric field and @xmath8 is the gas pressure . in a typical design of an ionization chamber @xcite",
    ", a transverse field is applied .",
    "this field arrangement proves to be disadvantageous as the associated pulse height becomes a function of position where the incident particle impinges @xcite .",
    "although , this problem is solved by the introduction of a frisch grid to the ionization chamber , in an axial field configuration a frisch grid is not always useful .",
    "+ the present work describes the performance of a @xmath0 ionization chamber working in the axial field configuration .",
    "the advantage of using an axial field in a @xmath0 detector over the more usual transverse field has been discussed in ref [ 4,5 ] . since",
    "then there has been no studies or development on this form of gas detector .",
    "extensive studies on the different parameters are sparse in the literature . in this paper",
    "we have made a detailed study on the different operating parameters of our detector . the gas pressure , bias voltage and window foil thickness of the chamber have been optimized .",
    "earlier studies [ 4,5 ] have given little or no importance to the anode structure on the detector performance .",
    "a parallel wire anode structure has been used for the first time to achieve very high transparency and its possible effects on the energy resolution have been addressed .",
    "fig.1 shows the construction of the detector used in the present studies .",
    "the body of the detector is made of aluminium with an active area of 45@xmath945 mm@xmath3 .",
    "the window is an aluminized mylar foil mounted by grease ( non outgassing at pressures of at least 10@xmath10 torr ) and held by an o - ring in a brass flange .",
    "the window foil is maintained at ground potential by contact with the screws of the brass flange .",
    "the anode structure is located in the middle of the chamber and is mounted on a brass plate of active area 34@xmath934 mm@xmath3 and thickness 2 mm .",
    "the plate is provided with a hole of diameter 20 mm .",
    "the anode structure is in the form of conducting parallel thin wires or mesh and is mounted on a 1.5 mm thin copper clad g10 board ( pcb ) of area 30@xmath930 mm@xmath3 with a square hole 20@xmath920 mm@xmath3 .",
    "the anode assembly is fixed by teflon screws with the central brass plate which is stepped down by the pcb thickness .",
    "different thin wire structures ( parallel or crossed ) in the anode are used to study its effect on the energy resolution of the detector . in order to maintain the uniformity of the electric field gradient along the incident particle path",
    "two additional brass plates are kept at half the anode voltage at 10 mm on either side of the anode . in this way",
    "the separation between the plates is made smaller compared to their lengths so that the effect of non - uniform electric field can be ignored .",
    "the brass plates are of the same thickness and area as that of the central plate except the hole is kept empty . the 20 mm hole of the guard plates and that of the anode are coaxial with the 5 mm hole of the window .",
    "the separation of the first guard plate from the window and the last guard plate to the exit is 9.5 mm .",
    "since the detector will be ultimately used as a @xmath11@xmath7 detector the anode is centrally located so that the active volume is extended on both sides of the anode plane . + the voltage to the anode",
    "is provided by a kovar seal and the divided voltage to the plates is provided by a breeder ( resistive ) circuit placed inside the chamber .",
    "the plates with applied voltage are isolated from the ground by g10 spacers which cover the inner walls perpendicular to the window and exit side .",
    "the body of the detector at the window ( including the window foil ) and the exit side is at ground .",
    "this ensures the field lines along the axis of the chamber .",
    "the dc current path and other details of the equivalent circuit describing the resistive gradient is shown in fig.2 .",
    "calibrated resistances of value 50 m@xmath12 are used to make the resistive gradient .",
    "resistive noise in our case was negligible .",
    "the noise level at the preamplifier stage was within 15 mv .",
    "one side of the detector is flanged with a viton o - ring for dismantling and testing .",
    "the gas inlet - outlet and provision for evacuation of the detector are shown in the figure 1 .",
    "the system is pumped down to 10@xmath13 torr vacuum and charged with gas at the desired pressure .",
    "the detector is now ready to be tested .",
    "the detector performance was tested with a @xmath14cf @xmath15-source .",
    "the @xmath15-source was collimated to fall on the entrance window which is 5 mm in diameter",
    ". the collimation and thickness of the window foil plays an important role on the resolution of the detector .",
    "we used a collimation of 1 mm and mylar foils for the window of two different thickness .",
    "the detector was filled with gas between 60 - 600 torr pressure .",
    "two different gases ar(90@xmath16)-ch@xmath17(10@xmath16 ) and isobutane were used to compare the performance of the chamber in each case .",
    "the output of the detector was fed to a charge sensitive preamplifier ( ortec 142ih ) and to a spectroscopy amplifier ( ortec 672 ) and finally to a 2k adc mca ( ortec maestro-32 ) .",

    "the energy calibration for the @xmath0 detector was performed with a @xmath19am and @xmath14cf @xmath15-particle ( 5.485 mev and 6.12 mev respectively ) energy loss and its correlation with the pulse heights .",
    "the stopping power of @xmath15 particles in gases are well accounted by the bethe - bloch formula @xcite . the mean energy loss ( centroids ) in the gas and mylar window were thus determined from bethe - bloch formula ( code srim @xcite ) with the density of gas scaled by the ratio of desired to the normal gas pressure ( 760 torr ) .",
    "the centroid of the data was obtained by an in - built fitting software of the mca .",
    "this method of energy calibration for @xmath0 detectors using simulated energy loss have been adopted in studies with solid - state detectors @xcite .",
    "two different window foils of thickness 1.5 and 8 @xmath18 m were examined . for the thicker foil the resolution varied between 9 - 13@xmath16 fwhm whereas for the 1.5 @xmath18 m window the resolution was much better ( 6 - 8@xmath16 fwhm ) .",
    "a possible reason for this is that higher straggling effects in the thicker window foil degrades the resolution of the detector . as the area of the window aperture is small noticeable effect of window deformation due to pressure differences on the either side of the window",
    "was not observed .",
    "as far as the working gas is concerned , better performance was obtained with isobutane in comparison to ar(90@xmath16)-ch@xmath17(10@xmath16 ) .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "a reason for this may be due to the higher energy loss per unit pressure in isobutane @xcite .",
    "the optimum gas pressure was found to be at 160 - 200 torr and bias voltage 200 - 250 volts .",
    "we show in fig.4 ( b ) the region of optimum gas pressure ( 160 - 250 torr ) at 200 volts bias . at lower gas pressures ( 60 - 100 torr ) the recombination effect",
    "is overcome earlier though the resolution is poorer than at higher pressures .",
    "the statistical fluctuation in the number of electron ion pairs created is larger at lower pressure due to lower energy loss ( hence poorer resolution ) . at higher pressure",
    "the resolution is mainly limited due to increased recombination [ 4,10 ] .",
    "the energy loss of the alpha particle in the gas and fwhm of the observed peak in energy unit is given in table 1 at anode voltage , @xmath20volt and shaping time@xmath21 .",
    "the operating reduced electric field ( @xmath4 ) was found to be between 1 - 2 volts/(@xmath6torr ) .",
    "a gaussian shaping for optimum signal - to - noise ratio was used and the optimum amplifier shaping time was found to be 3@xmath18s ( charge collection time for our detector is about 400 @xmath22 ) .",
    "the resolution degraded at higher and lower shaping time .",
    "the detector could handle about 500 counts per second with good resolution .",

    "for example , the charge induced due to moving electrons ( @xmath25 ) and positive ions ( @xmath26 ) is given by the shockley - ramo theorem [ 3,20,21 ] as @xmath27dz \\\\ q_{ind}^{(+)}&=&-\\frac{e}{w}\\int_{0}^{d}\\frac{de(z)}{dz } [ \\phi_{w}(z)- \\phi_{w}(0)]dz \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the electronic charge , @xmath29 is the mean energy for ionization , @xmath30 the stopping power of the incident particle in the gas and @xmath31 is the weighting potential in the present case at any point @xmath32 along the particle track , @xmath33 being the anode - cathode separation .",
    "if the particle stops inside the detector active length the upper limit in the integrals should be replaced by the range of the particle .",
    "+ the total induced charge is a result of the motion of all the ionizations that occur along the track between the cathode and anode .",
    "as can be seen from equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , in the electron sensitive operation @xcite of the detector , the anode signal is not proportional to the energy deposited by the particle ( due to the @xmath32 dependence of @xmath34 ) .",
    "this problem can be reduced if a frisch grid is placed between the cathode and anode .",
    "the weighting potential is now suppressed between the cathode and grid ( @xmath35 for @xmath36 ) so that equation ( 3 ) reduces to @xmath37dz \\\\ & -&\\frac{e}{w}\\int_{b}^{d}\\frac{de(z)}{dz } [ \\phi_{w}(d)-\\phi_{w}(z)]dz\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proportionality to energy loss is thus ensured in the region between cathode and grid .",
    "however , the source of non - uniformity ( second term of ( 5 ) ) can not be completely eliminated in an axial mode but can be reduced by keeping the separation between grid and anode small . in this work",
    "we have used a very simple electrode structure keeping the holes in the guard plates empty .",
    "the weighting potential for the present electrode configuration ( @xmath38 ) is calculated by using the formalism of ref @xcite ( subject to the boundary conditions in the present case ) and depicted in fig.7 .",
    "the weighting potential along the axis of the detector is plotted where the distortion in the region between the cathode and the guard plate due to the hole in the plate is maximum .",
    "this effect reduces as one moves away from the axis .",
    "the effect of a guard plate without a hole which entirely suppress @xmath39 between the cathode and grid is shown for comparison . in the practical case",
    "a transparent mesh has to be used .",
    "however use of additional mesh besides the anode may add to a background in the detector spectrum due to unwanted scattering of the incident particles @xcite .",
    "thus in an axial chamber the frisch grid is not completely effective as in a transverse field chamber . +     in the present electrode geometry ( solid line ) along the axis of the detector .",
    "the dotted line repesents the weighting potential for the case of guard plate with no hole.,width=432 ]    if however the bragg - curve of the particle is approximately constant over the detector length , equations ( 3 ) reduces to @xmath40dz\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the constant stopping power .",
    "the result of the integration will always be a function of @xmath33 ( i.e , independent of @xmath32 ) irrespective of the form of @xmath42 .",
    "thus the measured signal will be proportional to the energy lost ( @xmath43 ) by the particle in the detector active length . in the present work the bragg - curve for a 6.12 mev @xmath15 particle and the @xmath14cf fission fragments are almost constant over the cathode - anode gap ( 20 mm ) and so the detector functions satisfactorily as a @xmath0 device .",
    "we have fabricated a gas ionization chamber working in the axial mode charge collection configuration using parallel plate geometry .",
    "the different parameters like the gas type and pressure , anode voltage and anode structure have been optimized .",
    "in particular the effect of anode structure has been studied .",
    "a mesh with parallel array of round wires was found to give better energy resolution .",
    "a higher transparency is found to give better resolution , although a larger fluctuation of the mesh voltage was associated with it .",
    "therefore , a parallel array of 12.5 @xmath18 m round gold plated wires will be used in future to get better resolution .",
