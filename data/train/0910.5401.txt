    "one major problem in constructing a fundamental theory of quantum gravity is the complete lack of any experimental data that could be confronted with the corresponding predictions of the theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is particularly important to find out whether some of the a priori different candidate theories are perhaps just different formulations of the same underlying theory or whether they really belong to different `` universality classes '' .",
    "all candidates describing the same underlying physics in different formulations must agree on the observations that are within the domain of applicability of the hitherto unknown correct theory of quantum gravity . in this way one can at least narrow down the set of independent possibilities among which the experiment must decide in the end .",
    "guided by the experience with yang - mills theory we would expect that in particular the comparison of continuum and lattice approaches should be very instructive and fruitful .",
    "on the side of the continuum approaches , recently a lot of efforts went into the exploration of the asymptotic safety scenario @xcite in the formulation based upon the gravitational average action .",
    "it aims at defining a microscopic quantum field theory of gravity in terms of a complete , i.e. , infinitely extended renormalization group ( rg ) trajectory on the theory space of diffeomorphism invariant functionals of the metric .",
    "the limit of an infinite ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff is taken by arranging this trajectory to approach a non - gaussian fixed point ( ngfp ) at large scales ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this ngfp of the effective average action is not only instrumental in constructing the quantum field theory by dictating how all generalized couplings must `` run '' when the uv regulator scale is sent to infinity , it also determines the physical properties of the resulting regulator - free theory at large _",
    "scales , the behavior of propagators at large momenta , for instance .",
    "we refer to this quantum field theory of the metric , defined in the continuum by means of the effective average action , as quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) .    in the following we are going to review how the mere existence of a non - gaussian fixed point allows us to draw inevitable conclusions about the potential of the conformal factor at small distances .",
    "since this result is not restricted to a specific truncation of the full theory and is related to the very notion of asymptotic safety it is a remarkably robust prediction . in particular it should be possible to confirm it by the corresponding lattice approaches . in this way it might provide an opportunity to transfer the successful cross - fertilization between continuum and lattice approaches in yang - mills theory @xcite to the context of gravity",
    "we are interested in the standard effective potential ( i.e. , the one with vanishing infrared cutoff , @xmath1 ) for the conformal factor of metrics on maximally symmetric spacetimes with the topology of a @xmath2-dimensional sphere @xmath3 .",
    "the starting point is the _ exact _ gravitational effective average action @xcite along some rg trajectory , @xmath4 $ ] , and the related reduced functional @xmath5 \\equiv \\gamma_k [ g_{\\mu\\nu } , g_{\\mu\\nu}]$ ] .",
    "( the ghost arguments are set to zero and are not indicated explicitly . )",
    "the latter functional is assumed to have a representation of the form @xmath6 = \\sum_{\\alpha } \\bar{u}_\\alpha ( k ) \\ : i_\\alpha [ g_{\\mu\\nu } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7\\}$ ] is an infinite set of local and nonlocal `` basis '' functionals , invariant under diffeomorphisms acting on @xmath8 , and the @xmath9 s are the corresponding running coupling constants .",
    "we denote their canonical mass dimensions by @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "hence , since @xmath11 is dimensionless , @xmath12 = - d_\\alpha$ ] . the dimensionless running couplings are defined by @xmath13 so that we may rewrite as @xmath14 = \\sum_{\\alpha } u_\\alpha ( k)\\ : k^{d_\\alpha } i_\\alpha [ g_{\\mu\\nu } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    up to now the metric argument @xmath8 was completely general . at this point",
    "we specialize for metrics on @xmath3 , with a variable radius @xmath15 .",
    "we parametrize them as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the metric on the round @xmath3 with unit radius , and the conformal factor @xmath15 is position independent .",
    "hence @xmath8 is a metric on a round sphere with radius @xmath15 .",
    "we shall denote the volume of the unit-@xmath3 by @xmath18 .",
    "we use conventions such that the coordinates @xmath19 are dimensionless and @xmath15 has the dimension of a length .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain equation we exploited that @xmath26 = \\phi^{d_\\alpha } i_\\alpha [ \\hat{g}_{\\mu\\nu}]$ ] which holds true since @xmath27 has dimension @xmath28 .",
    "( this relation can be regarded the definition of the canonical mass dimension . )",
    "eq .   makes it manifest that if we know a complete rg trajectory @xmath29 we can deduce the exact running potential from it , and in particular its @xmath30 limit , the standard effective potential @xmath31 .",
    "usually we are not in the comfortable situation of knowing trajectories exactly ; nevertheless certain important properties of @xmath32 can be deduced on general grounds . for this purpose",
    "we shall employ the following decoupling argument which is standard in the average action context @xcite .",
    "the basic observation is that the true , i.e. dimensionful coupling constants @xmath33 have a significant running with @xmath34 only as long as the number of field modes integrated out actually depends on @xmath34 .",
    "if there are competing physical cutoff scales such as masses or field amplitudes the running with @xmath34 stops once @xmath34 becomes smaller than the physical cutoff scales .",
    "( see appendix c.3 of @xcite for an example . ) in the case at hand this situation is realized in a particularly transparent way .",
    "the quantum metric is expanded in terms of eigenfunctions of the covariant ( tensor ) laplacian @xmath35 of the metric @xmath36 .",
    "this metric corresponds to a sphere of radius @xmath15 ; hence all eigenvalues of the laplacian are discrete multiples of @xmath37 . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath34 has become as small as @xmath38 , the bulk of eigenvalues is integrated out , and the @xmath9 s no longer change much when @xmath34 is lowered even further .",
    "therefore we can approximate @xmath39    in order to make the approximation strictly valid we have to be slightly more specific about the precise definition of @xmath22 .",
    "the above argument could be spoiled by zero modes of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 in terms of a functional integral over the fluctuation modes of the metric with a non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath35 only . as a result ,",
    "the actual partition function would obtain by a final integration over the zero modes which is not performed here .",
    "the only zero modes relevant in the case at hand are those of the conformal factor .",
    "it is therefore important to keep in mind that @xmath32 has the interpretation of an effective potential in which the conformal fluctuations have not yet been integrated out .",
    "has a simple intuitive interpretation in terms of coarse graining : by lowering @xmath34 below @xmath42 one tries to `` average '' field configurations over a volume that would be larger than the volume of the whole universe .",
    "as this is not possible , the running stops .",
    "note that the @xmath3 topology enters here ; the finite volume of the sphere is crucial .    with the approximation",
    "we obtain the following two equivalent representations of @xmath32 in terms of the dimensionless and dimensionful running couplings , respectively : @xmath43 \\\\",
    "\\label{eff - pot - dimful } u_{\\rm eff } ( \\phi ) & = & \\sigma_d^{-1 } \\sum_{\\alpha } \\bar{u}_\\alpha ( \\phi^{-1 } ) \\:\\phi^{d_\\alpha } i_\\alpha [ \\hat{g}_{\\mu\\nu } ]    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as an application of these representations we consider two special cases .",
    "let us assume the rg trajectory under consideration has a _ classical regime _ between the scales @xmath44 and @xmath45 , meaning that @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "then implies that for @xmath48 , approximately , @xmath49 \\:\\phi^{d_\\alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , this potential has a nontrivial @xmath15-dependence governed by the classical couplings @xmath50 .",
    "next let us explore the consequences which a non - gaussian fixed point has for the effective potential .",
    "we assume that the dimensionless couplings @xmath51 approach fixed point values @xmath52 for @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we make the approximation @xmath53 for @xmath54 with @xmath55 the lower boundary of the asymptotic scaling regime .",
    "then the representation tells us that @xmath56 $ ] if @xmath57 . obviously this potential is completely independent of @xmath15 : @xmath58 in typical applications ( see below )",
    ", @xmath55 equals the planck mass @xmath59 so that @xmath60 is constant for @xmath61 .",
    "is our main result .",
    "it shows that the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point has a characteristic impact on the effective potential of the conformal factor : regardless of all details of the rg trajectory , the potential is completely flat for small @xmath15 .",
    "the interpretation of this result is that for @xmath57 the cost of energy ( euclidean action ) of a sphere with radius @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath15 .",
    "spheres of any radius smaller than @xmath62 are on an equal footing .",
    "this is exactly the kind of fractal - like behavior and scale invariance one would expect near the ngfp @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that except for the decoupling relation no approximation went into the derivation of this result .",
    "it is an exact consequence of the assumed asymptotic safety , the existence of a ngfp governing the short distance behavior .",
    "neither has the theory space been truncated nor have any fields been excluded from the quantization ( such as in conformally reduced gravity the transverse tensors , for instance , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the basis of the above general argument we can not predict how precisely , or how quickly the effective potential flattens when we approach the origin .",
    "however , we expect that its derivative with respect to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , vanishes at @xmath65 .",
    "this has an important physical implication . in general , possible vacuum states of the system ( the `` universe '' )",
    "can be found from the effective field equation @xmath66 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath3-type groundstate candidates have a radius @xmath67 at which @xmath68 .",
    "( note that for metrics of the type @xmath69 the variation @xmath70 corresponds to a partial derivative with respect to @xmath63 . )",
    "thus we see that thanks to the ngfp a vanishing radius @xmath71 has become a vacuum candidate , the @xmath63-derivative of @xmath72 vanishes there .",
    "( to qualify as the true vacuum it should be the global minimum . )",
    "hence the universe has an at least metastable stationary state with @xmath65 , i.e. a state with a vanishing metric expectation value @xmath73 . in this state gravity",
    "is in a _ phase of unbroken diffeomorphism invariance _",
    ", which has already been discussed in the context of asymptotic safety @xcite .",
    "let us finally illustrate the above discussion in the familiar setting of the einstein - hilbert truncation @xcite in @xmath74 which is defined by the ansatz @xmath75 = - \\frac{1}{16 \\pi g_k } \\int{\\rm d}^4 x \\ : \\sqrt{g}\\big ( r(g ) - 2 \\lambda_k \\big )       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting ( [ conf - metric ] ) with @xmath76 we obtain @xmath77 = \\frac{3}{4 \\pi g ( k ) } \\int{\\rm d}^4 x \\",
