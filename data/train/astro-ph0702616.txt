    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft - gamma repeaters are neutron stars many of whose attributes at x - ray , gamma - ray , and infrared wavelengths ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) are best understood in the context of the magnetar model @xcite , according to which their high - energy emission results from the rearrangement and decay of ultra - strong magnetic fields .",
    "much remains to be learned about magnetars , of which only a dozen are known .    is an axp with spin period @xmath3s , unusual in being transient .",
    "identified in early 2003 when its x - ray luminosity increased 100-fold @xcite , by 2007 it has returned to the quiescent state it maintained for at least 24 years @xcite .",
    "uniquely for a magnetar it emits radio waves @xcite , that turned on by early 2004 . unlike in ordinary rotation - powered pulsars , the radio pulses have a flat spectrum and vary in luminosity and shape on daily timescales @xcite .    radio emission from  links magnetars and ordinary pulsars , and provides a new window for learning about the physical characteristics of a magnetar .",
    "for instance , while in principle radio emission could be generated in the corona from closed or open magnetic field lines , the large pulse profile and flux density changes observed on short timescales @xcite appear to point to the latter ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we report on observations of the polarized emission from in an attempt to shed some light on the geometry of the radio - emitting regions of this magnetar .",
    "we have observed  with the parkes 64-m telescope in new south wales , australia , in full - stokes polarimetry mode for a total of 20hr on - source between 2006 april and november .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] summarizes the relevant observations .",

    "a pulsed calibrating signal can be injected at an angle of 45  to the feed probes .    to record data we used either the digital filterbank ( dfb ) or the wide - band correlator ( wbc ) .",
    "the bandwidth , frequency- and time - resolution varied depending on receiver and spectrometer , but typical values were , respectively , 256mhz , 128 channels , and 2048 bins across the pulse profile ( see table  [ tab : obs ] for details ) .",
    "an integer number of pulse periods were folded and recorded to disk in psrfits format for off - line analysis . because the dump time of the spectrometers is @xmath4s , a minimum of two pulse periods were folded in each subscan , with @xmath5 more common .",
    "typically , scans lasting up to @xmath6hr were interspersed with @xmath7min observations of the pulsed calibrator in order to determine the relative gain and phase between the two feed probes . for our purposes ,",
    "the main difference between the 3-level sampling / correlation wbc and the 8-bit precision dfb was the latter s much greater sensitivity to radio frequency interference , which we excised in the frequency- and time - domain during analysis .",
    "we used existing observations of the flux calibrator hydra  a , whose flux density is 43.1 , 20.3 and 8.4jy at 1.4 , 3.2 and 8.4ghz respectively , to determine the system equivalent flux density for the receivers and to flux - calibrate the pulse profiles .",
    "all data were analyzed with the psrchive software package @xcite .",
    "as part of the analysis we corrected the stokes parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , total intensity @xmath10 , and circular polarization @xmath11 ) for the position of the feed probes relative to the telescope meridian and for the parallactic angle of the observation .",
    "we also observed strong pulsars with known polarization characteristics ( such as the vela pulsar ) to provide a check on our polarimetric calibration .",
    "analysis of these pulsars yielded linear polarization @xmath12 , position angle of linear polarization @xmath13 , and @xmath11 matching those in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "to complete polarization calibration for  we had to compute the amount of faraday rotation suffered by the radiation in its passage through the galactic magnetic field .",
    "we determined the rotation measure by measuring pa as a function of frequency within the 256-mhz band at 1.4ghz when the pulsar was strong .",
    "the resulting value , @xmath14radm@xmath1 , did not vary within the quoted uncertainty either as a function of pulse phase or time .",
    "the rm was then used to correct the measured pas and frequency - integrated @xmath15 at all frequencies to their values at infinite frequency so that a comparison could be made between frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pas and @xmath15 shown in figure  [ fig : pol ] therefore represent those emitted at the pulsar .",
    "we also display in the figure the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "together with the integrated column density of free electrons to , @xmath16@xmath17pc @xcite , the rm can be used to determine the average magnetic field strength parallel to the line of sight weighted by electron density , @xmath18 g .",
    "this fairly small value appears reasonable given the location of the pulsar , @xmath19 and @xmath20kpc , for which the large - scale galactic field is mostly in the perpendicular direction , and with at least one reversal along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in spite of the variability of the profiles shown in figure  [ fig : pol ] there are three striking and constant aspects to the polarization profiles .",
    "first , the fractional linear polarization is extremely high , close to 100% , and remains high at all frequencies measured here .",
    "secondly , there is a shallow increase in the pa as a function of rotational phase , which remains essentially unchanged regardless of time or frequency of the observations .",
    "the rate of change is reasonably constant over the `` main '' pulse profile components and is around @xmath21deg@xmath22 . finally , there is little or no circular polarization ( @xmath23 ) in the integrated profiles at any frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] ) , or in individual pulses at 1.4ghz except for occasional levels up to @xmath24 of total intensity in the `` precursor '' pulse components ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] ) .",
    "the emission from  changed in character in late 2006 july @xcite . while daily variations continue unabated , generally the pulse profiles are broader ( compare figs .  [",
    "fig : pol ]  [ a ] and [ b ] ) and the fluxes are lower ( the peak flux densities listed in table  [ tab : obs ] attest to this ) .",
    "in contrast , the general polarization characteristics do not seem to vary .",
    "this suggests that the gross observed changes in profile morphology are not due to detectable changes in the underlying magnetic field geometry of the emission regions .    with the variability of the integrated profiles as a caveat",
    ", we nevertheless attempt to compare the profiles at 1.4 , 3.2 and 8.4ghz . in order to isolate long - term variations ,",
    "we consider for this purpose only data taken in a one - week period in 2006 september .",
    "the double peaked profile gets narrower as the frequency increases and the ratio of the leading to trailing component becomes larger ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pa ] ) .",
    "also , the slow pa sweep ( and absolute value of the pa ) is identical at all frequencies , as expected in the `` rotating vector model '' of @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the radius - to - frequency mapping paradigm in which lower frequencies are emitted farther from the star than higher frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . without detailed geometrical information ,",
    "however , it is difficult to quantify this effect ( for a brief discussion of radius - to - frequency mapping concerning , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the very early days of pulsar astronomy",
    ", it was realized that the observed pa swing could be used to derive the geometry of the star under the assumption that the pa was related to the projection of the dipolar field lines on the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to determine the geometry in the majority of pulsars mainly because of the small longitude range over which they emit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is true of  also .",
    "in addition , it is a priori unclear whether a dipolar field structure holds true in this pulsar , although we proceed on the assumption that it might and see where that leads us . in our post-2006 july data , neither @xmath25 ( the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes ) nor @xmath26 ( the angle of closest approach of the line of sight to the magnetic axis ) can be constrained . the earlier data , with the appearance of pulse components far from the main component ( fig .  [ fig : sp ] ) , are more promising in this regard . here , however , the main uncertainty is whether there is 90  of pa rotation between the widely spaced components .",
    "formal fits to the data both with and without an extra 90  of phase are reasonable ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pafit ] ) . in the former case ,",
    "the fits yield values of @xmath25 near 70  and high values of @xmath26 near 2025 . without the added orthogonal jump ,",
    "the fits yield @xmath27 and @xmath28 implying that the magnetic and rotation axes are almost aligned .",
    "the polarization characteristics of  are very similar to those seen in young pulsar profiles @xcite .",
    "they too are highly linearly polarized , often have double profiles , and show a slow swing of pa across a wide profile .",
    "@xcite showed that a single cone of emission originating from relatively high in the pulsar magnetosphere could explain the observed characteristics of young pulsars and it is tempting to make the same case here .",
    "however , there is a significant difference in the polar cap radius , @xmath29 ( and light cylinder radius @xmath30 ) , between a young pulsar with a period of 0.1s and with its 5.5s period .",
    "this makes it difficult to see how such a wide ( @xmath31 ) observed pulse profile can be produced unless ( a ) the emission height is very large or ( b ) the magnetic and rotation axes are almost aligned .",
    "we will discuss these two possibilities in turn .    in the first case , knowledge of the geometry and the observed pulse width",
    "can be used to compute an emission height . for values of @xmath25 near 70  and @xmath32 , one can use equation  ( 2 ) of @xcite to derive the cone opening angle @xmath33 . in turn",
    "the emission height can be computed as @xmath34 , or @xmath35 km .",
    "this is about 10% of the light cylinder radius  similar to the value in other young pulsars @xcite .",
    "if this scenario were typical of magnetars in general then the beaming fraction would be high and most bright radio active magnetars would likely be detectable in pulsations . in the second case , for small values of @xmath25 ,",
    "the line of sight could remain wholly within the emission beam leading to the observed wide profile . in this case , if @xmath25 were to vary slightly with time ( for reasons unknown ) , there could be a large effect on both the observed beam shape and torque , both of which have been observed to vary significantly @xcite .",
    "perhaps the emission in this particular magnetar could be in part a direct function of the quasi - alignment between the rotation axis and magnetic axis , or perhaps the alignment might occur as a natural process in magnetars . in either case ,",
    "the small polar cap size would make the beaming fraction of such magnetars rather low .",
    "the main difficulty with this interpretation is that the radio and x - ray beams appear to be nearly aligned @xcite and the observed modulation of thermal x - rays is very large ( @xmath36 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would be hard to obtain from a nearly aligned rotator .    in summary , the polarized emission from  shares many characteristics of those in young pulsars generally .",
    "the emission is highly linearly polarized with little evolution with frequency , the pulse profile is wide and double , and there is only a shallow swing of pa through the main pulse .",
    "this leads to the possibility that the `` standard '' pulsar ideas of emission along open magnetic field lines also hold here . in this case , either the magnetic and rotation axes are almost aligned , or the emission originates high above the surface of the star , which is our preferred interpretation .",
    "obvious remaining differences between  and other pulsars are its pulse profile variability ( which does not appear to be accompanied by corresponding gross changes in the magnetic field geometry ) , fluctuating flux density , and flat spectrum .",
