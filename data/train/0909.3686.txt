    "the desired features of our present proposal are : ( i )  full supersymmetry ( susy ) as well as the translational invariance and all global symmetries are manifestly preserved , ( ii )  it is amenable to nonperturbative studies by , for example , monte carlo simulations , ( iii )  the formulation of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0 wz model possesses a well - defined nicolai map  @xcite ( see also refs .",

    "is linearly realized and super transformations generated by @xmath16 do not mix momentum modes with different momenta .",
    "this fact suggests that one can regularize the functional integral of the model by restricting possible momenta of off - shell super multiplets . _",
    "any _ restriction on momenta does not break susy . from a perspective of the euclidean rotational symmetry in the infinite volume , it would be preferable to take a rotational invariant restriction such as  @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an uv cutoff .",
    "thus , one may define a regularized partition function of the wz model by @xmath19     e^{-s}. \\label{onexthree}\\ ] ] to make this expression fully well - defined , we may assume that the system is put in a euclidean box of size  @xmath20 and the momentum  @xmath21 is discrete , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the euclidean action  @xmath24 in the momentum space reads @xmath25 where the symbol  @xmath26 denotes the convolution @xmath27 and the product in the superpotential  @xmath28 in  eq .",
    "( [ onexfour ] ) is defined by repeated applications of this convolution rule .",
    "we see that action  ( [ onexfour ] ) is invariant under a multiplication of operators  ( [ onextwo ] ) on each field variables , because the sum of momenta in action  ( [ onexfour ] ) is zero , corresponding to the translational invariance .",
    "prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) thus manifestly preserves susy as well as the translational invariance .",
    "all global symmetries of the action ( such as the @xmath29-symmetry ) are also manifest .",
    "specifically , one can derive ward - takahashi identities associated with these symmetries within a regularized framework .",
    "since definition  ( [ onexthree ] ) does not modify the spinor - space structure of the wz model , one may repeat the proof of perturbative non - renormalization theorems  @xcite in this regularized framework ( cf .  ref .",
    "one may also repeat the argument of  ref .",
    "@xcite because the holomorphy is manifestly preserved .",
    "furthermore , prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) is amenable to nonperturbative studies by , for example , monte carlo simulations , because eq .  ( [ onexthree ] ) is a finite - dimensional integral for finite @xmath18 and  @xmath20 .",
    "the above description sounds too good to be true . actually , it is not clear whether definition  ( [ onexthree ] ) ( in the limit that the uv and ir cutoffs are removed , @xmath30 and  @xmath31 ) is consistent with the expected locality in the target theory .",
    "the reflection positivity is a related issue .",
    "prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) differs from the conventional momentum cutoff in perturbative feynman integrals , with which the locality would be obvious .",
    "the point is that the restriction @xmath32 on integration variables in  eq .",
    "( [ onexthree ] ) could introduce non - smooth dependence of a feynman integral on external momenta ; such dependence could not be interpreted as an insertion of local operators .",
    "see the analysis in  appendix . because the notion of locality becomes transparent only in this limit .",
    "]    now , if the model is massive , @xmath33 , the free super propagators are given by @xmath34 where the momentum contained in @xmath35 and  @xmath36 is  @xmath21 . in prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) , the functional integral is defined in terms of momentum modes .",
    "one may then define the field variable in the real space by  @xmath37 .",
    "then free super propagators in the real space are proportional to @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the ( modified ) bessel function . in the right - hand side , the first term is the standard massive propagator which dumps exponentially  @xmath41 .",
    "the second term is the cutoff effect and its amplitude dumps only in the inverse powers of  @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath18 is kept fixed , the second term dominates the first for @xmath42 large . nevertheless , since the second term is integrable at  @xmath43 , the second term with @xmath42 kept fixed vanishes as  @xmath30 .",
    "free propagators in the real space thus restore the expected locality for  @xmath30 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of interaction . in prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) , only momentum modes with @xmath32 appear and , in perturbation theory , this restriction can be taken into account by substituting all factors @xmath44 in  eqs .",
    "( [ twoxone])([twoxfour ] ) by  @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the step function .",
    "the locality is not obvious in general with this prescription as illustrated in  appendix .",
    "nevertheless , if a convergence property of a feynman integral is good enough , the value of the feynman integral must be independent of the regularization as  @xmath30 ; then the issue of locality and reflection positivity should not matter . since our formulation preserves manifest susy",
    ", we expect a better convergence property of feynman integrals compared with formulations which do not have manifest susy .",
    "since susy is manifest with prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) , one can determine the superficial degrees of divergence on the basis of the super feynman rule ( see  ref .",

    ", the perturbative renormalizability requires the superpotential is cubic @xmath56 .",
    "then eq .  ( [ twoxsix ] ) yields @xmath57 and we see that only two - point functions may logarithmically diverge ( tadpoles , for which @xmath58 , identically vanish owing to the non - renormalization theorem ; see  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for such divergent diagrams ,",
    "the locality is not obvious .",
    "in fact , as explained in  appendix , we could neither prove nor disprove consistency of prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) with the expected locality beyond the one - loop level .",
    "thus we must admit that the validity of prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) is not clear for 4d wz model .",
    "for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) system , @xmath59 , if the superpotential is cubic @xmath56 , we have @xmath60 and , since again the tadpoles identically vanish owing to susy , all feynman diagrams have strictly negative superficial degrees of divergence .",
    "for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , @xmath61 , for any ( polynomial ) superpotential , we have @xmath62 and again all feynman diagrams have strictly negative superficial degrees of divergence .",
    "the above counting shows that , in 3d @xmath63 wz model with the cubic superpotential and in 2d @xmath0 wz model with arbitrary superpotential , all 1pi diagrams have strictly negative superficial degrees of divergence .",
    "combined this with the power - counting theorem  @xcite , we see that all feynman integrals in these lower - dimensional models are _",
    "absolutely convergent_. we then intuitively expect that , owing to this good convergence property , the correct ( finite ) value of feynman diagrams is reproduced with prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) in the @xmath30 limit . then there will be no need to worry about the locality and the reflection positivity for  @xmath30 .",
    "this natural expectation is rigorously confirmed by the following    for any feynman integral @xmath64 where @xmath65 are loop momenta and @xmath21  collectively denotes external momenta , that is absolutely convergent @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 for any fixed  @xmath21 , where @xmath68 is a modified integrand that is defined by substituting all propagators @xmath69 in the original integrand  @xmath70 by  @xmath71 .    from the definition of  @xmath68 , @xmath72 , \\label{twoxnine}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73  denotes the number of propagators and propagators momenta  @xmath74 are linear combinations of  @xmath75 and  @xmath21 .",
    "for fixed  @xmath21 , for sufficiently large  @xmath18 , there exists a region containing the origin of  @xmath76 of size  @xmath77 , @xmath78 , such that @xmath79 for  @xmath80 . setting @xmath81 ,",
    "since @xmath82 for  @xmath80 and  @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 we then take the @xmath30 limit on the both sides of  eq .",
    "( [ twoxten ] ) .",

    "this shows eq .",
    "( [ twoxeight ] ) .    to summarize , to all orders of perturbation theory , definition  ( [ onexthree ] ) provides a valid formulation of 3d @xmath63 wz model with the cubic superpotential and of 2d @xmath0 wz model with arbitrary superpotential .",
    ", new logarithmic divergences may appear and the present argument does not apply . ]",
    "we thus propose to use eq .",
    "( [ onexthree ] ) as a nonperturbative definition of these models .",
    "as already noted , all symmetries in the target theory are manifest and , moreover , the formulation is amenable to nonperturbative monte carlo simulations .",
    "as noted in  introduction , the susy invariance holds with any restriction on possible momenta of super multiplets . for example , since the rotational symmetry is in any case broken in a finite box , one may adopt a `` cubic '' restriction  @xmath88 for all  @xmath7 , rather than the `` spherical one '' @xmath32 , and @xmath89     e^{-s } , \\label{twoxeleven}\\ ] ] where the action  @xmath24 is again given by  eq .",
    "( [ onexfour ] ) .",
    "this prescription shares desired features with eq .",
    "( [ onexthree ] ) , such as susy is manifest and the locality is restored in the @xmath30 limit for lower - dimensional models ( to all orders of perturbation theory ; lemma  1 can appropriately be modified for the cubic momentum restriction above ) .",
    "prescription  ( [ twoxeleven ] ) is , however , nothing but a lattice formulation of the wz model in  ref .  @xcite that is based on the slac lattice derivative  @xcite . in fact , if one expresses the lattice formulation in  ref .",
    "@xcite ( eqs .  ( 2.10 ) and  ( 2.27 ) there , after the wick rotation ) in terms of momentum modes @xmath90 , where @xmath91  denotes the lattice point , one ends up with  eq .",
    "( [ twoxeleven ] ) with the identification  @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "since two prescriptions  ( [ onexthree ] ) and  ( [ twoxeleven ] ) should be essentially equivalent for  @xmath30 , our proposal  ( [ onexthree ] ) is basically equivalent to the lattice formulation in  ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the slac derivative .",
    "the slac derivative is not usually adopted in lattice ( gauge ) theory , because the locality could be violated  @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "this is also the case with our prescription for 4d wz model ; as discussed in  appendix , the consistency of prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) with locality is not clear for 4d wz model .",
    "however , as we have discussed so far , the prescription can be consistent with the locality in lower - dimensional models and we can expect the same for prescription  ( [ twoxeleven ] ) .",
    "thus , from this perspective , our contribution in the present letter is merely in that we gave a strong affirmative argument for the applicability of the formulation in  ref .",
    "@xcite to 3d @xmath63 and 2d @xmath0 wz models , dimensional reductions of the original 4d @xmath94 wz model . on the other hand",
    ", we have to say that its validity for 4d wz model itself is still not clear , unfortunately .",
    "2d @xmath0 wz model is interesting in its own right , because , for example , it provides the landau - ginsburg model for @xmath0 superconformal field theory  @xcite . in the dimensional reduction from four to two dimensions , we set @xmath95 and  @xmath96 directions unreduced .",
    "then , from  eq .  ( [ onexfour ] ) , in terms of component fields in  eq .",

    "since susy is manifest in our formulation , we could repeat the argument in , for example , sec .  2 of  ref .",
    "@xcite . for the argument there , important fermionic symmetries are ( in the notation of  ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath101 and @xmath102 these nilpotent symmetries imply that , among correlation functions of scalar fields  @xmath103 , only those of zero momentum modes @xmath104 can be nontrivial .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath103 with  @xmath105 are @xmath106 or  @xmath107 exact and @xmath103 are closed under @xmath106 and  @xmath107 .",

    "thus , for  @xmath110 , susy can not be spontaneously broken .",
    "] moreover , since the anti - holomorphic part of the superpotential is @xmath106 or  @xmath107 exact , correlation functions of  @xmath104 depend on parameters in the superpotential only holomorphically ( i.e. , they depend on  @xmath111 but not on  @xmath112 )",
    ". it is interesting that our prescription provides a solid basis for these arguments which assume a supersymmetric regularization . in the context of the landau - ginsburg model for the superconformal field theory",
    ", one has to consider the massless ( or critical ) limit .",
    "since in this limit perturbation theory suffers from severe infrared divergences , it must be important to formulate the system nonperturbatively .",
    "it is well known that 2d @xmath0 wz model possesses the nicolai map  @xcite which is a mapping that `` trivializes '' the functional integral .",
    "wz model ( on a 2d cylinder ) , a regularized hermitian supercharge and an associated hamiltonian have been constructed and the existence of their finite limit ( as the uv cutoff goes to infinity ) has rigorously been proven  @xcite .",
    "although on general grounds we expect that if the theory exists the limit that the uv cutoff is removed is unique , to show the equivalence of the present prescription to the construction of  refs .",
    "@xcite is far beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we expect that the nicolai map provides a useful clue to show such a nonperturbative finiteness in our approach . ]",
    "action  ( [ threexone ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath113 , \\label{threexfour}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 and  @xmath115 are shifted auxiliary fields and the combinations @xmath116 and  @xmath117 define the nicolai map @xmath118 from  eq .",
    "( [ threexfour ] ) , one sees that the fermion determinant is precisely the jacobian associated with change of integration variables  ( [ threexfive ] ) .",
    "thus , after the integration over the fermion field , the bosonic integration variables become @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , the action  @xmath24 becomes gaussian in  @xmath119 after the integration over the auxiliary fields  @xmath120 and  @xmath121 . in this way , the functional integral is trivialized by map  ( [ threexfive ] ) .",
    "note that , in functional integral  ( [ onexthree ] ) , the momentum of auxiliary fields @xmath120 and  @xmath121 is restricted to  @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , in  eq .",
    "( [ threexfour ] ) , only @xmath116 and  @xmath117 with  @xmath32 appear . that is , in prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) , nicolai map  ( [ threexfive ] ) is a mapping from  @xmath122 to  @xmath119 , both are subject of identical momentum restriction  @xmath32 . in this sense ,",
    "the nicolai map is well - defined with prescription  ( [ onexthree ] ) .",
    "the existence of the nicolai map provides a quite interesting simulation algorithm for the present system .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for actual implementation of this idea in a discretized real space .",
    "one first generates a set of gaussian random numbers with the unit covariance ; this gives a configuration of  @xmath119 .",
    "then one inverts nicolai map  ( [ threexfive ] ) by numerical means .",
    "there may exist several inverse images and one must in principle find all of them .",
    "this provides configuration(s ) of  @xmath122 .",
    "repeating these steps , one obtains a statistical ensemble of  @xmath122 .",
    "correlation functions of the fermion field can also be obtained from bosonic ones without inversion ( by assuming that susy is not spontaneously broken ) .",
    "a great advantage of this algorithm is that , compared with conventional methods based on the markov process , there is ( in principle ) _ no _ autocorrelation between configurations in the obtained ensemble .",
    "another important point to note is that the fermion determinant in the present system is generally complex and thus conventional methods may fail owing to the sign problem , while the algorithm based on the nicolai map seems to be free from this difficulty . in the near future , we hope to carry out monte carlo simulations of 2d @xmath0 wz model on the basis of the nicolai map in the present momentum - space formulation .",
    "we would like to thank tetsuo horigane , hiroki kawai , yoshio kikukawa and  fumihiko sugino for enlightening and enjoyable discussions .",
    "this work was initially motivated by jun  saito s talk at the yitp workshop , `` development of quantum field theory and string theory '' ( yitp - w-09 - 04 ) .",
    "the work of h.s .  is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research , 18540305 .",
    "after completing this work , we became aware of a paper by georg bergner  @xcite in which a lattice monte carlo simulation of the susy quantum mechanics ( qm )  @xcite was carried out on the basis of a `` full supersymmetric model '' .",
    "this lattice formulation is just the supersymmetric lattice formulation of  ref .",
    "@xcite applied to susy qm .",
    "since susy qm is uv finite with a supersymmetric regularization , a variant of lemma  1 ensures the restoration of locality in this formulation to all orders of perturbation theory .",
