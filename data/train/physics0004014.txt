    "<S> # 1    0.1 in    pacs number(s ) : 03.20.+i 0.1 in    in a previous paper hereafter denoted as i @xcite , the non - uniqueness of the factorization of linear second - order differential operators has been exploited on the example of the classical newtonian free damped oscillator , i.e. @xmath2 the coefficient @xmath3 is the friction constant per unit mass and @xmath4 is the natural frequency of the oscillator ( si units assumed all over the work ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the more general supersymmetric partner equation @xmath5 has been obtained in i. this new second - order linear damping equation contains the additional last term with respect to its initial partner ( 1 ) , which may be thought of as the general darboux transform part of the frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 occurs as a new time scale in the newtonian damping problem . </S>",
    "<S> if this time scale is infinite , the ordinary free damping is recovered unless for the critical case which is special even in ordinary damping . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in i , the @xmath0 modes can be obtained from the @xmath1 modes by operatorial means . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall call them @xmath7 modes . for the three types of free damping </S>",
    "<S> they have been obtained in i as follows :    \\(i ) for underdamping , @xmath8 , denoting @xmath9 the underdamped @xmath7 modes are @xmath10~. \\eqno(3)\\ ] ]    \\(ii ) for overdamping , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the overdamped @xmath7 modes are @xmath13~. \\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    \\(iii ) for critical damping , @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> in practice the new parameter @xmath7 can be very close to zero . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it is very difficult to differentiate the @xmath7 modes from the ordinary ones . </S>",
    "<S> the only means we can think of is by recording somehow the geometric angle associated to the @xmath7 modes and compare it with the same quantity in the ordinary damping cases . </S>",
    "<S> one is led to this conclusion noticing that the @xmath7 modes have time - dependent frequencies @xmath16 and hence for them the ermakov - lewis ( el ) procedure can be naturally applied @xcite ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath17 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) can be reduced to a bessel equation and the solutions can be written as follows @xmath18 e^{-\\beta \\tau } \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] and @xmath19 e^{-\\beta \\tau}~ , \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . when @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) , we can do hankel s asymptotic expansions , i.e. , of large bessel argument but fixed bessel order ( we shall not reproduce these formulas here , the reader is directed to abramowitz and stegun @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that one is indeed able to get the solutions obtained by operatorial means from inspecting hankel s expansions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the supersymmetric operatorial procedure gives merely the asymptotic @xmath23 solutions , which however could be the most relevant from the physical viewpoint in this context .    in the el approach </S>",

    "<S> thus , the total angle will be @xmath26 the so - called pinney function @xmath27 is the solution of pinney s nonlinear equation @xcite @xmath28 for @xmath29 constant ( = 1 ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for @xmath32 constant </S>",
    "<S> there is a definite prescription of calculating @xmath27 in terms of two independent solutions of the corresponding linear equation . </S>",
    "<S> we have followed the method of eliezer and gray @xcite for @xmath33 in terms of linear combinations of the aforementioned bessel functions ( for @xmath34 ) that satisfy the initial conditions as given by those authors . in the critical damping case </S>",
