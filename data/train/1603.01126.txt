    "in recent years , the possibility to build @xcite elementary cavity quantum electrodynamics systems , whether formed by an atom in a cavity @xcite or by a josephson junction coupled to microwave photons on a chip @xcite , opened the perspective to construct new many body systems from such elementary building blocks .",
    "the jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model @xcite is the simplest model describing such an array of coupled cavities .",
    "each cavity consists of a two - level system ( describing the atom or the junction ) coupled to a unique mode of the cavity .",
    "the cavities are then coupled by tunneling of photons from one cavity to the next . in this many - cavity system , it was predicted that a phenomenon similar to a photon blockade @xcite would take place , leading to a phase transition transition between a coherent state , where all the cavities are in phase , and an incoherent state where the number of excitations per cavity is quantized , reminiscent of the mott - superfluid transition observed in the bosonic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "non equilibrium properties of such systems have also been extensively discussed @xcite .    in the jch model description of such a system ,",
    "the total number of excitons , @xmath0 , the sum of the number of photons @xmath1 and of excited atoms ( also referred to as spins ) @xmath2 , is a conserved quantity .",
    "however , a complete description of the interaction between the two - level system and the photon field should include , as described by the rabi hamiltonian @xcite , so - called counter - rotating ( cr ) terms that do not conserve the number of excitations . neglecting these terms , which is generally called the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ,",
    "is generally valid due to the very small values of the coupling @xmath3 between the field and the material device .",
    "compared to the energy of a photon @xmath4 , @xmath3 generally ranges from @xmath5 in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) experiments up to @xmath6 in circuit qed @xcite .    however , it was recently remarked that , for larger values of @xmath3 , these cr terms may modify deeply the physics of these systems @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "schiro _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the rabi - hubbard ( rh ) model , which is equivalent to the jch model with the addition of counter - rotating terms , both in the interaction and the hopping terms .",
    "this model has different symmetry properties from the jch model and consequently different transitions .",
    "the studies performed in @xcite show that the rh model does not exhibit mott insulating behavior , but rather an incoherent / coherent transition which resembles the superradiant transition of the dicke model @xcite .",
    "the out of equilibrium behavior of the rh model has been recently studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the related dicke model and the nature of its transition are also the subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show the breakdown of the rwa approximation by reaching an ultra strong coupling regime in circuit qed @xcite where @xmath7 .    in order to study the differences between the rh and jch descriptions of these systems , we will use exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "whereas the jch model has been studied with dmrg @xcite and qmc @xcite the rh model has mostly been studied with mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "@xcite mapped the rh model onto the quantum ising model in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath8 ) and compared their results with dmrg simulations .",
    "they found that the qpt of the rh model is well described by the dynamics of the quantum ising model .",
    "however , their calculation was done with the number of photons per cavity restricted to be at most equal to @xmath9 . as we will see below",
    ", the number of photons per cavity can far exceed this value in the coherent phase .",
    "in addition , the dmrg calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite was done without the cr terms in the hopping .",
    "below , we will study the effect of these terms .    the jch and rh models we will study in this paper are but two of a very wide variety of related models describing a large spectrum of interesting physical situations of current interest . for example , ref .",
    "@xcite introduces a model of spins coupled to photons which are exchanged at all distances and where the photon band is _ flat _ , which is a key difference with the model we address here .",
    "another interesting class of models is that where the band is not flat and where , in addition , spin - photon coupling is mode dependent and chosen to lead to an ohmic spectral density at low enough frequencies @xcite .",
    "these models can also be studied with the qmc algorithm we use in this paper .    in section",
    "ii , we review the model , the technique used to simulate it and the physical quantities of interest for this study . in section iii , we present the phase diagram of the model and compare it with previously known results , focusing on the case where the detuning is zero . in section iv",
    ", we discuss in more detail the importance of the counter - rotating terms and their effects .",
    "we study the rabi - hubbard model on a one - dimensional periodic chain with @xmath10 sites .",
    "each site of the chain , labelled with index @xmath11 , represents a cavity ( fig .",
    "[ schema ] ) . in each cavity",
    "there is a two - level atom represented as a spin-1/2 and we consider only one photon mode per cavity .",
    "the atom is coupled to the mode with the rabi - hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the sites are coupled to each other by a photon hopping term connecting near neighbor cavities via the tunnel effect . the rabi - hubbard ( rh ) hamiltonian governing this system is @xcite @xmath12 the @xmath13 describes the destruction ( creation ) of photons in the @xmath11-th cavity .",
    "the @xmath14 operators describe the two - level atoms . the first term in eq.([hbasic ] )",
    "describes the hopping of photons between cavities ; the second term , which is diagonal , describes the energies of the photons and the excited atomic states .",
    "the third term describes the exchange between the atom and the photons field .",
    "we will call @xmath15 the detuning between the atomic and light frequencies    written in this form , the hamiltonian includes counter - rotating terms ( cr ) : terms which create two photons ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) in the first line of eq.([hbasic ] ) or which simultaneously excite a spin and create a photon ( @xmath18 ) in the third , and their hermitian conjugates .",
    "this last term is often neglected in the treatment of the rabi model as it couples states with different diagonal energies .",
    "the non - rotating terms in the hopping part of the hamiltonian are probably not physical but were studied in @xcite and allow us to study the effects of two different non rotating terms . ignoring these terms in eq.([hbasic ] ) , what is generally called the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , transforms the model into the jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "there is an important qualitative difference between these models .",
    "the jch model conserves the number of excitations @xmath19 and has u(1 ) symmetry whereas the rh model does not have such a conservation law and has a simpler @xmath20 symmetry .    to study the differences between the jch and rh models , we perform exact numerical simulations using the stochastic green function ( sgf ) quantum monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "this numerical technique is able to tackle the non - conservation of the number of excitations and the large number of photons present in the rh model .",
    "this allowed us the study its phase diagram and simulate sizes up to @xmath21 sites and inverse temperatures @xmath22 .",
    "we chose to study a one dimensional lattice where results can easily be compared with dmrg studies of the jch @xcite and rh @xcite models and because of the limited number of sites we can study . to study in more details the effects of the cr terms , we generalize slightly the forms of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath23 . the hopping term will then be replaced with @xmath24 and the rabi term with @xmath25 where we introduce separate parameters for the rotating and counter - rotating terms ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) .",
    "we measure the number of photons @xmath1 or the total number of excitations @xmath0 and the corresponding densities @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 ; we also measure various green functions @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are creation or destruction operators for the photons ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) or the spins ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) .",
    "this allows us to study the phase coherence of photons , spins and coherence between photons and spins .",
    "for example , we will measure the photon equal - time green function @xmath37 this yields the photon condensate fraction , @xmath38 , which is the order parameter for the phase coherence of photons : @xmath39 combining different spin - spin correlation functions such as @xmath40 we obtain the spin - spin correlation @xmath41 at the largest distance @xmath42 in the system which exposes the coupling of the atoms via the photon field .",
    "we start with the rabi - hubbard model at @xmath43 and with : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we take @xmath46 to fix the energy scale and we study the phase diagram as @xmath47 is varied for a fixed value of @xmath3 .",
    "we observed , as predicted in @xcite , that the system undergoes an evolution from an incoherent phase , at low @xmath23 , to a coherent one , at large @xmath23 .",
    "the incoherent phase is characterized by exponential decay of all the green functions with distance indicating the absence of long range and quasi - long range order in the system ( fig .",
    "[ green ] , left ) .",
    "this means that the photons are not coherent at long distance and that the spins are also not ordered .",
    "the density of photons , equal to @xmath48 , is also small in this phase , of the order of @xmath49 in the case presented here .    at large @xmath23",
    "we observe , on the contrary , a phase where all the green functions remain non - zero at large distances ( fig .",
    "[ green ] , right ) .",
    "the photons form a coherent field across the system and the spins adopt a ferromagnetic order along the @xmath50-axis .",
    "the spins and photons are correlated with each other at long distances , as is shown by the behavior of mixed green functions such as @xmath51 .",
    "finally , the density of photons becomes larger ( around 1.4 in the present case ) in this coherent phase .    ) ) as a function of distance in the incoherent ( left ) and coherent ( right ) phases . in the incoherent phase ,",
    "all the green functions decay exponentially . in the coherent phase ,",
    "all the green functions show a plateau behavior , reaching a constant value at long distance .",
    "this is due to the discrete symmetry of the rabi - hubbard model .",
    "[ green],width=332 ]    to study the transition between the incoherent and coherent regimes for the photons , we will look at the evolution of the condensate fraction @xmath38 . the value of @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ cond_frac ] ) is not zero for small @xmath23 while we observe that all the green functions ( see fig .",
    "[ green ] , left ) decrease exponentially in this phase .",
    "we will show that this non - zero @xmath38 is only a finite size effect .",
    "@xmath38 increases as the system becomes coherent at larger @xmath23 .",
    "a striking feature is that @xmath38 almost reaches its saturation value of unity for large @xmath23 indicating that all the photons are condensed .",
    "this is atypical in one dimension , where one usually encounters quasi - condensation of the photons . in the present case",
    ", the condensation is due to the discrete @xmath20 symmetry of the rh model .",
    "this is also visible in the behavior of the green functions in the coherent phase ( fig .",
    "[ green ] , right ) where all the green functions reach plateaux with constant values at large distances , instead of the power law decay generally observed in one dimension .",
    "another important feature is that we observe only the two phases , incoherent and coherent photon phases , with no sign of any mott insulator where @xmath38 would be zero for commensurate densities .",
    "this result confirms the mean field analysis of @xcite .",
    "( eq.([condfraction ] ) ) of the photons as a function of @xmath47 for detuning @xmath43 .",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition from an incoherent field to a coherent field as the coupling @xmath23 .",
    "[ cond_frac],width=332 ]    the spin - spin correlations @xmath52 follow the behavior of the condensate fraction ( fig .",
    "[ ss ] ) : as the photons become coherent , the spins couple to the photon field and become ferromagnetic ( or ferroelectric in terms of polarization of the atoms ) .",
    "once again , we find true long range order for the spin - spin correlations ( fig .",
    "[ green ] ) which tend to their saturated value of @xmath53 when @xmath47 becomes large .",
    "we observe that both @xmath38 and @xmath52 become large simultaneously , which suggests that there is no intermediate phase where one species is coherent while the other is not .",
    "the transition is similar to the dicke transition @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the rh and dicke models is that only one photonic mode is present in the latter , while there are several in the former .",
    "however ( fig .",
    "[ green ] , right ) @xmath54 reaches a plateau at long distance .",
    "there is then a bose condensation of the photons with a macroscopic occupation of the @xmath55 mode in fourier space .",
    "indeed , the number of photons @xmath56 occupying a fourier mode of wave vector @xmath57 is simply the fourier transform of @xmath54 .",
    "then , despite the fact that there are many photon modes , the system selects the lowest energy one when it becomes coherent and the resulting coherent phase is very similar to that in the dicke system .",
    "similarities between the jch and dicke model were discussed in @xcite .",
    "( eq.([sscorr ] ) ) at the maximum distance @xmath58 as a function of @xmath47 for detuning @xmath43 and for different sizes . as the photons become coherent ( see fig .",
    "[ cond_frac ] ) , the system becomes  ferromagnetic \" .",
    "[ ss],width=332 ]    to determine more precisely the transition point between the incoherent and coherent phases , we perform finite size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "this one - dimensional system has discrete @xmath20 symmetry and , consequently , its ground state quantum phase transitions belong to the classical two - dimensional ising model universality class .",
    "the order parameter is @xmath59 ( or , equivalently , the magnetization of the spin along the @xmath50-axis ) . at the critical point",
    ", we expect the order parameter to scale like @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the critical exponents .",
    "hence , @xmath63 is independent of @xmath10 at the transition which allows us to determine the critical point @xmath64 with good precision ( fig .",
    "[ fss ] ) .",
    "in addition , we confirmed ( not shown here ) the collapse of curves for different system sizes in the critical region by using the rescaled transition parameter @xmath65",
    ". this confirms the two - dimensional ising universality class of the transition .",
    "performing such analysis for many different values of @xmath3 allows us to determine the transition line between incoherent and coherent regions in the @xmath66 plane .",
    ", the transition is located around @xmath67 .",
    "[ fss],width=332 ]    we also analysed this transition by doing the mean - field ( mf ) analysis previously performed by schir _",
    "@xcite , which we brifely review here . as the kinetic terms are the only ones that couple sites , we can replace them , for each site , with a coupling to an external homogeneous field @xmath68 for all @xmath11 .",
    "we are then left with a collection of identical on - site mf hamiltonians @xmath69 these on - site hamiltonians can be numerically diagonalized , in the standard way , by truncating a basis for a large enough number of photons and a self consistent solution is obtained when the mean value of @xmath70 calculated in the ground state is equal to the field @xmath71 inserted in the hamiltonian .",
    "this also corresponds to a minimum value of the energy with respect to @xmath71 as the method is variational .    to analyse the number of photons",
    ", we will now use an even simpler approximation , where we replace all photon operators @xmath70 ( @xmath16 ) by one c - number @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is a simple coherent state approach that should be valid in the coherent phase when the photon number is large enough to neglect fluctuations .",
    "our problem is then reduced to simple mf hamiltonians @xmath73 , with only two states , describing independent spins coupled to the same perfectly coherent field , @xmath74 due to the @xmath20 symmetry of the problem , the value of @xmath71 that minimizes the energy can be chosen real and positive .",
    "solving this two - state problem yields an expression for the transition line : @xmath75 and the density of photons in the coherent region , @xmath76 this reduces to @xmath77 for @xmath78 where the approximation should be valid . the number of photons will then diverge for @xmath79 and the system becomes unstable for @xmath80 smaller than this limit .",
    "such instabilities are observed in photonic systems , for example in @xcite , when the chemical potential is large enough .",
    "since @xmath4 plays the role of a chemical potential in our system and as the number of excitations is not conserved , it is reasonable to find such a stability limit .",
    "we used our qmc simulations to study the divergence of the number of photons as the instability point is approached , fig .",
    "[ nphoton ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath81 follows the simple mf result for the larger values of the photon density , which is expected since our approximation is not valid for small densities .",
    "it is very difficult numerically to get closer to the divergence point because the qmc becomes inefficient when there is a very large number of photons on a site ( typically more than ten or twenty photons per site ) .",
    "however , there is always a region where the mf behaviour is observed which confirms that the system is unstable below a given value of @xmath4 ( @xmath82 in the case of fig .",
    "[ nphoton ] ) .",
    ", predicted with a simple mean field theory when @xmath83 and the qmc data .",
    "we find very good agreement for intermediate densities . at larger densities ,",
    "the qmc becomes inefficient .",

    "[ nphoton],width=332 ]    as mentioned above , the finite size scaling analysis we performed for different values of @xmath3 , allows us to determine the phase diagram in the @xmath84 plane which we show in fig .",
    "[ diag ] .",
    "the mf results obtained in @xcite provide a qualitatively correct description of the transition line throughout the phase diagram .",
    "on the other hand , the simple ansatz eq.([gcsimple ] ) only works well for large @xmath23 .     and",
    "there is an unstable region for @xmath86 .",
    "the rest of the diagram is separated between a coherent (  superradiant \" ) region and incoherent (  insulating \" ) one .",

    "we find a qualitatively similar phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ diagjr ] .",
    "this demonstrates that , when the counter - rotating term is large enough , be it in the hopping or the exchange terms , the mott insulating phases are suppressed .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the cr terms couple states with different numbers of excitations and , consequently , forbid the photon blockade @xcite which is needed for the mott phases to form @xcite .",
    ", @xmath90 and @xmath91 is very similar to fig .",
    "the continuous mf transition line was obtained with the same technique as in @xcite . whenever we have counter - rotating terms that are large enough , whether in the hopping term or in the exchange term between the spins and photons , we recover qualitatively the same diagram with only two phases ( incoherent and coherent ) and no mott phases .",
    "error bars are smaller than symbols .",

    "in the preceding section , we focused on the case with zero detuning , and found that the cr terms played a major role in the physics of our system and could not be neglected .",

    "we will now study cases where the detuning , @xmath93 , is non zero or where @xmath94 is smaller than @xmath95 to see if cr terms play an important part in these cases too . to simplify our study",

    "we will use the mf approximation that was used in @xcite , as it provides qualitatively correct results , as well as qmc .",

    "and we tune @xmath4 , setting @xmath103 .",
    "the notion of canonical or grand canonical ensemble is not really pertinent for the rh model as the number of excitations is not a conserved quantity . as mentioned before , the models have very different phase diagrams . if we introduce positive detuning , @xmath104 , that is if @xmath105 , we favor photon over spin excitations and this leads to similar differences between the two models as we encountered for @xmath43 .",
    "however , if we introduce negative detuning @xmath106 , the physics of the two models becomes equivalent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagd0 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this is because @xmath107 favors atom excitations over photon creations and , then , reduces the possible fluctuations of the total number of excitations . in both models ,",

    "as @xmath110 becomes larger ( but always negative ) , the two phase diagrams become more similar as the mi phases with @xmath111 in the jch model disappear and as the shape of the @xmath108 mi phase becomes more similar between the two models ( fig .",

    "<S> we study , using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations , the ground state properties of a one dimensional rabi - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of a lattice of rabi systems coupled by a photon hopping term between near neighbor sites . for large enough coupling between photons and atoms , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram generally consists of only two phases : a coherent phase and a compressible incoherent one separated by a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , as one goes deeper in the coherent phase , the system becomes unstable exhibiting a divergence of the number of photons . </S>",
    "<S> the mott phases which are present in the jaynes - cummings - hubbard model are not observed in these cases due to the presence of non - negligible counter - rotating terms . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these two models become equivalent only when the detuning is negative and large enough , or if the counter - rotating terms are small enough . </S>"
