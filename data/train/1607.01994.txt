    "in this paper we present a self - contained study of hilbert  sobolev spaces defined on arbitrary open and closed sets of @xmath0 , aimed at applied and numerical analysts interested in linear elliptic problems on rough domains , in particular in boundary integral equation ( bie ) reformulations .",
    "our focus is on the sobolev spaces @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , all described below , where @xmath6 ( respectively @xmath7 ) is an arbitrary open ( respectively closed ) subset of @xmath0 .",
    "our goal is to investigate properties of these spaces ( in particular , to provide natural unitary realisations for their dual spaces ) , and to clarify the nature of the relationships between them .",
    "our motivation for writing this paper is recent and current work by two of the authors @xcite on problems of acoustic scattering by planar screens with rough ( e.g.  fractal ) boundaries .",
    "the practical importance of such scattering problems has been highlighted by the recent emergence of `` fractal antennas '' in electrical engineering applications , which have attracted attention due to their miniaturisation and multi - band properties ; see the reviews @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the acoustic case considered in @xcite and the results of the current paper may be viewed as first steps towards developing a mathematical analysis of problems for such structures . in the course of our investigations of bies on more general sets it appeared to us that the literature on the relevant classical sobolev spaces , while undeniably vast , is not as complete or as clear as desirable in the case when the domain of the functions is an arbitrary open or closed subset of euclidean space , as opposed to the very well - studied case of a lipschitz open set . by ",
    "classical sobolev spaces \" we mean the simplest of sobolev spaces , hilbert spaces based on the @xmath8 norm , which are sufficient for a very large part of the study of linear elliptic bvps and bies , and are for this reason the focus of attention for example in the classic monographs @xcite and @xcite and in the more recent book by mclean @xcite that has become the standard reference for the theory of bie formulations of bvps for strongly elliptic systems .",
    "however , even in this restricted setting there are many different ways to define sobolev spaces on subsets of @xmath0 ( via e.g.  weak derivatives , fourier transforms and bessel potentials , completions of spaces of smooth functions , duality , interpolation , traces , quotients , restriction of functions defined on a larger subset ,   ) . on lipschitz open sets ( defined e.g.  as in @xcite ) , many of these different definitions lead to the same sobolev spaces and to equivalent norms .",
    "but , as we shall see , the situation is more complicated for spaces defined on more general subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "of course there already exists a substantial literature relating to function spaces on rough subsets of @xmath0 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however , many of the results presented here , despite being relatively elementary , do appear to be new and of interest and relevance for applications",
    ". that we are able to achieve some novelty may be due in part to the fact that we restrict our attention to the hilbert ",
    "sobolev framework , which means that many of the results we are interested in can be proved using hilbert space techniques and geometrical properties of the domains , without the need for more general and intricate theories such as those of besov and triebel  lizorkin spaces and atomic decompositions @xcite which are usually employed to describe function spaces on rough sets .",
    "this paper is by no means an exhaustive study , but we hope that the results we provide , along with the open questions that we pose , will stimulate further research in this area .",
    "many of our results involve the question of whether or not a given subset of euclidean space can support a sobolev distribution of a given regularity ( the question of `` @xmath9-nullity '' , see  [ subsec : polarity ] below ) .",
    "a number of results pertaining to this question have been derived recently in @xcite using standard results from potential theory in @xcite , and those we shall make use of are summarised in  [ subsec : polarity ] .",
    "we will also make reference to a number of the concrete examples and counterexamples provided in @xcite , in order to demonstrate the sharpness ( or otherwise ) of our theoretical results .",
    "since our motivation for this work relates to the question of determining the correct function space setting in which to analyse integral equations posed on rough domains , we include towards the end of the paper an application to bies on fractal screens ; further applications in this direction can be found in @xcite .",
    "we point out that one standard way of defining sobolev spaces not considered in detail in this paper is interpolation ( e.g.  defining spaces of fractional order by interpolation between spaces of integer order , as for the famous lions  magenes space @xmath10 ) . in our separate paper",
    "@xcite we prove that while the spaces @xmath1 and @xmath3 form interpolation scales for lipschitz @xmath6 , if this regularity assumption is dropped the interpolation property does not hold in general ( this finding contradicts an incorrect claim to the contrary in @xcite ) .",
    "this makes interpolation a somewhat unstable operation on non - lipschitz open sets , and for this reason we do not pursue interpolation in the current paper as a means of defining sobolev spaces on such sets .",
    "however , for completeness we collect in remark  [ rem : lionsmagenes ] some basic facts concerning the space @xmath11 on lipschitz open sets , derived from the results presented in the current paper and in @xcite .      in light of the considerable variation in notation within the sobolev space literature , we begin by clarifying the notation and the basic definitions we use . for any subset @xmath12",
    "we denote the complement of @xmath13 by @xmath14 , the closure of @xmath13 by @xmath15 , and the interior of @xmath13 by @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the hausdorff dimension of @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , and by @xmath18 the @xmath19-dimensional lebesgue measure of @xmath13 ( for measurable @xmath13 ) . throughout the paper ,",
    "@xmath6 will denote a non - empty open subset of @xmath0 , and @xmath7 a non - empty closed subset of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath6 is @xmath20 ( respectively @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively lipschitz ) if its boundary @xmath23 can be locally represented as the graph ( suitably rotated ) of a @xmath20 ( respectively @xmath21 , respectively lipschitz ) function from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , with @xmath6 lying only on one side of @xmath23 .",
    "for a more detailed definition see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 1.2.1.1 ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath26 there is no distinction between these definitions : we interpret them all to mean that @xmath6 is a countable union of open intervals whose closures are disjoint .",
    "note that in the literature several alternative definitions of lipschitz open sets can be found ( see e.g.  the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the following definitions are stronger than that given above : stein s `` minimally smooth domains '' in @xcite , which require all the local parametrisations of the boundary to have the same lipschitz constant and satisfy a certain finite overlap condition ; adams `` strong local lipschitz property '' in @xcite ; neas lipschitz boundaries @xcite ; and definition  3.28 in @xcite , which is the most restrictive of this list as it considers only sets with bounded boundaries for which sets it is equivalent to the `` uniform cone condition '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.2.2.2 ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , definition  1.2.1.2 in @xcite ( `` lipschitz manifold with boundary '' ) is weaker than ours ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.2.1.5 ) .      for @xmath27 , the fundamental hilbert ",
    "sobolev spaces on an open set @xmath28 are usually defined either    1 .   intrinsically , using volume integrals over @xmath6 of squared weak ( distributional ) derivatives for @xmath29 , slobodeckij  gagliardo integral norms for @xmath30 , and by duality for @xmath31 ( cf .",

    "@xcite ) .    following mclean @xcite , we denote by @xmath33 the former class of spaces and by @xmath1 the latter . clearly @xmath34 for @xmath35",
    "; in fact the two classes of spaces coincide and their norms are equivalent whenever there exists a continuous extension operator @xmath36 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.18 ) ; this exists ( at least for @xmath35 ) for lipschitz @xmath6 with bounded boundary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  a.4 ) , and more generally for `` minimally smooth domains '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , theorem  5 ) and `` @xmath37 locally uniform domains '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  5 and theorem  8) .",
    "but it is easy to find examples where the two spaces are different : if @xmath6 is lipschitz and bounded , and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a hyperplane that divides @xmath6 into two components , then @xmath40 for @xmath41 as their elements require a continuous extension to @xmath0 , while the elements of @xmath42 can jump across @xmath39 , so @xmath43 .",
    "in the present paper we will only investigate the spaces @xmath1 and certain closed subspaces of @xmath32 related to @xmath6 , i.e.  we choose option _ ( ii ) _ above .",
    "we cite two main reasons motivating this choice ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "firstly , while the intrinsic spaces @xmath33 described in option _ ( i ) _ are the standard setting for bvps posed in an open set @xmath6 and their finite element - type discretisations , the extrinsic spaces @xmath1 and certain closed subspaces of @xmath32 arise naturally in bie formulations .",
    "an example ( for details see  [ sec : bie ] and @xcite ) is the scattering of an acoustic wave propagating in @xmath44 ( @xmath26 or @xmath45 ) by a thin screen , assumed to occupy a bounded relatively open subset of the hyperplane @xmath46 . identifying this hyperplane with @xmath0 and the screen with an open subset @xmath47 in the obvious way",
    ", one can impose either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions on the screen by first taking a ( trivial ) dirichlet or neumann trace onto the hyperplane @xmath0 , then prescribing the value of the restriction of this trace to @xmath48 , as an element of @xmath49 or @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the solution to the associated bie is respectively either the jump in the normal derivative of the acoustic field or the jump in the field itself across the hyperplane , these jumps naturally lying in the closed subspaces @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively ( see below for definitions ) .",
    "secondly , on non - lipschitz open sets @xmath6 the intrinsic spaces @xmath33 present a number of undesirable properties .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 the embedding @xmath54 may fail and the embedding @xmath55 may be non - compact ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other pathological behaviours are described in  1.1.4 of @xcite : for @xmath56 ,",
    "the three spaces defined by the ( squared ) norms @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 may be all different from each other .      in pde applications , one often wants to work with sobolev spaces on an open set @xmath6 which have `` zero trace '' on the boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "there are many different ways to define such spaces ; in this paper we consider the following definitions , which are equivalent only under certain conditions on @xmath6 and @xmath9 ( as will be discussed in  [ subsec:3spaces ] ) :    * @xmath2 , the closure in @xmath1 of the space of smooth , compactly supported functions on @xmath6 .",
    "* @xmath3 , the closure in @xmath32 of the space of smooth , compactly supported functions on @xmath6 .",
    "* @xmath60 , the set of those distributions in @xmath32 whose support lies in the closure @xmath61 .",
    "* @xmath4 , defined for @xmath62 as the set of those distributions in @xmath32 that are equal to zero almost everywhere in the complement of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath2 , being a closed subspace of @xmath1 , is a space of distributions on @xmath6 , while @xmath3 , @xmath60 and @xmath4 , all being closed subspaces of @xmath63 , are spaces of distributions on @xmath0 ( which can sometimes be embedded in @xmath1 or @xmath2 , as we will see ) .",
    "all the notation above is borrowed from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , except the notation @xmath4 which we introduce here ( essentially the same space is denoted @xmath64 in @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that for lipschitz or smoother open sets @xmath6 , the above spaces are classically characterised as kernels of suitable trace operators ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.40 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.5.1.5 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 , theorem  11.5 ) ) .",
    "trace spaces on closed sets @xmath65 with empty interior ( e.g.  finite unions of submanifolds of @xmath0 , or fractals such as cantor sets ) are sometimes defined as quotient spaces , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",

    "while we do not discuss such trace operators or trace spaces in this paper , we point out that our results in  [ subsec : diffdoms ] and  [ subsec : hs0vshs ] , respectively , describe precisely when the latter two trace spaces are or are not trivial .",
