    "the radiation is produced in these systems as a result of magnetic field dissipation ( referred to as _ reconnection _ , a generic phrase , which we will be using throughout this article ) , where particles are accelerated either via parallel electric field or first order fermi process in converging flows , and they then emit photons via the synchrotron process .",
    "radiation could also be produced in shocks internal to the jet or when the jet interacts with the surrounding medium via a shock and transfers a fraction of its energy to particles in the external medium we do not consider the latter process in this paper .",
    "magnetic reconnection is a complex and poorly understood process despite the work of numerous people on this problem for the last more than 50 years , e.g. dungey ( 1953 ) , sweet ( 1958 ) , parker ( 1957 ) , petschek ( 1964 ) , syrovatskii ( 1981 ) , biskamp ( 1986 ) , yamada et al .",

    "does this mean that we are doomed in our effort to understand those astrophysical systems where poynting jets play an important role until a predictive theory for reconnections is developed ?",
    "the answer depends on what it is that we want to understand about these systems .",
    "if we are interested in the general , global , properties then the fine details of the reconnection process might not matter .",
    "a basic understanding can be obtained from certain lorentz invariant functions of electromagnetic tensor and conservation laws .",
    "the goal of this paper is thus modest , and highly restricted in this sense , i.e. to try to provide some constraints on poynting jet parameters ( without having to rely on a particular reconnection model ) so that magnetic dissipation can explain some broad aspects of the data such as the efficiency for converting magnetic energy to radiation and the general shape of the emergent spectrum . in a recent paper beniamini & piran ( 2014 )",
    "have provided constraints on a poynting jet model for grbs .",
    "their general approach and results are very different from the one we pursue here .    in section 2",
    "we provide a few general properties of poynting jet .",
    "we estimate the maximum energy electrons could achieve in reconnection , and the shape of emergent spectrum also in  2 .",
    "figure [ current - sheets ] provides a schematic sketch of the system we are considering . the magnetic fields of a relativistic poynting jet undergo dissipation at some radius to @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "we are considering the maximum size of the region that is in causal contact at @xmath2 , i.e. between @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "if this does not capture a good fraction of the energy dissipation process then we can add up results from other radii in a trivial way as processes going on in one region have no effect on another region that is not in causal contact . ] @xmath5 and a number of current sheets form within the causally connected region of the jet of comoving size @xmath6 ( @xmath7 in lab frame ) and efficiently convert the magnetic energy to particle energy and radiation . within any current sheet",
    "there are likely to be a number of different regions where particles are accelerated , and within a space of size @xmath6 there are obviously many more .",
    "these acceleration regions are usually associated with x - points  located in between plasmoids or magnetic islands that form due to tearing instability  where the magnetic field vanishes in absence of a guide field and where the electric field can accelerate particles , or with converging flows where particle acceleration takes place via first order fermi process .",
    "regions where particles are accelerated will be referred to as pass ( particle acceleration sites ) .",
    "some general considerations regarding particle acceleration in an individual pas is discussed in  [ particle - acc ] . the maximum lorentz factor ( lf ) of particles in pass",
    "is determined by a combination of electric field strength and radiative losses in addition to energy conservation (  [ particle - acc ] ) .",
    "while outside pass , particles lose energy to radiation and any acceleration they experience is negligible . the particle distribution function inside pass is not determined in this paper and is taken to be a hard powerlaw function as per numerical simulations ( zenitani & hoshino 2001 ; jaroschek et al .",
    "2004 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2011 , 2014 ; guo et al .",

    "[ number - cs ] we provide an estimate for distance from the center where poynting jet is likely dissipated and the number of current sheets in the causally connected region for an efficient conversion of magnetic energy to radiation .",
    "let us consider a poynting jet with magnetization parameter @xmath8 , lorentz factor ( lf ) @xmath9 , and isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath10 .",
    "the dissipation of magnetic field takes place when the jet is at radius r , and that is also roughly the radius where radiation is produced .",
    "the plasma is sufficiently cold before magnetic reconnections so that the thermal pressure of particles can be ignored .",
    "the magnetic field in the jet comoving frame is @xmath11  all physical quantities in the jet comoving frame are denoted by a prime and observer frame variables are un - primed  which is related to jet luminosity as @xmath12 provided that @xmath13 ; we are using the convenient notation @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt the standard model that charged particles are accelerated in reconnection layers where magnetic field dissipation takes place .",
    "the accelerated electrons with `` thermal '' lf @xmath15 emit synchrotron photons of frequency less than or equal to @xmath16 ( in the observer frame ) which is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are electron charge and mass , and @xmath20 is the redshift of the object . an upper limit to @xmath15 can be obtained from energy conservation , i.e. the energy in accelerated particles can not exceed the energy in magnetic field .",
    "this condition gives @xmath21 where @xmath22 is electron number density in the jet comoving frame , and @xmath23 is jet magnetization parameter .",
    "the reason that equation ( [ gam - absolute - max ] ) gives the maximum electron lf and not the average lf is because electrons accelerated in current sheets have a power - law distribution function ( @xmath24 ) with @xmath25 , and therefore most of the electron `` thermal '' energy is carried by the highest energy electrons ; numerical simulations find @xmath25 when the region where the reconnection takes place is strongly magnetized , @xmath26 a few , and when the reconnection layer is sufficiently large in size ( e.g. romanova & lovelace 1992 ; zenitani & hoshino 2001 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2014 ; bessho & bhattacharjee 2012 , werner et al .",

    "we can calculate the number of electrons needed to produce a given observed flux by combining equations ( [ b - jet])([syn - flux ] ) : @xmath35    the optical depth of these electrons to thomson scattering is , @xmath36 and their `` thermal '' lf and kinetic energy luminosity they carry are @xmath37^{1/2 } = 4\\times10 ^ 3 { [ r_{15 } \\nu_{kev}(1+z)]^{1/2 }          \\over l_{48}^{1/4}},\\ ] ]    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is photon frequency ( in units of 1 kev ) for which the observed specific flux is @xmath40 .",
    "considering that the energy carried by electrons can not exceed the energy in magnetic fields for a poynting jet , we find @xmath41 the reason for the approximate inequality sign in the above equation is because magnetic fields of a poynting jet could be compressed by a factor a few and thus @xmath42 could in principle exceed @xmath10 by order unity .",
    "if we consider that there are @xmath43 protons for every electron when only a fraction of electrons in the jet are accelerated . ]",
    "that radiates at frequency @xmath16 , then the kinetic energy luminosity carried by cold protons is @xmath44 therefore , the magnetization parameter for the jet at location where jet magnetic energy is dissipated and radiation is produced is given by @xmath45 if 10% of electrons in the jet are accelerated .",
    "i.e. @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 . and",
    "that means that the magnetization parameter at the let launching site where @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "consider an electron undergoing acceleration in a reconnection region where the electric field is @xmath51 , and the magnetic field is @xmath52 . in the absence of a guide field",
    ", the magnetic field vanishes at the x - point , and far away from it its magnitude is @xmath53 , but otherwise at this stage we place no further constraint on the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the electron starting from some place in the vicinity of the x - point is accelerated , and as it moves away it finds the strength of the magnetic field increasing . at some point when the magnetic field becomes sufficiently strong , which will be quantified shortly , the acceleration ceases if @xmath54 .",
    "however , even well before this happens , the electron could stop accelerating due to radiative losses which will determine its terminal lorentz factor .",
    "we consider this interplay between acceleration and radiative losses to determine maximum electron lf .",
    "it is best to view the motion of a particle acted upon by @xmath51 and @xmath52 from a frame where the fields point in the same direction ( which is always possible except when @xmath55 and the two fields are exactly perpendicular to each other ) .",
    "this special frame where @xmath56 will be referred to as the af frame ( aligned fields frame ) .",
    "there are two quadratic lorentz invariant functions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the electromagnetic tensor ( anti - symmetric 2-form ) . since @xmath59 is lorentz invariant , if there is a non - zero component of magnetic field in the direction of the electric field in one inertial frame , there will be a non - zero component in all inertial frames .",
    "however , the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field can be made to vanish by frame transformation if @xmath60 , or the electric field perpendicular to magnetic field can be transformed away in an appropriate frame when @xmath61 .",
    "the point is that there exists an inertial frame ( af ) where the transformed electric and magnetic fields are parallel , and the motion of the electron is the af frame is as simple as can be  the electron momentum parallel to the fields increases linearly with time ( if the electric field is non - zero in this frame ) , and the perpendicular component of momentum has a constant magnitude ( time independent ) and it rotates about the magnetic field at a constant rate .",
    "the simplest way to get to the af frame is by a lorentz boost in the direction @xmath62 ; if @xmath63 , then obviously no lorentz transformation is needed as we are already in a frame where the two fields are either parallel or one of them is zero .",
    "a straightforward lorentz transformation algebra shows that the speed of the lorentz boost required so that the fields are parallel in the new frame is @xmath64^{1/2 } \\over 2\\epsilon \\sin\\theta ' }      \\label{beta - lt}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 figure [ lt - gam ] shows the lf of needed boost as a function of @xmath66 for a few different values of @xmath67 ; a simple analytical expression for @xmath68 and @xmath69 is @xmath70 which turns out to be exact ( as opposed to approximate ) for all values of @xmath66 for the special case of @xmath71 .",
    "the electric field in the new frame follows from the two lorentz invariant quantities mentioned above and is given by @xmath72 and the magnetic field is @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are defined in equation ( [ lorentz - inv ] ) .",
    "the angle between the aligned electro - magnetic field in the af frame and the electric field in the jet frame can be easily calculated and is @xmath76 the lower panel of figure [ lt - gam ] shows @xmath77 as a function of @xmath66 for a few different values of @xmath67 .    with these results in hand , we are ready to describe particle acceleration in a current sheet . consider a charged particle in the vicinity of the x - point where @xmath78 .",
    "we can transform away the perpendicular component of the magnetic field by going to the af frame , and in this frame the particle lorentz factor @xmath79 ( the double prime emphasizes that we are in a different inertial frame , and not the jet comoving frame ) increases as @xmath80 , which can be rewritten from the point of view of the jet frame as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the distance the electron has traveled along the direction of the electric field from its starting position in the jet comoving frame , and @xmath83    as the electron travels further and further away from the x - point , it feels the strength of the magnetic field increase and at some point when @xmath84 becomes stronger than @xmath85 the electron is no longer accelerated ( unless @xmath86 ) and its momentum vector gyrates about the magnetic field and the lf oscillations and drifts slowly with time .",
    "this generic behavior can been in figure ( [ particle - lf ] ) where numerical result for particle motion in a current sheet is presented .",
    "if the length of the region where @xmath87 is @xmath88 , then the maximum lf of electron @xmath89 ; it should be noted that @xmath90 for a magnetic field configuration where @xmath84 increases linearly with distance from the x - point , and thus @xmath91 ( see e.g. larrabee et al , 2003 ) . however , two effects can substantially limit electron lf below this value .",
    "one of which is _  global _  energy conservation , which provides a limit for @xmath92 as described by equation ( [ gam - absolute - max ] ) . and the other is radiative losses  synchrotron and inverse - compton ( ic ) for systems of interest to us",
    " that could restrict particle lf further .",
    "this is discussed below .    viewed from the af frame where @xmath93 , the electron suffers radiative losses due to acceleration along the electric field direction , gyration about the magnetic field , and inverse - compton scatterings .",
    "we evaluate each of these to determine the dominant loss mechanism , and its effect on @xmath92 .",
    "the energy loss rate is calculated by first assuming that the magnetic field lines are parallel , i.e. @xmath94 , and the electric field is nearly uniform .",
    "this estimate is then improved by relaxing these assumptions and by considering the more realistic possibility that magnetic field lines have non - zero curvature , and that the electric field has spacial fluctuations in the acceleration region .",
    "the power radiated due to particle acceleration along the electric field can be calculated using the larmor s formula .",
    "the momentum vector of the electron in the af frame is nearly parallel to @xmath95 since it is being accelerated along the electric field and the magnetic field is parallel to @xmath95 in this frame .",
    "therefore , the electric field in the instantaneous rest - frame of electron is also @xmath95 , and the magnitude of its acceleration in this frame is @xmath96 .",
    "it then follows from larmor s formula that the power radiated ( which is a lorentz invariant quantity ) is @xmath97 ; from equation ( [ beta - lt ] ) and fig .",
    "[ lt - gam ] we know that @xmath98 for @xmath99 , and hence @xmath100 .",
    "this rate of loss of energy is independent of electron lf , and so the maximum electron lf in this case is bounded only by the size of the acceleration region .    the synchrotron loss rate due to electron gyration about the magnetic field is @xmath101 ; where @xmath102 is the 4-momentum of the electron perpendicular to the magnetic field . in the region where particles are undergoing acceleration , the magnetic field in the af frame ( @xmath103 ) either vanishes ( if @xmath54 ) or is parallel to @xmath51 , and in either case the value of @xmath104 does not change with time even as the electron continues to accelerate .",
    "thus , the synchrotron loss rate ( like the loss rate due to acceleration along the electric field ) is nearly independent of electron momentum , which continues to increase linearly with time along @xmath51 while the electron is in the acceleration region .    for realistic astrophysical systems we do nt expect the magnetic and electric field lines to be perfectly straight in the acceleration region .",
    "the curvature of field lines and the variation of @xmath105 with distance from the x - point causes the direction of @xmath95 to change ( see fig .",
    "[ lt - gam ] for the dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath105 ) , and therefore particle momentum vector is also rotated . due to these effects @xmath106",
    "is no longer independent of time , and in fact even a modest curvature in @xmath51 would lead to @xmath107 . in this case",
    "the synchrotron loss estimated above increases by a factor @xmath108 ( the loss due to acceleration along @xmath51 increases by a similar factor ) and is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the strength of the guide field . from here on we assume that the guide field is not much smaller than @xmath11 and therefore particle acceleration is dominated by electric field parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the inverse - compton loss rate is proportional to the energy density of photons , which is closely related to magnetic field dissipation .",
    "photons are produced via the synchrotron process in acceleration regions and also outside it .",
    "assuming that a fraction @xmath111 of magnetic field energy in a causally connected region of size @xmath6 is dissipated in a dynamical time and converted to radiation , the photon energy density in the comoving jet frame is in the comoving frame travel a distance in a dynamical time which is also @xmath6 , and hence all the radiative energy is confined to a volume @xmath112 . ]",
    "@xmath113 , and therefore the ic loss rate is @xmath114    equating the rate of energy gain for an electron as it is accelerated along the electric field with the rate of radiative loses we arrive at the following equation for the maximum value for lf @xmath115 or @xmath116 where we made use of equation ( [ b - jet ] ) to substitute for @xmath53 , and we are considering the case where @xmath117 . the maximum electron lf is the smaller of values given in equations ( [ gam - absolute - max ] ) and ( [ gam - max ] ) .",
    "the distance an electron travels to get accelerated to @xmath118 is @xmath119 the synchrotron photon energy corresponding to @xmath92 is @xmath120    the minimum electron lf can be obtained by taking the length of the acceleration region to be no less than proton larmor radius .",
    "this gives @xmath121 .",
    "simulations of particle acceleration in a reconnection layer show that the energy distribution is a hard powerlaw function below @xmath92 and exponentially cut - off above it , i.e. @xmath122 , for @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "when we add up particle distribution functions in all pass within the causally connected region of the jet at the radius where a good fraction of magnetic energy in the jet is dissipated , the resulting distribution is @xmath125 the value of @xmath126 depends on how many electrons pass through pass which can accelerate them to lf @xmath15 ; if the number of pass increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath92 then @xmath127 .",

    "the distribution above @xmath130 also falls off more rapidly than @xmath131 .",
    "let us assume that electrons spend an average of @xmath132 time in an acceleration region which is larger than @xmath133 ; the average is taken over all particle acceleration sites or pass in causally connected part of the jet .",
    "furthermore , the total number of electrons injected into these acceleration regions , in the causally connected part of the jet , per unit time is @xmath134 . the average rate at which particles exit pass should also be @xmath134 .",
    "particles outside pass cool down radiatively and therefore the particle distribution outside is much steeper .",
    "we calculate this distribution , and estimate the synchrotron flux from electrons inside and outside pass .",
    "if the average time spent by electrons outside pass is @xmath135 , then in that time electrons cool down to lf @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the ratio of dynamical time in jet comoving frame and @xmath135 .",
    "the electron distribution outside pass is obtained by solving @xmath138 where the source function is @xmath139 @xmath140 , @xmath134 is the rate at which electrons with lorentz factors @xmath141 leave acceleration regions and enter the surrounding medium , and @xmath142 a quasi - steady state solution is reasonable to consider when the time it takes for a typical pas in the jet to form and disappears is much shorter than the dynamical time , and there are many pass in the causally connected region of the jet that contribute to particle acceleration and radiation ; the average of all these pass can be taken to be roughly constant for about a dynamical time .",

[ gam - max ] ) and @xmath148 ( eq . [ gam - c ] ) .",
    "the distribution is effectively cutoff above @xmath130 outside the pass since electrons of this high energy cool efficiently and their lf drops below @xmath130 quickly .",

    "however , a steep drop off of the distribution function just below @xmath157 is physical .",

    "the spectrum for the magnetic model on the other hand has just one peak , and therefore in principle it can be distinguished from the ssc model .",
    "however , in practice , the first peak for the ssc model may be at a frequency that is below the observing band , and that would make the task of identifying a poynting jet more difficult .",
    "there are examples of low energy spectral softening in astrophysical objects , e.g. , grb 090926a ( ackermann et al .",
    "2011 ) , but it is difficult to say whether or not it is due to multiple components to the spectrum or from the spectral feature described in this paper .",
    "we looked for the spectral feature we predict for a magnetic reconnection model in solar flares where magnetic dissipation is widely believed be at work ( e.g. lin et .",
    "al , 2003 ) . unfortunately",
    ", solar flares have a large thermal component , so the presence of a soft spectral feature at low frequencies is difficult to discern in these transients .",
    "the ratio of the luminosity in synchrotron and ic radiations is equal to the ratio of energy densities in magnetic field and photons . since only a small fraction of energy in magnetic fields in dissipated in current sheets",
    ", it is expected that the ic luminosity of a poynting jet would be smaller than the synchrotron luminosity .",
    "the ic spectrum , or to be precise synchrotron - self - compton spectrum , is straightforward to calculate using the results for particle distribution and synchrotron spectrum described above .",
    "the radius interval where conversion of magnetic energy to thermal energy for a poynting jet takes place depends on the magnetic field configuration and instabilities that develop in the jet .",
    "these are very difficult to calculate with any confidence .",
    "however , some general considerations described in this subsection provide broad guidance which can be used to constrain the dissipation radius and the number of current sheets in the jet .",
    "consider a short segment of the jet that was launched at radius @xmath185 .",
    "the dissipation of magnetic energy in this segment could take place anywhere between @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( the deceleration radius of the jet ) , either gradually over this long distance interval or suddenly within a short distance .",
    "once the reconnection gets started at one location in the jet , it could trigger magnetic field dissipation at other sites  possibly as a result of plasma outflow from this region or magnetic field reconfiguration propagating at alfven speed and triggering reconnection at other sites  and these _ secondary _ reconnection sites lie in a region of the jet that is in causal contact with the current sheet triggering these events .",
    "it is unlikely that most of the energy of this segment of the jet under consideration will be dissipated at a radius smaller than @xmath187 because of causality considerations ( provided of course that different parts of this segment of the jet do nt independently develop instability and/or reconnection centers ) .",
    "we can describe the dissipation with radius as a monotonically increasing function of radius , @xmath188 ; @xmath189 is the fraction of the magnetic energy in the segment that is dissipated or converted to bulk kinetic energy of the jet .    for reconnections in a jet consisting of stripped magnetic wind geometry ( magnetic fields reversing direction over distance of @xmath190 in the lab frame ) , @xmath191 ( e.g. drenkhahn and spruit , 2002 ; kumar & zhang , 2014 ) , and the process is completed at a radius @xmath192 ; where @xmath193 as defined in ",
    "[ particle - acc ] is the ratio of electric and magnetic fields and @xmath194 is the speed for plasma flow into current sheets .",
    "so , although , the magnetic field dissipation process in this case is slow and extends over a large distance interval of @xmath185  @xmath195 , roughly half of the magnetic energy is in fact dissipated within a factor of a few of @xmath196 .",
    "this follows from causality , i.e. the size of the region where magnetic field is dissipated can not increase at a speed faster than light , and hence the radial width of region where field has been dissipated grows proportional to @xmath6 ( in jet comoving frame ) and that is the reason that a good fraction of magnetic energy dissipation occurs within a factor a few of the terminal radius where the dissipation process is completed .",
    "this property is likely to be generic , and independent of magnetic field geometry and reconnection model .",
    "current sheets are likely to form and disappear on a time short compared with the dynamical time ( @xmath197 in jet comoving frame ) .",
    "we envision that there are an average @xmath198 pass present in the region at any given time , for a time duration @xmath199 , and the average length of these current sheets in jet comoving frame is @xmath200 .",
    "the total volume of plasma in the jet in the causally connected region at @xmath5 is @xmath201 provided that the jet opening angle is @xmath202 .",
    "since plasma flows into current sheets at speed @xmath203 , the total volume of plasma passing through current sheets in a dynamical time is @xmath204 if the fraction of the magnetic energy in the jet dissipated in this region is @xmath188 , then that means that the total volume of plasma passing through current sheets in volume @xmath205 should be @xmath206 .",
    "thus , we obtain the number of pass in the region to be @xmath207 \\left\\{r/(\\gamma\\ell'_s)\\right\\}^2 .",
    "\\label{n - sheet}\\ ] ]    a lower limit for @xmath198 can be obtained by substituting @xmath208 in equation ( [ n - sheet ] ) , which gives @xmath209 and a generous upper limit on the number of current sheets can be obtained by taking @xmath210 ( the distance an electron travels in order to get accelerated to lf @xmath92 ) . using ( [ la ] ) we find @xmath211 .",
    "this upper limit is much too large to be of practical use",
    ". the length of an acceleration region can be much larger than @xmath212 when electron acceleration is balanced by radiative losses , and in that case far fewer number of pass are needed to process magnetic energy to radiation .",
    "let us take @xmath213 , with @xmath214 that is needed to ensure that the observed radiation is dominated by electrons in pass ( as opposed to electrons in inter - pas regions ) and therefore the emergent spectrum is hard ( see  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "this results in @xmath215",
    "this work was motivated in part by a puzzle regarding gamma - ray bursts . a broad class of models for @xmath216-ray emission from grbs",
    "is based on the jet being baryonic , which moves with a lorentz factor @xmath217 .",
    "the kinetic energy of baryons in the jet is converted to particle thermal energy via a series of shocks , and radiated away via the synchrotron process . according to this model ,",
    "the spectrum below the peak should be @xmath218 or softer whereas the observed spectra for most bursts are close to @xmath219 , i.e. much harder than the baryonic jet model predicts ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    ", 2000 ; kumar & mcmahon , 2008 ) .",
    "the origin of this problem can be traced to the fact that particles are accelerated while crossing the shock front but otherwise they cool rapidly as they travel down - stream .",
    "therefore , the number of electrons increases rapidly with decreasing lf ( @xmath220 or faster ) and that is the reason for the soft spectrum for a generic model that is based on dissipation of baryonic jet energy in shocks .",
    "what we find is that if the grb jet were not baryonic but poynting , then the dissipation of magnetic fields and particle acceleration provides a way out this problem .",
    "this is because particles can be kept in acceleration regions for a time much longer than the their radiative cooling time , thereby preventing the development of a large population of lower energy electrons that give rise to a soft spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of radiation from electrons in the region in between pass ( where electrons are undergoing cooling without acceleration ) is soft like that it is for the shock model , but the spectrum emanating from pass is hard because the powerlaw index for the particle distribution function in current sheets has @xmath221 .",
    "we have shown in  [ spectra ] that the observed spectrum , which is a superposition of contributions from the two regions ( pass and inter - pass ) , is hard when the average time electrons spend in acceleration region is much larger than their synchrotron cooling time .",
    "one of the general results reported here may be able to determine whether a jet is baryonic or poynting  for a poynting jet , the spectrum below the peak softens with decreasing frequency , which is opposite to the case of a baryonic jet where shocks convert jet energy to radiation via the synchrotron process .",
    "pk would like to thank fan guo for useful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to sera markoff and an anonymous referee for offering numerous suggestions that significantly improved the paper ."
