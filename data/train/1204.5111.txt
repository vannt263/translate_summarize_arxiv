    "to what extent can the physics be reproduced quantitatively in the strong - coupling limit ?",

    "the elements @xmath121 of the matrices @xmath122 are considered as variational parameters which are locally and iteratively optimized during a sweep through the chain by exploiting the ritz variational principle .",
    "several sweeps are necessary to obtain a converged ground state .    in practice , the local optimization can be reformulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem which is simplified to an ordinary one by exploiting a local gauge invariance of @xmath117 to properly ( left- and right- ) orthogonalize the @xmath48-matrices .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is then efficiently solved by means of the davidson method .",
    "@xcite we profit from the so - called wave - function transformation @xcite to reduce the number of iterations necessary for convergence of the davidson algorithm and exploit the two @xmath123 symmetries of the hamiltonian corresponding to conservation of the total particle number and the @xmath112-component of the total spin .",

    "furthermore , while the susceptibility changes sign between nearest neighbors , its two - site _ average _ is negative between the adatoms and also beyond the first one for @xmath158 but is found to be positive for @xmath157 .",
    "there is another subtle observation , namely the ( ferromagnetic ) response at the nearest neighbor to the right of @xmath137 is larger than the one to the left of @xmath137 for all @xmath0 down to @xmath154 , except for @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",

    "a mean - field approach is inevitable anyway . here",
    "the conceptual simplicity of a single - site mean - field theory , as compared to different possibilities for cluster extensions , is important as it allows to study almost arbitrary geometries . as in ab - initio studies ,",
    "the accessible system size strongly depends on the remaining e.g.  lateral spatial symmetries , and the computational effort scales nearly linearly with the number of inequivalent correlated sites only .",
    "the two - impurity one - dimensional anderson model represents a model that is rather unfavorable to a single - site r - dmft approach . even for this case , as the present study has shown , r - dmft can in fact almost quantitatively predict the effects of indirect magnetic exchange in competition with the kondo and with geometrical effects  as long as the approximation predicts a fermi - liquid ground state .",

    "<S> to analyze the physical properties arising from indirect magnetic exchange between several magnetic adatoms and between complex magnetic nanostructures on metallic surfaces , the real - space extension of dynamical mean - field theory ( r - dmft ) appears attractive as it can be applied to systems of almost arbitrary geometry and complexity . </S>",
    "<S> while r - dmft describes the kondo effect of a single adatom exactly , indirect magnetic ( rkky ) exchange is taken into account on an approximate level only . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a simplified model system consisting of two magnetic hubbard sites ( `` adatoms '' ) hybridizing with a non - interacting tight - binding chain ( `` substrate surface '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this two - impurity anderson model incorporates the competition between the kondo effect and indirect exchange but is amenable to an exact numerical solution via the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) . the particle - hole symmetric model at half - filling and zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> is used to benchmark r - dmft results for the magnetic coupling between the two adatoms and for the magnetic properties induced in the substrate . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the local adatom and the nonlocal adatom - adatom static susceptibilities as well as the magnetic response of the substrate on the distance between the adatoms and on the strength of their coupling with the substrate is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we find both , excellent agreement with the dmrg data even on subtle details of the competition between rkky exchange and the kondo effect but also complete failure of the r - dmft , depending on the parameter regime considered . </S>",
    "<S> r - dmft calculations are performed using the lanczos method as impurity solver . with the real - space extension of the two - site dmft , we also benchmark a simplified r - dmft variant . </S>"
