    "the efficiency of a machine is a central , founding principle in thermodynamics .",
    "carnot realised that the impossibility of a perpetuum mobile ( of the second kind ) implies that the efficiency of a thermal machine is bounded from above and that this bound is universal , independent of the details in composition or construction of the engine @xcite .",
    "his key insight was that maximum efficiency is reached when operating in the immediate vicinity of an equilibrium point .",
    "a machine operating under this condition can function equally well as an engine and as a refrigerator .",
    "carnot s work eventually led clausius to introduce a new state function , the entropy , and to show that the upper bound of carnot was tantamount to the famous second law of thermodynamics , i.e. , the increase of the total entropy @xcite .    in the original clausius formulation of thermodynamics ,",
    "the entropy is well defined only for systems in equilibrium , and the second law refers to the increase of the total entropy of a closed system . through the work primarily of ilya prigogine ,",
    "it became clear that one can also define entropy in a state of local equilibrium @xcite .",
    "together with lars onsager , he lay the groundwork for linear irreversible thermodynamics , a theory that was further developed in detail for chemical and hydrodynamical systems @xcite .",
    "onsager provided as an additional ingredient , the symmetry of a properly defined response , or onsager matrix @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ( for variables that are even under time - reversal ) .",
    "the symmetry derives from the reversibility of the microscopic laws .",
    "as the off - diagonal elements of the onsager matrix describe , for a thermal engine , the machine and refrigerator functions , respectively , this symmetry extends the complementarity , noted by carnot , between these two modes of operations into the linear realm of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "although numerous examples of onsager symmetry have been documented @xcite , they are mostly limited to steady - state systems .",
    "most thermodynamic machines , on the other hand  in particular the carnot engine  operate under a time - periodic protocol . surprisingly , it is only recently @xcite that such systems have been discussed in the context of linear irreversible thermodynamics and that the corresponding onsager matrix and its symmetry properties have been uncovered .",
    "one significant novelty is that the onsager symmetry is generalized to the onsager - casimir relation @xmath2 , where the tilde stands for the matrix when operating under the time - inverse protocol .",
    "the breaking of the onsager symmetry seems to have a number of puzzling consequences , in particular concerning the efficiency at maximum power and efficiency at minimum dissipation , which have been clarified recently @xcite .     standard \" thermodynamics deals with macroscopic systems . since the very beginning",
    ", questions have been posed about its applicability to small - scale devices , with the maxwell demon the most notable illustration . over the past two decades",
    ", thermodynamics has been extended to describe small systems , including their thermal fluctuations .",
    "the most striking result is that the second law  the positivity of entropy production ",
    "is replaced by a symmetry property for the probability distribution of this quantity , which reproduces the positivity for the average as a subsidiary consequence .",
    "the implications on the fluctuating efficiency of a small - scale engine were elucidated more recently @xcite .",
    "one surprising conclusion is that the maximum efficiency , corresponding to a reversible operation , can occur by chance but is , for a time - symmetric operation , exponentially less likely than any other finite efficiency .",
    "the specific form of the probability distribution for the efficiency ( or , more precisely , its large deviation function ) is , in the regime of linear response , fully specified in terms of the onsager coefficients , providing a novel relation between fluctuation and dissipation .",
    "the connection between carnot efficiency and the second law puts a special emphasis on thermal machines .",
    "the second law , however , applies equally well to isothermal energy transformations , in which one form of  work \" is transformed into another form of  work . \"",
    "such transformations are actually ubiquitous in biological systems , for example the notable role of atp as energy converter in the cell @xcite . in this case , efficiency is defined as output over input work .",
    "maximum efficiency is again reached for a reversible operation and is equal to @xmath3 , expressing the thermodynamic possibility of a lossless work transformation .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explicitly test and illustrate , both theoretically and experimentally , the aforementioned crucial features of stochastic thermodynamics on an exactly solvable isothermal brownian engine , driven by a duo of time - periodic forces .",
    "in particular , we evaluate explicitly the onsager matrix , describing the dissipation and interaction of these two forces , verify the onsager - casimir relation , and check the newly discovered connection between different operational regimes of the engine ( maximum power , maximum efficiency , minimum dissipation ) . turning to the stochastic features , we verify the fluctuation theorem , evaluate the probability distribution of stochastic efficiency and the corresponding large deviation function , and check its signature features .",
    "last but not least , all these results are experimentally tested and reproduced without adjustable parameters on a colloidal system .",
    "we consider an open system in contact with one or several ( ideal ) reservoirs of heat , particles , or both , which can exchange work with one or several ( ideal ) work sources .",
    "the rate of change of its entropy has two contributions , an _ entropy flow _",
    "term @xmath4 , representing the exchange of entropy with the environment , and an _ entropy production _",
    "contribution @xmath5 , describing the internal irreversible processes : @xmath6 the second law requires that the entropy production be non - negative : @xmath7 furthermore , the entropy production can , at a steady state , typically be written as a bilinear sum over the constitutive irreversible processes @xcite : @xmath8    here , the @xmath9 s represent , for each process , the thermodynamic forces quantifying the applied nonequilibrium constraint , for example a gradient in chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath10 s represent the corresponding fluxes , for example a work or particle flow .",
    "the second law stipulates that , given a single constraint @xmath11 , flow and force have to be in the  same direction , \" @xmath12 ( for example , particles moving to lower chemical potential ) .",
    "but with _ two flows _ , one contribution to the entropy production can be negative , provided the overall entropy production is positive : @xmath13 has to be non - negative , but considering the constitutive processes @xmath14 one can have a  load \" @xmath15 if the  drive \" @xmath16 .",
    "this observation corresponds , in fact , to the defining principle of an engine . in the best - known example , the heat engine , a  downhill \" flow of heat produces work via an  uphill \" flow against the other ( e.g. , mechanical , chemical or electrical ) force .",
    "the principle , however , applies equally well to isothermal energy transformations , where one form of work is transformed into another form of work  a  work to work \" engine .    from the above discussion and from eq .   for the entropy production ,",
    "a natural alternative definition of a thermodynamic efficiency @xmath17 is @xmath18 the universal upper bound @xmath3 is reached for zero entropy production , i.e. , for a reversible operation .",
    "note that this equilibrium point is also the point of flux reversal ; i.e. , an infinitesimal change of the forces at this point can switch the direction of both fluxes , exchanging  drive \" and  load . \"",
    "the definition of efficiency is then modified to @xmath19 .    a further simplification arises by noting that in many cases  chemical reactions being a notable exception  the forces are effectively weak ( e.g. , weak gradients ) .",
    "since the fluxes vanish in the absence of the forces ( which corresponds to an equilibrium state ) , a taylor expansion to lowest order in the forces gives @xmath20      j_2 & = l_{21 } x_1+l_{2 2}x_2 \\ , .",
    "\\label{jdefs } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these , together with eqs .",
    " , form the core equations of linear irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the second law now stipulates that the quadratic form @xmath21 has to be non - negative , implying @xmath22    onsager discovered an important additional constraint on these coefficients @xcite .",
    "he showed that , for properly defined fluxes and forces ( and variables that are even under time reversal ) , the matrix of the onsager coefficients @xmath23 also has to be symmetric , with @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , microscopic reversibility implies the onsager - casimir symmetry @xmath25 , where the tilde refers to inversion of the variables that are odd under time inversion @xcite ( for example , a velocity field @xcite or a magnetic field @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was realized that the onsager - casimir symmetry should also apply to variables that are _ even _ under time reversal but are driven periodically by a _ time - asymmetric _ force . @xcite .",
    "the latter situation is of great interest , as many engines operate in a time - asymmetric fashion .",
    "for example , the time - reverse of a carnot cycle no longer functions as an engine but rather as a refrigerator or heat pump !    concerning the operational conditions of an engine , one may obviously be interested in maximizing the output , @xmath26 , which is typically proportional to an output power and where @xmath27 is the temperature of the power - producing device .",
    "but one may also be interested in maximizing the efficiency @xmath17 or in minimizing the dissipation @xmath5 .",
    "the simplest way to perform such optimizations is to vary the load parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the optimization is , however , hampered by a trade - off between power and efficiency , which makes it impossible to optimize both features at the same time .",
    "in fact , within the linear approximation of eq .  , straightforward algebra implies that power and efficiency in both regimes are linked @xcite : @xmath29 where the subscripts mp and me refer to the engine operating under maximum power and maximum efficiency , respectively .",
    "this relation further splits into two separate conditions when the onsager symmetry is valid @xcite : @xmath30 furthermore , these two regimes can also be linked to the limit of minimal dissipation ( subscript md ) : @xmath31",
    "the above discussion refers to macroscopic systems , with no reference whatsoever to fluctuations . however , it turns out that a thermodynamic description that includes fluctuations away from a  thermodynamic limit \" leads to a much more profound and satisfying formulation of the second law .",
    "this should not , in retrospect , be a surprise as , from the very beginning , boltzmann himself stressed that the second law should be understood and interpreted in a statistical sense .",
    "we briefly review the salient features of this stochastic thermodynamics @xcite in the context of a gaussian approximation , which is relevant for the work to work engine introduced below .",
    "the first observation to make is that the quantities observed in an experiment will fluctuate from one run to another",
    ". we will denote such fluctuating quantities by the lower - case version of their macroscopic analogue ; for example , the fluctuating work delivered by the engine is represented by @xmath32 , the fluctuating flux by @xmath33 , etc .. the stochastic entropy production for an engine thus reads ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ ep1 ] ) :",
    "@xmath34 with @xmath35 note that the thermodynamic forces are supposed here to be imposed by macroscopic constraints and hence are not fluctuating .",
    "the second law is now replaced by a symmetry property , sometimes referred to as the fluctuation theorem .",
    "the quantities of interest are the sample averages of the two contributions to the entropy production , measured over a time @xmath36 : @xmath37    the fluctuation theorem ( in its simple asymptotic form ) imposes the following constraint : @xmath38 } \\,=           \\exp{\\left [ ( \\sigma_1+\\sigma_2)t / k_b \\right ] } \\ , .",

    "the @xmath40 sign refers to the fact that the relation is valid for asymptotically large times .",

    "combined with the assumed impossibility of a perpetuum mobile of the second kind , one can hence derive the famous inequalities , i.e. , that efficiencies must be smaller than the carnot efficiency and the  famous \" positivity of entropy production .    while this derivation is one of the most beautiful in science , its drawbacks and shortcomings raise several fundamental questions .",
    "as an example of a technical issue , how can an ideal gas stay at equilibrium while expanding adiabatically in the absence of a heat bath ?",
    "more fundamentally , the macroscopic limit , in which fluctuations are ignored , obscures the statistical nature of the second law and even conveys a belief  still broadly held  that the second law is a property of macroscopic systems alone .    following the footsteps of boltzmann",
    ", nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has partially bridged some of the gaps in the derivation and understanding of the second law .",
    "the basic connection between fluctuation and dissipation is core to the famous onsager symmetry , fluctuation - dissipation theorem , and green - kubo relations .",

    "furthermore , they often require a somewhat disturbing mix - up between the micro and macro worlds .",
    "for example , to connect with the world of equilibrium fluctuations , onsager assumes the regression hypothesis , stating that macroscopic disturbances regress on average in the same way as microscopic deviations caused by spontaneous fluctuations .",
    "conversely , the derivation of microscopic linear response  la green kubo has been justly criticized in its application to linear response for macroscopic laws @xcite .    the present work proceeds from and partially completes the work of einstein , langevin , and smoluchowski , by focusing on the statistical physics at the mesoscopic level of brownian particles .",
    "both underdamped and the overdamped description of brownian motion considered here have served well as an exemplar for nonequilibrium statistical physics . by introducing the duet of two periodic forces acting on a brownian particle , we connect with classic discussions of thermodynamic machines  .",
    "stochastic thermodynamics , with the second law replaced by a symmetry property for the probability distribution of the entropy production , provides the key ingredients to analyze this novel tale of efficiency .",
    "the intimate relation between fluctuation and dissipation is brought into full light , as all aspects of this engine , including the telltale properties of its fluctuating efficiency , can be expressed in terms of the ( linear response ) onsager coefficients .",
    "the brownian duet model has further advantages : it can be solved in full analytic detail .",
    "its experimental implementation , including the gathering of sufficient statistics and its possible technological applications , pose no special challenges . compared to the carnot - engine construction , it does miss the heat - to - work transformation , as well as some aspects of stochastic thermodynamics that have already been illustrated by a mesoscopic stirling engine involving a single brownian particle in a breathing harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "however , non - isothermal conditions are not natural in the brownian world  in the stirling - engine experiment , heating requires a strong laser pulse  nor , in fact , in most of the biological world . furthermore , applying stochastic thermodynamics to a heat - to - work transformation is more involved because of the non - gaussian distribution of heat fluctuations @xcite , rendering the theoretical analysis and interpretation of the engine and its efficiency much more complicated @xcite .    in any case , in this article",
    ", we have presented the first experimental observation of the dependence of the symmetry of onsager response coefficients on that of the driving force ; of the remarkable relations between power , efficiency , and dissipation that hold in the linear - response regime ; and of the maximum of the large deviation function at reversible efficiency , a prediction that is ultimately a consequence of microscopic reversibility .",
    "we also observe that the brownian duet can function in a  tease \" mode : when examined at short time intervals , it acts as a motor in the sense that a typical efficiency is positive , but when examined at longer time intervals , it acts as a dud .",
    "these tests illustrate the power of stochastic thermodynamics in extending a subject , developed in the 19th century to describe macroscopic heat engines , to the mesoscopic , fluctuating world that is so much the focus of science in the 21st century .",
