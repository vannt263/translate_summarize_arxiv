    "this may also provide an explanation why gravitaxis is only observed for particular microorganisms as , e.g. , _ chlamydomonas reinhardtii _ and why the gravitactic behavior is subjected to large variations within a single population @xcite .    in our experiments ,",
    "the particles had an almost homogeneous mass distribution in order to reveal pure shape - induced gravitaxis . for real biological systems",
    ", gravitaxis is a combination of the shape - induced mechanism studied here and bottom - heaviness resulting from an inhomogeneous mass distribution @xcite . in particular for eukaryotic cells , small mass inhomogeneities due to the nucleus or organella are rather likely .",
    "bottom - heaviness can straight - forwardly be included in our modeling by an additional torque contribution @xcite and would support negative gravitaxis . even for microorganisms with axial symmetry but fore - rear asymmetry @xcite like _ paramecium _ @xcite both the associated shape - dependent hydrodynamic friction and bottom - heaviness contribute to gravitaxis so that the particle shape matters also in this special case .    in conclusion ,",
    "our theory and experiments demonstrate that the presence of a gravitational field leads to straight downward and upward motion ( gravitaxis ) and also to trochoid - like trajectories of asymmetric self - propelled colloidal particles . based on a set of langevin equations",

    "<S> in particular , negative gravitaxis , i.e. , a swimming motion opposed to a gravitational force @xmath0 , is frequently observed for flagellates and ciliates such as _ chlamydomonas _ @xcite or _ paramecium _ @xcite . since this ability enables microorganisms to counteract sedimentation , gravitaxis extends the range of their habitat and allows them to optimize their position in environments with spatial gradients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in case of photosynthetic flagellates such as _ euglena gracilis _ , gravitaxis ( in addition to phototaxis ) contributes to their vertical motion in water which enables them to adjust the amount of exposure to solar radiation @xcite . in order to achieve a gravitactic motion , in general a stable orientation of the microorganism relative to the gravitational field </S>",
    "<S> is required . </S>",
    "<S> while in some organisms such alignment is likely to be dominated by an active physiological mechanism @xcite , its origin in other systems is still controversially discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that gravitaxis can also result from purely passive effects like , e.g. , an inhomogeneous mass density within the organism ( bottom - heaviness ) , which would lead to an alignment similar to that of a buoy in the ocean @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( we use the term `` gravitaxis '' , which is not uniformly defined in the literature , also in the context of passive alignment effects . ) under such conditions , the organism s alignment should be the same regardless whether it sediments downward or upward in a hypo- or hyper - density medium , respectively , as indeed observed for _ pluteus larvae _ @xcite . however , corresponding experiments with immobilized _ paramecium _ and _ gastrula larvae _ showed an alignment reversal for opposite sedimentation directions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests another mechanical alignment mechanism which is caused by the organism s fore - rear asymmetry @xcite .    to explore the role of shape asymmetry on the gravitactic behavior and to avoid the presence of additional physiological mechanisms , in our experiments we study the motion of colloidal micron - sized swimmers with asymmetric shapes in a gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> the self - propulsion mechanism is based on diffusiophoresis , where a local chemical gradient is induced in the solvent around the microswimmer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the corresponding type of motion is similar to that of biological microorganisms @xcite . based on our experimental and theoretical results , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a shape anisotropy alone is sufficient to induce gravitactic motion with either upward or downward swimming . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to straight trajectories also more complex swimming patterns are observed , where the swimmers perform a trochoid - like ( i.e. , a generalized cycloid - like @xcite ) motion transversal to the direction of gravity . </S>"
