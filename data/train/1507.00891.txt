    "over the last decade , great strides have been made in the development of free - electron lasers operating in the vuv - x - ray regime .",
    "several free - electron lasers operating in the xuv - x - ray regime have become available to the community in recent years : for example , flash @xcite , lcls @xcite , and sacla @xcite .",
    "these facilities have demonstrated their potential for opening new areas of atomic , molecular and optical physics , for example through the study of auger resonances which can not be excited by a single photon @xcite , multiphoton sequential ionization of xe up to xe@xmath7 at a photon energy of 1.5 kev @xcite and multiphoton multiple ionization of n@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "photoionization in high - frequency laser fields tends to be dominated by the innermost electron that can be ejected .",
    "however , the outer electrons will also experience the light field , and can therefore still absorb a photon . hence",
    ", a full description of the atomic or molecular response should consider all electrons that could possibly be affected by the laser field .",
    "in addition , outer electrons do not necessarily remain in their original orbital when an inner electron is removed from the system .",
    "the potential seen by the outer electrons may change suddenly , leading to shake - up excitation of the outer electrons .",
    "a full theoretical or computational study of the interaction between high - frequency laser light and atoms will therefore require a method which can describe the simultaneous response of many electrons to the laser field .",
    "several such methods have been developed in recent years , such as the time - dependent configuration - interaction singles ( tdcis ) method , which has recently been applied to study above - threshold ionization for light elements in the hard x - ray regime @xcite , a green s function technique , algebraic diagrammatic construction ( adc ) , which has been applied to study fast dynamics in glycine using laser pulses at a photon energy of 275 ev @xcite , and time - dependent r - matrix theory , which has been used to study the competition between emission of a 2s and a 2p electron in c in the uv regime @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we continue our study of the response of c atoms to laser light by investigating the photon energy range between 170 and 245 ev .",
    "the response of the carbon atom is of particular interest as it is the prime constituent of biological molecules .",
    "the removal of inner electrons from a carbon atom can provide new insight into molecular systems .",
    "for example , in @xcite , it was demonstrated that the removal of a 1s electron from the carbon atom in methane could be exploited experimentally to extract information about the molecular geometry . in @xcite , it was also proposed that dynamics in ionized glycine could be studied in a pump - probe scheme where the probe pulse excites a localised 1s electron of c to the orbital in which a hole is created by the pump pulse .",
    "a photon energy of 275 - 280 ev was suggested for this purpose .",
    "advances in laser technology have very recently been exploited to generate individual subfemtosecond pulses in this photon energy range @xcite .",
    "thus it is of interest to investigate ultra - fast dynamics involving inner - shell electrons .    as a first step towards the treatment of short laser pulses at a photon energy of 284 ev @xcite , we compare in the present study emission of the inner 1s electron with emission of the outer 2s or 2p electrons for the photon energy range between 170 and 245 ev . numerical studies of ultra - fast dynamics at 284 ev involving the c atom will require great care with the pulse shape to ensure that inner - shell ionization processes are not dominated by direct single - photon emission arising from the outer edges of the pulse bandwidth . in the present photon energy range , emission of a 1s electron requires absorption of ( at least ) two photons , whereas the emission of a 2s or 2p electron requires absorption of a single photon only",
    "this comparison is similar to a previous comparison of two - photon emission of the 1s electron versus one- and two - photon emission of the outer 2s electron using the r - matrix floquet approach for li@xmath9 @xcite or the 1s2s @xmath10s state in he @xcite .",
    "to study the response of the carbon atom , we use the recently developed time - dependent r - matrix approach rmt @xcite .",
    "it combines the capability of r - matrix theory to describe a wide range of processes in general atomic systems @xcite with the computational capability of the helium approach @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two techniques has enabled the determination of time delays in ne @xcite , and high - harmonic generation at mid - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for these studies , relatively little atomic structure was taken into account . by adopting an r - matrix with pseudo - states philosophy @xcite or an intermediate - energy r - matrix approach @xcite",
    ", we have recently demonstrated that the rmt codes can also be used for the study of double photoionization processes @xcite . to describe the double continuum accurately",
    ", extensive atomic structure needs to be taken into account .",
    "the success of these latter studies suggests that the rmt approach is capable of treating atoms in strong fields with a detailed description of atomic structure .    in the present study",
    ", we wish to explore the application of rmt theory to a case where electrons can be ejected from different shells with significantly different binding energy .",
    "this application poses new demands on the computational accuracy .",
    "the continuum needs to be accurate up to very high energies to describe relevant above - threshold ionization processes involving outer electrons .",
    "this has the computational consequence of increasing the round - off error in matching the wavefunction at the boundary between the inner and outer r - matrix regions , where the description of the ejected electron changes from basis - set techniques to finite - difference methods .",
    "hence the application of the rmt approach to inner - shell processes presents new demands on the computer codes .    in section [ sec : comp ] , we give a short overview of the rmt approach .",
    "we also provide a brief description of the basis set used to describe the c atom , and the laser pulse .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] with an emphasis on the competition between the multiphoton emission of an inner 1s electron and single- and multiphoton emission of an outer @xmath2 electron .",
    "time - dependent r - matrix theory is the extension of the standard r - matrix approach @xcite to the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "although the initial applications of time - dependent r - matrix theory described electrons restricted to a finite region surrounding the nucleus @xcite , subsequent implementations adopted the standard r - matrix concept of division of space into two distinct regions : an inner region in which all electrons are close to the nucleus , and an outer region in which one electron has moved well away from the others . in the original formulation of time - dependent r - matrix theory , an r - matrix propagation scheme was employed to propagate the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "this approach relies on the solution of systems of equations throughout the calculation , and as a consequence calculation time increases rapidly with an increase in atomic structure .",
    "the most recent implementation of time - dependent r - matrix theory is r - matrix theory with time dependence ( rmt ) @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the wavefunction in the inner region is described in terms of a standard r - matrix basis with a b - spline representation of the continuum orbitals .",
    "the wavefunction in the outer region is described in terms of a direct product of a residual - ion state coupled with a finite - difference representation of the wavefunction for the outer electron . near the boundary between inner and outer region ,",
    "the wavefunction must be shared by the inner and outer regions .",
    "this is achieved through evaluation of the inner - region wavefunction on an outer - region grid extension into the inner region for use by the outer region .",
    "the outer - region wavefunction information needed by the inner region consists of spatial derivatives of the outer - region wavefunction at the inner - region boundary .",
    "the main advantage of the rmt approach over the previous implementation is its improved accuracy and numerical efficiency .",
    "whereas the previous implementation used a low - order crank - nicolson propagator , the rmt approach uses a high - order arnoldi propagator @xcite .",
    "this replaces a solution of a system of linear equations by repeated matrix - vector multiplications , which may reduce numerical error in the time and spatial propagation of the wavefunction .",
    "since the arnoldi propagator is dominated by matrix - vector multiplications , the rmt codes can be parallelised more efficiently , so that calculations exploiting in excess of 2000 cores are feasible .    in the present study",
    ", we aim to investigate inner - shell ionization processes involving the carbon atom .",
    "we are thus interested in residual - ion states with a hole in the 1s shell . within the r - matrix codes ,",
    "residual - ion states are retained in order of energy . as a consequence , all possible residual - ion states with a filled 1s@xmath6 shell",
    "are included prior to inclusion of the residual - ion states with a hole in the 1s shell . in order to limit the scale of the calculations , we therefore adopt a minimal basis for the description of carbon .",
    "the atom is described using only the 1s , 2s and 2p hartree - fock orbitals of singly ionized carbon @xcite .",
    "we then use these orbitals to build all possible singly - charged residual - ion states : i.e. all states belonging to the 1s@xmath62s@xmath62p , 1s@xmath62s2p@xmath6 , 1s@xmath62p@xmath4 , 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath6 , 1s2s2p@xmath4 and 1s2p@xmath5 configurations of c@xmath3 .",
    "the neutral - atom basis then contains all combinations of these residual - ion states with a set of b - spline based continuum orbitals up to a maximum total angular momentum @xmath11 .",
    "we use a total of 125 b - splines of order 9 to build these continuum orbitals .",
    "this basis also includes so - called correlation functions made of all combinations for 6 electrons across the 1s , 2s and 2p orbitals with at least one electron in 1s .",
    "the inner - region boundary is set to 27 @xmath12 .",
    "the application of rmt theory using this basis set to describe the atom poses a new challenge : a challenge that applies to all studies of inner - shell ionization processes . to describe all ionization processes properly ,",
    "a good description of the continuum is needed for emission of both inner and outer electrons , including multiphoton emission processes .",
    "multiphoton emission of outer electrons , in particular , can lead to very high continuum energies .",
    "an extensive expansion of the continuum is therefore required in the inner region , which allows for the description of rapidly oscillating continuum functions . as a consequence ,",
    "the so - called knot points of the b - spline basis set are more closely spaced than in a calculation for outer electrons only : 125 b - splines in the present case , compared to 70 for the outer - electron calculation @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the bloch operator to maintain hermiticity of the hamiltonian in the inner region then generates eigenfunctions with large eigenvalues ( up to 200 kev ) which are sharply peaked near the r - matrix boundary .",
    "since these functions are peaked near the boundary , they need to be retained in the calculations . however , the effect of the large eigenvalues must be compensated for through the connection between the inner region and the outer region .",
    "hence , a cancellation of terms involving large energies occurs at every stage of the calculation .",
    "this cancellation can be a prime source of numerical error , and extra care therefore needs to be taken to ensure numerical stability of the calculations , for example through a significant reduction of the time - step in the calculation .    within the rmt approach",
    ", the light field is assumed to be linearly polarized and described within the length form of the dipole approximation due to the necessity to restrict the residual - ion basis @xcite .",
    "the field is described by an ultra - short light pulse of eight cycles , including a three - cycle @xmath13 ramp - on and ramp - off , with two cycles at peak intensity .",
    "the photon energies in the present study range from 170 ev to 245 ev , so that a single photon suffices to eject an outer @xmath2 electron , but absorption of two photons is required to emit the 1s electron .",
    "the bandwidth of the pulse is about 40 ev ( full width at half maximum ) at a photon energy of 245 ev .",
    "after the pulse has ended , we propagate the wavefunction for another 42 cycles to ensure that all ejected electrons have entered the outer region .",
    "the time - step used in the calculation is 0.012 as .",
    "the outer - region finite difference grid has a spacing of 0.025 @xmath12 , and extends out to a distance of 816 @xmath12 .",
    "we use an arnoldi propagator of order 10 .",
    "in the present study , we aim to investigate the competition between single - photon emission of a @xmath2 electron and two - photon emission of a 1s electron from a carbon atom in the photon energy range between 170 and 245 ev . since the c ground state has @xmath4p@xmath14 symmetry , the initial state can have @xmath15 and 1 . in all results presented ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we have averaged over the different initial @xmath16-values . for non - zero",
    "initial @xmath16 , the @xmath17 symmetry is not available , whereas for zero @xmath16 radiative transitions with @xmath18 are not allowed .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ionstatepop ]    the rmt calculations also provide the populations in the various residual c@xmath3 states .",
    "table [ tab : ionstatepop ] provides the final populations for all c@xmath3 states included in the calculations for photon energies of 170 ev , 197 ev and 224 ev at an intensity of 10@xmath0 w/@xmath1 . for the photon energies given in the table",
    ", effects due to the bandwidth of the pulse are expected to play only a minor role , and should not affect the final populations significantly .",
    "the table demonstrates that the main residual ion states are the 1s@xmath62s2p@xmath6 @xmath5p@xmath14 and @xmath6p@xmath14 states indicating a dominance of direct emission of a 2s electron .",
    "emission of a 2p electron accounts for 20% of the emission processes at 170 ev and only 14% at 224 ev .",
    "c@xmath3 is left in a 1s@xmath62p@xmath4 state in about 5.2 - 5.7% of all emission processes .",
    "this latter outcome is only a factor 4 more likely than the emission of an inner 1s electron , which occurs in 1.4 - 2.0% of all emission processes .",
    "in addition , table [ tab : ionstatepop ] shows that the emission of the inner electrons can involve the outer electrons .",
    "the outer electrons are left in a 2s@xmath62p@xmath6 configuration in 91 - 93% of all 1s emission processes .",
    "however , the final distribution over the 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath6 shows deviations from the statistical distribution of a 2:1 ratio between the @xmath5p@xmath14 and the @xmath6p@xmath14 state , with a 5:3 ratio at 170 ev and a ratio of 2.1:1 at a photon energy of 224 ev . in 7 - 9% of the 1s ionization processes ,",
    "a change in the outer electron population occurs , mainly an excitation of a 2s electron to 2p .",
    "this suggests that in just under 10% of the processes , two different electrons absorb a photon .",
    "hence this provides a signature of a multi - electron response to the light field , which may involve a sequential process , whereby the first photon excites a 1s electron to 2p , followed by photoemission of one of the 2s electrons .",
    "the table demonstrates that all emission processes involving an outer 2s or 2p electron decrease in magnitude with increasing photon energy .",
    "however , this pattern changes when a 1s electron is emitted . although the population in the dominant residual - ion states after emission of a 1s electron ( 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath6 @xmath6p@xmath14 and @xmath5p@xmath14 ) shows a decrease in final population with increasing photon energy , for the other 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath6 states , for five out of nine 1s2s2p@xmath4 residual - ion states and all 1s2p@xmath5 states , the final population is larger at a photon energy of 224 ev than at a photon energy of 197 ev .",
    "this could be due to an intermediate resonance , but it could also originate from the closer proximity of the threshold for single - photon emission of a 1s electron at this higher photon energy .     as a function of photon energy at an intensity of 10@xmath0 w/@xmath1.,width=340 ]    to investigate the origin of the increase , we have carried out further calculations of inner - shell photoemission of c atoms covering the photon - energy range between 170 and 245 ev .",
    "outcomes of these calculations are shown in figure [ fig : carbonconf ] . to maintain clarity",
    ", the figure shows the probability that the c@xmath3 ion is left in a particular configuration , rather than in individual states within the configuration .",
    "most residual c@xmath3 ions are left in the 1s@xmath62s2p@xmath6 configuration , indicating that emission of a 2s electron is the most likely photoionization process .",
    "the probability of emission of a 2p electron is about a factor 4 times smaller at 170 ev , and this probability decreases with increasing photon energy .",
    "the probability that the c@xmath3 ion is left in 1s@xmath62p@xmath4 is over an order of magnitude smaller than the probability for emission of a 2s electron .",
    "emission of a 1s electron preferentially leaves the c@xmath3 ion in the 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath6 configuration , accounting for about 2% of the photoionization processes at 170 ev .",
    "this probability increases beyond 230 ev , and reaches about 5% for 245 ev .",
    "this increase at the highest photon energies can be ascribed to the increasing proximity of the threshold for single - photon emission of the 1s electron .",
    "figure [ fig : carbonconf ] shows that the probability of leaving the residual c@xmath3 ion in the 1s2s2p@xmath4 and 1s2p@xmath5 configurations are resonantly enhanced at a photon energy of 224 ev .",
    "the populations in the 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath6 configuration show an enhancement near the threshold for single - photon emission of a 1s electron , but this enhancement only becomes noticeable above a photon energy of 230 ev .",
    "the most likely origin of the enhancement is the intermediate 1s2s@xmath62p@xmath4 configuration reached by photoexcitation of a 1s electron into the 2p shell .",
    "the ultra - short duration of the pulse means that the effect of the intermediate configuration is apparent over a broad photon energy range with very little structure .",
    "since the effects of the resonances are spread out over a broad photon energy range , the overall increase in the ionization probability will be reduced , and as a consequence resonant enhancement is only visible for the weakest photoionization channels .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the capability of rmt theory to investigate ultra - fast inner - shell emission processes in general multi - electron atoms .",
    "two - photon emission of a 1s electron from c atoms was investigated in the photon energy range between 175 and 245 ev . at an intensity of 10@xmath0 w/@xmath1 , two - photon emission of the 1s electron accounts for about 2 - 3% of all photoionization processes . at the two - photon level ,",
    "emission of the 1s electron is about a factor two more likely than the emission of either a 2p or a 2s electron combined . through examination of the final configuration of the residual c@xmath3 ion , we have furthermore observed evidence for resonant enhancement of the 1s emission .",
    "finally , by comparing ionization yields in different symmetries across multiple intensities , we have determined an above - threshold ionization yield for inner - shell photoemission of the 1s electron in c.    the determination of inner - shell processes in general multi - electron atoms poses a number of challenges .",
    "the present calculations have been carried out using hartree - fock orbitals for ground - state c. the description of the residual ion states can be improved by expanding the initial orbital set to include pseudo orbitals .",
    "however , the inclusion of pseudo - orbitals will lead to significantly larger calculations .",
    "the main reason for this is that residual - ion states are retained in the present r - matrix calculations in order of energy .",
    "the lowest energy states will be dominated by states with two 1s electrons .",
    "these states can involve the hartree - fock 2s and 2p orbitals , but may also involve the additional pseudo - orbitals .",
    "hence , a significant number of states dominated by pseudo - orbitals may have to be included before one reaches the ionic states corresponding to emission of a 1s electron .",
    "furthermore , the calculations require a good description of the continuum up to high energy .",
    "this leads to much higher energies associated with the bloch operator .",
    "the higher energies reached in the present calculations do not yet affect the stability of the rmt approach .",
    "a further open question concerns the influence of non - dipole terms .",
    "the present study assumes that the dipole approximation holds .",
    "this approximation is not unreasonable for the interaction between the laser field and the 1s orbital .",
    "however , the approximation may not be as suitable for describing the interactions between the @xmath2 electrons and the laser field .",
    "the investigation of non - dipole effects would require substantial computational development .",
    "the rmt codes themselves will need to be modified to ensure that all relevant interactions arising from the laser field are properly taken into account .",
    "more importantly , the inner - region r - matrix codes need modification so that higher - order transitions are calculated within the inner region , and generated in a form suitable for use within the rmt codes .",
