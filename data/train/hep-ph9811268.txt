    "oscillations imply at least one non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "definitive evidence of massive neutrinos requires modifying the standard model of electroweak interactions .    the super - kamiokande collaboration measures neutrino fluxes from observations of electrons and muons in neutrino nucleon interactions : @xmath7 .",
    "in view of the importance of the question of whether or not neutrinos have mass , one would like to see not just @xmath5 disappearance , but also the @xmath6 appearance coming from @xmath8 oscillations .",
    "oscillation sources of @xmath6 s include oscillations on the terrestrial scale from atmospheric @xmath5 s as well as oscillations over large astronomical distances of @xmath5 s produced in , for example , active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "a background to the flux of neutrinos from @xmath8 are tau neutrinos produced directly in the atmosphere .",
    "tau neutrinos are produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray collisions with nuclei in the atmosphere , which produce charm quark pairs .",
    "a fraction of the time , the emerging hadrons are @xmath9 s , which have a leptonic decay channel @xmath10 with a branching ratio of a few percent .",

    "the details of the method as applied to atmospheric electron neutrino , muon neutrino and muon fluxes from charm decay appear in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present our flux results for the neutrino energy range of @xmath12 gev , followed by the resulting @xmath13 event rates . for tau energies above 100 gev ,",
    "the rate is on the order of @xmath14 events per year per km@xmath3 water equivalent volume . with a 1 tev threshold ,",

    "we also evaluate the expected event rate for the tau neutrino flux coming from @xmath8 oscillations based on a range of parameters consistent with the super - kamiokande results @xcite .",
    "for tau energies above a few hundred gev , the atmospheric tau neutrino background flux from @xmath15 dominates the tau neutrino flux from atmospheric muon neutrino oscillations .",

    "solutions to the cascade equations in terms of @xmath30-moments have two separate forms , depending on whether the decay lengths are short compared to the height of production ( `` low energy '' ) or long ( `` high energy '' ) . for @xmath6 s from @xmath9 ( and @xmath11 ) decays , we confine our attention to the neutrino energy range @xmath12 gev .",
    "these neutrino energies are well below the critical energy of @xmath31 gev , above which decay lengths of the relativistic @xmath9 s and @xmath11 s are longer than the vertical distance to height of production .",

    ", one should also take into account the neutrinos produced by the semileptonic decay of the @xmath77 quark ( @xmath78 ) followed by the decay of the tau , but this contribution is less than a few percent of charmed meson source .",
    "the dotted line represents the flux from @xmath77 quark production and decay in the limit of zero polarization for the tau .",
    "the fact that the flux calculated using nlo perturbative qcd differs from the tig pythia based calculation @xcite is apparently due to the inclusion of fragmentation effects in the pythia monte carlo .",

    "large underground experiments may detect @xmath6-nucleon charged current interactions @xmath89 . in the absence of @xmath90 oscillations , event rates @xcite for @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 tev are shown in table ii .",
    "we have summed over neutrino and antineutrinos and assumed that there is no attenuation of the @xmath6 flux due to passage through the earth at these energies @xcite .",
    "detection of atmospheric @xmath6 s in the absence of oscillations requires large detector volumes , on the order of 1 km@xmath3 water equivalent volume for @xmath93 events per year with a tau energy threshold of 100 gev .",
    "such large detector volumes for the detection of @xmath5 charged current interactions are being considered @xcite .    in the case of neutrino oscillations , atmospheric muon neutrinos",
    "may oscillate as they travel to the detector .",
    "even with a small fraction of @xmath8 conversions , the copious production of @xmath5 s in the atmosphere make this a potentially large source of @xmath6 s .",
    "again , assuming no attenuation due to neutrino interactions in the earth , and approximating the height of production in the atmosphere by a constant 20 km @xcite , we have evaluated the probability of oscillation in terms of neutrino energy and zenith angle . using the bartol muon neutrino flux @xcite",
    "from @xmath94 and @xmath95 decays extrapolated to @xmath96 gev , adding the nlo prompt @xmath5 flux @xcite and integrating over zenith angle , table iii shows the event rates for two limiting values of @xmath97 , the difference between the squares of the tau neutrino and muon neutrino masses , quoted by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have set the oscillation mixing angle @xmath98 . for the larger mass difference , @xmath8 events overwhelm the prompt @xmath6 events for @xmath99 gev , while for the lower mass difference the rates are comparable .",
    "tau neutrino oscillations to @xmath5 in this parameter range have a negligible depletion of the prompt @xmath100 event rate .    for @xmath92 tev , because prompt fluxes decrease less rapidly with energy than the muon neutrino flux coupled with oscillations , the prompt @xmath6 s dominate the event rate .",
    "the cross over to prompt @xmath6 domination of the flux occurs at a few hundred gev .",
    "another distinction between prompt and oscillation tau neutrinos is the angular distribution .",
    "the prompt source is isotropic , while the oscillation to @xmath6 s will be strongly angular dependent , with the most @xmath6 s traveling upward because of the long path length .",
    "we have concentrated here on atmospheric sources of prompt @xmath6 s and atmospheric @xmath8 .",
    "there are many flux models of astrophysical sources of @xmath5 s @xcite . if neutrinos have mass , because of the large astronomical distance scales , on the order of half of the @xmath5 s would oscillate to @xmath6 s .",
    "the detectability of @xmath100 conversions in the pev energy range has been explored in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is clear from our calculation that the atmospheric tau neutrino flux is negligible at pev energies .",
