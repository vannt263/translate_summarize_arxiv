    "* grb 970228 ) , the restframe properties of about 50 host galaxies of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) have been identified .",
    "already with a small sample it became clear that the hosts are preferentially faint blue irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "this trend was recently confirmed by a comparison between hosts of lgrbs and hosts of core - collapse supernovae ( cc sne ) .",
    "cc sne were found in late - type galaxies of all morphologies and luminosities , in contrast to lgrb hosts , which were still found to be almost exclusively irregular and on average fainter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f06 ) .",
    "since both cc sne and lgrbs are considered explosions of massive young stars with ages below @xmath4  myr and probably below the typical timescale of star formation in most galaxies , there is _ apriori _ no reason to expect a considerable difference in their host galaxies .",
    "cc sne should be direct and unbiased tracers of very recent star formation , although complications may arise from dust extinction intrinsic to the host .",
    "furthermore , we expect a dependence of the mass threshold for core collapse / black - hole formation on metallicity @xcite and binary evolution effects @xcite .",
    "the suggested explanation for the host preference of lgrbs is that they arise from low - metallicity stellar populations which are predominantly found in low - luminosity galaxies according to the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kk04 ) . also , in several progenitor models of grbs ( in particular",
    " models ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wind mass loss plays an important role in slowing down the rotation of massive stellar cores . since lower metallicity leads to weaker stellar winds and hence less angular - momentum loss , the stars are more likely to retain rapidly rotating cores at the time of the explosion , as required in the collapsar model .",
    "lgrbs discovered by the _ swift _ mission have a median redshift of 2.75 and apparently have a distribution expected for an unbiased tracer of star formation @xcite . if both the cosmic star formation history and the cosmic evolution of metallicity in cold star - forming gas were known with high accuracy , this redshift distribution could provide clues about the metallicity dependence of the lgrb rate .",
    "however , the lgrbs discovered by bepposax have a median redshift near @xmath5 , and predictions for the completeness function are very difficult to make , owing to the complexity of grb trigger algorithms and detector intricacies .",
    "even with a much larger sample , the redshift distribution of grbs might be affected by systematic uncertainties such that no strong constraints on metallicity can be found .    instead",
    ", first spectroscopic measurements of the metallicity of lgrb hosts at redshifts @xmath6 from the ghost studies @xcite indicate that lgrb hosts follow the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation of star - forming galaxies .",
    "a preference for low metallicity would then require lgrbs to favour less luminous galaxies more than general star formation does . when working with gas - phase metallicities of galaxies , we need to be aware of the _ calibration debate _ between two basic methods which result in numbers that differ by a factor of @xmath7 : spectra of low signal - to - noise only facilitate an indirect strong - line method ( pagel s @xmath8 indicator , 1979 ) to measure metallicity , which is calibrated against photoionization models .",
    "in contrast , high - s / n spectra allow for a direct measurement of metallicity taking into account the electron temperature measured from weak auroral lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath9-based methods find typically 0.20.5 dex lower metallicities , but have been critized to be biased by not taking inhomogeneities in the temperature into account .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to derive constraints on the metallicity dependence of lgrb progenitors by comparing forward predictions of host luminosity distributions with the observed host sample .",
    "we apply a minor modification to the f06 samples by restricting them to identical redshift ranges @xmath10 $ ] ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "our quantitative predictions of the host luminosity distribution is based on luminosity functions and star - formation rates of galaxies and their luminosity  metallicity relations ( see sect .  3 ) . here , we need to make sure that all ingredients are on the exact same metallicity calibrator and opt for the strong - line method on the kk04 calibrator for consistency .",
    "we then fold in different prescriptions for the metallicity dependence of the lgrb event rate and constrain these by comparing our predictions to the observed sample in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the results and the implications of the calibration debate . throughout the paper",

    "we use the revised solar oxygen abundance of @xmath13 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "this work is based on the host galaxy data of cc sne and lgrbs collected by f06 .",
    "the cc sne were all discovered by the hubble higher redshift supernova search @xcite in the two hst goods fields @xcite .",
    "this search was only sensitive to cc sne at @xmath14 and may already be incomplete at the upper end of this redshift range @xcite .",
    "the lgrbs were taken by f06 from public hst data of host galaxy observations , where the list of objects extends to redshifts above 4 .    at redshifts @xmath15 ,",
    "the hst goods survey has too little volume to detect cc sne efficiently .",
    "the same restriction applies to samples of lgrbs with typical gamma - ray luminosities .",
    "however , the grb list contains a few very nearby objects with extremely low gamma - ray luminosities , which may be viewed at larger angles or be intrinsically faint events , and possibly an altogether different kind of explosion ( see the ensuing discussion on grb 060218 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to exclude these peculiar grb events , which we could only see at redshifts @xmath16 , we restrict the existing cc sn and lgrb data to a subsample in the redshift range @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we note , that this is similar to but more conservative than the comparison considered by f06 , which includes lgrbs up to @xmath18 .    as a result , we keep the full sample of 16 cc sne with a mean redshift of 0.63 , while the lgrb sample is restricted to 16 events with a mean redshift of 0.69 , so they are on average from an extremely similar cosmic epoch .",
    "we wish to model restframe @xmath19-band luminosity distributions for the host galaxies of both types of explosive events in order to compare them with the observed distribution from the restricted f06 sample . for this purpose",
    "we ultimately need a distribution of star - formation density over @xmath19-band host luminosity and potentially a metallicity - dependent efficiency function .",
    "* hereafter w05 ) measured the restframe uv ( 280  nm ) luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies from a sample of almost 1500 galaxies at a mean redshift of @xmath20 .",
    "based on morphological classifications from the gems survey @xcite , the lfs were also split by galaxy type .",
    "the mean redshift of these lfs coincides with that of the host galaxy samples for the cc sne and lgrbs considered here .",
    "hence , they can serve as an unbiased description of the general galaxy population at the redshift of the events .",
    "the lf @xmath21 , is parameterized as a schechter function    @xmath22    we chose the restframe uv luminosity at 280  nm , @xmath23 , since it can be used as a proxy for the unobscured star - formation rate using the relation of @xcite    @xmath24    evidently , the total star - formation rate of a galaxy depends also on the amount of obscured star formation , which could be measured from the thermal fir dust emission or crudely estimated using uv spectral slopes .    however , both cc sne and lgrb afterglows are subject to host galaxy extinction as well , just as expected for events occuring in very young stellar populations .",
    "in fact , star - bursting galaxies do not only have an above average proportion of obscured star formation , but also an increased rate of obscured , optically invisible cc sne , which can be found by nir monitoring @xcite . such sne are absent in the sample used here , which is based on a restframe uv - optical search .",
    "present data for lgrb afterglows show no evidence for high levels of dust obscuration , while a fraction of optically dark lgrbs may still be due to high dust extinction in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the host galaxies of known lgrbs show no significant signs of dust - obscured star formation @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that a comparison of uv - based star formation measures with uv - optical detection rates of stellar explosions is fair",
    ". it would be next to impossible to attempt an accurate extinction correction , which would need to take into account changes in the average extinction with progenitor lifetime as well as detailed detection efficiencies for events of different extinction levels .    for our model",
    ", we first calculate the distribution of uv luminosity density @xmath25 cumulative over uv host luminosity @xmath23 using the integral    @xmath26    given the kennicutt law , this quantity is an estimate of the unobscured star - formation density in hosts of @xmath27 .",
    "hence , it also describes the host distribution of any explosive event which is proportional to the star - formation rate . as an example , cc sne are broadly expected to be an unbiased tracer of star formation , and should have a host distribution described by ( [ hdflat ] ) .    in a second step ,",
    "we transform the uv luminosity axis @xmath23 into @xmath28 to match the given luminosity data of the host sample . for this purpose , we need to know the @xmath29-colours of star - forming galaxies .",
    "these data have been obtained by the combo-17 survey and are publicly available for the chandra deep field south @xcite covering the entire gems field . the galaxy sample used for the above lfs",
    "can be split into a red sequence of mostly passively evolving galaxies and a blue cloud of mostly star - forming galaxies . for star - forming galaxies at @xmath30 ,",
    "the colour - magnitude relation is ( see fig .  5 of w05 )",
    "@xmath31    hence , the lower integration limit in the calculation of the luminosity density can be substituted as    @xmath32    this is equivalent to stretching the scale of the luminosity axis by 11% and holding it fixed at @xmath33 , where the average colour of star - forming galaxies is zero .",

    "although galaxy morphology may not be a suitable physical factor for the evolution of high - mass stars in a galaxy , it may be correlated with physical factors : irregulars are mostly of lower - luminosity and hence tend to be of lower metallicity , which may well be the physical cause of the increased lgrb rate .",
    "we now briefly try to confirm the picture suggested by f06 , and test a toy model in which cc sne arise unbiased from ( unobscured ) star formation in all galaxies while lgrbs arise unbiased from irregular galaxies .",
    "we model the host luminosity distributions using the parameters of the lfs obtained by w05 for irregular galaxies and _ all _ galaxies ( see tab .",
    "[ lfs ] ) .",
    "note that the model is only a normalised cumulative luminosity distribution .",
    "hence , it does not constrain overall rates , and it also does not depend on the normalisation @xmath40 of the lf , but only on the slope @xmath35 of the faint end and the location @xmath41 of the break in the lf .",
    "this toy model is compared with the sample data in fig .",
    "we find that cc sne match the prediction extremely well and conclude that they can be considered an unbiased proxy for star formation in all galaxies within the limits of this small data set .",
    "also , the prediction for irregular galaxies matches the host data for lgrbs reasonably well , although there is some deviation at low luminosities .",
    "formally , both comparisons are entirely acceptable : a kolmogorov - smirnov test yields values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively ( corresponding to rejection probabilities of only 4% and 22% ) .",
    "we note , that the lfs are well - determined at @xmath44 but extrapolated with a schechter function at fainter magnitudes .",
    "any errors in this extrapolation will translate into a simple rescaling of the cumulative host prediction at @xmath45 brighter than @xmath46 , whereas the fainter section would change its shape .",
    "we choose to ignore the errors in the previous qualitative analysis and present a more quantitative study , using metallicity as the physical factor controlling the lgrb efficiency , in the following sections .",

    "our use of the term metallicity denotes the abundance of oxygen in the ionised gas phase as a tracer of metallicity in young high - mass stars .",
    "we use the o / h ratio measured via the @xmath8-index on the kk04 calibration .",
    "this index is determined from flux ratios in the prominent ionized oxygen and h@xmath55 emission lines of star - forming galaxies , which are relatively easy to observe even in faint galaxies at higher redshifts . of course",
    ", it would also be attractive to look at abundances of other elements .",
    "however , these are more challenging to measure , and we believe that , with the present small sample of objects , we would not be able to improve our study significantly . as an abbreviation we will use the notation    @xmath56    recent determinations of the luminosity  metallicity ( @xmath0@xmath57 ) or the stellar mass  metallicity ( @xmath58@xmath59 ) relation include the work by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also use the two one - sided fits to define a confidence interval for the relation ( see tab .",
    "[ kk04fits ] for fit parameters ) .",

    ", the metallicity has a @xmath69-scatter of 0.16  dex , the same as that determined in a large sample of luminous galaxies from sdss @xcite .",
    "the scatter of the mass  metallicity relation is even less ( 0.10 ) , and in the absence of any higher - redshift data we assume that it is well - behaved also for dwarfs at @xmath30 . in any case , both the @xmath0@xmath59-relation and the uv luminosity function are just extrapolated below @xmath70 in our analysis .",
    "below we first investigate the effects of a sharp metallicity cutoff for the production of lgrbs in our model .",
    "if we ignored both the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath59-relation and the internal variations of @xmath59 among the young stellar population within any given galaxy , a sharp @xmath59-cutoff would cause a sharp @xmath45-cutoff in the host galaxy sample .",
    "while we do not have perfect knowledge of the overall @xmath59 scatter , it certainly needs to be taken into account for the prediction of cumulative host luminosity distributions in the presence of @xmath59-dependent event efficiencies .",
    "even for the same data , the scatter of the @xmath0@xmath59-relation for average galaxy metallicities varies with the slope of the fit . roughly , it is around @xmath71  dex end - to - end for a given luminosity at @xmath30 , consistent with a @xmath69-scatter of 0.16 at low redshift . as far as the @xmath59-spread of star - forming gas within a galaxy",
    "is concerned , we lack useful knowledge at @xmath72 owing to the limited spatial resolution of spectroscopic data , especially for smaller galaxies .",
    "instead , we look at the present - day magellanic clouds for clues on the @xmath59 variation within irregulars . the lmc appears to resemble a typical lgrb host at @xmath73 given its luminosity of @xmath74 .",
    "the lmc and smc have measured metallicities in young stars and the gas phase of 0.5 solar and 0.2 solar , respectively , and both have internal 1@xmath75-variations of @xmath76  dex @xcite . dispersions in milky way - size disk galaxies are not expected to be larger either , given efficient gas mixing .    in principle , we need to convolve the distribution of the internal @xmath59 variation and the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath59-relation to obtain a realistic cosmic @xmath77-distribution .",
    "but in the absence of any accurate values for the former , we consider two alternative scenarios for the combined metallicity variation by using the form    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is taken from the @xmath0@xmath59-relation ( [ zfit ] ) and @xmath80 is the end - to - end spread in the variation applied at any fixed @xmath45 .",
    "we opted to use a cosine function , because it is trivial to integrate analytically .",
    "two other simple alternatives appear unrealistic , a box function because of its steep edges and a gaussian because of its infinitely far - reaching wings .",
    "overall , we consider @xmath81  dex a realistic value for the combined spread at fixed host luminosity , which corresponds to about @xmath82  dex for the fwhm of the distribution @xmath83 .",
    "just for illustration we also explore an extreme value of @xmath84 , which translates into an extreme and unrealistic metallicity spread from ten - fold below to ten - fold above the fit value at any given luminosity .",
    "this will allow even very luminous galaxies in our model to form a fraction of very low-@xmath59 stars .            here , we specify our descriptions for the dependence of the lgrb efficiency on the metallicity of young stars .",
    "we consider two simple one - parameter models and one two - parameter model , which is a compromise between the first two .",
    "any _ adhoc _ model that is more complicated than these makes little sense given the small number of 16 lgrbs in the sample .",
    "our adopted prescriptions are :    * a sharp high-@xmath59 cutoff : @xmath85 * a power law , which unfortunately diverges at low @xmath59 : @xmath86 * a broken power law , which is flat as in ( [ cut ] ) below a break metallicity @xmath87 and declines as in ( [ pl ] ) above the break : @xmath88    note , that for the single power law no normalisation is required as we are not dealing with absolute lgrb rates but only host distributions .",
    "also , model ( [ bpl ] ) contains the other models as special cases , because it converges into ( [ cut ] ) for @xmath89 , and into ( [ pl ] ) for @xmath90 .    the prescriptions for event efficiencies @xmath91 and for the metallicity distributions of star - forming gas @xmath77 in hosts of given luminosity @xmath45 are then included into our prediction of the v - band host luminosity distribution , using the new integral @xmath92 again , this figure is now proportional to the lgrb event rate expected for the assumed efficiency function .",
    "in this section , we compare our metallicity - dependent models with the host galaxy data . however , in sect .",
    "5.2 we will discuss empirical evidence that the lgrb hosts discussed here are on the l  z relation as far as we know , supporting the validity of our basic approach .      here , we use a constant efficiency up to a cutoff metallicity defined in eq .",

    "[ kk04fits ] to define fiducial confidence intervals .",
    "we find that changes in the slope of the @xmath0@xmath59-relation translate directly into changes in the luminosity spread of the curves predicted for a fixed set of cutoff metallicities , which is expected . fortuitously ,",
    "the data lie in a range that appears to be not very sensitive to the choice of the @xmath0@xmath59-fit .",
    "this is a result of the pivotal point in the @xmath0@xmath59-fit being close to @xmath95 .",
    "there are not enough grb hosts far away from the pivotal point of the @xmath0@xmath59-fit to let the slope make a large difference for the best - fitting cutoff metallicity .",
    "instead , the slope of the relation affects the formal errors on the cutoff , which one obtains from a fit to the data ( see sect .  4.4 ) .      as an alternative to a sharp cutoff model",
    ", we now test an efficiency function that smoothly changes with metallicity and choose a simple power law .",
    "the reference model of a constant efficiency for all galaxies is always shown for comparison , and corresponds to @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) .",
    "[ lzrange ] further shows the curves for power - law slopes of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which deviate increasingly from the reference model as high-@xmath59 grbs are more and more suppressed relative to low-@xmath59 events .",
    "any variation in @xmath101 has no effect on the curves , because the symmetric form of the @xmath59 distribution is averaged out with a power - law efficiency .",

    "so , fits a or c will produce the same curves , if suitable @xmath102-values are chosen .",
    "all curves for power laws predict a substantial contribution from extremely low - luminosity galaxies , which are not observed among grb hosts .",
    "this is due to the unrealistic divergence of the grb efficiency towards zero metallicity .",
    "the broken power law with flat low-@xmath59 efficiency combines the properties of the two previous models , a gradual decline towards higher metallicity and a constant , non - diverging efficiency at lower metallicity .",
    "hence , this model avoids the unrealistic and problematic divergence of the single power law , while being less restrictive than the cutoff model , providing the `` best of both worlds '' .",
    "the model is now described by two parameters , which provides more freedom to fit the data , but also introduces some degeneracy .",
    "while hard breaks are very similar to the cutoff models , the metallicity break locations for softer breaks become increasingly less constrained . especially , with only 16 grbs the data do not provide sufficient constraints for the model .",

    "we further calculated the fractions of the young stellar population that can produce lgrb progenitors for @xmath30 , the mean redshift of our lgrb sample , given the various efficiency prescriptions . in the metallicity - independent model where all galaxies contribute and match the cc sn distribution , this fraction is defined as equal to 1 . in the cutoff model",
    "the best - fitting value @xmath121 corresponds to fractions of @xmath122 .",
    "this means that because of the metallicity constraint the lgrb production efficiency is reduced by a factor of about one half compared to the efficiency if there were no metallicity constraint .",
    "this number is also consistent with half of the star formation and half of the cc sne originating from galaxies with lower metallicity than solar , or with lower luminosity than @xmath123 .",

    "a recent study of @xmath127-galaxies @xcite showed that there is a mass  metallicity relation in place but no well - defined @xmath0@xmath59-relation due to strong variations in the m / l - ratios of galaxies . in their study ,",

    ". a limit at @xmath130 would correspond to a mass limit of @xmath131 .",
    "in fact , the sample contains plenty of luminous galaxies below this mass with @xmath45 up to @xmath132 .",

    "bottom panel : _ comparison of the lgrb energy @xmath135 corrected for beaming by @xcite with the host metallicity .",
    "[ eisoz ] ]",
    "one difficulty with the present analysis could be host confusion .",
    "if the grbs took preferentially place in low - luminosity companions to the formally identified hosts , then the observed host luminosity distribution would be biased to higher luminosities , suggesting higher metallicity cutoffs .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate whether hst observations could resolve such dwarfs from their larger , mostly lmc - type companions at @xmath133 .",
    "however , if most lgrbs occurred in such small galaxies , one would also expect a large population of sufficiently isolated small dwarfs , where no confusion would take place .",
    "but the small number of observed isolated hosts with @xmath136 leaves little room for any adjustment of our results .    on the contrary ,",
    "it is possible that more massive lgrb hosts are missing from the sample : luminous dust - obscured star - bursting galaxies harbour a significant fraction of the overall cosmic star formation .",
    "if lgrbs occur in these , their optical afterglows may be invisible , which would depopulate the host sample specifically at the bright end .",
    "the cc sne host sample would be less affected by this effect , as cc sne have a lower average progenitor mass and hence longer average time delay from formation to explosion .",
    "this allows the progenitors to leave their immediate formation environment and travel into less obscured regions .",
    "the effect of progenitor mass on the distance to the likely formation site has been shown to apply in the comparison of sne ii and sne ib / c @xcite .",
    "the sample analysed here lacks by definition all so - called dark bursts , which may be related to massive dusty galaxies : grb 020127 only produced an x - ray afterglow , and the host was identified as a @xmath137 dusty ero galaxy with 5  @xmath138 luminosity @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed an extremely red ( @xmath139 ) afterglow to grb 030115 in an ero host galaxy with @xmath140 , suggesting that this burst was highly obscured by dust .",
    "the afterglow was only identified with nir observations and would have been missed by optical follow - up alone .",
    "again , for the more recent grb 050223 only an x - ray afterglow was seen by _ swift _ , but no optical afterglow .",
    "the host was shown to be a dusty galaxy with @xmath141 @xcite . _",
    "if there is a significant observational bias against lgrbs in massive dust - enshrouded galaxies , then the metallicity - dependence of lgrb rates may be rather weaker than our findings presently suggest .",
    "_    uncertainties also exist with respect to the calibration of oxygen gas - phase metallicities and on how the oxygen abundance is representative of other elements .",
    "e.g. , @xmath35-elements are often found to be enhanced in systems where the star - formation timescale is much shorter than the timescale for type ia supernovae .",
    "depending on the progenitor model for lgrbs , different elements might be most responsible for affecting opacities in stellar atmospheres / winds and hence stellar evolution .",
    "however , @xmath35-enhancements are typically observed in old ellipticals which are not at all common lgrb hosts or typical star - forming galaxies , and thus should not affect our analysis appreciably .    in summary ,",
    "solar metallicity appears to mark a pivotal point of roughly constant efficiency apparently independent of the softness of the break . at @xmath73 ,",
    "this metallicity seems typical for galaxies of @xmath142 in either @xmath0@xmath57-relation .",
    "the number ratio of cc sne to either side of this host luminosity cut is 1:1 , whereas it is 1:3 for lgrbs .",
    "if there was any doubt about the calibration of the oxygen abundance at @xmath73 , or the relevance of oxygen in comparison to other elements , then we could rephrase our main conclusion such that a most likely cutoff for lgrbs is around the mean metallicity ( by any measurement ) of @xmath123 galaxies at @xmath73 .",
    "several recent studies have aimed at constraining lgrb progenitors from direct measurements of host metallicities @xcite using very small samples : @xcite present measured metallicities for three lgrb hosts with values of @xmath143 .",
    "@xcite consider seven hosts at @xmath144 $ ] and find mean galaxy metallicities of 8.3 to 8.55 for five of them , while two hosts are clearly super - solar .",
    "they furthermore claim , that the hosts fall right onto the regular mass  metallicity relation of normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "this host sample with measured metallicities lacks the lowest - luminosity hosts and so contains preferentially higher metallicity galaxies .",
    "hence , their median metallicity is not representative , but the statement on consistency with the mass  metallicity relation is highly relevant .",
    "@xcite give a number of host metallicity determinations , which are collected from the literature and converted onto the same ( kk04 ) calibrator , which is also the calibrator used in this paper for the @xmath0@xmath59-relation .",
    "five of the above hosts are actually part of the lgrb host sample used here .",
    "their spectroscopic metallicities are compared to the estimated values we have assigned to them using @xmath0@xmath59-fit b. we find them all to be within @xmath145  dex of the relation with a mean of @xmath146  dex , which is consistent with no bias within the statistical power of five objects .",
    "this results is not surprising .",
    "a physical model for grb progenitors may incorporate an explicit metallicity dependence , but we can not expect the progenitor to know explicitely about galaxy parameters such as luminosity or morphology . at a fixed metallicity level , we would then expect bursts predominantly from those galaxy mass bins containing the highest star - formation rate . here , both the shape of the mass function and the sfr trends with mass play a role",
    ". presumably , the declining mass function and the increasing sfr with mass cancel to some extent .",
    "kk04 searched for trends of galaxy properties within the scatter of their @xmath0@xmath59-relation . while they found no such trends , they particularly did not find strongly star - forming galaxies on the bright or metal - poor side of the relation .",
    "however , among very low - mass dwarf galaxies it is conceivable , that strong variations in sfr with time lead to such strong variations in mass - to - light ratio , such that cc sne and lgrbs are found predominantly on the bright side of the relation . presumably , this would have no effect for our analysis , as the mean metallicity bias would be small and remain within the flat portion of the parametric efficiency functions considered in this paper .",
    "we would like to point out , that even spectroscopic , but spatially unresolved , measurements of a mean host metallicity do not directly reflect the metallicity of the young stellar population near the lgrb progenitor .",
    "in fact , the error in the progenitor metallicity is dominated by the internal @xmath59 dispersion of the galaxy , which is estimated to be as large as the dispersion of galaxy - averaged @xmath59 values in the @xmath0@xmath59-relation ( @xmath76  dex ) .",
    "if we make no prior assumptions on lgrb hosts and accept the result that lgrb hosts follow the usual @xmath0@xmath59-relation , then we can in turn estimate even inidividual host metallicities from this relation .",
    "these individual estimates then have errors on the order of the dispersion in the @xmath0@xmath59-relation , i.e. @xmath76  dex .",
    "in other words , owing to the internal metallicity dispersion , our indirect estimate of the progenitor metallicity via the @xmath0@xmath57-relation of the host galaxy should be almost as useful as an unresolved spectroscopic observation , with an error that is roughly larger by a factor of @xmath147 .",
    "if the internal metallicity dispersions exceeded 0.2  dex , then the determination of integrated metallicities of individual lgrb hosts would have very little value , because it could as well be estimated from an @xmath0@xmath57-relation , while the error was mostly internal in origin .",
    "therefore , major progress can mostly be expected from spatially resolved metallicity measurements that focus on the immediate burst environment .",
    "however , such observations are currently not possible for grbs at cosmological distances .",
    "@xcite suggest a tentative relation between host metallicity @xmath59 and the isotropic energy associated with the lgrb @xmath148 , which they interpret as a metallicity cutoff around 0.15 solar for regular cosmological bursts .",
    "this conjecture is based on one object out of five , where a high lgrb energy coincides with low host metallicity.while this object was assigned a much higher host metallicity in a previous analysis @xcite , the mass of the galaxy makes that interpretation very unlikely .",
    "while the claimed relation relies on the significance of this single object , it is unclear whether the other ( underluminous ) lgrbs are representative of the more energetic and distant cosmological bursts .",
    "grb 060218 , e.g. , could not even have been detected by _",
    "swift _ at redshifts @xmath149 .    even in the absence of spectroscopic metallicity measurements for the individual hosts",
    ", we can tentatively investigate such a relation for the full sample with known @xmath150 and host luminosities using the @xmath0@xmath59-relation .",
    "[ eisoz ] shows the result for 13 grbs from our sample ( black data points ) which have @xmath150 values in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also add the five local objects discussed by @xcite based on their actual host @xmath59-data as grey data points .",
    "at least for the cosmological bursts ( black ) no relation is apparent .",
    "however , due to the expected significant variations in jet geometry and viewing angle among the bursts , we would not expect the fiducial isotropic energy estimate to show very clear trends with other parameters .",
    "@xcite present lgrb energies @xmath135 that are corrected for jet beaming effects . correspondingly , their ghirlanda relation @xmath135 vs. @xmath151 is much more clearly defined than the original amati relation @xmath150 vs.   @xmath151 @xcite , where @xmath151 is the restframe photon energy at the peak in the @xmath152 spectrum . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ eisoz ] , we show @xmath135 vs.  the host metallicity for the bursts with available data .",
    "we find no trend in these data .      from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it is not surprising that metallicity plays an important role for lgrb progenitors . in one of the most promising progenitor scenarios , the collapsar model ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , the progenitor is the rapidly rotating core of a massive star . on the other hand ,",
    "the core of a massive star is believed to efficiently lose angular momentum during its evolution : both within the star by hydrodynamical ( e.g. heger , langer & woosley 2000 ) and magnetohydrodynamical processes ( e.g. spruit 2002 ) and subsequently from the surface of the star in the form of a stellar wind . as a consequence",
    ", it seems unlikely that most massive stars will still have cores at the time of core collapse that rotate as rapidly as is required in the collapsar model ( heger , woosley & spruit 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , this is also not necessary , since it is clear that lgrbs are rare events , associated with less than 1 in 1000 core - collapse supernovae ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "one of the key unresolved questions is what are the special circumstances that produce lgrb progenitors : are these special conditions in single stars ( e.g. yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) or do they require particular binary channels ( e.g. fryer & woosley 1998 ; izzard , ramirez - ruiz & tout 2003 ; fryer & heger 2005 ; petrovic et al .",
    "2005 ; detmers et al.2006 ; fryer et al .  2006 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "one of the major problems in many of these models is that mass loss , both in the red - supergiant phase and , in particular , in the wolf - rayet phase , leads to very efficient angular - momentum loss . since these wind",
    "mass - loss rates are dependent on the metallicity ( typically @xmath153 ; e.g. vink & de koter 2005 ) , massive stars with lower metallicity are more likely to have rapidly rotating cores at the time of core collapse .",
    "this is a generic advantage for many of the proposed models , both single and binary .",
    "specifically , yoon & langer ( 2005 ) and woosley & heger ( 2006 ) recently proposed that a low - metallicity , very rapidly rotating star may evolve essentially homogeneously during its early evolutionary phases and may avoid a red - supergiant phase altogether , in which most of the angular - momentum loss from the core tends to take place . as a consequence , these stars would still preserve rapidly rotating cores at the time of collapse , fulfilling one of the key conditions in the collapsar model . similarly , in some of the most promising binary scenarios , in which two massive stars ( almost ) merge or interact tidally , it is advantageous or even necessary that this occurs late in the evolution of one of the stars , i.e. after helium core burning ( so - called case c mass transfer ) .",
    "the range of masses for which case c mass transfer occurs and allows the formation of a black hole is a strong , non - linear function of metallicity ( justham et al .",
    "2006 ) , again favouring low - metallicity progenitors .",
    "as this discussion illustrates , the dependence of the lgrb rate on host metallicity can provide an important constraint on the various proposed progenitor models .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite have estimated that , when the effects of magnetic fields are included , the single , low - metallicity , high - rotation model @xcite requires a metallicity less than 1/5th solar .",
    "this already appears inconsistent with the constraints derived in this paper , which seem to rule out any models that _ require _ a metallicity significantly less than 1/2 solar .",
    "the ongoing metallicity _ calibration debate _ might render our limit to lie @xmath154  dex lower , if @xmath9-based methods were correct .",
    "there are now explorations of a third method for measuring metallicities , the o  ii@xmath155 method @xcite , which is aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of both previous methods .",
    "early results indicate that this method gives values in between the two debated versions , but closer to the @xmath8 method .",
