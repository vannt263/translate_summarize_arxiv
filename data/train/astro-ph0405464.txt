    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) have received increasing attention in the past several years ( e.g. , heise et al .",
    "2002 ; kippen et al .",
    "2002 ) . in many respects ,",
    "xrfs are similar to `` classical '' gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) : ( 1 ) their sky distribution is nearly isotropic ; ( 2 ) the red - shift @xmath2 of xrf 020903 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2003 ) and afterglows of xrf 020903 and xrf 030723 have been detected ( soderberg et al . 2002 ; prigozhin et al .",
    "2003 ) , which suggests that xrfs are also cosmic events ; ( 3 ) they have @xmath3 durations ranging from 20 to 200 seconds ; ( 4 ) their spectrum can also be fitted by the band spectrum ( kippen et al . 2002 ) ; ( 5 ) they have the temporal structure which is very similar to the x - ray counterparts of grbs ( heise et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , their spectral peak energies @xmath4 are much lower than that of grbs ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these similarities lead to the suggestion that xrfs are the extension of grbs and x - ray rich grbs to even softer regime ( kippen et al .",
    "2002 ; lamb , donaghy & graziani 2004 ) .",
    "now there are several models proposed to account for xrfs , i.e. , the off - beam uniform jet model ( e.g. , ioka & nakamura 2001 ; yamazaki , ioka & nakamura 2002 ) ; the wide opening angle uniform jet model ( e.g. , lamb et al .",
    "2004 ) ; the gaussian jet model ( e.g. , zhang & mszros 2002a ; lloyd - ronning et al . 2004",
    "; zhang et al .",
    "2004a ) ; the power - law jet model ( e.g. , mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ; jin & wei 2004 ) ; the two component jet model ( e.g. , zhang , woosley & heger 2004 ; huang et al .",
    "2004 ) and the cannon - ball model ( dado , dar & de rugula 2003 ) .    in this letter , instead of taking a further insight into these models",
    ", we turn to calculate the possible accompanying very early afterglows .",
    "we are mostly incited by the upcoming swift satellite , which carries three main telescopes  the burst alert telescope ( bat ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ) .",
    "the energy range of bat is 15 - 150 kev .",
    "considering its high sensitivity , xrfs with not too much lower peak energies can be detected as well as grbs .",
    "bat will observe and locate hundreds of bursts per year to better than 4 arc minutes accuracy .",
    "using this prompt burst location information , swift can slew quickly to point on - board xrt and uvot at the burst for continued afterglow studies .",
    "the spacecraft s 20@xmath670 seconds time - to - target means that about @xmath7100 grbs+xrfs per year ( about 1/3 of the total ) will be observed by the narrow field instruments during the gamma ray emission .",
    "the uvot is sensitive to magnitude 24 in a 1000 seconds exposure ( for a linear increasing of the sensitivity with the exposure time , that means a sensitivity of magnitude 19 in a 10 seconds exposure ) .",
    "then , though the very early afterglow of xrfs may be dimmer than that of grbs , they can be detected directly . ) at a time @xmath8 after the main burst of xrf 030723 has been reported ( smith et al .",
    "in the standard fireball model for gamma - ray bursts , the very early afterglow of grbs powered by the ejecta interacting with the interstellar medium ( ism ) or stellar wind has been discussed in great detail ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ; kobayashi 2000 ; li et al .",
    "2003 ; nakar & piran 2004 ; wu et al . 2003 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003a ) .",
    "recently , the reverse shock ( rs ) emission powered by magnetized outflows ",
    "medium interaction has been discussed by fan , wei & wang ( 2004 ) and zhang & kobayashi ( 2004 ) independently .",
    "so far there are three very early afterglows having been detected ( see sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003b ; wei 2003 and the references therein ) . with the launching of swift , that number may be increased greatly .    modelling the very early afterglow",
    "can be used to constrain some poorly known physical parameters , such as the initial lorentz factor of the outflow , @xmath9 ( the fraction of the internal energy converted into magnetic energy ) and so on ( e.g. , wang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , it is found that the rs emission regions of grb 990123 and grb 021211 are likely to be magnetized ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang , kobayashi & mszros 2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ) .",
    "one of obstacles we encountered in the current work is the poorly known angular distribution of the initial lorentz factor of these jets except the off - beam one .",
    "kumar & granot ( 2003 ) have performed a numerical investigation on the hydrodynamical evolution of a gaussian jet by assuming @xmath10 is also gaussian distribution . however , if the viewed lorentz factor @xmath11 is significantly lower than 100 and xrfs are powered by internal shocks , the observed spectrum should be thermal , which is inconsistent with the current observation . in their monte carlo simulation , zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have taken @xmath10 as a free function but found that a flat ( or at most slightly variable ) angular distribution of lorentz factor is indeed required to interpret the current observations , particularly , the empirical relationship @xmath12 . therefore , and partly for convenience , we assume @xmath13 .",
    "for the off - beam jet model , xrfs are intrinsically the grbs . as usual , we take @xmath14 .    in this work , we assume @xmath13 for all on - beam jets ( i.e. , the gaussian jet , the power - law jet , the wide opening jet and the two component jet ) .",
    "different from the off - beam one , for these four type jets , there are relativistically moving materials beaming towards the observer .",
    "as long as the lorentz factor is large enough , within the @xmath15 cone the jet structure effect is not significant , all these four models would give a rather similar early afterglow lightcurves .",
    "their differences would only appear in much later epochs when the jet - structure effect becomes prominent .",
    "so , for an illustrative purpose , in this letter , only the possible rs emission powered by the gaussian jet and the off - axis jet interacting with ism have been calculated .      for a uniform jet ,",
    "if the line of sight is slightly beyond the cone , i.e. , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the opening angle of jet , @xmath18 is our viewing angle to the jet ) , the observed peak energy decreases as @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the observed frequency on / off - axis respectively , @xmath21^{-1}$ ] ( e.g. , granot et al . 2002 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the observed duration is increased by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "then a `` classical '' grb will be detected as a long lasting xrf ( e.g. , ioka & nakamura 2001 ; yamazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) . by assuming an accompanying supernova , it is claimed that the off - beam jet model can fit the later afterglow of xrf 030723 quite well ( fynbo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the afterglow of off - beam jet has been numerical calculated by many authors , and an empirical formula has been proposed to estimate the observed flux ( e.g. , granot et al .",
    "2002 ; jin & wei 2004 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "different from the long lasting forward shock ( fs ) , the rs disappears after it crosses the ejecta .",
    "the crossing time is estimated by @xmath25 , where two timescales are involved : ( i ) the deceleration time @xmath26 , which can be calculated as follows : the outflow is decelerated significantly at the deceleration radius ( rees & mszros 1992 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the typical isotropic energy of the grb outflow , @xmath29 is the number density of the ism , @xmath30 is the initial lorentz factor of the outflow at the end of @xmath31ray emission phase . throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt the convention @xmath32 for expressing the physical parameters , using cgs units . at @xmath33 , the lorentz factor of the outflow drops to @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding timescale is @xmath35    \\(ii ) @xmath36 , the local duration of the grb corresponding to the xrf , can be estimated as follows : in the off - beam jet model of xrfs , the observed duration of xrf is @xmath37 , where @xmath38^{-1}$ ] .",
    "here we take @xmath39for much smaller @xmath40 , the observed luminosity ( @xmath41 ) is too dim to be detected ; for much larger @xmath40 , the observed peak energy ( @xmath42 ) is in the hard x - ray energy , i.e. , what we observed is x - ray rich burst rather than xrf .",
    "one potential problem of the off - beam model is that , in principle , the typical duration of xrfs should be tens times of that of typical grbs  which has not been supported by the present observations ( the observed duration of the xrfs ranging from 20 s to 200 s ) .",
    "here we take @xmath43 , which matches that of the `` classical '' long grbs ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the typical red - shift of grbs ) .    for @xmath46 ,",
    "the shell is thin , otherwise the shell is thick ( sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi 2000 ) . for the parameters taken here",
    ", we have @xmath46 , so the shell is thin ( if the shell is thick , the following discussion is invalid and we refer the reader to see @xmath47 for detailed treatment ) . consequently , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow at @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the corresponding radius ) .",
    "the lorentz factor of the shocked outflow relative to the initial one is @xmath54 which suggests that the rs is only mildly relativistic .    at @xmath53 ,",
    "all the electrons contained in the outflow have been heated by the rs and distribute as @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( throughout this letter we take @xmath57 ) , where the `` minimal '' thermal lorentz factor , @xmath58 , can be estimated by @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the fraction of thermal energy obtained by the electrons , @xmath62 are the rest mass of proton ( electron ) respectively .",
    "the typical synchrotron radiation frequency can be estimated by @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( e.g. , fan et al . 2002 ) is the magnetic strength generated in the rs .",
    "here we take @xmath65 rather than 0.01 since the ejecta is likely to be magnetized ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al .",
    "the cooling lorentz factor of the shocked electrons is ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 , hereafter spn ) @xmath66 ( assuming the involved @xmath67 ) , where @xmath68 is the thompson cross section . correspondingly , the cooling frequency is @xmath69 . for @xmath70 ( as it is general suggested for xrfs ) , @xmath71 is larger than the observer frequency @xmath72 .",
    "following wu et al .",
    "( 2003 ; see their appendix a1 for detail ) , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency of the compressed outflow is @xmath73 ( assuming the involved @xmath67 ) .",
    "so the synchrotron self - absorption effect can not significantly change the r band spectrum , which is of our interest .    at @xmath53 ,",
    "the on - beam peak flux can be estimated by @xmath74 ( spn ) , where @xmath75 is the total number of electrons contained in the outflow , @xmath76 is the luminosity distance ( we assume @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) . with equation ( 2 ) , the off - axis observed energy flux can be estimated by ( spn ) @xmath82 where @xmath83^{-1}$ ] .",
    "if we take @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 ( see the reasons mentioned in the paragraph below equation ( [ eq : tdec ] ) ) , we have @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 . the observed crossing time @xmath88 . at r band , the magnitude @xmath89 , which is bright enough to be detected by the telescopes on work today , or the upcoming uvot .    here , we briefly discuss the observed very early afterglow light curve . in the case of thin shell , the on - axis light curve is well approximated by ( for @xmath90 , i.e. , the slow cooling case ) @xmath91 the light curve for @xmath92 is presented in mszros & rees ( 1999 ; assuming the comoving magnetic field contained in the shocked outflow is freezing and taking @xmath93 , since for the parameters adopted in this letter , the fs emission is in fast cooling ) . the light curve for @xmath94 adopted here is slightly different from that of kobayashi ( 2000 ) and fan et al .",
    "below we derive it in some detail . for the newtonian rs , the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( sari & piran 1995 ) , where @xmath97 is the comoving number density of the outflow , @xmath98 is the radius of the outflow .",
    "therefore @xmath99 , substituting it into equation ( 7 ) we have @xmath100 . on the other hand , @xmath101 , which results in @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the number of shocked electrons . substituting these relations into the expression of @xmath104 , we have @xmath105",
    ". therefore the observed r band light curve @xmath106 .    assuming @xmath107 for @xmath108",
    ", we have @xmath109t$ ] ; for @xmath92 , @xmath110 , we have @xmath111t$ ] . with these relations ( including eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) and ( [ eq : l1 ] ) ) , we obtain one sample light curve of the rs emission powered by the off - beam uniform jet ",
    "ism interaction , which has been presented in figure 1 ( the solid line ) . naturally , for @xmath112 , the increasing of the light curve is more rapidly than @xmath113 . for @xmath114 ,",
    "as long as @xmath115 is not much smaller than 1 , the factor @xmath116 increases rapidly .",
    "therefore , at early time , the optical emission increases , rather than decreases with time .",
    "at much later time , @xmath117 , the factor @xmath116 increases only slightly .",
    "so the light curve of rs emission drops as @xmath118 ( figure 1 , the thin solid line ) .    taking @xmath119 , @xmath120 ( the subscript @xmath121 represents the forward shock )",
    ", we have : at @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "for @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( e.g. , spn ) . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) and @xmath126t$ ] , the sample early light curve of the fs emission has been presented in figure 1 ( the dotted line ) .",
    "( 20,180 ) ( 0,0 )      for a gaussian jet , the observed isotropic energy @xmath127 .",
    "typically , the observed peak energy of xrf is about 0.03 times that of grbs and @xmath128 .",
    "the corresponding viewing angle is @xmath129 .",
    "taking @xmath130 , equation ( 3 ) gives @xmath131 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath132 , which is much shorter than the typical duration of the xrfs @xmath133 , i.e. , _ the shell is thick_. so , locally @xmath134 , with which @xmath53 and @xmath51 can be calculated self - consistently .    at @xmath53 , the energy conservation of the system , i.e. , the shocked ism and the shocked viewing outflow , gives @xmath135 where @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) is the mass of the viewed ejecta ( the swept ism ) . in the thick shell case ,",
    "the rs is mild - relativistic and @xmath138 .",
    "now equation ( 10 ) reduces to @xmath139 .",
    "considering that @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we have @xmath142 @xmath143 now @xmath144 , which is mild - relativistic .",
    "so the assumption made before is reasonable .",
    "similar to section 3.1 , the typical frequency of rs emission can be estimated by @xmath145 where @xmath146 . similarly , taking @xmath67 and @xmath70 we have @xmath147 . following wu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency is @xmath148 .",
    "therefore both of them can not affect the r band spectrum significantly .",
    "the peak flux of rs emission can be estimated by @xmath149 .",
    "then the observed peak energy flux can be estimated by ( spn ) @xmath150 the magnitude @xmath151 , which is also bright enough to be detected by the upcoming uvot or the telescopes on work today , as long as the response to the xrf is fast enough . in the case of thick shell ,",
    "the very early light curve of a standard fireball takes the form ( for the parameters adopted in this letter , the reverse / fs emission are all in slow cooling , for @xmath92 ) . @xmath152",
    "thanks to the beaming effect , these scaling laws may be applied to the current work as well . here",
    "we simply take equation ( 15 ) to plot the sample very early light curve powered by gaussian jet ",
    "ism interaction ( see figure 1 , the thick dash line ) .",
    "the corresponding light curve of the fs emission ( see figure 1 , the thick dash - dotted line ) is plotted as follows : following spn , at @xmath153 , @xmath154 . for @xmath155 , @xmath156 ( where @xmath157 is determined by @xmath158 ) ; for @xmath159 , @xmath160 .    as shown in figure 1 , in many respects , i.e. , the peak time and the temporal behavior , the current light curve is much different from that powered by the off - beam jet ",
    "ism interaction , which may help us to distinguish them . for example , the fs peak emission of the off - beam jet is much brighter than that of gaussian jet , which is mainly due to : in the off - beam jet model , we take @xmath161 . at several thousand seconds after the main burst , the ejecta has been decelerated significantly ( @xmath162 ) , as a result , the beaming effect is not important .",
    "so the viewed isotropic energy of the `` off - beam '' ejecta is nearly @xmath163 , which is much larger than that of the gaussian jet model ( @xmath164)in which @xmath165 ( zhang et al .",
    "2004 ) , the emission powered by the central energetic ejecta can not be observed at early time as long as @xmath166 .",
    "in the past several years , xrfs have received more and more attentions , but their nature remains unknown . considering the similarity between xrfs and grbs on duration , temporal structure , spectrum and so on , these bursts may be the same phenomenon . the different peak energy as well as the peak energy flux may be just due to our different viewing angles to them .",
    "this viewpoint has been supported by the recent detection of two afterglows and one red - shift of xrfs . however ,",
    "there are more than 6 models have been proposed to explain the xrfs . some of them ( for example , the gaussian jet model , the off - beam uniform jet model ) work well on explaining the current observation . perhaps only the detailed multi - wavelength afterglows modelling ( including the very early afterglow discussed in this letter ) can provide us a reliable identification on them .    with two current leading models , in this letter , the very early rs emission of xrfs",
    "have been analytically investigated .",
    "as xrfs are much dimmer than grbs , the predicted very early r band afterglow of xrfs is dimmer than those of grbs . but some of them , if not all , are still bright enough to be detected by rotse - iii on work today or by the upcoming swift mission .",
    "the actual results are model dependent , which may in turn provide us a chance to see which one is better , if the very early afterglow of xrfs has been really detected . one thing",
    "should be emphasized here is that the predicted r band flux is sensitive to the initial lorentz factor , i.e. , @xmath167 .",
    "so , if @xmath168 rather than 150 taken in this letter , the resulting very early optical emission will be much dimmer .    as realized by more and more `` grb people '' , modelling the very early afterglow of grbs can impose some stringent constraint on the fundamental physical parameters of the outflow such as the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ; wang et al .",
    "2000 ) , or help to see whether the outflows are magnetized or not ( e.g. , fan et al . 2002 ; zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ; fan et al . 2004b",
    "; zhang & kobayashi 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , the rs emission powered by the ejecta  stellar wind interaction is much different from that powered by the ejecta ",
    "ism interaction ( e.g. , wu et al . 2003 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003a ; fan et al .",
    "therefore the very early afterglow observation can provide us an independent chance to determine the environment where the `` classical '' grb was born in . in principle , interstellar wind environment may be common , and the predicted very early r band emission is very strong ( @xmath169 or even brighter ) .",
    "so far there are only three very early afterglow having been reported .",
    "all of them can be well fitted by the ejecta ",
    "ism interaction model ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003b ; wei 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , in this letter only the ejecta ",
    "ism interaction case has been investigated .",
    "fortunately , it is straightforward to extend our treatment to the wind case .",
    "anyway , the importance of modelling the very early afterglow of grbs can be applied to that of xrfs as well .    in this letter ,",
    "the possible pair loading during the @xmath170/x - ray burst phase has not been taken into account .",
    "at least for the off - beam uniform jet model , during the initial @xmath31ray emission phase , large amount of electrons / positrons may be created .",
    "the annihilation time scale is long and most of generated pairs can not be annihilated locally .",
    "these pairs will be heated by the rs , too ( li et al . 2003 , and the references therein ) . without doubt , the rs emission has been significantly softened .",
    "but , as argued by fan , dai & lu ( 2004 ) , the r band emission may be not",
    ". this can be easily understood , if there are @xmath171 times electrons / positrons of that associated with the baryons , current @xmath172 would be @xmath173 . on the other hand , current @xmath174 would be @xmath175 .",
    "then , in the slow cooling case , current @xmath176 should be @xmath177 . for @xmath178 ,",
    "such dependence is far from sensitive . in other models for xrfs , during the x - ray emission phase",
    ", at least in the viewed area , the possible pair loading process is unimportant and can be ignored safely .",

    "<S> in the past two years , tremendous progresses to understand x - ray flashes have been made . </S>",
    "<S> now it is widely believed that x - ray flashes and gamma - ray bursts are intrinsically the same , their much different peak energy and flux may be just due to our different viewing angles to them . here </S>",
    "<S> we analytically calculate the very early afterglow of x - ray flashes , i.e. , the reverse shock emission powered by the outflows interacting with the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath0 , we have shown that typically the r band flux of reverse shock emission can be bright to @xmath1th magnitude ( the actual values are model dependent and sensitive to the initial lorentz factor of the viewed ejecta ) . that emission is bright enough to be detected by the telescope on work today such as rotse - iii or the upcoming uvot carried by swift satellite , planned for launching in later 2004 .    </S>",
