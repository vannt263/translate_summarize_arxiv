    "the tully - fisher relation ( tfr , tully & fisher 1977 ) between disk galaxy luminosities and rotational velocities is an essential diagnostic of galaxy evolution . by comparing galaxy evolution models to tfr observations at @xmath3 through @xmath4 , it is possible to probe dark matter halo properties and galaxy star formation histories ( e.g. , mo & mao 2000 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; ferreras & silk 2001 ; buchalter , jimenez & kamionkowski 2001a , 2001b ; mo & mao 2004 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) find evidence for 1.52 mag brightening at @xmath7 .",
    "these two studies , however , also hint that there may be a change in tfr slope with redshift .",

    "( 2002 ) and bhm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have provided further evidence for evolution in tfr slope , possibly reconciling previous findings .",
    "more specifically , their work indicates that the mass - to - light ratios of the least massive galaxies evolve most strongly .",
    "these authors attribute the differing results of previous studies to selection effects and small sample sizes .",
    "their results are consistent with kinematic studies of blue compact galaxies at @xmath10 ( koo et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; phillips et al .  1997 ; guzmn et al .  1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the latter studies demonstrate that distant compact galaxies are overluminous as compared to the local tfr , in many cases an order of magnitude less massive than expected for their luminosities .    while the work done to date",
    "is promising , there are still ways in which distant tully - fisher studies can be improved .",
    "for instance , selection effects are thought to be responsible for the differing results of some of the studies mentioned above . however , while effects such as magnitude incompleteness have been explored in local studies ( e.g. willick 1994 , giovanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , little work has yet been done toward quantifying and correcting for such effects on distant samples .",
    "furthermore , the velocity measurement techniques used in local and distant tully - fisher studies are often very different and may account for some of the discrepancies between previous results .",
    "authors of distant tully - fisher studies also tend to compare their samples to the relatively small local sample of pierce & tully ( 1992 ) to draw evolutionary conclusions .",
    "while this is a good starting point , larger and better - calibrated local samples now exist for comparison ( e.g. , tully & pierce 2000 ; kannappan , fabricant & franx 2002 ) .",
    "we also note that while significant recent progress has been made investigating the evolution of the tully - fisher relation in the field , tfr evolution in the cluster environment is only beginning to be explored .",
    "many physical processes are expected to affect galaxies in this dense environment , including tidal encounters , interactions with the intracluster medium , and group infall .",
    "all of these processes are predicted to affect cluster galaxy disks and gas , and in particular their mass - to - light ratios , thus affecting the tfr .    as a specific example",
    ", high - velocity tidal encounters between cluster galaxies and with the gravitational potential of the cluster itself (  harassment \" ) have been modeled by moore et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "these encounters are expected to increase star formation rates while stripping galaxies of a significant fraction of their mass ( fujita 1998 ) , thus decreasing their mass - to - light ratios .",
    "gnedin ( 2003 ) predicts that lower - density galaxies in clusters are more likely to be disrupted and lose a greater percentage of mass in tidal encounters than large spirals .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of low- and high - mass galaxies in clusters may therefore evolve differently .",
    "in distant galaxy clusters , we have the opportunity to observe such evolutionary processes in action .",
    "distant cluster tully - fisher studies will therefore allow us to test model predictions and quantify evolutionary effects .",
    "few studies of the tully - fisher relation in distant clusters currently exist . while studies of @xmath11 clusters have been conducted with significant sample sizes ( @xmath1250 galaxies ; e.g. , rubin et al .  1999 ,",
    "dale & uson 2003 ) , kinematics of few @xmath13 cluster disks have been measured . in a pioneering study , vogt et al .",

    "( 2005 ) have expanded this study with a larger sample size of 22 members of three clusters at @xmath20 .",

    "( 2003 ; see jger et al .",
    "2004 for details on analysis techniques ) , presented rotation curves of 13 members of three clusters at @xmath21 and found no evidence for luminosity evolution of cluster galaxies with respect to the field .",
    "other than these noteable exceptions , the majority of kinematic studies in distant clusters have focused on the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies .",
    "these works indicate that the amount of luminosity evolution in cluster early - types is consistent with passive evolution out to @xmath22 ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ; kelson et al .",
    "1997 , 2000a , b ; j@xmath23rgensen et al .",
    "1999 ) and possibly out to @xmath24 ( van dokkum & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "as described above , environmentally - dependent physical processes are expected to affect cluster disks more strongly than early - types .",
    "the distant cluster tfr may provide clues as to which processes are dominant . as a first step ,",
    "we have chosen to study the tfr in rich cluster cl0024 + 1654 at @xmath0 , where evolutionary processes are very likely to be apparent .",
    "in general , morphological , luminosity , and color evolution have already been seen in cluster galaxies since @xmath25 ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1997 , j@xmath23rgensen et al .  1999 , and butcher & oemler 1984 , respectively ) .",
    "the redshift of this cluster alone places it at an epoch where we would expect to observe evolutionary signatures .",
    "cl0024 was one of the two clusters originally studied by butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) and thus has long been known to have a high fraction of blue , presumably star - forming members .",
    "furthermore , evidence has been found for evolutionary processes such as mergers ( lavery , pierce , & mcclure 1992 ) and recent subcluster infall ( czoske et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper runs as follows : in the next section , we discuss our observations of cl0024 + 1654 and our sample selection for this study .",
    "note that our sample of 15 cl0024 members is one of the largest samples of rotation curves presented thus far for galaxies within a single @xmath26 cluster .",
    "we detail our basic spectral and image reductions , two methods of rotation curve analysis , and we discuss the differences between local and distant galaxy velocity measurements in  3 . in  4 , we present the cl0024 tully - fisher relation , including a comparison to three local samples . in  5 ,",
    "we discuss evolutionary indications from correlations between tully - fisher residuals and other galaxy properties .",
    "we also take a look at the effect of magnitude incompleteness on our analysis .",
    "we present our conclusions in  6 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath27 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "using this cosmology , one arcsecond corresponds to 5.332 kpc .",
    "we present all photometry in the vega system .",
    "spectra of all galaxies presented in this paper were taken as part of a larger spectral survey of cl0024 + 1654 ( metevier et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "survey observations were made in september 1995 , september 1997 , and september 2001 with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck 10-m telescopes .",
    "all cl0024 spectra were taken through multi - object slitmasks with slit widths of @xmath31 .",
    "a variety of gratings ( 400 , 600 , 900 , and 1200 lines / mm ) and settings were used such that dispersions range from @xmath32    pixel@xmath28 ( corresponding to @xmath1930 - 80 km s@xmath28 pixel@xmath28 ) , and wavelength ranges cover at least h@xmath2 ( 9155 , observed ) through h@xmath33 ( 6780 , observed ) and in some cases [ ] ( 5200 , observed ) at the cluster redshift .",
    "the spatial resolution of all spectra in our survey is 0.215@xmath34 pixel@xmath28 .",
    "seeing ranged from @xmath35 fwhm , and instrumental resolution ran from 1.0 to 2.9   fwhm ( 40 to 120 km s@xmath28 ) .",
    "in many cases , slits were approximately aligned with galaxy major axes .",
    "slit misalignments have been explicitly included in our rotation curve analysis .",
    "archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) images of cl0024 were taken with wfpc2 as part of two programs .",
    "deep imaging of a single pointing at the center of the cluster was taken ( proposal 5453 , pi turner ) to study the mass of the cluster via strong lensing .",
    "exposure times are 25.2 ksec and 19.8 ksec in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "more recently , shallower ( 4.0 - 4.4 ksec ) images of the outer regions of the cluster have been taken in @xmath37 ( proposal 8559 , pi ellis ) for a weak lensing study .",
    "the latter program provides imaging of 39 non - contiguous pointings covering a circle of radius @xmath1915 arcmin , with a filling factor of approximately 50% .",
    "discrepancies between the results of tully - fisher studies of distant field galaxies have generally been attributed to different sample selections .",
    "we have imposed very few selection criteria here : we have restricted our tully - fisher sample to emission line cluster members with @xmath38 , and we have required that the galaxies in this sample lie within the hst - imaged region of the cluster .",
    "high - resolution wfpc2 images are essential to our structural analysis for galaxy disk sizes , inclinations , and position angles . in turn , these measurements are crucial for kinematic analysis .",
    "we have also required disk inclination angles range between @xmath39 .",
    "these simple selection criteria narrowed the original sample of 312 total objects in our survey to 44 cluster members eligible for tully - fisher analysis .",
    "note that we have not intentionally imposed selection based on colors , morphologies , or emission line strengths .",
    "only 15 of the 44 objects in our tully - fisher - eligible sample have extended , high signal - to - noise emission lines such that we were able to measure a reliable terminal rotation velocity .",
    "this low success rate imposes additional selection on top of the criteria described above .",
    "we explore these selection effects further in figure 1 , where we compare the @xmath40 magnitudes , @xmath41 colors , morphological types ( from treu et al .",
    "2003 ) , bulge - to - total flux ratios ( b / t ) , and disk scale lengths of galaxies in the tully - fisher and larger cluster samples .",
    "in addition , in figure 2 , we present the distributions of emission line extents and projected cluster - centric distances for the galaxies in the final tully - fisher sample ( 15 galaxies ) and the tully - fisher - eligible sample ( 44 galaxies ) .",
    "emission line extents were measured in the spatial direction along each galaxy s spectrum from the top to the bottom of the galaxy s emission , as some galaxies do not exhibit symmetric emission about the galaxy centroid .",
    "we estimate that the errors on the extent measurements are on the order of one pixel ( @xmath42 ) . in tables 1 and 2 , we quantify the mean values , standard deviations , minimum and maximum values of the compared properties for the different galaxy samples .    in general , we find that the galaxies in our tully - fisher sample are relatively bright and blue as compared to the other emission - line cluster members and the total cluster sample .",
    "furthermore , they tend to be large , late - type , disk - dominated systems .",
    "galaxies in the final tully - fisher and tully - fisher - eligible samples are similarly distributed within the cluster .",
    "however , galaxies in the final sample have the largest emission line extents .",
    "we are therefore mindful of the fact that cl0024 members with suppressed or centrally concentrated star formation , perhaps due to physical processes within the cluster , are likely not included in our tully - fisher study . in table 3",
    ", we give basic data for the final sample of 15 cl0024 members with reliable rotation curve measurements .",
    "we reduced all lris spectra using python modules developed by d.  kelson ( see kelson et al .",
    "2000 , kelson 2003 ) . to prepare the spectra for this reduction , we performed overscan subtraction using standard iraf procedures , and we cosmic ray reduced the frames with a task written by coauthor l.  simard . using python modules ,",
    "each spectrum and dome flat was rectified in the dispersion direction to account for  pincushion \"- shaped distortion introduced by lris optics .",
    "we then combined dome flat fields ; dome flats from two of the three runs were taken with the same grating angles and telescope elevation and azimuth as were used during the object exposures in order to reproduce and combat the effects of fringing .",
    "the resulting combined flats were used to correct for pixel - to - pixel variations in two dimensions . along the length of the slit ,",
    "the flats were also used to correct for instrumental distortions and variations in slit width .",
    "we then rectified the spectra in the spatial direction and wavelength calibrated against arc lamp exposures and known night sky lines . we sky - subtracted the resulting spectra , then co - added multiple exposures , accounting for sub - pixel offsets in the spatial direction . finally , we made redshift measurements using cross - correlation software developed by coauthor a.  c.  phillips .",
    "we obtained pipeline - processed wfpc2 images from the canadian astronomy data centre archive service .",
    "remaining reduction consisted of cosmic ray removal and structural modeling of galaxies in the images . to remove cosmic rays , we combined exposures of the cluster core , which were taken with no offsets .",
    "exposures of the outer regions of the cluster had subpixel offsets and were therefore individually treated using the lacosmic routine ( van dokkum 2001 ) .",
    "we fit a two - dimensional devaucouleurs bulge @xmath43 exponential disk model to each galaxy using gim2d ( simard et al .",
    "this analysis provided galaxy bulge - to - total flux ratios ( b / ts ) and disk inclinations , scale lengths , and position angles .",
    "these measurements are noted in table 3 .",
    "measuring the rotation velocities of distant galaxies from optical spectra is a challenging undertaking which requires comparison of emission line data to emission line models . in part",
    "this is because by @xmath44 , the size of a typical galaxy ( @xmath191@xmath34 ) is roughly equivalent to the size of the seeing disk and the slit width .",
    "therefore , light and velocity information from a substantial fraction of a galaxy are gathered in its spectrum .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is far from the optimal narrow slice down the galaxy major axis acquired in long slit studies of nearby galaxies .",
    "below we provide a more complete list of factors one must consider when converting raw emission line measurements into maximum disk rotation velocities for distant galaxies :    1 .   spatial distribution of observable galaxy emission 2 .",
    "velocity distribution of observable galaxy emission 3 .",
    "inclination of the disk 4 .   seeing blurring of the observed velocity distribution 5 .",
    "instrumental blurring of observed emission due to instrument optics 6 .",
    "slit width with respect to the size of the galaxy 7 .",
    "slit position angle with respect to the galaxy semi - major axis 8 .",
    "slit position with respect to the galaxy center 9 .",
    "anamorphic de - magnification in the spectral direction 10 .",
    "pixelization of the observed emission line 11 .",
    "atmospheric dispersion 12 .",
    "thickness of the disk 13 . presence of bulge , bar , warps    previous studies of distant galaxies have mainly used one of two techniques for deriving velocities from rotation curves .",
    "these two techniques are 1 ) comparison of velocity measurements from gaussian fits to observed and model emission lines at several spatial locations ( vogt et al .  1996 , 1997 ;",
    "rigopoulou et al .",
    "2002 ; ziegler et al .  2002 , 2003 ;",
    "bhm et al .",
    "2004 ; jger et al .",
    "2004 ) , and 2 ) direct comparison of two - dimensional information from observed and simulated emission lines ( simard & pritchet 1998 , 1999 ; milvang - jensen et al .  2003 ; bamford et al .  2005 ) .",
    "we have implemented both analysis methods in our study of cl0024 members ; below we refer to our version of method 1 as gauss2d and our implementation of method 2 as gelfit2d .",
    "both of our analysis techniques rely upon the same emission line modeling routine .",
    "the routine we have adopted assumes an infinitely thin , round disk galaxy with no bulge , bar , or warps .",
    "this model galaxy has a truncated exponential intensity profile and a symmetric",
    " step function \" ( e.g. , persic & salucci 1991 ) or an arctangent ( e.g. , willick 1999 ) velocity distribution .",
    "we found that both velocity functions yielded similar rotation velocity measurements ( generally within 10 km s@xmath28 ) for our sample .",
    "we therefore have chosen to use the arctangent function for this paper : @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the asymptotic rotation velocity , and @xmath47 is the  turnover \" radius which defines the slope of the inner velocity curve .",
    "we note that more elaborate empirical descriptions of galaxy velocity distributions may better fit observed rotation curves ( see , e.g. , courteau s 1997 study of nearby galaxies ) .",
    "they also introduce new parameters to be modeled and therefore we neglect them here .",
    "our emission line modeling routine first samples the assumed intensity and velocity distributions according to a grid size specified by the user . in order to sample at least 10 times across each galaxy , we generally subsampled above the resolution of our model data according to the following prescription , where _ pixscale _ is the spatial pixel scale of our data , @xmath48 is the disk scale length , and @xmath49 is the galaxy s inclination : @xmath50    the routine then convolves the model galaxy s light and velocity profiles with a circular gaussian seeing disk with a given fwhm .",
    "the seeing - degraded model galaxy is masked with a slit , taking into account the slit width as well as the position angle difference between the slit and galaxy major axis .",
    "the subpixel position of the galaxy center with respect to the center of the slit can also be accounted for ( as in gelfit2d ,  3.2.2 ) by varying the position of the model galaxy with respect to the model slit mask .",
    "the model galaxy is then compressed in the spatial direction due to the instrument anamorphic factor and further convolved with a circular gaussian representing blurring from instrumental optics .",
    "the resulting light and velocity profiles are rebinned and resampled to create a model emission line matching the resolution of the user s data .    in short ,",
    "while our emission line modeling routine makes some simplifying assumptions about the intensity and velocity distributions of emission within a galaxy ( items 1 and 2 on our list of modeling considerations above ) , it fully accounts for factors 3 through 10 . through the implementation discussed in  3.2.3 , atmospheric dispersion ( factor 11 )",
    "can also be accounted for .",
    "we note that disk thickness ( factor 12 ) has not been incorporated in rotation curve analysis techniques presented previously in the literature , nor is it considered here .",
    "similarly , the effects of a bulge , bar , and warps have not been incorporated in distant galaxy rotation curve analysis .",
    "another improvement that could be made in the future is the direct use of color images to model emission line intensity distribution , rather than the assumption of an exponential distribution .",
    "our gauss2d velocity analysis follows the method used by vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) , rigopoulou et al .  (",
    "2002 ) , ziegler et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) , bhm et al .  (",
    "2004 ) , and jger et al .  ( 2004 ) .",
    "we determined raw velocity measurements by fitting gaussian profiles to the strongest observed emission lines at each row along the slit .",
    "these fits provided gaussian amplitudes , centers , widths , and linear background measurements , with errors on each of the measurements .",
    "fits were required to meet certain criteria chosen to throw out noise peaks or measurements with unreliable s / n .",
    "these criteria were : gaussian amplitude @xmath51 counts , center @xmath52 in significance , and 1  @xmath53 fwhm @xmath53 20 .",
    "gaussian centers were converted to velocities and were required to differ no more than 100 km s@xmath28 from one of the neighboring measurements . generally , several emission lines were fit for each object ( double gaussians were fit to [ ] ) , and the resulting velocity information was converted to a single weighted mean and error at each row along the slit .",
    "to determine the rotation velocities of the galaxies in our sample , we applied the same gaussian fitting to emission lines modeled with a grid of @xmath46 and @xmath47 values .",
    "grids were initially implemented with @xmath46 ranging between 50 and 450 km s@xmath28 in 50 km s@xmath28 increments , and with @xmath47 ranging between 0.1 and 0.5  in 0.1  increments .",
    "we compared observed and model velocity distributions to create corresponding @xmath54 grids , then interpolated to determine the optimal @xmath46 and @xmath47 measurements ( corresponding to the minimum @xmath54 ) with 68% confidence intervals .",
    "this process was then repeated with more refined grids for each galaxy such that @xmath46 values were tested in increments of 10 km s@xmath28 , and @xmath47 in increments of 0.05 . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed model galaxies were centered in the slit when using this method .    in comparison with previous implementations of this analysis method",
    ", our version incorporates some improvements .",
    "the emission line models we use fully take into account factors 3  7 and 9  10 above ; it is unclear whether previous authors have considered anamorphic magnification ( 9 ) or pixelization ( 10 ) in their models .",
    "furthermore , gauss2d allows the option of simultaneously fitting multiple emission lines for a given galaxy .",
    "optimization of the measured velocity and confidence intervals are determined using a @xmath54 grid .",
    "we estimated further contributions to errors by varying the following four parameters : disk inclination and pa were each varied by @xmath55 , the seeing fwhm by @xmath56 , and the instrumental profile fwhm by @xmath57 pixels .",
    "we added the largest range of errors determined by varying these four parameters in quadrature with the formal fitting errors on our original measurements to derive a final set of errors on our @xmath46 and @xmath47 measurements .",
    "we note that previous studies ( e.g. , vogt 1996 , 1997 ) have only taken into account errors due to estimation of the inclination and position angle , beyond the formal fitting errors .",
    "our second rotation curve analysis method is very similar to the elfit2d analysis described in detail by simard & pritchet ( 1999 ) and used by simard & pritchet ( 1998 ) , milvang - jensen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and bamford et al .",
    "a metropolis optimization wrapper was applied to our emission modeling routine in order to directly compare observed and modeled emission lines , vary modeled parameters and determine best - fit values .",
    "( see below for a more detailed description of this optimization method . )",
    "specifically , this routine takes the following inputs : 1 ) a two - dimensional sky- and continuum - subtracted galaxy emission line  thumbnail image \" ; 2 ) an initial guess and range of possible values for each modeled parameter ; 3 ) a list of fixed parameter values .",
    "fixed parameters include the type of velocity field to be used in the emission line models ( arctangent or step function ) , seeing fwhm , observed wavelength of the emission line , an optional second observed wavelength ( e.g.  to be used in modeling the [ ] doublet ) , galaxy inclination , position angle between the slit and galaxy major axis , slit width , dispersion , spatial pixel scale , instrumental fwhm , a subsampling factor to account for pixelization , a sigma value describing the noise in the thumbnail image background , and the ccd gain .",
    "gelfit2d then optimizes the following eight parameters : @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ; @xmath58 , the emission line scale length ; @xmath59 , the inner truncation radius ( assuming a central hole in emission , e.g.  due to dust extinction ) ; offsets of the galaxy center with respect to the input thumbnail image of emisson along and across the slit ( can be subpixel ) ; and the offset of the slit with respect to the center of the thumbnail in the dispersion direction . in the case of [ oii ]",
    "emission , the flux ratio between the two lines in the observed doublet is also modeled .    to start the model , an initial grid of parameters within the user - specified range of possible values",
    "is first created .",
    "the corresponding emission line models are compared to the input data image by calculation of the likelihood function for each model .",
    "the most likely initial model is then chosen as a starting point for optimization .",
    "the metropolis algorithm ( metropolis et al .",
    "1953 , saha & williams 1994 ) is used to refine the best - fit parameter values .",
    "this algorithm generates random perturbations about the initial model parameter values .",
    "the size of these perturbations is controlled by the metropolis  temperature \" : if a model is hot , the perturbations are large ; if the model is cold , small perturbations are tried . at each iteration ,",
    "the likelihood that the new set of parameter values is correct , p@xmath60 , is calculated .",
    "this likelihood is compared to that of the previous iteration , p@xmath61 .",
    "the new trial is adopted if p@xmath62 p@xmath61 . if on the other hand p@xmath63 p@xmath61 , the new trial is still adopted p@xmath60/p@xmath61 of the time .",
    "this allows the algorithm to walk itself out of local @xmath54 minima , a particularly important feature for low signal - to - noise data .",
    "furthermore , the shallower the minimum , the higher the probability that the model will walk itself out .",
    "convergence is achieved when the difference between two likelihood values separated by 100 iterations is less than @xmath64 of the likelihood value fluctuations .",
    "once the metropolis algorithm converges , gelfit2d determines 68% confidence intervals by monte - carlo sampling the parameter space where the likelihood has been maximized . in other words",
    ", gelfit2d does not assume that confidence intervals are gaussian .",
    "this is again important in the case of low signal - to - noise data .",
    "the optimization algorithm employed in gelfit2d has also been used in the galaxy structural modeling routine gim2d ; see simard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for more details .",
    "gelfit2d outputs a log file specifying best - fit parameter values with errors as well as a thumbnail image of the best - fit model emission line and a residual ( data  best - fit model ) image .",
    "since gelfit2d does not allow for simultaneous fitting of multiple emission lines , we fit several lines separately for each galaxy , then took the weighted mean as our final gelfit2d velocity measurement .",
    "we determined contributions to the errors on our @xmath46 and @xmath47 measurements by varying disk inclinations and pas , as well as the seeing and instrumental fwhms , and adding the largest range of resulting errors in quadrature with the formal weighted errors from our original measurements , as described at the end of  3.2.1 .",
    "our implementation of gelfit2d incorporates some improvements over the similar elfit2d routine . specifically , gelfit2d accounts for considerations 3  10 on our modeling list , and provides some further flexibility in our assumptions regarding consideration 1 by allowing for a central hole in the emission intensity distribution .",
    "gelfit2d , unlike elfit2d , explicitly takes into account the position angle offset between the slit and galaxy major axis as well as possible offsets of the slit center with respect to the galaxy centroid .",
    "however , we note that elfit2d does have some advantages over gelfit2d , the most noteable being the option to specify an empirical seeing psf and instrumental profile rather than assuming circular gaussian profiles .",
    "images and two - dimensional emission lines , as well as output from both of our rotation curve analysis techniques are shown in figure 3 .",
    "gauss2d and gelfit2d share the same emission line modeling routine and are therefore not completely independent . however , they differ in two significant ways : 1 ) the routines use different methods for comparing observed and model emission lines , and 2 ) the optimization routines used to converge on a best - fit model are different .",
    "both routines have advantages and disadvantages that may affect our measurements , and we list them here .",
    "our gauss2d fitting routine has two distinct advantages .",
    "for one , it depends little on any assumption about the spatial light profile of a galaxy in the determination of the galaxy s rotation velocity . in this",
    "routine , velocity measurements are made separately for each spatial row ; the velocity at each row is determined from the center of a gaussian fit to the galaxy s emission along the dispersion direction . for the most part , the relative amplitudes of the gaussian peaks in each spatial row do not affect the relative velocity measurements .",
    "due to seeing blurring and the small pixel scale of our data , emission seen in adjacent spatial rows is not entirely independent , though .",
    "a galaxy s light profile could therefore have a small effect on the resulting velocity measurements .",
    "a second advantage of this routine is that it concatenates velocity measurements from a user - specified number of emission lines for a given object before determining @xmath46 .",
    "that is , the emission lines can be fit together or separately .",
    "a disadvantage of this method is that it assumes galaxy emission profiles are gaussian along the dispersion direction .",
    "this does not necessarily reflect the true emission distribution and may bias velocity measurements , as they are derived from the gaussian - fit centers of the emission .",
    "furthermore , this routine simply does not take full advantage of the two dimensions of information available from a spectrum .",
    "gelfit2d is a much simpler fitting routine in that it directly compares data to emission line models , without any intermediate ( e.g. , gaussian fitting ) steps .",
    "gelfit2d fits a larger number of parameters than the gauss2d routine , providing additional measurements .",
    "these include the offset of a galaxy within a slit , the radius within which emission is truncated at the center of a galaxy , the emission line scale length , and the flux ratio of the [ ] doublet .",
    "furthermore , gelfit2d has a much more sophisticated method for parameter optimization than gauss2d . while gelfit2d only runs on one emission line at a time , a possible benefit is independent modeling of the position of the galaxy within the slit at red and blue wavelengths , indirectly allowing us to account for atmospheric dispersion ( factor 11 ) . it should be noted that gelfit2d also has disadvantages , the main one being the assumption of a symmetric exponential intensity profile .",
    "this assumption can strongly affect resulting velocity measurements , particularly for galaxies with asymmetries , spiral arms , and/or star - forming hot spots .",
    "both routines take on average 15 - 20 minutes to run per galaxy .",
    "gauss2d requires real - time user input of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ranges and increments to be tested .",
    "gelfit2d is completely automated , but optimizes eight parameters rather than two .",
    "because gelfit2d fits each emission line separately , this routine may take longer if a large number of lines are fit .",
    "run - times for both gauss2d and gelfit2d are also dependent upon the amount of subsampling desired : highly inclined galaxies will take the longest to run because the subsampling factor will be largest .",
    "for ease of comparison , in table 4 we again list the modeling factors described in  3.2 . we also describe how and whether we have taken them into account using gauss2d and gelfit2d . in table 5 , we list velocity measurements for our sample of 15 cl0024 members determined via both routines . in general , we find that the two methods yield gratifyingly similar results , as can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "we note that in all cases , emission was measured out to radii beyond 2.2@xmath48 , the radius at which local galaxy studies often determine rotation velocities ( e.g. , courteau 1997 ) . objects with truncated emission were not eliminated directly because of the small extent of their emission , but because the turnovers in their velocity distributions were not strong enough for us to measure @xmath46 .",
    "of course , the latter criterion does bias our sample toward galaxies with large emission line extents ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "however , we note that some galaxies with relatively large emission line extents did not make it into our final tully fisher sample because the signal - to - noise in the outskirts of their emission was too low for us to reliably measure @xmath46 .",
    "four of the objects in our sample yielded particularly odd emission distributions and/or poor kinematic fits ( see the appendix for more notes on individual objects ) .",
    "one object ( tfr 01 ) exhibits high - ionization emission lines characteristic of an agn ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath65 ) and has a measured [ ] flux ratio i(@xmath66)/i(@xmath67 ) = 0.4 , indicating electron densities over 1000 @xmath68 .",
    "this emission is particularly concentrated toward the center of the galaxy : we measure a disk scale length of 1.1@xmath34 and an emission scale length of only @xmath69 .",
    "we caution that the derived rotation velocity may represent motion of gas in the galaxy core only .",
    "the other three objects are butcher - oemler  blue \" galaxies whose morphologies were examined by lavery , pierce , & mcclure ( 1992 ; hereafter lpm92 ) and linewidths were measured by koo et al .",
    "these are the only three objects in our sample that overlap with the lpm92 and koo et al .  studies",
    ". one of these objects ( tfr 10 ) appears to contain a large , knotty ring of emission .",
    "lpm92 describe this galaxy as having a  disturbed \" morphology .",
    "this is the largest and most rapidly rotating galaxy in our sample , and its velocity curve appears to turn over at large radii . the morphological and kinematic distortion in this galaxy indicate that it may have undergone a recent interaction .",
    "koo et al .",
    "report a linewidth @xmath70 km s@xmath28 for this object , where here @xmath71 refers to the standard deviation measured by fitting a gaussian to the spatially collapsed ( one - dimensional ) emission .",
    "we measure a gaussian @xmath72 km s@xmath28 for tfr 10 but find @xmath73 km s@xmath28 .",
    "we discuss possible sources for the differences between these measurements below .",
    "the remaining two  unusual \" objects ( tfr 04 and tfr 08 ) have odd morphologies poorly fit with our gim2d bulge + disk modeling .",
    "both objects have such steeply rising rotation curves at their cores that a pure step function ( @xmath74 ) velocity distribution convolved with realistic seeing could not reproduce the observed velocity curve .",
    "therefore , our velocity measurements appear to be overestimated .",
    "this is most clearly apparent in output from gauss2d ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "since the gelfit2d velocity measurements closely match those from gauss2d , we assume they are overestimated as well . as in the case of tfr 10 , linewidths measured by koo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are significantly smaller ( 40 and 50 km s@xmath28 for tfr 04 and tfr 08 , respectively ) than our @xmath46 measurements ( 120 and 135 km s@xmath28 ) .",
    "however , we measure similar gaussian linewidths of 75 and 40 km s@xmath28 for the two objects , generally in agreement with koo et al . both of these objects were flagged as probable mergers / interacting galaxies by lpm92 ; we consider them tidally distorted .    in the three cases where our samples overlap ( tfr 04 , tfr 08 , and tfr 10 ) , our @xmath46 measurements are much larger than the velocity widths measured by koo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from spatially collapsed emission .",
    "this is due in part to inherent differences between the measurement techniques .",
    "emission toward the outer regions of a galaxy ( where velocities are often highest ) is given more weight in rotation curve analysis than in linewidth analysis , where the emission signature is collapsed into one dimension .",
    "furthermore , koo et al .",
    "fit the linewidths of the three galaxies in question with gaussians despite the fact that the velocity profiles of these galaxies are complex , exhibiting 2 - 3 local peaks .",

    "it is not surprising that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our cl0024 tully - fisher sample ( @xmath76 ) exhibit unusual kinematics . nor",
    "is it surprising that these galaxies were relatively poorly fit by our rotation curve analysis routines .",

    "furthermore , we have redetermined radio - equivalent velocity widths based on the @xmath133 measurements , replacing step 2 of table 6 with a similar calibration derived from the min - max velocities , arctangent velocities , and turnover radii presented in courteau ( 1997 ) , and the disk scale lengths given in courteau ( 1996 ) .",
    "we find that using @xmath133 does reduce the total scatter in the cl0024 tfr , measured as a simple offset from the kff02 relation , to 0.42 mag ; this is comparable to our measurement errors alone .",

    "therefore , we continue with our tf residual analysis based on @xmath46 measurements .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , verheijen 2001 ) have searched for a  third parameter \" to the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies , analogous to the dependence of velocity dispersion and surface brightness on galaxy size for early - types ( known as the fundamental plane , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) . until recently",
    ", no strong evidence has been given for a relationship between tully - fisher residuals ( @xmath107tf ) and other galaxy properties .",

    "this finding is supported by a similar trend found in the nearby ursa major cluster by verheijen ( 2001 ) .",
    "although the number of galaxies in our sample is relatively small , we attempt here to look for correlations between tully - fisher residuals and other fundamental galaxy properties in cl0024 , in the hopes that they may provide clues about evolutionary processes in the cluster .    in the following analysis , we define @xmath107tf as the difference between a galaxy s observed luminosity and its predicted luminosity , derived from a comparison of its rotation velocity to the cl0024 tfr ( characterized by a simple 0.50 mag offset from the kff02 relation ) : @xmath134 + 0.50\\}\\ ] ]    we have determined errors on these tf residuals by adding our photometry errors ( 0.15 mag ) in quadrature with our velocity measurement errors , converted to magnitudes .",

    "a better treatment of the data will be to discuss _ velocity _ residuals from the tully - fisher relation for distant galaxies .",

    "we also round the velocity residuals to the nearest 5 km s@xmath28 to reflect the precision of our data .      in figure 6 ( top panels ) , we compare tf residuals ( @xmath107tf ) to the fundamental parameters of the tfr itself : luminosity ( @xmath104 ) and velocity ( log @xmath95 ) . as can be seen in figure 6(a ) , there is no dependence of @xmath107tf on luminosity : using the spearman rank test on the `` normal '' sample , we find a 77% probability that the correlation between @xmath107tf and @xmath104 occurred by chance . a formal line fit to this sample yields a slope of @xmath136 , indicating that the data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis ( zero slope , or no correlation ) at only the 1.6@xmath71 level .",
    "we shade the left side of figure 6(a ) to indicate our selection bias against galaxies with @xmath137 .",
    "only one galaxy fainter than this limit ( tfr 08 ) has made it into our sample due to its very strong emission .",
    "on the other hand , in figure 6(b ) , tf residuals for our sample appear to be correlated with rotation velocity ( the chance probability of the correlation is six in 10,000 ) , such that the most slowly rotating systems are most overluminous .",
    "furthermore , our formal fit to the `` normal '' sample is inconsistent with the null hypothesis at the 9@xmath71 level .",
    "this may indicate slope evolution of the tfr and be evidence for mass - segregated luminosity evolution , a possible outcome of harassment ( e.g. , gnedin 2003 ) .",
    "indeed , if we do not assume a local tully - fisher slope in cl0024 , we find that an inverse fit to the `` normal '' sample shown in figure 5(d ) yields a tully - fisher slope of @xmath138 as opposed to the kff02 slope of @xmath139 .",
    "evidence for a slope change in the same direction has also been observed in the field ( simard & pritchet 1998 , mallen - ornelas et al .  1999 ,",
    "ziegler et al .",

    "1997 ) , these effects are significant yet relatively unexplored in distant tully - fisher studies .",
    "we have shaded figure 6(b ) to demonstrate how luminosity incompleteness at @xmath137 affects the distribution of data points in this diagram .",
    "it is possible that the correlation between velocity and @xmath107tf we find may be artificially tight because we can not observe galaxies to the lower left in this plot .",
    "we investigate this further in figure 7 , where we demonstrate how magnitude selection affects tully - fisher measurements of three randomly generated galaxy populations : a low - dispersion sample ( black points ) , a medium - dispersion sample ( dark grey points ) , and a high - dispersion sample ( light grey points ) .",
    "we have perturbed the velocities and luminosities of the galaxies in each of these samples around the @xmath97-band tfr measured in kff02 , increasing the perturbations as the galaxies luminosities and velocities decrease to reflect the fact that we typically incur larger measurement errors at the low - luminosity end of the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the numbers of galaxies we have generated in each luminosity bin follow the shape of the @xmath140-band luminosity function given in blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with 0.45 subtracted from the @xmath140-band magnitude , as this is the typical @xmath140-@xmath97 color of an sab galaxy ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in figure 7(a ) , we show the tully - fisher relation for the three samples we have generated .",
    "this panel is shaded to demonstrate a selection bias against galaxies with @xmath137 , as seen in the cl0024 sample . for a given low velocity",
    ", one can see that only the highest - luminosity data points make it into the unshaded region of the diagram . in figure 7(b ) , we present the corresponding log(velocity)-@xmath107tf relation , also shaded to reflect our magnitude selection bias .",
    "the low - velocity , high - luminosity galaxies show up as a tail toward the upper left of the unshaded region of the diagram .",
    "this tail is particularly prominent for the high - dispersion sample , and could lead one to measure tully - fisher slope evolution despite the fact that no slope change was input into the sample .",
    "this is clear in table 10 , where we list the the input tully - fisher and log(velocity)-@xmath107tf relations , as well as the measured tully - fisher and log(velocity)-@xmath107tf relations for the galaxies with @xmath141 in each of the three generated samples .    the magnitude selection bias results in increasingly `` shallower '' measured tully - fisher slopes with increasing dispersion .",
    "( we note that `` shallower '' tully - fisher slopes actually appear steeper in our diagrams , as we have plotted the inverse tully - fisher relation in figures 5 and 7 . )",
    "this slope change is in the same direction as that indicated by our own data and measured in other distant tully - fisher studies ( e.g. , ziegler et al .",
    "2002 , bhm et al .  2004 ) .",
    "an apparent slope change in this direction due to magnitude incompleteness has also been found in the local studies of willick ( 1994 ) and giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in our case , the selection bias results in an increasingly prominent and steep correlation between velocity and @xmath107tf with increasing dispersion . from figure 7 and table 10",
    ", we see that any tully - fisher slope evolution inferred particularly from our low - luminosity cl0024 data points is strongly affected by magnitude incompleteness in combination with measurement errors and the intrinsic dispersion of the galaxies properties .",
    "however , if there were no slope evolution , we would expect to see a turn - off to @xmath107tf = 0 at the high - velocity end in the log(velocity)-@xmath107tf diagram ( see figure 7b ) .",
    "we do not see this in the cl0024 sample ( figure 6b ) .",
    "it is possible that an incorrect measurement of the slope of the tully - fisher relation would cause us not to see a turn - off to @xmath107tf = 0 at the high - velocity end of the figure 6(b )",
    ". this would be the case particularly if we measured a `` steeper '' , or more strongly negative , slope than that which characterized the true distribution of our sample .",
    "however , as explained above , it is much more likely that we would measure an overly `` shallow '' slope , given our magnitude incompleteness . in the bottom panels of figure 7 ,",
    "we demonstrate the effect of a `` shallow '' slope measurement on the log(velocity)-@xmath107tf relation . in figure 7(c ) , we plot the log(velocity)-@xmath107tf relation for the high - dispersion sample of generated data , as this is the sample for which it is most difficult to measure a tully - fisher slope . here , as in figure 7(b ) , we have derived @xmath107tf by comparing the generated galaxy magnitudes to their expected magnitudes , given their velocities and the _ known input _ tully - fisher relation . in figure 7(d ) , we again plot log(velocity ) versus @xmath107tf , but this time we have calculated @xmath107tf by comparing generated galaxy magnitudes to those expected from the _ measured _ tully - fisher relation ( see table 10 ) , assuming the input relation was unknown .",
    "as can be seen in this diagram , an underestimated ( or less strongly negative ) tully - fisher slope still results in a turn - off , or here a turn - up , at the high - velocity end of the log(velocity)-@xmath107tf relation .",
    "again , we do not see this in the cl0024 sample ( see figure 6b ) , and we therefore conclude that the tully - fisher slope evolution we see in the cluster may be real .",
    "we would need a larger galaxy sample to discern more conclusively whether or not the slope of the tully - fisher relation is evolving . furthermore , quantifying the effect of magnitude selection on our measurement of tully - fisher slope evolution requires monte - carlo simulations with knowledge of galaxy number counts built in . that work is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we caution here that the apparent slope evolution found by other authors ( e.g. , bhm et al .",
    "2004 ) may also be affected by magnitude incompleteness .",
    "it is also possible that their results are driven by low - luminosity galaxies with truncated rotation curves or other kinematic anomalies that have resulted in underestimated rotation velocities ( kannappan & barton 2004 ) .",
    "this does not appear to be the case for our sample ( see  5.1.6 ) , as cl0024 members with the smallest emission line extents are generally the most underluminous .",
    "again , this points toward the fact that the tully - fisher slope evolution we see in cl0024 may be real . future studies with larger sample sizes will clarify this result .      in figure 6(c ) , we probe the correlation between cl0024 @xmath107tf and galaxy colors .",
    "we find a marginally significant correlation , with a chance probability of 5% .",
    "the formal line fit to the `` normal '' sample is inconsistent with the null hypothesis at the 5@xmath71 level .",
    "as previously mentioned , a relationship between tf residuals and color has recently been found in the nearby field ( using @xmath96 colors ) by kff02 and in the ursa major cluster ( using @xmath142 colors ) by verheijen ( 2001 ) . however ,",
    "kannappan & barton ( 2004 ) stress that local galaxies with kinematic anomalies tend to be outliers from the color-@xmath107tf relation .",
    "indeed , we find a much less significant correlation ( chance probability of 19% ) if we fit the color-@xmath107tf relation for our total cl0024 sample , including four `` anomalous '' galaxies , rather than the `` normal '' sample .",
    "kff02 infer that the color-@xmath107tf relationship reflects the galaxies star formation histories , as predicted by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) . for comparison",
    ", we plot the kff02 relation , converted to our restframe passbands ( s.  j.  kannappan , private communication ) , in figure 6(c ) and find that it lies very close to our data points .",
    "we also stress here that @xmath98 , @xmath95 , and @xmath143 are all inter - related .",
    "it is well - known at lower redshifts that galaxy velocities and colors are correlated such that less massive galaxies have bluer colors . in the top panel of figure 8 , we show that the same is true in cl0024 .",
    "if we follow the example of rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we can fit @xmath98 , log @xmath95 , and @xmath143 simultaneously according to the following equation : @xmath144    the fit to our total sample yields @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "this is in good agreement ( though we have much larger errors ) with the simultanous fit of rix et al . , who found @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 for @xmath6 field galaxies .",
    "note that rix et al .",
    "used @xmath151 colors in their fit rather than @xmath143 ; @xmath151 roughly corresponds to @xmath143 at @xmath0 , neglecting @xmath152-corrections .    in the bottom panel of figure 8",
    ", we further address the relationship between @xmath98 , @xmath95 , and @xmath143 . here , we have re - plotted the color-@xmath107tf relation for cl0024 , where the solid line in this panel represents a fit to the `` normal '' data points .",
    "if we compare the color - velocity relation for cl0024 members ( top panel of figure 8) to the velocity-@xmath107tf relation ( see figure 6 ) , we can re - determine the color-@xmath107tf relation in cl0024 .",
    "the dotted line in the lower panel of figure 8 shows the color-@xmath107tf relation derived in this way .",
    "clearly , the latter relation fits the data points well , suggesting that in the case of cl0024 , the color-@xmath107tf relation may not be fundamental , but instead a natural outcome of the color - velocity and velocity-@xmath107tf relations .      closely tied to",
    "the color-@xmath107tf relation is the correlation between @xmath107tf and global h@xmath2 equivalent width ( ew ) found by kff02 .",
    "while @xmath143 colors trace the ratio between young and somewhat older stellar populations in galaxies , ew(h@xmath2 ) traces very recent star formation , on timescales of myr . in figure 6(d ) , we explore the relationship between global ew(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath107tf . here , we have measured global ew(h@xmath2 ) from integrated one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra using splot in iraf . for each galaxy ,",
    "the integrated 1d spectrum was extracted by summing the two - dimensional spectrum along the full spatial extent of the galaxy s emission .",
    "this is the same procedure that was used to extract integrated 1d spectra and determine the global ew(h@xmath2 ) of the galaxies presented in kff02 ( see jansen et al .",
    "because the line strengths measured for both the local and distant samples have been made across each entire galaxy , we do not expect aperture effects to affect our results .",
    "we again point out that are able to detect emission to a radius beyond two scale lengths for each of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "furthermore , we do not expect surface brightness dimming to play a role , as this would affect our ability to detect a galaxy s emission and the continuum used to normalize our equivalent width measurements in the same way .",
    "we find a relatively strong ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath107tf correlation in cl0024 ( chance probability of 4% for the `` normal '' sample ) .",
    "this is driven , however , by the strongest emission line object in our sample . excluding this object from our analysis",
    ", we find that the correlation essentially goes away : we find a chance probability of 14% and a slope consistent with the null hypothesis . as in the case of the color-@xmath107tf relation ,",
    "it is possible that the lack of a strong ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath107tf relation in cl0024 indicates that there are galaxies with anomalous kinematic signatures within our sample .",
    "we also include figure 6(d ) in our analysis to address the concern ( e.g. , in kannappan et al .",
    "2003 ) that distant tully - fisher studies are based on galaxy samples with very strong emission lines as compared to local samples .",
    "this may affect our interpretation of tully - fisher evolution , as we would expect galaxies with large negative ews to be somewhat overluminous according to the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath107tf correlation found by kff02 and seen in figure 6 .",
    "as noted earlier , kannappan et al .",

    "while cluster galaxies generally do not have strong emission lines as compared to galaxies in the field , our sample does have somewhat stronger lines than the kff02 sample : the majority of the galaxies in our sample have @xmath153 ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath154 , whereas the majority of the kff02 sample lies in the range @xmath155 ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath156 .",
    "this offset can be seen in figure 6(d ) , where we compare a line fit to our `` normal '' sample ( solid line ) to the relationship between ew(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath107tf found by kff02 ( see also kannappan 2001 where the calibration is given in the @xmath97 band ) . due to their strong emission",
    ", we would expect the galaxies in our sample to be overluminous , given their rotation velocities , as compared to the kff02 sample . the fact that we instead find slight evidence for an underluminosity is therefore all the more striking .",
    "courteau & rix ( 1999 ) postulate that a correlation between @xmath107tf and galaxy sizes may reflect the relative contributions of stellar disks and dark matter halos to total galaxy masses .",
    "however , these authors find little evidence for such a correlation .",
    "we find essentially no evidence for a relationship between the two parameters ( 42% chance probability for the `` normal '' sample , inconsistent with null hypothesis at only the 3@xmath71 level ) , as can be seen in figure 6(e ) . in similar investigations ,",
    "only marginal correlations between @xmath107tf and galaxy surface brightnesses have been found by kff02 and verheijen ( 2001 ) .",
    "the lack of a strong correlation found between @xmath107tf and disk sizes could be influenced by the fact that it is difficult to measure rotation curves for small disk systems .",

    "this may particularly affect distant , low - luminosity galaxies , for which the outer regions of optical emission lines , where velocities are highest , are very faint .",
    "kannappan & barton suggest that distant tfr studies ( e.g. , ziegler et al .  2002 , bhm et al .  2004 ) which report a tully - fisher slope change may be affected by this problem .    in figure 6(f ) , we test whether truncated rotation curves may be affecting our results . there",
    "we plot cl0024 member emission line extents against their tully - fisher residuals .",
    "we find a marginally significant correlation ( chance probability of 5% , but the `` normal '' sample is inconsistent with the null hypothesis at only the 2.6@xmath71 level ) such that galaxies with low emission line extents are most underluminous .",
    "this is the opposite of what we would expect to find if emission line truncation was affecting our tully - fisher analysis .",
    "however , we note that our sample does not span a wide range of emission line extents . furthermore , our sample is not complete at low luminosities , and therefore we do not place great significance on our finding of a tully - fisher slope change ( see  5.1.2 ) .       the strongest relationship shown in figure 6",
    "is the dependence of @xmath107tf on log(@xmath95 ) in cl0024 , which may be affected by magnitude incompleteness .",
    "while we do not make strong evolutionary claims based on this finding , we still address a concern expressed by barton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that a poor determination of the tfr slope and/or sample selection effects can result in false correlations of galaxy characteristics with tf residuals .",
    "based on this reasoning , barton et al .  essentially negate a relationship between galaxy asymmetries and @xmath107tf claimed by zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) . in ",
    "5.1.2 , we explored the effects of magnitude selection on the relationship between velocity and @xmath107tf , and we presented evidence that our data suggest a real change in tully - fisher slope .    to further test the strength of the correlation we have measured , we have re - analyzed the dependence of @xmath107tf on log(@xmath95 ) for the `` normal '' cl0024 sample , varying the slope of the tfr significantly .",
    "we find that the chance probability of the velocity-@xmath107tf correlation consistently remains below a few percent for a wide range of tully - fisher slopes , from @xmath157 to @xmath158 .",

    "still , we caution that the strength of the velocity-@xmath107tf correlation we find in cl0024 may be affected by the tully - fisher slope we have chosen for the analysis .",
    "earlier in  5 , we reported evidence for an increase in scatter in the cl0024 tfr as compared to local field samples that have been `` pruned '' to include only morphologically normal spirals .",
    "it is possible that an increase in scatter could be due to a high incidence of interactions within the cluster . supporting evidence comes from barton et al .",

    "cl0024 is known to contain merger candidates ( lavery , pierce & mcclure 1992 ) , and in  3.2.4 we have detailed four cluster members in our sample of 15 which have unusual kinematic distributions .",

    "kannappan & barton ( 2004 ) find that interacting and kinematically anomalous galaxies tend to be outliers on this relation , and therefore our result may indicate a higher fraction of anomalous galaxies in our sample than is apparent upon inspection of our ( relatively low - resolution ) data .",
    "likely signatures of recent mergers and tidal interactions include structural anomalies .",
    "we therefore examine cl0024 tf residuals versus photometric residual and asymmetry measurements from gim2d modeling ( figure 9 , top panels ) .",

    "therefore , it is not clear that our gelfit2d residual and asymmetry measurements are very sensitive to intrinsic kinematic distortions in cl0024 members .    as a last probe of interactions in cl0024",
    ", we note that counter - rotating galaxies have been found in nearby field samples ( e.g. , by kff02 ) and are a predicted outcome of galaxy mergers ( rubin 1994 ) . in figure 10",
    ", we check for counter - rotation of gas and stars in two members of our cl0024 tully - fisher sample for which we have high enough s / n continuum data to make stellar velocity measurements .",
    "we believe that this is the first direct comparison of stellar and gas rotation for such distant galaxies .",
    "one of the galaxies highlighted in figure 10 ( tfr 01 ) is a likely agn ; the other ( tfr 04 ) appears to be tidally distorted ( see discussion in  3.2.4 ) .",
    "we find no evidence for counter - rotation in these galaxies .",
    "however , we note that the majority of nearby counter - rotators are early - type galaxies ( e.g. , kuijken , fisher , & merrifield 1996 ; morse et al .",
    "these early - types may represent merger remnants , whereas at least a subsample of cl0024 emitters may be in the beginning stages of interactions or undergoing a different class of interactions , such as harassment .",
    "in this paper , we have measured the rotation velocities of 15 members of galaxy cluster cl0024 at @xmath0 , and we have presented one of the first tully - fisher analyses for a distant cluster .",
    "our key points are the following :    1 .",
    "we have measured cl0024 member velocities via two different rotation curve analysis methods : gauss2d , which closely resembles the method used by vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) , and gelfit2d , which is similar to the method used by simard & pritchet ( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "both methods yield similar rotation velocity measurements , within the errors",
    "we find that four of the galaxies in our sample have unusual kinematic properties or emission distributions .",
    "one of these galaxies is a likely agn , another has a knotty ring of star formation .",
    "the remaining two have odd morphologies and are poorly fit by our velocity models , implying possible non - circular motions and/or recent interactions .",
    "similar fractions ( @xmath172 ) of kinematically  anomalous \" galaxies have been found in the distant field studies of rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and simard & pritchet ( 1998 ) . in the local virgo cluster ,",
    "rubin , waterman , & kenney ( 1999 ) find that as many as 50% of spirals exhibit unual kinematic distributions .",
    "the cl0024 tully - fisher relation is consistent with no luminosity evolution , or perhaps a marginal _ underluminosity _ , as compared to the local sample of kannappan , fabricant , & franx ( 2002 ) . in our analysis of the cl0024 tfr",
    ", we have demonstrated the importance of accounting for differences between distant and local galaxy velocity and luminosity measurement techniques .",
    "furthermore , the choice of local comparison sample influences the interpretation of tully - fisher evolution .",
    "combined , these two effects change our cl0024 tfr results by @xmath191 mag .",
    "we have probed the dependence of cl0024 members tully - fisher residuals upon other galaxy properties , in the hopes of uncovering evidence of the evolutionary processes that may be affecting the galaxies .",
    "the strongest relationship we find is between tf residuals and rotation velocities in the cluster , suggesting tully - fisher slope evolution .",
    "we caution that magnitude selection and the choice of tully - fisher slope used in the residual analysis may strongly affect this result , however .",
    "evidence for galaxy interactions as an evolutionary driver in cl0024 is unclear from the weak correlations we find between tf residuals and photometric residuals and asymmetries .",
    "no apparent relationship exists between tf residuals and emission line residuals and asymmetries , but this may be due to the relatively low resolution of our kinematic data . furthermore , this result may be affected by small number statistics . 6 .",
    "we find no evidence for counter - rotation between stars ( as measured from absorption ) and gas ( as measured from emission ) in two cl0024 members for which we have high enough s / n data to make such measurements .",
    "one of these galaxies exhibits characteristics of an agn ; the other appears to be morphologically disturbed .",
    "this study is intended as a pilot investigation of the tully - fisher relation in distant clusters . with our small sample size and",
    "focus on a single cluster , we can not make sweeping statements about the tfr and tf residuals as indicators of evolutionary processes in clusters . however , our results are intended as a baseline for comparison to future studies made with larger samples of distant cluster galaxies .    in the future ,",
    "observations with integral field units ( e.g. , pracy et al .  2005 ) will likely be essential to understanding the interplay between galaxy internal kinematics and evolutionary drivers in both the cluster and field environments .",
    "such observations will provide two - dimensional measurements linking star formation rates , metallicities , shock diagnostics , and kinematics , allowing observers to determine direct links between these diagnostics and evolutionary predictions .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for insightful comments which have greatly improved our analysis .",
    "we are grateful to sheila kannappan , with whom we discussed the galaxy velocity measurement techniques that are used in local tully - fisher studies .",
    "stphane courteau kindly provided us with local galaxy velocity measurements .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank greg wirth for help with the cl0024 spectra , and dan kelson for distributing his python spectral reduction modules and training us to use them .",
