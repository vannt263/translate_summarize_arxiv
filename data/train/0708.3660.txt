    "the pipe nebula , at a distance of 130 pc , is one of the closest molecular cloud complexes in the galaxy . with a mass of 10@xmath6@xmath0",
    ", it spans @xmath5 48 degs@xmath10 on the sky but contains little evidence for active star formation .",
    "in addition to tracing the larger - scale molecular gas associated with the pipe nebula , a , , and ( 10 ) ( highly undersampled ) survey of the region @xcite detected a small number of dense cores .",
    "the densest of these , associated with the dark cloud b59 , appears to be the only site within the pipe nebula where active star formation is occurring .",
    "indeed , recent _ spitzer _ observations reveal an embedded cluster of young stellar objects within b59 @xcite .",
    "recent extinction studies of the pipe nebula ( @xcite ; alves , lombardi , & lada 2007 ) reveal many compact dust cores that likely represent incipient sites of star formation .",
    "these cores were identified using 2mass extinction maps derived from the jhk photometry of over 4.5 million stars ( fig .",
    "[ pipe ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the individual compact cores were extracted from the larger - scale , more diffuse lower - column density material associated with the molecular cloud via a wavelet transform technique ( see @xcite ) . in total ,",
    "159 cores were identified and span a range in peak a@xmath11 and core mass and are distributed throughout the pipe nebula @xcite .",
    "this large sample represents a critical data base for measuring the initial conditions for star formation and testing theories of core formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , the dense core mass function ( cmf ) generated from these cores reveals a similarity to the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. @xcite ) with the profound implication that the stellar imf is in fact predetermined by the form of the cmf .",
    "the origin of the stellar imf may be , therefore , directly linked to the origin of dense cores .",
    "while the pipe nebula represents an excellent example of a molecular cloud in a very early stage of star formation , little work has been done to ascertain the dynamical and evolutionary status of its cores .",
    "our aim is to study these cores in detail via the combination of their extinction and molecular line properties ; the extinction map reveals measurements of the core masses and sizes while the molecular line observations reveal the kinematics and gas temperatures within the cores . to this end",
    ", we are conducting extensive ground- and space - based surveys of the cores located within the pipe nebula .",
    "the pipe cores are well suited for studies of core formation and evolution because they are distributed over a large area , are well separated and well defined , and represent a complete sample of dense cores within a single cloud with accurate masses in the mass range of @xmath5 0.2 to 20.4@xmath0 .    to begin , we have obtained ( 10 ) observations toward a sample of 94 cores distributed throughout the nebula .",
    "the details of these observations and results are presented in @xcite . in brief summary ,",
    "all cores show strong emission , have measured linewidths , @xmath12v , of @xmath5  0.14  0.61 , and show no size - linewidth correlation .",
    "because ( 10 ) emission traces all molecular gas along the line of sight , the measured linewidths will trace both the lower density intercore material in addition to the dense gas associated with the core . to isolate the emission from the dense core",
    ", we have also obtained nh@xmath1 observations toward a sample of the pipe cores and report the results of these observations here . because nh@xmath1 requires such high densities to be excited ( @xmath13 10@xmath6@xmath7 ) , only the densest gas will exhibit significant nh@xmath1 emission .",
    "thus , nh@xmath1 observations will reveal the fraction of cores in the pipe nebula that contain dense gas .",
    "determination of the dense core fraction and how it varies across the core mass function and with kinematical state will provide crucial data for understanding the evolutionary status of these objects .",
    "the combination of the extinction and molecular line studies ( and nh@xmath1 ) , and the implications for core formation and evolution , is discussed in @xcite , the third paper in this series on the pipe nebula . by accurately measuring the linewidths from the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission in each core , and by combining this with measurements of the core masses",
    ", one can determine the fraction of cores that are unbound and the core stabilty , which can provide important clues to their formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that the majority of pipe cores are pressure confined , gravitationally unbound objects whose properties are dominated by thermal processes in a pressurized medium .",
    "ammonia has been used extensively to study both high- and low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g.@xcite ) . because it is the least depleted species in , and , thus , the most reliable tracer of , cold dense gas within starless cores , we use nh@xmath1 to trace the densest gas in the pipe nebula .",
    "the 18 individual hyperfine components of the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) transitions can be used to measure the intrinsic one dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath14 ) , optical depth ( @xmath15 ) , and excitation temperature ( t@xmath16 ) .",
    "observations of the nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) transition were also obtained in order to directly measure the gas temperatures of the brightest cores in the sample .",
    "ratios of the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines reveal the kinetic temperature ( t@xmath9 ) and , therefore , density of the cores .    to probe the very densest gas and to determine the chemical evolution of the cores , we also obtained ccs ( 2@xmath21@xmath3 ) and hc@xmath4n ( 9,8 ) observations .",
    "these molecules are found in very dense starless cores ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance of carbon - chain molecules ( e.g. ccs and hc@xmath4n ) compared to nh@xmath1 is thought to trace the chemical evolution of cores ; carbon - chain molecules being more abundant in the very earliest stages in core evolution , compared to nh@xmath1 which is more abundant in the later stages ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the combination of these data can reveal the youth and star - forming potential of the cores .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a survey for nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) , nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) , ccs ( 2@xmath21@xmath3 ) , and hc@xmath4n ( 9,8 ) emission toward a sample of 46 of the extinction cores identified in the pipe nebula .",
    "all but one of these cores has been observed as part of the survey @xcite .",
    "we find that most cores are indeed associated with dense gas .",
    "their measured linewidths are narrow , with several cores having linewidths comparable to their thermal linewidths . the derived properties ( t@xmath9 , intrinsic @xmath12v , non - thermal @xmath12v , radius ) of the cores within the pipe nebula are similar to cores within other low - mass star - forming regions : the only difference is that the pipe cores typically have weaker nh@xmath1 emission and most show no current star formation .",
    "the observations were obtained using the 100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) from 2006 october to 2007 february . the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) ccs ( 2@xmath21@xmath3 ) , and hc@xmath4n ( 9,8 ) transitions were observed simultaneously using the k - band ( upper ) receiver .",
    "table  [ line - info ] lists the frequencies for each of these transitions .",
    "all spectra were obtained in the frequency switched mode ( @xmath17 = 4 mhz ) .",
    "the spectrometer was set up with a bandwidth of 12.5  mhz , which produced a frequency resolution of 1.846  khz ( velocity resolution of 0.023  ) .",
    "the gbt beam width at these frequencies is @xmath5 30 .    due to time constraints ,",
    "a sub - sample of the complete list of cores identified by @xcite were observed . in total , 46 of the 159 cores",
    "were observed and were selected to span a range in peak a@xmath11 , core mass , and location within the pipe nebula .",
    "the completeness of our sample based on the original catalog of @xcite is shown in figure  [ completeness ] as a function of both peak a@xmath11 and core mass .",
    "the peak a@xmath11 for the selected cores ranged from 5.3 to 23.7 magnitudes , while their masses range from 0.4 to 20.4@xmath0 ; all cores in the original sample with peak a@xmath11 @xmath13 14 magnitudes and with masses @xmath13 4@xmath0 were observed .",
    "spectra were obtained toward the position of peak extinction for each core ( these positions are listed in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the cores were originally identified from 2mass extinction maps ( @xmath18 @xmath5 1 ; @xcite ) . because the coordinates listed in the catalog of @xcite refer to the centroid and not necessarily the position of peak extinction , the pointing centers for each core where selected by eye to correspond to the true extinction peak .",
    "thus , the coordinates listed here may differ slightly from the positions reported in the catalog of @xcite .    toward some of these cores",
    "we have also obtained higher - angular resolution extinction maps using the 3.5 m eso new technology telescope ( ntt ; @xmath18 @xmath5  15 ; @xcite ) . in many cases , we found sub - structure at higher - angular resolution . where possible , therefore , we used the higher - angular resolution extinction maps to pinpoint the position of peak extinction .",
    "we found that the extinction peaks could differ by as much as @xmath5 1 from the quoted positions in the @xcite catalog .",
    "thus , for the cores in which we have obtained these higher - angular resolution extinction maps , we use the coordinates of the peak extinction derived from them .",
    "these cores are marked with an asterisk in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "for the majority of cores , four @xmath5 5 minute integrations were combined for a total of 18 minutes on source . toward the brightest 4 cores only a single 5 minute spectrum was obtained . for three cores showing very faint nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission , we combined additional data for an on source integration time of over 70 minutes .",
    "the integration times , system temperatures ( t@xmath19 ) , source elevation ( el ) , and 1 @xmath20 rms for the spectra are listed in table  [ table1 ] . because the system temperatures for the individual frequencies varied by @xmath21 5% , we quote a single system temperature and , hence , 1 @xmath20 rms for each core .",
    "the pointing and focus were checked at the beginning of each observing session using a nearby , bright pointing source .",
    "the pointing corrections were typically @xmath58 in azimuth and @xmath51 in elevation .",
    "the flux density scale was determined from observations of 3c286 ( known flux density of 2.38  jy was taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra were converted from the raw data format into fits files using the sdfits package .",
    "all subsequent data reduction and analysis was performed using the gbtidl package .",
    "the individual polarizations for each spectrum were combined and averaged before opacity and elevation corrections were applied .",
    "a first order baseline was removed from all spectra using user - defined baseline windows .",
    "all quoted temperatures are t@xmath22 ( k ) .",
    "the observations were taken at low elevations ( @xmath5  19@xmath23 ) where the pointing model of the gbt is less reliable . as a result",
    ", the temperatures of the observations may be in error , either due to unintended pointing offsets or pointing drifts during the integrations  . to quantify the repeatability of the observations",
    ", we obtained a spectrum toward the core fest 1 - 457 ( our core 109 ) during each observing session .",
    "these data show a variation in peak temperature ( t@xmath22 ) of @xmath5 10% , while the linewidths show a variation of @xmath5 3 % ( these values were estimated by fitting two gaussians to the blended central hyperfine components ) .",
    "thus , while the temperatures listed may be uncertain , the linewidths and derived parameters ( e.g. @xmath15 , t@xmath9 , t@xmath16 ) , which are derived from the line ratios and , hence , independent of the absolute scale , will be reliable .",
    "the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) , nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) , ccs ( 2@xmath21@xmath3 ) , and hc@xmath4n ( 9,8 ) spectra for each core observed in the pipe nebula are shown in the appendix , together with its 2mass extinction map .",
    "we find many cores show little or no detectable nh@xmath1 , ccs , nor hc@xmath4n emission ( e.g. fig .",
    "many of the remaining cores show only weak nh@xmath1 emission from the central blended hyperfine components ( e.g. fig .",
    "a number of cores show weak nh@xmath1 emission , but strong ccs emission ( e.g. fig .",
    "only a small fraction of the cores show strong nh@xmath1 emission . toward these cores ,",
    "we clearly see the satellite components in addition to the central blended hyperfine components ( e.g.  figs .  30 and 53 ) .",
    "we find 12 cores that show bright nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission from both the central and satellite hyperfine components .",
    "to determine their line parameters , we used a forward - fitting routine ( for a full description see @xcite ) .",
    "this forward - fitting routine models the spectrum given input physical properties and then optimizes these values via non - linear least squares minimization .",
    "this method is in contrast to the usual way of determinining physical properties directly from the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) to ( 2,2 ) line ratios .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the uncertainties for the physical parameters can be determined in addition to the covariance among the parameters .    in this model ,",
    "the gas is assumed to have a slab geometry with uniform properties and that the velocity dispersions and excitation temperatures of the transitions are the same , i.e. the gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) . assuming the beam filling factor is unity , the spectrum is entirely determined by five parameteres : t@xmath9 ,",
    "t@xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and v@xmath24 .",
    "because the exinction cores are always several times larger than the gbt beam , the assumption that the beam filling factor is unity is valid .",
    "the spectra are easily modelled using this approach when the opacity is high . in the case of low optical depth , however , the parameters t@xmath16 and @xmath15 become degenerate and it is not possible to solve for them independently . instead ,",
    "the fit is optimized for the free parameter and , thus , in this case , the spectrum is determined by four free parameters : t@xmath9 , @xmath25 , @xmath14 , and v@xmath24 .",
    "table  [ line - parameters-1 ] lists the measured t@xmath22 , v@xmath24 , @xmath14 , and integrated intensity for all cores showing nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission with detections @xmath13 3@xmath20 . for the 12 bright cores ,",
    "the v@xmath24 and @xmath14 were determined using the forward - fitting routine discussed above ( these cores are marked with an asterisk in table  [ line - parameters-1 ] ) .",
    "the quoted t@xmath22 in these cases were measured from a single gaussian fit to the central blended component .",
    "the integrated intensity was calculated by summing the emission across the spectrum ( from v=@xmath2623 to 30 ) .    toward the remaining 34 cores",
    "observed , we find 17 cores with weak nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) detections .",
    "because the emission is considerably weaker in these cases , only the central blended components were detected ( @xmath13 3@xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , to characterize this emission , we fit a single gaussian profile to the observed emission .",
    "the t@xmath22 , v@xmath24 , and integrated intensity measured from these fits are included within table  [ line - parameters-1 ] .    because the central component is a blend of 8 individual hyperfine components , the velocity dispersion determined from fitting a single gaussian profile to the emission",
    "will be overestimated . to constrain theories of core formation and evolution , we require accurate estimates of the core velocity dispersions .",
    "thus , it was necessary to determine the amount by which this measurement of the velocity dispersion was overestimated .    to derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion in the cases where we could not fit the spectra with all 18 hyperfine components , we used a conversion factor calculated from synthetic spectra .",
    "the synthetic spectra were generated to cover a range in @xmath14 , t@xmath16 , and @xmath15 .",
    "to each of these spectra , we fit a single gaussian profile to the central blended components and then compared the measured velocity dispersion to that which was used to generate the spectrum .    to determine the correction factor for all measured velocity dispersions we interpolated the relation to produce a curve converting the measured velocity dispersion to that of the intrinsic velocity dispersion ( our derived relation is similar to that modelled by @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the correction factor was determined using this method and then applied to each velocity dispersion measured from a single gaussian fit to the central blended hyperfine components ( 17 cores ) .",
    "these corrected velocity dispersions are quoted in table  [ line - parameters-1 ] .    in total , toward the 46 cores observed , nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission was detected ( @xmath13  3@xmath20 ) in 29 cases ( @xmath5  63% ) .",
    "nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission was detected toward cores spanning the full range of peak a@xmath11 and core mass within our sample .",
    "we find no clear correlation between the measured line parameters and either peak a@xmath11 or core mass .",
    "most ( @xmath5 86 % ) of the cores have t@xmath22  @xmath21  1  k. the v@xmath24 measured for the cores range from 3 to 6 consistent with the measured v@xmath24 of the molecular gas associated with pipe nebula ( as traced by ; @xcite ) .",
    "this confirms that these cores are indeed located within the large - scale molecular cloud associated with the pipe nebula and not either background or foreground objects .",
    "the measured velocity dispersions range from @xmath5 0.05 to 0.3 .      for the nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) ,",
    "ccs , and hc@xmath4n emission , we fit a single gaussian profile to all spectra with a @xmath13 3 @xmath20 detection .",
    "although the nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) emission comprise 21 individual hyperfine components , in all cases only the central 12 blended components were detected .",
    "tables  [ line - parameters-1 ] and [ line - parameters-2 ] list the peak t@xmath22 , v@xmath24 , @xmath14 , and integrated intensity obtained from these fits .    toward the 46 cores observed , nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) emission was detected in 10 cores ( @xmath5  22% ) , ccs emission in 13 cores ( @xmath5  28% ) , and hc@xmath4n emission in 4 cores ( @xmath5  9% ) .",
    "we find nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) detections toward cores spanning the range of peak a@xmath11 and core mass , with the most massive core showing the brightest nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) emission .",
    "in contrast , we only detect ccs emission for cores with peak a@xmath11 @xmath13 8 magnitudes and hc@xmath4n emission toward cores with peak a@xmath11 @xmath13 12 magnitudes .",
    "this is expected given that the critical densities of the ccs and hc@xmath4n transitions ( @xmath5 10@xmath27@xmath7 ) are higher than for nh@xmath1 ( @xmath5 10@xmath6@xmath7 ) and that there may be differences in their relative abundances due to evolutionary effects .",
    "the forward - fitting model that was used to derive the @xmath14 and v@xmath24 for the cores showing bright nh@xmath1 emission , also measures the physical properties of the gas .",

    "based on the critical density of nh@xmath1 ( n@xmath57 @xmath5 10@xmath6@xmath7 ) , we crudely estimate that the detection rate should be @xmath5 17% . because these volume densities were derived from the extinction maps , they correspond to the mean volume densities within the cores .",
    "the fact that we measure a higher detection rate from our observations ( @xmath5 63% ) is not surprising given that nh@xmath1 traces the densest inner parts of a compact core and that the cores most likely have inwardly increasing density gradients .    the detection rate for the nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) , ccs , and hc@xmath4n transitions are much lower compared to nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) likely due to the combination of the fact that higher densities are typically needed for their excitation and that differences in their chemical evolutionary stages will effect their relative abundances .",
    "in the case of ccs , its relative distribution to nh@xmath1 within the cores may differ significantly .",
    "in many dense , starless cores the distribution of nh@xmath1 and ccs emission is noticably different ; the nh@xmath1 emission is typically centrally concentrated , while the ccs emission arises from a ring - like structure around the nh@xmath1 core ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , morphological differences in the distributions of various depleted molecules , typically carbon bearing species , is clearly seen toward the b68 ( our core 101 ) and fest 1 - 457 ( our core 109 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the non - detection of nh@xmath1 emission toward many of the cores could arise because of the short integration time per position or because the spectra were not obtained toward the true density peak of the core . because we are primarily interested in the nh@xmath1 line ratios and velocity dispersions ,",
    "our results will not be significantly affected by the fact that we may not be pinpointing the peak of the nh@xmath1 emission .",
    "this will , however , effect the detection rate as we may be missing some emission that falls below our sensitivity limits given the short integration time per point .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ comparisons ] which compares an 18 minute integration to a 74 minute integration toward the same position in two cores ( cores 23 and 89 ) .",
    "the spectra obtained with the shorter integration time are noiser and , thus , the emission in these cases would not be considered a 3@xmath20 detection ( upper panels ) . the longer integrations ( lower panels )",
    "reveal that indeed nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission does arise from within these cores , albiet the emission is considerably weaker . given longer integration times per point",
    ", the detection rate for these cores would likely increase .    because only a single spectrum was obtained toward each core ,",
    "maps are necessary to determine if many of the non - detections may arise due to either inaccurate coordinates from the extinction maps or pointing errors due to the low observing elevations . for 36 of the cores , higher - angular resolution exinction maps , generated from ntt images ( 15 angular resolution ; @xcite ) , were used to locate the position of peak extinction . for the remaining 13 cores , we used the lower - angular resolution 2mass extinction maps ( 1 angular resolution ; @xcite ) .",
    "when comparing the positions of peak extinction between the two maps , we found that the position of peak extinction in the higher - angular resolution maps could differ from that obtained from the lower - angular resolution maps by @xmath5 1 ( @xmath5 2 gbt beams at these frequencies ) . in some cases ,",
    "the extinction cores identified from the 2mass maps actually consisted of several sub - structures in the higher - angular resolution maps .",
    "thus , the positions obtained for the 13 cores from the 2mass exinction map may not reflect the true position of peak extinction , or density , in the core at the angular scale of the gbt beam .",
    "however , because the cores are resolved in the 2mass extinction map ( typical sizes of 6 ) , and with respect to the gbt beam , the positions at which the spectra were obtained will still lie within each of the cores .",
    "they may not , therefore , necessarily correspond to the true peak of the extinction , density , nor the peak of the nh@xmath1 emission .",
    "this will be most obvious if the molecular line emission arises from a very compact , dense core .",
    "thus , the non detection in these cases may simply arise due to the fact that we were not pointing at the best position within the core and that the dense cores may be compact relative to the extinction cores . with only a single spectrum toward the cores it is difficult to rule out potential pointing offsets . obtaining nh@xmath1 and ccs maps toward each of the cores",
    "will reveal the true density peaks and their relative distributions with respect to the extinction .",
    "nevertheless , the majority of these cores appear to be bona fide dense cores .",
    "we find that the fraction of dense cores within the pipe nebula , as traced by nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission , is 100% for all cores with peak a@xmath11 @xmath13 15 magnitudes and mass @xmath13 6@xmath0 .",
    "this drops to @xmath5 60% for cores with masses @xmath21 6@xmath0 .",
    "deeper observations and mapping could likely raise the detection rate for nh@xmath1 toward these cores .",
    "figure  [ linewidths ] shows the measured one dimensional velocity dispersions for cores detected in nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) , ccs , hc@xmath4n , and as a function of the velocity dispersion measured from the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission ( the data are from @xcite ) . for gas with t@xmath9= 10  k the thermal velocity dispersions for these molecules",
    "are listed in table  [ line - info ] and are marked as dotted lines in figure  [ linewidths ] .",
    "these data reveal a strong correlation between the nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) , hc@xmath4n , , and nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) velocity dispersions . in the case of nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 )",
    ", the velocity dispersions are essentially identical to those measured from the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission . for the ccs to nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) comparison ,",
    "we see a larger range in the velocity dispersion .",
    "we find for hc@xmath4n the velocity dispersions are typically broader than those measured from the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission . because hc@xmath4n is heavier than the nh@xmath1 molecule ( and",
    "thus has a smaller thermal velocity dispersion ) the fact that the measured velocity dispersion from hc@xmath4n are typically broader than nh@xmath1 , may indicate that this emission is tracing a larger non - thermal component . with only four detections",
    "it is difficult to determine this with certainty .",
    "we find the velocity dispersions measured from the nh@xmath1 emission are typically narrower than those measured from the : the velocity dispersions are typically 1.4 times broader than nh@xmath1 .",
    "this is expected given the emission will trace all the gas along the line of sight , in contrast to nh@xmath1 , which traces only the gas associated with the dense compact core . as a result , the observations will over estimate the non - thermal component of the velocity dispersion .",
    "most cores have velocity dispersions which are about twice their thermal velocity dispersions ; the exception being those traced by hc@xmath4n and which show that @xmath14 is @xmath5 3 to 4 times broader than thermal .",
    "this suggests that the nh@xmath1 , ccs , hc@xmath4n , and emission is primarily tracing the non - thermal component of the gas .",
    "we find that the measured velocity dispersions from the and hc@xmath4n are the comparable for those cores where emission was detected in both transitions . because carbon species are more depleted in the densest inner core regions , it is likely that both these species arise in the outer most core edges .",
    "we find three cores that have velocity dispersions comparable to the thermal nh@xmath1 dispersion ( assuming gas at 10 k ) .",
    "although these cores have low signal to noise detections , it may be that they are purely dominated by thermal processes . using the unique measurement of t@xmath9 for each of the 12 cores where the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines were sufficiently strong that the spectra could be modelled ( the cores listed in table  [ fitspec ] )",
    ", we find that the majority of these cores have measured velocity dispersions @xmath5 1 to 2 times broader than thermal .    with this large sample of cores we can also investigate the size - linewidth relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the data presented here have the advantage of arising from cores within the same cloud which makes comparisons between these properties independent of distance effects .",
    "figure  [ size - linewidth ] shows the radius versus linewidth plot for cores detected in both and nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) .",
    "while we see the cores ( marked with open circles , from @xcite ) typically have broader linewidths compared to the nh@xmath1 cores ( marked as filled circles ) , the general trend between these two samples is similar : there appears to be no correlation between the core linewidth and size . as will be discussed in more detail in @xcite , the relatively flat distribution of the data within figure  [ size - linewidth ] suggests , therefore , that the cores are dominated by thermal rather than turbulent motions .",
    "this is also seen toward dense cores in other star forming regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .      past nh@xmath1 surveys of star forming regions such as taurus , ophiuchus , perseus , orion , and cepheus ,",
    "reveal that the measured properties within these regions showed general trends based on their star formation activity ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for instance , the regions dominated by dense young clusters ( e.g. orion and cepheus ) tend to have higher measured t@xmath9 , linewidths , and core masses . in contrast , taurus and ophiuchus have lower values for these properties , however , these cores tend to have higher column densities .",
    "perseus , being intermediate in its star - formation activity , also shows intermediate values for the derived nh@xmath1 properties ( see @xcite and referenecs therein ) .",
    "many of these studies find strong nh@xmath1 emission and a high detection rate toward the dense cores .",
    "however , many of the nh@xmath1 cores within these surveys are associated with _ iras _ sources ; in the case of orion , @xcite found _ iras _ sources coincident with 68% of the nh@xmath1 cores .",
    "such a high fraction of cores with obvious infrared emission suggests that star formation is already occurring within these cores .",
    "thus , the detection of strong nh@xmath1 emission in a starless core may imply that the star formation process is imminent .",
    "this is consistent with chemical evolutionary models that predict nh@xmath1 to be most abundant in the later evolutionary stages of core formation @xcite .",
    "our lower nh@xmath1 detection rate , compared to other nh@xmath1 surveys of star - forming regions , is consistent with the fact that the pipe cores have lower densities and most show little signs of active star formation .",
    "indeed , the core associated with b59 , the only site within the pipe nebula where current star formation is known to be occurring , is one of the few cores that shows very strong nh@xmath1 emission . although the detected nh@xmath1 emission was typically weak toward our sample of cores , these cores do harbor the densest gas within the pipe nebula",
    ". moreover , those cores that show strong ccs emission may be the very youngest within the region .",
    "comparing our measured values for t@xmath9 , the intrinsic @xmath12v , the non - thermal @xmath12v , radius , and column density ( fig .",
    "[ property - comparisons ] ) to those measured in other star forming regions reveals that the cores in the pipe nebula are most similar to cores within perseus ( see figures within @xcite ) .",
    "the obvious difference between the perseus cores and those within the pipe nebula is the derived column densities and the star formation activity : the pipe cores show lower column densities and very little star formation .",
    "the lower nh@xmath1 column densities derived for the pipe cores could arise because of differences in the intrinsic extinction , abundance of nh@xmath1 , or excitation conditions compared to other star - forming regions . because the cores within the pipe nebula span a range in peak extinction and core mass similar to other star - forming regions , it seems unlikey that the lower measured column densities arise simply due to differences in their measured extinction .",
    "moreover , the measured column densities of the cores show an order of magnitude greater range ( 10@xmath5610@xmath55@xmath46 ) compared to the peak extinction ( 520mags ) .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the intrinsic abundance of nh@xmath1 is low within many of these cores , possibly due to their relative chemical youth .",
    "it may be , however , that the excitation conditions with these cores are insufficient to significantly populate the levels .",
    "it is possible that our derived nh@xmath1 column densities are under estimates and that nh@xmath1 is more abundant within the cores , but simply not excited to the levels required for strong detections .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively low mean densities of the cores ( @xmath5 7 @xmath35 10@xmath58@xmath7 ) compared to that necessary to sufficiently populate the observed levels ( @xmath5 10@xmath6@xmath7 ) .",
    "detailed radiative transfer modelling is required to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "if we restrict our sample of cores to those with similar column densities as measured toward other star - forming regions ( i.e. n(nh@xmath1 ) @xmath13 10@xmath45@xmath7 ) , we find that the cores within the pipe share similar properties with cores in both perseus and ophiuchus . given that only 6 cores were detected in the pipe with such high column densities , it is difficult to determine the distribution in their properties with any certainty .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the cores in the pipe nebula are similar to those found in other low - mass star forming regions .",
    "the most noticable difference is that the majority of pipe cores tend to show weaker nh@xmath1 emission and have little star - formation activity .",
    "the chemical characteristics within dense cold cores can reveal their evolutionary stage .",
    "because they have different production chemistries , the column densities of nh@xmath1 , ccs , hc@xmath4n , and can reveal the chemical characteristics in dense cores ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , models for core evolution @xcite predict an anti - correlation between the abundance of ccs and nh@xmath1 ; with ccs more abundant in the early evolutionary phases .    because of the evolutionary effects of depletion and the differences in the molecular distributions within the cores , a single measurement of the column density within the core can only provide limited information on the chemical structure and evolutionary stage .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the comparisons between the column densities of the various species observed within the pipe cores are similar to what is seen toward dense cores in taurus and ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that : ( 1 ) the n(nh@xmath1 ) and n(ccs ) show no clear correlation , which is consistent with differences in the densities of the cores ( 0.52.5@xmath3510@xmath6@xmath7 ) ; ( 2 ) the n ( ) is essentially constant for all values of the n(ccs ) , which implies that the ccs is a more reliable tracer of denser gas ; and ( 3 ) that n(ccs ) and n(hc@xmath4n ) are correlated , which is expected given that these carbon - chain molecules are produced under the same chemical conditions within a core @xcite .",
    "we also find high abundance ratios of [ nh@xmath1 ] compared to [ ] for the densest cores , confirming that nh@xmath1 is a better tracer of dense gas than and that traces the outer core envelope and is depleted in the core centers .",
    "because the chemical abundances trace the evolutionary age of the cores , we can use the fractional abundances of these molecules to estimate the evolutionary ages of the cores . using the model calculations of @xcite",
    ", we estimate the cores are at an evolutionary age of @xmath5 6 @xmath35 10@xmath27 years .",
    "using the 100 m gbt we have conducted an nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) , nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) , ccs ( 2@xmath21@xmath3 ) , and hc@xmath4n ( 9,8 ) survey toward a sample of 46 cores within the pipe nebula .",
    "these cores were identified via their high extinction and appear to be dense starless cores which likely represent the initial conditions of star formation . in total , we detect nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission in 29 cores ( @xmath5  63% ) , nh@xmath1 ( 2,2 ) emission in 10 cores ( @xmath5  22% ) , ccs emission in 13 cores ( @xmath5  28% ) , and hc@xmath4n emission in 4 cores ( @xmath5  9% ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the detection rate is higher toward those cores with higher peak a@xmath11 and higher mass ; in the case of nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) we detected emission toward all cores with a peak a@xmath11@xmath13 15 magnitudes and with masses  @xmath13  11@xmath0 .",
    "we find that the cores are associated with dense ( @xmath1310@xmath6@xmath7 ) gas .",
    "the nh@xmath1 emission revealed n(h@xmath28 ) typically three times greater than the mean densities measured from the extinction maps .",
    "this is expected given that the cores likely have inwardly increasing density gradients ; the nh@xmath1 is tracing the densest centers of the cores .",
    "using a forward - fitting modelling routine , we estimated the physical properties of the gas ( t@xmath9 , @xmath15 , and t@xmath16 ) for 12 cores .",
    "we find that t@xmath9 ranges from 9.5 to 17 k , with a median value of @xmath5 12 @xmath29 2  k. cores with higher mass tend to have lower t@xmath9 values ( 10 @xmath29 1 k ) compared to lower - mass cores ( 13 @xmath29 3 k ) .",
    "the measured one dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath14 , for the cores show that the lines are narrow , with several cores having dispersions close to thermal ( for a 10 k gas ) .",
    "a comparison between the linewidths measured for the cores from and nh@xmath1 , reveal that while the general trends are the same , i.e. neither dataset show a size - linewidth relation , the nh@xmath1 linewidths are systematically lower than those measured from the emission .",
    "this arises because the traces all emission along the line of sight , whereas nh@xmath1 traces only the densest gas associated with the core .",
    "the derived properties of the pipe cores are similar to dense cores within other star - forming regions , i.e.perseus , taurus , ophiuchus .",
    "the most obvious difference is that the cores within the pipe nebula typically have weaker nh@xmath1 emission and most show no evidence for current star formation .",
    "the weak nh@xmath1 emission may arise due to the low abundance of nh@xmath1 because the cores are chemically young or because the excitation conditions ( densities ) within the gas are insufficient to excite the observed transitions .",
    "detailed radiative transfer models are needed to resolve this issue .",
    "although we have a limited number of cores , we estimate their evolutionary ages to be @xmath5 6 @xmath35 10@xmath27 years .",
