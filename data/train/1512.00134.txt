    "the formation of the ice giants uranus and neptune is not well understood . in the favored core accretion theory ,",
    "the gas giant planets like jupiter and saturn are believed to form through the accumulation of small icy planetesimals into solid cores of about 5-@xmath17 in the region beyond the snow - line at @xmath18 @xcite , where the protoplanetary disk is cold enough for ices ( especially water - ice ) to condense .",
    "however , such a scenario is unable to form smaller ice giants like uranus and neptune at their current orbital positions , due to the low density of planetesimals and slow evolution in these orbits @xcite .",
    "one idea is that uranus and neptune formed in the jupiter - saturn region between @xmath19 5 and @xmath1917 au , then migrated outwards to the current position @xcite .",
    "the formation of super - earth exoplanets with neptune - like orbit are even less understood .",
    "this is partly because we do not even know if they exist contrary to the case of neptune .",
    "they are also not expected by the standard core accretion theory due to the same reason as that of ice giants mentioned above @xcite . their formation may be similar to or related to the formation of neptune - like ice giants .",
    "the distribution of such cold ice - giant planets and super - earth in other solar systems is important for understanding the formation of our own cold ice giants .",
    "also , in our own solar system , the distribution of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) is dominated by gravitational interactions with neptune .",
    "since kbos hold large amounts of water and other volatiles needed for life , it could be that exo - neptunes play an important role in the development of life in some exoplanetary systems , whether or not they play this role in our own solar system .    in the 20 years since the first exoplanet discovery @xcite",
    ", there have been repeated discoveries of planets that are quite different from those in our own solar system . however , the detection of planets similar to those in our own solar system has been more difficult .",
    "only jupiter analogs have been detected orbiting solar type stars @xcite , while jupiter / saturn @xcite and venus / earth analogs @xcite have been found orbiting low - mass stars .",
    "very cold , low - mass planets have yet to be explored ( see the distribution of known exoplanets as of 2015 oct . 6 in figure [ fig : a_mp ] ) .",
    "cold ice - giants like uranus and neptune are very difficult to detect with the radial velocity and transit methods owing to their long orbital periods ( 80 - 160 years ) , low orbital velocities and low transit probabilities .",
    "it is even more difficult to detect a super - earth in such wide orbit .",
    "the direct imaging method can detect wide - orbit planets if they are self - luminous , but otherwise , they will be far too faint to detect , especially if they are as small as neptune and super - earth .",
    "recently , low - mass stars ( i.e.  m - dwarfs ) have attracted more interest in exoplanet search programs because of their high detectability of habitable or cold low - mass planets .",
    "_ kepler _ s 150,000 targets contain about 3000 red dwarfs and more than a hundred planetary systems have been found orbiting these stars @xcite .",
    "these results show that smaller planets are more common than larger planets around m - dwarfs , and planets with radii of @xmath191.25 @xmath20 are the most common planets in these systems . @xcite",
    "estimated an occurrence rate of @xmath21 habitable zone earth size planets per m - dwarf , and @xcite found an earth - radius habitable planet around a @xmath190.5 @xmath22 m - dwarf . that smaller planets are more common than larger planets around m - dwarfs may be related to the fact that only small mass proto - planetary disks have been found around such low mass stars @xcite .",
    "the trends high - contrast imaging survey , in combination with radial velocity measurements , indicates that @xmath23 of m - dwarf stars host one or more massive companions with @xmath24 and @xmath25 au , however this survey is not sensitive to cold ice planets @xcite .",
    "the gravitational microlensing method is also sensitive to planets around m - dwarfs and even brown dwarfs because it does not rely on the light from the host stars .",
    "microlensing relies upon random alignments between background source stars and foreground lens star+planet systems , and more massive lens stars are only favored by the factor @xmath26 while smaller masses have shorter timescales which can also bias against detection .",
    "so m - dwarf lens stars dominate microlensing events . contrary to the other methods , microlensing is sensitive to low - mass planets down to an earth - mass @xcite orbiting beyond the snow - line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_mp ] .",
    "microlensing is therefore complementary to the other planet detection techniques .",
    "statistical analyses of microlensing samples indicate that the planet abundance beyond the snow line is about a factor @xmath27 larger than the abundance of close - in planets .",
    "neptune mass planets are more abundant than gas giants around m - dwarfs , and one or more planets per star in total are predicted just beyond the snow - line @xcite .    in about half of the planetary systems found by microlensing ,",
    "the mass of the host and planets and their projected separation have been measured by microlensing parallax in combination with the finite source effect @xcite and/or direct detection of the lens flux by high resolution imaging by adaptive optics ( ao ) @xcite or the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of physical mass and separations of other events have been estimated using a bayesian analysis assuming a galactic model . among the planetary systems with mass measurements , two of them have very low mass hosts , less than @xmath28 and",

    "this is @xmath34 times the snow - line of the host .",

    "but , when the microlensing parallax effect is included , the angle @xmath42 can vary in time , so that @xmath109 . for a wide - separation planetary event , like moa-2013-blg-605 , the light curve basically constrains the microlensing parallax through the three parameters , @xmath107 , @xmath106 , and @xmath72 , which is essentially the time of the stellar peak magnification ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",

    "we can see that most of the parallax signals come from around the planetary signal in both moa - red and ogle-@xmath38 as expected .",
    "for all these models , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are similar to that of the standard model , so the companion is a cold low mass planet .",

    "two additional parameters are required , the orbital eccentricity , @xmath135 and time of perihelion , @xmath136 , which we did not consider here as their inclusion did not improve the fit of the model to the data .",

    "although the linear approximation of the lens motion is good enough in most of the cases , this parameterization inadvertently assumed the uniform prior on all microlensing fitting parameters , which is not physically justified .",

    "[ sec : parallax ] , the parallax signal looks qualitatively real because the signal come from the theoretically expected part of the light curve and it is consistent in both moa and ogle-@xmath38 datasets .",
    "the @xmath54 improvement by the parallax - only models over the standard model are @xmath233 with 2 additional parameters , which is equivalent to a confidence level of 5.4@xmath195.8@xmath232 and is formally significant .",
    "furthermore , we compared the models by using the common statistical criteria , akaike s information criterion ( aic ) , @xmath234 , and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , @xmath235 ) @xcite , which includes a penalty discouraging an overfitting .",
    "the smaller the @xmath236 and/or @xmath237 values are the better model is . here",
    "we adopt the number of data points @xmath238 during the event at @xmath239 for @xmath237 because the baseline data outside of this range do not constrain the parallax signal .",
    "the differences in these criteria between the parallax - only models and standard model are @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "thus the parallax - only models are better than the standard model .",
    "the parallax models with linear orbit ( @xmath242 ) are also better than standard model by @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "the parallax models with full keplerian orbit with two more parameters are better than the standard in @xmath236 but not in @xmath237 .",
    "the @xmath113 of the parallax models with linear orbit ( @xmath242 ) relative to the parallax - only models are only marginal of @xmath245 with two additional parameters .",
    "the differences in these criteria are @xmath246 and @xmath247 , and it is worse for the full keplerian orbit with two more parameters .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the orbital motion is not justified by these criteria .    however , the reason that we must introduce the orbital motion is not to improve the goodness of the fit , but to avoid the bias of the value and the underestimate of the uncertainty in parallax parameters due to the known degeneracy between the parallax and the lens orbital motion as shown in section  [ sec : linearorbitalmotion ] .    furthermore , even though the full keplerian orbit does not improve the goodness of the fit with two additional parametes , its incorporation has the following benefits .",
    "as skowron et al ( 2011 ) noted , in addition to being more accurate , the advantage of the full keplerian orbit is to avoid all unbound orbital solutions ( with eccentricity @xmath248 ) and to enable the introduction of priors on the values of orbital parameters directly into mcmc calculations .",
    "if the uncertainty of the parameters are relatively large like in this event , the density distribution of the mcmc chain depends on the prior probability of the fitting parameters in mcmc .",
    "however , the linear orbital motion parameterization inadvertently assumed the uniform prior on all microlensing fitting parameters , which is not physically justified . on the other hand ,",
    "the full keplerian orbit parameterization enable us to properly weigh the mcmc chains with physically justified priors .",
    "we conducted the modeling with three different sets of relatively realistic priors including the keplerian prior , i.e. , k@xmath187 , k@xmath96 , and k@xmath220 .",
    "we think that the model k@xmath96 is more realistic than k@xmath187 as the galactic kinematics constraint is applied .",
    "the models with the galactic mass density prior k@xmath220 may also be useful , but we do not know if the assumption that the distribution of the planetary systems is uniform throughout the galaxy is valid .",
    "thus we adopt the k@xmath96 models as our main results of this paper .",
    "it is important to note that the results of all these models k@xmath187 , k@xmath96 , and k@xmath220 , are basically same within their errors , thus our main conclusion does not depend on the choice of these priors .    among the models in k@xmath96 , the low - mass brown dwarf models , i.e. , p@xmath125k@xmath96 and p@xmath126k@xmath96",

    "the m - dwarf models , p@xmath124k@xmath187 , p@xmath124k@xmath96 and p@xmath124k@xmath220 have @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and @xmath320 , which are 1.6 , 1.7 and 2.1 @xmath232 brighter than the keck measurement .",
    "furthermore , these are 2.0 , 2.0 and 2.4 @xmath232 brighter when those include the lens ( host ) brightness ( @xcite ) of @xmath321 ( @xmath322 , @xmath323kpc ) , @xmath324 ( @xmath325 , @xmath326kpc ) and @xmath327 ( @xmath328 , @xmath329kpc ) , respectively .",
    "these comparisons of the keck result and source magnitudes from the light curve indicate that the lens is very faint and not detected .",
    "this is consistent with the physical solutions from the parallax measurements that the host is a low - mass m - dwarf or a brown dwarf mentioned in section [ sec : property ] .",
    "the low - mass brown dwarf models are slightly preferred .",
    "the @xmath250 of the standard model is consistent to the keck results , but we concluded that the parallax models are better as discussed in  [ sec : model_selection ] .    as mentioned in section [ sec : galactic_prior ] , there are two minima with a much smaller parallax value of @xmath223 for the p@xmath116k@xmath220 models .",
    "in addition to the rarity of their heavy host mass of @xmath330 which might be a stellar remnant , their source magnitudes @xmath331 and @xmath332 are 2.9@xmath232 and 3.2@xmath232 brighter than the keck measurement .",
    "so these models are not likely real .",
    "if their host is a main sequence star , then total brightness of the source plus lens are ruled out by keck measurement by more than 4@xmath232 .",
    "let us consider the prospects for resolving the degeneracy and characterizing the host and the planet .",
    "in the first epoch of keck ao observations , we could not detect any excess light , which confirmed the lens is faint . if the second epoch is taken by _",
    "hst _ or ao observations , then we may directly detect the host ( or possibly its companion ) .",
    "we can then measure the lens mass and distance or place a stronger upper limit on the lens mass .    in table",
    "[ tbl : physical]-[tbl : physical26 ] , the geocentric proper motions are reported as @xmath333 mas yr@xmath149 . the heliocentric proper motion is given by @xcite ,    @xmath334    where @xmath335 kms@xmath149 is the velocity of the earth projected on the plane of the sky at the peak of the event .",
    "the estimated @xmath336 of each model is shown in table [ tbl : physical]-[tbl : physical26 ] , and they are about @xmath337 masyr@xmath149 . hence it is clear that the lens will be separately resolved by _ hst _ or ao observations in 5 - 10 years time given a diffraction limit of 50 mas . or , if we do not see any luminous object , then the lens is a sub - stellar object .    not only the value but also the direction of expected relative proper motion would help us to know if it was the lens or just an ambient star when we detect such star at 80mas from the source 10 years later .",
    "there are three physical planetary solutions for the moa-2013-blg-605l system .",
    "one comprises a neptune - mass planet at a wide separation from a very low mass m - dwarf host star , having a very similar temperature as neptune when the planet was formed .",
    "the second solution comprises a mini - neptune around a high - mass brown dwarf which is even colder than neptune when it was formed .",
    "the third one is a super - earth around a low - mass brown dwarf .",
    "these degenerate solutions may be resolved by future high resolution imaging of the lens by the _ hst _ or ground - based telescopes using adaptive optics , after waiting a period of time for the positions of the lens and the source to diverge .",
    "we may detect an m - dwarf lens host star , but we do not expect to detect a brown dwarf host star by such direct imaging .    in either case , the host is one of the three least massive main sequence stars orbited by a planet for which the planet s mass was measured and for which the planet - host mass ratio is @xmath29 . the other low host mass , low planet mass systems are moa-2007-blg-192l ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath338 au ) @xcite , moa-2010-blg-328l ( @xmath339au ) @xcite .",
    "these planets found around very low mass ( @xmath340 ) hosts have relatively small masses themselves , ranging from super - earth mass to neptune mass .",
    "in contrast , a roughly equal number of giant planets and planets with neptune - mass or less have been found across the whole mass range of host stars .",
    "this may imply that the formation of gas giants is more difficult around very low mass stars compared to average k - m dwarf stars with masses of @xmath341 , which is the typical host star for microlensing planets .",
    "this is somewhat as predicted by the core accretion model of planetary formation , but this work provides the first observational evidence supporting this prediction .",
    "this could be the first exoplanet around a brown dwarf with a mass measurement having a planetary mass - ratio @xmath342 .",
    "there are three brown dwarf binaries where one of the components is in the planetary mass regime @xcite . however , their mass ratios are large @xmath343 , suggesting that their formation may be considered more akin to binary formation than planetary formation .",
    "the separation of the planet is very wide , @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 times larger than the snow line of @xmath190.5(@xmath344 ) au , @xmath190.2(@xmath345 ) or @xmath190.08(@xmath346 ) au , respectively , as seen in figure [ fig : a_mp ] .",
    "the effective temperature of the planet when it was formed , based on the host mass and the planet - host separation , is @xmath347k , @xmath348k or @xmath27k , the coldest planet found to date apart from those planets found by the direct imaging method , which can presently only find heavy gas - giant planets of more than a few jupiter masses .",
    "the effective temperature of these heavy gas - giants are a few hundreds k or higher due to their internal heat . in either interpretation",
    ", planet moa-2013-blg-605 lb is orbiting around one of the least massive objects found to date at a very wide separation .",
    "the planet is the coldest exoplanet discovered so far .",
    "this is the first observed example of a neptune - like exoplanet in terms of mass and temperature or a super - earth with neptune - like temperature , which are important factors in any planetary formation theory .",
    "the probability of detecting such wide separation low mass planets is very low , even by microlensing .",
    "the probability of a source crossing the planetary caustic is proportional to the size of the planetary caustic , @xmath349 @xcite , divided by half the circle with radius of separation @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath350 .",
    "it is an order of magnitude smaller than planets at @xmath351 , where @xmath352 planets with neptune - mass or less have been found by microlensing .",
    "this may imply that such low - mass planets with masses less than that of neptune at @xmath353 are as common as low - mass planets at a few times of the snow line @xcite .",
    "this conclusion may challenge the standard core accretion model and other formation models @xcite which predict few low - mass planets with neptune - like orbit at @xmath35410 @xmath1 .",
    "more accurate measurements of the abundance and distribution of such low - mass ice planets are very important in the study of the formation of neptune and in the study of planet formation mechanisms in general . the microlensing exoplanet search by nasa s wfirst satellite is expected to detect hundreds of low mass planets with neptune - like orbit and will constrain further planetary formation models .",

    "<S> the 3-d planet - host separations are 4.6@xmath11 au , 2.1@xmath12 au and 0.94@xmath13 au , which are @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 times larger than @xmath1 for these models , respectively . the keck ao observation confirm that the lens is faint . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery suggests that low - mass planets with neptune - like orbit are common . </S>",
    "<S> so processes similar to the one that formed neptune in our own solar system or cold super - earth may be common in other solar systems . </S>"
