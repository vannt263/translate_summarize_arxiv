    "<S> the interaction of mesoscopic interference devices with nonclassical electromagnetic fields is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the external quantum fields induce a phase factor on the electric charges . this phase factor , which is a generalization of the standard aharonov - bohm phase factor , is in the case of nonclassical electromagnetic fields a quantum mechanical operator . </S>",
    "<S> its expectation value depends on the density matrix describing the nonclassical photons and determines the interference . </S>",
    "<S> several examples are discussed , which show that the quantum noise of the nonclassical photons destroys slightly the electron interference fringes . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting application arises in the context of distant electron interference devices , irradiated with entangled photons . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the interfering electrons in the two devices become entangled . </S>",
    "<S> the same ideas are applied in the context of squid rings irradiated with nonclassical electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the statistics of the cooper pairs tunneling through the josephson junction depend on the statistics of the photons . </S>"
