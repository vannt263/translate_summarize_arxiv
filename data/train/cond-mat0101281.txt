    "recently the interest in the thermo - statistical behaviour of non - extensive many - body systems , like atomic nuclei , atomic clusters , soft - matter , biological systems  and also self - gravitating astro - physical systems lead to consider thermo - statistics without using the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is most safely done by going back to boltzmann .",
    "einstein calls boltzmann s definition of entropy as e.g. written on his famous epitaph @xmath8 as boltzmann s principle @xcite from which boltzmann was able to deduce thermodynamics . here",
    "@xmath9 is the number of micro - states at given energy @xmath10 of the @xmath11-body system in the spatial volume @xmath12 : @xmath13\\label{partitsum}\\\\ tr[\\delta(e-\\hat h_n)]&=&\\int_{\\{q\\subset v\\}}{\\frac{1}{n ! } \\left(\\frac{d^3q\\;d^3p } { ( 2\\pi\\hbar)^3}\\right)^n\\delta(e-\\hat h_n)},\\label{phasespintegr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 is a suitable energy constant to make @xmath9 dimensionless , @xmath15 is the @xmath11-particle hamilton - function and the @xmath11 positions @xmath16 are restricted to the volume @xmath12 , whereas the momenta @xmath17 are unresticted . in",
    "what follows , we remain on the level of classical mechanics .",
    "the only reminders of the underlying quantum mechanics are the measure of the phase space in units of @xmath18 and the factor @xmath19 which respects the indistinguishability of the particles ( gibbs paradoxon ) .",
    "in contrast to boltzmann @xcite who used the principle only for dilute gases and to schrdinger @xcite , who thought equation ( [ boltzmentr1 ] ) is useless otherwise , i take the principle as _ the fundamental , generic definition of entropy_. in a recent book @xcite cf .",
    "also @xcite i demonstrated that this definition of thermo - statistics works well especially also at higher densities and at phase transitions without invoking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "before we proceed we must comment on einstein s attitude to the principle @xcite ) : originally , boltzmann called @xmath9 the `` wahrscheinlichkeit '' ( probability ) , i.e. the relative time a system spends ( along a time - dependent path ) in a given region of @xmath6-dim . phase space .",
    "our interpretation of @xmath9 to be the number of `` complexions '' ( boltzmann s second interpretation ) or quantum states ( trace ) with the same energy was criticized by einstein @xcite as artificial .",
    "it is exactly that criticized interpretation of @xmath9 which i use here and which works so excellently @xcite . in section [ einsteineps ]",
    "i will come back to this fundamental point .    after succeeding to deduce equilibrium statistics including all phenomena of phase transitions from boltzmann s principle even for `` small '' systems , i.e. non - extensive many - body systems",
    ", it is challenging to explore how far this `` most conservative and restrictive way to thermodynamics '' @xcite is able to describe also the _ approach _ of ( eventially `` small '' ) systems to equilibrium and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "thermodynamics describes the development of _ macroscopic _ features of many - body systems without specifying them microscopically in all details .",
    "before we address the second law , we have to clarify what we mean with the label `` macroscopic observable '' .",
    "a single point @xmath20 in the @xmath11-body phase space corresponds to a detailed specification of the system with all degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) completely fixed at time @xmath21 ( microscopic determination ) .",
    "fixing only the total energy @xmath10 of an @xmath11-body system leaves the other ( @xmath22)-degrees of freedom unspecified .",
    "a second system with the same energy is most likely not in the same microscopic state as the first , it will be at another point in phase space , the other d.o.f .",
    "will be different .",
    "i.e. the measurement of the total energy @xmath23 , or any other macroscopic observable @xmath2 , determines a ( @xmath22)-dimensional _ sub - manifold _ @xmath24 or @xmath4 in phase space .",
    "all points in @xmath11-body phase space consistent with the given value of @xmath10 and volume @xmath12 , i.e. all points in the ( @xmath22)-dimensional sub - manifold @xmath25 of phase space are equally consistent with this measurement .",
    "@xmath25 is the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this example tells us that _ any macroscopic measurement is incomplete and defines a sub - manifold of points in phase space not a single point_. an additional measurement of another macroscopic quantity @xmath26 reduces @xmath24 further to the cross - section @xmath27 , a ( @xmath28)-dimensional subset of points in @xmath24 with the volume : @xmath29 if @xmath30 as also @xmath31 are continuous differentiable functions of their arguments , what we assume in the following , @xmath32 is closed . in the following we use @xmath9 for the riemann or liouville volume of a many - fold .",
    "microcanonical thermo_statics _ gives the probability @xmath33 to find the @xmath11-body system in the sub - manifold @xmath34 : @xmath35-s(e , n , v ) } \\label { eps } \\ ] ] this is what krylov seems to have had in mind @xcite and what i will call the `` ensemble probabilistic formulation of statistical mechanics ( @xmath36 ) '' .",
    "similarly thermo_dynamics _ describes the development of some macroscopic observable @xmath37 in time of a system which was specified at an earlier time @xmath38 by another macroscopic measurement @xmath39 .",
    "it is related to the volume of the sub - manifold @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of trajectories solving the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath43 with the initial conditions @xmath44 . for a very large system with @xmath45 the probability to find a given value @xmath46 , @xmath47 , is usually sharply peaked as function of @xmath48 .",
    "ordinary thermodynamics treats systems in the thermodynamic limit @xmath49 and gives only @xmath50 .",
    "however , here we are interested to formulate the second law for `` small '' systems i.e. we are interested in the whole distribution @xmath47 not only in its mean value @xmath50 .",
    "thermodynamics does _ not _ describe the temporal development of a _ single _ system ( single point in the @xmath6-dim phase space ) .",
    "there is an important property of macroscopic measurements : whereas the macroscopic constraint @xmath39 determines ( usually ) a compact region @xmath51 in \\{@xmath52 } this does not need to be the case at later times @xmath53 : @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 might become a _ fractal _ i.e. `` spaghetti - like '' manifold as a function of @xmath56 in @xmath24 at @xmath57 and loose compactness .",
    "this can be expressed in mathematical terms : there exist series of points @xmath58 which converge to a point @xmath59 which is _ not _ in @xmath54 .",
    "e.g. such points @xmath59 may have intruded from the phase space complimentary to @xmath51 .",
    "illustrative examples for this evolution of an initially compact sub - manifold into a fractal set are the baker transformation discussed in this context by ref . @xcite",
    ". then no macroscopic ( incomplete ) measurement at time @xmath21 can resolve @xmath59 from its immediate neighbors @xmath60 in phase space with distances @xmath61 less then any arbitrary small @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , _ at the time @xmath53 no macroscopic measurement with its incomplete information about @xmath56 can decide whether @xmath63 or not .",
    "_ i.e. any macroscopic theory like thermodynamics can only deal with the _ closure _ of @xmath54 .",
    "if necessary , the sub - manifold @xmath54 must be artificially closed to @xmath64 as developed further in section [ fractsl ] .",
    "_ clearly , in this approach this is the physical origin of irreversibility .",
    "_ we come back to this in section [ fractsl ] .",
    "according to abraham pais : `` subtle is the lord''@xcite , einstein was critical with regard to the definition of relative probabilities by eq .",
    "[ eps ] , boltzmann s counting of `` complexions '' .",
    "he considered it as artificial and not corresponding to the immediate picture of probability used in the actual problem : `` the word probability is used in a sense that does not conform to its definition as given in the theory of probability .",
    "in particular , cases of equal probability are often hypothetically defined in instances where the theoretical pictures used are sufficiently definite to give a deduction rather than a hypothetical assertion '' @xcite .",
    "he preferred to define probability by the relative time a system ( a trajectory of a single point moving with time in the @xmath11-body phase space ) spends in a subset of the phase space . however , is this really the immediate picture of probability used in statistical mechanics ?",
    "this definition demands the ergodicity of the trajectory in phase space . as we discussed above ,",
    "thermodynamics as any other macroscopic theory handles incomplete , macroscopic informations of the @xmath11-body system .",
    "it handles , consequently , the temporal evolution of _ finite sized sub - manifolds _ - ensembles - not single points in phase space .",
    "the _ typical _ outcomes of macroscopic measurements are calculated .",
    "nobody waits in a macroscopic measurement , e.g. of the temperature , long enough that an atom can cross the whole system .    in this respect ,",
    "i think the eps version of statistical mechanics is closer to the experimental situation than the duration - time of a single trajectory .",
    "moreover , in an experiment on a small system like a nucleus , the excited nucleus , which then may fragment statistically later on , is produced by a multiple _ repetition _ of scattering events and statistical averages are taken .",
    "no ergodic covering of the whole phase space by a single trajectory in time is demanded . at the high excitations of the nuclei in the fragmentation region",
    "their life - time would bo too short for that .",
    "this is analogous to the statistics of a falling ball on a galton s nail - board where also a single trajectory is not touching all nails but is random . only after many repetitions",
    "the smooth binomial distribution is established .",
    "as i am discussing here the second law in _",
    "finite _ systems , this is the correct scenario , not the time average over a single ergodic trajectory .",
    "here we will first describe a simple working - scheme ( i.e. a sufficient method ) which allows to deduce mathematically the second law .",
    "later , we will show how this method is necessarily implied by the reduced information obtainable by macroscopic measurements .",
    "let us examine the following gedanken experiment : suppose the probability to find our system at points @xmath65 in phase space is uniformly distributed for times @xmath66 over the sub - manifold @xmath67 of the @xmath11-body phase space at energy @xmath10 and spatial volume @xmath68 . at time @xmath69 we allow the system to spread over the larger volume @xmath70 without changing its energy .",
    "if the system is _ dynamically mixing _ , the majority of trajectories @xmath65 in phase space starting from points @xmath71 with @xmath72 at @xmath38 will now spread over the larger volume @xmath73 .",
    "of course the liouvillean measure of the distribution @xmath74 in phase space at @xmath69 will remain the same ( @xmath75 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "( the label @xmath76 of the integral means that the positions @xmath77 are restricted to the volume @xmath68 , the momenta @xmath78 are unrestricted . )",
    "@xmath79 \\right|_{\\{q_0\\subset v_1\\ } } & = & \\int_{\\{q_0\\{q_t , p_t\\}\\subset v_1\\}}{\\frac{1}{n!}\\left(\\frac{d^3q_t\\;d^3p_t } { ( 2\\pi\\hbar)^3}\\right)^n\\epsilon_0\\delta(e-\\hat h_n\\{q_t , p_t\\})}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{\\{q_0\\subset v_1\\}}{\\frac{1}{n!}\\left(\\frac{d^3q_0\\ ; d^3p_0}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3}\\right)^n\\epsilon_0\\delta(e-\\hat h_n\\{q_0,p_0\\})},\\\\ \\mbox{because of : } \\frac{\\partial\\{q_t , p_t\\}}{\\partial\\{q_0,p_0\\}}&=&1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but as already argued by gibbs the distribution @xmath74 will be filamented like ink in water and will approach any point of @xmath80 arbitrarily close .",
    "@xmath74 becomes dense in the new , larger @xmath80 for times sufficiently larger than @xmath38 .",
    "the closure @xmath81 becomes equal to @xmath80 .",
    "this is clearly expressed by lebowitz @xcite .    in order to express this fact mathematically , _ we have to redefine boltzmann s definition of entropy eq.([boltzmentr1 ] ) and",
    "introduce the following fractal `` measure '' for integrals like ( [ phasespintegr ] ) or ( [ integrm ] ) : _ @xmath82 with the transformation : @xmath83 we replace @xmath4 by its closure @xmath7 and _ define _ now : @xmath84,\\label{boxm1}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the average of @xmath86 over the ( larger ) manifold @xmath80 , and @xmath87 $ ] is the box - counting volume of @xmath88 which the same as the volume of @xmath7 , see below .    to obtain @xmath87 $ ] we cover the @xmath89-dim .",
    "sub - manifold @xmath90 , here with @xmath91 , of the phase space by a grid with spacing @xmath62 and count the number @xmath92 of boxes of size @xmath93 , which contain points of @xmath94 .",

    "this is illustrated by the following figure",
    "@xmath98@xmath99    @xmath66    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath69    with this extension of eq.([phasespintegr ] ) boltzmann s entropy ( [ boltzmentr1 ] ) is at time @xmath53 equal to the logarithm of the _ larger _ phase space @xmath102 .",
    "_ this is the second law of thermodynamics . _",
    "the box - counting is also used in the definition of the kolmogorov entropy , the average rate of entropy gain @xcite .",
    "of course still at @xmath38 @xmath103 : @xmath104    the box - counting volume is analogous to the standard method to determine the fractal dimension of a set of points @xcite by the box - counting dimension : @xmath105:=\\underbar{$\\lim$}_{\\delta\\to 0 } \\frac{\\ln{n_\\delta[{\\cal{m}}(e , n , t\\gg t_0)]}}{-\\ln{\\delta}}\\\\\\ ] ]    like the box - counting dimension , @xmath106 has the peculiarity that it is equal to the volume of the smallest _ closed _ covering set .",
    "e.g. : the box - counting volume of the set of rational numbers @xmath107 between @xmath108 and @xmath109 , is @xmath110 , and thus equal to the measure of the _ real _ numbers , c.f .",
    "falconer @xcite section 3.1 .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath106 is not a measure in its mathematical definition because then we should have @xmath111= \\sum_{i\\subset\\{\\bf   q\\}}\\mbox{vol}_{box}[{\\cal{m}}_i]=0,\\ ] ] therefore the quotation marks for the box - counting `` measure '' .",
    "coming back to the the end of section ( [ epsformulation ] ) , the volume @xmath112 of the relevant ensemble , the _ closure _",
    "@xmath113 must be `` measured '' by something like the box - counting `` measure '' ( [ boxvol],[boxm ] ) with the box - counting integral @xmath114 , which must replace the integral in eq.([phasespintegr ] ) . due to the fact that the box - counting volume is equal to",
    "the volume of the smallest closed covering set , the new , extended , definition of the phase - space integral eq.([boxm ] ) is for compact sets like the equilibrium distribution @xmath24 identical to the old one eq.([phasespintegr ] ) and nothing changes for equilibrium statistics .",
    "therefore , one can simply replace the old boltzmann - definition of the number of complexions and with it of the entropy by the new one ( [ boxm ] ) .",
    "macroscopic measurements @xmath2 determine only a very few of all @xmath6 d.o.f .",
    "any macroscopic theory like thermodynamics deals with the _ volumes _ @xmath5 of the corresponding closed sub - manifolds @xmath7 in the @xmath6-dim .",
    "phase space not with single points .",
    "the averaging over ensembles or finite sub - manifolds in phase space becomes especially important for the microcanonical ensemble of a _ finite _ system .",
    "because of this necessarily coarsed information , macroscopic measurements , and with it also macroscopic theories are unable to distinguish fractal sets @xmath4 from their closures @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , i make the conjecture : the proper manifolds determined by a macroscopic theory like thermodynamics are the closed @xmath7",
    ". however , an initially closed subset of points at time @xmath38 does not necessarily evolve again into a closed subset at @xmath53 .",
    "i.e. the closure operation and the @xmath115 limit do not commute , and the macroscopic dynamics becomes irreversible .",
    "here is the origin of the misunderstanding by the famous reversibility paradoxes which were invented by loschmidt @xcite and zermelo @xcite and which bothered boltzmann so much @xcite .",
    "these paradoxes address to trajectories of _ single points _ in the @xmath11-body phase space which must return after poincarre s recurrence time or which must run backwards if all momenta are exactly reversed .",
    "therefore , loschmidt and zermelo concluded that the entropy should decrease as well as it was increasing before .",
    "the specification of a single point demands of course a _",
    "microscopic exact _ specification of all @xmath6 degrees of freedom not a determination of a few macroscopic degrees of freedom only .",
    "no entropy is defined for a single point .    this way various non - trivial limiting processes can be avoided .",
    "neither does one invoke the thermodynamic limit of a homogeneous system with infinitely many particles nor does one rely on the ergodic hypothesis of the equivalence of ( very long ) time averages and ensemble averages . _",
    "the use of ensemble averages is justified directly by the very nature of macroscopic ( incomplete ) measurements_. coarse - graining appears as natural consequence of this .",
    "the box - counting method mirrors the averaging over the overwhelming number of non - determined degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , a fully consistent theory must use this averaging explicitly . then one would not depend on the order of the limits @xmath116 as it was tacitly assumed here .",
    "presumably , the rise of the entropy can then be already seen at finite times when the fractality of the distribution in phase space is not yet fully developed .",
    "the coarse - graining is no more any mathematical ad hoc assumption .",
    "moreover the second law is in the eps - formulation of statistical mechanics not linked to the thermodynamic limit as was thought up to now @xcite .",
    "thanks to a.ecker for mathematical advises .",
    "i am especially grateful to e.g.d.cohen for his interest and his constructive criticism of the ideas developed here .",
    "he turned my attention to the fundamental discussions in pais book about einsteins view of statistical mechanics .",
    "it was through the many letters exchanged with cohen that i realized how much my way to statistical mechanics was not so self - evident as i thought and departs from the main stream founded by boltzmann and einstein .",
    "he convinced me to express the fundamental ideas in detail .",
    "i hope this paper serves this purpose .",
    "the many applications to realistic problems especially to phase transitions in `` small '' systems are given in my book @xcite ."
