    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite provides a systematic expansion of the heavy hadron spectra and transition amplitude in terms of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the heavy quark mass . the spectrum pf the ground state heavy meson has been studied with the qcd sum rules @xcite in hqet in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the mass of the lowest excited heavy meson doublets @xmath1 and @xmath10 were studied with qcd sum rules in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) up to the order of @xmath11 .",
    "the qcd sum rules was used to analyse the exclusive radiative @xmath12-decays with the help of the light - cone vector meson wave function in @xcite . with the same formalism",
    "the off - shell @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings were calculated in @xcite . in this work",
    "we employ the light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) in hqet to calculate the decay widths of the processes @xmath15 to the leading order of @xmath16 . when the lcqsr is used to calculate the coupling constant , the double borel transformation",
    "is always invoked so that the excited states and the continuum contribution can be treated quite nicely .",
    "one difficult problem encountered in studying the decay widths of excited heavy mesons is due to the degeneracy of the spectra .",
    "there are a pair of states for any spin - parity @xmath17 with close values in their masses but quite different in magnitudes of their decay widths , except for the ground states . only in the @xmath18 limit , is there a conserved quantum number @xmath19 , the angular momentum of the light component , which can be used to differentiate the two states",
    ". therefore , hqet has important and unique advantage for this purpose .",
    "these are the motivation for our approach of using lcqsr in hqet .",
    "the proper interpolating current @xmath20 for the states with the quantum number @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 in hqet was given in @xcite .",
    "they were proved to satisfy the following conditions @xmath23&&\\times\\ : \\int \\,dt\\delta(x - vt)\\:\\pi_{p , j_{\\ell}}(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath18 limit , where @xmath24 is the polarization tensor for the spin @xmath21 state , @xmath25 is the velocity of the heavy quark , @xmath26 is the transverse metric tensor , @xmath27 denotes symmetrizing the indices and subtracting the trace terms separately in the sets @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are a constant and a function of @xmath32 respectively which depend only on @xmath22 and @xmath33 .",
    "because of equations ( [ decay ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) , the sum rule in hqet for decay widths derived from a correlator containing such currents receive no contribution from the unwanted states with the same spin - parity as the states under consideration in the @xmath18 .",
    "in the present work we shall confine ourselves to the leading order of @xmath8 expansion . denote the doublet @xmath1 with @xmath34 by @xmath35 . from covariance and conservation of the angular momentum of the light component in the @xmath18 limit ,",
    "there are three independent decay amplitudes for the decays of @xmath5 , @xmath36 to the rho meson and the ground states @xmath12 , @xmath37 in the doublet @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "they are characterized by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the orbital and total angular momentum of the rho meson respectively @xcite .",
    "the s - wave amplitude is dominant .",

    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 for the charged and neutral rho meson respectively .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in ( [ coup1])-([coup4 ] ) corresponds to the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 decay amplitude respectively .    due to the heavy quark symmetry",
    "the d - wave and s - wave amplitudes in these four processes are related . from vector current conservation",
    "we have another constraint .",
    "for example , vector current conservation requires that the tensor structure be @xmath61 for the process @xmath62 . from this condition",

    "we calculate the correlator ( [ 7d ] ) by the operator expansion on the light - cone in hqet to the leading order of @xmath16 .",
    "the expression with the tensor structure reads : @xmath86    the rho wave function is defined as the matrix elements of nonlocal operators between the vacuum and rho meson state .",
    "up to twist four the dirac components of the rho meson wave function are @xcite : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 due to the choice of the gauge @xmath90 , the path - ordered gauge factor + @xmath91 has been omitted .",
    "the wave functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the leading twist distributions in the fraction of total momentum carried by the quark in the transversely and longitudinally polarised rho meson respectively .",

    "the rho meson coupling constants were determined from qcd sum rule analysis : @xmath113mev @xcite .    expressing ( [ lam5 ] ) with the rho light - cone wave functions , we arrive at : @xmath114    smilarly for the other d - wave functions in ( [ 7a])-([7c ] )",

    "@xmath122g_d(\\omega,\\omega ' ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] from the above relations we know there are two independent coupling constants only .",
    "this is in agreement with the discussions above .    in order to extract @xmath66",
    "we first make wick rotation , then make double borel transformation to eliminate the single - pole terms in ( [ pole ] ) . subtracting the continuum contribution which is modeled by the dispersion integral in region @xmath123 , we arrive at : @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 are the borel parameters corresponding to the variables @xmath128 respectively . in obtaining ( [ final - a ] )",
    "we have used the borel transformation formula : @xmath129 .    for the coupling constant @xmath67 , we have : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the factor used to subtract the continuum .",
    "the derivative in ( [ final - b ] ) arises from the factor @xmath132 in ( [ r7 ] ) . we have used integration by parts to absorb the factor @xmath132 . in this way",
    "we arrive at the simple form after double borel transformation .",
    "in order to obtain the coupling constants from ( [ final - a ] ) and ( [ final - b ] ) we need to use the mass parameters @xmath133 s and the coupling constants @xmath134 s of the corresponding interpolating currents as input . @xmath135 and",

    "the mass difference between @xmath4 and @xmath148 doublets is about @xmath149gev in the leading order of hqet , which is much smaller than the large value of @xmath127 used below , @xmath150gev .",
    "so such a choice is reasonable .",
    "the values of the various functions appearing in ( [ final - a ] ) , at @xmath151 , are : @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we now turn to the numerical evaluation of the sum rules for the coupling constants .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath156 is constrained by the requirement that the continuum contribution is less than @xmath157 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath158gev .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath156 is at the point of t where stability develops .",
    "this leads to @xmath159 gev for the sum rules ( [ final - a ] ) .",

    "the results are plotted as curves in fig . 1 and 2 with @xmath166 gev .      with the values of f s in ( [ fvalue ] ) , we get",

    "note @xmath179 .",
    "we apply the leading order formulas obtained above to the excited states of charmed mesons assuming the hqet holds well for the charm system .",
    "the value @xmath180 for these processes in ( [ widths ] ) are calculated from the experimental mass values of the relevent particles @xcite .",
