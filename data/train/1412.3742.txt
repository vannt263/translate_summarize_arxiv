    "this work deals with positive solutions of the boundary value problem @xmath0 where @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are constants and @xmath4 is a _ weight _ function indefinite in sign which is defined as @xmath5 \\cr     -\\nu c & \\hbox{if}\\;\\ ;    t\\in(1-\\alpha,1 ] \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as a consequence , the problem is sublinear in some regions of the domain , while it is superlinear in others ; for this reason it is referred to as _ superlinear indefinite_.    observe that , when @xmath9 , the weight @xmath4 is symmetric in @xmath10 . for such choice , in @xcite , it was proven that if @xmath11 is sufficiently negative , there exists a value of @xmath12 such that problem admits , for such choices of the parameters , an arbitrarily high number of solutions . moreover , considering @xmath12 as main bifurcation parameter , the structure of the bifurcation diagrams was determined , showing that they consist of a _ primary branch _ which possesses a certain number of turning points and contains symmetric solutions , and a number of _ secondary loops _ bifurcating from it and containing asymmetric solutions .",
    "the analysis is based on the following observation : consider the set of all the positive solutions of the problem in the external intervals @xmath13 and @xmath14 $ ] @xmath15 which will be denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . then , if we define the following sets of points in the phase plane @xmath18 there is a @xmath19 correspondence between positive solutions of and positive solutions of @xmath20 which satisfy @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as a consequence",
    ", the study is reduced to consider in the phase plane associated to all the possible poincar maps that allow to connect @xmath23 to @xmath24 in a range of @xmath25 , which is the amplitude of the central interval @xmath26 ( observe that is invariant by translations of the independent variable ) .    when @xmath27 , the weight @xmath4 is no longer symmetric and the global structure of the bifurcation diagrams in @xmath12 of the solutions of was determined in @xcite , showing that they are not connected but exhibit an arbitrarily high number of bounded components , referred to as _ isolas_. as @xmath28 perturbs from @xmath29 it is natural to expect that the secondary bifurcations occurring on the primary branch for @xmath9 transform into _",
    "imperfect bifurcations_. such phenomenon has not been considered in @xcite , though it has been already detected numerically for problem in @xcite and studied in general situations in @xcite .",
    "however , the sufficient conditions for imperfect bifurcations provided in @xcite , which are in the spirit of the functional - analytical transversality condition of the celebrated paper of m. g. crandall and p. h. rabinowitz @xcite , can not be tested in our situation , since the bifurcation points in @xcite are constructed with the topological techniques described above .",
    "for this reason , we use here the same technique to prove the occurrence of imperfect bifurcations .",
    "the work is distributed like follows : in section [ section2 ] we recall some results of @xcite related to the geometry of the phase plane of the sublinear and superlinear problems ; in section [ section3 ] we provide the elements of @xcite that allow to construct the bifurcation points in the symmetric case and in section [ section4 ] we study the imperfect bifurcations in the asymmetric one .",
    "we start by recalling from ( * ? ? ? * section 2 ) the geometry of the flow of the sublinear problems , describing the set of points in the phase plane @xmath30 reached at time @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",

    "performing the change of variable @xmath45 , which entails a change of sign of the first derivatives of the solutions , we obtain immediately a counterpart of proposition [ pr21 ] for problem ( b ) . as a consequence ,",
    "maintaining the notation of , the sets @xmath23 and @xmath24 are differentiable curves whose relative position , thanks to proposition [ pr21](iii ) , is like shown in figure [ fig1 ] . in particular , they intersect in a point @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +    from the previous argument , we have that , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 produces a subcritical turning point for a certain value of @xmath12 smaller than @xmath50 , precisely the one for which its minimum crosses the value @xmath25 , while @xmath51 produces a regular branch , as shown in the left diagram of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "reasoning similarly , in the case corresponding to figure [ fig3](c ) @xmath51 also has a minimum in a neighborhood of @xmath52 which crosses the value @xmath25 for a certain @xmath53 , since , as in section [ section3 ] , it blows to @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , it produces another turning point for @xmath53 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the right pictures in figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "when does not hold , which is the case , for example , of figure [ fig3](b ) , a deeper analysis than in the previous proof is required , since the zero of the derivative of @xmath56 is not simple and it could perturb , as @xmath27 , in more than one zero of @xmath57 , @xmath58 . in",

    ", we can apply the analysis of the previous sections to problem and , going back to the original problem , we obtain the same imperfect bifurcations of figure [ fig6 ] if we represent on the vertical axis @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 .",
