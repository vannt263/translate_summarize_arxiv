    "<S> the character of dynamical evolution can become independent of the microscopic details . for a closed system </S>",

    "<S> @xmath14 , we invoke a counter - superflow instability  @xcite by choosing oppositely directed flow vectors for the two field components . above a critical relative velocity , momentum exchange between the two fluids causes the superflow to decay and spin domains to form . </S>",

    "<S> the further dynamical evolution of overpopulated states involves particle transport towards small momenta and energy transport towards high momenta  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two ] this is best observed by comparing the high momentum tails of the momentum distributions at @xmath12 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> particle transport towards low momenta eventually fills the zero - mode ( not seen ) , a process most important in the miscible regime @xmath19 . the key insight gained from the spectra concerns the development of infrared ( ir ) power laws in the momentum distribution @xmath20 at @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> these power laws depend on the external parameter @xmath7 : @xmath22 for @xmath13 , @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 . also , the pattern of imbalance fluctuations in the system depends on the interaction strength .    </S>",
    "<S> we highlight the most striking observations at late times before we carry on developing a detailed understanding of the relation between the dominant fluctuations and the observed power laws . in the immiscible regime </S>",
    "<S> the system consists of few large domains with additional inclusions of small point - like domains . </S>",
    "<S> as compared to the initial time domains have considerably grown . </S>",
    "<S> a special situation is encountered at the transition point ( @xmath24 ) , where domain - like structures persist to extremely long times . </S>",
    "<S> this is remarkable since in this regime domains are not energetically favourable as compared to overlapping particle densities . for @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> imbalance fluctuations have decayed up to few small areas of strong imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> let us finally look at the largest computed time @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath13 , two domains of equal size remain , which reflects the immiscibility in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the small - scale domain - fluctuations have considerably reduced in number . at the transition point , we observe the persistence of domain - like structures which we attribute to a diverging time scale @xmath28 of domain decay as @xmath29 from below  @xcite . for @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> small long - lived imbalance fluctuations remain , whereas the background tends to become very smooth , @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the microscopic origin of the scaling found in the momentum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the bimodal power laws in these distributions are signatures of the system having approached a non - thermal fixed point  @xcite . at long times </S>",
    "<S> they become more pronounced in all three cases , signalling critical slowing down of the dynamic evolution . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three ] , the result of a decomposition of the momentum distribution according to spin and fluid degrees of freedom at @xmath31 is presented  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show spin - spin correlation functions as well as correlations in the incompressible velocity as a function of momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point is that they explain the scaling properties of the total momentum distribution and allow for an interpretation in terms of specific defect configurations , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two ] . </S>",
    "<S> this completes our understanding of transient non - equilibrium order in a two - component ultracold bose gas .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that , for all @xmath7 , compressible and quantum pressure excitations , which are not shown , dominate the spectrum in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regime and follow a thermal rayleigh - jeans distribution @xmath32 , while they give a negligible contribution towards lower momenta .    in the immiscible regime , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three ] ( left ) , the main contribution to the spectrum in the ir region is provided by the incompressible component @xmath33 , corresponding to flow orientations transverse to the direction in which the flow velocity varies . </S>",
    "<S> although we are dealing with a multi - component gas this feature is similar to superfluid turbulent flow in a single - component bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the incompressible spectrum shows @xmath34 scaling over approximately one decade which is generated by coherent vortical flows @xmath35 around topological defects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cores of these vortex - like structures can be seen in the spin imbalance , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two ] , since they are filled with particles of the other species and thus are of the skyrmion type . </S>",
    "<S> they are created during the merging process of domains and , persisting due to their topological nature , give the main contribution to the incompressible component spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , spin excitations @xmath36 overtake in an intermediate momentum region , showing a scaling of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> looking more closely , one observes that the scaling behaviour terminates in the ir at a scale @xmath38 given by the mean domain size @xmath39 , while the cut - off in the uv at @xmath40 is set by the width of the domain walls , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the spin healing length @xmath41 . since the two contributions @xmath36 and @xmath33 are of comparable magnitude within an intermediate momentum range the sum of all contributions , giving the full spectrum @xmath11 , appears to follow the power law @xmath42 in the ir , as discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation on the other side of the transition can also be clarified . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 falls below @xmath43 domains are energetically suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , vortices dominate the non - thermal fixed point and induce the characteristic scaling @xmath44 , see fig .  [ fig : three ] ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , it is also visible in the scaling of relative phase fluctuations @xmath45 , which is related to constant particle densities on scales larger than @xmath46 as compared to the skyrmionic case above .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture changes dramatically on the transition point , @xmath24 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three ] ( middle ) , vortical flow is much less important in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum distribution is dominated by spin fluctuations scaling as @xmath47  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this feature to the increased dimensionality of the vacuum manifold for @xmath24 which removes the topological protection of vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of domain walls at the transition point takes over but is non - topological in nature . instead </S>",
    "<S> , conservation laws restrict the decay of this particular type of defect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this argument can be made even more transparent by studying the critical dynamics at the transition from @xmath26 towards @xmath24 , where two non - equilibrium ordered states meet each other , vortices and domains  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is possible to establish the notion of a dynamical phase transition between different far - from - equilibrium ordered states in a two - component bose gas . beyond that , the underlying concept of topological defects determining bulk features of correlation functions in far - from - equilibrium situations is very general . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily imaginable that multi - component field theories with more than two components show similar behavior to the one outlined here . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the possibility of a universal duality between decaying defects and inverse particle cascades . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the generation of ( quasi-)topological configurations far from thermal equilibrium and their slow decay , going together with an increase of coherence and defect separation  @xcite . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> an inverse particle cascade is generated , and the associated power - laws can be found from the scaling properties of the respective single defect . a variety of ( quasi-)topological excitations are known to exist in multi - component fields  @xcite , examples are monopoles in gauge fields  @xcite and exotic magnets  @xcite , as well as skyrmions in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite and liquid crystals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> new interesting features that are readily accessible in experiment are expected for ultracold spinor gases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between different types of transient non - equilibrium order can be controlled by changing the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian and thus topology and local conservation laws of the system . </S>",
