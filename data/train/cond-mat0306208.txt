    "josephson - qubit devices  @xcite are based on the charge and phase degrees of freedom .",
    "the charge qubit is achieved in a cooper - pair box  @xcite , where two dominant charge states are coupled through coherent cooper - pair tunneling  @xcite . using cooper - pair tunneling in josephson charge devices  @xcite and via spectroscopic measurements for the josephson phase device  @xcite , it has been possible to experimentally observe energy - level splitting and related properties for state superpositions . in addition , using josephson charge devices prepared in a superposition of two charge states  @xcite ,",
    "coherent oscillations were observed .",
    "while operating at the degeneracy point , the charge - qubit states are highly coherent  @xcite ( @xmath0 ) , with a decoherence time of @xmath1  ns . these important experimental results indicate that the josephson charge and phase devices are potentially useful for solid - state qubits in quantum information processing .",
    "important open problems would now include implementing a _ two - bit coupling _ and then _ scaling up _ the architecture to many qubits . here , we propose a new quantum - computing ( qc ) scheme based on scalable charge - qubit structures .",
    "we focus on the josephson charge qubit realized in a cooper - pair box .",
    "the coulomb interaction between charges on different islands of the charge qubits would seem to provide a natural way of coupling josephson charge qubits ( e.g. , to connect two cooper - pair boxes via a capacitor ) . using this type of capacitive interbit coupling ,",
    "a two - bit operation  @xcite similar to the controlled - not gate was derived . however , as pointed out in @xcite , it is difficult in this scheme to switch on and off the coupling . also , it is hard to make the system scalable because only neighboring qubits can interact .",
    "moreover , implementations of quantum algorithms such as the deutsch and bernstein - vazirani algorithms were studied using a system of josephson charge qubits @xcite , where it was proposed that the nearest - neighbor charge qubits would be coupled by tunable dc squids . in the semiconductor literature",
    ", scalability often refers to reducing the size of the device ( packing more components ) . in qc",
    ", scalability refers to increasing the number of qubits coupled with each other .",
    "a suggestion for a scalable coupling of josephson charge qubits was proposed  @xcite using oscillator modes in a @xmath2 circuit formed by an inductance and the qubit capacitors . in this proposal ,",
    "the interbit coupling can be switched and any two charge qubits could be coupled .",
    "nevertheless , there is no efficient ( that is , using one two - bit operation ) qc scheme for this proposal  @xcite in order to achieve conditional gates  e.g . , the controlled - phase - shift and controlled - not gates .",
    "in addition , the calculated interbit coupling terms  @xcite only apply to the case when the following two conditions are met :    ( i )  the quantum manipulation frequencies , which are fixed experimentally , are required to be much smaller than the eigenfrequency @xmath3 of the @xmath2 circuit .",
    "this condition _ limits _ the allowed number @xmath4 of the qubits in the circuit because @xmath3 scales with @xmath5 . in other words , the circuits in @xcite are not really scalable .",
    "( ii )  the phase conjugate to the total charge on the qubit capacitors fluctuates weakly .",
    "the limitations listed above do not apply to our approach . in our scheme , a common inductance , but no @xmath2 circuit , is used to couple all josephson charge qubits . in our proposal , both dc and",
    "ac supercurrents can flow through the inductance , while in  @xcite only ac supercurrents can flow through the inductance and it is the @xmath2-oscillator mode that couples the charge qubits .",
    "these yield different interbit couplings ( e.g. , @xmath6 type  @xcite as opposed to @xmath7 in our proposal ) .",
    "we employ two dc squids to connect each cooper - pair box in order to achieve a _",
    "controllable interbit coupling_. our proposed qc architecture is scalable in the sense that _ any _ two charge qubits ( _ not _ necessarily neighbors ) can be effectively coupled by an experimentally accessible inductance .",
    "we also formulate @xcite an efficient qc scheme that requires only one ( instead of two or more ) two - bit operation to implement conditional gates . + this erice summer - school presentation is based on our work in @xcite . additional work on decoherence and noise - related issues appears in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "also , work more focused on entanglement and readout issues appears in @xcite .",
    "other interesting studies on charge qubits can be found in @xcite for the adiabatic controlled - not gate , in @xcite for geometric phases , and in @xcite for the dynamics of a josephson charge qubit coupled to a quantum resonator .",
    "figure 1 shows a proposed qc circuit consisting of @xmath4 cooper - pair boxes coupled by a common superconducting inductance @xmath8 . for the @xmath9th cooper - pair box , a superconducting island with charge @xmath10",
    "is weakly coupled by two symmetric dc squids and biased , through a gate capacitance @xmath11 , by an applied voltage @xmath12 .",
    "the two symmetric dc squids are assumed to be equal and all josephson junctions in them have josephson coupling energy @xmath13 and capacitance @xmath14 .",
    "the effective coupling energy is given by the squids , each one enclosing a magnetic flux @xmath15 .",
    "each squid provides a tunable coupling @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the flux quantum . the effective phase drop @xmath19 , with subscript @xmath20 labelling the squid above ( below ) the island",
    ", equals the average value , @xmath21/2 $ ] , of the phase drops across the two josephson junctions in the dc squid , where the superscript @xmath8 ( @xmath22 ) denotes the left ( right ) josephson junction . above",
    "we have neglected the self - inductance effects of each squid loop because the size of the loop is usually very small ( @xmath23 @xmath24 m ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system then becomes @xmath25 with @xmath26 given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the charging energy of the superconducting island and @xmath29 is the total persistent current through the superconducting inductance , as contributed by all coupled cooper - pair boxes .",
    "the offset charge @xmath30 is induced by the gate voltage @xmath12 .",
    "the phase drops @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related to the total flux @xmath33 through the inductance @xmath8 by the constraint @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the externally applied magnetic flux threading the inductance @xmath8 . in order to obtain a simpler expression for the interbit coupling , and without loss of generality ,",
    "the magnetic fluxes through the two squid loops of each cooper - pair box are designed to have the _ same _ values but _ opposite _ directions .",
    "if this were not to be the case , the interbit coupling can still be realized , but the hamiltonian of the qubit circuits would just take a more complicated form . because this pair of fluxes cancel each other in any loop enclosing them , then @xmath36 this imposes the constraint @xmath37 for the average phase drops across the josephson junctions in the squids .",
    "the common superconducting inductance @xmath8 provides the coupling among cooper - pair boxes .",
    "the coupling of selected cooper - pair boxes can be implemented by switching  on \" the squids connected to the chosen cooper - pair boxes . in this case , the persistent currents through the inductance @xmath8 have contributions from all the coupled cooper - pair boxes .",
    "the essential features of our proposal can be best understood via the very simplified diagram shown in fig .  2 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "3(a ) , for any given cooper - pair box , say @xmath38 , when @xmath39 for all boxes except @xmath40 , the inductance @xmath8 only connects the @xmath38th cooper - pair box to form a superconducting loop .",

    "retained up to second - order terms in the expansion parameter @xmath46 where @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 with @xmath49 the intrabit coupling @xmath44 in ( 9 ) is different from that in  @xcite because a very different contribution by @xmath8 is considered .      to couple",
    "_ any _ two cooper - pair boxes , say @xmath38 and @xmath50 , we choose @xmath51 for all boxes except @xmath40 and @xmath50 . as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the inductance @xmath8 is shared by the cooper - pair boxes @xmath38 and @xmath50 to form superconducting loops .",

    "specifically , the conditional gates such as the controlled - phase - shift and controlled - not gates can be obtained using one - bit rotations and only one basic two - bit operation . for details , see ref .",
    "a sequence of such conditional gates supplemented with one - bit rotations constitute a universal element for qc  @xcite .",
    "usually , a two - bit operation is much slower than a one - bit operation .",
    "our designs for conditional gates @xmath58 and @xmath59 are _ efficient _ since _ only one _ ( instead of two or more ) basic two - bit operation is used .",

    "when a dc squid magnetometer is inductively coupled to the inductance @xmath8 , these two supercurrents generate different fluxes through the squid loop of the magnetometer and the quantum - state information of the one - bit structure can be obtained from the measurements . in order to perform sensitive measurements with weak dephasing",
    ", one could use the underdamped dc squid magnetometer designed previously for the josephson phase qubit  @xcite .",
    "for the two - bit circuit described by eq .",
    "( 15 ) , the hamiltonian has four eigenstates and the supercurrents through inductance @xmath8 take different values for these four states .",
    "the fluxes produced by the supercurrents through @xmath8 can also be detected by the dc squid magnetometer .",
    "for example , when @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath40 and @xmath50 , the four eigenstates of the two - bit circuit are @xmath68 retained up to linear terms in @xmath65 and @xmath69 , the corresponding supercurrents through the inductance @xmath8 are @xmath70 for @xmath71 to 4 , where @xmath72 these supercurrents produce different fluxes threading the squid loop of the magnetometer and can be distinguished by dc squid measurements .",
    "when the two - bit system is prepared at the maximally entangled bell states @xmath73 these two states should be distinguishable by measuring the fluxes , generated by the supercurrents , through the squid loop of the magnetometer .",
    "the typical switching time @xmath74 during a one - bit operation is of the order of @xmath75 . using the experimental value @xmath76  mk , then @xmath77  ns .",
    "the switching time @xmath78 for the two - bit operation is typically of the order @xmath79 choosing @xmath76  mk and @xmath80 ( i.e. , ten times slower than the one - bit rotation ) , we have @xmath81 in our proposal . this number for @xmath8",
    "is experimentally realizable .",
    "a small - size inductance with this value can be made with josephson junctions .",
    "our expansion parameter @xmath82 is of the order @xmath83 our inductance @xmath8 is related with the inductance @xmath84 in  @xcite by @xmath85 let us now consider the case when @xmath80 .",
    "for the earlier design  @xcite , @xmath86 since @xmath87 , which requires an inductance @xmath88  @xmath24h .",
    "such a large inductance is problematic to fabricate at nanometer scales . in the improved design  @xcite , @xmath89 , greatly reducing the inductance to @xmath90 nh",
    "this inductance is about four times larger than the one used in our scheme , making it somewhat more difficult to realize than our proposed @xmath8 .",
