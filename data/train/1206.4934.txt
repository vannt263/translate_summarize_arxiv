    "modern cosmology is now able to constrain details about the era of reionization .",
    "observations show that the reionization of the universe occurred early and was extended in time , with an equivalent of an instantaneous reionization at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "stars are a likely candidate for being responsible for the majority of reionization because they are efficient producers of ultraviolet photons .",
    "thanks to a wave of modern , sensitive telescopes , we can begin to observe and understand the frontier of reionization , along with these high redshift stellar populations ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , we can observe these galaxies directly via high redshift surveys , which can now routinely identify a population of bright galaxies up to a redshift of about @xmath5 .",
    "however , these surveys can only locate those galaxies that are both above the limiting magnitude and common enough to be present in the survey field .",
    "it is now thought @xcite that reionization needed a large population of smaller galaxies below the current detection limits .",
    "because we can not yet observe these galaxies directly , we can instead look for their cumulative light , which should exist as background radiation . because reionization is said to have occurred around @xmath4",
    ", the photons responsible for reionization should be present in the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) .",
    "the spectral peak of this radiation is around the lyman@xmath6 line , which will be redshifted to @xmath7 microns .",
    "however , continuum emission will create an extended tail at longer wavelengths .    here",
    ", we discuss the cib from about 1 to 200 microns",
    ". the majority of the cib will be emission from sources below @xmath8 , such as our galaxy , foreground galaxies , and other sources of infrared light , such as zodiacal light .",
    "if these sources can be subtracted away to a high precision , it is possible that the remainder could be from the era of reionization , and if so , could tell us about the properties of these high redshift stars .",
    "there have been many attempts to theoretically model the high redshift component of the cib , especially in the near - infrared , from the mean @xcite , to fluctuations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we examine another way to analyze the cib , the fractional anisotropy , which is the ratio of the fluctuations to the mean . by looking at the fractional anisotropy ,",
    "many free parameters are removed and more information about this elusive stellar population can be extracted .",
    "specifically , we discuss using the cib as a probe for the escape fraction of ionizing photons . finding the escape fraction is important for understanding reionization and its duration .",
    "there have been several attempts to measure the escape fraction through analytical models , simulations , and observations ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "these papers have shown that the escape fraction appears to vary greatly from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "therefore , instead of trying to measure the escape fraction of an individual galaxy , here we discuss the average escape fraction of all galaxies , which will give more of a global view of reionization .",
    "in addition , the fractional anisotropy can reveal information about the dust content of galaxies , which is mostly unknown at high redshifts .",
    "we describe our simulations in section [ sec : sims ] and our models in section [ sec : models ] . in section [ sec : anis ] , we discuss our method for finding the mean cib , the fluctuations of the cib , and the fractional anisotropy . in section [ sec : results ] , we discuss our results of the fractional anisotropy for various bands . in section [ sec : obs ] , we discuss the most recent observations . we conclude in section [",
    "sec : conc ] . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the cosmological parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12)=(0.27 , 0.73 , 0.044 , 0.7 ) , consistent with the simulations from @xcite , which are based on the wmap 5-year results and other available constraints @xcite .",
    "in order to predict the angular power spectrum of the cib , we used simulations from @xcite , which are n - body simulations combined with radiative transfer , which allow us to see how sources are affected by the reionization process .",
    "the high resolution of these simulations ( with a minimum mass of @xmath13 ) allow us to also include jeans - mass filtering on low mass halos .",
    "this effectively allows suppression of star formation within small halos ( @xmath14 ) because of elevated gas temperatures that could be caused by the proximity to other star forming galaxies .",
    "these simulations have a box size of either @xmath15 ( for cases with suppression of small sources ) or @xmath16 ( with no suppression , where @xmath17 , or complete suppression , where @xmath18 ) .",
    "these simulations are summarized in table [ tab : sims ] @xcite .    to describe the stellar populations within these halos and their relationship with their environment",
    ", we define a parameter @xmath19 , which describes the number of ionizing photons produced per stellar atom that can escape the galaxy and reionize the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "@xmath19 is defined as a product of the star formation efficiency , or the fraction of baryons that are in stars ( @xmath20 ) , the escape fraction ( @xmath21 ) , and the number of ionizing photons per stellar atom ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 we allow @xmath19 to have different values , dependent on the mass of the halo , assuring it is consistent with reionization .    [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in figure [ fig : frac3 ] , we see the the fractional anisotropy for the case when galaxies contain dust . here , we no longer see a decrease in @xmath1 at long wavelengths .",
    "this is because dust will reprocess the stellar and nebular emission , re - emitting the light at longer wavelengths .",
    "( an illustration of the sed with dust included is also shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] . ) unlike nebular emission , the dust component will not fall to zero when @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the change between the dust emission from @xmath25 and @xmath24 is only slight . therefore , while the nebular component will disappear if @xmath24 , the dust component will still be present , causing the angular power spectrum at long wavelengths to remain high , raising @xmath1 .",
    "this is a direct result from the fact that nebular emission only results from ionizing photons , while photons of lower energies can be converted into dust emission .",
    "measurements of the cib are notoriously hard to perform .",
    "finding an accurate mean is particularly difficult because precise foreground subtraction is needed .",
    "however , observations , such as with ciber , akari , and herschel , continue to improve , resolving foregrounds in more detail and obtaining more reliable observations for the cib .",
    "many observations have been made to try to understand the contribution of high redshifts to the cib from 1 - 4 microns . in order to uncover any residual emission in the mean or fluctuation observations",
    ", one must carefully take into account all of the foreground components .",
    "zodiacal light is a major contaminant , and because it is very difficult to model , it is not straightforward to subtract from the cib .",
    "in addition , foreground galaxies at lower redshifts must be taken into account . despite the difficulty",
    ", there have been many attempts to measure the mean level of the cib in the near - infrared due to high redshift stars @xcite .",
    "fluctuation observations are , in theory , easier to perform , since they do not need an accurate zero point , and instead rely on variations from one region of the sky to another .",
    "however , these observations still rely on careful and complete subtraction of foreground sources , and also remain controversial @xcite .",
    "observations are even more difficult in the mid and far - infrared .",
    "one problem is that foregrounds that were present in the near - infrared are even more prevalent in the mid and far - infrared .",
    "zodiacal light peaks at about 20 @xmath26 , which washes out most detections of the cib in this range .",
    "in addition , galactic cirrus is a main contaminant , however , observations are possible in clean regions of the sky .",
    "finally , as wavelength increases , foreground galaxies become more difficult to resolve .",
    "all of these problems lead to only a fraction of the cib in the mid and far - infrared being resolved into low - redshift galaxies .",
    "it is likely that only a very small ( and currently unknown ) percentage of this excess is from @xmath0 , so care must be taken in interpreting observations .",
    "there has been a great push to understand the cib at longer wavelengths . at 100 and 160 @xmath26 , @xcite measured the mean and fluctuation power of galaxies at all redshifts using observations from iris / iras and spitzer / mips , respectively .",
    "fluctuations of the cumulative cib have been taken in the mid - infrared to submillimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the cumulative mean level of the cib from galaxies at all redshifts has been measured as well @xcite .",
    "the mean cib has been measured as a function of redshift @xcite , while measurements from blast and _ planck _ from 250 to 1400 microns @xcite could indicate that galaxies at a higher redshift ( here , @xmath27 ) could contribute more to the cib as the wavelength increases .",
    "currently , the best measurements @xcite show that the fractional anisotropy is at the order of 15% , however , these measurements include galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "one way to subtract unresolved low redshift galaxies in the mid to far - infrared to a more complete level is to use a stacking algorithm .",
    "this typically involves using the locations of known galaxies at a shorter wavelength , stacking these locations of a longer wavelength image , and utilizing this stack to calculate the cib accounted from these galaxies . if stacking is relied upon , more of the cib at long wavelengths can be resolved into lower redshift galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite used stacking to resolve 100% of the cib as detected with firas @xcite at 250 , 350 , and 500 microns using blast .",
    "@xcite used 24 @xmath26 sources from spitzer / mips data to stack images at 70 and 160 @xmath26 .",
    "they were able to resolve 79% , 92 % , and 69% of the cib at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath26 respectively .",
    "@xcite resolved 45% and 52% ( without stacking ) and 50% and 75% ( with stacking ) of the cib at 100 and 160 @xmath26 using herschel / pacs data . at longer wavelengths , @xcite resolved 16.5% of the cib at 870 microns using stacking . while it is possible that some of the remaining flux is from low redshift galaxies , it is also possible that some of this unresolved cib could be due to high redshift galaxies .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we compare some of these observations to our models for the fractional anisotropy at high redshifts .",
    "while precise measurements of the mean are challenging , measurements of the fluctuation power are becoming more reliable .",
    "because of this , in figure [ fig : obs ] we show the fractional anisotropy predicted using various recent observations of the fluctuation power , assuming an upper limit of the mean cib due to high redshift stars is either @xmath28 nw m@xmath29 sr@xmath30 or @xmath31 nw m@xmath29 sr@xmath30 . because it is unlikely that a @xmath32 component of the mean cib will be much higher than this , very low values of @xmath1 , and thus very high values of the escape fraction from a dust - free population ,",
    "can be ruled out .",
    "more definitive conclusions can be reached as observations continue to improve and our understanding of foreground emission grows .",
    "it is important to remember that there is still low - redshift contamination contributing to both the mean and fluctuations , especially at longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , these results should be interpreted with this in mind . as observations improve",
    ", these results will become more reliable .",
    "we have shown the observable signatures of high redshift populations with different values of the escape fraction @xmath21 and dust content in the cib .",
    "it is possible to distinguish these populations through observations of the fractional anisotropy of the cib .",
    "the global escape fraction of high redshift galaxies is a main variable that can be probed in this way , since the angular power spectrum is dependent on it , while the mean is not .",
    "in addition , dust will transform the sed of the galaxy , thus leaving an imprint on the fractional anisotropy .",
    "therefore , low values of the fractional anisotropy will be indicative of a population of stars with a high escape fraction and little dust",
    ". this will be more noticeable at longer wavelengths . while observations are still difficult , improved observations could be able to distinguish between these populations .",
