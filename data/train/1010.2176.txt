    "bounding @xmath390 and denoting @xmath391 , the fact that @xmath184 and @xmath185 are constants implies @xmath392 since @xmath393 plugging in @xmath283 gives the first approximation given in equation and the second follows directly from stirling s formula .",
    "the terms with @xmath246 contribute to the error by the above argument combined with the fact that the maximal value @xmath394 is asymptotically smaller in this case .    although one could obtain a bound in general for the terms coming from the non - holomorphic part of the poincar series , we choose not to do so here because these terms will not play a role the asymptotic of the coefficients of the faber polynomials .",
    "this occurs because we will only need the above bound when taking linear combinations of harmonic weak maass forms which are weakly holomorphic modular forms .",
    "since such forms are holomorphic in the upper half plane , their non - holomorphic parts must necessarily cancel and hence can not contribute to the asymptotics for the coefficients of the faber polynomials .",
    "we have now set up the necessary tools to prove theorem [ thm : coeffvary ] .",
    "we begin by combining and to obtain @xmath395 since the order of vanishing at @xmath108 on the left hand side is precisely @xmath237 ( resp .",
    "@xmath100 ) whenever @xmath128 ( resp .",
    "@xmath109 ) , we take the derivative of both sides @xmath237 ( resp .",
    "@xmath100 ) times and then evaluate at @xmath108 .",
    "we only write down the @xmath128 case here .",
    "since the left hand side is holomorphic in the upper half plane , the right hand side must be as well .",
    "we therefore will only need asymptotics for @xmath396 for some choices of @xmath397 , @xmath398 , and @xmath399 . since the main term in theorem [ thm : growth ] came from the holomorphic part",
    ", one has the same asymptotic growth for @xmath400 as for @xmath401 . since we must take the derivative of each of the @xmath402 occurring on the left hand side exactly once and we may take the derivatives in any order , the derivative of the left hand side equals @xmath403 we will show that the @xmath237-th derivative of the right hand side of is asymptotically equal to @xmath85 and then the theorem will follow directly from theorem [ thm : growth ] .",
    "we first consider the terms @xmath404 .",
    "choose an orthonormal basis @xmath405 .",
    "we may write @xmath406 for some choice of @xmath407 , and the work of bringmann and ono @xcite shows that @xmath408 is a lift for @xmath409 ( that is , @xmath410 ) .",
    "since @xmath411 are orthogonal , it follows that the @xmath412 are independent , and hence give another basis for the space of harmonic weak maass forms with principal part at most @xmath413 .",
    "therefore @xmath414 for some constants @xmath415 .",
    "say that @xmath416 . then by integrating @xmath169 against itself , one obtains @xmath417 and @xmath418 since @xmath419 acts trivially on the right hand side so that it must be a weakly holomorphic modular form , while @xmath122 is the unique weakly holomorphic modular form with principal part @xmath420 .",
    "since the bound given in proposition [ prop : mfixedgrowth ] is independent of @xmath31 for @xmath31 fixed , we obtain the same asymptotic bound for @xmath421 , so that @xmath422 by , these terms will contribute to the error as long as @xmath423 grows only polynomially as a function of @xmath32 . since the @xmath32-th fourier coefficient of @xmath169 equals @xmath424 we can use the expansion @xmath425 for the @xmath32-th coefficient . due to a bound of weil @xcite",

    "@xmath427 , the @xmath428-bessel function decays as a function of @xmath32 , while for @xmath429 the @xmath428-bessel function grows like @xmath430 , so that we obtain polynomial growth in terms of @xmath32 in both cases .",
    "it follows that @xmath431    we now consider the terms coming from the faber polynomial with @xmath432 .",
    "when @xmath61 is bounded as a function of @xmath32 we are done , since in that case these terms are bounded by @xmath433 we hence assume that @xmath434 .",
    "the @xmath237-th derivative of @xmath435 equals zero at @xmath108 whenever @xmath436 , since we can not take a derivative of each @xmath402 and @xmath160 .",
    "it remains to bound the terms with @xmath437 . in this case , we keep track of how many times we take the derivative of each term @xmath438 ( for some constant @xmath311 ) and how many times we take the derivative of @xmath57 when using the product rule repeatedly . the derivatives of the @xmath57 can easily be shown to satisfy the same bounds ( actually , better bounds ) as those given in of proposition [ prop : mfixedgrowth ] by writing the fourier expansion for the eisenstein series , so , for cosmetic reasons and for clarity of proof , we will treat them universally with the same bound .",
    "assume that we are taking @xmath439 derivatives of the first term , @xmath440 derivatives of the second term , and so forth .",
    "after reordering to force @xmath441 with @xmath442 , the number of times we take this many derivatives is counted by the multinomial coefficient @xmath443 thus , using to bound the derivatives ( note that for @xmath61 bounded the asymptotic is also clearly true ) , we have the bound @xmath444 we now use sterling s formula to bound the ratio @xmath445 and the fact that @xmath446 to bound the inner sum of universally , giving the bound of from above by @xmath447 the inner sum now counts the number of partitions of @xmath237 into precisely @xmath448 parts .",
    "we naively bound this by the hardy and ramanujan asymptotic @xmath449 for the partition function .",
    "since the @xmath61 bounded case has already been completed , we may use induction to plug in the asymptotic for @xmath450 .",
    "since @xmath451 , which is easily verified by bounding @xmath452 and @xmath453 , and @xmath454 we may bound by @xmath455 for @xmath61 sufficiently large , the factor @xmath456 goes to zero , and the theorem follows .",
