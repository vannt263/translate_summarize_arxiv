    "mid - infrared ( mir ) observations probe the dusty interstellar medium and the dust - enshrouded star formation in galaxies . the spectral energy distribution in this region is shaped by this star formation , but can also be affected by the presence ( or lack ) of dust grains of varying size , by differences in metallicity , and by radiation from an older population of stars @xcite .",
    "one of the first studies of the mir spectra of a large sample of galaxies including the low metallicity system ii zw 40 was performed by @xcite .",
    "more recent observations have been used to understand how these different properties affect a galaxy s spectral energy distribution . with the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the _ infrared space observatory _ , the facilities are now available to make deep observations in the mir .",

    "i zw 18 and sbs 0335 - 052 , no pah emission is detected even in deep observations @xcite .",
    "several models for the decrease in pah emission with metallicity have been proposed including destruction of pah molecules by the hard radiation field in low metallicity systems because the dust opacity is low in these environments @xcite , destruction in the shocks created by supernova blast waves @xcite , and an intrinsic lack of pah molecules in young systems because the pahs are produced in low - mass stars that have not yet evolved @xcite .    using the measured mir properties of galaxies to determine their star formation rates",
    "requires an understanding of the properties that affect the heating of the dust responsible for the mir emission . at high redshift ,",
    "in particular , the effect of metallicity on the mir emission may become more significant if a larger fraction of the galaxy population consists of low metallicity systems .",
    "the relationships between mir flux density and sfr may not be the same as those for the more luminous and metal - rich systems for which the relationships were determined ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "emission from very small grains and warmer dust is seen in low metallicity galaxies but much less emission from pah molecules is detected relative to spiral and higher luminosity starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example , in the small magellanic cloud where the metallicity is low , the dust properties , absorption , and emissivity are significantly different from what is seen in the milky way , indicating that metal - rich galaxies are not a proxy for their lower - metallicity counterparts @xcite .",

    "the data are presented in  2 . a detailed look at flux density ratios and the mir seds of these galaxies",
    "are examined in  3 to answer the question , as best as the data will allow , do these galaxies exhibit pah emission ?",
    "the measured sfrs determined from the optical , mir , and ultraviolet ( uv ) data are discussed and compared in  4 , and the results are summarized in  5 .",
    "the galaxies in this study are low luminosity star - forming galaxies selected from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) in the botes field .",
    "these systems have been observed both as a part of the kiss survey and by several other surveys at optical , infrared , and ultraviolet wavelengths including the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs , @xcite ) , the _",
    "spitzer_/irac shallow survey @xcite , and a shallow _ spitzer_/mips survey .",
    "@xcite provides a discussion of the _ spitzer_/irac shallow survey data for these objects .",
    "kiss is a modern objective - prism survey .",
    "it combines the methodology of many of the classic wide - field color- and line - selected surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the higher sensitivity of a ccd detector .",
    "the survey method is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "kiss selects objects for inclusion in the survey lists if they possess a strong ( @xmath0 5@xmath1 ) emission line in their low - dispersion objective - prism spectra .",
    "the survey has been carried out in two distinct spectral regions : the blue portion ( 4800  5500",
    " ) where the primary line observed is [ ] @xmath25007 , and the red region ( 6400  7200  ) where galaxies are selected by their h@xmath3 emission .",
    "the current sample of galaxies were chosen from the @xcite list of h@xmath3 emission - line galaxy ( elg ) candidates ( hereafter kr3 ) .",
    "the objective prism passband imposes a redshift limit on the sample of @xmath4 .",
    "the selection criteria used to define the sample were that the galaxies exhibit spectra consistent with heating by star - formation processes ( i.e. , agns were excluded ) and that they have a b - band absolute magnitude m@xmath518.0 ( for h@xmath6 = 75 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , although four are slightly brighter than this limit when they are corrected for extinction ) .",
    "thus these galaxies are selected to be star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "these criteria produced a list of 26 galaxies within the ndwfs botes area .",
    "however , of those 26 galaxies , only 19 overlap with the _ spitzer _ shallow survey area because the _ spitzer _ survey field is smaller than the ndwfs field . we discuss only these 19 galaxies in our analysis .",

    "all of the kiss elg candidates in the botes field possess higher dispersion follow - up slit spectra @xcite that have been used to verify the reality of the putative emission lines seen in the objective - prism spectra , calculate accurate redshifts , and to distinguish between the various activity types that might be present in a line - selected sample ( e.g. , star - forming galaxies vs.  agns ) .",
    "these follow - up spectra provide us with a great deal of useful information ( e.g. , accurate redshifts , emission - line fluxes and line ratios , reddening and metallicity estimates ) .",

    "the regions around the galaxies were first masked to exclude the flux from neighboring sources .",
    "most of the galaxies were then fit with circular apertures ( for the 3 distinctly elliptical galaxies , kissr 2302 , 2357 , and 2359 , elliptical apertures were used to minimize the noise ) . in order to calculate the total uv counts for the galaxy , the size of the apertures was allowed to grow until the background was reached as determined by the curve of growth of the flux .",

    "the results are presented in table 2 .",
    "the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission from dwarf and low metallicity galaxies has been discussed by several different groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this subject is of increasing interest because these molecules provide a probe of the star - formation environment and , therefore , can be used as a measure of the star - formation rate in galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the [ 3.6]-[8.0 ] colors of these galaxies span the full range of late - type galaxy colors .",
    "the presence of some star - forming dwarfs with very red infrared colors indicates that even some metal poor dwarf galaxies which have low line - of - sight internal reddening , as measured by the c@xmath22 parameter , have a significant amount of dust .",
    "nevertheless , the only way to definitively determine whether a galaxy exhibits pah emission is through infrared spectroscopy , but only a small number of sources are bright enough to be measured in this way .    to assess the degree to which pah emission is present in the galaxies in this sample , information from broadband flux ratios was combined with an examination of the galaxies spectral energy distributions ( seds ; description of the sed fitting procedures is presented in appendix a ) .",
    "the fitting process provides a comparison of the rough shape of the sed measured from the broadband data with a set of galaxy templates .",
    "the relevant pieces of information are given in table [ tab : sed ] .",
    "the general trends in the data are presented here while a detailed description of the results for each galaxy in the sample are included in appendix b. the template fitting approach used here is not ideal because it does not provide a physical measurement of the stars , dust , and pahs and because the templates are not derived from low metallicity galaxies . as has been shown by @xcite and @xcite , a proper analysis of the dust ,",
    "pah emission and stellar starburst component is not possible using only the irac and mips photometric points even in ",
    "simple \" star forming galaxies because of the degeneracy in these component s contributions to the near-/mid - ir spectrum of the galaxy . as a result , these templates provide only a general guide to the properties of the galaxies and are used to answer two basic questions : ( 1 ) are the seds of dwarf starbursts similar to those of  normal \" and starburst galaxies ? and ( 2 ) do dwarf starbursts have  detectable \" pah emission ?    figures [ fig : seds ] to [ fig : vsg_diag ] provide diagnostics of the pah and dust emission properties of galaxies .",
    "the model template fits to the galaxy spectral energy distributions ( which were not fit at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath11 m points where pah emission has the largest impact ) are shown in figures [ fig : seds ] , [ fig : seds2 ] , and [ fig : seds3 ] .",
    "the galaxies that have significant pah emission ( figure [ fig : seds ] ) either exceed the models at 8 @xmath11 m or have 8@xmath11 m fluxes that are within 3@xmath1 of the models .",
    "alternatively , all of the galaxies without pah emission either have large reduced @xmath23 for the template fits ( the lowest @xmath24 ) or the templates exceed the data by at least 3@xmath1 at 8@xmath11 m .",
    "all of the other galaxies fall between these two criteria and are listed as having questionable pah emission which probably means that they have a low level of pah emission .",
    "however , a definitive and/or quantitative assessment of the pah emission from this intermediate category can not be made without spectroscopy .",
    "note that there are also three galaxies for which seds are not plotted because the long wavelength data necessary to constrain the fits do not exist .",
    "figure  [ fig:8mratio ] shows the relationship between the quality of the fit to the sed template and the 8@xmath11 m to 8@xmath11 m continuum ratio . the fit is worse for large values of log@xmath25 .",
    "the ratio of 8 @xmath11 m emission to the 8@xmath11 m continuum provides an alternate method for determining the existence of pah emission .",
    "those galaxies that have detectable pah emission have a flux ratio that is larger than one .",
    "this method of separating the galaxies is in agreement with the examination of the seds and would place kissr 2359 in the pah detections category and kissr 2309 in the non - detections category .",
    "figure  [ fig : engplt1 ] shows the relationship between ratios of the 8  @xmath11 m emission and the dust continuum at shorter and longer wavelengths .",
    "the division of galaxies into systems exhibiting pah emission and those that do not based on the relationship between the 8@xmath11 m fluxes and the models as discussed above agree well with the divisions established by @xcite based on the relationship between the 8  @xmath11 m emission and the dust continuum .",
    "the 8  @xmath11 m excess above the dust continuum for galaxies with pah emission is reflected in the flux density ratio : f@xmath26(8.0)/f@xmath26(24)@xmath27 .",
    "the galaxies for which the seds do not definitively determine the nature of the pah emission populate both the  pah \" and  no - pah \" region of the plot .",
    "kissr 2292 , 2318 , and 2322 look like galaxies with pah emission using this measure while kissr 2309 looks like galaxies without pah emission and kissr 2359 is on the boundary between the two regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsg_diag ] shows how the ratio between the 8  @xmath11 m emission and the hot dust continuum is related to the slope of the hot dust continuum .",
    "the 8 @xmath11 m flux has been stellar subtracted assuming f@xmath26(8.0)@xmath28f@xmath26(3.6 ) ( @xcite , the correction at 8@xmath11 m is very small and the stellar contribution at 16 and 24 @xmath11 m is ignored because it is negligible . ) the blackbody that was fit to the galaxy seds in  3.1 is not used for this subtraction because the templates also include some stellar light so this extrapolation from the 3.6 @xmath11 m flux is more appropriate .",
    "in general the galaxies that do not exhibit pah emission have small values for both of these ratios : f@xmath26(8.0)/f@xmath26(24)@xmath29 and f@xmath26(8.0)/f@xmath26(16)@xmath30 while all of the galaxies that exhibit pah emission have f@xmath26(8.0)/f@xmath26(16)@xmath31 .",
    "the galaxies for which the sed fitting was not able to distinguish between pah and no - pah emission fall between these two groups in their f@xmath26(8.0)/f@xmath26(16 ) ratio and all fall below the starburst galaxy model curves .",
    "the pah and no - pah galaxies are better separated in this plot than they are with the other mir flux ratios . in particular the galaxies are well separated using the f@xmath26(8.0)/f@xmath26(16 ) ratio .    for a small number of these galaxies , 70 and 160",
    "@xmath11 m data exist and the models described in @xcite can be used to investigate a possible explanation for the differences between the seds of these galaxies and those of the templates .",
    "these models include pah material in addition to dust which consists of a mixture of carbonaceous and amorphous silicate grains that have sizes consistent with the observed wavelength - dependent extinction in the milky way while allowing the pah abundance and the radiation field to vary .",
    "while the smaller number of data points inserted into the model should caution against over - interpretation of the results , they do allow for a comparison of a few of our dwarfs with some more  normal \" galaxies .",
    "this comparison provides at least one explanation of the differences we see between our galaxies and the model templates .",
    "the parameters we derive from the model include q@xmath32 , the fractional contribution of pahs to the dust ; a parameterization of the heating of the dust by starlight in the intensity range between u@xmath33 and u@xmath34 given by : @xmath35 = ( 1-@xmath36)m@xmath37(u - u@xmath33 ) + @xmath36m@xmath38 @xmath39u@xmath40 ; and f@xmath41 , the fraction of the ir luminosity that is radiated in regions where u@xmath42 .",
    "we follow the prescription in @xcite for estimating these quantities for the galaxies possessing enough data . for the galaxies without 160 @xmath11 m detections we use the 3 @xmath1 value as an upper limit and obtain a lower limit by assuming that between 70 and 160 @xmath11 m the galaxy s sed is rayleigh - jeans which defines f@xmath43/f@xmath44 .    for kissr 2316 and 2344",
    "which both have pah emission , u@xmath45 , q@xmath463.2% and 1.8% , @xmath47 0.01 and 0.001 , and f@xmath48 7.6% and 3.8% respectively . for several other pah emitting galaxies with limits on the 160 @xmath11 m flux",
    "the range of f@xmath41 can be computed . for kissr 2406 ,",
    "f@xmath41 = 5.8 - 6.9% while for kissr 2382 and 2398 the fraction is below the plot / fit range .",
    "only a small fraction of the dust emission in galaxies that exhibit clear pah emission comes from high stellar intensity regions , according to these models .",
    "the @xcite dust diagnostics for kissr 2349 , which does not show pah emission , indicate that u@xmath49 , q@xmath461.12% , @xmath50 0.09 and f@xmath48 40% . for galaxies for which we only have 160 @xmath11 m limits ,",
    "kissr 2326 , 2338 , and 2368 , f@xmath4815 - 20% , 31 - 35% , and 30 - 34% respectively .",
    "the value of f@xmath41 derived for these dwarf galaxies is much higher than the values for the galaxies examined by @xcite .",
    "this difference in f@xmath41 may indicate that these galaxies are experiencing the destruction of pahs in the photo - dissociation regions .",
    "these galaxies which do not show pah emission have model parameters indicating a stronger radiation field and with more of the ir luminosity originating in high intensity regions where it is more difficult for the pahs to survive .",
    "why is the shape of high infrared luminosity templates of normal metallicity galaxies more consistent with the observed sed of these low luminosity low metallicity dwarf galaxies ( specifically kissr 2338 , 2349 , and 2368 ) ?",
    "one of the primary reasons that the high luminosity templates fit these objects better is that they peak at shorter wavelengths and , in general , have a steeper ( redder ) spectral slope in the 8 to 70 @xmath11 m range which is also observed in these dwarfs . in addition , the fits may be thrown off by minimal or absent pah emission since all of the templates include the pah features .",
    "this also explains why the fits to pah - deficient sources are poor .",
    "a more physical reason for the poor fits may be that for these compact galaxies the specific sfrs ( normalized ) by mass are high so , like in the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , more of the pahs are being destroyed in the high intensity radiation .",
    "in particular it may be that the area outside of the star - formation region , where most of the pah emission originates , is smaller in the galaxies that lack pah emission because the hii regions are beginning to overlap .",
    "metallicity is a parameter that can shape the properties of the interstellar medium in galaxies and can span a wide range both within and between galaxies .",
    "we explore how metallicity affects properties of the dust observable in the mid - infrared emission from these systems .    figure  [ fig : abundrat ] shows the variations in the ratio of the pah emission at 8.0 @xmath11 m to the dust continuum at 24 @xmath11 m with metallicity .",
    "both the galaxies from this sample and the blue compact dwarf galaxies @xcite show a weaker correlation ( correlation coefficient @xmath51 ) than the systems in the @xcite sample ( correlation coefficient @xmath52 ) .",
    "star - forming dwarf galaxies span a wide range in 8 to 24 @xmath11 m flux density ratio  over an order of magnitude at @xmath8 + 12 = 8.2 $ ] .",
    "the transition from a high flux density ratio to a low ratio at @xmath8 + 12=8.2 $ ] , as claimed by @xcite , appears to be more of a slow transition with a large galaxy - to - galaxy variation at metallicities around this transition value .",
    "several of the galaxies in the @xmath8 + 12=8.0 $ ] to 8.2 range exhibit pah emission and there is nearly two orders of magnitude spread in the 8 to 24  @xmath11 m flux density ratio in this metallicity range .",
    "figure  [ fig : abundrat2 ] shows the relationship between metallicity and 16 to 24  @xmath11 m flux density ratio for this survey and the 16 to 22  @xmath11 m flux density ratio for the blue compact dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this flux density ratio is a measure of the continuum slope in these galaxies .",
    "fluxes measured at 24 and 22  @xmath11",
    "m should be comparable because the bands are wide ( 5.5 and 7  @xmath11 m respectively ) , the spectrum is fairly smooth in this flux range , and the relative k - corrections should be small  for a standard dust sed , the 16 to 22  @xmath11 m flux density ratio would be slightly larger .",
    "there is an increase in the flux density ratio with increasing metallicity , but the spread at any given metallicity is large .",
    "for any given metallicity there is a wide range in the slope of the dust continuum , but on average the lower metallicity galaxies have a steeper slope . as mentioned previously , this steeper slope implies hotter dust which may be explained by higher radiation density and increased emission from very small grains in these dwarf galaxies .",
    "figures  [ fig : abundrat ] and [ fig : abundrat2 ] demonstrate that these galaxies exhibit a wide range of emission and/or dust properties at any given metallicity ",
    "there is a wide range in the pah to continuum ratio ( figure  [ fig : abundrat ] ) and in the continuum slope ( figure  [ fig : abundrat2 ] ) .",
    "star - formation rate plays an important role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "as the high redshift universe becomes more and more accessible , star - formation and its evolution can be studied over a wider range of epochs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of the evolution in the star - formation rate come from indicators that span the spectrum from the rest - frame uv ( e.g. , @xcite ) to the optical ( e.g. , @xcite ) to the infrared ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all of the sfr indicators commonly used make assumptions about the metallicity , stellar make - up , star - formation mode ( continuous versus instantaneous star formation ) and/or interstellar medium properties of the systems . in general the conversion from flux to star - formation rate assumes a standard imf in a solar metallicity galaxy with interstellar medium properties consistent with a ",
    "normal \" galaxy in the local universe . in order to use these indicators at higher",
    "redshift , where low metallicity star - forming galaxies may be more prevalent , the connection between flux and sfr must be evaluated for a range of metallicity and galaxy type . because it contains a large fraction of low metallicity systems , this sample can be used to compare the affect of galaxy metallicity on the sfrs calculated at different wavelengths .",

    "the answer to this question is critical if measurements of sfr from the mir and uv are going to be used along with hh@xmath3  to compute sfr density over a wide range of redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : mirsfr ] shows the relationship between the mir measurements of sfr and the metallicity - corrected hh@xmath3  sfr ( left - hand panel ) and between sfr measured over a wide range of wavelengths and the metallicity - corrected hh@xmath3  sfr ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "the errors due to the galaxy photometry on all of these these data points ( and those in the subsequent sfr plots ) , with the exception of the nuv values , are smaller than the points .",
    "the nuv sfrs are the exception because the values are all lower limits since no correction has been made for extinction .",
    "there is also a distance error associated with these measurements but they will only shift all of the points up or down without altering their relative separations ( i.e. , it will not change the spread between the points ) .",
    "these plots show that there is over an order of magnitude spread in the sfr measurement for a given galaxy and the disagreement occurs for both high and low sfr sources .",
    "however , the plot also shows that several of the methods give similar answers .",
    "the @xcite and the 24 @xmath11 m @xcite values are similar as are the 8 @xmath11 m @xcite and the @xcite values .",
    "these values agree because they were derived in a consistent way for normal galaxies and are derived from the same fluxes ( 24 @xmath11 m and 8 @xmath11 m respectively ) .",
    "the spread in the derived sfrs points to a systematic difference in the calculation of these values due either to the intrinsic spread in the luminosity - sfr relationships or to a physical difference between these galaxies and those for which the luminosity - sfr relationship was derived .    in general , the measurements based on the 24 @xmath11 m luminosity ( @xcite and 24 @xmath11",
    "m @xcite ) tend to indicate a higher sfr than the 8 @xmath11 m @xcite or 8 plus 24 @xmath11 m @xcite measurements .",
    "this result is consistent with the 8 @xmath11 m to hh@xmath3  correlation having a steeper slope for dwarf galaxies than it does for more luminous galaxies as was found in the @xcite study . for six galaxies in this sample",
    "the sfr derived from the 8 @xmath11 m flux is about an order of magnitude lower than that derived from the 24 @xmath11 m flux .",
    "all six of these galaxies are low metallicity systems ( z < @xmath630.25 z@xmath9 ) that have seds which show no evidence for pah emission .",
    "kissr 2359 which has low pah emission , has an 8 @xmath11 m derived sfr that is 4.5 times smaller than the 24 @xmath11 m sfr .",
    "clearly the 8 @xmath11 m emission is not a good sfr indicator for low metallicity objects that may not exhibit pah emission .",
    "alternatively , the 24 @xmath11 m sfr seems , in general , to overpredict the sfr in these galaxies relative to the hh@xmath3  measurement .",
    "the galaxies in this sample are , in general , very compact systems with hard radiation fields because they tend to also be low metallicity systems .",
    "these conditions appear to be driving the heating of hot dust and/or very small grains that dominate in the region between 8 and 24 @xmath11 m as has been seen previously in low metallicity systems @xcite .",
    "the difference between the 24  @xmath11 m and hh@xmath3  sfrs is certainly affected by the incorrect calibration of the 24  @xmath11 m sfr for these galaxies which comes about because the seds shown in  3.1 are not well fit by the low luminosity templates .",
    "the right - hand panel in figure [ fig : mirsfr ] shows the sfr computed using several different indicators including the @xcite mir indicator and the nuv emission .",
    "the sfrs computed in the nuv have not been corrected for extinction . for the highest sfr systems ( which are also the highest metallicity ones ) , the lack of an extinction correction has led to a low measurement of the sfr . however , for most of the systems , the sfr computed in the uv is larger than that computed from the hh@xmath3  despite the fact that extinction has not been taken into account .",
    "one factor in the high uv sfr may be that the there is a metallicity dependence that has not been accounted for .",
    "however , the significant excess in the uv sfr even for galaxies that have metallicities @xmath64z_@xmath58 , indicates that this is probably not the only factor . a higher sfr measured in the uv than in hh@xmath3 ,",
    "attributed to declining star - formation from a young but quasi - stellar burst , has also been seen for intergalactic star - forming regions in ngc 5291 @xcite .",
    "a declining sfr in the kiss galaxies would explain the discrepancy between the hh@xmath3  and uv sfrs since the timescale in the uv is about 10 times longer than it is in hh@xmath3 .",
    "however , this timescale argument would not explain why the uv sfr is higher than the mir sfr which does not decline as quickly .",
    "a different explanation would be that the interstellar medium has been blown out in these systems so that there is much less gas and dust surrounding the star - forming region .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the mid - infrared spectroscopic results for a similar sample of galaxies which provides evidence for supernova driven bubbles surrounding the star - formation regions @xcite .",
    "a much more detailed analysis would be required to assess whether there was a strong burst of star - formation in the recent past that could have blown away the gas and dust .",
    "the plot includes the combined mir and nuv sfr using the @xcite formulation . for two of the galaxies ,",
    "the total sfr is smaller than the @xcite mir sfr alone because there is a small difference in the calibration in the two methods .",

    "figure [ fig : sfrplot ] shows the mir sfr as a function of the hh@xmath3  sfr with point type specifying those galaxies with and without pah emission . for the galaxies that appear to have pah emission , the 8 and 24  @xmath11 m measurements of sfr are , in all but one case , in good agreement with the hh@xmath3  values . for galaxies that do not show evidence for pah emission , the sfr computed from the 8 @xmath11 m flux is lower than what is measured from the hh@xmath3  emission , while the value computed from the 24 @xmath11 m emission is higher in all but one case .",
    "the dispersion in the values of sfr computed in the mid - infrared for these galaxies appears to be driven by a difference in the properties of the interstellar medium in these galaxies .",

    "the rates calculated from hh@xmath3 , 8 @xmath11 m , 24 @xmath11 m , and the total infrared are fairly consistent for kissr 2316 and 2318 ( the uv values are low because they are not corrected for extinction )",
    ". however , the sfrs computed for kissr 2359 are more problematic .",
    "this source has the highest hh@xmath3  sfr , ( 3.59 m@xmath65 yr@xmath7 ; not correcting for metallicity because the source is close to z@xmath65 ) in the sample .",
    "the 24 @xmath11 m sfrs from the @xcite models and from the @xcite correlation are 1.87 and 1.40 respectively .",
    "these are smaller than the hh@xmath3  values , but given the spread in the models and correlation they are still consistent",
    ". however , the 8 @xmath11 m sfr from the @xcite correlation is only 0.31 , significantly less than what is measured from the other methods . the lower value for the 8 @xmath11 m emission may be a reflection of a substantial portion of the infrared emission coming from a high intensity region where the pahs are destroyed .",
    "star - forming dwarf galaxies have a wide range of dust properties that are quite different from those of the spiral and massive starburst galaxies .",
    "these differences most likely result from a combination of the harder radiation field , the more compact structure of these systems , possibly a lack of dust due to destruction in shocks or delayed injection , and either a different composition , different heating , or different distribution of the dust in the interstellar medium .",
    "we have used broadband seds and color - color diagrams to determine the presence or absence of pah emission in the sample galaxies .",
    "it appears that one of the best indicators of pah emission may be the 8 to 16@xmath11 m flux ratio .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy , which is not available at this time , is required to confirm these results .",
    "nevertheless , the combination of the seds and the color - color plots provide more information on the presence or absence of pah emission than the trend of color with metallicity that was evident from only the _",

    ".    one of the most striking properties of the galaxies in this sample is that , despite their simplicity in being compact systems dominated by a small number of regions , they have a wide range of infrared properties .",
    "there are low metallicity systems that show some evidence for pah emission ( kissr 2322 , z=0.24z_@xmath58 ) and high metallicity systems for which pah emission is uncertain ( kissr 2359 , z=0.91z_@xmath58 ) indicating that metallicity is not the only parameter driving the presence and/or strength of the pah emission features .",
    "it is not only the pah emission features in these star - forming dwarf galaxies that are different from the spirals and massive starbursts , but also the shapes of the mid - infrared continuua .",
    "many of these galaxies have steep , red mid - infrared continuua similar to those observed by @xcite in starburst galaxies , by @xcite in low metallicity galaxies and modeled by @xcite as being due to emission from very small grains .    applying the model of @xcite",
    "provides one possible interpretation of the differences between the seds of the dwarf galaxies and the model templates .",
    "the galaxies for which the mid - ir flux ratios indicate a lack of pah emission have a large fraction of their infrared emission coming from the photodissociation regions ( 15 - 40% ) relative to galaxies for which the mid - ir flux ratios indicate the presence of pah emission ( 2 - 8% ) .",
    "pahs are more likely to be destroyed in the high intensity photodissociation regions which would explain why the pah fraction is lower where these regions dominate",
    ". a physical model that might explain this circumstance would be that the regions are beginning to overlap thereby shrinking the relative volume of the lower intensity regions .    the effect of metallicity on the star - formation rate in galaxies is well studied @xcite , primarily with respect to the optical indicators . at 24 @xmath11",
    "m we see a clear connection between the derived star - formation rate and metallicity , but the connection is not as clear at 8 @xmath11 m where other factors must be dominating the dispersion in the relationship between flux density and star - formation rate .    the differences between these star - forming dwarf galaxies and the majority of systems that have been studied in the infrared have two major consequences : ( 1 ) mid - infrared spectral templates do not provide a good fit to the systems , and ( 2 ) the methods that have been developed to determine the star - formation rate from mid - infrared observations do not work well in these systems . because these galaxies are different from the majority of galaxies that have been studied in the mid - infrared , some caution needs to be exercised in fitting spectral templates and deriving mid - infrared star - formation rates , particularly at higher redshift where more information is often not available and where compact star - forming systems may be more prevalent .",

    "<S> the differences in the mid - infrared spectral energy distributions for these galaxies which , in general , are low metallicity systems , indicate differences in the physical properties , heating , and/or distribution of the dust . specifically , these galaxies have more hot dust and/or very small grains and less pah emission than either spiral or higher luminosity starburst galaxies . as has been shown in previous studies , there is a gradual decrease in pah emission as a function of metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> because much of the energy from star formation in galaxies is re - radiated in the mid - infrared , star - formation rate indicators based on both line and continuum measurements in this wavelength range are coming into more common usage . </S>",
