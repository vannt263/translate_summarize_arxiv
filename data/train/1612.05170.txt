    "this is a consequence of the fact that the analytic continuation of @xmath147 into the region of negative @xmath59 has an exponential increase .",
    "however , since we are interested in positive @xmath59 only , in our modeling we will just use the conversion formula ( [ qtmd ] ) for all @xmath59 profiles for which it gives convergent results . for the gaussian model we have then @xmath148      in the space of impact parameters @xmath56 , the gaussian model gives a @xmath149 fall - off , and one may argue that the decrease is too fast for large @xmath56 . in particular , propagators @xmath150 of massive particles have an exponential @xmath151 fall - off for spacelike intervals @xmath41 .    to build models for tmds that resemble more closely the perturbative propagators in the deep spacelike region , we recall that the propagator of a scalar particle with mass @xmath152 may be written as @xmath153 it is the mass term that assures that the propagator falls off exponentially @xmath154 for large spacelike distances . at small intervals",
    "@xmath41 , however , the free particle propagator has a @xmath155 singularity while we want the soft part of @xmath156 to be finite at @xmath157 .",
    "the simplest way is to add a constant term @xmath158 to @xmath41 in the vdf representation ( [ newvdfx ] ) .",

    "the sign of the @xmath161 term is fixed from the requirement that @xmath162 should not have singularities for space - like @xmath41 .",
    "this model corresponds to the following tmd @xmath163 it is finite for reflecting the exponential @xmath164 fall - off for large @xmath56 . to avoid a two - parameter modeling",
    ", one may take @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath166 which corresponds to @xmath167 it has a logarithmic singularity for small @xmath143 that reflects a too slow @xmath168 fall - off for large @xmath56 . for the quasi - distribution",
