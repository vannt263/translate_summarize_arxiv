    "the reflection spectrum of an optical cavity is exquisitely sensitive to motion - driven frequency changes which , when combined with mechanical oscillators , can yield accelerometers of outstanding observation resolution and bandwidth . typically , acceleration is obtained from a direct displacement measurement , and it is in the sensitivity of this observation @xmath3 where the fundamental compromise lies of reaching a particular acceleration resolution @xmath4 over a certain bandwidth @xmath5 : @xmath6 . the higher the sensitivity and the larger the bandwidth needed in acceleration sensing , the more challenging will be the required displacement resolution",
    ". mechanical properties of the oscillator such as the stiffness ( mass and resonance frequency @xmath5 ) and quality factor @xmath7 also play an important role in the sensing limit and transduction of displacement measurement to acceleration , as is explained below .",
    "particularly , for high performance acceleration sensing at room temperature , a combined product of large oscillator mass and high quality factor @xmath8 kg will be needed to achieve high resolution at sub-@xmath9 over a wide bandwidth of several khz .    in experimental gravitational physics ,",
    "remarkably high acceleration resolutions at levels of femto-@xmath0 have been demonstrated by torsion balances over extremely narrow bandwidths below 10mhz , which corresponds to a displacement resolution of approximately 10@xmath10 @xcite . in geodesy and geophysics , superconducting gravimeters",
    "reach acceleration resolutions of the order of pico-@xmath0 over bandwidths below 1hz at displacement resolutions of tens to hundreds of pico-@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , acceleration measurements over wider bandwidths of 10 - 30khz have been realized , however , at tens of micro-@xmath0 levels , translating to a sensitivity in displacement measurement of a few femto-@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "traditional applications require either high acceleration resolution , such as in gravimetry or seismology well below 100hz , or large bandwidths , as for characterizing fast mechanical dynamics and piezo - electric devices , but typically not both .",
    "yet extremely high resolution maintained over large bandwidths of tens of khz are of interest in applications such as inertial navigation of fast moving objects@xcite .",
    "here we present a novel self - calibrating optomechanical device for absolute acceleration sensing that combines both wide bandwidth and exquisite resolution at room temperature , which we have demonstrated to unprecedented sensitivities better than 100nano-@xmath0(1@xmath12=9.81m / s@xmath13 ) over a measurement bandwidth larger than 10khz , between ( 1.5 - 12khz ) .",
    "it consists of a compact(@xmath14 mm ) , high-@xmath2(@xmath15 kg ) fused - silica oscillator that utilizes fiber - optic micro - mirror cavities , for self - calibrated detection of its test - mass motions@xcite .",
    "this device provides substantial improvement over conventional systems in accelerometry standards and calibrations .",
    "fundamentally , acceleration resolution is limited by thermal fluctuations of the test - mass , which for a simple harmonic oscillator at high temperature is given by,@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath18 is temperature , @xmath5 is the natural frequency of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath19 is the oscillator mass , and @xmath7 is the mechanical quality factor .",
    "this shows that high - resolution ( low @xmath20 ) and wide - bandwidth ( large @xmath5 ) acceleration sensing at room temperature , requires a large @xmath2 product , yielding both large mass and high mechanical quality factor .",
    "acceleration and displacement are related by the following transfer function@xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the relative displacement given an input acceleration @xmath23 at an angular frequency @xmath24 .    from equation  [ eqn2 ] , @xmath25-resolution over a 10khz - bandwidth",
    "requires displacement detection sensitivities at levels of @xmath26 .",
    "optical detection schemes such as fabry - prot interferometry offer this type of resolution , with the added benefit of self - calibrating detection due to its intrinsic accuracy and traceability , since the international system of units ( si ) defines length in terms of the wavelength of light .",
    "thus , if the test - mass motion is measured in terms of an optical cavity referenced to a physical standard such as an atomic transition , according to equation  [ eqn2 ] , the only requirement to convert @xmath22 to acceleration is an accurate enough measurement of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "current wavelength and frequency calibrations reach relative accuracies of @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "conventional systems are not able to accurately measure near the mechanical resonance due to the complex system identification required@xcite . therefore , sensitivity enhancements are typically achieved by lowering the sensor s natural frequency and limiting their detection bandwidth significantly below the mechanical resonance ( typically @xmath29 ) .",
    "moreover , state - of - the - art acceleration calibrations are limited to levels of @xmath30@xcite and only at discrete frequency points .",
    "due to the accurate and straightforward system identification capabilities presented in equation  [ eqn2 ] , our optomechanical accelerometer provides self - calibrating measurements at very high sensitivities throughout the entire measurement bandwidth about and even beyond the mechanical resonance , where it reaches the thermal limit over a bandwidth of approximately 1khz .",
    "the device we present here combines a monolithic fused - silica oscillator and a fiber - optic micro - cavity into an absolute reference accelerometer , capable of reaching a resolution below 100@xmath31 over 10khz .",
    "the direct link between the acceleration sensing and the si - traceable laser wavelength provides self - calibrating measurements and the capability to accurately measure around and above the mechanical resonance .",
    "this is possible because the displacement - to - acceleration transfer function ( equation  [ eqn2 ] ) depends only on two parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath5 which are independently measured via a ringdown technique , providing a complete system identification .",

    "the mechanical oscillator was laser - assist micro - machined from@xcite a 2 mm thick fused - silica wafer to produce a monolithic device .",
    "the base of the oscillator was frit - bonded to a fused - silica substrate and the moving portion was suspended over a laser - machined relief .",

    "the resonance peak was determined by spectral analysis and then honed in by a high resolution function generator driving the piezo - shaker .",
    "after discontinuation of shaking , the ac voltage output of the cavity photoreceiver was recorded by a digital voltmeter which provided the envelope of the ring down directly .",
    "the quality factor was determined by an exponential fit to the envelope and compared to the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) with good agreement .",
    "this technique is significantly faster than a high resolution spectrum allowing us to minimize the effect of resonance frequency drifts and enabling multiple trials .",
    "the mass of the oscillator is 25 mg and @xmath35@xmath36 yielding a net product @xmath37 kg and a predicted thermal noise floor of @xmath38n@xmath0 at room temperature .",
    "we utilized a telecom laser at a wavelength of @xmath39 nm with moderate power of approximately 1mw .",
    "a plane - concave fiber - based micro - mirror fabry - prot cavity was built to operate in reflection as the optical sensor .",
    "the mechanical oscillator ground platform and the moving mass were equipped with collinear v - grooves as alignment canals for the fiber - based mirrors .",
    "the flat input mirror consists of a perpendicularly cleaved , dielectrically coated fiber ( 99.7%@xmath40 ) .",
    "the concave cavity end mirror consists of a co@xmath41 laser ablated fiber tip with a high reflectivity dielectric coating ( 8ppm)@xcite . the resulting cavity characteristics were measured to be : finesse @xmath42 , optical quality factor @xmath43 , and visibility @xmath44 .",

    "given the wide tunability range of our laser , it is possible to measure the free spectral range ( fsr ) of the cavity and directly measure the optical cavity length @xmath49 as , @xmath50 which amounts to 172@xmath51 m .",
    "we have chosen a dc cavity readout to best accommodate the short cavity length and finesse properties , for which a pound - drever - hall@xcite scheme is not practical . here , the highest sensitivity of the cavity can be achieved by tuning the laser wavelength to the points @xmath52 where @xmath53 , obtained from the fsr measurement , reaches its maximum value .",
    "cavity length fluctuations @xmath54 translate to laser wavelength fluctuations @xmath55 in a resonant cavity as @xmath56    the effect of cavity length fluctuations d@xmath49 on dynamic changes of the fsr can be neglected given that @xmath57 , being approximately 12 orders of magnitude smaller . by combining equations  [ eqn2 ] ,  [ eqn4 ]  and  [ eqn6 ] , it yields that cavity length changes driven by an acceleration @xmath58 can be measured via voltage fluctuations @xmath59 at the photoreceiver output as , @xmath60 with @xmath61 where the operating laser wavelength for maximum sensitivity @xmath52 is an si - traceable quantity .",
    "the total measured acceleration @xmath58 consists of the following terms : a ) the brownian limited acceleration @xmath20 ( see equation  [ eqn1 ] ) , b ) equivalent acceleration @xmath62 of real test - mass dynamics , and c ) apparent ( no dynamics ) acceleration @xmath63 arising from excess noise in the detection system .",

    "all parameters ( @xmath7,@xmath5,@xmath52,@xmath64,@xmath49 ) are easily measured and are stable .",
    "this inherent relation between acceleration , the laser wavelength and its explicit si - traceability establishes the self - calibrating nature of our optomechanical accelerometer .",
    "the substrate was placed on a passive vibration isolation platform located in a vacuum chamber .",
    "the fiber optic cables were fed into the vacuum chamber through deformable capillaries that are clamped circumferentially around the cables for an air - tight seal .",
    "we used fusion splices to connect the input fiber to the fiber interferometer and laser sources and create a continuous strand of cable .",

    "the latter was measured via a mismatched armlength mach - zehnder fiber interferometer , using a 1 km fiber spool in one arm .",
    "given the rather high finesse accomplished on this type of cavity , we were able to suppress the laser intensity noise to a non - limiting level .",
    "laser frequency noise , on the other hand , is clearly setting the noise floor .",
    "figure  [ accnoise ] shows the linear spectral density of the equivalent acceleration measurement . at lower frequencies of 10 - 100hz",
    "we reach a comparable resolution to conventional devices at micro-@xmath0 levels , and improving to sub-@xmath9 through 1khz .",
    "unprecedented sensitivities below @xmath25 over 10khz is achieved above 1.5khz , and better than @xmath67 slightly above 9khz over approximately 2khz .",
    "noise equivalent acceleration , demonstrating sensitivities below @xmath25 over 10khz ( 1.5 - 12khz).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we are also able to exploit the extraordinary sensitivity enhancement provided by the mechanical resonance due to our capability to conduct a complete and accurate system identification over the entire observation bandwidth , allowing us to reach the brownian acceleration limit around @xmath68 level within 1khz about the mechanical resonance frequency ( 10.7khz ) .    the laser frequency noise sets the noise floor throughout the entire bandwidth .",
    "a 10khz broadband detection sensitivity at the brownian limit of @xmath68 requires a laser frequency stability better than @xmath69 throughout the observation bandwidth .",
    "laser frequency control systems capable of reaching these stability levels , have been previously demonstrated at the thermal limit@xcite , but require complex dedicated laboratory instrumentation .",
    "in addition , ongoing research in laser physics@xcite outline the path for promising laser technologies of similar frequency stability that will be available in the near future which , combined with our optomechanical accelerometer , would enable broadband thermally - limited acceleration sensing .      as a demonstration test of the self - calibrating acceleration sensing characteristics of our device , we have compared it against a calibrated commercial reference accelerometer , wilcoxon 731a / p31@xcite , which has a 3db - bandwidth of 330hz .",
    "we utilized a small piezo - driven shaker to inject a controlled acceleration to both devices at 10hz .",
    "we chose this frequency because , from the only two frequency points ( 10  and  327hz ) quoted in the calibration data sheet of the wilcoxon device , this selected point reports unitary gain .",
    "the acceleration measurement was performed on one device at a time , mounted on the shaker .",

    "the red ( nist ) and blue ( wilcoxon ) traces show quadratic fits corresponding to each data set.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the acceleration peaks measured by both devices come to excellent agreement .",
    "the slight discrepancy in amplitude of approximately 6% can be attributed to differences between the devices in mounting to the shaker table , and moment of inertia .",
    "we have demonstrated a simple self - calibrating optomechanical accelerometer to sensitivities better than @xmath25 over an observation bandwidth of 10khz .",
    "our measurements of mechanical quality factor and mechanical resonance frequency demonstrate an @xmath2 product of 1 kg and a brownian acceleration limit of @xmath68 .",
    "we have also developed and incorporated an optical sensor based on a fabry - prot fiber micro - mirror cavity of finesse 1600 that reaches displacement sensitivities of @xmath1 .",
    "many applications do not require acceleration sensing over such large bandwidths .",
    "design trade - offs to the device concept presented here can be made to better meet the needs of sensitivity and observation bandwidth for other applications .",
    "the simplicity , compactness and traceable high - sensitivity performance over a wide bandwidth accompanied by built - in advanced laser - interferometric detection highlight the novelty of our accelerometer for a wide variety of applications in optomechanics and quantum - limited light - matter interactions , absolute and reference accelerometry , including seismology , and ground and space - based gravimetry .",
