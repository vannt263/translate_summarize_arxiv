    "recent advancements in nanotechnology have offered several practical approaches for the realization of physical , biological or even hybrid nanomachines @xcite . typically , such nanomachines are a few tens nanometers in size and are able to perform simple tasks such as computing , storage , sensing and actuation .",
    "nanomachines with communication capabilities can be interconnected to form a nanonetwork through which complex tasks that may be relevant and necessary for realizing different biomedical , environmental and industrial applications can be executed in a collaborative manner .",
    "one of the most promising paradigms to interconnect nanomachines , especially the biological and bio - physical hybrid ones , to set up a nanonetwork is molecular communication .",
    "molecular communication involves the transmission of information encoded using molecules that physically travel from a transmitter nanomachine to a receiver nanomachine .",
    "several types of molecular transport mechanisms have been studied so far .",
    "broadly , they involve either passive transport of molecules utilizing free particle diffusion dynamics or active transport of molecules using bacterial chemotaxis and molecular motors that generate motion @xcite . in this work , we consider the former diffusion - based passive molecular transport mechanism .",
    "recently , kuran et al .",
    "proposed two different modulation schemes for realizing molecular communication via diffusion : concentration shift keying ( csk ) and molecule shift keying ( mosk ) @xcite .",
    "they are analogous to amplitude shift keying and frequency shift keying , respectively , which have been popularly used in electromagnetic communication for many decades .",
    "csk uses different concentrations ( or simply number ) of molecules to uniquely represent different information symbols while mosk uses different types of molecules for such purpose . for the transmission of @xmath0 information bits in one mosk - modulated symbol , @xmath1 different types of molecules are required .",
    "hence , the complexity of transmitter and receiver nanomachines increases as @xmath0 increases and thus mosk may not be practical .    consider serial transmission of csk - modulated information symbols over a time - slotted diffusion channel as described in section ii .",
    "in such a diffusion channel , for a transmitted information symbol , molecular concentration ( or alternately number of messenger molecules ) observed at the receiver nanomachine is initially ( i.e. at the start of a slot ) zero and it quickly increases until reaching its maximum .",
    "then , the molecular concentration slowly decreases over time resulting in a long - tailed molecular concentration signal that may stretches over several slot durations .",
    "messenger molecules belonging to the tail of the molecular concentration signal of _ previous _ information symbols thus act as the source of interference to the molecular concentration signal of the _ current _ information symbol .",
    "such interference is called inter symbol interference ( isi ) . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", authors have shown that isi significantly deteriorates the decoding performance of the receiver nanomachine .",
    "motivated with this problem , in this letter , we present a robust modulation scheme , zebra - csk , that attempts to reduce isi as much as possible .",
    "we consider a molecular communication system consisting of a pair of transmitter and receiver nanomachines .",
    "the transmitter nanomachine is fixed at the origin of an unbounded three - dimensional stationary fluidic environment while the receiver nanomachine is @xmath2 distance apart from the transmitter nanomachine .",
    "furthermore , we consider the molecular communication system is time - slotted with a slot duration of @xmath3 , and the transmitter and receiver nanomachines are perfectly synchronized . at the transmitter nanomachine ,",
    "a binary csk modulation is employed ; impulse of @xmath4 molecules are released at the start of the slot for binary symbol @xmath5 while no molecules are released for binary symbol @xmath6 .",
    "the encoded information symbols will be conveyed to the receiver nanomachine through molecular diffusion .",
    "once a molecule arrives at the receiver nanomachine , it will be removed from the communication medium .",
    "we assume that all molecules are homogeneous and diffuses independently with respect to other molecules with a common diffusion coefficient found using the einstein relation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the temperature in kelvin , @xmath11 is the viscosity of the fluidic medium , and @xmath12 is the common radius of the molecules .",
    "the receiver nanomachine counts the total number of received molecules ( denoted by a random variable @xmath13 ) at the end of each time slot and applies the following decision rule to determine the transmitted binary symbol :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a pre - specified threshold .",
    "following two classes of molecules are used in the proposed zebra - csk : ( i ) messenger molecules for encoding information symbols , and ( ii ) inhibitor molecules for supressing residual messenger molecules from the previous information symbol .",
    "[ pe1 ]    fig .",
    "1 depicts the high - level flowchart of zebra - csk . in zebra - csk , as the name suggests , types of messenger molecules in subsequent information symbols are altered from _ type a _ messenger molecules ( denoted as m@xmath16 ) to _ type b _ messenger molecules ( denoted as m@xmath17 ) , or vice versa , while the information encoding mechanism is similar with that of the conventional csk .",
    "furthermore , each type of messenger molecules are accompanied by inhibitor molecules of the other type . in other words ,",
    "m@xmath16 molecules are accompanied with the inhibitor of m@xmath17 molecules ( denoted as i@xmath17 ) while m@xmath17 molecules are accompanied with the inhibitor of m@xmath16 molecules ( denoted as i@xmath17 ) .",
    "[ pe1 ]    fig .",
    "2 illustrates temporal molecular - type alternation of both messenger and inhibitor molecules in the proposed zebra - csk . in a given slot duration ,",
    "when one type of messenger molecules are released along with inhibitor of the other type messenger molecules , the late - arriving residual messenger molecules from the previous symbol ( which are of the other type ) are acted upon by the inhibitor molecules . as a consequence",
    ", isi is reduced",
    ". however , it is noteworthy to mention that magnitude of the reduction in isi depends on the efficiency of the used inhibitor molecules .",
    "the impulse of messenger molecules released from the transmitter nanomachine spread out through the fluid medium via diffusion and hence the random motion of the messenger molecules can be represented as brownian motion . following the well developed literature on analysis of brownian motion , probability density function of the time a messenger molecule requires to reach the receiver nanomachine ( referred to as absorbance time of brownian particle in the literature )",
    "can be written as @xmath18 utilizing ( 3 ) , the probability that a molecule reaches the receiver nanomachine within a current slot of @xmath3 can be obtained as @xmath19 define @xmath20 to be a binary random variable indicating whether a @xmath21-th molecule among @xmath4 molecules released by the transmitter nanomachine at the beginning of a slot arrives at the receiver nanomachine before the slot ends , i.e. @xmath22 if the molecule arrives within @xmath3 and @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "thus , considering @xmath20 , we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a random variable denoting the total number of molecules received at the receiver nanomachine within @xmath3 .",
    "given the number of the transmitted molecules @xmath4 , from ( 5 ) it can be seen that @xmath25 follows the binomial distribution , i.e. @xmath26 . for large @xmath4 , distribution of @xmath25 can be approximated as guassian distribution with the knowledge of its mean and variance as @xmath27 note that distribution of @xmath25 does not consider the late arriving messenger molecules from the previous symbols .",
    "let @xmath28 be a random variable denoting the total number of messenger molecules received at the receiver nanomachine among the @xmath4 molecules released in the previous slot .",
    "it is evident that @xmath28 is also binomially distributed as @xmath25 , and can be approximated as @xmath29 where @xmath30 for a given inhibition efficiency @xmath31 of the inhibitor molecules .",
    "based on ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) the distribution of a random variable representing the number of messenger molecules that may cause inter symbol interference , denoted by @xmath32 , thus can be expressed as @xmath33 utilizing distributions of @xmath25 and @xmath32 in ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) , we next calculate the channel capacity and also derive the symbol error performance of the receiver nanomachine for the proposed modulation scheme .",
    "consider serial transmission of information symbols where binary symbols @xmath5 and @xmath6 occur with _ a priori _ probabilities equal to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "in such a serial transmission , probabilities of correct detection of a transmitted symbol at the receiver nanomachine ( probability that @xmath6 is received when @xmath6 is transmitted and @xmath5 is received when @xmath5 is transmitted ) , can be expressed as @xmath36 , \\",

    "3 shows mutual information between the zebra - csk modulated binary symbols transmitted by the transmitter nanomachine and binary symbols received by the receiver nanomachine .",
    "for all three considered cases of inhibition efficiency of the inhibitor molecules ( viz . @xmath60 and @xmath61 )",
    ", mutual information increases with increase in the detection threshold value until reaching its maximum but starts to fall with further increase in the detection threshold .",
    "note that zebra - csk with null inhibition efficiency ( i.e. @xmath61 ) is logically equivalent to the conventional csk . from the figure it is evident that higher mutual information can be achieved between zebra - csk",
    "modulated transmitted symbols and received symbols by selecting a relatively smaller detection threshold than the one that maximizes the mutual information between csk modulated symbols and the received symbols .",
    "the higher mutual information in zebra - csk thus results in higher channel capacity .",
    "for instance , for the considered @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath34 and @xmath62 values , channel capacity of zebra - csk is @xmath63 and @xmath64 higher than that of csk when @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "4 shows symbol error performance of the receiver nanomachine while demodulating zebra - csk modulated binary symbols .",
    "the symbol error probability of zebra - csk is significantly lower than that of the conventional csk for most of the possible detection threshold values that are smaller than the optimum detection threshold value for csk .",
    "interestingly , the higher the inhibition efficiency of the inhibitor molecules is , the higher will be the reduction in the symbol error probability .",
    "for instance , for the considered @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath34 and @xmath62 values , minimum achievable symbol error probability of zebra - csk ( i.e at optimum detection threshold ) is @xmath67 when @xmath65 and @xmath68 when @xmath66 .",
    "these are clearly @xmath69 and @xmath70 improvement over the minimum achievable symbol error probability of @xmath71 in the conventional csk .",
    "[ pe1 ]    [ pe2 ]    [ pe3 ]    fig .",
    "5 shows symbol error performance of the receiver nanomachine located at various distance from the transmitter nanomachine . for a given detection threshold , the symbol error probability increases as the distance between transmitter and receiver nanomachine increases .",
    "symbol error probability of zebra - csk is always lower than that of the conventional csk regardless of the distance between transmitter and receiver nanomachine .",
    "it is note worthy to mention that , except for very higher inhibition efficiencies closer to @xmath5 , symbol error performance gain of zebra - csk over csk ( i.e difference between the symbol error probabilities of csk and zebra - csk ) increases with an increase in the distance between transmitter and receiver nanomachine .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a new modulation technique ( named as zebra - csk ) for transmitting information symbols over diffusive channel in nanoscale molecular communication networks .",
    "the proposed modulation technique is robust in the sense that it reduces inter symbol interferences among subsequently transmitted information symbols .",
    "reduction in the inter symbol interference depends on the efficiency of the molecules used to inhibit the messenger molecules . through numerical analysis",
    "we have shown that symbol detection error probability of a receiver nanomachine is lower for demodulating zebra - csk modulated binary information symbols than demodulating the conventional csk modulated binary information symbols . as a future work",
    ", we plan to analyze and quantify the performance of the proposed zebra - csk for quaternary and even higher order modulations ."
