    "in einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory in @xmath0 dimensions the unique family of stationary asymptotically flat black holes comprises the rotating kerr - newman ( kn ) and kerr black holes and the static reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) and schwarzschild black holes .",
    "em black holes are uniquely determined by their mass , their electric and magnetic charge , and their angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the generalization of black hole solutions to higher dimensions was pioneered by tangherlini @xcite for static vacuum black holes , and by myers and perry @xcite for stationary vacuum black holes . whereas myers and perry @xcite also obtained charged static black holes in higher dimensional em theory , higher dimensional charged rotating black holes",
    "have not yet been obtained in pure em theory , although such black holes are known for some low energy effective actions related to string theory @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional black holes received much interest in recent years also with the advent of brane - world theories , raising the possibility of direct observation in future high energy colliders @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness theorems of em theory in @xmath0 dimensions can not be generalized to higher dimensions , unless one makes restrictions , in particular with respect to the horizon topology @xcite . indeed ,",
    "there exist black rings , i.e. , solutions with horizon topology of a torus @xcite . restricting to black holes with horizon topology of a sphere ,",
    "we here consider charged rotating em black holes in @xmath1 dimensions , which are asymptotically flat , possess a regular event horizon , and in general possess two independent angular momenta , associated with two distinct planes of rotation .",
    "recently , such black holes have been studied perturbatively , in the limit of small charge @xcite .",
    "we investigate the physical properties of these black holes .",
    "we obtain their mass @xmath2 , their angular momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and their electric charge @xmath5 from an asymptotic expansion . for generic values of the charge ,",
    "their gyromagnetic ratios deviate from the perturbative values , @xmath6 @xcite . from an expansion at the horizon we determine their horizon area @xmath7 , their surface gravity @xmath8 , their horizon velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and their horizon electrostatic potential @xmath11 .",
    "we then show , that these black holes satisfy a generalized smarr formula @xcite @xmath12    to construct these charged rotating black holes numerically , for finite values of the charge , we employ an ansatz for the metric which is inspired by the parametrization of myers and perry @xcite , but based on bi - azimuthal isotropic coordinates .",
    "this parametrization of the metric corresponds to a generalization of the ansatz employed previously for rotating black holes in @xmath0 dimensions , well suited for numerical work @xcite .",
    "the ansatz for the gauge potential follows from the symmetries @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we recall the em action , and present the stationary axially symmetric ansatz .",
    "we discuss the black hole properties in section 3 , and derive the generalized smarr formula in section 4 .",
    "we present some numerical results in section 5 , focussing on black holes with a single angular momentum and with two equal - magnitude angular momenta .",
    "we consider the 5-dimensional einstein - maxwell action @xmath13 with curvature scalar @xmath14 , newton s constant @xmath15 , and field strength tensor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the gauge potential .",
    "variation of the action with respect to the metric and the gauge potential leads to the einstein equations and the gauge field equations , respectively , @xmath18 @xmath19    to obtain stationary black hole solutions , representing charged generalizations of the 5-dimensional myers - perry solutions @xcite , we consider black hole space - times with bi - azimuthal symmetry , implying the existence of three commuting killing vectors , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we employ a parametrization for the metric , based on bi - azimuthal isotropic coordinates , well suited for numerical work , corresponding to a generalization of the ansatz employed previously for rotating black holes in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite @xmath23 the metric has two orthogonal 2-planes of rotation , corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where elementary flatness requires @xmath26 the gauge potential is parametrized by @xcite @xmath27 all metric and gauge field functions depend on @xmath28 and @xmath29 only .",
    "the mass @xmath2 and the angular momenta @xmath30 of the black hole @xcite , are obtained from the asymptotic expansion for the metric @xcite , @xmath31 while the charge @xmath5 and the magnetic moments @xmath32 @xcite , are obtained from the asymptotic expansion for the gauge potential @xcite , @xmath33 and yield the gyromagnetic ratios @xmath34",

    "as required by the zeroth law of black hole mechanics , the surface gravity @xmath8 @xcite @xmath43 is constant at the horizon .",
    "the expansion at the horizon @xcite shows furthermore , that the electrostatic potential @xmath44 is constant at the horizon as well , @xmath45",
    "to obtain the general mass formula , we recall the komar expressions for the mass @xmath2 and the angular momenta @xmath30 @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 the horizon mass @xmath48 and horizon angular momenta @xmath49 are obtained by performing the integrations in eqs .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] exploiting the expansions for the metric and the gauge potential , we note , that the only non - vanishing contribution to the integral @xmath57 comes from its first part , evaluated at the horizon , @xmath64 since the electrostatic potential @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ esp ] ) , is constant at the horizon , @xmath65 where @xmath5 is the electric charge @xcite .",
    "this yields the mass formula ( [ mass ] ) @xmath66",
    "to obtain asymptotically flat solutions , we impose on the metric functions at infinity the boundary conditions @xmath67 for the gauge potential we choose a gauge where it vanishes at infinity , @xmath68    the horizon is located at @xmath69 , and is characterized by the condition @xmath70 @xcite . requiring the horizon to be regular ,",
    "we obtain for the metric functions the boundary conditions @xmath71 where @xmath72 are constants determining the horizon angular velocities @xmath73 .",
    "the gauge potential satisfies @xmath74    the boundary conditions in the planes @xmath75 and @xmath76 are determined by symmetries .",
    "the metric functions satisfy @xmath77 while the gauge field functions satisfy at @xmath75 @xmath78 and at @xmath76 @xmath79    for the numerical calculations we introduce the compactified radial variable @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "we perform the numerical calculations with help of the package fidisol @xcite , based on the newton - raphson method . for black holes with two independent angular momenta , we generically have to solve a system of 10 partial differential equations . in the special case of black holes with a single angular momentum ,",
    "we retain only a system of 7 partial differential equations , since the functions @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 vanish identically . in the second special case of black holes with two equal - magnitude angular momenta the angular dependence of the functions",
    "can be extracted @xcite , leaving a system of 6 ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "these black holes are therefore obtained with much higher numerical accuracy .",
    "turning to the numerical results , we focus here on black holes with a single angular momentum and black holes with two equal - magnitude angular momenta . in both cases we need to consider only a single function @xmath84 .",
    "as we increase @xmath85 from zero , while keeping @xmath69 and @xmath5 fixed , a branch of rotating black hole solutions emerges from the corresponding static black hole .",
    "this lower branch extends up to a maximal value of @xmath85 , which depends on @xmath69 and @xmath5 . from the maximal value",
    "@xmath86 a second branch , the upper branch , bends backwards towards @xmath87 . along both branches mass and angular momentum continuously increase , as seen in fig .  1 , where we exhibit the mass @xmath2 and the angular momentum @xmath88 for black holes with a single angular momentum and black holes with two equal - magnitude angular momenta as functions of @xmath85 for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , 1 , 3 and 5 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the horizon area parameter @xmath41 as well as the surface gravity @xmath8 for the same set of solutions .",
    "the horizon area increases monotonically along both branches , and the surface gravity decreases monotonically , tending to zero for large black holes .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the horizon electrostatic potential @xmath11 and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath92 for these solutions . while close to the perturbative value @xmath93 @xcite , we observe deviations from this value of up to a few percent for larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , for black holes with a single angular momentum these deviations are negative , while they are positive for black holes with two equal - magnitude angular momenta @xcite .    finally , in fig .",
    "4 we show the mass @xmath2 and the angular momentum @xmath94 for black holes with a single angular momentum and black holes with two equal - magnitude angular momenta as functions of the isotropic horizon radius @xmath69 for @xmath95 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , 1 , 3 and 5 .    further details and numerical results for the general case of two nonequal - magnitude angular momenta will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have considered charged rotating black holes in 5-dimensional einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "these black holes are asymptotically flat , they possess a regular horizon of spherical topology and two independent angular momenta associated with two distinct planes of rotation .",
    "our appoach has been analytical concerning the expansions at infinity , at the horizon , and in the symmetry planes , and numerical concerning the actual construction of the black holes . in particular , we have introduced a metric parametrization , based on bi - azimuthal isotropic coordinates , well suited for numerical work .",
    "we have studied the physical properties of these black holes , in particular their global charges and horizon properties , and obtained a generalized smarr formula for these black holes .",
    "interestingly , for generic values of the charge their gyromagnetic ratios differ from the value @xmath6 , obtained for weakly charged em black holes @xcite ( or certain supersymmetric black holes @xcite ) .    in the numerical construction of the black holes",
    "we here have focussed on black holes with a single angular momentum and black holes with two equal - magnitude angular momenta . in the latter case ,",
    "the angular dependence of the metric and gauge field functions is obtained explicitly , leaving only a set of ordinary differential equations to be solved numerically .",
    "further details of these black hole solutions and numerical results for black holes with two nonequal - magnitude angular momenta will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    while analytical construction of the exact 5-dimensional charged rotating em black holes still presents an outstanding challenge , we hope , that the numerical solutions presented here will be helpful in achieving this goal .",
    "the ansatz introduced to parametrize the metric of the 5-dimensional rotating em black holes should also allow for the numerical construction of rotating black holes of theories containing further matter fields .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of a dilaton might lead to interesting phenomena .",
    "already in @xmath0 dimensions the presence of a dilaton yields new surprising features , such as counterrotating black holes @xcite .",
