    "explorations of multiqubit entanglement have unearthed several families of states with curious quantum properties and there have been many attempts in recent years to characterize all the denizens of this quantum zoo  @xcite .",

    "pure entangled states of three qubits fall into two categories , namely the ghz- or the w - class , under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc )  @xcite with the maximally entangled ghz and w states being given by : @xmath2 the entanglement of the ghz state is fragile under qubit loss , i.e when any one of the qubits is traced out , the other two qubits become completely disentangled  @xcite .",
    "hence if one of the parties decides not to cooperate , the entanglement resources of the ghz state can not be used . in contradistinction to the ghz state , the w - state residual bipartite entanglement is robust against qubit loss  @xcite .    it has been shown by linden et .",
    "that almost every pure state of three qubits can be completely determined by its two - party reduced density matrices  @xcite .",
    "the two inequivalent entangled states , namely the w and ghz states , have contrasting irreducibility features : while ghz states have irreducible correlations and can not be determined from their two - party marginals  @xcite , w - states are completely determined by their two - party marginals  @xcite .",
    "tripartite entanglement has been studied experimentally using optics  @xcite and nmr  @xcite .",
    "recently , the entanglement properties of a permutation symmetric superposition of the @xmath3 state and its obverse @xmath4 have been characterized  @xcite : @xmath5 while this state ( referred to henceforth as the @xmath6 state ) belongs to the ghz entanglement class , its correlation information ( in contrast to the ghz state ) is uniquely contained in its two - party reduced states . the argument for reconstructing the three - qubit @xmath1 state from its two - party reduced states runs along similar lines to the original argument of linden et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "if we assume another state to have the same two - party reduced density matrices as the @xmath0 state , this constraint can be used to prove that the new state is no different from the original @xmath0 state  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 state .",
    "we provide an explicit measurement - based filtration scheme to filter out the @xmath7 state from the @xmath8 state .",
    "further , we experimentally construct and tomograph the @xmath0 state on an nmr quantum information processor of three coupled qubits .",
    "we experimentally demonstrate that the information about tripartite correlations present in this state can indeed be completely captured by its two - party reduced density matrices .",
    "we reconstruct the experimental density matrices using complete state tomography and compare them with the theoretically expected states and also compute state fidelities .",
    "the ghz class of states are an important computational resource  @xcite and it has been shown that states that are slocc equivalent to these can be used for the same kind of quantum information processing tasks  @xcite . therefore , it is expected that the @xmath6 state will also prove useful for quantum computation . furthermore , the quantification of the tripartite correlation information present in this state is easier as compared to the ghz state , as entanglement measurement requires only two - qubit detectors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ filter ] describes how we obtain the @xmath9 state from the @xmath10 state by local filtration based on projective measurements using a register of three ancilla qubits .",
    "section  [ nmr ] describes the experimental creation of the @xmath11 superposition state on a three - qubit nmr quantum information processor .",

    "the information content of the @xmath11 as captured from its two - party marginals is described in section  [ tomo - wwbar ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concl ] with some remarks about ghz and w@xmath12 types of three - qubit entanglement and the relationship between entanglement class and how information about entanglement is stored in a quantum state .",
    "measurement - based local filters have been used for entanglement manipulation in the context of violation of bell inequalities as well as for the detection of bound entangled states  @xcite .",
    "no local operations can convert a state from the ghz class to the w class .",
    "however , surprisingly , it has been shown that the @xmath13 is in the ghz class , deriving from the fact that it is related to the ghz state via the slocc class of operations given by  @xcite : @xmath14 with @xmath15 being an ilo , where @xmath16 denotes the cube root of unity .",
    "we have used ` @xmath17 ' instead of an equality sign in eqn .",

    "we now proceed to reinterpret @xmath18 as an action on an ensemble of identically prepared states @xmath6 and implement the operation described in eqn .",
    "( [ relationship ] ) . in this process",
    ", we will have to discard some copies and the new ensemble that we construct with each member in the filtered ghz state will have fewer copies as compared to the original ensemble of @xmath0 states .",
    "these aspects will be brought out more clearly when we describe the measurement - based filtration protocol to realize the ilo .    since @xmath18 acts on each of the qubits locally , we first want to realize the operation @xmath18 on a single qubit . the non - unitary operator @xmath18 has a singular valued decomposition @xmath19 where the unitary operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 and the non - unitary diagonal operator @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unitary and can be implemented via a local hamiltonian evolution .",
    "therefore , we now turn to the implementation of @xmath23 on a one - qubit state .    from the two columns of the operator @xmath23 we define two vectors @xmath25 these vectors",
