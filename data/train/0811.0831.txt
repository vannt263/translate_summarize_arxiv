    "we present an idea to use the fermilab tevatron to produce very large samples of @xmath5 mesons that decay via @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the decay time distribution of the `` wrong - sign '' @xmath7 decay is sensitive to @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing parameters @xmath8 and  @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , comparing the @xmath0 decay time distribution to that for @xmath1 allows one to measure or constrain the -violating ( ) parameters @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "this method has been used previously by fermilab experiments e791  @xcite and e831  @xcite to search for @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing . however , those experiments ran in the 1990 s and reconstructed only a few hundred flavor - tagged @xmath7 decays .",
    "technological advances in vertexing detectors and electronics made since e791 and e831 ran now make a much improved fixed - target experiment possible . here",
    "we estimate the expected sensitivity of such an experiment and compare it to that of the @xmath2 factory experiments  and .",
    "those experiments have reconstructed several thousand signal decays and , using these samples along with those for , have made the first observation of @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing  @xcite .",
    "we also compare the estimated sensitivity to that of hadron experiments cdf and lhcb .",
    "although we focus on measuring @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , a much broader charm physics program is possible at a tevatron experiment .",
    "we estimate the signal yield expected by scaling from two previous fixed - target experiments , e791 at fermilab and  at desy .",
    "these experiments had center - of - mass energies and detector geometries similar to those that a charm experiment at the tevatron would have",
    ".      took data with various trigger configurations .",
    "one configuration used a minimum bias trigger , and from this data set the experiment reconstructed @xmath13 @xmath5-tagged `` right - sign '' @xmath14 decays in @xmath15 hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "this yield was obtained after all selection requirements were applied . multiplying this rate by the ratio of doubly - cabibbo - suppressed to cabibbo - favored",
    "decays @xmath16",
    "@xcite gives a rate of reconstructed , tagged  decays per hadronic interaction of @xmath17 . to estimate the sample size",
    "a tevatron experiment would reconstruct , we assume the experiment could achieve a similar fractional rate .",
    "if the experiment ran at an interaction rate of 7  mhz ( which was achieved by  using a two - track trigger configuration ) , and took data for @xmath18 live seconds per year , then it would nominally reconstruct @xmath19 flavor - tagged  decays per year , or 192000 decays in three years of running .",
    "here we have assumed a trigger efficiency of 50% relative to that of  , as the trigger would need to be more restrictive than the minimum bias configuration of .",
    "fermilab e791 was a charm hadroproduction experiment that took data during the 1991 - 1992 fixed target run .",
    "the experiment ran with a modest transverse - energy threshold trigger , and it reconstructed 35 @xmath5-tagged  decays in @xmath20 hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a rate of @xmath21 reconstructed decays per hadronic interaction . assuming a future tevatron experiment achieves this fractional rate , one estimates a signal yield of @xmath22 per year , or 207000 in three years .",
    "this value is similar to that obtained by scaling from .",
    "we have assumed the same trigger+reconstruction efficiency as that of e791 , for lack of better knowledge .",
    "we note that e791 had an inactive region in the middle of the tracking stations where the @xmath23 beam passed through , and a future tevatron experiment could avoid this acceptance loss .",
    "we do not include any improvement for this in our projection .",
    "we compare these yields with those that will be attained by the @xmath2 factory experiments after they have analyzed all their data .",
    "the  experiment reconstructed 4024 @xmath5-tagged  decays in 400  of data  @xcite , and it is expected to record a total of 1000  when it completes running .",
    "this integrated luminosity corresponds to 10060 signal events .",
    "the  experiment reconstructed 4030 tagged  decays in 384  of data  @xcite , and the experiment recorded a total of 484  when it completed running in early  2008 .",
    "thus the total  data set corresponds to 5080 signal events . adding this to the estimated final yield from   gives a total of 15100  decays .",
    "this is less than 8% of the yield estimated for a tevatron experiment in three years of running .",
    "the cdf experiment has reconstructed 12700 tagged  decays in 1.5  of data  @xcite , and it is expected to record a total of 7 - 8  when the tevatron stops running .",
    "this data set would correspond to @xmath2464000 signal decays , which is similar to what a future fixed - target tevatron experiment would record in one year of running .",
    "such a sample from cdf would demonstrate the charm physics capability of a hadroproduction experiment at the tevatron .",
    "the kek - b accelerator where  runs is scheduled to be upgraded to a `` super-@xmath2 '' factory running at a luminosity of @xmath25  @xmath26s@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "there is also a proposal to construct a super-@xmath2 factory in italy near the i.n.f.n .",
    "frascati laboratory  @xcite .",
    "an experiment at either of these facilities would reconstruct very large samples of @xmath28 decays , and in fact the resulting sensitivity to @xmath29 and @xmath30 may be dominated by systematic uncertainties . this merits further study .",
    "we note that the systematic errors obtained at a future tevatron experiment are expected to be smaller than those at an @xmath31 collider experiment , due to the superior vertex resolution and @xmath32 identification possible with a forward - geometry detector .",
    "the lhcb experiment has a forward geometry and is expected to reconstruct @xmath28 decays in which the @xmath5 originates from a @xmath2 decay . the resulting sensitivity to mixing parameters",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 has been studied in ref .",
    "this study assumes a @xmath33 cross section of 500  @xmath34b and estimates several unknown trigger and reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "it concludes that approximately 58000 signal decays would be reconstructed in 2  of data , which corresponds to one year of running .",
    "this yield is similar to that estimated for a tevatron experiment .",
    "however , lhcb s trigger is efficient only for @xmath35 mesons having high @xmath36 , i.e. , those produced from @xmath2 decays .",
    "this introduces two complications :    1",
    ".   some fraction of prompt @xmath37 decays will be mis - reconstructed or undergo multiple scattering and , after being paired with a random soft pion , will end up in the  sample ( fitted for @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "as the production rate of prompt @xmath35 s is @xmath38two orders of magnitude larger than that of @xmath2 s , this component may be non - negligible and thus would need to be well - understood when fitting .",
    "2 .   to obtain the @xmath5 vertex position ( i.e. , the origin point of the @xmath0 )",
    ", the experiment must reconstruct a @xmath39 vertex , and the efficiency for this is not known .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate it is 51%  @xcite , but there is uncertainty in this value .",
    "the lhcb study found that , for @xmath40 , a signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath41 ) of 0.40 , and a decay time resolution ( @xmath42 ) of 75  ps , the statistical errors obtained for @xmath29 and @xmath30 were @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "these values are less than half of those that we estimate can be attained by the @xmath2 factories by scaling current errors by @xmath45 : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . as the signal yield ,",
    "@xmath41 , and @xmath42 of a future tevatron experiment are similar to those for lhcb , we expect that similar errors for @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be attained .    to check these estimates , we have done a `` toy '' monte carlo ( mc ) study to estimate the sensitivity of a tevatron experiment .",
    "the results obtained are similar to those of lhcb : for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50  ps , and a minimum decay time cut of @xmath51 ( to reduce combinatorial background ) , we find @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these errors are the rms s of the distributions of residuals obtained from fitting an ensemble of 200 experiments .",
    "a typical fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymc_fit ] .",
    "if we assume the @xmath54 and @xmath55 errors obtained in our toy mc study ( which are close to the values obtained in the lhcb study ) , we can estimate the resulting sensitivity to  parameters @xmath3 and  @xmath12 .",
    "the first parameter characterizes  in the mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , while the second parameter is a phase that characterizes  resulting from interference between an amplitude with mixing and a direct decay amplitude . in the standard model , @xmath3 and @xmath12",
    "are essentially 1 and 0 , respectively ; a measurable deviation from these values would indicate new physics .    to calculate the sensitivity to @xmath3 and @xmath12",
    ", we do a global fit of eight underlying parameters to 28 measured observables .",
    "the fitted parameters are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , strong phases @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 , and  parameters @xmath59 and  @xmath12 .",
    "our fit is analogous to that done by the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite ; the only difference is that we reduce the errors for @xmath29 and @xmath30 according to our toy mc study , and we also reduce the error for @xmath60 by a similar fraction .",
    "this latter parameter is measured by fitting the decay time distribution of   decays , which would also be triggered on and reconstructed by a tevatron charm experiment .",
    "the results of the fit are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_results]b .",
    "the figure shows two - dimensional likelihood contours for @xmath3 and  @xmath12 ; for comparison , the analogous hfag plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_results]a .",
    "one sees that a future tevatron experiment would yield a very substantial improvement .",
    "in summary , we note the following and conclude :    * @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing is now established , and attention has turned to the question of whether there is  in this system . * technical advances in detectors and electronics made since the last fermilab fixed - target experiments ran would make a new experiment much more sensitive to mixing and  effects .",
    "silicon strips and pixels for vertexing are well - developed , and detached - vertex - based trigger concepts and prototypes exist ( e.g. , , cdf , btev , lhcb ) . * such an experiment would have substantially better sensitivity to mixing and  than all  and  data together will provide .",
    "the tevatron data should have less background than lhcb data .",
    "systematic uncertainties may also be less than those of the @xmath2 factory experiments and lhcb . *",
    "the tevatron and requisite beamlines are essentially available .",
    "* such an experiment could help untangle whatever signals for new physics appear at the tevatron or lhc .",
    "recently , a working group has formed to study the physics potential of a charm experiment at the tevatron in more detail .",
