    "early - type galaxies , the ellipticals and lenticulars , are generally poorer in cold gas than spirals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this fact is , of course , ultimately responsible for the color difference between early- and late - type galaxies and their locations in the red sequence or the blue cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , cold atomic and molecular gas are not entirely absent from all early - type galaxies , and therein lie some important clues to both the past and the future of early - type galaxies",
    ". the origin of the cold gas in early - type galaxies can serve as a tracer of their assembly histories , and the properties of the cold gas ( the raw material for star formation ) offer insights into possible morphological and dynamical evolution through star formation .",
    "@xcite predicted that mass loss from evolved stars in early - type galaxies should produce detectable amounts of gas over a hubble time . more recent work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes predictions which are different quantitatively but not qualitatively .",
    "of course , it is likely that the gas recycled into the interstellar medium will have a complex thermal history , including heating to x - ray temperatures and possible cooling all the way to the formation of molecules @xcite .",
    "but since the stellar mass loss is unavoidable and @xcite have shown that the dusty ejecta can cool to molecular temperatures in galaxy centers , it is very natural to expect that some early - type galaxies could contain cold gas .",
    "in fact , as @xcite have alluded , the question of why there are early - type galaxies _ without _ cold gas may be just as interesting as why there are early - type galaxies with cold gas .    however , if the cold gas ultimately originated in the stars , one might expect a correlation between the luminosity of an early - type galaxy and its cold gas content , which has not been seen @xcite .",
    "the _ lack _ of such a correlation is then often used to suggest that whatever molecular gas does exist in early - type galaxies is completely unrelated to the internal stellar mass loss , having been acquired from external sources such as a satellite galaxy or perhaps even the intergalactic medium . in a slightly more sophisticated analysis of both the atomic and molecular gas contents of lenticular galaxies ,",
    "@xcite hypothesized a variation on this theme in which the atomic gas could be of external origin whereas the molecular gas could be of internal origin .    due to the complex nature of the thermal evolution of the stellar mass loss , plus",
    "environmentally dependent interaction with an intracluster medium and potential time - dependent effects of agn feedback on the ism , we argue that the total gas masses by themselves do not offer compelling answers about the origin of the cold gas in early - type galaxies .",
    "however , a comparison of the gaseous and stellar angular momenta should provide much stronger constraints .",
    "the distribution and kinematics of the gas can reveal recent gravitational interactions , and gas which is counterrotating with respect to the stars almost certainly did not originate in those stars . maps which resolve the molecular gas are thus crucial tools which help us to read the assembly histories of early - type galaxies .",
    "molecular gas in early - type galaxies is also particularly interesting because such gas is the raw material for star formation activity . in recent years there have been suggestions that current - day star formation is taking place in as many as 30% of early - type galaxies at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such inferences are at least superficially consistent with the co detection rates found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . but the distribution of the molecular gas will determine whether the star formation takes place in a nuclear starburst or in an extended disk and , therefore , it will also determine the efficiency with which agn feedback could disrupt the star formation .",
    "testing our theoretical understanding of star formation in early - type galaxies also requires estimates of the molecular disk sizes and gas surface densities .",
    "thus , resolved maps of molecular gas hold the keys to understanding the morphological evolution of early - type galaxies through star formation .",
    "we begin to address these issues on the past and future of early - type galaxies through interferometric maps which resolve the co emission in four nearby lenticular galaxies .",
    "total molecular masses are commonly available for s0s , but resolved co maps are rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the four presented here represent a significant addition to the literature on the subject . in all four cases the molecular gas",
    "is found in kpc - scale disks , and in one case the molecular gas counterrotates with respect to the stars .",
    "we also present comparisons between the co kinematics and circular velocity curves derived independently from stellar kinematic data .",
    "we discuss the origin of the gas and its implications for mass modeling .",
    "a forthcoming paper will also present comparisons to the stellar populations in the galaxies and their ionized gas properties , with special emphasis on the distribution and kinematics of the young stellar population , showing clear evidence for disk growth through star formation .",
    "the four galaxies ngc  3032 , ngc  4150 , ngc  4459 , and ngc  4526 were observed because of their membership in the sauron integral - field survey of early - type galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which means that detailed maps of the stellar kinematics , ionized - gas kinematics , and stellar populations are available for the regions within an effective radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they also have co detections @xcite , making them suitable for high spatial resolution comparisons of the stellar and molecular disks .",
    "basic parameters of the galaxies are summarized in table [ sampletable ] .",
    "ngc  3032 is a relatively faint ( @xmath2 ) field lenticular with complex stellar kinematics .",
    "having high angular momentum per unit mass , it belongs to the so - called fast rotator class @xcite , and has a small counter - rotating core ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ionised gas is co - spatial with dusty spiral arms extending to about an effective radius @xmath4 and is also counter - rotating @xcite .",
    "emission is the strongest in the sauron sample while the ratio [ ] /h@xmath5  is weakest ( except in the very center ) .",
    "the absorption linestrength distributions are unusual , suggesting young stars everywhere with a lower metallicity and @xmath6-enhancement in the center ( @xcite ; kuntschner et al .  08 , in prep . ) , probably indicating a recent starburst .",
    "ngc  4150 belongs to the coma  i cloud and is low - luminosity ( @xmath7 ) lenticular in many respects similar to ngc  3032 .",
    "it is a fast rotator @xcite with moderate rotation and a dip in the central velocity dispersion @xcite , and also harbours a central counter - rotating core @xcite where messy dust is found .",
    "contrary to ngc  3032 , however , the extended ionised gas is co - rotating with the bulk of the stars , although slightly misaligned @xcite .",
    "the linestrengths again indicate young stars everywhere , particularly in the center , but the metallicity and @xmath6 elements are rather flat ( @xcite ; kuntschner et al .",
    "08 , in prep . ) .",
    "ngc  4459 is an average ( @xmath8 ) virgo lenticular with rapid rotation and the pinch of the stellar isovelocity contours characteristic of decoupled central disks @xcite .",
    "this disk is co - spatial with a regular but flocculent dust disk and rapidly rotating ionised - gas with low [ ] /h@xmath5  ratio ( except in the very center ; @xcite ) .",
    "the linestrengths indicate much younger stars and higher metallicity in the central disk ( @xcite ; kuntschner et al .",
    "08 , in prep . ) .",
    "ngc  4526 is a virgo lenticular similar to ngc  4459 but slightly brighter ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it harbours what is probably the strongest decoupled central stellar disk in the sauron sample ( observed nearly edge - on ) , embedded in a more slowly rotating bulge @xcite .",
    "the bulge has a slight triaxiality which suggests the presence of a bar . a rather large but regular dust and ionised - gas disk is co - spatial with the stellar disk , and has uniformly low [ ] /h@xmath5  ratio @xcite .",
    "the linestrengths clearly show that the central disk is much younger and metal rich than the bulk of the galaxy ( @xcite ; kuntschner et al .",
    "08 , in prep . ) .",
    "the four galaxies studied here thus fall naturally into two classes .",
    "ngc  3032 and ngc  4150 are relatively faint and have low velocity dispersion , but harbour small counter - rotating cores and have extended marginally ordered gaseous disks with pervasive young stars .",
    "ngc  4459 and ngc",
    "4526 have rapid rotation but even more rapidly co - rotating decoupled ( and spatially well - constrained ) central stellar disks , co - spatial with regular dust disk populated with young stars . the former thus point to a more troubled recent past , perhaps involving accretion or minor mergers , while the latter suggest a more peaceful immediate past dominated by secular evolution .",
    "the current molecular gas observations should thus allow to build on these data and test those ideas further .",

    "they have advocated use of the co line width to trace the galaxy s maximum circular velocity , hence its velocity dispersion ( especially at high redshift where it is currently easier to measure the co line width than other dynamical indicators of the galaxy mass ) .",
    "these studies use a co tully - fisher relation to demonstrate that the co line widths do indeed trace their host galaxies maximum circular velocity .",
    "our detailed comparison of molecular kinematics and circular velocities supports this claim when the co velocities and circular velocities at large radii are considered , even for early - type galaxies where the tully - fisher relation is not traditionally applied .",
    "figure [ n4150majax ] compares the co position - velocity diagram in ngc  4150 to the inferred circular velocity . in this case",
    "the total velocity range covered by the molecular gas is nearly as large as what would be expected from the circular velocity curve .",
    "the co velocities are also nearly equal to the mean stellar velocities at radii @xmath89 10 , which is qualitatively consistent with the fact that the observed stellar velocity dispersions are much smaller than in ngc  4459 and ngc  4526 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the adopted inclination for the galaxy , while consistent with the axis ratio of the dust ring , may not be appropriate for the molecular gas which is concentrated in the nuclear dust lane .",
    "detailed models are probably not yet useful for these data , and the most that can be said is that the inferred circular velocity curve is not inconsistent with the observed co and stellar velocities .",
    "in contrast to the cases of ngc  4459 and ngc  4526 , there are significant disagreements between the inferred circular velocity and the observed molecular gas rotation speeds of ngc  3032 . assuming a constant dynamical @xmath70 within an effective radius , the circular velocity rises quickly to a peak of 330  at 0.08  and makes a sharp , nearly keplerian decline through the inner arcseconds .",
    "it drops by a factor of two to 157  at 5  and thereafter drops more slowly , passing through 132  at 10  which is nearly the edge of the molecular disk .",
    "but as figure [ n3032majax ] shows , these velocities are much larger than the observed co velocities especially interior to 5 .",
    "the strong radial gradient in the h@xmath5  absorption line strength index of ngc  3032 @xcite , and the young inferred central age @xcite suggest that the stellar population might be better described with a variable @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , if the line strength indices are interpreted with the models of @xcite and @xcite , the sauron data are consistent with a decline of a factor of two to three in the local stellar @xmath70 from 10  to 1 , even in the @xmath75 band ( from which the mge models are derived ) .",
    "moreover the inability of the self - consistent jeans model of section  [ vcirc ] to qualitatively reproduce the observed kinematics also indicates the need for a varying dynamical ( total ) @xmath70 .",
    "thus a second mge model was constructed , with a variable @xmath70 , such that the deprojected gaussian components having widths ( dispersions ) @xmath90 1  have",
    "m / l values half as large as the components with dispersions @xmath91 10 , and the variation is logarithmic between those extremes . using this mass model",
    "a non - self - consistent jeans model was computed and again fitted to the observed sauron stellar kinematics to derive a new @xmath70 .",
    "interestingly this revised jeans model , which has an @xmath70 gradient dictated by the stellar population measurements , now also well reproduces the observed sauron stellar kinematics .",
    "the inferred circular velocity curve has a somewhat smaller peak velocity , 285  at 0.08 , a steeper decline in the inner few arcseconds and a shallower slope at 10 , but its amplitude is the same at 10  ( 132 ) as for the model with the constant @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ 3032model2 ] shows the predicted co velocities that would have been observed if the molecular gas in ngc  3032 were rotating at the inferred circular velocity ( table [ 3032model ] ) . clearly the assumption of a variable",
    "m / l does not remove the discrepancy between observed and expected velocities .    ; red contours show a model position - velocity diagram in which the rotation velocity of each ring is the circular velocity ( blue line ) , assuming a decrease of a factor of two in the m / l interior to 10 .",
    "the green line shows a rotation curve @xmath92 which reproduces the observed gas velocities , as in table [ 3032model ] . [ 3032model2 ] ]    a reasonably accurate measure of the discrepancy between observed and expected velocities can be made from a model which describes the co velocities well .",
    "table [ 3032model ] and figure [ 3032model2 ] show the rotation velocities in this model ; they have been altered by hand to reproduce the observed position - velocity diagram .",
    "as before , no formal fitting has been done so the model shown can not be claimed unique or best and its gross properties should be trusted to a greater degree than its details .",
    "working \" model has a rotation velocity of 98  at 6.5  and 113  at 13.5 . at the outer edge of the co disk its velocity is only 10% smaller than that of the inferred circular velocity curve .",
    "however , at 6.5  ( 700 pc ) its rotation velocity is only 70% of the circular velocity curve , which means that the enclosed mass is a factor of two smaller than that suggested by the circular velocity .",
    "the discrepancy is even worse at smaller radii , where the circular velocity is nearly a factor of three higher than the rotation velocities in the molecular gas and the implied mass difference is a factor of 10 .",
    "lccc 1.5 & 183.6 & 88.7 & 1.0 + 2.7 & 166.1 & 89.8 & 0.9 + 3.6 & 155.3 & 90.9 & 0.8 + 4.5 & 148.8 & 92.0 & 0.7 + 5.5 & 144.5 & 93.2 & 0.6 + 6.5 & 141.4 & 97.6 & 0.5 + 7.5 & 138.7 & 101.0 & 0.4 + 8.7 & 135.7 & 106.3 & 0.3 + 10.0 & 132.4 & 108.8 & 0.2 + 11.6 & 129.1 & 111.0 & 0.1 + 13.5 & 126.1 & 113.3 & 0.0 +    at present the source of the discrepancy between the observed co velocities and the inferred circular velocity curve is not understood .",
    "the unusually strong peak in the circular velocity curve is driven by the very bright blue nucleus in optical images and by the high central stellar velocity dispersion . therefore , one possibility is that the measured stellar mean velocity and/or velocity dispersion in the center of ngc  3032 are significantly overestimated .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion measurements in the central regions made by @xcite with the oasis instrument are consistent with the sauron data .",
    "another striking possibility is that the molecular gas in ngc  3032 may not be rotating at the circular velocity .",
    "we argued above that the gas had to have been acquired from some external source , and perhaps it is still undergoing strong dynamical evolution as it settles into equilibrium . yet",
    "if its velocities are @xmath90 70% of the circular velocity its orbits would be highly noncircular , which seems inconsistent with the regular , symmetric appearance of the co velocity field ( figure [ n3032vel ] ) .",
    "neither of these explanations is completely satisfactory .    in short ,",
    "the co velocities in ngc  4459 and ngc  4526 are in excellent agreement with the circular velocities inferred for those two galaxies .",
    "these matches indicate that the stellar and co kinematics are well understood . in ngc  3032 and ngc  4150 at radii @xmath89 10 ,",
    "the observed co velocities are nearly equal to the mean stellar velocities and 10% to 20% smaller than the inferred circular velocities",
    ". however , the co velocities of ngc  3032 are conspicuously low when compared to its inferred circular velocity within 6  of the nucleus , and it would be valuable to carry out this kind of a comparison in other galaxies with counterrotating molecular gas in order to ascertain whether ngc  3032 is unusual .",
    "in normal spiral galaxies , the bulk of the ionized gas emission traces hii regions recently formed out of the molecular gas and sharing the disky kinematics of the molecular gas .",
    "the effect is that in a major axis position - velocity diagram the ionized gas tends to trace the ridgeline of the molecular and atomic gas or to be displaced towards the high velocity envelope ( due primarily to resolution effects ) .",
    "examples can be seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , comparisons between the molecular and ionized kinematics can help to elucidate the role of star formation activity ( or the lack thereof ) in producing the ionized gas .    excluding the case of ngc  4150 , which is discussed in [ 4150results ]",
    ", there appears to be a systematic difference between ionized gas kinematics and molecular kinematics of these lenticulars .",
    "the rotation speeds of the ionized gas are @xmath93 20% smaller than those of the co. there is also a slight tendency for the [ ]  velocities to be smaller than h@xmath5  velocities ; this latter feature is most obvious at radii @xmath65 5 in ngc  4526 ( figure [ n4526majax ] ) .",
    "lower velocities in the ionized gas than in the molecular gas is the opposite situation to what is usually observed in the disks of spirals and is also in the opposite sense to the effects of beam smearing on the co velocities .",
    "these data suggest that there may be a kinematic component of the ionized gas which is not dynamically cold and not related to star formation .",
    "they also imply that if the ionized gas in early - type galaxies is to be used for a measurement of the galaxy s circular velocity , an asymmetric drift correction may be significant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "by way of a caveat , though , we note that these lenticulars are dusty and ngc  4526 in particular has a high inclination ( 79 ) , so the observed co and ionized gas velocities may be biased by projection and optical depth effects .",
    "the details of the relationships between cold and warm ionized phases of the interstellar medium are not yet clear , and they deserve closer scrutiny for the insights they may give into the evolution of the ism in early - type galaxies .",
    "we present resolved images of the co emission in the four lenticular galaxies ngc  3032 , ngc  4150 , ngc  4459 , and ngc  4526 . these are some of the most co - rich galaxies in the sauron survey of early type galaxies , so they are prime targets for investigations which use cold gas to trace the interaction / merger history of early type galaxies and also to document morphological change through star formation and disk growth .",
    "their inferred  masses are in the range 5 to 5 .",
    "the molecular gas is located in kpc - scale disks ( in excellent agreement with the distribution of dust visible in broadband optical images ) , the smallest being ngc 4150 with a radius of 500 pc and the largest being ngc 3032 with a radius of 1.5 kpc .",
    "average molecular surface densities ( including helium ) are 100 to 200  pc@xmath0 .    in three of the four galaxies ( ngc 3032 , ngc 4459 , and ngc 4526 )",
    "the molecular gas is distributed in disks which show regular rotation and little sign of recent disturbance .",
    "the kinematic major axes are well aligned with the host galaxies photometric and ( stellar ) kinematic major axes , suggesting that the gas has settled into the equatorial plane of nearly axisymmetric potentials . the velocity field of ngc 4150 shows a kinematic major axis in rough agreement with the galaxy s optical major axis , but better spatial resolution will be necessary in order to assess the regularity of the co kinematics .",
    "furthermore , in ngc 3032 the molecular gas s kinematic position angle is 180  offset from the stellar kinematic position angle ; this dramatic counterrotation indicates that the molecular gas was acquired from an external source or perhaps is leftover from a major merger , but it can not have been produced through internal stellar mass loss .",
    "the sense of the co rotation in ngc  3032 is consistent with that of the young kinematically decoupled core , however , which suggests that this is an example of a stellar substructure forming through dissipational processes .    in two cases ( ngc 4459 and ngc 4526 )",
    "the co kinematics provide powerful , independent confirmation of the dynamical mass - to - light ratios inferred by @xcite .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios were derived from the sauron stellar kinematic data via two - integral jeans and three - integral schwarzschild dynamical models and were used to infer circular velocity curves .",
    "simple tilted ring models are presented in which the molecular gas rotates at the circular velocity ( or , in ngc 4526 , 95% of the circular velocity , a decrease which is roughly consistent with the uncertainty in the mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "comparison of the model and observed major axis position - velocity diagrams indicates that the circular velocity inferred from stellar kinematics alone is consistent with the behavior of the molecular gas .",
    "the agreement is significant because it is rare to be able to make this kind of an independent check of the stellar dynamical analysis .",
    "several puzzling results of this work deserve further study ; these are disagreements between the gaseous and the stellar kinematics at sub - kpc scales .",
    "for example , in ngc  4150 the co velocities appear to be inconsistent with those of the young ( counterrotating ) stellar core . in ngc 3032",
    "the observed co velocities are significantly lower than the circular velocity curve ( amounting to an implied factor of two less mass interior to 700 pc and even more at smaller radii ) . at present",
    "it is not known whether the stellar kinematic data give an overestimated circular velocity for this galaxy or whether the recently accreted molecular gas is not following circular orbits .",
    "higher resolution co observations will also be necessary to check whether ngc  4150 shows an inconsistency between co velocities and circular velocities .",
    "finally , the relationships between molecular gas and ionized gas should contribute valuable insights into star formation and the evolution of the ism in these lenticulars .",
