    "an emerging architecture for large - scale multiuser mimo communications is one where each base station ( bs ) is equipped with a large number of antennas and the user terminals are equipped with one antenna each . a key requirement on the uplink ( user terminal to bs link ) in such large - scale mimo systems is to achieve reduced channel estimation , detection and decoding complexities at the bs receiver to enable practical implementation , while maintaining good performance .",
    "when the number of bs antennas is much larger than the number of uplink users ( i.e. , low system loading factors ) , linear detectors like the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) detector are good in terms of both complexity and performance @xcite . in the recent years , several low complexity detection algorithms which achieve near - optimal performance in large dimensions using complexities comparable to that of mmse detection have been proposed @xcite,@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "these algorithms are based on local search ( e.g. , likelihood ascent search ( las ) algorithm and variants in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , meta - heuristics ( e.g. , reactive tabu search ( rts ) and variants in @xcite,@xcite ) , message passing techniques ( e.g. , belief propagation ( bp ) based algorithms in @xcite,@xcite ) , lattice reduction techniques ( e.g. , lattice reduction ( lr ) aided detectors in @xcite,@xcite ) , and monte - carlo sampling techniques ( e.g. , markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms in @xcite ) .",

    ". message passing algorithms can provide approximate marginalization of the joint distribution in ( [ map ] ) at low complexities . in section [ sec3 ] , we propose one such message passing algorithm , whose novelty lies in exploiting the channel hardening phenomenon that happens in large mimo channels . the channel hardening effect in large mimo channels",
    "is described in the following subsection .",
    "channel hardening refers to the phenomenon where the variance of the mutual information of the mimo channel grows very slowly relative to its mean or even shrink as the number of antennas grows @xcite .",
    "consider a @xmath40 mimo channel .",
    "as @xmath41 and @xmath42 are increased keeping their ratio fixed , the distribution of the singular values of the mimo channel matrix becomes less sensitive to the actual distribution of the entries of the channel matrix ( as long as the entries are i.i.d . )",
    "this is a result of the marenko - pastur law @xcite , which states that if the entries of a @xmath40 matrix @xmath43 are zero mean i.i.d . with variance @xmath44",
    ", then the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath45 converges almost surely , as @xmath46 with @xmath47 , to a density function @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 an effect of the marenko - pastur law is that very tall or very wide matrices are very well conditioned .",
    "the law also implies that the channel `` hardens '' , i.e. , the eigenvalue histogram of a single realization converges to the average asymptotic eigenvalue distribution .",
    "channel hardening can bring in several advantages in large dimensional signal processing .",
    "for example , linear detection in large systems will require inversion of large matrices .",
    "inversion of large random matrices can be done fast using series expansion techniques @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "because of channel hardening , approximate matrix inversions using series expansion and deterministic approximations from limiting distribution become effective in large dimensions .",
    "an interesting aspect in channel hardening is that as the size of @xmath43 increases , the off - diagonal terms of the @xmath45 matrix become increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms , i.e. , @xmath52 for @xmath46 with @xmath53 .",
    "this phenomenon is pictorially illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hardening ] , where we have plotted @xmath54 for the real - valued channel model in ( [ sys ] ) for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 channels . in proposing the new receiver algorithm in the next section",

    "in this section , we present the proposed chemp receiver .",
    "the proposed chemp receiver has two main components : @xmath60 a message passing based detection ( mpd ) algorithm , and @xmath61 a scheme to estimate @xmath5 .",
    "the proposed mpd algorithm works with the real - valued matched filtered received vector ( whose signal term becomes @xmath2 ) , and uses a gaussian approximation on the off - diagonal terms of the @xmath4 matrix .",
    "before we describe the proposed mpd algorithm , we state the following lemma which will be used in the development and analysis of the detection algorithm .",

    "the mean and variance in this approximation are given by @xmath95 denoting the probability of the symbol @xmath96 as @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 also , note that by lemma [ lemma1 ] , @xmath99 .",
    "because of the above gaussian approximation , the a posteriori probabilities of the transmitted symbols can be written as @xmath100 from ( [ probs ] ) , the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) of @xmath86 , denoted by @xmath101 , can be written as @xmath102 from ( [ llreq ] ) , @xmath103 , the probability of symbol @xmath86 , can be written as @xmath104        _ message passing : _ the system is modeled as a fully - connected graph , where the data symbols in @xmath87 represent the nodes .",

    "figure [ msgpass ] illustrates the above message passing schedule .",
    "note that the computation of the messages @xmath103 in ( [ pix ] ) requires the computation of ( [ musigma ] ) and ( [ llreq ] ) .",
    "the algorithm is initialized with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and message passing is carried out for a certain number of iterations , after which the algorithm stops .",
    "the values of @xmath103s at the end are taken as the soft values of @xmath86s .",
    "these soft values can be directly fed to the channel decoder in coded systems . in uncoded systems , a hard estimate of symbol",

    "the rate of convergence of this sequence @xmath111 can be improved by certain techniques .",

    "this method is also used in @xcite to accelerate the convergence of the gaussian belief propagation algorithm . by this method",
    ", a linearly converging sequence of real numbers can be accelerated to converge quadratically .",
    "although there is no rigorous proof guaranteeing this rate of convergence , empirical observations have shown that this method does accelerate the convergence of iterative algorithms . according to aitken s acceleration method",
    ", we define a sequence @xmath112 this new sequence @xmath113 converges faster than @xmath114 and to the same limit , whenever @xmath114 converges . after the first three iterations",
    ", @xmath115s can be used as the messages in the algorithm for faster convergence . *",
    "_ damping _ : damping of messages passed in message passing algorithms is a scheme known to improve the rate of convergence of iterative algorithms @xcite . at the @xmath16th iteration ,",
    "the message is damped by obtaining a convex combination of the message computed at the @xmath16th iteration and the message at the @xmath116th iteration , with a damping factor @xmath117 .",
    "thus , if @xmath118 is the computed probability at the @xmath16th iteration , the message at the end of @xmath16th iteration is @xmath119    in section [ sec3d ] , we will see the performance of these methods in improving the rate of convergence and the optimal choice for @xmath120 .",
    "a listing of the proposed mpd algorithm with damping is given in * algorithm [ mpmdalgo]*.    : @xmath121 , @xmath122      the computational complexity of the mpd algorithm is as follows .",
    "the complexity ( in number of real operations ) required to compute ( [ musigma ] ) and ( [ pix ] ) is of order @xmath123 .",
    "the complexities of computing @xmath82 and @xmath85 are of orders @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "so , the total complexity of the proposed mpd is @xmath125 , which is attractive for large - scale mimo systems .    in table",

    "[ comp1 ] , the following interesting observations can be made :",
    "1 ) for large @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xmath127 ) , mpd complexity is less than mmse complexity .",

    "the mpd complexity is almost the same as ( marginally higher than ) mmse complexity , because the number of iterations ( @xmath131 ) is comparable with @xmath6 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "also , mpd performs better than mmse detection , and achieves close to optimal detection performance for large @xmath133 , and different system loading factors .",
