    "there has been a lot of interest in recent years in the dynamics of interacting brownian particles @xcite .",
    "the reason for this interest is twofold .",
    "first , experiments have provided a wealth of information about the motion of individual colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "a system of interacting brownian particles is the simplest model of a colloidal suspension .",
    "second , interacting brownian particles constitute the simplest model system on which one can test techniques and approximations of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "it is a simpler model system than a simple fluid for both fundamental reasons ( irreversibility is built in ) and technical reasons ( particles have fewer degrees of freedom due to the overdamped character of their motion )",
    ".    in this paper we present a diagrammatic approach to the description of time - dependent density fluctuations in equilibrium systems of interacting brownian particles ( here an equilibrium system means a stable or a metastable ( _ e.g. _ supercooled ) equilibrium system ) . the original inspiration for this work was a series of three papers @xcite by hans andersen in which a general framework of a diagrammatic approach to the dynamics of fluctuations in equilibrium simple fluids was presented . an important feature of andersen s approach was adoption of a specific set of basis functions , termed boley @xcite basis . as lucidly explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the advantages of this set of basis functions is an enormous simplification of the initial condition for the whole hierarchy of equations for time - dependent correlation functions @xcite .",
    "additional motivation for our work comes from renewed interest @xcite in developing field theories for systems of strongly interacting particles and in using these theories to generate approximate self - consistent approaches to the dynamics of these systems .",
    "such field theories usually lead to diagrammatic series for so - called response and correlation functions .",
    "our work might be the first step in a reverse procedure : constructing a field theory from a diagrammatic approach .",
    "also , our approach provides a very simple derivation of the mode - coupling theory @xcite that has been extensively used to describe colloidal systems .",
    "this theory has been previously derived using a projection operator approach @xcite .",
    "more recent , field - theoretical derivations have either been found unsatisfactory @xcite or are quite involved @xcite .",
    "finally , new techniques have recently been developed for strongly correlated many - body quantum systems that allow one to numerically integrate @xcite and approximately analyze @xcite whole diagrammatic series .",
    "it is hoped that these methods could be adopted to classical many - body systems and , in particular , that they could be used to evaluate diagrammatic series presented in this paper .",
    "our diagrammatic approach to the dynamics of equilibrium systems of interacting brownian particles is similar to that developed by andersen @xcite for simple fluids . in spite of the fact that a brownian system is simpler than a simple fluid , in the present problem it is advantageous to introduce two different sets of basis functions . as a consequence , a general structure that leads to",
    "the emergence of so - called irreducible memory function appears naturally in the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "our approach uses one important aspect of andersen s work : in ref .",
    "@xcite the existence of a basis of orthogonalized many - particle phase - space density fluctuations was established .",
    "we use a consequence of this result : we assume the existence of a basis consisting of orthogonalized many - particle density fluctuations in the fourier space .",
    "we also assume the existence of a second , closely - related orthogonalized basis of many - particle self - density fluctuations in the fourier space .",
    "the latter basis was used previously in the description of self - diffusion in brownian systems @xcite .",
    "our main , formal result is a hierarchy of equations for time - dependent correlations of the orthogonalized many - particle densities .",
    "an important feature of this hierarchy is that all the interactions are renormalized : they are expressed in terms of equilibrium correlation functions . to simplify the structure of the hierarchy",
    ", we neglect the contributions to the terms describing inter - particle interactions ( _ i.e. _ vertices ) coming from higher - order cluster expansion terms .",
    "an iterative solution of the simplified hierarchy can be interpreted in terms of diagrams . after some simplifications we obtain an expansion in terms of diagrams consisting of lines corresponding to free diffusion and three- , and four - leg vertices .",
    "we analyze the structure of the diagrammatic expression for the density correlation function and show that so - called irreducible memory function appears in a very natural way .",
    "finally , we present a diagrammatic derivation of the standard , gtze - like @xcite mode - coupling approximation .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ basis ] , we introduce two sets of basis functions . in sec .",
    "[ eofm ] , we derive exact , formal equations of motion for time - dependent correlations of orthogonalized many - particle densities and in sec .",

    "[ mf ] , we analyze the series expansion and present diagrammatic expressions for so - called memory and irreducible memory functions . in sec .",
    "[ mct ] , we show that a self - consistent one - loop approximation for the irreducible memory function is equivalent to the mode - coupling approximation .",
    "we close in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] with a discussion of our results , a comparison with other approaches , and an outline of future research .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 interacting brownian particles in volume @xmath1 .",

    "the orthogonalized densities are symmetric functions of their arguments .",
    "the set of the orthogonalized densities constitutes the boley @xcite basis for the present problem .",
    "it should be emphasized that the orthogonalization procedure described above implicitly assumes the existence of the projection operators @xcite .",

    "the only , minor difference is that the functions considered in this work are fourier transforms of the many - particle densities in position space whereas the functions considered in ref .",

    "furthermore , one integrates over all intermediate times , and divides the result by a product of factorials that follow from factorials appearing in hierarchy ( [ notsoexactinteq1]-[notsoexactinteq2 ] ) .",

    "it is very important to note that labeled diagrams that occur in the series expansion generated by the iterative solution of hierarchy ( [ notsoexactinteq1]-[notsoexactinteq2 ] ) differ by a permutation of labels pertaining to the same `` time slice '' .",
    "for example , out of three diagrams showed in fig .",
    "[ f : counting ] only the top two ones enter in the series expansion and including also the third one would lead to over - counting .",

    "-[notsoexactinteq2 ] ) for a given sequence of wavevectors , only those topologically different diagrams that differ by permutations of wavevector labels pertaining to the same `` time slice '' are allowed .",
    "thus , the top diagrams should be included whereas the bottom one should not . ]",
    "summarizing , we obtain the following diagrammatic representation of the response function : @xmath199    next , we introduce unlabeled diagrams",
    ". bonds in these diagrams , except for the left root , are not labeled .",
    "two unlabeled diagrams are topologically equivalent if there is a way to assign labels to unlabeled bonds so that the resulting labeled diagrams are topologically equivalent .",
    "to evaluate an unlabeled diagram one assigns labels to unlabeled bonds , evaluates the resulting labeled diagram , and then divides the result by a symmetry number of the diagram ( _ i.e. _ the number of topologically identical labeled diagrams that can be obtained from a given unlabeled diagram by permutation of the bond labels ) .",
    "it should be appreciated that each unlabeled diagram represents a number of original , labeled diagrams .",
    "for example , the labeled diagram showed in fig .",
    "[ f : labelunlabel ] and another 23 similar labeled diagrams ( _ i.e. _ 24 diagrams altogether ) are represented by one unlabeled diagram .    . ]",
    "it can be showed that the diagrammatic series ( [ gseries0 ] ) can be replaced by a series of topologically different unlabeled diagrams . to prove this fact one has to follow the proof of an analogous transformation from a series of labeled mayer diagrams to a series of unlabeled ones @xcite .",
    "the unlabeled diagrams can be simplified .",
    "this can be illustrated on the example of the diagram showed above .",
    "the value of this diagram is given by the following expression : @xmath200 to simplify this formula we first integrate over @xmath175 functions .",
    "then , since @xmath201 and @xmath202 , we can rewrite ( [ diag21 ] ) in the following form @xmath203 one should note that in the above expression additional @xmath193 functions originating from simplifying products of bare response functions have been incorporated into the remaining bare response functions .",

    "we can , however , sum all such diagrams and obtain a time - unordered diagram for which there is no restriction on the ordering of times associated with different vertices ( note that there is always an implicit restriction due to vanishing of response functions for @xmath206 and thus in the above example @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) . as a result",
    "we obtain a series involving so - called time - unordered diagrams .",
    "one should note that both integrating over @xmath175 functions and replacing sums of time - ordered diagrams by time - unordered ones do not change the symmetry numbers of diagrams . in the following",
    "we implicitly assume that these transformations have been performed on all diagrams .",
    "thus , from now on , we will consider time - unordered diagrams without @xmath209 vertices .    the final result of this section is the following diagrammatic expression for the response function : @xmath210",

    "we note that the diagrams contributing to the self - energy start with @xmath195 vertex on the right and end with @xmath194 vertex on the left . customarily , to define the memory function for a brownian system one factors out parts of these vertices .",

    "f : mirr ] ) but with @xmath222 bonds replaced by @xmath246 bonds , see fig . [ f : mct ] .",
    "and @xmath234 vertices leads to a one - loop diagram with @xmath246 bonds . ]    as a result of this re - summation we get one - loop self - consistent approximation for the memory matrix , @xmath247 the factor 2 in the denominator is the symmetry number of the single - loop diagram .    using explicit expressions ( [ v12c]-[v21c ] ) for the cut - out vertices we easily show that ( [ mmct ] ) leads to the following expression for the irreducible memory function @xmath248 as indicated above , the one - loop self - consistent approximation coincides with the mode - coupling approximation , _ i.e. _ both approximations result in exactly the same expression for the irreducible memory function .",
    "expression ( [ mmctexplicit ] ) was first derived using a projection operator approach @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was also derived using a field theory version @xcite of a dynamic density functional theory of kawasaki @xcite .",
    "later , it was noticed @xcite that the latter derivation was incompatible with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "recently , there appeared two new field - theoretical derivations of the mode - coupling theory for brownian systems @xcite .",
    "only one of these derivations @xcite leads to expression ( [ mmctexplicit ] ) that was originally derived using projection operator method .",
    "the other derivation @xcite results in a equation that has the same structure as ( [ mmctexplicit ] ) but involves different vertices .",
    "we have presented a diagrammatic formulation of a theory for the time dependence of density fluctuations in equilibrium systems of interacting brownian particles . we have analyzed the series expansion for the time - dependent response function and have obtained diagrammatic expressions for both the memory function and the irreducible memory function .",
    "the one - loop self - consistent approximation for the latter function coincides with the mode - coupling expression derived via the projection operator method .    to derive a diagrammatic expansion for the time - dependent response function we have neglected contributions to the vertices from higher - order terms in the cluster expansion .",
    "it should be noticed that in spite of this fact we obtained the same mode - coupling expression as the one derived using the projection operator method .",
    "this suggests that the diagrammatic series ( [ gseries ] ) contains all the dynamical events that result in the standard mode - coupling approximation",
    ". it would be interesting to use series ( [ gseries ] ) as a starting point for the development of theories that go beyond the standard mode - coupling approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ to include at least some classes of the diagrams that are neglected in the one - loop re - summation .",
    "also , it would be interesting to investigate diagrammatic interpretation of so - called generalized mode - coupling theories @xcite .",
    "finally , the formalism presented here could be used to derive an approximate theory for the time - dependence of various four - point correlation functions .",
    "such functions have been extensively studied in the last decade @xcite .",
    "they provide quantitative information about so - called dynamic heterogeneity or , more precisely , about correlations of dynamics of different particles .",
    "one of the consequences of neglecting the contributions to the vertices from higher - order terms in the cluster expansion is that the approximate equations of motion ( [ notsoexacthierarchy2]-[notsoexacthierarchy2a ] ) do not reproduce the exact short - time behavior of the density correlation function .",
    "in addition , as noted by andersen @xcite , on physical grounds one would expect that in the mode - coupling formula ( [ mmct ] ) the vertices are replaced by matrix elements of a binary collision operator .",
    "we plan to rectify these two drawbacks of the present approach in future work .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that it leads to a relatively simple diagrammatic series .",
    "thus , it should be possible to derive a field theoretical representation of this series .",
    "we note , however , that our diagrammatic series is different from series expansions that have been derived from various field theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "first , our series involves one dynamical function whereas field - theoretical expansions are typically formulated in terms of two functions , a correlation function and a response function ( that is different from the response function used in our formalism ) .",
    "in addition , series ( [ gseries ] ) involves both three- and four - leg vertices whereas series expansions resulting from field theoretical approaches typically involve only three - leg vertices .",
    "finally , in our series the renormalization of bare interactions occurs naturally . in field",
    "theoretical approaches one either carries bare interactions throughout or one has to start from a phenomenological formulation of dynamics that involves the direct correlation function .",
