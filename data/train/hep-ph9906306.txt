    "diffractive scattering was imported into high energy strong interaction to interpret the @xmath1 distribution of elastic hadron - hadron scattering at small @xmath2 region @xcite . in the framework of the regge theory ,",
    "diffractive scattering is assumed to take place through the exchange of an object with the quantum numbers of the vacuum ( the pomeron ) @xcite , although , the pomeron plays a particular and very important role in soft processes in hadron - hadron collisions , the true nature of it and its interaction with hadrons remain a mystery .    due to the nature of color singlet exchange ,",
    "the diffractive scattering events are characterized by a large rapidity gap , a region in rapidity devoiding of hadronic energy flow .",
    "events containing rapidity gap and jets were first observed by ua8 collaboration at cern @xcite , opening the field of hard diffraction . the hard diffraction is also observed and studied by various experiments @xcite .",
    "although it is still difficult to understand the soft diffractive scattering in the framework of qcd , much progresses in understanding the nature of hard diffraction are made in the light of great theoritical and experimental efforts @xcite . as an attempt of understanding hard diffraction on the parton level , ingelman and",
    "schlein @xcite assumed that the pomeron , similar to the nucleon , is composed of partons , mainly of gluons , and the hard diffractive processes can probe the partonic structure of the pomeron .",
    "in fact , the ingelman - schlein model for hard diffraction is based on the assumption of hard diffractive scattering factorization together with regge factorization for the pomeron exchange .",
    "but , comparison the total @xmath3 single diffraction cross section data @xcite with predictions based on the regge factorization for the pomeron exchange indicates the breakdown of the regge factorization @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as pointed by ingelman in @xcite , there are conceptual and theoretical problems with the ingelmal - schlein model .",
    "first , the pomeron is not a real state , it is only a virtual exchanged spacelike object .",
    "the concept of a structure function is then not well defined .",
    "in fact , the factorization of diffractive structure function into a pomeron flux and a pomeron structure function can not be uniquely defined since only the product is an observable quantity .",
    "second , the pomeron - proton interaction is soft , its space - time scale is larger compared to that of the hard interaction , so the pomeron can then not be considered as decoupled from the proton , and in particular , is not a separate part of the qcd evolution in the proton .    for the lepton induced hard diffractive scattering processes , such as diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) and diffractive direct photoproduction of jets , there is indeed a factorization theorem which has been proven by collins @xcite recently .",
    "it is the same as factorization for inclusive hard processed , except that parton densities are replaced by diffractive parton densities @xcite .",
    "the diffractive parton densities ( the primary non - perturbative quantities in hard diffraction ) obey exactly the same dglap evolution equations as ordinary parton densities , and have been extracted from hera data on ddis and on diffractive photonproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "this factorization theorem also establishes the universality of the diffractive parton distrubutions for those processes to which the theorem applies , hence justifies , from fundamental principles , the analysis of zeus and h1 collaboration @xcite on hard diffraction , provided the term `` pomeron '' used in these analyses is as a label for a particular kind of parametrization for diffractive parton densities , and an indication of the vacuum quantum numbers to be exchanged . in the light of hard diffractive factorization proven by collins @xcite , the ingelman - schlein model for hard diffraction",
    "assumed further the factorization of diffractive parton densities into a universal pomeron flux and a pomeron parton densities , but such further factorization is unjustifiable .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of another hard diffractive process , @xmath0 diffractive production in the direct photon process at hera [ proc ] ( q ) + p(p_1 ) p(p_1^ ) + ( p ) + jet + x ,    where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the momenta of incoming photon , proton , outgoing proton , and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "we base on the factorization theorem for lepton - induced hard diffractive scattering and the factorization formalism of the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) for quarkonia production . using the diffractive gluon distribution function extracted from hera data on ddis and diffractive dijet photon production ,",
    "we show that this process can give valuable insights in the color - octet mechanism for heavy quarkonia production .",
    "this process was briefly discussed in @xcite where the relativistic corrections to photoproduction of @xmath6 were studied in the so - called color - singlet model ( csm)@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in detail our calculation scheme in sec.ii , in which , a brief introduction of the heavy quarkonium production mechanism , the hard subprocesses for @xmath7 production and a summary of the kinematics related to the @xmath6 s @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributiones are included .",
    "our results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "based on the factorization theorem for lepton - induced hard diffractive scattering and the factorization formalism of nrqcd for heavy quarkonia production , @xmath7 diffractive production process is shown in fig.1 .",
    "this process consists two steps .",
    "first , the almost point - like @xmath10 pair with large @xmath9 is produced in the hard subprocesses , then @xmath11 particle is produced from this point - like @xmath10 pair via soft interactions .",
    "heavy quarkonium production in various processes has been the focus of much experimental and theoretical attention during the past few years @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the observation of large disrepancies between experiment measurements of prompt and direct @xmath6 production and @xmath12 production at large @xmath9 at the collider detector facility ( cdf ) at the fermilab tevatron and the calculations based on cms @xcite .",
    "the first major conceptual advance in heavy quarkonium production was the realization that fragmentation dominates at sufficiently large @xmath9 @xcite which indicates that most charmonium at large @xmath9 is produced by the fragmentation of individual large @xmath9 partons .",
    "the fragmentation functions are calculated in csm . including this fragmentation mechanism indeed brings the theoretical predictions for prompt @xmath6 production at the tevatron to within a factor of 3 of the data @xcite .",
    "but the prediction for the @xmath13 production cross section remains a factor of 30 below the data even after including the fragmentation contribution ( the @xmath14``surplus '' problem ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the logarithmic infrared divergences in the production cross sctions for p - wave charmonium states and the annihilation rate for @xmath15 indicate csm is incomplete .",
    "all these indicate that important production mechanism beyond csm needs to be included @xcite@xcite .",
    "so the color - octet mechanism @xcite is proposed which is based on the factorization formalism of nrqcd @xcite@xcite .",
    "contrary to the basic assumption of csm , the heavy quark pair in a color - octet state can make a transition into physical quarkonium state through soft color interactions .    although the color - octet fragmentation picture of heavy quarkonium production @xcite has provided valuable insight , the approximation that enter into fragmentation computations break down when a quarkonium s energy becomes comparable to its mass .",
    "the fragmentation predictions for heavy quarkonium production are therefore unrealiable at low @xmath9 . based upon the above several recently developed ideas in heavy quarkonium physics , cho and leibovich@xcite identify a large class of color - octet diagrams that mediate quarkonia production at all energies , which reduce to the dominant set of gluon fragmentation graphs in the high @xmath9 limit . by fitting the data on heavy quarkonia production at the tevatron , numerical values for the long distance matrix elements are extracted@xcite , which are generally consistent with nrqcd power scaling rules @xcite .    in order to convincingly establish the color - octet machanism , it is important to test whether the same matrix elements be able to explain heavy quarkonium production in other high energy processes , such as inclusive @xmath6 production in @xmath16 annihilation and inelastic @xmath17 photoproduction at hera _",
    "et al . _ .",
    "other machanism for heavy quarkonium production can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 is described within the nrqcd framework in terms of fock state decompositions as |&= & o(1 )   |c|c[^3s_1^(1 ) ] + o(v )    & & + o(v^2 ) |c|c[^1s_0^(8 ) ] g + o(v^2 ) |c|c[^3s_1^(1,8 ) ] g g + & & + o(v^2 ) |c|c[^3p_j^(1,8 ) ] g g+ , where the @xmath10 pairs are indicated within the square brackets in spectroscopic notation .",
    "the pairs color states are indicate by singlet ( 1 ) or octet ( 8) superscripts .",
    "the color octet @xmath10 state can make a transition into a physical @xmath6 state by soft chromoelectric dipole ( e1 ) transition(s ) or chromomagnitic dipole m1 transition(s ) ( c |c)[^2s + 1l_j^(8 ) ] .",
    "nrqcd factorization scheme @xcite has been established to systematically separate high and low energy scale interactions .",
    "it is based upon a bouble power series expansion in the strong interaction fine structure constant @xmath18 and the small velocity parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the production of a @xmath20 $ ] pair with separation less than or of order @xmath21 can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the long distance effects for the produced almost point - like @xmath10 to form the bound state are isolated into nonperturbative matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , nrqcd power counting rules can be exploited to determine the dominant contributions to various quarkonium processes@xcite . for direct @xmath17 production , the color - octet matrix elements , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are all scaling as @xmath24 .",
    "so these color - octet contributions to @xmath17 production must be included for consistency .    on the partonic level , @xmath0 production",
    "are composed of the photon gluon fusion , which are sketched in fig.2 .",

    "the quark initiated subprocesses(@xmath25 channel ) are strongly suppressed and will be neglected further .",
    "the color su(3 ) coefficients are given by 3i;|3j | 1 = _",
    "ji/ ,   3i;|3j | 8a = t^a_ji .",
