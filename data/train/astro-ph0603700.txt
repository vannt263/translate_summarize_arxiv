    "from the days of the great comet - hunter charles messier up to well into the 20th century , ngc205 was the only known member of the class of objects that we now call dwarf ellipticals ( des ) @xcite . des are faint ( @xmath4  mag ) galaxies with diffuse , approximately exponentially declining surface brightness profiles and smooth elliptical isophotes @xcite .",
    "ngc205 was resolved into stars and thus confirmed as a local - group member by walter baade , using the 100  inch telescope at mount wilson observatory @xcite .",
    "he correctly identified ngc205 , at a projected distance of only 37 from m31 , as a diffuse stellar system with a stellar population very much like that of the galactic globular clusters . ngc147 and",
    "ngc185 form a close pair , separated by only 58 on the sky @xcite and located some 7@xmath5 away from m31 .",
    "baade confirmed ngc147 and ngc185 as members of the local group by resolving them into individual stars @xcite .",
    "no new local group des have been discovered since then while the sensus of the local group dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) , which are even fainter ( absolute b - band magnitude @xmath6  mag ) and more diffuse than des , is most likely not yet complete . since baade",
    "could resolve these dwarf galaxies at about the same magnitude as m31 , he surmised that they should be at roughly the same distance as m31 .",
    "more precise distance measurements have since then clarified the geometry of the m31 satellite galaxy system . using the trgb distances measured by mcconnachie , @xmath7  kpc , @xmath8  kpc , @xmath9  kpc , @xmath10  kpc , which are in good agreement with those presented by lee et al . and lee , and the angular distances between the galaxies , the following picture emerges . using the distance moduli and the sources of photometric errors given by mcconnachie et al .",
    ", we find that ngc147 and ngc185 are separated by @xmath11  kpc and the couple is situated 160  kpc in front of m31 . for all practical purposes ,",
    "we can therefore treat them as isolated stellar systems .",
    "ngc205 , on the other hand , is situated @xmath12  kpc behind m31 .    in this paper",
    ", we present dynamical models for ngc147 , ngc185 , and ngc205 . in order to construct a mass model for the luminous matter ,",
    "we use 2mass j - band images of these galaxies , downloaded from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive website .",
    "these dwarf galaxies have complex star - formation histories and show evidence for spatial variations of the stellar population , the most striking being the very blue nucleus of ngc205 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the density distribution obtained from near - infrared j - band images should trace the mass distribution of the luminous matter more closely than that obtained from optical images .",
    "we measured the surface - brightness profile , position angle , and ellipticity @xmath13 of all three galaxies as a function of the geometric mean of major and minor axis distance , denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "these were obtained using our own software .",
    "basically , the code fits an ellipse through a set of positions where a given surface brightness level is reached .",
    "the shape of an isophote , relative to the best fitting ellipse with semi - major axis a and ellipticity @xmath16 , is quantified by expanding the intensity variation along this ellipse in a fourth order fourier series with coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 is the average intensity of the isophote and the angle @xmath23 is measured from the major axis . using all photometric parameters , evaluated as a function of @xmath14 , a smooth image of each galaxy is reconstructed .",
    "we used this smooth image to measure the total j - band magnitude and half - light radii . in each case , the total apparent magnitude we derive is within 0.05  mag of that listed in the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite . as to the half - light radii , we find for ngc205 that @xmath24 ( 0.52  kpc ) , for ngc147 that @xmath25 ( 0.38  kpc ) , and ngc185 that @xmath26 ( 0.27  kpc ) .",
    "this smooth image is then deprojected in order to obtain the spatial density distribution of the stars .",
    "the spatial density of an axisymmetric stellar system can not uniquely be reconstructed from the observed projected density if it is not viewed edge - on @xcite . from the infinity of equally plausible positive , axially symmetric spatial densities that project to",
    "the observed projected density , we pick the one that can be represented as a weighted sum of basis functions , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 of the form @xmath29.\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 is a scale radius , @xmath31 is a shape parameter , making the density profile more ( small @xmath31 ) or less ( large @xmath31 ) centrally concentrated , @xmath32 is the axis - ratio , controlling the flattening of the basis function .",
    "these basis functions produce elliptical isophotes when projected onto the sky . for a given inclination ,",
    "the unknown coefficients in the expansion of the spatial density are determined by fitting the projected basis functions to the observed photometry , evaluated on an elliptical , logarithmically spaced grid subject to the constraint that the spatial density is positive everywhere using a quadratic programming algorithm @xcite .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath33 can be negative , as long as the weighted sum of basis functions is positive .",
    "this algorithm has a library at its disposal that contains hundreds of basis functions to choose from .",
    "typically , the @xmath34 does not further improve after co - adding a few tens of components and the procedure can be stopped .",
    "this deprojection procedure ensures that the spatial density is smooth , well - behaved , and positive .",
    "already from the 2mass image , it is obvious that ngc205 is noticeably influenced by the tidal forces exerted by m31 ( see fig .",
    "[ phot205 ] ) . beyond a major - axis distance of @xmath35 the isophotes of ngc205 twist from a position angle of 167@xmath5 to 160@xmath5 at 400 . at that radius",
    ", the surface brightness profile also shows a downward break , as can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ kin205 ] ( see also hodge and choi et al . ) . in these outer regions , peculiar kinematics , such as the outermost stars moving counter to the rotation of the main body @xcite ,",
    "provide further evidence for a tidal interaction with m31 .",
    "we will therefore check if our results for ngc205 are affected by it being so close to m31 .",
    "the isophotes of ngc147 and ngc185 are much more regular , with negligible isophote twisting , see figs .",
    "[ phot147 ] and [ phot185 ] .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the 1.93-m telescope of the observatoire de haute - provence , equipped with the carelec long - slit spectrograph . in combination with a eev receptor with @xmath36 pixels of @xmath37 m ,",
    "the instrumental velocity dispersion was @xmath38  km  s@xmath39 ( r=5050 ) for a slit width of 1.5 .",
    "more details and a log of the observations can be found in simien & prugniel .",
    "10-minute exposures on blank fields of sky obtained during the same night as the science exposures were used for sky subtraction . with a fourier - fitting technique @xcite , the spectrum of a g8iii template star ( hd5395 ) , convolved with a gaussian line - of - sight velocity distribution , yielded a good fit to the galaxy spectrum in fourier space , providing a simultaneous estimate of the mean streaming velocity @xmath40 and the projected velocity dispersion @xmath41 .    from the deep major axis spectrum of ngc205 , stellar kinematics out to about 300 ( 1.2  kpc or 2.3 half - light radii ) could be extracted .",
    "the minor axis spectra yields useful kinematic information out to 120 ( 0.9  kpc ) .",
    "thanks to the proximity of this galaxy and the unprecedented depth of the spectra , we can measure kinematics near the center of ngc205 with a spatial resolution of @xmath42  parsecs .",
    "the major axis spectrum of ngc185 allows extracting kinematics out to @xmath43 ( 0.3  kpc or 1.1  @xmath44 ) .",
    "ngc147 has the lowest surface brightness of all local group des and is moreover riddled with foreground stars and was therefore the most difficult object to obtain decent kinematics for .",
    "the spectra of ngc147 secured by simien & prugniel turned out to be insufficiently deep .",
    "we , therefore , re - observed ngc147 in january 2002 and january 2003 , using the same instrumental setup and the same data reduction procedure . with the addition of these new exposures ( six one - hour exposures along the southern semi - major axis and four one - hour exposures along the northern semi - major axis ) ,",
    "the major - axis kinematics of ngc147 now extend out to @xmath45 ( 0.5  kpc or 1.2  @xmath0 ) along the northern semi - major axis and out to @xmath46 ( 0.3  kpc or 0.8  @xmath0 ) along the southern semi - major axis .",
    "the details of the modeling method are given in section [ 3int ] .",
    "we present the results for each of the galaxies in sect .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "the internal dynamics of a steady - state oblate stellar system are described by a gravitational potential @xmath47 , that determines the stellar orbits , and the distribution function ( df ) @xmath48 , which gives the number density of stars in phase space ( @xmath49 are cylindrical coordinates in each meridional plane ) .",
    "loosely speaking , the df distributes the stars over all possible orbits in a given potential . in the following",
    ", we will work in prolate elliptical coordinates @xmath50 ) @xcite , defined by @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath53 are confocal prolate spheroids ; surfaces defined by constant @xmath54 are confocal two - sheeted hyperboloids , both with foci at @xmath55 .",
    "we will approximate the gravitational potential by a stckel potential , of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 the potential in the equatorial plane .",
    "such potentials allow the existence of three integrals of motion : the binding energy @xmath58 , the @xmath59-component of the angular moment @xmath60 , which we use in the more convenient form @xmath61 , and @xmath62 an integral which is a generalisation of angular momentum conservation in spherical systems .",
    "roughly , for a given @xmath58 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 determines how high above the equatorial plane an orbit will come .",
    "models that make use of the third integral are called three - integral or 3i models , versus two - integral or 2i models that go without it .",
    "a detailed account of the method we employed to construct the spheroidal coordinate system and stckel potential that give the best fit to a given axisymmetric potential can be found in dejonghe & de zeeuw , dejonghe et al . , and in de bruyne et al . .",
    "in brief , we deproject the observed surface brightness distribution , derived from a 2mass @xmath65-band image , assuming the galaxy to be axisymmetric .",
    "since ngc147 and ngc205 have a fairly flattened apparent shape , with an apparent axial ratio @xmath66 , it is quite unlikely that they are viewed far from edge - on . the intrinsic flattening distribution of des peaks around an intrinsic axial ratio @xmath67 while galaxies with an intrinsic axial ratio smaller than @xmath68 are virtually absent @xcite .",
    "assuming both galaxies to have an oblate , axissymetric light distribution that is intrinsically rounder than a @xmath68 shape , the inclination is expected to be larger than @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we can assume for simplicity that ngc147 and ngc205 are viewed edge - on without significantly affecting any of the results .",
    "ngc185 , on the other hand , has a much rounder apparent shape , with an apparent axial ratio @xmath70 .",
    "if we assume that the galaxy has an intrinsic shape that is rounder than @xmath68 , the inclination is expected to be larger than @xmath71 . in order to assess the influence of the intrinsic shape and the viewing angle of ngc185 on our results",
    ", we generated models with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "however , with kinematics along the major axis only and lacking higher - order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution , the kinematical data do not allow to constrain the inclination with any degree of precision .    the total mass density , including dark matter , is parameterized as the spatial luminous mass density multiplied by a spatially varying mass - to - light ratio @xmath77 with the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 to be estimated from the data and @xmath32 the axis ratio of the luminosity density distribution .",
    "attempts to find intermediate - mass black holes in des , using either ground - based kinematics @xcite or high spatial resolution kinematical information obtained with hst @xcite , have sofar failed . for this reason , and since we are mostly interested in the total dark - matter content of these galaxies , we did not include a central black hole in our models .",
    "the gravitational potential is obtained by decomposing the total mass density in spherical harmonics . finally , we determine the stckel potential , i.e. the focal length @xmath80 and the function @xmath81 , that best fits this gravitational potential .",
    "the stckel form of the potential is used only to calculate the third integral @xmath64 ; elsewhere the potential derived from spherical harmonics is used .",
    "the potential is normalised such that @xmath82 at large radius @xmath83 , with @xmath83 expressed in kiloparsecs .    for a given potential",
    ", we wish to find the df that best reproduces the kinematical information . as a first step ,",
    "the df is written as a weighted sum of basis functions , called `` components '' . here",
    ", we will use components of the form @xmath84 with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 integer numbers .",
    "@xmath88 is a lower bound on the binding energy , which defines the outer boundary within which the component is non - zero .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 indicates whether stars are placed only on orbits with positive angular momentum ( @xmath90 ) or only on orbits with negative angular momentum ( @xmath91 ) or on both ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix [ app ] for a discussion of the properties of these components .",
    "the df then takes the form @xmath93 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath94 are determined by minimizing the quantity @xmath95 with @xmath96 an observed data point , @xmath97 the 1-@xmath98 errorbar on that data point , and @xmath99 the corresponding value calculated from the basis function @xmath100 , subject to the constraint that the df be positive everywhere in phase space . note that the coefficients @xmath101 can be negative , as long as the weighted sum of basis functions is positive .",
    "the projected velocity moments , @xmath102 can be obtained by integrating suitably weighted combinations of the spatial velocity moments over a line of sight in a direction @xmath103 : @xmath104 with @xmath40 the line - of - sight velocity and @xmath105 a coordinate along the line of sight . from the observed quantities , the projected luminosity density @xmath106 with @xmath107 the observed surface brightness expressed in magnitude  arcsec@xmath108 , the mean projected velocity @xmath40 , and the projected velocity dispersion @xmath41 ,",
    "one can easily construct observed values for the lowest - order velocity moments @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 along each observed line of sight and insert these values into eqn .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) , which is minimized using a quadratic programming algorithm @xcite .",
    "the minimisation algorithm has a library at its disposal that contains hundreds of components to choose from .",
    "since the algorithm itself determines which and how many components are used , this is a virtually non - parametric method of retrieving the distribution function .",
    "typically , the @xmath34 does not further improve after co - adding a few tens of components and the procedure can be stopped .",
    "this finally yields the coefficients @xmath101 and consequently the distribution function that best reproduces the data for a given gravitational potential .",
    "if the basis functions @xmath100 are smooth and well - behaved functions of the integrals of motion , any combination of a finite number of basis functions will by construction also be smooth and well - behaved in phase space .",
    "it is well known that in a spherical geometry even complete kinematical knowledge does not suffice to uniquely constrain both the gravitational potential and the distribution function . on the contrary : for each potential , there is a unique distribution function that reproduces the data @xcite .",
    "that distribution function , however , need not be positive everywhere in phase - space .",
    "the positivity constraint we are imposing on the distribution function therefore helps to constrain the gravitational potential .",
    "the degeneracy in the general axisymmetric case , however , can be expected to be a lot smaller than in the spherical case . for 2i models ,",
    "the even part of the distribution function can be derived directly from the augmented stellar density @xmath112 which , in the absence of dark matter , can in principle be constructed directly by deprojecting the observed surface brightness distribution .",
    "this is clearly not possible in the spherical case .",
    "therefore , even if the kinematical data are restricted to the three lowest order moments of the distribution function along the major ( and sometimes minor ) axis , we can expect to be able to put meaningful constraints on the dark matter content and mass , a point already made in dejonghe et al . .",
    "3i models have a larger freedom in distributing stars over all possible orbits than 2i models , widening somewhat the range of possible solutions that is consistent with the data .",
    "we fitted models to the data of each galaxy with various values for the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eqn .",
    "( [ pot ] ) . the model with the lowest @xmath34-value , which most closely reproduces the data ,",
    "is retained as the best model .",
    "the uncertainties on the dynamical quantities presented in this paper are derived from the range of allowed models ( all models within the 95% confidence level are deemed acceptable ) .",
    "the major and minor axis j - band photometry and kinematics of ngc205 as measured by simien & prugniel are presented in fig .",
    "[ kin205 ] .",
    "these data were derived from spectra with a 25  km  s@xmath39 velocity resolution , using a fourier - fitting technique .",
    "detailed simulations showed that template mismatch has little effect on the kinematical parameters @xcite .",
    "there is a slight degeneracy between the velocity dispersion and the metallicity : a template of too high a metallicity will give too large a dispersion .",
    "the template star we used has a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath113 @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that for a galaxy with [ fe / h]@xmath114 and a template with [ fe / h]@xmath113 , the dispersion can be overestimated by @xmath115% at most .",
    "however , the fitting procedure includes an additive continuum which decreases the mismatch by an order of magnitude .",
    "age mismatch , as is likely to be the case in the peculiar nucleus of ngc205 , is not expected to bias the kinematics .",
    "ngc205 has a very steep central density cusp or nucleus ( see panel * a * of fig . [ kin205 ] ) . within the inner 3 arcseconds ,",
    "the j - band surface brightness becomes almost 2 mag  arcsec@xmath108 brighter .",
    "this sudden density jump is reflected in a corresponding drop of the velocity dispersion by about 10  km  s@xmath39 towards the center ; from @xmath116  km  s@xmath39 at a radius of 10@xmath117 down to a central velocity dispersion of @xmath118  km  s@xmath39 ( see panels * b * and * c * of fig .",
    "[ kin205 ] ) .",
    "the nucleus of ngc205 therefore appears to be a round and very dense but dynamically cold substructure .",
    "outside the nucleus , the velocity dispersion was found to rise outwardly from 30@xmath119  km  s@xmath39 near the center up to about 45@xmath120  km  s@xmath39 at 300 .",
    "the rotation velocity rises to a maximum of 20@xmath121  km  s@xmath39 at 200 and declines again beyond that radius .",
    "this was the first clear detection of rotation in this galaxy .",
    "there is evidence that the mean velocity reverses sign at a radius of about 300 .",
    "this feature agrees with other observations @xcite that suggest that the tidal forces of m31 only appreciably affect the outer regions of ngc205 , beyond 5 .",
    "moreover , the absence of minor - axis rotation @xcite and the presence of a very dense nucleus , which is likely to scatter stars off box - orbits , which are the backbone of any slowly rotating triaxial mass - distribution , into loop - orbits @xcite both argue against ngc205 having a strongly triaxial mass distribution , justifying our assumption of an oblate geometry for the construction of dynamical models .    previous work on the kinematics of ngc205 has yielded contradictory results .",

    "the run of the radial velocity dispersion along the @xmath59-axis closely traces the minor - axis projected velocity dispersion , as expected ; cf . the maximum around 0.2  kpc ( 50 ) .",
    "in a 3i model , the radial and vertical velocity dispersions are decoupled .",

    "however , this is not our intention :  we are interested in quantifying the amount of dark matter at large radii . since the nucleus contributes only of the order of 0.1  % of the total mass of the galaxy , our total mass estimates are robust .    thus , the nucleus of ngc205 is structurally and dynamically not unlike a massive globular cluster .",
    "the orbital decay time scale for a globular cluster in ngc205 by dynamical friction is of the order @xmath156 years , significantly less than a hubble time @xcite , which makes it plausible that one or more star clusters have spiraled inwards and settled at the bottom of the gravitational well .",
    "though detailed n - body simulations of this process are still lacking , the observed properties of the ngc205 nucleus are not inconsistent with this scenario .      the trgb distance estimates from mcconnachie place ngc205 @xmath157  kpc behind m31 .",
    "the 1@xmath98 error on the trgb estimates for the distances of ngc205 and m31 are large enough that it is quite plausible that ngc205 and m31 are at the same distance from the milky way and hence at a relative distance of a mere 10  kpc .    in order to get a rough estimate of how the presence of m31 affects our results , we approximate the gravitational potential of m31 as that of a spherical mass distribution at a distance @xmath158 from ngc205 . for computational ease , we will further assume that the center of mass of m31 lies within the equatorial plane of ngc205 and that distances within the stellar body of ngc205 are much smaller than @xmath158 .",
    "we then axisymmetrize this potential by averaging it over the azimuthal angle @xmath159 .",
    "we finally obtain the expression @xmath160 for the axisymmetric potential corresponding to the tidal field of m31 , up to fourth order in @xmath161 and @xmath162 , with @xmath163 the mass of m31 enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "we plot the gravitational potential of the best fit dynamical model for ngc205 as a function of radius in the equatorial plane .",
    "the top curve is the potential of the model in the absence of m31 . from top to bottom , the other curves indicate the potential in the presence of the axisymmetrized tidal field of m31 for relative distances of 40 , 20 , 10 and 5  kpc between ngc205 and m31 . even for the minimum current relative distance allowed by the observations , i.e. 10  kpc , the tidal influence of the giant spiral galaxy is negligible within the region for which we have kinematical data , that is within the inner 1.2  kpc . in that case , stars beyond 2.8  kpc ( 700 ) are unbound . if ngc205 has passed by m31 with a pericentric distance as small as 5  kpc , stars are unbound beyond a radius of @xmath164  kpc .",
    "these values can be compared with the analytical estimate @xmath165 with @xmath166 the orbital radius of a satellite galaxy with mass @xmath167 around a galaxy with mass @xmath168 , and @xmath169 or 1 , for stars inside the satellite galaxy on prograde or retrograde circular orbits , respectively @xcite . for a pericentric distance of 10 kpc , this yields @xmath170 to 2.0  kpc ( depending on @xmath171 ) ; for a pericentric distance of 5 kpc , this yields @xmath172 to 1.3 kpc .",
    "we substituted the mass of m31 enclosed within a radius @xmath173 for @xmath168 .",
    "these are also the radii where in fig .",
    "[ pot205 ] the `` effective '' potential starts to deviate significantly from that of ngc205 alone .",
    "this makes us confident that we are providing an adequate description of the tidal enfluence of m31 on ngc205 .",
    "small pericentric distances , i.e. smaller than @xmath174  kpc , which may have occurred in the past , lead to a large effect on the force field within the inner 1.2  kpc but also give rise to a tidal radius well within the region constrained by the photometric and kinematical data , in which case the construnction of equilibrium models itself becomes meaningless . in short ,",

    "depending on the spectral resolution , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra , and the method of extracting kinematical data from the spectra , the velocity dispersion estimates for the same galaxy can differ by a factor of @xmath209 between different authors , with lower resolution observations tending to yield higher values for the velocity dispersion .",
    "this , exacerbated by the difficulty of measuring core - radii and surface brightnesses of such diffuse objects , required for use in the standard king formula @xcite , seems to account for at least part of the large spread on the @xmath155 estimates . therefore , these dwarf galaxies contain much less dark matter than was believed to be the case up to now .",
