    "graphical analysis ( ga ) has been routinely used for quantification of positron emission tomography ( pet ) radioligand measurements . the first ga method for measuring primarily tracer uptakes for irreversible kinetics",
    "was introduced by patlak , @xcite , and extended for measuring tracer distribution ( accumulation ) in reversible systems by logan , @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been utilized both with input data acquired from plasma measurements and using the time activity curve from a reference brain region .",
    "they have been used for calculation of tracer uptake rates , absolute distribution volumes ( dv ) and dv ratios ( dvr ) , or , equivalently , for absolute and relative binding potentials ( bp ) .",
    "they are widely used because of their inherent simplicity and general applicability regardless of the specific compartmental model .",
    "the well - known bias , particularly for reversible kinetics , in parameters estimated by ga is commonly attributed to noise in the data , @xcite , and therefore techniques to reduce the bias have concentrated on limiting the impact of the noise .",
    "these include ( i ) rearrangement of the underlying system of linear equations so as to reduce the impact of noise yielding the so - called _ multi - linear _ method ( ma1 ) , @xcite , and a second multi - linear approach ( ma2 ) , @xcite , ( ii ) preprocessing using the method of generalized linear least squares ( glls ) , @xcite , yielding a hybrid glls - ga method , @xcite , ( iii ) use of the method of perpendicular least squares , @xcite , also known as total least squares ( tls ) , @xcite , ( iv ) likelihood estimation , @xcite , ( v ) tikhonov regularization @xcite , ( vi ) principal component analysis , @xcite , and ( vii ) reformulating the method of logan so as to reduce the noise in the denominator , @xcite . here , we turn our attention to another important source of the bias : the model error which is implicit in ga approaches .",
    "the bias associated with ga approaches has , we believe , three possible sources .",
    "the bias arising due to random noise is most often discussed , but errors may also be attributed to the use of numerical quadrature and an approximation of the underlying compartmental model .",
    "it is demonstrated in section  [ sec : theory ] that not only is bias an intrinsic property of the linear model for limited scan durations , which is exaggerated by noise , but also that it may be dominated by the effects of the model error .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations , presented in section  [ sec : validatetheory ] , demonstrate that large bias can result even in the noise - free case .",
    "conditions for over- or under - estimation of the dv due to model error and the extent of bias of the logan plot are quantified analytically .",
    "these lead to the design of a bias correction method , section  [ sec : method ] , which still maintains the elegant simplicity of ga approaches .",
    "this bias reduction is achieved by the introduction of a simple nonlinear term in the model . while this approach adds some moderate computational expense , simulations reported in section  [ sec : resultssc0 ] for the fibrillar amyloid @xmath0 radioligand [ 11c ] benzothiazole - aniline ( pittsburgh compound - b [ pib ] ) , @xcite , illustrate that it greatly reduces bias .",
    "relevant observations are discussed in section  [ sec : diss ] and conclusions presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "for the measurement of dv , existing linear quantification methods for reversible radiotracers with a known input function , i.e. the unmetabolized tracer concentration in plasma , are based on the following linear approximation of the true kinetics developed by logan , @xcite : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the measured _ tissue time activity curve _ (",
    "ttac ) , @xmath5 is the _ input function _ , dv represents the _ distribution volume _ and quantity @xmath6 is a constant . with known @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "we can solve for dv and @xmath6 by the method of linear least squares .",
    "this model , which we denote by ma0 to distinguish it from ma1 and ma2 introduced in @xcite , approximately describes tracer behavior at equilibrium . dividing through by @xmath4 , showing that the dv is the linear slope and @xmath7 the intercept , yields the original logan graphical analysis model , denoted here by logan - ga , @xmath8 in which the dv and intercept @xmath7 are obtained by using linear least squares ( ls ) for the sampled version of ( [ eq : logan ] ) .",
    "although it is well - known that this model often leads to under - estimation of the dv it is still widely used in pet studies . an alternative formulation based on ( [ eq : ma0 ] )",
    "is the so - called ma1 , @xmath9 for which the dv can again be obtained using ls @xcite .",
    "recently another formulation , obtained by division in ( [ eq : ma0 ] ) by @xmath5 instead of @xmath4 , has been developed by zhou _",
    "et al _ , @xcite .",
    "but , as noted by varga _",
    "et al _ in @xcite the noise appears in both the independent and dependent variables in ( [ eq : logan ] ) and thus tls may be a more appropriate model than ls for obtaining the dv . whereas it has been concluded through numerical experiments for tracer [ @xmath10f]fcway and [ @xmath11c]mdl 100,907 , @xcite , that ma1 ( [ eq : multi - lin1 ] ) performs better than other linear methods , including logan - ga ( [ eq : logan ] ) , tls and ma2 @xcite , none of these techniques explicitly deals with the inherent error due to the assumption of model ma0 ( [ eq : ma0 ] ) .",
    "the focus here is thus examination of the model error specifically for logan - ga and ma1 , from which a new method for reduction of model error is designed .      the general three - tissue compartmental model for the reversible radioligand binding kinetics of a given brain region or a voxel can be illustrated as follows , @xcite :    ( 9.200000,3.400000)(0.000000,-3.400000 ) ( 0.0000,-1.2000)(2.0000,1.2000)[c ] ( 2.0000,-1.0000)(1.6000,0.8000)[c ] ( 3.6000,-1.2000)(2.0000,1.2000)[c ] ( 3.6000,-0.7750)(-1,0)1.6000 ( 2.0000,-0.4250)(1,0)1.6000 ( 5.6000,-1.0000)(1.6000,0.8000)[c ] ( 7.2000,-1.2000)(2.0000,1.2000)[c ] ( 7.2000,-0.7750)(-1,0)1.6000 ( 5.6000,-0.4250)(1,0)1.6000 ( 3.6000,-2.2000)(2.0000,1.0000)[c ] ( 3.6000,-3.4000)(2.0000,1.2000)[c ] ( 4.7750,-2.2000)(0,1)1.0000 ( 4.4250,-1.2000)(0,-1)1.0000    here @xmath5 ( kbq / ml ) is the input function , i.e. the unmetabolized radiotracer concentration in plasma , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( kbq / g ) are free radioactivity , nonspecific bound and specific bound tracer concentrations , resp . , and @xmath15 ( ml / min / g ) and @xmath16 ( 1/min ) , @xmath17 , are rate constants . the dv is related to the rate constants as follows @xcite , @xmath18 the numerical implementation for estimating the unknown rate constants of the differential system illustrated in figure  [ fig:3 t ] is difficult because three exponentials are involved in the solution of this system , @xcite .",
    "specifically , without the inclusion of additional prior knowledge , the rate constants may be unidentifiable , @xcite .",
    "fortunately , for most tracers it can safely be assumed that @xmath19 and @xmath20 reach equilibrium rapidly for specific binding regions .",
    "then it is appropriate to use a two - tissue four - parameter ( 2t-4k ) model by binning @xmath13 and @xmath12 to one compartment @xmath21 .",
    "this is equivalent to taking @xmath22 , and hence @xmath23 . on the other hand , for regions without specific binding activity , we know @xmath24 which is equivalent to taking @xmath25 , and it is again appropriate for most radioligands to bin @xmath13 and @xmath12 . the one - tissue compartmental model is then appropriate for regions without specific binding activity .",
    "for some tracers , however , for example the modeling of pib in the cerebellar reference region , the best data fitting is obtained by using the 2t-4k model without binning @xmath13 and @xmath12 , @xcite . assuming the latter , the dv is given by @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , for regions with and without specific binding activity , resp . ignoring the notational differences between the two models , for regions with and without specific binding activity , they are both described by the same abstract mathematical 2t-4k model equations . here , without loss of generality , we present the 2t-4k model equations for specific binding regions , @xmath28 to obtain the equations appropriate for regions without specific binding activity , @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath13 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are interpreted as the association and dissociation parameters of regions without specific binding activity . to simplify the explanation @xmath14 , @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are used throughout for both regions with and without specific binding activity , with the assumption that @xmath14 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 should automatically be replaced by @xmath13 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , when relevant .    the solution of the linear differential system ( [ eq:2t4kc1])-([eq:2t4kcs ] )",
    "is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the convolution operation , @xmath35 the overall concentration of radioactivity is @xmath36 integrating ( [ eq:2t4kc1])-([eq:2t4kcs ] ) and rearranging yields @xmath37 this is model ( [ eq : ma0 ] ) when @xmath14 is linearly proportional to @xmath4 for a time window within the scan duration of @xmath38 minutes .",
    "the accuracy of linear methods based on ( [ eq : ma0 ] ) is thus dependent on the validity of the assumption that @xmath14 and @xmath39 are approximately linearly proportional to @xmath4 over a time window within @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "logan observed that @xmath39 and @xmath14 are roughly proportional to @xmath4 , after some time point @xmath41 , @xcite .",
    "if the assumption of linear proportionality breaks down for the given window , @xmath42 $ ] , bias in the estimated uptake rate or dv will be introduced , as shown later in section  [ sec : resultssc0 ] , due to the intrinsic model error of a ga method . indeed , in section",
    "[ subsec : equilibrium ] we show that , for the pib radioligand on some regions with small @xmath30 , there is no window within a @xmath2 minutes scan duration where @xmath14 and @xmath4 are linearly proportional .",
    "this is despite the apparent good linearity , visually , of the logan plot of @xmath43 against @xmath44 . waiting for equilibrium , which may take several hours , is impractical in terms of patient comfort , cost and measurement of radioactivities .",
    "the limitation of the constant approximation can be analysed theoretically .",
    "because @xmath45 and @xmath5 is very small for large time the convolution @xmath46 is relatively small .",
    "we can safely assume that the ratio of @xmath47 to @xmath48 is roughly @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath14 , see equation ( [ sol : cs ] ) , is approximately proportional to @xmath51 for @xmath50 . in our tests with pib , the neglected component @xmath52 is less than @xmath53 for @xmath54 min .. on the other hand , this is not the case for @xmath39 , see equation ( [ sol : c_1 ] ) , because @xmath55 and @xmath56 need not be of the same scale .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 we know @xmath58 from ( [ symb : a1 ] ) , thus @xmath59 .",
    "specifically , @xmath60 may not be small in relation to @xmath61 .",
    "thus , it is not appropriate , as is assumed for the logan - ga ( [ eq : logan ] ) and other linear methods derived from ma0 , to approximate @xmath62 as constant for @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "one may argue that if @xmath64 is close to @xmath65 the term @xmath66 in @xmath4 could be ignored .",
    "then the ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath14 would be close to constant after @xmath41 , and the resulting estimates of the dv using logan - ga ( [ eq : logan ] ) and ma1 ( [ eq : multi - lin1 ] ) would be reasonable . while it is easy to verify that @xmath64 is positive and bounded above by one , this fraction need not be close to its upper bound .",
    "indeed , for realistic test data , see table  [ tab : ki ] , @xmath67 .",
    "the simulations presented in tables  [ tab : overest ] and [ tab : sc0 ] validate that a small value of this fraction may cause a problem in the estimation of the dv using the linear logan - ga and ma1 methods .",
    "it is immediate using @xmath68 , and positivity of both @xmath69 and @xmath70 , that @xmath71 is bounded above and below , @xmath72 and @xmath73 determines the variation in @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath30 is small the bound is not tight and the dv estimated by logan - ga , or a linear method derived from ma0 , may not be accurate , see for example the regions of interest ( rois ) * 1 * , * 3 * and * 6 * in the test examples reported in table  [ tab : ki ] .",
    "we reiterate that , by the discussion above , the variation for roi  * 6 * , within which no specific binding activity exist , is determined by @xmath74 .",
    "this relationship between the size of @xmath30 and the bias in the logan - ga estimate of the dv is illustrated in figure  [ fig : bias_k4 ] of section  [ subsec : equilibrium ] for the test data of table  [ tab : ki ] .",
    "the complete mathematical result for the model error of logan - ga and ma0 is presented in the _",
    "appendix_. similar results , omitted here to save space , can be obtained for ma1 .",
    "the main conclusion is that both logan - ga and ma0 can lead to an over - estimation of the dv .",
    "this contrasts the standard view of these methods .",
    "we summarize in the following theorem , for which the main idea is to show that replacing ( [ b_range ] ) which occurs on the right hand side of ( [ eq : sfunc ] ) by a constant intercept @xmath6 introduces an error in the least squares solution for the dv which can be specifically quantified .",
    "[ thm : logan_bias ] suppose logan - ga , or respectively ma0 , are used for noise - free data acquired for @xmath75 frames with frame time @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then , with @xmath71 as defined in ( [ b_range ] ) , for each method the same conclusions are reached :    * the dv is over - estimated ( under - estimated ) if @xmath78,$ ] is a non - constant decreasing ( increasing ) function , and * the dv is exact if @xmath78,$ ] is a constant function ;    let @xmath79 be the true value of the dv , and define the variation of a function over @xmath80 $ ] by @xmath81}{\\mathbf { x}}(t)-\\displaystyle\\min_{t \\in [ t_l , t_n ] } { \\mathbf { x}}(t)|.\\ ] ] then the bias in @xmath82 calculated by logan - ga is bounded by @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "this theorem is an immediate result of lemma  [ lemma : ma1_ana ] and corollary  [ cor : logan - ga ] in the _ appendix _ for the vectors obtained from the sampling of the functions @xmath85 @xmath86 at discrete time points @xmath87 the relevant vectors are defined by @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , where the division corresponds to componentwise division .",
    "it is easy to check that all these vectors are positive vectors , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are non - constant increasing vectors and @xmath95 is decreasing .",
    "thus all conditions for lemma  [ lemma : ma1_ana ] and corollary  [ cor : logan - ga ] are satisfied .",
    "note that in the denominator of ( [ logandv_bound ] ) the simplification @xmath96 is used . in the latter discussion we may use the variation ( increasing or decreasing ) of @xmath70 instead of that of @xmath71 because @xmath97    it is not surprising that the properties of logan - ga and ma0 are similar . indeed ,",
    "ma0 is none other than weighted logan - ga with weights @xmath98 , which changes the noise structure in the variables .",
    "in contrast to the conventional under - estimation observations , it is suprising that the dv may be over - estimated .",
    "however , the over - estimation is indeed observed in the tests presented in section [ sec : overest ] and [ sec : resultssc0 ] .",
    "inequality ( [ logandv_bound ] ) indicates that logan - type linear methods will work well for data for which @xmath99 is flat .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath99 may become flat only for a late time interval .",
    "thus our interest , in section  [ sec : method ] , is to better estimate the dv using a reasonable ( practical ) time window , which may include the window over which @xmath70 is still increasing .",
    "our initial focus is on the modification of logan - type methods .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : validatetheory ] we present numerical simulations using noise - free data which illustrate the difficulties with logan - ga and ma1 , and support the results of theorem  [ thm : logan_bias ] .",
    "in the previous discussion we have seen the theoretical limitations of the logan - ga and ma1 methods . here",
    "we present a new model and associated algorithm which assists with reducing the bias in the estimation of the dv .",
    "observe that , @xmath100 , implies that @xmath101 , where @xmath102 can be ignored for @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath50 ( [ eq : root ] ) can be approximated by a new model as follows @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this suggests new algorithms should be developed for estimation of parameters dv , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . here ,",
    "a new approach , based on the basis function method ( bfm ) in @xcite , in which @xmath108 is discretized , is given by the following algorithm .",

    "[ remark : alpha1 ] the interval for @xmath108 is determined as follows : first the lower bound @xmath132 for @xmath108 is suitable for most tracers , but could be reduced appropriately .",

    "the estimate of dv will still be acceptable .",

    "such _ unsuccessful _ results occur only for the higher noise level ( @xmath183 ) . while there was only one such occurrence for the logan - ga ( @xmath1 min . with roi  * 9 * ) , there were @xmath185 such occurrences for ma1 , @xmath186 for the shorter time interval of @xmath1 minutes ( rois  * 1 * , * 3 * , * 4 * , * 5 * , * 6 * , * 8 * and * 9 * ) and @xmath187 for the longer interval of @xmath2 minutes , ( rois  * 1 * and * 6 * ) .",
    "the reason for the negative dv for ma1 is discussed in section  [ subsec : negdv ] .",
    "from the results for the higher noise @xmath183 we conclude that algorithm  [ alg : biascor_guo ] using the shorter @xmath1 minutes scan duration outperforms the other algorithms , even in comparison to their results for the longer scan duration .",
    "obviously algorithm  [ alg : biascor_guo ] is more expensive computationally than logan - ga and ma1 . in the simulations , the average cpu time , in seconds , per ttac was @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , for logan - ga , ma1 , ka and algorithm [ alg : biascor_guo ] , respectively . the high cost of the ka results from the requirement to use a nonlinear algorithm .",
    "because the ka requires a good initial estimate for the parameters the cost is variable for each ttac ; it is dependent on whether the supplied initial value is a good initial estimate .",
    "indeed the ka results take from @xmath192 to @xmath193 seconds , while the costs using the other methods are virtually ttac independent .",
    "the graphical analysis methods of logan - type rely on the assumption that the ratio @xmath14 to @xmath4 is approximately constant within a chosen window @xmath42 $ ] . this ratio is plotted against time for the simulated data for rois * 1 * to * 11 * in figure  [ fig : cs2ct90 ] .",
    "it is clear that the ratios for rois  * 1 * , * 3 * and * 6 * have not reached equilibrium even by @xmath2 minutes .",

    "moreover , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ga - plot ] , using the linearity of @xmath196 versus @xmath197 to verify whether equilibrium has been reached may be misleading .",

    "as discussed in section  [ subsec : errana ] , a small value of @xmath30 may cause a large variation in @xmath71 .",
    "this graph verifies that the magnitude of the bias decreases as @xmath30 increases , further verifying that large bias in dv may arise purely due to modeling assumptions in the absence of noise in the data .",
    "for the eleven rois , assuming noise - free data , a scan duration of @xmath2 minutes and @xmath180 minutes . the specific data pairs ( @xmath30 , bias )",
    "are , for rois  * 1 * to 11 , respectively , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 . ]",
    "both logan - ga and ma1 , ( [ eq : logan ] ) and ( [ eq : multi - lin1 ] ) resp .",
    ", require the calculation of integrals @xmath211 and @xmath181 .",
    "assume the noise - free measurements @xmath98 are derived from the integral over the @xmath212th frame duration .",
    "thus we can easily recover its integral without introducing error while quadrature error for calculation of @xmath181 due to using a limited number of plasma samples is unavoidable .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical quadrature impacts the accuracy of the parameter estimates .",
    "note that we classify the noise effects as another source of bias in dv .",
    "we recalculate the dv for the experiments reported in section  [ sec : overest ] , but now using numerical quadrature for calculation of @xmath181 with data sampled one time point per time frame .",
    "the bias for each roi of the estimated dv using @xmath2 minutes scan data with @xmath180 minutes is @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 when calculated using logan - ga , and @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 calculated using ma1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dv calculated for roi  * 7 * is no longer an over - estimate .",
    "this does not contradict the result of theorem  [ thm : logan_bias ] , which predicts that the dv for roi  * 7 * will be over - estimated due to model error , provided that the other aspects of the calculation are accurate . now using a less accurate quadrature",
    "the negative bias due to quadrature error canceled the positive bias due to the model error .",
    "indeed , for all eleven test cases the impact of the less accurate quadrature is to shift the bias down , i.e. it is more negative as compared to the equivalent more accurate calculations shown in table  [ tab : overest ] .      in the eleven simulated rois , large under - estimation of the dv calculated by logan - ga and ma1",
    "is observed for rois  * 1 * ( nc cort ) , * 3 * ( nc pcg ) and * 6 * ( ad cere ) . a lower value of the dv in the cortical regions of ncs and in the cerebellum for ad subjects will result in under - estimation of the dvr for ncs and over - estimation of the dvr for ad subjects when the cerebellum is used as the reference region for the dvr calculation .",
    "thus , the difference between ad and nc can be artificially enhanced , and viewed as a positive outcome associated with the bias of logan - ga and ma1 .",
    "this conclusion , however , can not be generalized .",
    "it is unknown whether it is always the case that ad / nc have small / large @xmath32 in cerebellar regions and relatively large / small @xmath30 in cortical regions .",
    "confirmation of these assertions would suggest , based on the discussion in sections  [ subsec : errana ] and [ subsec : equilibrium ] , that the dvr is over - estimated for ad subjects and under - estimated for healthy subjects ( also see figure  [ fig : bias_k4 ] ) .",
    "in addition , more subtle differences , such as the ones between mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) and nc , or among nc with differential genetic risk for ad , may make the effects of bias much less predictable .",
    "consequently , we evaluate the quantification methods based on their bias because the goal of these methods is to estimate the dv as accurately as possible .",
    "as noted in section  [ subsec : noisy ] , ma1 generates some results with negative dvs .",
    "such results are reported as _",
    "unsuccessful _ in ichise s original paper @xcite",
    ". careful study of these results shows that the negative dvs arise when @xmath235 has the wrong sign . for most radioligand binding studies",
    "@xmath236 is a small positive number because @xmath237 , which is usually larger than @xmath238 , see remark  ( [ remark : alpha1 ] ) of algorithm  [ alg : biascor_guo ] .",
    "thus a small error in the estimate of @xmath235 due to large noise in the data may change its sign .",
    "this in turn impacts the sign of the estimate of the dv .",
    "in this article , we quantified the model error in estimating distribution volume using graphical analysis methods .",
    "we described the conditions under which the dv is either over- or under - estimated , and quantified the bias caused by model error .",
    "we validated our findings through simulations with noise - free data . to reduce the impact of model error",
