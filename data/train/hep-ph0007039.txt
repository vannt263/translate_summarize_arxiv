    "the b - meson system is interesting and rich phenomenologically , providing a comprehensive information on the theoretical models . with the forthcoming experiments at slac , kek b - factories , hera - b and possible future accelerators , the large number of events can take place and various branching ratios of events , cp - violating asymmetries , polarization effects , etc ...",
    "can be measured @xcite .",
    "this will lead to test the models underconsideration and to determine corresponding free parameters .",
    "loop induced processes are sensitive to the parameters of the models used .",
    "therefore , they open a window for the determination of these parameters and investigation of new models . among these type of decays ,",
    "inclusive @xmath7 reached a great interest since it is theoretically clean and sensitive to new physics beyond sm , like two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm)@xcite , minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , etc ... .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath8 of @xmath7 decay in the sm is @xmath9 for on - shell gluon @xcite and the enhancement of this ratio brings an advantage @xcite to decrease the averaged cham multiplicity @xmath10 @xcite and to increase kaon yields @xcite .",
    "this enhancement can be obtained by including the qcd corrections or looking for new models beyond the sm . in the literature , there are number of theoretical calculations on the @xmath8 of the corresponding process beyond the sm . in @xcite , @xmath11",
    "was calculated in the 2hdm ( model i and ii ) for @xmath12 and @xmath13 and it was found that there was an enhancement less than one order .",
    "this decay was studied in the supersymmetric models @xcite and further , the @xmath8 was calculated in the framework of the model iii @xcite , resulting with the enhancement at least one order compared to the sm one .",
    "this make it possible to describe the results coming from experiments @xcite .    in the case of time - like gluon , namely @xmath14 decay",
    ", @xmath8 should be consistent with the cleo data @xcite @xmath15 and in @xcite , it was showed that the model iii enhancement was not contradict with this data for light - like gluon case .    as a further process",
    ", @xmath16 can decay into quark - quark @xmath17 or gluon - gluon ( gg ) pairs .",
    "inclusive three body decay @xmath0 is another interesting one which is studied in the literature extensively @xcite .",
    "it becomes not only from the chain process @xmath14 followed by @xmath18 but also from the emission of on - shell gluons from the quark lines to obey gauge invariance . in @xcite ,",
    "the complete calculation was done in the sm and @xmath8 ratio was found at the order of @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    "the additional contribution of gluon penguins in the model iii was estimated as negligible .",
    "this work is devoted to the study of the complete calculation for @xmath0 decay in the model iii and we find that the decay width ( @xmath20 ) is strongly sensitive to the charged higgs mass @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to get a considerable enhancement in @xmath20 even 2 orders larger compared to the sm case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give a brief summary for the model iii .",
    "further , we calculate the matrix element and decay width of the inclusive @xmath21 decay in the framework of the model iii .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions . in appendix , we present the form factors appearing in the sm .",
    "the yukawa interaction in the model iii can be defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote chiral projections @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 , are the two scalar doublets .",
    "the yukawa matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 have in general complex entries . with the choice of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32\\ , ;   \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c }   \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the vacuum expectation values , @xmath33 the sm particles are collected in the first doublet and particles due to new physics in the second one .",
    "the part of yukawa interaction which is responsible for physics beyond the sm is the flavor changing ( fc ) interaction and can be written as @xmath34 where the couplings @xmath35 for the fc charged interactions are @xmath36 and @xmath37 is defined by the expression ( more details see @xcite ) @xmath38 note that the index `` n '' in @xmath37 denotes the word `` neutral '' .",
    "now we start with the decay amplitude of the decay @xmath0 @xmath39 where @xmath40 are polarization vectors of the gluons with color @xmath41 and momentum @xmath42 . using the same parametrization for @xmath43 as in @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be obtained by the replacements @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the function @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the functions @xmath48 and @xmath45 , in general , contain masses of internal quarks @xmath50 in the sm and also @xmath51 in the model iii , since the process underconsideration takes place at least at one loop level .",
    "therefore , at this stage , we take into account two different possibilities ,    * the mass of internal quark is heavy ( namely , @xmath52-quark ) , * the mass of internal quark is light ( namely , @xmath53-quarks ) .    in the heavy internal quark case ,",
    "the terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 are neglected and the form factors are obtained as functions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath3 is the mass of charged higgs boson in the model iii . neglecting @xmath1-quark mass , @xmath48 for the heavy internal quark",
    "is given by @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the momentum transfer , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the ckm matrix combination @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the form factor @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the magnetic dipole form factor of @xmath66 vertex ( see appendix ) .",
    "@xmath67 is the contribution coming from the charged higgs boson in the model iii : @xmath68 and @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ fbeyond1 ] ) we used the redefinition @xmath70 note that we neglect the chiral partner of the form factor @xmath67 and the neutral higgs boson effects which should be very small due to the discussion given in @xcite ( see also discussion part ) .",
    "if the internal quark is light ( @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) , the first additional contribution comes from @xmath73 and @xmath74 terms . in the approximation @xmath75 ,",
    "it is enough to replace @xmath65 with @xmath76 since @xmath77 by unitarity , namely @xmath78 .",
    "there is no additional term coming from light quark for @xmath67 , since @xmath79 almost vanishes . for light internal quark ,",
    "the second additional contribution comes from @xmath80 term which can not be neglected as in the heavy internal quark case .",
    "this contribution was calculated in the literature @xcite and we give its explicit form in appendix .",
    "therefore , the resulting amplitude can be written as @xmath81 and @xmath82 is given in eq .",
    "( [ tfunch ] ) , @xmath83 can be obtained from @xmath82 with the replacement @xmath84 and @xmath85 is given in appendix .    the decay amplitude for the process @xmath0 , @xmath43",
    ", can be parametrized by seperating color symmetric and antisymmetric parts @xcite as @xmath86\\,\\ , , \\label{tfunc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 finally we get the differential decay width of the process using the expression @xmath88 where @xmath2 is the @xmath1-quark energy and @xmath89 is the energy of photon with polarization @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath91 is the average decay amplitude @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "now , we divide the differential decay width into sectors as follows :    * symmetric sector , ( @xmath95 ) , * antisymmetric sector , ( @xmath96 ) ,    or    * right sector , ( @xmath97 ) , * left sector , ( @xmath98 ) , * left - rigth mixed sector , ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "antisymmetric and symmetric sectors do not mix and they enter into decay width as @xmath100 with the corresponding color factors @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively . here",
    "we choose the polarization sum of the on - shell gluons as @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "right sector contains form factors which are functions of @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "left one have the form factors which are created by the nonvanishing @xmath108 terms .",
    "left - right sector contains mixed terms and its contribution is negligible .    since there are collinear divergences at the boundary of the kinematical region , we follow the procedure given in @xcite , namely taking a cutoff @xmath72 in the integration over phase space : @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "note that these limits are used in the integration over @xmath89 and to get differential decay width @xmath111 .",
    "there are many free parameters in the model iii such as yukawa couplings , @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 are flavor indices , masses of charged and neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the procedure is to restrict these parameters using the experimental measurements .",
    "since the contributions of the neutral higgs bosons @xmath115 and @xmath116 to the wilson coefficient @xmath5 should not contradict with the cleo measurement @xcite , @xmath117 the couplings @xmath118(@xmath119 and @xmath120 should be negligible ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in addition , the constraints @xcite , coming from the @xmath121 mixing , the @xmath122 parameter @xcite , and the measurement by cleo collaboration results in the following restrictions : @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where the indices @xmath125 denote @xmath126 and @xmath1 quarks . therefore , we can neglect all the couplings except @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this leads to the cancellation of the contributions coming from primed coefficient @xmath129 and from the neutral higgs bosons @xmath115 and @xmath116 , having interactions which include the yukawa vertices with the combinations of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "finally , we only take into account the multiplication of yukawa couplings , @xmath132 and @xmath133 in our expressions .    in this section ,",
    "we study the @xmath1 quark energy @xmath2 , yukawa coupling @xmath4 and charged higgs mass @xmath134 dependencies of the differential decay width @xmath111 for the inclusive decay @xmath0 . in our analysis , we restrict the parameters @xmath135 , @xmath136 using the constraint for @xmath137 , @xmath138 @xcite , where the upper and lower limits were calculated in @xcite following the procedure given in @xcite . throughout these calculations , we take the charged higgs mass @xmath139 , and we use the input values given in table ( [ input ] ) .",

    "solid line represents the sm contribution .",
    "there is a considerable enhancement in the differential decay width especially for @xmath142 case . besides , the allowed region becomes larger for @xmath142 .",
    "[ tauasysy ] is devoted to the @xmath2 dependence of color antisymmetric and symmetric part of @xmath111 .",
    "the color antisymmetric part lies in the region bounded by dash - dotted ( dotted ) lines and the color symmetric part by dashed ( solid ) lines , for @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "this figure shows that , for @xmath142 , the contribution of the color antisymmetric part is greater than that of color symmetric one .",
    "this is true also for @xmath143 case .",
    "however the contribution of the color symmetric part for @xmath142 exceeds that of the color antisymmetric one for @xmath143 .",
    "the allowed region becomes narrower for @xmath143 ( see dotted and solid lines ) .",
    "note that the contributions due to the sm is presented by the solid and dashed lines which almost coincide with the x - axis .",

    "solid line represents right , dashed line left and dotted line left - right contributions .",
    "the left one exceeds the right one up to almost @xmath144 since the @xmath145 contribution , responsible for left part , is comparable with the heavy internal quark , namely @xmath146 , contribution .",
    "left - right mixed part is very small and has also negative values .",
    "for the model iii we have only right additional contributions since there is no left part beyond the sm in our approximation .    in fig .  [ taudbbe12es1a ] and fig .  [ taudbbe12es1b ] , we present the @xmath4 dependence of of @xmath111 for fixed values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "it is seen that there is almost no dependence on the parameter @xmath4 especially for its large values .    for completeness , we also present @xmath3 dependence of @xmath111 for fixed values of @xmath149 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 for @xmath143 ( fig .  [ taumhe12es1 ] ) . here",
    "the restricted region is bounded by solid lines .",
    "this figure shows that there is a strong dependence on the mass @xmath3 .",
    "now we would like to give some numerical results for our calculations . the total decay width for @xmath150 transition is @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are qcd sensitive parameters @xcite @xmath154 for @xmath155 .",
    "eeasy calculation shows that the total decay width is @xmath156 .    in our calculation",
    ", we obtain the decay width for the sm as @xmath157 . for @xmath139 and @xmath158 ,",
    "the model iii result is four ( three ) orders larger for @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) compared to the sm result .",
    "this is a strong enhancement contradict with the total decay width given above .",
    "this forces us to choose the sign of @xmath5 as negative ( @xmath143 ) and also to take large values of charged higgs mass , @xmath3 . for @xmath159 , @xmath158 and @xmath143",
    "we get : @xmath160    in conclusion , we get a considerable enhancement in the decay width of the process @xmath21 in the model iii . the enhancement can be suppressed by choosing @xmath143 and increasing lower bound of charged higgs mass , @xmath3 .",
    "further , the decay width of the process under consideration is not sensitive to the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "here we present the magnetic dipole form factor @xmath65 and the additional form factors due to the non - vanishing @xmath108 terms .",
