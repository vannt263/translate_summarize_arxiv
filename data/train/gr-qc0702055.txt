    "cosmic strings and their dynamics have been studied for more than twenty - five years .",
    "although much is known about the formation and evolution of cosmic string networks  @xcite , the complexity of these systems still stands in the way of a complete understanding .",
    "it is generally believed that , after their formation , the networks evolve into a scaling regime where all length scales grow linearly with the hubble time .",
    "this would imply that the typical size of cosmic string loops is a fixed fraction @xmath1 of the horizon scale . however , there is no consensus on the value of the proportionality constant @xmath1 ; in fact , estimates range over tens of orders of magnitude .",
    "a key question is whether the smoothing of the string by gravitational radiation is necessary for scaling of the loop sizes .",
    "if so , @xmath1 will depend on the dimensionless string tension @xmath2 , because the emission of gravitational radiation is proportional to this parameter . if not",
    ", then the evolution of the network will be purely geometric , and @xmath1 will be a pure number , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "for many years , simulations appeared to show loops forming at the short distance cutoff scale , and this was interpreted as implying the need to include gravitational radiation .",
    "several recent simulations , however , indicate that the loops are actually forming above the cutoff scale , so that @xmath1 will be independent of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite finds notably large loops , @xmath3 , while refs .",
    "@xcite find loops a few orders of magnitude smaller .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we attempted to construct an analytic model of the small scales in cosmic string networks .",
    "we had some success in understanding the two - point functions of the tangent vector and velocity on long strings .",
    "however , loop production was found to diverge at small scales , and we had no means to deal with the resulting strongly nonlinear dynamics .    in sec .",
    "2 we use our model to study gravitational radiation from long strings .",
    "it was long assumed that this radiation smoothed the strings on scales of order the horizon length times @xmath2 , so this would be the size of loops if they formed at the gravitational radiation cutoff  @xcite",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite showed the radiation from long strings had been overestimated , and so it becomes important only at a shorter length scale , proportional to a larger power of @xmath2  @xcite ; the exponent depends on the power spectrum of fluctuations on the long string .",
    "here we rederive the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in perhaps a simpler way .",
    "our result for the exponent of @xmath2 differs somewhat from ref .",
    "this difference arises in going from the periodic wave train calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to the random distribution on the actual network .",
    "also , we use input from our model  @xcite and from simulations  @xcite to determine the actual power spectrum on the long string .    in sec .  3 we discuss loop production",
    "we use the results from  sec .  2 to find the cutoff on loop sizes .",
    "it is notable that in our model these smallest loops will be highly relativistic .",
    "we then consider the recent simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are able to cover the longest time scales , and which show large loops .",
    "these simulations also show a population of small loops near the cutoff scale , which are claimed to be transient .",
    "we instead argue on several grounds that these smaller loops are a real effect , so that the true loop distribution has _ two _ peaks .",
    "one scales at @xmath3 , while the second is presumably at the scale set by gravitational radiation .",
    "we discuss how the resulting picture affects current limits and future sensitivity of searches for cosmic strings .",
    "in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath3 loops produce a much larger stochastic background than in previous network scenarios , tightening existing bounds and increasing the potential for discovery .",
    "if these loops represent only a fraction of the total string length then this effect is somewhat reduced , but still significant .",
    "we also discuss the gravitational wave signatures of the small loops , and the interaction between the short distance structure and the string cusps .",
    "let us first review some of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the small scale structure on a long cosmic string .",
    "the motion of a cosmic string in a three - dimensional target space can be described by a map @xmath4 , where @xmath5 parametrizes the distance along the string and @xmath6 is the frw time .",
    "denote @xmath7 by a prime and @xmath8 by a dot ( where @xmath9 is the scale factor and @xmath10 is the conformal time ) , and define @xmath11 .",
    "then in transverse gauge , @xmath12 the quantities @xmath13 are unit vectors . in flat space these describe simply left- and right - moving waves . in an expanding universe",
    "the equations of motion derived from the nambu action introduce a correction to the wave equation which is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "to better understand the small scale behavior of cosmic string networks a model was developed in  @xcite that focused on the two - point functions @xmath15 .",
    "this correlator must vanish at scales larger than the horizon size due to causality , while it encodes the short distance structure observed at smaller scales . assuming that stretching of the network as spacetime expands gives the dominant behavior at scales small compared to the horizon but long compared to the gravitational radiation scale , the two - point function was determined to be @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the physical separation ( weighted by the local value of @xmath18 along the string ) .",
    "this quantity is a function of the ratio @xmath19 only and so it scales properly .",
    "the exponent @xmath20 is a function of the rate of change of the scale factor and also the rms velocity of the strings , @xmath21 . for a power law expansion of the form @xmath22",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath23 in a flat spacetime the virial theorem imposes @xmath24 ( in natural units ) but due to expansion @xmath25 .",
    "thus , for a decelerating universe the exponent @xmath20 is a positive number , taking the specific values @xmath26 in the radiation dominated era and @xmath27 in the matter dominated era .",
    "these exponents are in reasonable agreement with the two - point functions given in ref .",
    "@xcite over a range of scales below the horizon size , with the normalization @xmath28 found to be @xmath29 in both the matter and radiation epochs . at smaller scales",
    "the simulations seem to indicate a larger exponent @xmath30 , corresponding to the functions @xmath31 mapping out a random walk on the unit sphere .",
    "we are unable to identify a physical mechanism that would produce this effect , and believe that the discrepancy is due to transients in the simulations . in any event",
    ", our discussion below just uses the general power law form  ( [ pp ] ) , and one can insert any assumed values for @xmath20 and @xmath28 .    also useful for the computations in the next section is the small fluctuation approximation introduced in  @xcite . in this framework the structure on a small segment is expressed as a large term that is constant along the segment plus a small fluctuation : @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "an equivalent equation can also be written for the right - moving vector @xmath35 .",
    "equation  ( [ pp ] ) can then be expressed in terms of the fluctuations as @xmath36 ^ 2 \\rangle   + o(w^4_\\pm ) \\approx   { \\cal a } ( l / t)^{2\\chi } \\ . \\label{ww}\\ ] ]      gravitational radiation is important on scales short compared to the hubble time and so we can use the flat metric diag@xmath37 , and also make the gauge choice @xmath38 . and @xmath39 . ]",
    "the modes are then functions only of @xmath40 or @xmath41 , so that @xmath42^{2\\chi } \\ , \\quad \\langle { \\bf p}_- ( v ) \\cdot { \\bf p}_- ( v ' ) \\rangle \\approx 1 -   { \\cal a } [ ( v - v')/t]^{2\\chi } \\ ; \\ ] ] ( the explicit @xmath6 on the right - hand side is effectively a fixed parameter , varying only over the hubble time ) .",
    "the energy radiated per unit solid angle in the @xmath43 direction is given by  @xcite @xmath44 with the left- and right - moving contributions given respectively by @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the gravitational radiation wave vector , and @xmath47 are null 4-vectors whose time component is identically 1 and with @xmath31 being the unit vectors above .",
    "these are related to the standard notation @xmath48\\ ] ] via @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the spirit of the small fluctuation approximation we orient a given segment of string mainly along the @xmath51-axis and consider fluctuations @xmath52 in the perpendicular @xmath53-plane .",
    "thus , @xmath54 we can ignore the last two terms in equation  ( [ energy ] ) : they are equal when @xmath55 is real , and so cancel when ensemble - averaged over the short distance structure .",
    "let us review the argument of refs .",
    "first linearize the modes  ( [ ab ] ) in the oscillations , so the exponential factors become @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , with @xmath58 here @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the frequency and wavenumber of the radiation .",
    "then the ensemble averages in the linearized approximation ( @xmath61 ) are @xmath62 here @xmath63 , taking the values 1.25 and 0.57 in the matter- and radiation - dominated eras respectively . the convergence factor @xmath64 accounts for the decay of the correlations on horizon scales ; its detailed form is unimportant at shorter scales .",
    "the factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 are volume regulators : we artificially cut the oscillations off to produce finite trains , but these regulators of course drop out when we consider rates per unit time and length . using @xmath67",
    "we can write the total energy radiated as @xmath68 the volume of the world - sheet is @xmath69 , so this translates into a power per unit length @xmath70 the total energy of the wavetrains is @xmath71 isolating a momentum range @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 we have used the fact that momentum conservation determines that the energy coming from the @xmath74 and @xmath75 modes is in the proportion @xmath76 to @xmath77 . a given point @xmath78 interacts with the @xmath79 train for a time @xmath80 ,",
    "so the rate of decay becomes @xmath81 the integral is dominated by the lower limit : most of the energy loss from the left - moving mode @xmath76 comes from its interaction with right - moving modes of much longer wavelength .",
    "cutting off the lower end of the @xmath77 integral at the horizon scale , @xmath82 , we find that the decay rate is of order @xmath83 .",
    "this is faster than the hubble time for @xmath84 meaning that modes with wavelengths @xmath85 are exponentially suppressed .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ naive ] ) reproduces the usual ( naive ) estimate for the gravitational damping length .",
    "the calculation above implies that the energy loss from the left - moving modes @xmath76 comes primarily from their interaction with much longer right - moving modes at the horizon scale .",
    "@xcite argued that this was paradoxical , because a wave that encounters an oncoming perturbation with much longer wavelength is essentially traveling on a straight string , and such a wave will not radiate .",
    "they showed that this paradox arose due to the neglect of the exponential terms in the modes  ( [ ab ] ) . with their inclusion",
    ", the radiation is exponentially suppressed when the ratio of @xmath76 to @xmath77 becomes sufficiently large .",
    "@xcite considered monochromatic wavetrains @xmath86 and found that the gravitational radiation was suppressed unless @xmath87 the first of these relations will cut off the integral  ( [ decay1 ] ) below the horizon scale , but first we need to extend it to the incoherent spectrum on a long cosmic string .",
    "we will do this in a systematic way below , but we can anticipate the answer . for a continuous spectrum , of course ,",
    "a single frequency makes a contribution of measure zero .",
    "the natural extrapolation is then to replace @xmath88 with the rms average in bands of frequencies @xmath89 .",
    "that is , @xmath90 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim & ( k_b t)^{-2\\chi}\\ ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath91 is a plausible choice , corresponding to integrating over one unit of log frequency , but the precise value does not matter . in the second line",
    "the filter function @xmath92 has a width of order @xmath93 and a magnitude of order @xmath77 . in the third line",
    ", we have used the two - point function  ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath94    using this lower cutoff in the decay rate  ( [ decay1 ] ) gives @xmath95 this is faster than the hubble rate for @xmath96 the gravitational length scale is reduced from the naive @xmath97 by a factor @xmath98 .",
    "the qualitative conclusion is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the exponents do not seem to agree .",
    "the result there was @xmath99 .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath100 is to be identified with @xmath101 ( as suggested by eq .",
    "( 21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , compared with eq .",
    "( [ decay1 ] ) above ) or with @xmath20 ( as suggested by @xcite eq .",
    "( 31 ) ) , but in either case the exponents differ .",
    "this stems from a different method of converting from the single - mode result to the continuous spectrum ; our exponent will be borne out by the more formal treatment below .",
    "finally , recalling sec .",
    "2.1 , our analytic model  @xcite gives for the exponent @xmath102 the values 1.2 in the radiation era and 1.5 in the matter era ; using instead the simulations  @xcite would yield an exponent around 2.0 at the shortest scales in both eras .",
    ", so that their eq .",
    "( 31 ) is @xmath103    the necessary correction to the naive radiation formula comes from the previously neglected exponential factor in @xmath104 , eq .",
    "( [ ab ] )  @xcite . expanding the exponential to second order in the fluctuations gives @xmath105 noting that @xmath106 , when the first term in the exponent is of order one , the second and third terms in the exponent are respectively of order @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "thus , as @xmath77 decreases they become important at precisely the scale  ( [ socut ] ) where the small - amplitude calculation is expected to break down .",
    "the linearized form for @xmath109 remains valid , so we can simply insert the corrected form  ( [ bexp ] ) into the decay rate  ( [ adecay ] ) .    by completing the square , the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ bexp ] ) can be written as @xmath110 ^ 2   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] converting @xmath111 , we have at fixed @xmath76 the integral @xmath112 ^ 2   \\right\\ } \\   .\\quad \\label{bexp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have used @xmath113 , since this is the regime where the correction is important .",
    "we now approximate , replacing both the exponent and the prefactor with their mean values from sec .",
    "then @xmath114 here @xmath115^{2\\chi/(1 + 2\\chi ) } \\left [ \\frac{\\cal a } { 1 + 2\\chi}\\right]^{1/(1 + 2\\chi)}\\ ] ] is 2.5 in the matter era and 2.1 in the radiation era .",
    "we can improve this approximation if we make the assumption that the ensemble is gaussian .",
    "the first order correction , keeping contractions between the prefactor and the exponent , involves a straightforward calculation ; its inclusion simply renormalizes the constant @xmath116 , with @xmath117 \\ .\\ ] ] however , this represents a small correction since @xmath118 in the radiation epoch and @xmath119 in the matter epoch .",
    "thus , to good approximation , @xmath120 this is faster than the hubble rate for the scales  ( [ true ] ) , as deduced earlier .",
    "we can now improve our earlier result for the two - point function  @xcite through the inclusion of gravitational radiation .",
    "define @xmath121 where @xmath5 is related to the actual length along the string by @xmath122 ; here @xmath123 and @xmath124 . combining the stretching given by eq .  2.26 of ref .",
    "@xcite with the gravitational radiation found above gives @xmath125 this is readily integrated , to give @xmath126 the function @xmath127 is obtained by matching onto the known result  ( [ ww ] ) at early times , giving @xmath128 .",
    "expressing the result in terms of the physical momentum scale @xmath129 gives @xmath130 \\ .",
    "\\label{2pf}\\ ] ]    thus , unless we consider modes with such short wavelength that the exponential suppression factor kicks in , we have @xmath131 . at length scales",
    "smaller than @xmath132 this behavior is altered as a result of the inclusion of gravitational radiation , in such a way to make the two - point function smoother . in fig .",
    "[ 2pf plot ] we show the numerical fourier transform of @xmath133 , in terms of the correlation  @xcite @xmath134    .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the matter epoch and the dotted line to the radiation epoch .",
    "the value @xmath135 has been adopted for illustrative purposes . ]",
    "the smoothing at short distance seen in fig .",
    "[ 2pf plot ] resembles that found in the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , but here it is due to an additional physical effect , gravitational radiation , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite such smoothing was found even without gravitational radiation .",
    "goes as @xmath136 at short distance , corresponding to an ensemble of smooth functions , whereas it appears to be close to @xmath137 in ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponding to a random walk in @xmath138 . ]",
    "again , it remains to be seen whether the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is a real effect or a transient . in fig .",
    "[ 2pf plot ] we have assumed the latter , so that the two - point function follows a simple power law down to the gravitational radiation scale .",
    "the exponential falloff in the world - sheet two - point function at large wavenumber implies that the strings are very smooth at short distance . inspection of fig .",
    "[ 2pf plot ] indicates that this smoothing sets in at @xmath139 in both the matter and radiation epochs .",
    "the exponent we obtain is smaller than the estimates in  @xcite : @xmath140 in the radiation dominated era and @xmath141 in the matter dominated era here , compared to @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "the difference is primarily from using a more accurate model of the effect of stretching , leading to a power spectrum with a slower falloff .",
    "the length  @xmath144 is the approximate size of the smallest loops .",
    "in particular , the divergent loop production found in ref .",
    "@xcite is cut off at this scale .",
    "it is customary to parameterize the size of small loops as @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "the parameter @xmath147 corresponds to the lifetime of the loop in units of the frw time , if gravitational radiation is the principal decay mode .",
    "thus we have found @xmath148 in the matter era , while for the radiation era @xmath149    however , for the phenomenology of the small loops there is another important property , first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite : they move _ extremely _ fast .",
    "the point is that the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 must have equal mean values on the loop ( the condition for the loop to form ) .",
    "if the loop is small , so these functions have limited range , this implies that both remain near one point on the sphere , and the velocity ( the average of @xmath150 and @xmath151 over the loop ) will be very close to unity . from eq.(4.34 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the lorentz contraction factor is @xmath152^{1/2 } \\ .\\ ] ] this is @xmath153 in the matter era , and is of order @xmath154 for tensions of interest ; in the radiation era it is @xmath155 and is of order @xmath156 .",
    "since this factor is so large , we must be careful to recall that the specific definition of length is @xmath157 and so @xmath158 is @xmath18 times the rest frame length @xmath159 .",
    "it is equal to twice the inverse period of the loop in the frw rest frame .    to see one effect of the boost , in ref .",
    "@xcite the total stochastic gravitational wave spectrum from small loops was considered .",
    "the frequency spectrum simply scales inversely as the size of the loops if they are at rest , @xmath160 . in the frw rest",
    "coordinate this frequency is reduced by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "however , the large boost pushes essentially all of the radiation into the forward direction , where the frequency is enhanced by a factor @xmath161 .",
    "thus the gravitational radiation spectrum corresponds to an effective loop size @xmath162 this is @xmath163 in the matter era , meaning that @xmath164 . in the radiation era @xmath165 , meaning that @xmath166 .",
    "we should note that ref .",
    "@xcite considered the sensitivity in the whole @xmath167 plane , and we are simply highlighting one line in this plane .",
    "it is notable that advanced ligo is more sensitive than lisa to these smallest loops , because their small size puts them above the lisa frequency range .",
    "in fact , for interesting values of the tension the loops will produce a periodic signal in the ligo frequency band , which may be observable at advanced ligo  @xcite .      finally , let us discuss how these small loops might fit into the overall picture of the string network . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that loop production from long strings diverges ( as measured by total string length ) at small sizes . to match the scaling value for the rate of long string loss to loops we would need to cut this divergence off at @xmath168 ; this is small in the sense of being an order of magnitude below the horizon length , but very large compared to the scales that we have discussed thus far .",
    "however , the emission of loops from long strings does not end the story , since the divergent loop production continues on the large loops themselves .",
    "we were unable to go further analytically , but conjectured that loops would fragment extensively until they reached a non - self - intersecting configuration at a scale we guessed to be a few orders of magnitude smaller , @xmath169 to @xmath170 .",
    "this appeared to be consistent with the simulations of refs .",
    "if this were the case then the gravitational radiation smoothing that we have discussed would be largely irrelevant , because loop production would already be cut off at much larger scales .",
    "however , refs .",
    "@xcite have recently been able to simulate over longer time scales , and argue for a rather different picture .",
    "namely , they find two populations of loops , one of which scales at @xmath171 , and a second which remains at the simulation cutoff length .",
    "they argue that @xmath3 is the actual loop size , and that the small loops are a transient effect in the simulations and will not be present in the real networks .",
    "we would argue that this interpretation of the small loops as transients is implausible .",
    "first , there is no sign in refs .",
    "@xcite that the total fraction of string length going into the small loops is diminishing in time .",
    "second , if this were a transient effect then its natural time scale should be small in proportion to the size of the loops . instead",
    ", these loops are still being produced after several hubble times , showing that some longer - distance process is continuing to feed the small loop production .",
    "indeed , we have identified this mechanism already  @xcite : the small scale structure on long strings and large loops , which originates at the horizon length and then is carried down to smaller relative lengths by the expansion of the universe , leads to production of loops on arbitrarily small scales .",
    "thus we are led to suggest the following picture .",
    "after a large loop is formed , production of smaller loops continues near its cusp regions . in the end",
    ", there is a large loop without cusps or self - intersections , reduced in size by the excision of the cusp regions .",
    "there is also a population of much smaller loops ; based on the non - scaling seen thus far  @xcite , we conjecture that these will be at the gravitational radiation length .",
    "inspection of fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that as much as 80% of the total string length goes into the small loops , with 20% remaining in the large loop .    as has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3 loops produce a much larger stochastic background than in previous network scenarios , tightening existing bounds and increasing the potential for discovery .",
    "if these loops represent only a fraction of the total string length then this effect is reduced . for loops produced and decaying during the radiation era ,",
    "the total energy density today is proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "thus , if only 20% of the string length goes into large loops , the bound on @xmath2 is weaker by a factor of 25 .",
    "for example , the pulsar timing bound @xmath173 for reconnection probability @xmath174 , shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , would be weakened to @xmath175 , very close to the current cmb bound  @xcite .",
    "foreseeable improvements in pulsar timing , e.g.  @xcite , will improve the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude in @xmath2 .",
    "our work also allows us to address an old question , the interplay between the small scale structure and the cusps  @xcite .",
    "a cusp arises when the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 cross on the unit sphere  @xcite .",
    "the _ size _ of the cusp is the inverse of the ` velocity ' of the functions @xmath176 when they cross , their rate of change with respect to the length along the string .",
    "now , the average velocity of these functions on the long strings is ( going again to the gauge @xmath177 ) @xmath178 where @xmath179\\ , [ b_\\chi ( 1+\\chi)(1 + 2\\chi ) ] ^{2(\\chi - 1)(1 + 2\\chi ) } \\label{v2}\\ ] ] takes the value 0.006 in the matter era and 0.008 in the radiation era .    on the long strings in the network , if the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 were smooth and varied on the scale of the correlation length ( which is not far below the horizon scale ) , then the typical velocity of any crossing would be the inverse correlation length , and this would be the size of cusps . what we see from eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) is that such slow crossings and large cusps are impossible .",
    "superimposed on the slow motion is the irregular motion from the short distance structure ,",
    "so all crossings occur at the much larger velocity @xmath180 , and all cusps have a size of order @xmath181 which is very much smaller than the correlation length .",
    "effectively each large cusp breaks up into a large number of small cusps : the high fractal dimension of @xmath150 and @xmath151 above the gravitational radiation length , noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , implies that these curves will cross many times near the would - be large cusp .",
    "we can estimate the number : the total length of each curve @xmath182 during one hubble time is @xmath183 .",
    "the total number of crossings is roughly the total length of either path divided by the solid angle @xmath184 of the sphere , and so up to numerical factors it is large to the same extent that the size of each cusp is small .",
    "we could also imagine course graining , looking at the string with a resolution @xmath185 that is longer than the gravitational radiation scale , and the same argument would imply @xmath186 cusps each of size @xmath187 .",
    "recall further that the cusp region is the site of rapid loop production , so these small cusps will actually end up on small loops , disconnected from the long string .",
    "it might seem paradoxical that the cusp size  ( [ cusps ] ) is parametrically larger than the loop size  ( [ lsize ] ) , but this is another lorentz effect : in the loop rest frame these sizes are of the same order .    regarding the large loops ,",
    "we have already noted that these are likely to form without cusps .",
    "however , when they eventually decay by gravitational radiation at @xmath188 , the higher harmonics will decay more rapidly , smoothing out the string and likely leading to new cusps .",
    "thus there is the possibility of a cusp signal  @xcite from these , although it will be reduced to the extent that the large loops represent only a fraction of the total loop length .",
