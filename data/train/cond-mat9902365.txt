    "the study of collective excitations in bounded two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) is a subject of current interest , especially for the particular geometry called quantum dot in which a number of electrons is confined into a rather small , almost two - dimensional region produced by present available etching technologies , and for the quasi - one - dimensional structures called quantum wires ( see for example refs . for a comprehensive description of quantum dots and wires ) .",
    "less effort has been put in the investigation of these excitations in quantum antidots , i.e. , the reversed structure of dots made in the 2des@xcite .",
    "recently , magnetoplasmons arising in ring confining geometry have also attracted some interest .",
    "the first experimental studies concerned structures in the micron scale , etched into a molecular - beam - epitaxy - grown @xmath0-doped gaas - ga@xmath1al@xmath2as heterostructure , of outer diameter @xmath3 50 @xmath4 m and inner diameter in the 12 - 30 @xmath4 m range .",
    "the observed magnetoplasmon resonances@xcite bear some of the properties of the dynamical response of a classical 2des@xcite .",
    "later on , a hydrodynamic theory based on the thomas - fermi - dirac - von weizscker approximation has been used@xcite to describe @xmath5 = 400 electron rings which yields a good account of the experimental data after an appropiate scaling of them at zero magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "plasmon modes in very narrow rings have been described within a hartree@xmath7random phase approximation@xcite , and the charge density response of a dot with a repulsive impurity in its center has also been worked out@xcite .",
    "the optical absorption and inelastic scattering of a two electron quantum ring of a rather large radius ( 480 nm ) and width ( 20 nm ) has been discussed in detail@xcite , and single electron properties of quantum rings with parabolic confinement have been discused@xcite , with the aim of determining the effect of electron - electron interactions on the energy spectrum and magnetic moment associated with the persistent current in a quantum ring@xcite .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir ) charge density excitation ( cde ) appears to depend on the ring width .",
    "the measured cdes@xcite are bundled into a high energy group and a low energy group , which in contradistinction with the case of dots do not merge at @xmath6 = 0 .",
    "the low energy peaks arrange into two distinct branches . for narrow ( nr ) rings , both have a negative @xmath6 dispersion , whereas for broad ( br ) rings one branch displayes a positive @xmath6 dispersion at small magnetic fields .",
    "the high energy peaks arrange into one ( narrow rings ) or several ( broad rings ) branches .",
    "the high energy branches display a negative @xmath6 dispersion at small magnetic fields .",
    "the low energy peaks have been explained as edge magnetoplasmons excited at the inner and outer boundaries of the ring@xcite , whereas the high energy peaks are bulk magnetoplasmons@xcite .",
    "it is worth to recall that in the case of antidots , only one edge magnetoplasmon is detected whose energy goes to zero with @xmath6@xcite .",
    "it thus seems that the observed ring plasmons exhibit features of either dots or antidots depending on the ring widthness and @xmath6 value .",
    "very recently , nanorings in inas - gaas heterostructures have been fabricated in the 15 - 40 nm radius range@xcite , and the fir response has been measured for a two electron ring@xcite .",
    "two sets of peaks appear in the response , as in the case of microrings .",
    "depending on the @xmath6 value , one to three main peaks have been detected and arranged into four energy branches with @xmath6 dispersions which seem to differ from the microring systematics@xcite .",
    "the two branches starting from the @xmath6 = 0 high energy peak are similar to those of quantum dots , and according to the analysis of the experimental data presented in ref . , the two branches corresponding to the low energy peaks seem to display both a positive @xmath6 dispersion .",
    "it is worth to notice that the experimental results on microrings cover a low @xmath6 range ( up to 2 t ) , whereas the ones on nanorings extend up to 14 t , but no data on the low energy nanoring peaks have been recorded below 4 t.    the studied nanorings present an elongation in the [ 1,-1,0 ] direction .",
    "likely , it is not distorting much the electrons from being circularly distributed .",
    "otherwise , one would have that at @xmath6 = 0 the two high energy branches do not merge at all , as they seem to do .",
    "a similar situation , namely , a non circularly symmetric dot hosting quite a circularly symmetric electronic density is also found for few electron quantum dots@xcite . besides , during their manufacture nanorings had to be further covered to complete the necessary layer structure@xcite .",
    "all that might result in nontrivial changes with respect the cde s of a ` clean ' , circularly symmetric ring , and it calls for a microscopic investigation in which the basic ingredients for a proper description of such nanostructures are taken into account and might guide the experimental analysis as a kind of ` reference spectrum ' obtained under controled geometrical conditions .",
    "we present here three such spectra obtained within time - dependent local - spin density functional theory ( tdlsdft ) .",
    "the first two correspond to circularly symmetric nanorings made of 12 and 22 electrons embedded into a gaas - ga@xmath1al@xmath2as heterostructure . although the method can handle a smaller number of electrons , the possibility of describing the two electron structure@xcite is beyond its reach and for that reason we have renounced to it from the start , presenting only results obtained for a 5 electron nanoring of equal size as a third example .",
    "it is dobtless that the natural evolution of the field will make it possible a quantitative comparison between tdlsdt and experimental results still to come .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss in sect .",

    "these values have been selected to roughly have in both rings the same average surface densities as in the @xmath5 = 25 quantum dot described in refs . , as well as the same outer radius .",

    "in the case of the nr ring , the electronic density has no structure , presenting a gaussian - like shape whose width decreases with increasing @xmath6 . in contradistinction , in the br ring an incipient bulk density region appears as well as the characteristic ` bump ' at the edges clearly visible in dots confined by a disk geometry@xcite",

    "the @xmath5 = 12 ring becomes fully polarized between @xmath6 = 2 and 3 t , and the @xmath5 = 22 ring between @xmath6 = 3 and 4 t ( in the @xmath5 = 25 quantum dot@xcite it happens at @xmath50 t ) .",
    "it can be seen from the corresponding panels in these figures that at @xmath6 = 0 both rings have a @xmath8 component of the total spin different from zero , @xmath51 = 1 . since the @xmath5 = 10 and 20 rings are close shell systems",
    ", this means that hund s first rule is obeyed by these small rings , as it is in small dots@xcite .",
    "the sp energies are arranged into bands which are bent upwards at both ends not only at low @xmath6 .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the ring geometry , which bears simultaneously the characteristics of dot and antidot bands , the former ones bending upwards at high @xmath49 , and the later ones at small @xmath49@xcite .",
    "the existence of two bendings when a magnetic field is applied is the microscopic origin of the two edge magnetoplasmons , as we shall discuss in the next section .",
    "when the ring becomes fully polarized , increasing @xmath6 further produces the displacement as a whole of the set of occupied sp levels to higher @xmath49 s .",
    "we have found that this is the mechanism rings have to keep its total orbital angular momentum @xmath52 increasing with @xmath6 .",

    "this is a rather narrow region , a few tenths of tesla wide@xcite because after fully polarization the magnetic field is very effective in promoting electrons from high to higher @xmath49 sp levels , reconstructing the dot edge . in rings",
    "this is quite not so because the existence of an electron depletion at the center and the consequent upwards bending of the sp bands allows for an alternative mechanism to keep increasing @xmath52 while retaining the simplicity of the gs wave function , namelly , a slater determinant made of the lowest possible @xmath49 sp states from a minimum @xmath59 to a maximum @xmath60 such that @xmath61 .",

    "it might well happen that for quantum rings , no equivalent of a kind of edge reconstruction mechanism exists , but addressing this point is beyond the capabilities of the density functional we are using .",

    "the cde s displayed in these figures are easier to understand starting from the high @xmath6 results and having in mind the sp levels drawn in figs .",

    "first notice that as in dots , the ( + ) low energy modes are intraband cde s from the outer ring boundary .",
    "the ( @xmath114 ) low energy modes are intraband cde s of the inner ring boundary , obviously absent in dots .",
    "however , they are the only edge modes in antidots@xcite .",
    "the ( + ) modes arise when the dipole field changes by + 1 the total @xmath52 of the ring , and the ( @xmath114 ) ones when this change is @xmath115 .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show than indeed , both kind of _ edge _ modes are possible in rings .",
    "the higher energy peaks are bulk modes arising from interband transitions . at moderate @xmath6 values , both positive and negative high energy peaks are present in the strength , but at high @xmath6 values only modes excited by @xmath113 have an appreciable intensity : as in the dot case , the ( + ) low energy edge mode is taking all the strength corresponding to the @xmath116 operator .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that for some @xmath6 values , the sp energies are distributed following a very symmetric pattern as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "this is the reason why sometimes ( + ) and @xmath117 edge modes are nearly degenerated .",
    "their splitting is not regular as a function of @xmath6 , indicating a kind of ` shell structure ' effect that only a microscopic model can reveal .",
    "still , the gross features of the three energy branches displayed in fig . [ fig7 ] is very similar to that of narrow microrings@xcite : two low energy edge modes with a negative @xmath6 dispersion , and a high energy mode which at low @xmath6 has a negative dispersion , and eventually a positive @xmath6 dispersion at high magnetic fields .    at zero magnetic field , or generally speaking , at low @xmath6 , the cde s are delocalized as in the case of quantum dots .",
    "notice for instance that ( + ) and ( @xmath114 ) excitations are degenerated , and it has no sense to associate any of them to excitations coming from the inner or outer ring boundary . besides , in the case of br rings the low @xmath6 strength in rather fragmented , rendering more complex the analysis .",
    "it is worth to recall that a similar fragmentation occurs in the case of dots if one uses a positively charged disk to model the confining potential@xcite .",
    "still , two quite distinct structures , one at high and another at low excitation energies are present at @xmath6 = 0 in the case of rings , whose origin can be traced back from the results at high @xmath6 , and one may associate the low energy peaks to intraband and the high energy peaks to interband transitions .    in the br ring case ,",
    "the @xmath6 dispersion of the ( @xmath114 ) edge mode is firstly positive , reaches a maximum at around @xmath6 = 1 t , and then becomes negative .",
    "the high energy peaks with appreciable strength are now only ( @xmath114 ) modes . again",
    ", these features are those displayed by broad microrings .    for quantum dots and rings of similar size and electron number ,",
    "one expects that the energy of the @xmath6 = 0 mode is lower for the ring than for the dot . actually , this is a experimental fact@xcite that we can qualitatively explained using a sum rule method .",

    "the fir response of br rings have also some features in common with antidots , which we recall that at @xmath124 basically comes from the @xmath113 component of the dipole operator .",
    "one is the @xmath6 dispersion of the inner edge mode .",
    "the other one is the transfer of stregth from the low to the high energy ( @xmath114 ) peak@xcite .    in all cases",

    "[ fig10 ] below ) . in the longitudinal spin case ,",
    "the residual interaction is attractive but weak , as it is only due to the exchange - correlation potential . as an example",

    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the charge density strength function at several @xmath6 values , and fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the sp energy levels .",
    "basically , the results are qualitatively similar to those of the broad nanoring already discussed ( they have the same @xmath126 ratio ) .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , it can be clearly seen the transfer of strength between the edge and bulk ( @xmath114 ) branches as @xmath6 increases , quite similar to the antidot case as we have already pointed out .",
    "the transfer is possible because both branches have the same polarization .",
    "the coupling is very inefficient in narrow rings , and the ( @xmath114 ) high and low energy peaks keep their own strength .",
    "this is the situation displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the @xmath5 = 12 ring .",
    "it is worth to notice the evolution with @xmath6 of the ( @xmath114 ) edge mode , which is a rather high energy mode with a positive @xmath6 dispersion from @xmath6 = 1 to 4 t , and whose energy abrupty falls between 4.5 and 5 t. this decreasing is due to a change in the occupied sp levels which illustrates the relevance of shell effects especially in the case of a small number of electrons .",
    "a look at the panels corresponding to @xmath6 = 2 and 5 t in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] explains the effect .",
    "it can be seen how asymmetrically are distributed the sp levels , with a much large energy difference for the e - h pairs contributing to the edge excitation of the inner ring boundary than for those building the edge excitation of the outher boundary .",
    "this explains the large energy of the ( @xmath114 ) edge excitation up to @xmath127 4.5 t. of course , this is a qualitative argument since the residual e - h interaction has a sizeable effect in the charge density channel . on the contrary , and @xmath6 = 5 t and above",
    ", the sp levels are distributed more symmetrically , the e - h energy differences are smaller and the ( + ) and ( @xmath114 ) edge modes follow the br ring systematics .",
    "in this work we have studied in some detail cde s in quantum rings . we have confirmed the expectations put forward by dahl et al@xcite that plasmon resonances in quantum rings are dominated to a large extent by geometric effects , although shell effects may cause , in the case of few electron nanorings , effects that can not be systematized .",
    "apart form an example , we have restricted our analysis to cde s .",
    "it would be as simple to describe sde s and spe s within tdlsdt , much along the case of quantum dots@xcite , if experimental information becomes available .",
    "our work complements the theoretical description of microrings made by zaremba@xcite .",
    "even if a kind of characteristic pattern can be established for narrow or broad nanorings , this confining geometry allows to study much richer spectra than in dots or antidots .",
    "it might then offer the possibility of testing theoretical descriptions that are equally well describing plasmon modes in quantum dots , even if their complexity is quite different .",
    "the lack of experimental results for nanorings hosting several electrons has not allowed us to make a quantitative comparison of our calculations with experiments . a qualitative comparison between the calculated @xmath5 = 5 and the measured @xmath5 = 2 fir spectrum@xcite is inconclusive .",
    "to unambiguously arrange the peaks into branches and disentangle the @xmath6 dispersion of the plasmon modes , it would be essential to experimentally assign the polarization state to the main energy peaks .",
    "this has been paramount in the analysis of the theoretical fir response , which otherwise would have not allowed us to distinguish between peak fragmentation and different plasmon branches in some cases .",
    "alternatively , calculations for rings with as many electrons as in the experiments might guide to distribute the experimental data into branches .",
    "tdlsdt may be a useful tool for doing so in nanorings with a few more electrons than those studied so far .",
