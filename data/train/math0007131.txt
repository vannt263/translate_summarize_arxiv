    "the relation between the geometry of a riemannian manifold and the spectrum of its laplace operator acting on functions ( or more generally , on differential forms ) , has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "this is the question how shape and sound of a space are related .",
    "a beautiful introduction into this topic can be found in @xcite .",
    "when one passes from this `` bosonic '' theory to `` fermions '' , i.e.  when turning to spinors and the dirac operator , a new object enters the stage , the _ spin structure_. this is a global topological object needed to define spinors .",
    "the question arises how this piece of structure , in addition to the usual geometry of the manifold , influences the spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "it has been known for a long time that even on the simplest examples such as the 1-sphere the dirac spectrum does depend on the spin structure .",
    "we will discuss the 1-sphere , flat tori , 3-dimensional bieberbach manifolds , and spherical space forms in some detail .",
    "for these manifolds the spectrum can be computed explicitly . for some of these examples an important invariant computed out of the spectrum",
    ", the @xmath0-invariant , also depends on the spin structure . on the other hand , under a certain assumption , the difference between the @xmath0-invariants for two spin structures on the same manifold must be an integer .",
    "hence the two @xmath0-invariants are not totally unrelated .",
    "we also look at circle bundles and the behavior of the dirac spectrum under collapse .",
    "this means that one shrinks the fibers to points .",
    "the spin structure determines the qualitative spectral behavior .",
    "if the spin structure is projectable , then some eigenvalues tend to @xmath1 while the others essentially converge to the eigenvalues of the basis manifold . if the spin structure if nonprojectable , then all eigenvalues diverge .    in most examples",
    "it is totally hopeless to try to explicitly compute the dirac ( or other ) spectra .",
    "still , eigenvalue estimates are very often possible .",
    "so far , these estimates have not taken into account the spin structure despite its influence on the spectrum .",
    "the reason for this lies in the essentially local methods such as the bochner technique . in order to get better estimates taking the spin structure into account one",
    "first has to find new , truly spin geometric invariants .",
    "we discuss some of the first steps in this direction . here",
    "the _ spinning systole _ is the relevant spin geometric input .",
    "finally we look at noncompact examples in order to check if the continuous spectrum is affected by a change of spin structure .",
    "it turns out that this is the case .",
    "there are hyperbolic manifolds having two spin structures such that for the first one the dirac spectrum is discrete while it is all of @xmath2 for the other one .",
    "the influence of the spin structure could hardly be any more dramatic .",
    "_ acknowledgements .",
    "_ it is a pleasure to thank b.  ammann , m.  dahl , and f.  pfffle for helpful discussion .",
    "let us start by collecting some terminology and basic facts . a more thorough introduction to the concepts of spin geometry can e.g.  be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 denote an @xmath4-dimensional oriented riemannian manifold with a spin structure @xmath5 .",
    "this is a @xmath6-principal bundle which doubly covers the bundle of oriented tangent frames @xmath7 of @xmath3 such that the canonical diagram @xmath8 \\ar[r ]         & p \\ar[d ] \\ar[dr ] & \\\\ { p_{\\rm\\scriptsize { \\mbox{\\rm so}}}m}\\times { \\mbox{\\rm so}}(n )   \\ar[r ]    & { p_{\\rm\\scriptsize { \\mbox{\\rm so}}}m}\\ar[r ] & m } \\ ] ] commutes .",
    "such a spin structure need not exist , e.g.  complex projective plane @xmath9 has none .",
    "if @xmath3 has a spin structure we call @xmath3 a _ spin manifold_. the spin structure of a spin manifold is in general not unique . more precisely , the cohomology @xmath10 of a spin manifold acts simply transitively on the set of all spin structures .",
    "given a spin structure @xmath5 one can use the spinor representation @xmath11 to construct the associated _ spinor bundle _",
    "@xmath12 over @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath13 is a hermitian vector space of dimension @xmath14}$ ] on which @xmath6 acts by unitary transformations .",
    "hence @xmath12 is a hermitian vector bundle of rank @xmath14}$ ] .",
    "sections in @xmath12 are called _ spinor fields _ or simply _ spinors_. note that unlike differential forms the definition of spinors requires the choice of a spin structure .",
    "the levi - civita connection on @xmath7 can be lifted to @xmath5 and therefore induces a covariant derivative @xmath15 on @xmath12 .",
    "algebraic properties of the spinor representation ensure existence of _ clifford multiplication _ @xmath16 satisfying the relations @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the riemannian metric .    the _ dirac operator _ acting on spinors",
    "is defined as the composition of @xmath15 with clifford multiplication .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath22 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath23 , then @xmath24 the dirac operator is a formally self - adjoint elliptic differential operator of first order .",
    "if the underlying riemannian manifold @xmath3 is complete , then @xmath25 , defined on compactly supported smooth spinors , is essentially self - adjoint in the hilbert space of square - integrable spinors .",
    "general elliptic theory ensures that the spectrum of @xmath25 is discrete if @xmath3 is compact and satisfies weyl s asymptotic law @xmath26}\\cdot{\\mbox{\\rm vol}}(m)}{(4\\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2 } } \\cdot\\gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)}.\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the number of eigenvalues whose modulus is @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the series @xmath29 converges for @xmath30 if the real part of @xmath31 is sufficiently large . here",
    "summation is taken over all nonzero eigenvalues @xmath32 of @xmath25 , each eigenvalue being repeated according to its multiplicity .",
    "it can be shown that the function @xmath33 extends to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane and has no pole at @xmath34 .",
    "evaluation of this meromorphic extension at @xmath34 gives the @xmath0-invariant , @xmath35 if @xmath3 is complete but noncompact , then @xmath25 may also have eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity , cumulation points of eigenvalues , and continuous spectrum .",
    "in order to demonstrate the dependence of the dirac spectrum on the choice of spin structure the circle @xmath36 can serve as a simple but nonetheless illustrative example . since the frame bundle @xmath37 is trivial we can immediately write down the trivial spin structure @xmath38 . note that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the associated spinor bundle is then also trivial and 1-dimensional .",
    "hence spinors are simply @xmath41-valued functions on @xmath42 .",
    "the dirac operator is nothing but @xmath43 elementary fourier analysis shows that the spectrum consists of the eigenvalues @xmath44 with corresponding eigenfunction @xmath45 , @xmath46 . since the spectrum is symmetric about zero , the @xmath0-series , and in particular , the @xmath0-invariant vanishes , @xmath47 from @xmath48 we see that @xmath42 has a second spin structure .",
    "it can be described as @xmath49\\times{\\mbox{\\rm spin}}(1))/\\sim$ ] where @xmath50 identifies @xmath51 with @xmath52 while it interchanges the two elements of @xmath53 .",
    "let us call this spin structure the _ nontrivial spin structure _ of @xmath42 .",
    "spinors with respect to this spin structure no longer correspond to functions on @xmath42 , i.e.  to @xmath52-periodic functions on @xmath2 , but rather to @xmath52-anti - periodic complex - valued functions on @xmath2 , @xmath54 this time the eigenvalues are @xmath55 @xmath56 , with eigenfunction @xmath57 .",
    "again , the spectrum is symmetric about @xmath51 , hence @xmath58 .",
    "vanishing of the @xmath0-invariant is in fact not surprising .",
    "one can show that always @xmath58 for an @xmath4-dimensional manifold unless @xmath59 mod @xmath60 .",
    "the example @xmath42 has shown that the eigenvalues of the dirac operator definitely do depend on the choice of spin structure .",
    "even the dimension of the kernel of the dirac operator is affected by a change of spin structure . for the trivial spin structure of @xmath42",
    "it is 1 while it is zero for the nontrivial spin structure .",
    "we conclude this section with a remark on extendability of spin structures because this sometimes causes confusion . if @xmath3 is a riemannian spin manifold with boundary @xmath61 , then a spin structure on @xmath3 induces one on @xmath61 . to see this consider the frame bundle @xmath62 of the boundary as a subbundle of @xmath7 restricted to the boundary by completing a frame for @xmath61 with the exterior unit normal vector to a frame for @xmath3 . now",
    "the inverse image of @xmath62 under the covering map @xmath63 defines a spin structure on @xmath61 .",
    "look at the case that @xmath3 is the disc with @xmath42 as its boundary .",
    "since the disk is simply connected it can have only one spin structure .",
    "hence only one of the two spin structures of @xmath42 extends to the disc .",
    "the tangent vector to the boundary @xmath42 together with the unit normal vector forms a frame for the disk which makes one full rotation when going around the boundary one time .",
    "it is therefore a loop in the frame bundle of the disk whose lift to the spin structure does not close up .",
    "thus the induced spin structure on the boundary is the nontrivial spin structure of @xmath42 while the trivial spin structure does not bound .",
    "hence from a cobordism theoretical point of view the trivial spin structure is nontrivial and vice versa .",
    "the case of higher - dimensional flat tori is very similar to the 1-dimensional case .",
    "there are @xmath64 different spin structures on @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a lattice in @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a basis of @xmath66 , let @xmath69 be the dual basis for the dual lattice @xmath70 .",
    "spin structures can then be classified by @xmath4-tuples @xmath71 where each @xmath72 indicates whether or not the spin structure is twisted in direction @xmath73 .",
    "the spectrum of the dirac operator can then be computed :    [ torus ] the eigenvalues of the dirac operator on @xmath65 with spin structure corresponding to @xmath74 are given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 runs through @xmath70 and each @xmath76 contributes multiplicity @xmath14 - 1}$ ] .",
    "again the spectrum depends on the choice of spin structure .",
    "in particular , eigenvalue @xmath51 occurs only for the trivial spin structure given by @xmath77 . since again the spectrum is symmetric about zero , the @xmath0-invariant vanishes , @xmath58 , for all spin structures .",
    "this changes if one passes from tori to more general compact connected flat manifolds , also called _",
    "bieberbach manifolds_. they can always be written as a quotient @xmath78 of a torus by a finite group @xmath79 . in three dimensions , @xmath80 , there are 5 classes of compact oriented bieberbach manifolds besides the torus .",
    "their dirac spectra have been calculated by pfffle @xcite for all flat metrics .",
    "this time one finds examples with asymmetric spectrum and the @xmath0-invariant depends on the choice of spin structure .",
    "the tables show that hyperbolic 2- or 3-manifolds of finite volume with one end behave like compact ones , the dirac spectrum is always discrete .",
    "a surface with two or more ends always admits both types of spin structures .",
    "this is not true for 3-manifolds .",
    "discrete spectrum is always possible but the case @xmath83 only sometimes . if the hyperbolic 3-manifold is topologically given as the complement of a link in @xmath84 ( and this construction is one of the main sources for hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume ) , then this question can be decided .",
    "the condition on the linking numbers is very easy to verify in given examples .",
    "since we compute modulo 2 orientations of link components are irrelevant .",
    "if the link is given by a planar projection , then modulo 2 , @xmath94 is the same as the number of over - crossings of @xmath91 over @xmath92 .",
    "the complements of the following links possess a hyperbolic structure of finite volume .",
    "all linking numbers are even .",
    "hence the dirac spectrum on those hyperbolic manifolds is discrete for all spin structures .",
