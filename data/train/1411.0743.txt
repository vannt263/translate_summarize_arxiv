    "in the past few decades , a series of attractive achievements in the quantum information field have been made . quantum computation and quantum communication",
    "will no longer be a dream @xcite . in quantum communication",
    ", there are some important protocols have been proposed , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum state sharing @xcite , quantum secure direct communication @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "photon is the best candidate to carry and distribute quantum information , because it has fast transmission speed and is easy to control .",
    "unfortunately , the unavoidable absorption and scattering in a transmission quantum channel places a serious limitation on the length of the communication distances @xcite .",
    "the photon loss becomes one of the main obstacles in long - distance quantum communication .",
    "it not only decreases the efficiency of the communication , but also will make the communication insecure , because the detection loophole @xcite .    during the past decades , people developed two powerful quantum technologies to resist the photon loss .",
    "the first quantum technology is the quantum repeaters @xcite . by dividing the whole channel into several segments ,",
    "they first generate the entanglement in each segment . finally , by entanglement swapping , they can set up the entanglement in the whole distance .",
    "the second quantum technology which will be detailed in this paper is the quantum state amplification . though the quantum repeater can extend the entanglement between the adjacent segments , they still require to distribute entanglement in each short - distance segment . in this way , during the transmission",
    ", the photons will lose with some probability . briefly speaking",
    ", the photon loss will cause the single photon @xmath0 degrade to a mixed state as @xmath1 , which means the photon may be completely lost in the probability of @xmath2 .    in 2009 ,",
    "ralph and lund first proposed the concept of the noiseless linear amplification ( nla ) to distill the new mixed state with relatively high fidelity from the input mixed state with low fidelity @xcite . since then , various nla protocols have been proposed @xcite .",
    "current nla protocol can be divided into three groups .",
    "the first group focused on the single photon @xcite .",
    "the second group focused on the single - photon entanglement ( spe ) @xcite , for the spe is the simplest entanglement form , but it has important applications in cryptography @xcite , state engineering @xcite , tomography @xcite , entanglement purification @xcite , entanglement concentration @xcite , the third group focused on the continuous variables systems @xcite .",
    "for example , in 2012 , osorio _ et al .",
    "_ experimentally realized the heralded noiseless amplification for the single - photon state ( sps ) with the help of the single - photon source and the linear optics @xcite .",
    "_ demonstrated the heralded noiseless amplification of a photon polarization qubit @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also proposed an nla protocol for protecting the spe @xcite .",
    "so far , all the existing nla protocols for the sps and spe can only be performed for one time . that is the fidelity of the initial state",
    "can be increased for one step . in the practical high noisy applications ,",
    "the photon loss is usually high . in this way , after performing the amplification protocol , the quality of the entanglement may not reach the standard for secure and highly efficient long - distance quantum communication . because in order to close the detection loophole , the fidelity of the state is the higher the better . in this way",
    ", we should seek for the efficient approach to realize the amplification . in this paper , based on the linear optics",
    ", we propose an efficient nla protocol for protecting both the sps and spe , respectively . in our protocol",
    ", the amplification is cascaded . that is the fidelity of the sps and spe",
    "can be increased step by step .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the cascaded nla protocol for sps . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our cascaded amplification protocol for spe . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a discussion .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "v , we present a conclusion .",
    "before we start to describe our protocol , we first introduce the basic principle of the nla protocol , based on the work of gisin _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "it is composed of the variable fiber beam splitter ( vbs ) with the transmittance of @xmath3 and the 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "the schematic drawing is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the mixed state of the sps can be described as @xmath4    in ref.@xcite , an auxiliary single photon is required .",
    "the auxiliary photon passes through the vbs , which can generate a single - photon entangled state as @xmath5 where the coefficient @xmath6 is @xmath7 the success probability of the protocol is @xmath8        we denote the amplification factor @xmath9 , so that we can obtain @xmath10 in order to realize the amplification , it is required that @xmath11 .",
    "it can be calculated that we can obtain @xmath11 only if @xmath12 .    in the section",
    ", we put forward an efficient cascaded amplification protocol for the sps with the help of the nla unit .",
    "we first describe the two - level cascaded nla protocol , as described in fig .",
    "2 . from fig.2 , we require two single photons @xmath13 and @xmath14 as auxiliary .",
    "after one of the single - photon detectors @xmath15 or @xmath16 registers one photon , the state in the spatial mode @xmath17 must be an amplified mixed state of the form in eq.([new1 ] ) . in this way",
    ", the new mixed state can be regarded as the initial state in the second amplification , with the help of another auxiliary single photon @xmath14 . in the second round",
    ", we still choose the case that only one of the single - photon detectors @xmath18 or @xmath19 register the photon .",
    "if the protocol is successful , we can obtain a new mixed state as @xmath20 with @xmath21    it is straightforward to extend this two - level cascaded nla protocol to the arbitrary level cascaded nla protocol , as described in fig .",
    "3 . in the protocol",
    ", we make the input photon pass through n nla units , successively . the output photon state from the previous nla unit enter the next nla unit as the input one .",
    "the transmittance of the vbs in each nla unit is required to meet @xmath12 . with the help of",
    "n auxiliary photons , say a@xmath22 , a@xmath23 , @xmath24 a@xmath25 , the initial sps can be cascaded to amplify for n time .        based on the description in sec .",
    "ii , after n nla unit , we can obtain the output new mixed photon state as @xmath26 the @xmath27 is the fidelity of the output mixed state after nla@xmath25 .",
    "we can calculate the fidelity of the mixed state after the photon pass through each nla unit as @xmath28    after nla@xmath25 , we define the total amplification factor g as @xmath29 under the case that the transmittance of each vbs meet @xmath12 , we can ensure arbitrary @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , increasing the number of nla unit ( @xmath31 ) can effectively increase the fidelity of the final output sps . especially ,",
    "if @xmath32 , we can make @xmath33 .",
    "meanwhile , the success probability to distill the new mixed state after each nla can be written as @xmath34,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdots\\cdots&\\nonumber\\\\ p_{n}&=&p_{n-1}[t+\\eta_{n-1}-2\\eta_{n-1}t].\\label{p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    obviously , as arbitrary @xmath35 , increasing the number of the nla unit will reduce the success probability . therefore , it is a trade - off between the fidelity and the success probability . in order to obtain the sps with high fidelity , we need to consume large number of the input single photons .",
    "in 2012 , the setup of nla described in ref .",
    "@xcite was developed to amplify spe @xcite , which is shown in fig .",
    "2 . briefly speaking",
    ", a single - photon source s emits single - photon entangled state , which is in the spatial mode @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the form of spe can be written as @xmath38        for realizing the amplification , two auxiliary photons are required and both the two parties need to run the same operation as described above , simultaneously .",
    "after the amplification , we can obtain the new mixed state as @xmath39 with the success probability of @xmath40 the fidelity of the new mixed state is @xmath41 interestingly , it can be found that the form of the fidelity in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) is the same as that in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can also obtain that when the transmittance of each vbs meets @xmath12 , the amplification factor @xmath11 .        in the section , the nla unit will be used to realize the cascade amplification for the spe state . as shown in fig .",
    "5 , due to the environmental noise , alice and bob share a mixed state as eq .",
    "( [ entangle ] ) . for realizing the amplification , each of them needs to prepare n nla units , say nla@xmath22 , nla@xmath23,@xmath24 nla@xmath25 , and nla@xmath42 , nla@xmath43 , @xmath24 nla@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "each of alice and bob makes the single photon in his / her hand pass through the n units , simultaneously .",
    "similarly , during the amplification process , each of them needs to introduce n auxiliary photons , say b@xmath22 , b@xmath23 , @xmath24 b@xmath25 , and b@xmath42 , b@xmath43 , @xmath24 b@xmath44 . after the n nla units , we can obtain the final output quantum state as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fidelity of the mixed state when both the input photons from alice and bob pass through n nla units .",
    "we can also calculate the fidelity and success possibility of the cascaded amplification protocol for the spe state .",
    "the fidelity of the mixed state when both the two parties make the input photon pass through arbitrary n nla units can be written as @xmath47 where the subscript `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' , @xmath24 `` n '' mean the number of the nla units adopted by each of the two parties .",
    "similarly , it can be found eq .",
    "( [ fidelity2 ] ) has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ fidelity1 ] ) .    therefore , when both the two parties make their photon pass through n nla units , the total amplification factor @xmath48 is the same as eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) . in this way , under the case that @xmath12 , we can effectively increase the amplification factor by increasing the number of the nla units .    certainly , we can also calculate the success probability of the cascaded amplification protocol as @xmath49,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdots\\cdots&\\nonumber\\\\ p_{n}'&=&p_{n-1}'[(1 - 2\\eta_{n-1}')t^{2}+\\eta_{n-1 } ' t],\\label{p2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' , @xmath50 `` n '' are the number of the nla units used in each of the two parties .",
    "similarly , increasing the fidelity will also sacrifice the success probability . for obtaining the spe with high fidelity , we still need to consume large amount of initial input state .",
    "so far , based on the work of refs.@xcite , we have fully described our cascaded nla protocol for both sps and spe .",
    "the nla unit which is composed of the vbs and bs , is the key element of the two protocols . in our protocol , we make the target photon pass through n nla units , successively . under the case",
    "that the transmittance of the vbs ( @xmath3 ) meets @xmath12 , when the target photon pass through a nla unit , we can realize an amplification with the help of an auxiliary photon . in this way , by making the photon pass through n nla units successively , we can finally realize n cascaded amplification .",

    "meanwhile , we suppose that both the two protocols are operated under low initial fidelity ( @xmath51 ) , medium initial fidelity ( @xmath52 ) , and high initial fidelity ( @xmath53 ) .",
    ", width=566 ]    according to eq .",
    "( [ fidelity1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ fidelity2 ] ) , the fidelity ( @xmath27 ) of the output mixed states largely depends on the initial fidelity ( @xmath54 ) of the input state , the transmittance ( @xmath3 ) of the vbs , and the number ( @xmath31 ) of the nla unit .",
    "6 shows @xmath27 as a function of @xmath3 . for comparison",
    ", we suppose the protocols are operated under low initial fidelity ( @xmath51 ) , medium initial fidelity ( @xmath52 ) and high initial fidelity ( @xmath53 ) , respectively , and make n=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . the fidelity curve of the protocols in ref .",
    "@xcite is the same as that for @xmath55 .",
    "it can be found that @xmath27 reduces with the growth of @xmath3 .",
    "the five curves in each figure interact at the point of @xmath56 . under the case that @xmath56 , @xmath57 , that is , the output mixed state is the same as the input state .",
    "actually , when @xmath56 , the vbs become the bs , the whole amplification process is converted to the standard teleportation process . on the other hand , increasing the number of the nla unit can effectively increase the fidelity of the output states , especially under low initial fidelity condition . in practical applications , the photon loss is usually high .",
    "7 shows the the fidelity @xmath27 altered with @xmath31 under practical high photon loss condition ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "it can be found that when @xmath58 , @xmath6 is only 0.5 , while @xmath59 can reach 0.996 .",
    "therefore , by selecting the suitable vbs and the suitable value of n , we can make @xmath33 . in this way",
    ", our protocols may provide an effectively way to close the detection loophole in qkd @xcite .",
    "certainly , we should point out that though the @xmath27 increases with @xmath31 , we can not reach @xmath60 .",
    "the limitation of @xmath61 .",
    "that is the @xmath60 is a fixed point for the iterative equations in both eq .",
    "( [ fidelity1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ fidelity2 ] ) . on the other hand , under high photon loss condition ( @xmath51 ) , the protocols in refs .",
    "@xcite can obtain relatively high fidelity only under the extreme condition that @xmath62 .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath55 , @xmath6 is 0.69 under @xmath63 , and @xmath6 can reach 0.96 under @xmath64 . in current experimental conditions ,",
    "the vbs with @xmath65 is unavailable .",
    "however , with the growth of @xmath31 , the requirement for @xmath3 is largely reduced .",
    "for example , when @xmath66 , @xmath59 can reach 0.996 under @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , it is much easier for us to obtain high fidelity under practical experimental conditions .     altered with the iteration number @xmath31 .",
    "here we let @xmath67 and the initial fidelity @xmath51.,width=226 ]    finally , we will discuss the experimental realization of our protocol .",
    "the vbs and bs are the key elements .",

    "can be easily realized under current technology . in our protocol , the processing of the photons passing through the bs is essentially the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference , so that the two photons should be indistinguishable in every degree of freedom .",
