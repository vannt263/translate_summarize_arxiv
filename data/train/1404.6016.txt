    "in the recent experimental and theoretical studies , it has been revealed that a variety of cluster structures appear in various stable and unstable nuclei in a wide mass - number region ( for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . as predicted in ikeda s threshold rule @xcite , remarkable cluster structures with spatial development",
    "have been suggested in excited states near the threshold energy .",
    "interestingly , in neutron - rich nuclei , various cluster states containing exotic clusters have been suggested : he+he cluster states in be isotopes @xcite , @xmath8be+@xmath1 states in @xmath9c @xcite , @xmath9c+@xmath1 states in @xmath10o and their mirror states @xcite , @xmath10o+@xmath1 states in @xmath11ne @xcite , @xmath4li+@xmath5he states in @xmath12b @xcite , @xmath5he+@xmath7 states in @xmath4li @xcite , and so on .    for direct evidence of clusters in nuclei ,",
    "the cluster decay width is a probe to confirm the cluster structure in resonance states .",
    "theoretically , conventional cluster models such as the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite and the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite have been applied to study typical cluster structures in light stable nuclei such as the @xmath1+@xmath1 structure in @xmath3be and the @xmath0o+@xmath1 structure in @xmath2ne , and they have succeeded to describe cluster decay widths of resonance states @xcite .    as the variation of constituent clusters becomes richer in unstable nuclei than the well - known cluster structures in stable nuclei , conventional cluster models based on the assumption of specific clusters such as @xmath1 and @xmath0o are no longer applicable for new cluster states having exotic clusters as @xmath7 , @xmath5he , @xmath3he , @xmath8be , @xmath9c , and @xmath10o .",
    "for such exotic clusters , it is important to take into account cluster polarization , breaking , and formation as well as effects of channel coupling . for cluster study of unstable nuclei , many extended frameworks such as antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) methods @xcite , and extended cluster models of the stochastic variational method @xcite , the gcm method , and the generalized two - center cluster model @xcite have been developed .",
    "one of the advantages of the amd method is that the framework does not rely on the assumption of any clusters .",
    "nevertheless the model wave function can describe various cluster structures as well as one - center structures expressed by a shell - model configuration as the formation and dissociation of clusters are automatically obtained in the energy variation .",
    "the method has been applied to stable and unstable nuclei and proved to be useful for study of cluster structures in general nuclei . in spite of the flexibility of the amd wave function ,",
    "its application to cluster decay widths is very limited .",
    "one of the main origins for the difficulty is that internal wave functions of exotic clusters are generally more complicated than typical clusters which can be often expressed by a simple shell - model configuration .",
    "in such a case , it needs a large numerical cost to describe the details of asymptotic inter - cluster wave functions mainly because superposition of wave functions is needed in describing exotic clusters .",
    "the fmd framework , whose wave function is quite similar to the amd one , has been applied to a scattering problem by neff _",
    "@xcite , but , the application is limited only to very light nuclei . in many works of cluster structures with the amd method ,",
    "cluster resonance states are often described in a bound state approximation and their widths are hardly discussed .",
    "our aim is to estimate cluster decay widths by measuring the cluster probability at the surface for general @xmath13-body wave functions containing exotic clusters or non - cluster components . according to the @xmath14-matrix theory of nuclear reaction ,",
    "the cluster decay width is given by the reduced width amplitude ( rwa ) at a channel radius where the interaction and the antisymmetrization effect of nucleons between clusters vanish .",
    "the method with the rwa is often used to estimate the cluster decay width in traditional cluster models within a bound - state approximation .",
    "it means that if one has a reliable value of the rwa in an @xmath13-body wave function , it is able to estimate the cluster decay width following the rwa method as done in cluster models . however , to extract the rwa for exotic clusters from a total wave function",
    ", one may encounter another problem because it is not obvious how to separate the partial - wave inter - cluster wave function and cluster internal wave functions under the antisymmetrization operator of nucleons between clusters .",
    "instead , it is easier to calculate the norm overlap of the total wave function with the reference cluster wave functions where clusters are localized around a certain position rather than to directly extract the rwa . even for exotic clusters described by rather complicated configurations , the calculation of the norm overlap is usually feasible . in the region of our interest where the effect of antisymmetrization of nucleons between clusters is negligible",
    ", the norm overlap indicates the cluster probability at a certain channel radius and it should relate to the rwa .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple method to approximately calculate the rwa at the surface region using the norm overlap with the reference cluster wave function .",
    "to check the validity of the present approximation of the rwa , we compare the approximated rwa with the exact rwa in the well - known cluster states ; @xmath0o+@xmath1 in @xmath2ne and @xmath1+@xmath1 states in @xmath3be in the traditional cluster - gcm calculations .",
    "we also make similar analysis for the @xmath2ne wave functions with the mixing of non - cluster components obtained with the amd method .",
    "we show the applicability of the present approximation to discuss the @xmath1-decay widths of cluster resonance states in @xmath2ne and @xmath3be . as an example of application to neutron - rich nuclei",
    ", we apply the present method to @xmath4li and discuss the partial width of @xmath7 decay from the @xmath5he+@xmath7 cluster resonances suggested in the previous work in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in the next section , we explain the conventional cluster - gcm model with brink - bloch ( bb ) cluster wave functions , and describe the rwa and its relation to the decay width in the cluster model . the method to approximately calculate the rwa",

    "the method of the approximated rwa does not work because the antisymmetrization effect of nucleons between clusters is rather strong and the norm overlap with a bb wave function does not directly indicate the @xmath1 cluster probability at the certain position .",

    "therefore , we reject @xmath203 if it is less than a half of the maximum amplitude in the applicable region .",

    "it was found that the approximated rwa for the cluster states near the threshold energy is in good agreement with the exact rwa in the outer region . using the approximated rwa , we estimated the @xmath1-decay width in the bound state approximation and showed that the method is useful to discuss the @xmath1-decay width of resonance states .",

    "in the present work , we apply the present method to systems consisting of simple cluster wave functions given by h.o . configurations .",
    "the proposed method is based on the norm overlap with a cluster wave function localized around a certain distance @xmath93 which can be rather easily calculated than the exact inter - cluster wave function . therefore , the present method is efficient and it is applicable to systems consisting of more complicated cluster wave functions .",
    "for instance , it may be feasible to evaluate the @xmath1 decay width of the @xmath8be+@xmath1-cluster states , which has been theoretically suggested in excited states of @xmath9c @xcite .",
