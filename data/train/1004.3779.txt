    "several dedicated efforts have recently been proposed to describe optical photon transport in scintillator detectors using various monte carlo packages  @xcite . using the geant4 ( version 4.9.1 patch 3 ) framework  @xcite ,",
    "we have constructed a comprehensive and detailed model of photon transport in plastic scintillator , then used the model to study the individual nemo-3 calorimeter modules . in the model",
    ", we account for the wavelength dependence of optical properties of the scintillators , light guides , reflective wrappings , photodetectors and coupling materials .",
    "we use wavelength dependent self - absorption and re - emission in the scintillator and account for the fluorescent quantum yield of the wavelength shifter .",
    "our results show that this detailed modeling exhibits better agreement with measurements compared to a monochromatic approach .    the nemo-3 experiment , located at the laboratoire souterrain de modane in the frjus tunnel , searches for neutrinoless double beta decay by employing tracking and calorimetry systems and has been taking data since 2003  @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter modules consist of large polystyrene scintillator blocks with light guides coupled to either flat or hemispherical photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "signals in an individual block are due to incident particles , mostly @xmath1 and @xmath2 rays , and the response varies with the energy and the impact point on the entrance face .",
    "the response also depends on the size and geometry of the blocks .",
    "the energy resolution and background rejection improves if a correction for the non - uniformity due to the impact position is applied for each type of employed blocks  @xcite .",
    "we have reproduced the spatial dependence of response of the nemo-3 scintillators to @xmath0 conversion electrons and have optimized the new scintillator block geometry for the next generation double beta decay experiment , supernemo .",
    "nemo-3 calorimeter modules  @xcite were manufactured to conform to the overall cylindrical geometry of the detector .",
    "each module faces the isotopic foil ( a source of double beta transitions ) and is composed of a scintillator block , a light guide , and a @xmath3 or @xmath4 pmt . the detector is azimuthally divided into 20 identical wedge sectors , each assembled as a tracker and calorimeter with a source foil , as depicted in figure  [ figure : blocks3d ] .",
    "the scintillators hermetically cover the two cylindrical walls which surround the foil and the tracking volume .",
    "there are three types of blocks comprising the walls and there is also partial scintillator coverage of the top and bottom end - caps . on the interior wall ,",
    "there are two in blocks which are mirror - symmetric . on the exterior wall , there are two types of blocks : center ( ec ) and edge ( ee ) type blocks , with ee blocks symmetrically placed on either side of an ec block . the dimensions of these scintillator blocks are given in table  [ table : blocks ] .",
    "simulations of the response of these three types of blocks was the primary objective of our work reported here .",
    "the scintillator material is composed of polystyrene ( ps ) ( 98.49% by weight ) , a primary dopant p - terphenyl ( ptp ) ( 1.5% by weight ) and a wavelength shifter 1,4-bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl ) benzene ( popop ) ( 0.01% by weight ) .",
    "the light guides are made out of polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) and serve as the interface between the pmts and the scintillators .",
    "five layers of @xmath5 thick teflon ribbon are wrapped around the four side walls of each scintillator and two layers of single - sided @xmath6 thick aluminized mylar foil are wrapped around the entrance face .",
    "one layer of double - sided @xmath7 thick aluminized mylar foil is wrapped around the other five faces to protect against light produced by geiger discharge in the tracking region .",
    "bicron bc600 optical glue with a nominal thickness of @xmath8 is used to couple the light guides to the scintillator blocks .",
    "0.05 in    .types and dimensions of nemo-3 inner and outer wall scintillator blocks .",
    "the blocks were made at the joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr ) in dubna , russia .",

    "we have used our simulations to facilitate a scintillator choice for the supernemo experiment  @xcite . supernemo further plans to exploit the nemo-3 technique of tracking and calorimetry .",
    "the new modular detector would incorporate about @xmath9 of @xmath10se , @xmath11nd , or @xmath12ca , to reach neutrinoless double beta decay half - life sensitivity of about @xmath13 years .",
    "this goal requires that the new experiment significantly improves its energy resolution with respect to nemo-3 .",
    "we have been conducting r&d and the developed simulation code is an important aid in our studies of the choice of materials , block shape and size , wrapping , and light collection .",
    "a baseline provisional design for the supernemo calorimeter calls for a hexagonal block with a proposed circumscribed radius of @xmath14 made out of polyvinyltoluene ( pvt ) scintillator ( e.g. , eljen ej-200  @xcite ) coupled to a super - bialkali @xmath15 hemispherical pmt ( e.g. , hamamatsu r5912-mod ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : supernemo_drawing ] shows a drawing of the proposed supernemo scintillator module including the scintillator , pmt , and mounting brackets .",
    "the light yield of the pvt scintillator is taken to be 10,000 photons per mev  @xcite .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the pmt was taken to be approximately 33% at @xmath16  @xcite ] .",
    "we propose a high reflectivity aluminized mylar from reflectech  @xcite around the sides and entrance face of the scintillator block and a teflon wrapping on the top face near the pmt .",
    "similar to nemo-3 , we assume an air gap of @xmath17 between all block faces and the mylar wrapping .",
    "our simulations show that with this configuration , assuming nemo-3 scintillator absorption and emission , a resolution of @xmath18 ( fwhm ) at @xmath19  @xcite is expected . using the symmetry of the block , each sixth of the hexagonal face",
    "is divided into 16 regions .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : supernemo_resolution ] , the energy resolution is fairly uniform across the face of the block .",
    "the mean energy resolution is 7.19% ( fwhm ) at @xmath19 and the minimum and maximum is 7.14% and 7.24% , respectively .",
    "recently conducted preliminary measurements confirm our predictions  @xcite .",
    "we have constructed a geant4-based spectral model of nemo-3 and supernemo calorimeter blocks and compared the results of simulations with measurements of single electrons from @xmath0 sources . the measured energy resolution and spatial dependence for the blocks",
    "were demonstrated to be in good agreement with simulations .",
    "the ec blocks show a doubly - symmetric distribution of response about the center of the block while the ee blocks show a symmetric distribution about the z - axis , both in agreement with observations . for the supernemo block ,",
    "the main elements improving the resolution over the nemo-3 blocks are the 25% increase in scintillator light yield , the 35% increase in the pmt quantum efficiency , the larger pmt size , and the incorporation of the high reflectivity aluminized mylar .",
    "additionally , by directly coupling the scintillator and pmt , we render light guides unnecessary which further improves the transparency and response uniformity .",
    "as expected , including the spectral properties of all materials and incorporating wavelength - shifting absorption and emission with the effects of fluorescent quantum yield in the scintillator improves the agreement of modeling with measurements .",
    "our approach is necessary for a detailed understanding of high resolution plastic calorimeters .",
    "the importance of these spectral simulations increases with distances travelled by photons so such models are necessary to study large - scale scintillator detectors .",
