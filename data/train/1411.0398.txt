    "the study of differential equations in a general riemannian space involves investigation of equations containing arbitrary parameters or arbitrary functions .",
    "this naturally leads to the group classification problem of differential equations .",
    "the first group classification problem was carried out by ovsiannikov @xcite who classified all forms of the non - linear heat equation @xmath0 .",
    "studies related to group properties of non - linear wave equations began with the well - known paper of ames @xcite in 1981 . since then the group classification problem has been studied intensely for fundamental equations arising from models in engineering and physics , e.g. the symmetry classification of the geodesic equations of riemannian spaces @xcite , the symmetry classification of the two and three dimensional newtonian systems damianou2d , damianou3d , tsam2d , tsam3d and many others @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a symmetry analysis of wave equation in a power - law bianchi iii spacetime spacetime can be found in @xcite and a symmetry analysis of the wave equation on static spherically symmetric spacetimes , with higher symmetries , was recently carried out in @xcite    in @xcite , it was proved that for a linear , in the derivatives , second order partial differential equation ( pde ) the lie point symmetries are related with the conformal algebra of the geometry defined by the pde .",
    "one important equation which belongs to this type of pdes is the klein gordon equation @xmath1where @xmath2 is the laplace operator defined in terms of the metric of the riemannian space .    in @xcite",
    "the generic lie symmetry vector for the klein gordon equation in a riemannian space has been found and it has been expressed in terms of the elements of the conformal algebra of the space modulo a constraint relation involving the lie symmetry vector and the potential entering the klein gordon equation .    concerning the noether point symmetries of the klein gordon equation in a riemannian space we prove that these are the same as the lie point symmetries of this equation .",
    "these geometric results transfer the problem of the lie / noether symmetry classification of the klein gordon equation ( [ kg.eq1 ] ) in a riemannian space to the problem of determining the ckvs of the space and the appropriate potentials which solve the corresponding constraint condition .",
    "we note that taking the potential @xmath3 this classification provides , as a special case , the corresponding symmetry analysis for the wave equation in bianchi i spacetimes",
    ".    these results can be useful in two ways . using the reduction of the klein gordon equation by means of certain lie point symmetries",
    "one determines invariant solutions of ( [ kg.eq1 ] ) with respect to these symmetries .",
    "furthermore because the lie symmetries are also noether symmetries one is able to determine conserved currents for the corresponding potential .",
    "we apply these general results in bianchi i spacetime and perform the complete group classification of the lie /noether point symmetries of klein gordon equation in this spacetime in terms of the potential @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ premil ] provides the geometrical preliminaries and the theoretical background . in section lienkg , we give the explicit form of the generic lie symmetry vector of the klein gordon equation in a general riemannian space in terms of the conformal algebra of the space modulo a constraint condition involving the potential . in section [ kgbianchi ]",
    "we obtain the symmetry classification for the klein gordon equation in bianchi i spacetimes and the corresponding potentials .",
    "furthermore , in section [ invariant ] the lie point symmetries are applied in order to reduce the klein gordon equation and determine invariant solutions .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] we draw our conclusion and we discuss the symmetry analysis of the wave equation .",
    "in this section we give the basic definitions and properties of the collineations of spacetime and of the point symmetries of differential equations .      a collineation in a riemannian space is a vector field @xmath5 which satisfies an equation of the form@xmath6where @xmath7 is the lie derivative with respect to the vector field @xmath5 , @xmath8 is a geometric object ( not necessarily a tensor ) defined in terms of the metric and its derivatives and @xmath9 is an arbitrary tensor with the same indices as the geometric object @xmath10 the collineations of riemannian spaces have been classified by katzin et.al .",

    "becomes@xmath85which means that @xmath86 is a ckv of the metric @xmath19 and that @xmath87 however since the noether point symmetries are also lie point symmetries , from ( kgt.01 ) we have that @xmath88 ; where @xmath89",
    ". then condition ( [ kgl.06 ] ) becomes@xmath90this equation is an identity hence the coefficients of the various powers of @xmath91 must vanish .",
    "it follows then that @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the noether condition becomes @xmath94which is the lie point symmetry condition ( [ kgt.02 ] ) . we conclude that every lie point symmetry ( but not the trivial vector field @xmath95 , since @xmath92 ) of the klein gordon equation is also a noether point symmetry for the lagrangian ( [ kgl.01 ] ) .",
    "therefore we have the following theorem    [ kgnoether]the noether point symmetries of the klein gordon lagrangian ( [ kgl.01 ] ) are generated by the ckvs of the metric @xmath19 .",
    "the generic noether point symmetry vector is the lie generic point symmetric vector with @xmath92 and corresponding gauge function@xmath96where @xmath97 is a function which satisfies the condition @xmath98    from noether s theorem the function @xmath97 can be absorbed in the noether flow , hence without loss of generality we can set @xmath99 .",
    "theorem [ kgnoether ] is a generalization of the result of @xcite for the klein gordon equation with constant potential , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , from theorem [ kgnoether ] we have the following corollary which relates the dimension of the algebras of lie and noether point symmetries of the klein gordon equation .",

    "in order to apply the results of theorems [ kg ] and [ kgnoether ] we need the complete conformal algebra of bianchi i  spacetime .      the bianchi type @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) models are spatially homogeneous spacetimes which admit a group of motions @xmath108 @xcite acting on spacelike hypersurfaces",
    ". some  of these spacetimes are non - isotropic generalizations of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time such as the bianchi i , v and ix spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes have been used in the discussion of anisotropies in a primordial universe and its evolution towards the observed isotropy of the present epoch .",
    "the simplest type of these spacetimes are the bianchi i models which correspond to the abelian group @xmath108 consisting of the three kvs @xmath109 in synchronous coordinates the metric of this spacetime is @xmath110where @xmath111 are functions of the time coordinate @xmath112 only .    when the metric functions @xmath111",
    "satisfy certain relations it is possible that the resulting bianchi i spacetimes admit a larger conformal algebra . in @xcite it has been shown that these spacetimes can be classified in two sets a. the bianchi i  spacetimes which are non - conformally flat ( which we refer as class a ) and b. the bianchi i spacetimes which are conformally flat ( which we refer as class b ) . in more formal terms the first family contains the petrov type i  spacetimes and the second family the petrov type d spacetimes .    before we proceed",
    "it will be useful if we clarify the following point .",
    "from theorem [ kg ] we have that in order the klein gordon equation ( bkg.03 )  to admits lie /noether point symmetries in a riemannian space _ two _ conditions must be satisfied :    \\a .",
    "the metric has to admit a non - void conformal algebra , which is always the case because all bianchi i metrics admit the three kvs @xmath113    \\b .",
    "the potential @xmath114 must satisfy the constraint condition ( [ kgt.02 ] ) or ( [ kgt.04 ] ) depending on the dimension of the space i.e. @xmath66 or @xmath71 respectively .",
    "this means that for each ckv of the conformal algebra of bianchi ispacetimes given in @xcite we must solve condition ( [ kgt.02 ] ) ( because @xmath115 ) and find those potentials for which it is satisfied . in other words",
    "the constraint condition ( [ kgt.02 ] ) acts as a double selection rule selecting for each ckv a corresponding potential or , if this is not possible , abandoning the ckv for being a lie point symmetry of the klein gordon equation .",
