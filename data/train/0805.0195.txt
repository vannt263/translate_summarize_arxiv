    "classical waves propagating in heterogeneous media have been subject to increasing interest during the last thirty years . because diffuse waves show complex waveforms due to the randomness of the medium , they have long been considered to be devoid of any deterministic information .",
    "additionally , it is well established that conventional images ( obtained with ultrasounds , radar , seismic waves ... ) are degraded when scattering increases .",
    "nevertheless , mesoscopic physicists have demonstrated the existence of various wave phenomena that survive , and even develop , in the presence of multiple scattering @xcite . this mesoscopic approach has led to an incredible number of applications in optics , acoustics , oceanography @xcite , and even seismology @xcite .",
    "such applications take advantage of multiple scattering to image , to communicate through , or to monitor heterogeneous media .",
    "+ field - field correlation and passive imaging is a more recent idea that strongly benefits from the above developments .",
    "the idea is that the correlation of fully diffuse wavefields recorded at two sensors yields the green s function between them as if one sensor was a source .",
    "the connection between correlations and the green s function is not new and can be derived from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "but more recently , weaver and lobkis @xcite proposed another original approach that uses diffuse waves to reconstruct the exact impulse response between two sensors .",
    "their experiments were followed by an amazing breakthrough in seismology @xcite , where earthquakes are not controlled but sensors easily handled .",
    "+ in practical applications like seismology , we mostly focus our effort on the reconstruction of direct ( ballistic ) waves within an array of receivers .",
    "such a reconstruction is not trivial to obtain : correlations include the green s function , plus fluctuations that are not easily washed out .",
    "these remnant fluctuations corresponds to the difference between correlations obtained after perfect and after imperfect averaging .",
    "these fluctuations , also named _",
    "pseudo - noise _ in the following manuscript , eventually reduce under time and source averaging . note that here ,",
    "the _ pseudo - noise _ is contained in the correlations and blurs the green s function , this is different from the _ ambient noise _ constituted by natural vibrations used as input data for the correlations  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to compare the level of _ pseudo - noise _ to the level of the perfectly averaged correlation ( the _ signal _ )",
    ". the _ signal _ and _ pseudo - noise _ terminology is chosen here by analogy to active source - sensor experiments .",
    "for simplicity , we name signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) the ratio between the level of _ signal _ in the correlations and the level of _ pseudo - noise_.    in practical applications , estimating the level of _ signal _ and _ pseudo - noise _ in the correlations is a central issue .",
    "on the one hand , one has to evaluate the minimum amount of data needed to perform some passive images : how many sources to employ , what is the necessary record duration , what distance is best between receivers ...",
    "? on the other hand , it would be a waste of time to acquire and process an excess of data if the _ signal_-to-_pseudo - noise _ ratio ( snr ) in the correlation is satisfying for less .",
    "this snr quantifies the convergence of the correlations toward the green s function .",
    "different theories have been developed in helioseismology @xcite and acoustics @xcite to describe the convergence with respect to the time of integration @xmath1 , the number of sources @xmath2 , the distance between receivers @xmath3 , the frequency @xmath4 and bandwidth @xmath5 of the recorded signal .",
    "these theoretical approaches assume stationary wave fields , and are particularly adapted to ambient noise records . what about non - stationary records , like coda waves ?",
    "theoretical and experimental works have demonstrated that multiple scattering plays a central role in the time- and space- symmetry of the correlations @xcite .",
    "another point is now to quantify how multiple scattering affects the convergence of correlations . given a set of sources and receivers , we will see how multiple scattering improves the estimations of the green s function obtained by correlations . in the present article",
    ", we will propose a prediction for the snr that could be used prior to an experiment .",
    "the formulation that we will derive applies to non - stationary wave fields .",
    "our theoretical model will quantitatively describe how an increasing multiple scattering improves the convergence of the correlations .",
    "+ in section  ii of the present manuscript , we show an example of green s function reconstruction in a multiply scattering medium , using finite difference simulations .",

    "the effective time length of one record is similar to the thouless time : @xmath119    therefore we would expect the snr to grow like : @xmath120    on the one hand , scattering increases the thouless time @xmath121 , thus increasing the snr . on the other hand , the direct wave is attenuated by scattering .",
    "these two effects are in competition . for the direct wave , we can approximate the attenuation by the product of the geometrical spreading and the diffusion attenuation . for simplicity , we also assume that @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding snr then writes :    @xmath123 which formally means that the snr increases with increasing scattering if @xmath124 .",
    "again , this formal result is a central point of our article .",
    "note that according to this equation , the snr saturates , then decreases for strong scattering or large distances ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is due to the scattering attenuation of the reconstructed green s function ( in the correlation ) .",
    "the best snr is therefor expected for @xmath126 .",
    "in the present article , we correlated diffuse waves to reconstruct the green s function between passive sensors .",
    "this processing was carried out without any transformation of the raw record @xmath14 .",
    "the only modification that we realized was normalising each couple @xmath127 by the maximum of @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , we did not change the frequency content of the records ( no whitening ) , nor change the amplitudes of particular waveforms within @xmath14 .",
    "this has the virtue of reconstructing the green s function both in phase and amplitude . practically speaking",
    ", this allowed us to retrieve the geometrical spreading of the wave , along with the absorption , and confirms the possibility of mapping the attenuation of the medium under investigation `` without a source '' . nevertheless , in most practical applications",
    ", the amplitude of the raw records @xmath14 is strongly modified .",
    "several non - linear transformations have been proposed in the literature : 1-bit processing ( retain only the sign )  @xcite , adaptive gain constant ( dynamic renormalization that compensate the coda decay ) , clipping  @xcite , to cite only a few . in our model",
    ", this would be more or less equivalent to compensate the decay of @xmath68 , thus increasing the snr .",
    "on the one hand , these latter processing were shown to greatly improve the final tomographic images : they are particularly adapted when the phase ( arrival time ) of the wave transports the quantity of interest , like in tomography . on the other hand ,",
    "these processing are likely to degrade the reconstruction of the amplitude , as it was observed in more recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we therefore strongly suggest that pre - processing treatments like 1-bit or whitening be used only when the reconstruction of the phase is targeted .",
    "to conclude this article , we have reported on the convergence of correlations toward the green s function in the case of independent sources in a multiple scattering environment . in section",
    "ii , we have presented numerical simulations and retrieved the green s function ( in phase and amplitude ) between passive sensors . as a simple model",
    ", we chose to describe the coda as a superposition of waves arriving at random time .",
    "this offers the opportunity to develop , in sections iii and iv , a simple estimation for the mean and the variance of the correlations , from which a snr is derived .",
    "this snr quantifies the convergence of the correlations toward the green s function .",
    "the snr was found to increase like @xmath129 , where @xmath2 is the amount of sources , @xmath130 is the effective duration of the coda ( the thouless time ) , and @xmath43 represents the duration of the source .",
    "a central point of our paper is that multiple scattering ( large @xmath42 and @xmath121 ) provides a better snr in the correlations .",
    "this results in a fascinating observation : instead of blurring the images as is the case in conventional techniques , disorder here improves the quality of passive images . on the contrary",
    ", absorption was found in section v to reduce the snr and , as always , is a limiting factor . our theoretical model for the snr",
    "was confronted to finite difference numerical simulations .",
    "this model was found to be valid when scattering is limited ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "nevertheless , when scattering is increased , our naive description of coda waves was found to be slightly inappropriate : we point out short- and long - range correlations of diffuse wave paths as a probable candidate to explain the discrepancy between our theoretical model and numerical simulations .",
    "we are grateful to j. de  rosny , l. gizon , r. maynard , l. stehly , p. goudard and c. hadziioannou for fruitful discussions and comments .",
    "the numerical code was provided by m. tanter .",
    "this work was partially funded by an anr grant `` chaire dexcellence-2005 '' .",
    "to evaluate the level of fluctuations in the correlations , we evaluate the variance of the correlations for one source , averaged over the source position .",
    "let s start with a simple calculation , assuming that @xmath14 is gaussian and using the moment theorem :    @xmath132    the first term is the intensity of the correlations . once eliminated , only the variance remains :    @xmath133(\\theta_1-\\theta_2 ) \\left[\\rho \\otimes g_{bb}\\right](\\theta_1-\\theta_2)d\\theta_2d\\theta_1\\\\ + \\iint & \\sigma(\\theta_1 ) \\sigma(\\theta_1+\\tau)\\sigma(\\theta_2)\\sigma(\\theta_2+\\tau )   \\left[\\rho \\otimes g_{ab}\\right](\\theta_1-\\theta_2+\\tau)\\left[\\rho \\otimes g_{ab}\\right](\\theta_2-\\theta_1+\\tau)d\\theta_2d\\theta_1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we replace @xmath134 by @xmath135 : @xmath136(q)\\left[\\rho \\otimes g_{bb}\\right](q )      dqd\\theta_1 \\\\",

    "nevertheless , we can go beyond their work after a series of additional reasonable assumptions .",

    "2 ) the variance @xmath68 of the record evolves with a characteristic time of @xmath42 much greater than the diffuse wave coherence time @xmath43 ( @xmath142 ) , so that @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "3 ) if @xmath145 , then @xmath146 .",
    "these assumptions greatly simplify the above equation that now reads :    @xmath147",
    "we now take into account an averaging over @xmath2 sources , each source is labeled @xmath148 or @xmath149 :    @xmath150    these summations can be split into two contributions @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the first one yields @xmath153 , and directly derives from to the above case n=1 .",
    "the term @xmath152 exhibits cross - correlations @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which are neglected as long as sources are dilute enough .",
    "this term @xmath152 contains short- and long - range correlations .",
    "the short - range correlation in diffuse media takes the usual form of @xmath156 , with @xmath157 the distance between source @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",

    "its role is developed in the next section of the appendix and can not account for the whole discrepancy between observed and theoretical snr .",

    "these latter phenomena will be subject to further investigations .",
    "we evaluate here the number of uncorrelated sources when @xmath2 sources are chosen at random but have are spatially correlated over @xmath158 , which is typically the case inside multiple scattering media ( short - range correlation )  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the choice of @xmath2 locations is random over @xmath159 sites .",
    "the size of the site is deduced from the coherence length of a diffuse field , which result in a coherence area of a source of the form @xmath160 . in the case of a @xmath161 large grid ,",
