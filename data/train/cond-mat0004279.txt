    "one of the most active subfields in condensed matter theory is the development of new algorithms to simulate the many - body problem .",
    "this interest is motivated by various physical phenomena , including high temperature superconductivity , magnetism , heavy fermions and the rich phenomenology occurring in quasi - one dimensional compounds . in the last few years",
    ", important progress has been made .",
    "well - controlled results have been obtained by exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo methods ( qmc)@xcite . however , these algorithms suffer from a common limitation in that the number of degrees of freedom grows rapidly with the lattice size . as a consequence ,",
    "the calculations are restricted to relatively small systems . in most cases ,",
    "the limited size of the system prohibits the study of the low - energy physics of these models .",
    "recently , another route to quantum simulations has been proposed .",
    "following metzner and vollhardt@xcite and mller - hartmann@xcite who showed that in the limit of infinite dimensions , the many - body problem becomes purely local , a mapping to a self - consistent anderson impurity problem was performed @xcite@xcite .",
    "the availability of many techniques to solve the anderson impurity hamiltonian has led to a dramatic burst activity . however , when applied to systems in two or three dimensions this self - consistent approximation , referred to as the dynamical mean field approximation ( dmfa ) , displays some limitations . due to its local nature , the dmfa neglects spatial fluctuations which are essential when the order parameter is non - local .",
    "this is the case in the cuprate or heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "methods that at least include short - range spatial fluctuations are currently the object of intensive research .",
    "these techniques map the lattice problem to a self - consistently embedded finite - sized cluster , instead of a single impurity as in dmfa .",
    "the most promising of these techniques is the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the key idea of the dca is to use the irreducible quantities ( self energy , irreducible vertices ) of the embedded cluster as an approximation for the lattice quantities .",
    "these irreducible quantities are then applied to construct the lattice reducible quantities such as the green function or susceptibilities in the different channels .",
    "the cluster problem is solved by using a generalization of the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the novelty and the new perspectives offered by the dca .",
    "we use the one - dimensional hubbard model as a test case .",
    "we analyze the convergence of the dca in comparison to that of the usual finite systems simulations ( fss ) .",
    "the choice of a one - dimensional model is particularly instructive .",
    "a success of the dca in 1d , where quantum fluctuations are the strongest , means that the method can work in any dimension .",
    "we show that the dca produces results which are complimentary to those obtained by fss .",
    "cluster cells ( shown by different fill patterns ) that partition the first brillouin zone ( dashed line ) .",
    "each cell is centered on a cluster momentum @xmath0 ( filled circles ) . to construct the dca cluster , we map a generic momentum in the zone such as @xmath1 to the nearest cluster point @xmath2 so that @xmath3 remains in the cell around @xmath0 . ]",
    "the dca is based on the assumption that the lattice self energy is weakly momentum dependent .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the dynamical intersite correlations have a short spatial range @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the linear dimension of the cluster .",
    "then , according to nyquist s sampling theorem@xcite , to reproduce these correlations in the self energy , we only need to sample the reciprocal space at intervals of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we could approximate @xmath7 by @xmath8 within the cell of size @xmath9 ( see , fig .",
    "[ bz ] ) centered on the cluster momentum @xmath0 ( wherever feasible , we suppress the frequency labels ) and use this green function to calculate the self energy .",
    "knowledge of these green functions on a finer scale in momentum is unnecessary , and may be discarded to reduce the complexity of the problem .",
    "thus the cluster self energy can be constructed from the _ coarse - grained average _ of the single - particle green function within the cell centered on the cluster momenta : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of points of the lattice , @xmath12 is the number of cells in the cluster , and the @xmath13 summation runs over the momenta of the cell about the cluster momentum @xmath0 ( see , fig .",
    "[ bz ] ) . for short distances",
    "@xmath14 the fourier transform of the green function @xmath15 , so that short ranged correlations are reflected in the irreducible quantities constructed from @xmath16 ; whereas , longer ranged correlations @xmath17 are cut off by the finite size of the cluster.@xcite     leads to the replacement of the lattice propagators @xmath18 , @xmath19 , ... by coarse grained propagators @xmath20 , @xmath21 , ...",
    "( eq .  [ gbar ] ) in the internal legs of @xmath22 , illustrated for a second order diagram . ]",
    "this coarse graining procedure and the relationship of the dca to the dmfa is illustrated by a microscopic diagrammatic derivation of the dca .",
    "for hubbard - like models , the properties of the bare vertex are completely characterized by the laue function @xmath23 which expresses the momentum conservation at each vertex . in a conventional diagrammatic approach @xmath24= n \\delta_{\\k_1+\\k_2,\\k_3+\\k_4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) are the momenta entering ( leaving ) each vertex through its legs of @xmath29 .",
    "however as @xmath30 mller - hartmann showed that the laue function reduces to@xcite @xmath31 the dmfa assumes the same laue function , @xmath32 , even in the context of finite dimensions .",
    "thus , the conservation of momentum at internal vertices is neglected .",
    "therefore we may freely sum over the internal momenta at each vertex in the generating functional @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to a collapse of the momentum dependent contributions to the functional @xmath33 and only local terms remain .",
    "the dca systematically restores the momentum conservation at internal vertices .",
    "the brillouin - zone is divided into @xmath34 cells of size @xmath35 . each cell",
    "is represented by a cluster momentum @xmath36 in the center of the cell .",
    "we require that momentum conservation is ( partially ) observed for momentum transfers between cells , i.e. , for momentum transfers larger than @xmath37 , but neglected for momentum transfers within a cell , i.e. , less than @xmath38 .",
    "this requirement can be established by using the laue function @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a function which maps @xmath1 onto the momentum label @xmath0 of the cell containing @xmath1 ( see , fig .",
    "[ bz ] ) . with this choice of the laue function the momenta of each internal leg",
    "may be freely summed over the cell .",
    "this is illustrated for the second - order term in the generating functional in fig .",
    "[ collapse_dca ] .",
    "thus , each internal leg @xmath41 in a diagram is replaced by the coarse  grained green function @xmath42 , defined by eq .",
    "the diagrammatic sequences for the generating functional and its derivatives are unchanged ; however , the complexity of the problem is greatly reduced since @xmath43 .",
    "we showed previously@xcite that the dca estimate of the lattice free - energy is minimized by the approximation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "one advantage of the dca over other attempts to build self - consistent cluster techniques is that the dca is fully causal .",
    "the spectral weight is conserved and the imaginary part of the single - particle retarded green function and self - energy are negative definite .",
    "hettler et al . used a geometric argument to derive a rigorous proof of the causality of the dca @xcite .      in the dmfa , after convergence , the local green function of the lattice is identical to that of the impurity model .",
    "though in the dca , the coarse - grained green function @xmath46 is equal to the cluster green function , this quantity is not used as an approximation to the true lattice green function @xmath47 . the correct procedure to calculate the lattice physical quantities within the dca is to approximate the lattice irreducible quantities with those of the cluster .",
    "the lattice reducible quantities are then deduced from the irreducible . in order to completely understand the dca formalism",
    ", one must understand why reducible and irreducible quantities are treated differently .",
    "consider a screened particle ( a quasiparticle ) propagating through the system , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ lendca ] . here",
    ", we will assume that the screening length , e.g. , due to thomas - fermi screening , @xmath48 is short .",
    "this screening cloud is described by the single - particle self energy @xmath49 which itself may be considered a functional of the interaction strength @xmath50 and the single - particle propagator @xmath51 .",
    "the different screening processes are described perturbatively by a sum of self energy diagrams . due to the short screening length",
    ", the propagators which describe these processes need only be accurate for lengths @xmath52 . from the fourier uncertainty principle , we know that the propagators at short lengths may be accurately described by a coarse sampling of the reciprocal space , with sampling rate @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase accumulated as the particle propagates through the system is described by the fourier transform of the single - particle green function .",
    "since this accumulated phase is crucial in the description of the quantum dynamics it is important that @xmath54 remain accurate at long length scales , so it should not be coarse - grained as described above .",
    "however it may be constructed from the approximate self energy .",
    "hence , the lattice green function is given by , @xmath55    a similar procedure is used to construct the two - particle quantities needed to determine the phase diagram or the nature of the dominant fluctuations that can eventually destroy the single - particle quasi - particle .",
    "they are computed in the same fashion as the single - particle ones .",
    "the irreducible vertex @xmath56 is the analogue of the self energy for two - particle quantities . in a general many - body theory",
    ", @xmath56 has four entries describing the states of a pair before and after the interaction , @xmath57 the diagonalization of @xmath56 in spin space reduces to the usual density and magnetic fluctuations in the particle - hole channel or singlet and triplet fluctuation in the particle - particle channel . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will use a generic notation below which describes any one of these four fluctuations .",
    "momentum conservation ensures that there are only three independent momenta , @xmath58 .",
    "we assume , as for the self energy , that the irreducible vertex @xmath59 is weakly momentum dependent .",
    "hence , this quantity is equated to the corresponding cluster quantity within a cell surrounding the cluster momentum for each momentum involved in @xmath60 .",
    "this gives , @xmath61    the calculation procedure of the reducible two - particle quantities from the irreducible vertex @xmath56 will now be described .",
    "the qmc cluster susceptibility @xmath62 calculated in the appropriate channel is the analogue of the single - particle green function @xmath63 . but",
    "this quantity is different from the coarse grained susceptibility @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the lattice susceptibility . in the dca , @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "are both related to @xmath56 through the reduced bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath69 @xmath70 represents either @xmath68 or @xmath71 .",

    "[ reimselfu2b5](b ) ,  [ reimselfu4b5](b ) , and  [ reimselfu6b5](b ) , also has a monotonic behavior in which the limiting value is bracketed by fss and dca results .",
    "a general trend that emerges is that @xmath172 has a local minimum in the vicinity of @xmath158 in the metallic regime ( fig .",
    "[ reimselfu2b5 ] ) , which minimum deepens sharply when a pseudogap appears ( fig .",
    "[ reimselfu4b5 ] ) , and finally @xmath173 vanishes in the insulating regime ( fig .",
    "[ reimselfu6b5 ] ) .",
    "we have extensively analyzed the dca by comparing it to fss .",
    "a coherent picture emerges from the investigation of the single - particle properties of the 1d hubbard model . by systematically underestimating the effects of correlations",
    ", the dca converges to the limiting value of a given quantity from a starting point that is opposite to the starting point of fss .",
    "thus , the dca can help resolve situations where one is unable to draw a conclusion from fss alone . for example , in spite of considerable work with fss , it has not been possible to make a definitive statement as to the existence of a pseudogap in the weak - coupling ( u smaller than the band - width ) regime of the two - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "it was impossible to get a definite answer from fss because , as expected , the pseudogap seemed to vanish when the cluster size was increased @xcite .",
    "recently , using dca , huscroft et al .",
    "showed that there is a pseudogap for @xmath174 to @xmath175 clusters @xcite . from the analysis above ,",
    "since the dca underestimates the effects of correlations , this demonstrates unambiguously the existence of the pseudogap in the half - filled hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the dca has shown great promise and , even though a young method , has already illustrated its great utility .",
    "still , much work remains to be done .",
    "one immediate application is the the nature of the ground state of the two dimensional hubbard model ; is it a mott insulator or antiferromagnetic ( slater ) insulator ? another is the problem raised by anderson concerning the low energy behavior of 2d coupled doped hubbard chains ; are they luttinger or fermi liquids ? @xcite both of these problems have proven difficult to tackle using fss approaches alone .",
    "finally , we have not discussed the convergence of the two - particle quantities",
    ". a systematic comparison with fss as in this work will be the subject of a future study ."
