    "the emission of highly energetic ions from solid targets irradiated by intense laser pulses has attracted great attention over the past decades @xcite . the short time scale on which the acceleration occurs along with the small source size enable extremely high ion densities in the mev bunches which could be superior for specific applications @xcite .",
    "however , such high density is only maintained close to the source , it drops quickly due to the angular spread of few tens of degrees @xcite .",
    "such large angles lead to large losses using magnetic quadrupoles @xcite , complicate the beam transport and therefore trigger investigations on sophisticated transportation schemes such as pulsed solenoid@xcite and laser driven micro lenses @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , shaped lens target @xcite , droplets @xcite and curved target @xcite have been used to manipulate the ions angular distribution .",
    "those approaches were mostly based on target normal sheath acceleration ( tnsa ) @xcite with @xmath1 thick targets .",
    "acceleration fields are built at the target rear by the hot electrons generated at the front side of the targets .",
    "the divergence of the ions strongly depends on the electron density and phase space distribution of the electrons behind the target , which is initially related to the laser profile and then disturbed during the transportation through the targets @xcite .",
    "recently , ultrathin foils with thickness down to @xmath2 scale have been investigated experimentally @xcite , enabled by the improvement on the laser temporal contrast .",
    "a divergent ion beam with opening half angle of roughly 10@xmath0 from 50 @xmath2 ultrathin foils can be inferred from @xcite .",
    "proton beams with divergence of 5 - 6@xmath0 have been observed from 800 @xmath2 ch targets @xcite .",
    "these results imply that thinner foils can generate much more collimated ion emission as compared to @xmath1 thick targets .    in this letter , we present the first detail study of the divergence of proton beams accelerated from 5 - 20 @xmath2 thick diamond - like - carbon ( dlc ) foils @xcite .",
    "divergences as low as 2@xmath0 were observed for different foil thickness and irradiation conditions .",
    "the proton beams show a pronounced collimation over the whole energy range .",
    "we attribute the small divergence to a steep longitudinal electron density gradient at the target rear in comparison with @xmath1 thick target , and the collimation feature is related to an exponentially decaying electron density in transverse dimension .",
    "our interpretation is supported by both an analytical model and the two - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , revealing new physics that occur in the interaction of high - intensity laser with nanometer thin targets .",

    "the divergence of the protons decreases with increasing focal spot size on the target when moving the target out of focal plane to both sides beyond the rayleigh length .",
    "the smallest divergence was obtained in the target position of + 100 @xmath1 , which is our example of fig . [ fig2](a),(b ) .",
    "additionally , the total number of protons above 2 mev even increases when enlarging the target positions , i.e. when the divergence reduces , as shown in the inset of fig . [",

    ", @xmath31 is inversely proportional to the square root of the electron density @xmath30 . in the case of @xmath1 thick targets , due to the large angular spread of few 10s of degrees for hot electrons inside the target @xcite ,",
    "@xmath30 drops significantly at the target rear , resulting in a typical @xmath31 of few @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "when the target thickness is reduced from tens of @xmath1 to submicrometer , the influence from electron propagation through the target is suppressed and the angular spread of hot electrons is substantially reduced , altogether resulting in a higher @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , with the reduction of thickness , the recirculation of the hot electrons is enhanced @xcite , which can further increase @xmath30 .",
    "those arguments imply that a small @xmath31 exists at the rear side of thinner targets , which in turn resulting in a small divergence of ions .",
    "when the thickness of the target is down to @xmath2 scale , an additional factor arises ; the pondermotive force pushes a large portion of electrons away from the ions , which further increase the electron density as well as the density gradient , in turn reducing @xmath31 . ultimately in light sail regime , a balance between ponderomotive force and charge separation field is formed , and a dense electron layer pushed by the laser pulse drives the ion acceleration , the acceleration field is confined between two oppositely charged plates within 10s of nm @xcite .    in previous experiments ,",

    "much more low - energetic electrons can penetrate through the nm foil and contribute to the acceleration field .",
    "such low - energy electrons are trapped close to target and reach equilibrium in a short time and form a boltzmann distribution along the transverse dimension as well , leading to a constant divergence as observed in the experiment .    to verify our arguments and analytical model ,",

    "a linearly polarized laser pulse with a gaussian envelope in both the spatial and temporal distribution with a fwhm diameter @xmath44 of 3 @xmath1 and a fwhm duration of 33 fs , is used to replicate the experiment conditions .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows the transverse electron density profile at three different @xmath16 positions behind a 20 nm foil .",
    "indeed , the profiles are found to be well represented by an exponentially decaying profile with a scale length @xmath50 , similar to the radius of laser spot @xmath56 of approximately 1.5 @xmath1 .",
    "[ see fig . [ fig4](a ) ] . the longitudinal density distribution from the simulation in fig . [ fig4](b )",
    "is represented by an exponential function as well .",
    "the density scale length @xmath571/12 @xmath1 , is much smaller than the typical scale length @xmath31 for @xmath1 targets .",
    "such an electron density distribution finally leads to a well collimated proton beam[see fig . [ fig4](c ) ] , in a good agreement with the experimental observation in fig . [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the divergence does not depend on energy , with a constant value of about 2@xmath0 over the whole energy range . by using @xmath50 and @xmath31 from simulation ,",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) gives a half angle of 3.2@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) predicts the reduction of @xmath33 with increasing the transverse scale length of electron distribution @xmath50 , which in the case of ultrathin foils , is related to the laser fwhm diameter @xmath44 , as confirmed by our target position scan[cf .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "although , a precise determination of the values of @xmath50 and @xmath31 accordingly to different @xmath44 is beyond the capacity of our simple model and our laser intensity distribution outside the focal plane is not perfect gaussian , we found that the divergence half angle roughly scales with @xmath13 experimentally , i.e. , @xmath58 .",

    "[ fig5 ] was normalized to the maximum proton energy , where the maximum proton energy is increased from 6 mev to roughly 30 mev by a factor of 5 with higher laser intensity .",
    "our simulation indicates that the divergence depends only weakly on the laser intensity with other parameters unchanged , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the divergence of proton beams generated from ultrathin dlc foils in detail .",
    "we demonstrated well collimated proton beams with divergence half angle as low as 2@xmath0 .",
    "this constitutes the smallest value reported so far and one order of magnitude lower than achieved with @xmath1 targets . as a consequence ,",
    "100 times increase in proton fluence is observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , the proton beams are well - collimated over the complete energy range and can be further optimized by adjusting the focal spot size . those ultrasmall divergence and well collimation is considered as an intrinsic characteristic of @xmath2 ultrathin foils .",
    "we expect these observations to be of particularly interest for applications .",
    "for example , the divergence angle is sufficiently small to enable lossless beam transport utilizing conventional ion optics such as quadrupoles with typically a few @xmath64 acceptance angle @xcite .",
    "more directly , investigations that rely on high proton flux , can benefit from the ultrasmall divergence , possibly enhanced by focusing laser accelerated ions with shaped @xmath2 targets @xcite , a development that is pursued in our laboratory .",
