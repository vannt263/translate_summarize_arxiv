    "pairwise - interacting components in implicit solvent are often used as models of self - assembling systems , such as crystal - forming  @xcite and capsid - forming-  @xcite proteins , and patchy nanoparticles  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall summarize ways of using monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to evolve such components in order to approximate the ( interacting ) brownian motion that their real counterparts execute .",
    "brownian motion is usually approximated in simulations by integration of overdamped equations of motion , called the brownian dynamics ( bd ) method  @xcite , with monte carlo algorithms more often used as a means of sampling thermal distributions .",
    "however , recent work shows that in certain circumstances the mc method can also evolve components according to an approximately correct dynamics .",
    "dynamic mc simulations even offer some advantages over their bd counterparts : it is easier and computationally cheaper to evaluate potentials ( mc ) than forces ( bd ) ; mc can cope with pathological potentials ( e.g. hard particles , abrupt changes in potential ) ; and one does not face problems of numerical instability with mc as one does with bd ( even for smooth potentials ) , and so can make larger basic moves .    in what follows we outline the reasons why single - particle metropolis mc can effect a dynamics close to brownian motion , and we summarize the work of others that makes use of this correspondence .",
    "we then describe extensions of the mc scheme that incorporate explicit moves of collections of particles , and argue that such schemes can be used to preserve the approximate realism of the mc method when collective modes of motion become important to a system s evolution .",
    "we take the view that although mc methods are not dynamically realistic in all details , they offer for some applications a convenient alternative to conventional integration of equations of motion .",
    "it is well - known that sequential moves of single components , proposed in an unbiased fashion and accepted according to the metropolis criterion , permits sampling of the boltzmann distribution given sufficiently long simulation times  @xcite .",
    "however , is also true that if we restrict such moves to local translations and rotations then the dynamics executed by a single particle in an external forcefield is equivalent , in the limit of small trial moves , to a langevin dynamics  @xcite , i.e. to brownian motion in that potential . to see this ,",

    "if this condition holds then metropolis mc moves of single particles in an external potential occur in a dynamically realistic way : the drift velocity of the particle is proportional to the force acting upon it , and its diffusion constant is independent of position .",
    "this correspondence also holds in two and three dimensions .    in most situations we are interested in interacting particles , not isolated particles in external potentials",

    "these arguments are difficult to extend analytically to larger numbers of particles , but they suggest that single - particle metropolis mc can mimic a realistic dynamics a ) if trial moves can be made small enough to render negligible higher - order corrections to particles drift and diffusion coefficients , or b ) if collective diffusive modes of motion do not dominate a system s behavior",
    ". the latter situation might arise if a system is very crowded , and particles are able to move only small distances , or if assembly of a structure is dominated by the addition and detachment of single particles , rather than by cluster - cluster interactions .",

    "metropolis simulations of the crystallization of attractive colloids , in parameter regimes dominated by single - particle attachment and detachment , were found to behave like their brownian counterparts  @xcite . refs .",
    "@xcite even found accord between the long - time equilibrium dynamics of silica computed with metropolis mc and with newtonian ( not overdamped ) dynamics , perhaps because the distinction between diffusive and ballistic dynamics is relatively unimportant in a crowded system .",
    "refinement of the dynamical realism of single - particle mc trajectories can be achieved by rescaling the basic mc timestep by acceptance rate  @xcite , or by biasing the choice of trial moves according to the forces acting on particles  @xcite .",
    "there also exist situations in which collective diffusive modes of motion are important to a system s evolution , and it is inconvenient to make the monte carlo trial step size small enough that a single - particle algorithm can mimic realistic collective diffusion .",
    "such situations can arise if particles interactions change rapidly with distance or angle ( true of e.g. certain model proteins , which might extend several nanometers but interact over distances comparable to a nanometer ) ; if particles are present at low concentration ( because they must cross large distances to interact ) ; and if a system s assembly is naturally hierarchical .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) an example in which all three of these conditions holds .",
    "when faced with such a system , one can restore to a monte carlo scheme a degree of realistic collective motion by making explicit moves of collections of particles .",
    "this is often done by recursively linking particle pairs ( starting , say , with particles @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) with a given probability , and proposing a collective move of the resulting cluster  @xcite .",

    "we then propose a move ( e.g. a translation ) of the cluster .",

    "this rate contains the likelihood of selecting the cluster s displacement or rotation , one factor of @xmath55 for each link formed within the moving cluster , one factor of @xmath56 for each link attempted but not formed within the cluster , and one factor of @xmath56 for each link not formed between the cluster and its environment .",

    "such schemes provide a convenient way to effect collective motion in self - assembling systems  @xcite .",
    "they allow for precise control of collective motion : we know in advance of the move the nature of the cluster to be moved , and we can rotate and translate this cluster as desired . their chief shortcoming , however , is that clusters ( and single particles ) do not move solely according to the potential energy gradients acting on them . because links are conditioned upon energies in the initial microstate , particles interacting strongly are likely to be moved in concert , even if relative moves of these particles are favorable .",
    "the analog of for a static cluster algorithm yields an effective drift velocity for the inter - dimer separation that is not simply proportional to the negative of the potential gradient , but is instead proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "this drift velocity is not consistent with a physical dynamics .",
    "one suggested consequence of such a bias is sketched in fig  [ fig2](a ) : even though rotation of the upper 6 particles might be desirable ( see panel ( b ) ) , if particles interact strongly then a static algorithm would have trouble forming a cluster of those 6 particles that does not include the whole of the structure shown .",
    "simulations  @xcite show that proposing relative moves of strongly - attracting particles less frequently than moves of weakly - attracting particles can lead to dynamical trajectories substantially different than are generated by integrating equations of motion .",
    "by contrast , the idea behind a dynamic cluster - linking scheme  @xcite is to make a trial move of a single particle and to deal iteratively with the consequences of that move .",
    "this scheme , and certain of its off - lattice generalizations  @xcite , decouple the likelihood of proposing relative moves of particles from their interaction energies in the initial microstate , circumventing the chief deficiency of static cluster - linking schemes . in fig .",

    "@xmath61 is the pairwise energy of the bond @xmath28 in microstate @xmath33 , and @xmath62 is the bond energy following the virtual move of @xmath14 ( @xmath14 is returned to its original position following its virtual move ) .",

    "ensures that neighbors exert mutual forces proportional to the gradient of their pairwise energies , unlike in static linking schemes .",
    "particle motions are correlated at the level of a single move if @xmath63 is large .",
    "we then do as follows .    *",
    "if a pre - link does not form , we label the link @xmath28 as unformed , do not add @xmath15 to the moving cluster , and do not consider the link @xmath28 again .",

    "there is no guarantee that such a procedure will result in motion that is dynamically realistic in all details .",
    "indeed , there are some features of the algorithm that make precise control of cluster motion impossible . for one ,",
    "we do not know in advance the nature of the moving cluster , making it hard to cleanly separate translational from rotational motion ( the same is not true of a static linking procedure ) .",
    "for another , collective motion requires that both forward and reverse virtual moves of one particle ` recruit ' another : if the basic scale of virtual displacements is much smaller than particle interaction ranges then such motion is unlikely .",
    "correspondingly , if the basic scale of virtual displacements is too large , intra - cluster relaxation becomes slow .",
    "some tinkering is needed in order to reach a reasonable compromise between the these two processes .",
    "even given these difficulties , intuition suggests that by moving clusters according to gradients of potential energy , and by choosing cluster diffusion constants @xmath71 in a reasonable way , we should reproduce some key features of overdamped motion .",
    "( it is also worth noting that we have the freedom to scale collective diffusion constants @xmath71 anisotropically , as is physically reasonable , which is not a feature that emerges from simple bd algorithms . )",
    "particles should move in a locally realistic fashion and retain some of the collective degrees of freedom that single - particle moves ignore . a qualitative comparison between a virtual - move algorithm ( the version of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the predecessor of the algorithm described here ) and bd simulations of strongly - attractive discs shows this to be the case , even in circumstances where single - particle moves clearly lack dynamical accuracy  @xcite .",
    "preservation of these important features of real dynamics may be sufficient to determine if the real counterpart of a model system will assemble well or become kinetically trapped .",
    "testing of a virtual - move algorithm against bd simulations of viral capsid self - assembly found that each generates similar values of capsid yields for given model parameters  @xcite .",
    "since yields depend upon both thermodynamics and dynamics , such agreement is encouraging .",
    "other work has used virtual - move algorithms ( the original version  @xcite or the one described here ) to generate dynamical trajectories for self - assembling systems  @xcite or to thermodynamically sample them  @xcite .",
    "the cluster schemes described above treat pairwise - interacting particles .",
