    "the sun s strong magnetic behaviour is clearly revealed through its most prominent visible manifestation , the sunspots .",
    "the newest generation of solar telescopes and the lastest restoration techniques have greatly increased the spatial resolution of the images and therefore the variety of details and tiny structures in and around sunspots that can be resolved .",
    "nevertheless , it is still not well understood how these structures are formed , evolve and affect the photosphere surrounding them .",
    "many approaches have been done in this direction such as the identification of small magnetic elements called `` moving magnetic features '' ( mmf ) travelling radially outwards while immersed in an anullar cell around the sunspot of strong radial outflows known as a `` moat '' @xcite .",
    "for a recent overview of the literature on mmfs see the introduction of @xcite .",
    "the sunspot moat thus defines an organized horizontal flow pattern which ends quite abruptly at a distance that can be comparable to supergranular sizes or even larger . @xcite study the characteristics and temporal evolution of moats at two heights in the atmosphere for a large sample of sunspots with different sizes , shapes and evolutive stage . a similar work studying the properties of moats",
    "was previously performed by @xcite .",
    "the averaged moat flow velocity reported ranges from @xmath00.4 to @xmath01 kms@xmath1 .",
    "new findings @xcite have shown that the penumbral filaments extend beyond the sunspot boundary entering the region dominated by the moat flow where the mmf activity is detected .",
    "thus , the temporal average of magnetograms has unveiled the existence of moat filaments : horizontal , filamentary structures coming from the penumbra and reaching the photosperic network as an extension of penumbral filaments . moreover , some mmfs have been found @xcite starting just inside the sunspot boundary in its way out from the sunspot . @xcite",
    "have established a relationship between the vertical components ( spines ) of the magnetic field in the so - called uncombed structure of the penumbra and mmfs observed in moat regions .    in a recent letter ,",
    "@xcite studied the moat flow in a complex active region .",
    "they found that no outflow was detected in the granulation next to umbral cores that lack penumbrae .",
    "outflows were only found in the granulation regions adjacent to the penumbrae in the direction following the penumbral filaments .",
    "granulation regions located next to penumbral sides parallel to the direction of the filaments show no moat flow .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the study by @xcite to a larger sample of cases , that is to establish whether this moat - penumbra relation is systematically found in other active regions and how the granular convective pattern surrounding sunspots behaves . in doing so",
    ", we have used several high quality time series observed at high spatial resolution .",
    "a total of 7 different sunspot series have been processed and analyzed .",
    "the sample includes sunspots with different penumbral configurations , varying from well - developed penumbrae to rudimentary penumbral morphologies .",
    "the paper describes first in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] how the observations were performed and the restoration technique used to correct for atmospheric aberrations .",
    "once the time series are ready to analyze ,   [ sec : analysis ] presents some calculations and statistics of proper motions of structures surrounding the sample sunspots .",
    "we finally discuss the results and future work in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "the observations were obtained with the ( sst , * ? ? ? * ) on la palma between 2003 and 2006 .",
    "all observations benefited from the use of the sst adaptive optics system @xcite that minimized the degrading effects of seeing .",
    "image post - processing techniques were applied to increase the homogeneity in the quality of the time series and to enhance the image quality over the whole field - of - view ( fov ) . for the 2003 data set we applied multi - frame blind deconvolution ( mfbd ) using the implementation developed by @xcite .",
    "the mfbd code was succeeded by the multi - object multi - frame blind deconvolution code ( momfbd , @xcite ) which employs multiple objects and phase - diversity .",
    "momfbd was applied to the data sets after 2003 .",
    "for all the time series we present in this paper , the seeing conditions were generally very good and sometimes excellent .",
    "a large fraction of the restored images in the different time series approach the diffraction limit of the telescope .    after image restoration , we applied standard techniques to the time series including correction for the diurnal field rotation , rigid alignment and de - stretching to correct for seeing - induced image warping .",
    "a p - modes filter was also applied to the series ( threshold phase velocity 4  kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "table  [ table1 ] presents details for the different active region targets , table  [ table2 ] gives some details on the restored time series .",
    "below we provide more detailed information on the different data sets .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "seven time series of sunspots were restored from instrumental and atmospheric aberrations using mfbd and momfbd techniques . the high quality of the images allowed us to study proper motions of granules outside the sunspots and measure their time - averaged velocities .",
    "we have extended the study by @xcite to a larger sample of active regions and systematically confirmed their findings : a ) moat flows are oriented following the direction of the penumbral filaments ; b ) in granulation regions found adjacent to an irregular penumbral side parallel to the penumbral filaments moats are absent , or in other words , moats do not develop in the direction transverse to the penumbral filaments .",
    "note that if the moat flows were originated by the blockage of the heat flux from below by the penumbra , one would expect moat flows directed along , but also , transverse to the direction of the penumbral filaments ; c ) umbral core sides with no penumbra do not display moat flows .",
    "moreover we include in our sample a case in which a neutral line extends along a penumbral border where we would expect a moat flow continuation .",
    "for this sunspot we do not find any moat flow following the direction of the penumbral filaments after crossing the penumbral border where we see a change in magnetic polarity .",
    "the same result is found by @xcite in a penumbral portion of a complex active region crossed by a strong sheared neutral line .",
    "all these results indicate a likely connection between the moat flows and flows aligned with penumbral filaments . in a recent work , @xcite",
    "suggest that the evershed clouds inside penumbrae propagate to the surrounding moat and then become mmfs after crossing the sunspot border .",
    "the mmfs displacements trace very well - defined paths that can actually be clearly seen when averaging magnetograms in time @xcite .",
    "some of these mmfs are seen to start inside the penumbra .    in this paper",
    "we also complement the study by @xcite with a statistical analysis describing the differences between velocity fields in moat flows and in less - magnetized solar granulation nearby .",
    "in contrast to the granulation , moat flows are well - organized , steady and large - scale motions . for averages made over more than 40 minutes , the mean velocity in moats ( 0.3  kms@xmath1 ) exceed that of quiet granulation ( @xmath0 0.23  kms@xmath1 ) by about 30% ,",
    "although we obtain a considerable dispersion in the results .",
    "also the rms of the velocity magnitude is greater in moats by a similar percentage .",
    "the histograms of velocity magnitudes in the moats are broader than those in granulation .",
    "the histograms of granulation show conspicuous maxima , most of them in a range from 0.2 to 0.3  kms@xmath1 , whereas the histograms of moats present a flatter top .",
    "systematically , the low velocity wing of the granulation histogram lies above that corresponding to the moat . at some point",
    "about 0.3 - 0.4  kms@xmath1 , both histograms cross each other and the right wing of the moat histogram extends beyond that of the granulation to larger velocity values ( @xmath2 0.6  kms@xmath1 )",
    ".    we have studied one case of a sunspot penumbra displaying a neutral line all along a sector of the penumbra ( figure  [ f:9 ] ) .",
    "this neutral line is detected at the penumbral boundary but also emphasized by a large opposite polarity concentration nearby .",
    "interestingly , this penumbral sector shows no moat flow .",
    "we interpret this evidence as an indication of the evershed flow being forced to go into deeper subphotospheric layers at a faster pace than what is normally though to occur in penumbral regions not associated to neutral lines @xcite .",
    "a similar case , but in a sheared neutral line of a @xmath3-spot , was found by @xcite .    though there is increasing evidence linking the moat flows and the evershed flow along the penumbral filaments , the debate regarding the existence of a moat flow around umbral cores and individual pores is still undergoing . in a recent work , @xcite , found that the dividing line between radial inward and outward proper motions in the inner and outer penumbra , respectively , survived the decay phase , suggesting that the moat flow is still detectable after the penumbra disappeared .",
    "previous works @xcite , have measured horizontal proper motions in and around pores and have observed a ringlike structure of positive divergence ( `` rosettas '' ) around the pores , which is related to a continuous activity of exploding granules .",
    "@xcite identified a very clear inflow around pores which corresponds to the penetration of small granules and granular fragments from the photosphere into the pores , pushed by granular motions originated in the divergence centres around them .",
    "they conclude that the motions at the periphery of the pore are substantially and continuously influenced by the external plasma flows deposited by the exploding granules .",
    "we interpret the dividing line between radial inward and outward motions , found by @xcite outside the residual pore , as corresponding to the centres of divergence of the exploding granules around the pore .",
    "the outward motions these authors described , which are not in the immediate surroundings of the pore but separated by the annular inward motion would then correspond to the flows coming out from the regular mesh of divergence centers around the pore .",
    "the important questions related to the flows inside and outside sunspots are yet being studied . in the present work",
    "we contribute with a new sample of sunspots observed between 2003 and 2006 in six different observing campaigns .",
    "the data sets have been selected on basis of the seeing quality ( sharpness , homogeneity , duration ) and on the availability of suitable targets : the presence of spots with some form of irregular penumbra . in all of our samples",
    "we follow the evolution of the sunspots for more than 40 min .",
    "although this only represents a snapshot in the evolution of the sunspots through all their emerging and decaying processes , our sample includes sunspots in different evolutionary stages and penumbral configurations .",
    "new facilities such as the recently launched hinode satellite can provide long time series of active regions with a constant image quality and enough spatial resolution to provide firm confirmation of the evidences found in this paper . the addition of simultaneous doppler and magnetogram data to the continuum intensity ( or g - band ) data sets will enhance our understanding of the link between the evershed and the moat flows . needless to say , the study of those stages were penumbrae are just formed or destroyed becomes of extreme importance to validate our findings .",
    "similarly , the results that can be expected in the coming years from local helioseismology , describing the flow patterns in the deeper layers near sunspots , will prove crucial for the establishment of a clear link between these two well known flow patterns that has so far been not appreciated ."
