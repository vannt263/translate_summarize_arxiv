    "quantum correlations are essential resources that make various quantum informational processes possible , and quantum entanglement has been in the vanguard due to its fundamental roles in non - locality and advantages in many quantum information processing  @xcite . however , entanglement is not the only quantum correlation .",
    "ollivier and zurek proposed another type of quantum correlation , now known as quantum discord , from the perspective of information theory  @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is a measure of nonclassical correlations between two subsystems of a quantum system .",
    "the correlations arise from quantum physical effects",
    ". however , it does not necessarily require quantum entanglement .",
    "hence , there exist separable states with non - zero discord .",
    "there have been significant efforts made to understand the operational meanings of quantum discord  @xcite , and find its applications in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations , both entanglement and quantum discord , can be degraded by decoherence which is often caused by unavoidable coupling with the environment .",
    "there have been many studies that attempt to protect entanglement by tackling decoherence .",
    "for example , one can distill a highly entangled state from multiple copies of partially entangled states  @xcite .",
    "decoherence - free subspace  @xcite and quantum zeno effect  @xcite can be also used to cope with decoherence .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the weak measurement and its reversal measurement can effectively protect entanglement from the amplitude damping decoherence  @xcite .",
    "many of these protocols might be suitable for protecting quantum discord , however , no quantitative research has been done to show the feasibility of the protection of quantum discord . since quantum discord can exist without entanglement and it provides quantum advantages , protecting quantum discord can be useful for some quantum information tasks .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the original protocol that utilizes the weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal in order to supress the effect of decoherence  @xcite and investigate the protocol in terms of quantum discord .",
    "we theoretically and experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of quantum measurement reversal in protecting the amount of quantum discord .",
    "our results ultimately verifies that _ general _ quantum correlations can be protected by the protocol .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : after a brief review of quantum discord in section ii , we provide a numerical method to estimate quantum discord from a given density matrix in detail in section iii .",
    "then , we introduce the weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal protocol as well as the simulation result on quantum discord in section iv .",
    "the experimental setup and discussion is provided in section v , and finally , in section vi , we summarize our research and conclude .",
    "there exist variant versions of quantum discord , which will be introduced and discussed in the following subsections .      for a classical system , information entropy or the shannon entropy measures the ignorance about a discrete random variable @xmath0 with possible values @xmath1 .",
    "if the probability mass function is defined as @xmath2 , then the shannon entropy is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the information content of @xmath0 , and @xmath5 for bit . using the definition of the shannon entropy",
    ", we can find the mutual information of two random variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the joint entropy of two random variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum equivalence of information entropy and mutual information are similar to their classical counterparts . in quantum information theory ,",
    "the entropy of a density matrix @xmath10 is given by the von neumann entropy , @xmath11 note that , for a qubit , @xmath5 since this normalizes the maximum entropic information of a qubit to 1 . for a joint density matrix @xmath12 , the mutual information @xmath13 shared by quantum systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 is given by the following equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15(@xmath16 ) can be deduced by the partial trace @xmath17 . in order to get the amount of quantum discord @xmath18",
    ", one needs to deduct the measure of correlation in the classical limit @xmath19 from the mutual quantum information @xmath13 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a measurement performed locally on the system @xmath7 .",
    "it is noteworthy that quantum discord is not generally symmetric under the exchange of the local system measurements .",
    "for instance , if we can perform a set of measurements @xmath22 , instead of @xmath21 , then we may get a different amount of quantum discord . note that a symmetric discord has been proposed in order to ensure the symmetry  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this paper follows the traditional definition of quantum discord , because the system of interest generally considers the environment that has symmetric effects on the systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 .      because we need to find the supremum of @xmath23 , the quantum discord between systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 is not trivial to calculate . in fact , except for special classes of states such as two - qubit x density matrices , there does not exist a closed form solution for quantum discord @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", one needs to implement complex numerical methods in order to calculate the amount of quantum discord which is presented in sec .",
    "iii .    in order to overcome this problem , dakic _ et al .",
    "_ introduced geometric quantum discord that is based on the hilbert - schmidt distance between the density matrix @xmath12 and its closest classical state @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "its definition is as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hilbert - schmidt 1-norm , defined as @xmath28 .",
    "this definition of quantum discord also requires numerical methods .",
    "however , the calculation process is much simpler and faster compared to the entropic definition of quantum discord since there is no need to perform logarithms of matrices .",
    "there is another definition of geometric discord , based on the hilbert - schmidt 2-norm , @xmath29 where @xmath30 . however ,",
    "recently it has been pointed out that this definition is not a good measure of quantum correlation , because it may increase under local reversible operations on the unmeasured subsystem @xcite .",
    "hence , the discussion about the 2-norm definition will be omitted in this paper .",
    "in this section , we provide numerical methods to calculate two different definitions of quantum discord , entropic discord and geometric discord . for simplicity , the discussion starts with two - qubit density matrix ( @xmath31 systems ) , and we extend the discussion further for any multi - qudit systems ( @xmath32 systems ) . note that the computational complexity of quantum discord is classified as np - complete @xcite .",
    "hence , resources required for computing quantum discord grow exponentially with the dimension of the hilbert space . for any @xmath32 systems",
    ", we layout a numerical recipe for computing quantum discord based on the monte carlo sampling of the @xmath33- and @xmath34-dimensional spaces .",
    "our method does not search over the entire hilber space , but it does give us reasonably close results , as we tested the integrity of the algorithms with repetitive trials of randomly generated density matrices with known analytical solutions .",
    "the estimation of entropic discord consists of two parts .",
    "one part is to calculate @xmath13 ( eq .",
    "( @xmath35 ) ) , and it is fairly trivial . note that @xmath12 is in the basis of @xmath36 or @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "the other part is to find the supremum of the functional @xmath39 ( eq .",
    "( @xmath40 ) ) . equation ( @xmath40 )",
    "can be expanded to a more explicit form @xcite , @xmath41 the second term in the equation is what requires a numerical approach .",
    "let us define the second term of eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) as a function , @xmath42 we are looking for the infimum of the functional because eq .  (",
    "[ j ] ) has to be maximized .",
    "a qubit can have outcomes of either @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "however , any rotational transformation of @xmath43 or @xmath44 is a valid outcome of the measurement as well .",
    "hence , for this calculation , we need to consider all the possible measurement basis .",
    "we start with two orthogonal measurement bases @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 by a simple rotational transformation @xmath48 , we can generalize the measurement outcome @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 note that @xmath51 is a unit vector in the bloch sphere representation , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is a tensor of the pauli matrices @xmath56 where @xmath57    using the above relations , we can deduce @xmath12 for a given set of measurement @xmath21 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 .",
    "it is now obvious that the functional @xmath61 of eq .",
    "( @xmath62 ) is a function of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and we can numerically estimate the extremum by simply searching over the spherical space , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "geometric quantum discord can be calculated in a similar manner .",
    "first , one needs to define an abtitrary zero quantum discord state for a given joint density matrix @xmath12 . for this , let us define the reduced density matrix @xmath16 given the measurement @xmath65 of @xmath6 , @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 \\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{ab } \\ } \\text { , } \\\\",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{b||1\\rangle_a } =   { \\rm tr}_a \\ { \\left [ \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ) \\otimes \\boldsymbol{i } \\right ] \\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{ab } \\ } \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the zero quantum discord state @xmath24 can be found by using the following equation : @xmath70 using the relations described above , eq .",
    "( @xmath71 ) can also be calculated by searching over the same spherical space , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "although this approach works fine , the optimization may be necessary for special cases .",
    "it is relatively easy to calculate the quantum discord of a two - qubit state , but for high dimensional qudits of @xmath72 where @xmath33 stands for a dimension of the quantum state , the searching process might take a very long time .",
    "one might encounter multiple local minima for a given arbitrary density matrix .",
    "though we can not yet rigorously prove which method of numerical estimation is the best way to deduce the quantum discord of an arbitrary quantum system , a number of numerical evaluations led us to the conclusion that the monte carlo sampling is sufficient for estimating the measure .",
    "because it may be useful for calculating the quantum discord for a multi - qudit system , the general method is briefly discussed in the following .    for a qudit system , one can define the generalized bloch sphere using the generalized gell - mann matrices , which are essentially the pauli matrices equivalence of higher - dimensional extensions @xcite . for a qudit system of @xmath73 ,",
    "i.e. , su(@xmath74 ) , there are a total of @xmath75 gell - mann matrices .",
    "they can be classified into three groups : @xmath76    \\i ) @xmath77 symmetric gell - mann matrices @xmath78    \\ii ) @xmath77 antisymmetric gell - mann matrices @xmath79    \\iii ) @xmath80 diagonal gell - mann matrices @xmath81    using the gell - mann matrices , we can define the generalized bloch vector expansion of a density matrix @xmath82 where the bloch vector @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the tensor of the generalized gell - mann matrices @xcite .",
    "let @xmath85 be the set of all points @xmath86 such that @xmath87 is positive semidefinite . by definition",
    ", @xmath88 is the state space or the generalized bloch sphere .",
    "if one uses a systemmatic approach to calculate quantum discord as it is described for entropic and geometric discord for two - qubit states , we can search over all the generalized bloch sphere , of which method consumes extensive computational resources .",
    "however , for the monte carlo sampling , each component in @xmath89 is just a random variable .",
    "programmatically speaking , we select @xmath75 random variables @xmath90 and one additional random variable @xmath91 , whose absolute values are all uniformly distributed in the range from 0 to 1 . with these random variables , we can construct @xmath89 by the following way : @xmath92 by having @xmath91 , we can cover all the possible bloch vector , @xmath93 . note that these randomly chosen density matrices must have physical values , i.e. , they must be hermitian and positive semidefinite .",
    "for instance , there is a possibility that diagonal terms of @xmath48 can be negative , if we carelessly applied the construction described above .",
    "one must be careful and eliminate such cases for calculation .",
    "the estimation method of the monte carlo sampling is tested under various cases , including two - qubit , two - qutrit cases , and any combinations of arbitrary _",
    "d_-dimensional quantum systems . using this method with a sufficiently large number of sampling",
    "can provide you a good estimation of quantum discord quickly .",
    "the plots and figures of the papers are generated with the methods described in this section , including the monte carlo sampling .",
    "let us introduce the amplitude damping decoherence suppression protocol using the weak measurement and the quantum measurement reversal  @xcite .",
    "our systems of interest are two - level quantum systems ( s ) whose bases are @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "alice prepares a two - qubit correlated state @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "this state is then delivered to bob and charlie through the quantum channels of which amplitude - damping decoherences are characterized as @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "we can make it turn around by sequential operations of weak measurement ( @xmath108 ) and reversing measurement ( @xmath109 ) , performed beforehand and afterward of decoherence , respectively .",
    "these operations are non - unitary and defined as follows : @xmath110 where @xmath59 and @xmath111 are the strengths of the weak measurement and the reversing measurement for bob ( @xmath112 ) and charlie ( @xmath113 ) , respectively .",
