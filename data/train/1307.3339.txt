    "density - functional theory ( dft ) is now widely used to study water and ice in a range of different environments , including for example bulk water , water at interfaces , and water under confinement .",
    "most dft studies of water have involved the application of semi - local generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) for the exchange and correlation ( _ xc _ ) energy . whilst these studies have proved to be very useful in providing insights into the structure and properties of water",
    ", there are persistent question marks over the quantitative accuracy of such  _ xc _ functionals , in particular for the treatment of condensed phase water which is held together by hydrogen ( h ) bonding and van der waals ( vdw ) interactions . over the years",
    "this has prompted a number of benchmark studies focused on gas phase water clusters @xcite , liquid water , @xcite and crystalline phases of ice .",
    "@xcite ) while we currently have a relatively clear understanding about the performance of various  _ xc _ functionals for gas phase clusters , this is far from being established for ice and liquid water .",
    "this is particularly true in light of recent work which has shown that vdw dispersion forces are important for the accurate description of different properties of water .",
    "@xcite    understanding the role of vdw forces in water has been greatly helped by the emergence of various approaches for accounting for vdw forces within the framework of dft .",
    "@xcite in the last few years many of the vdw inclusive dft  _ xc _ functionals have been used to investigate the effects of vdw on the structural , energetic , and vibrational properties of liquid water . @xcite overall , with vdw inclusive  _ xc _ functionals there are indeed improvements in certain calculated properties of liquid water . for example , the first peak in the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function is generally reduced and brought into closer agreement with experiment . however , the accuracy of the computed properties strongly depends on the methods chosen to incorporate vdw as well as the technical details of the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "there is , of course , also the challenge of accounting for quantum nuclear effects , which is rarely done in  _ ab initio _ studies of liquid water .",
    "@xcite however , in contrast to liquid water , the various crystalline phases of ice represent a relatively straightforward set of structures against which dft methods can be tested .",
    "indeed there are at present 15 experimentally characterized ice phases with water molecules in a number of distinct arrangements , h bond networks , and densities .",
    "@xcite many of the ice phases are complicated with disordered water arrangements ( so called `` proton disordered '' ) . however , some phases have relatively simple proton ordered arrangements of water molecules , and it is these phases that are particularly suitable as benchmarks .",
    "furthermore , thanks to whalley s extrapolations of the experimental finite temperature and pressure phase coexistence lines to zero temperature , for some of these phases there are even estimates of the internal energy differences ,  @xcite which makes theoretical benchmarks particularly straightforward and mitigates the need for expensive free energy calculations .        in an earlier study on ice we found that the effects of vdw become increasingly important upon going from the low- to the high - density phases and capturing this variation in the vdw energy is essential to get the transition pressures between the ice phases within an order of magnitude of experiment .",
    "@xcite here , we extend on the previous study significantly by reporting results on the accuracy of the cohesive properties of individual phases of ice obtained from a wide range of vdw inclusive functionals . also by looking at the enthalpies of ice as a function of pressure we have obtained a more detailed picture of the stability range of each ice phase predicted from the different functionals .",
    "the approaches used here include : i ) vdw@xmath1 , which involves an explicit summation of pair - wise ( two - body ) vdw dispersion interactions among all atom pairs using their respective vdw @xmath2 coefficients which are functionals of the electron density ;  @xcite ( ii ) vdw@xmath3 , an extension of vdw@xmath1 that accounts for electrodynamic screening and many - body vdw interactions within the dipole approximation ;  @xcite and ( iii ) various functionals from the `` vdw - df '' family .",
    "@xcite all vdw - dfs are calculated via a model dynamic response function and long range pairwise approximations .",
    "@xcite these various vdw inclusive approaches have been reasonably successful in modeling a wide variety of materials  @xcite including different phases of water starting from clusters  @xcite to condensed phases .",
    "@xcite in this study we find that all vdw inclusive functionals considered predict phase transition pressures in much better agreement with experiment than the functionals which do not include vdw .",
    "however , the precise values of the lattice constants and lattice energies are highly sensitive to the choice of vdw inclusive method . moreover , none of the functionals can simultaneously produce energetics and volumes of the ice phases with high enough precision to yield a phase diagram that correctly captures all the phases found in experiments .    in the next section details of the simulation methods",
    "are provided .",
    "this is followed by discussions of our results for the equilibrium lattice energies ( [ sec3a ] ) , the equilibrium volumes ( [ sec3b ] ) , enthalpies ( [ sec3c ] ) , and a decomposition of total energies focusing on exchange and correlation energies ( [ sec3d ] ) . conclusions and a short perspective on future work are given in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we have computed and analyzed the equilibrium lattice energies , volumes , and enthalpies of several ice phases .",
    "this includes the ambient pressure phase of ice , ice i@xmath0 , and all the proton ordered high - pressure phases , namely , in order of increasing pressure , ice ix , ii , xiii , xiv , xv , viii .",
    "we have focused on proton ordered phases because they are more straightforward to model than the proton disordered phases .",
    "the initial structures used for the proton ordered phases have been obtained from experiment  @xcite and the unit cells used are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "proton disordered ice i@xmath0 is modeled with the 12 water unit cell proposed by hamann .",
    "@xcite the results obtained from the 12 molecule cell have also been compared to results from a unit cell of 96 water molecules ( ref .",
    "these results reveal that the lattice energies obtained from the 12 and 96 water molecule unit cells are within 1 mev / h@xmath4o and the equilibrium volumes differ only by @xmath50.01 @xmath6/h@xmath4o with pbe .  @xcite    the lattice energy per h@xmath4o ( @xmath7 ) of ice is obtained by subtracting the total energy of @xmath8 isolated h@xmath4o molecules ( @xmath9 ) from the total energy of the ice unit cell ( @xmath10 ) containing @xmath8 molecules of h@xmath4o , i.e. , @xmath11 at zero pressure the theoretical equilibrium lattice energies and volumes are obtained by varying the lattice parameters isotropically within @xmath1220% of the experimental values and fitting the resultant energy - volume curves to the murnaghan equation of state .",
    "@xcite by isotropic variation we mean that the ratios of the lattice parameters are kept fixed at the experimental value , which is a reasonable approximation that has an insignificant influence on the computed properties .",
    "for example , performing a rigorous test on ice viii by varying the @xmath13 ratio of the lattice parameters provides changes of @xmath50.5 mev / h@xmath4o and @xmath50.02 @xmath6/h@xmath4o , respectively in the equilibrium lattice energy and volume when compared to the results obtained by fixing the @xmath13 ratio at the experimental value .",
    "@xcite also previously it was shown that for ice i@xmath0 the equilibrium @xmath13 ratio is very similar ( within @xmath140.4% ) to the experimental value when calculated with various _",
    "xc _ functionals .",
    "@xcite    the properties of the various ice phases have been investigated with seven functionals , representing a number of different classes of functional .",
    "these include , pbe , a widely used gga functional , and pbe0 ,  @xcite a hybrid exchange variant of pbe . neither of these functionals account for vdw forces .",
    "we have also considered pbe+vdw@xmath1 and pbe0+vdw@xmath1 , vdw inclusive versions of pbe and pbe0 , where the vdw interaction is calculated with the tkatchenko and scheffler ( ts ) scheme .",
    "@xcite the xc energy ( @xmath15 ) in this scheme takes the form @xmath16 where , @xmath17 is the pbe or pbe0 exchange , @xmath18 is the lda correlation , @xmath19 is the pbe semi - local correlation correction , and @xmath20 is the vdw energy in the ts scheme .",
    "in addition , we have employed an extension of the @xmath21 approach which takes into account many - body ( mb ) dispersion and long - range electrostatic screening .",
    "@xcite in this case @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is replaced with mb dispersion energy terms and the  _ xc _ functional is referred to as pbe0+vdw@xmath3 . another approach to incorporate vdw within dft",
    "is employed here , specifically the approach generally referred to as `` vdw - df '' .",
    "@xcite in this case the total  _ xc _ energy takes the form @xmath22 where , @xmath23 is gga exchange , and @xmath24 is the nonlocal correlation energy through which the vdw interactions are captured . we have used three functionals from this category which we refer to as revpbe - vdw ,  @xcite optpbe - vdw ,  @xcite and rpw86-vdw2 .  @xcite the difference between revpbe - vdw ( originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and optpbe - vdw is in the exchange functional only .",
    "the former employs revpbe  @xcite exchange , whereas the latter uses optpbe exchange  @xcite which was developed by fitting interaction energies obtained for the s22 data set .",
    "@xcite typically optpbe exchange is less repulsive than revpbe at intermediate and short inter - atomic distances .",
    "compared to the above two functionals rpw86-vdw2 has a different exchange rpw86",
    "@xcite and a modified nonlocal correlation functional .",
    "@xcite we should note that all three vdw - df functionals utilize gga exchange .",
    "the calculations with pbe and pbe+vdw@xmath1 were performed with the all electron numeric atom - centered orbital ( nao ) basis set code fhi - aims .",
    "@xcite sufficiently large basis sets ( `` _ _ tier__2 '' for h and `` _ _ tier__3 '' for o ) were employed to calculate total energies and to optimize structures .",
    "pbe0 , revpbe - vdw , optpbe - vdw , and rpw86-vdw2 calculations were done with the vasp code  @xcite with the hardest projector - augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials and a 1000 ev plane - wave basis set cut off .",

    "@xcite these settings are found to be very accurate and details of the implementation and tests performed for a variety of solids can be found in ref .  .",
    "for all the ice structures the atoms are fully relaxed with all of the  _ xc _ functionals ( except with pbe0+vdw@xmath1 and pbe0+vdw@xmath3 ) without any symmetry constraints until all forces are less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the energy - volume curves of each ice phase with pbe0+vdw@xmath1 and pbe0+vdw@xmath3 were produced by performing single point energy calculations on the pbe0 optimized geometries at different volumes . for the calculations of any gga exchange based functional the number of  k points are chosen so that the spacing in the  k point grid in each direction of reciprocal space is within 0.02  @xmath28 to 0.04  @xmath28 for all of the ice phases .",

    "subsequently we report an analysis of the individual contributions from exchange and correlation to the lattice energies .",
    "the lattice energy is one of the key characteristic quantities of a solid and we use it here to evaluate the performance and deficiencies of different  _ xc _ functionals in describing ice .",
    "previously most analysis of lattice energies concentrated on ice i@xmath0 ,  @xcite however , recently we showed that studying ice i@xmath0 alone is not enough to establish the general behavior of an  _ xc _ functional over the entire phase diagram of water .",
    "@xcite here we have calculated the lattice energies of different ice phases using a wide variety of  _ xc _ functionals and made comparisons with experiments  @xcite and diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc )  @xcite whenever possible ( table  [ tb1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the dft and dmc lattice energies reported in table  [ tb1 ] do not include nuclear zero - point energies ( zpes ) and are directly comparable with the experimental lattice energies provided by whalley ,  @xcite in which zpe contributions were removed and the energies were extrapolated to 0 k. in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the differences in the calculated and experimental lattice energies are shown for ice i@xmath0 , ix , ii , and viii for all the functionals considered .",
    "it can be seen that for the phases for which dmc data is available the agreement between dmc and experiment is excellent , differing only by 5 mev / h@xmath4o at most , which is also the size of the dmc statistical errors .",
    "we begin with the performance of functionals which do not account for vdw ( pbe and pbe0 ) on the absolute values of the lattice energies .",
    "the behavior of pbe for ice i@xmath0 is well known , it over - estimates the lattice energy : overestimations of between 30 to 100 mev / h@xmath4o have been reported depending on the computational set - up used ( mainly the quality of the basis sets and pseudopotentials ) .",
    "@xcite here , using a full potential all - electron approach and very tightly converged nao basis sets , we find that pbe over - estimates the lattice energy of ice i@xmath0 by @xmath1426 mev / h@xmath4o ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is in close agreement with the results from highly converged paw calculations reported in ref .  .",
    "interestingly the established notion that pbe overestimates the lattice energies of ice does not hold for the high - density phases .",
    "for example , pbe exhibits a @xmath14125 mev / h@xmath4o underestimation for the lattice energy of ice viii .",
    "the story is somewhat similar for pbe0 , the hybrid variant of pbe .",
    "pbe0 predicts a very good lattice energy for ice i@xmath0 ( only 15 mev / h@xmath4o less than experiment ) but simultaneously underestimates the lattice energy of the high - density ice phases .",
    "we believe that the behavior seen here for pbe and pbe0 is likely to apply to many other gga and hybrid  _ xc _ functionals . for example , our calculations show that blyp and revpbe gga functionals under - estimate the lattice energy of ice viii by 246 mev / h@xmath4o and 316 mev / h@xmath4o , respectively .",
    "similar findings have also been reported for b3lyp .",
    "@xcite    in general we find that when vdw is accounted for the differences between the calculated and experimental lattice energies are much less sensitive to the particular phases being examined ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "considering first the vdw@xmath1 scheme , with the pbe+vdw@xmath1 and pbe0+vdw@xmath1 functionals the lattice energies are on average @xmath14100 mev / h@xmath4o and @xmath1460 mev / h@xmath4o , respectively too large compared to experiment .",
    "the smaller errors obtained from pbe0+vdw@xmath1 largely arise from the difference between pbe and pbe0 since the vdw contributions from these functionals obtained with the ts scheme are similar ( to within 15 mev / h@xmath4o ) .",
    "the contributions from vdw interactions beyond two - body vdw@xmath1 to lattice energies are found to be small for the phases considered .",
    "specifically , the pbe0+vdw@xmath3 approach reduces the error by 7 - 17 mev / h@xmath4o for the high - density phases compared to the standard pbe0+vdw@xmath1 . a noticeable exception to the consistent performance of vdw@xmath1 found for ice i@xmath0 , ix , and ii is the highest density ice viii phase ( by 40 - 50 mev / h@xmath4o [ fig .  [ fig2 ] ] ) .",
    "this inconsistency is largely due to the shortcomings of the damping function used in the vdw@xmath1 approach in describing the interpenetrating h bond network in ice viii which has water molecules that do not form h bonds with each other as close as 2.9    apart .",
    "when the vdw - df functionals are utilized the errors are more consistent for the phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , the magnitude and sign of the error varies considerably from one functional to another , e.g. , on average optpbe - vdw produces too large ( @xmath1460 mev / h@xmath4o ) and revpbe - vdw produces too small ( @xmath1450 mev / h@xmath4o ) lattice energies compared to experiment .",
    "the fact that revpbe - vdw underestimates the lattice energy is not a surprise and consistent with results obtained with this functional for small molecules and water clusters .",
    "@xcite previously reported lattice energies of ice i@xmath0 with revpbe - vdw are 30 - 35 mev / h@xmath4o larger than what we obtain here .",
    "this is not a very substantial difference and we suspect it is mostly down to differences in pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite here , rpw86-vdw2 provides the best agreement with experimental lattice energies being consistently within @xmath1415 mev / h@xmath4o of experiment for all ice phases .",

    "although the relative stabilities of ice xiii , xiv , and xv are not known ( either from experiment or dmc ) they should also fall within the 33 mev / h@xmath4o window since ice viii is the least stable phase at zero pressure and 0 k ( of all the phases studied here )",

    ", when comparison with experiment is possible the phases between ice i@xmath0 and ice viii are also destabilized too much .",
    "all vdw inclusive functionals reduce the energy differences between the phases , bringing them into much closer agreement with experiment .",

    "as noted earlier , zpe contributions were not considered in the above discussions as zpe effects do not play a significant role in determining the relative energies of the various ice phases .",
    "the main effect from zpe contributions is to reduce the lattice energies by about 120 - 110 mev / h@xmath4o .",
    "this applies across the board for all phases and functionals considered , although a small monotonic decrease on the level of 6 - 10 mev / h@xmath4o is seen upon going from the low- to the high - density phases .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section zpe effects do influence the equilibrium volumes significantly .",
    "the equilibrium volume , which is a measure of the density of the phases , is another important quantity used to assess the performance of different theoretical methods .",
    "previous efforts focused mostly on calculating the density of ice i@xmath0 , whereas here we seek to understand how functionals perform for a range of phases .",
    "table ii and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show comparisons of the calculated and experimental volumes .",
    "the equilibrium volumes of ice i@xmath0 obtained using both pbe and pbe0 are @xmath144% smaller than experiment , which is consistent with previous calculations .",
    "@xcite upon going to higher densities , however , contrasting behavior is observed and as one moves to higher densities there is an increasing tendency to overestimate the volume . indeed for ice viii the volume is overestimated by 4% with both pbe and pbe0 .",
    "clearly , the greater underestimation of vdw interactions at higher densities leads to a progressive overestimation of the equilibrium volumes .",
    "overall though , and in contrast to the lattice energies , the performance of pbe and pbe0 for the equilibrium volumes are reasonable , differing by @xmath52% from experiment when averaged over all ice phases .",
    "with vdw@xmath1 the volumes are decreased by 3 - 9% from their parent functionals ( pbe and pbe0 ) and in comparison to experiment the volumes actually become worse .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) . going beyond two - body vdw@xmath1",
    "the equilibrium volumes are reduced further and compared to experiment the average difference becomes @xmath147% .",
    "it is noteworthy that vdw@xmath3 reduces the volume of ice viii more than vdw@xmath1 , and as a result it improves the relative change in the volume with respect to ice xv , which in turn substantially affects the phase transition pressures ( section  [ sec3c ] ) .",
    "contrary to the performance of the vdw@xmath1 approaches , the equilibrium volumes obtained from revpbe - vdw are on average @xmath1410% too large ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . such behavior of revpbe - vdw has been attributed to the overly repulsive revpbe exchange functional and is analogous to what has been found earlier with this functional for many other solids .",
    "@xcite the rpw86-vdw2 functional incorporates improvements in both the exchange and correlation components of the functional compared to revpbe - vdw and we find that this is reflected in improved volumes , being on average @xmath145% larger than experiment .",
    "however , this performance is still inferior to pbe and pbe0 . of the vdw inclusive functionals",
    "optpbe - vdw provides the smallest average error being within 2% of experiment for all the ice phases .    unlike the lattice energies",
    ", the effects of zpe on the equilibrium volumes can not be ignored , especially in the higher density phases .",
    "the effect of zpe on the equilibrium volumes is estimated by computing free energy as a function of volume as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 being the frequency of phonon mode @xmath41 at a given volume . in line with the recent study of murray and galli ,  @xcite",
    "we find that with pbe the volumes of ice i@xmath0 and viii increase by @xmath140.5% and @xmath145.5% , respectively when zpe effects are accounted for ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and table  [ tb2 ] ) .",
    "indeed overall we find that the zpe effects gradually increase from the low- to high - density phases and depending on the functional the increase in the equilibrium volume for the highest density ice viii phase is somewhere between 3 - 6% .",
    "@xcite thus , compared to experiments the mean absolute error in predicting volumes of phases increases by @xmath142% for vdw - df and decreases by @xmath141.5% for vdw@xmath1 when zpe effects are accounted for .",
    "overall for all the vdw inclusive functionals , when zpe effects are taken into account optpbe - vdw and pbe0+vdw@xmath1 are the two best functionals in terms of predicting volumes ( table  [ tb2 ] ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows the enthalpies of the various phases as a function of pressure relative to the enthalpy of ice i@xmath0 ( at 0 k and zero pressure ) .",
    "the most stable phase at each pressure is the one with the lowest enthalpy and the crossovers between different phases indicate the pressures at which the phase transitions are predicted to occur .",

    "inclusion of many - body vdw decreases the energy difference between ice viii and ice xv by 10 mev / h@xmath4o and brings the relative change in the equilibrium volume ( 2.2 @xmath6/h@xmath4o ) into better agreement with experiment ( 2.4 @xmath6/h@xmath4o ) .",

    "the contribution from the exchange energy ( @xmath46 ) to the lattice energy is obtained by subtracting the exchange energy of @xmath8 isolated h@xmath4o molecules ( @xmath47 ) from the exchange energy of the ice unit cells ( @xmath48 ) containing @xmath8 h@xmath4o molecules and can be defined as : @xmath49 an equivalent definition is used to extract the contribution form the correlation energy ( @xmath50 ) to the lattice energy .    figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and  [ fig5](b ) show the variations in @xmath46 and @xmath50 for all ice phases at the equilibrium densities obtained from each  _ xc _ functional .",
    "in general we find that upon going from the low to the high density phases the energetically favorable exchange contribution to the lattice energy decreases , just as the lattice energies do .",
    "we also find that the exchange contribution to the lattice energy strongly depends on the equilibrium volumes obtained with the various functionals .",
    "consequently revpbe - vdw predicts the largest volumes and smallest @xmath46 and pbe+vdw@xmath1 the smallest volumes and largest @xmath46 for all phases . since the hybrid pbe0 exchange yields accurate electrostatic properties ( e.g. , polarizability , dipole moment , electronic band gap ) for the gas and condensed phases of water  @xcite it s somewhat useful to consider pbe0 @xmath46 as a reference against which we compare other exchange functionals . in this regard pbe and optpbe",
    "follow pbe0 fairly closely over the entire pressure range . on the other hand , while rpw86-vdw2 @xmath46 is within 10 mev / h@xmath4o of the pbe0 value for ice i@xmath0 and ix , it deviates substantially ( @xmath3870 mev / h@xmath4o more negative ) for the higher density ice phases , implying that rpw86 exchange is over stabilized compared to pbe0 exchange for the highest pressure phase .",
    "similarly pbe+vdw@xmath1 and pbe0+vdw@xmath1 @xmath46 are substantially more negative than pbe0 exchange for all phases except ice viii",
    ". however , this is mainly due to the smaller volumes predicted by these approaches compared to pbe0 .",
    "the contributions from correlations to the lattice energies , @xmath50 , show why pbe and pbe0 perform so poorly for the high - density phases .",
    "specifically we find that the pbe @xmath50 is nearly constant for all the ice phases , which is in stark contrast to the predictions from the vdw inclusive  _ xc _ functionals that @xmath50 increases from the low to high density phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the relative contributions of vdw forces coming from the various vdw inclusive functionals .",
    "however , this not straightforward because the correlation energies in vdw@xmath1 and the vdw - dfs contain different terms ( _ c.f .",
    "[ eqn_ts ] and  [ eqn_vdw - df ] ) . nonetheless , since in the vdw@xmath1 scheme used here vdw is the correlation energy coming beyond gga pbe ( @xmath51 ) we have computed a similar quantity from the vdw - dfs by subtracting @xmath19 ( with gga pbe ) from @xmath24 . the contribution of this modified non - local correlation energy to the lattice energy of ice",
    "is denoted as @xmath52 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) .",
    "when we examine this term we find that it increases from the low to the high - density ice phases with all vdw inclusive functionals .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath52 predicted by the different approaches differs significantly .",
    "rpw86-vdw2 predicts the smallest @xmath52 , revpbe - vdw and optpbe - vdw the largest , and pbe / pbe0+vdw@xmath1 falls in the middle . since a major component of @xmath52 is non - local vdw interactions the magnitude of @xmath52 should depend strongly on the vdw @xmath2 coefficients .",
    "indeed , we find that the molecular @xmath2 coefficients calculated on ice ( table  [ tb4 ] ) with the different functionals correlate well with the relative magnitude of @xmath52 .  @xcite previous work showed that the @xmath2 coefficient of an isolated water molecule is @xmath550% too small with rpw86-vdw2 compared to experiment .",
    "@xcite here we find the same behavior for the @xmath2 coefficients of water molecules within all ice phases .",
    "compared to all other vdw functionals the molecular @xmath2 coefficients obtained from rpw86-vdw2 are strikingly smaller , 40 - 50% for ice i@xmath0 and 35 - 45% for ice viii . to sum up , this brief analysis of the exchange and correlation contributions to the lattice energies has revealed that the large reduction in the exchange contribution to the lattice energy upon going from the low- to the high - density phases is compensated for by a growing correlation contribution to the lattice energy from the beyond gga correlation ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this compensation is obviously found for the vdw inclusive methods but not found for pbe and pbe0 and as a result the lattice energies are underestimated with pbe and pbe0 for the high pressure phases .",
    "we have performed a detailed study on a selection of different ice phases with a range of  _ xc _ functionals , including some of the recently developed functionals which account for vdw dispersion forces . whilst we know a lot about the performance of these functionals in the gas phase ( in particular on gas phase data sets such as the s22  @xcite ) much less is known about how these functionals perform in the condensed phases , which was one of the key motivations for this study . as seen before in the gas phase",
    "the vdw inclusive functionals do offer some improvement in performance .",
    "this is particularly true for the relative energies of the different phases and as a result the phase transition pressures .",
    "however , the functionals tested are far from perfect and none simultaneously yields excellent lattice energies and lattice constants for all phases . of the schemes considered",
    "pbe0+vdw@xmath1 consistently overestimates lattice energies by @xmath1450 mev / h@xmath4o and equilibrium densities by @xmath145% .",
    "optpbe - vdw produces densities of ice that are in best agreement ( @xmath143% ) with experiment but the lattice energies are @xmath1450 mev / h@xmath4o too large .",
    "revpbe - vdw underestimates densities by @xmath3810% and lattice energies by @xmath1450 mev / h@xmath4o .",
    "rpw86-vdw2 gives very accurate lattice energies but the densities are underestimated by @xmath388% .",
    "the improved agreement between the experimental and calculated phase transition pressures when using the vdw functionals clearly highlights the importance of accounting for vdw in ice .",
    "however , even with vdw inclusive functionals , capturing all of the experimentally characterized ice phases on the water phase diagram is clearly still a major challenge and beyond the capabilities of the methods considered here .",
    "water is well known to provide a stern challenge for dft , be it water clusters , liquid water and now ice .",
    "the fact that several phases of ice are missing from the phase diagram of water is somewhat of a blow to the true predictive ability of the methods considered here , but also a challenge and opportunity for developing and testing new methods .    from this study",
    "it is evident that the ice phases considered here are extremely useful in providing a challenging `` data set '' against which new methods can be tested and proved .",
    "it would of course be interesting to see how some of the other vdw inclusive dft methods developed recently perform on the ice phases . in this respect",
    "the already available experimental lattice energies and the matching dmc numbers are valuable references . however , additional dmc data on other phases of ice would certainly be of value as would other vdw inclusive methods e.g. , random - phase approximation  @xcite and second order mller - plesset perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite finally , we note that the difficulty in predicting ice phases up to only the pressure range 1 - 2 gpa using gga , hybrid , and vdw inclusive dft approaches suggests that caution must be exercised when searching for and predicting new phases of water at yet higher pressures using such functionals .",
