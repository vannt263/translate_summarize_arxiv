    "we consider the second order difference equation defined by @xmath3 for all integers @xmath4 , with initial condition @xmath2 , where @xmath1 are real parameters .",

    "the case when @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the initial conditions are nonnegative was also considered by inar @xcite , who stated a similar formula for the subsequences of even and odd terms of the solutions .",

    "the author finds the representation formula as in the previous cases and proves that for @xmath18 , one of the subsequences converges to zero and the other one diverges .",

    "an advantage of our approach is that it allows us to consider arbitrary initial conditions , and to split our study in three cases , depending only on the values of the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "we get as particular cases all the mentioned known results in the literature about equation ( [ 1 ] ) , but also other cases are solved here for the first time .",
    "our results on bifurcation and stability of the solutions in sections 4 and 5 are also new .    the key feature of the solutions to ( [ 1 ] )",
