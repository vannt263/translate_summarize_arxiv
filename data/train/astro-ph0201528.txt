    "as a rule , accelerator experiments provide data of very high quality . but such measurements seem to be hardly possible at energies , @xmath7  ev , even in the very distant future .    on the other hand , _ non - accelerator _ , observational physics gives a good chance to get data at ultrahigh energies @xcite .",
    "but the accuracy of data in this case is worse due to scarcer statistics and lower resolution of detectors .",
    "it is remarkable , that non - accelerator _ high - energy ( he ) _ physics combines into one the telescope and microscope physics .",
    "really , the detected _ ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) _ particles are produced in perhaps most distant , extragalactic cosmic sources .",
    "hence , it deals with extremely large , cosmological , distances . on the other hand ,",
    "interactions of such particles with matter occur at least distances .",
    "realization of _ uhe _  astrophysics is a complex problem .",
    "it poses many hard questions , such as :    \\1 .",
    "what types of ultrahigh - energy particles may be observed ?",
    "\\2 . where and how ultrahigh - energy particles are produced ?",
    "what detectors are to be used ?",
    "\\4 . what is the expected rate of events in a detector ?",
    "does this rate exceed the background ?",
    "let us try to answer these questions in brief .      through the centuries people used only star light , viz .",
    "optic photons , for the sky observation .",
    "today actually the whole range of e.m .",
    "radiation , up to tev photons @xcite , is involved in measurements .",
    "another well - known example of high - energy cosmic radiation is provided by cosmic rays _ ( crs)_. these are mostly protons ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and up to @xmath12 ions , which continuously bombard the atmosphere .",
    "energy spectrum of _ crs _  extends from @xmath13  gev up to perhaps @xmath14  ev ; the highest energy event with @xmath15  ev has been detected by the _ agasa _",
    "array @xcite .",
    "the nature of incident particles in such events as well as where and how they are produced is unknown .",
    "moreover , the average path length of @xmath16  ev protons in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( with temperature @xmath17 ) is essentially limited by @xmath18 interactions @xcite ( _ gzk _ cut - off ) , so that their presence in _ crs _  is a problem .    besides traditional photons and _ crs _ , gravitation waves and neutrinosare also regarded as possible instruments for _ he _  astrophysics . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on neutrinos , in particular , on _",
    "_  neutrinoswith @xmath19  ev .",
    "being neutral , they do not deflect in magnetic fields , hence their arrival directions shoot back to the production site .",
    "small cross - sections  allow these neutrinos  to travel extremely large distances without absorption .",
    "but their production in cosmic sources is difficult ( i.e.  sources are rare ) and these sources are distant .",
    "it makes the expected flux to be small .",
    "moreover , detection of such neutrinos  is complicated by the same small cross - sections . to compensate for these negative factors",
    ", one should construct gigantic detectors .",
    "there are many theoretical models predicting large luminosity of cosmic sources in high - energy particles , including neutrinos  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , such fluxes may be produced in supernova explosions , in active galactic nuclei , during gamma - ray bursts etc .",
    "energy outburst in these sources , including in the form of _ he _  particles , may be really high , but the expected flux at the earth remains low due to large distance .    basically , there are two models of _ he",
    "_  particle production .",
    "first assumes proton acceleration up to very high energies on cosmic source shocks ( usually gas accretion onto a massive black hole , presumably residing in center of an active galaxy , is suggested ) , sometimes in relativistic jets pointing to the earth . then pions and kaons appear as a result of @xmath20- and/or @xmath21-collisions in a source .",
    "these mesons decay , giving birth to _ he _",
    ". the described scenario is called _ down - top _ mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to obtain proton energies higher than @xmath22  ev in this mechanism ; one needs both large shock radius and high magnetic field .",
    "another possibility is proposed by the _ top - down _ mechanism ( for review and discussion of upper limits to the expected @xmath6-fluxes see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is based on suggestion that some yet unknown , extremely massive ( with @xmath23  gev ) long - living gauge @xmath24-bosons decay to the ordinary particles .",
    "these bosons allegedly originate from topological defects , which in their turn have been produced during a hypothetical phase transition in the early universe . a big fraction of @xmath24-boson s energy goes to _ he _  particles ( neutrinos ) .",
    "these attractive models involve new physics beyond standard model and seem a bit speculative .",
    "an experimental verification is needed .",
    "neutrino  detectors should be very large and well shielded from background radiations .",
    "the are to have either @xmath25  km@xmath26 , especially if secondary muons ( say from @xmath27 ) are detected , and/or gigantic mass , @xmath28  ton , in the case of registration using nuclear - electromagnetic cascades ( from hadron state @xmath24 in the @xmath29 case or from @xmath30 ) .",
    "these requirements may be met :    * by search for cerenkov radiation in deep underwater detectors with desirable volume under control @xmath31  km@xmath32 ( mass @xmath33  ton ) ; * by registration of air nitrogen fluorescence , induced by extended air showers ; an effective control over @xmath34  ton of atmosphere may be achieved either from the earth ( see fly s eye @xcite and hires @xcite ) or from satellites ( airwatch @xcite etc ) ; * using such a neutrino detector , as _ pierre auger _",

    "the rate of nucleon - electromagnetic cascades in a neutrino  detector is proportional to convolution product of @xmath3-cross - sections  and @xmath6-fluxes , and also to the number of scattering centers , i.e.  mass of detector .",
    "a standard requirement is to have at least @xmath39 events per year , but the only way to gain higher statistics is to increase the installation mass .",
    "but huge arrays are very expensive . however , the higher are @xmath3-cross - section , the higher is the expected rate of events , the better results may be obtained .",
    "a severe problem for _ hena _  is high _ cr _  background .",
    "one is to shield a detector either burying it deep underground ( underwater , underice ) or selecting just down - up going events , using the earth as a shield . in any case , the atmospheric neutrino  background ( mostly from prompt @xmath6 s ) is inevitable .",
    "nevertheless , many @xmath6-source models suggest that extragalactic diffuse @xmath6-flux dominates at @xmath40  ev .",
    "we shall discuss several consequences for _ hena _  of accelerated growth of neutrino - nucleon  cross - sections  at extremely high energies .",
    "we argue that such acceleration may be induced by non - perturbative hard pomeron with intercept @xmath41 , which was proposed and successfully exploited in series of recent papers by a. donnachie and p. v. landshoff @xcite .",
    "we study its influence on the rate of cascades in a @xmath6-detector and on evolution of neutrino  spectra during their pass through large column depths of matter .",
    "neutrino - nucleon scatterings proceed via @xmath42 and @xmath5 interactions : @xmath43where @xmath44 .",
    "high energy behavior of @xmath3-cross - sections  is yet unknown .",

    "@xcite a new parameterization of these _ sfs _  has been derived .",
    "it was grounded on a successful description of @xmath2 by a. donnachie and p. v. landshoff @xcite , which claimed that small-@xmath0 @xmath49-scattering data of _ hera _ @xcite may be successfully explained with the help of a simple combination of several regge theory inspired leading pole terms .",

    "so , in the case of power - law decreasing spectra ( [ spectra ] ) , differential and integral rates of cascade production in a detector may be calculated with the help of so - called demensionless differential , @xmath70 and integral , @xmath71 hadron moments @xcite . here",

    "an appropriate variable for such consideration is column depth , @xmath94 ( measured in @xmath95 ) .",

    "on the one hand , the higher is the energy , the stronger is attenuation . on the other hand ,",
    "earth is the natural , but not the unique example of a large column depth of matter in the universe .",
    "one can easily imagine different environments with much higher column depths , where neutrino flux attenuations would be stronger as well .",

    "ten years later it was proposed by a. nicolaidis and a. taramopoulos in ref .",
