    "dynamic stochasticity @xcite  occurs in the region of parameter values , where topologically different trajectories adjoin each other .",
    "trajectories near the boundary are highly sensitive to small disturbances . for small disturbances",
    "these trajectories take a very complicated shape , which is one of the manifestations of stochasticity .",
    "an elementary example of such systems is a pendulum that may perform two kinds of motion - oscillatory and rotational .",
    "this explains in the main a growing interest in physical processes in which motion reduces to pendulum type motions .",
    "a quantum analogue of dynamic stochasticity - quantum chaos @xcite  occurs in the same region of parameter values where dynamic stochasticity does . in that case ,",
    "the quantum states of two different symmetries adjoin each other .",
    "a highly complicated process takes place in a neighborhood of the boundary - the energy spectrum corresponding to the symmetry of one kind transforms to the energy spectrum of the other kind , which , in turn , demands the removal of degeneration corresponding to the symmetry of one kind and the appearance of degeneration corresponding to the symmetry of second kind . in the energy spectrum graph",
    "this process is represented by the set of branch points and merged energy levels . in passing through these points ,",
    "the system may lose information on the initial conditions and pass from the pure state to the mixed one .",
    "the mixed state thus formed will be the state expressing quantum chaos . from that moment of time ,",
    "the state of the system is not any longer described by a wave function and it becomes necessary to describe it by a density matrix @xcite .    frequently , the objects of quantum chaos realization are polyatomic molecules @xcite . for example , quantum chaos may take place in a polyatomic molecule , one of the generalized coordinates of which performs torsional oscillations which , with an increase of the amplitude , transform to rotational motion @xcite .",
    "quantum chaos is a characteristic feature of such a transitional region .    from the standpoint of quantum chaos it is of special interest to investigate the so - called floppy molecules which have a capacity to isomerization @xcite .",
    "an example of such molecules is lithium cyanide ( linc ) .",
    "this molecule contains a firm fragment  @xmath1  with a triple bond and a relatively light lithium atom ( li ) which is able to perform angular oscillations relative to the molecule axis .",
    "when the oscillation amplitude attains the threshold value , the lithium atom detaches itself from the nitrogen atom and passes over to the carbon atom ( fig.1a ) . at higher energies",
    ", it again returns to the nitrogen atom and there begins the alternating jump - over process , i.e. , the lithium atom begins to rotate about the fragment  @xmath1 .",
    "the energy spectrum of lithium atom motion was studied by the numerical methods in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the energy spectrum consists of equidistant and nonequidistant regions .",
    "the energy levels arranged in a nonequidistant manner correspond to lithium atom states at which the oscillatory mode of motion transforms to the rotational one .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the energy spectrum of lithium atom motion relative to the firm fragment  @xmath1 . as different from the papers @xcite ,  which are based mainly on the numerical methods , our approach to the problem is analytical : using numerical data we approximate the potential energy of the lithium atom and study the energy spectrum by the analysis of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the lithium atom motion relative to the firm fragment  @xmath2  can be described by means of two coordinates _",
    "r _ and @xmath3  only ( fig.1b ) .",

    "the angle @xmath3 is laid off along the abscissa axis , and the potential energy in atom units @xmath12 is laid off along the ordinate axis . ,",
    "width=302 ]    it can be easily verified that the potential energy of isomerization is approximated by the formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the points of a minimum of the potential energy @xmath15 are @xmath16 , while the points of a maximum @xmath17 . if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 .",
    "this means that minima vanish at points @xmath20 , while maxima adjacent to them merge .",

    "the expression ( 1 ) does not take into account the radial motion of the lithium atom , which is assumed to be at some average distance from the fragment @xmath1 .",
    "let us first consider the lithium atom motion relative to the firm fragment @xmath1 in classical terms . for the sake of simplicity , we will study this motion for energy @xmath40 . as will be seen later",
    ", these energy values include the oscillation and rotation modes which we are interested in .    to obtain the motion equation",
    ", we write the energy integral    @xmath41    using this integral of motion we can obtain a period of the lithium atom rotation about the fragment @xmath1    @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a eliptic function of first order .",
    "when @xmath47 in the limit from above we have @xmath48,@xmath49 ,  @xmath50 , and the rotation period @xmath51 therefore as @xmath52 the rotation period logarithmically tends to infinity .",
    "analogosously , we can calculate the oscillatory motion period @xmath53 .",
    "these calculations are not given here .",
    "we only note the oscillatory motion period , too , diverges logarithmically when @xmath54 ,  i.e. , if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 .    as a rule ,",
    "the existence of a logarithmically diverging period indicates the presence of two different modes of motion and the existence of a boundary trajectory - separatrix between them .",
    "this means that the separatrix appears to be obtained at energies @xmath56 .    using the expression ( 4 )",
    "we can construct the phase portrait on the plane @xmath57 . as seen from fig.4 ,",
    "the phase portrait consists of closed ( elliptic ) trajectories , which correspond to the oscillatory process , and wave trajectories describing rotational motion .",
    "the alternation of elliptic trajectories of two different dimensions on the @xmath3-axis is caused by the presence of two different minima of potential energy .",
    "thus we see that lithium atoms may have two types of motion - oscillatory when @xmath58 and rotatory when @xmath59 .",
    "as seen from the figure these two types of motion are divided by the separatrix .    -",
    "let us now consider the motion of the lithium atom relative to the fragment @xmath1 from the standpoint of quantum mechanics .",
    "we replace the hamiltonian function ( 1 ) by the hamilton operator    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is a pulse operator .",
    "then the schrdinger equation takes the form    @xmath62    we make the replacement @xmath63 and introduce the notation @xmath64 then , by simple transformations , from the equation ( 6 ) we obtain @xmath65\\psi=0.\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our consideration to the investigation of the dependence of energy levels on one ( and not on two ) parameter and to this end we introduce the parameter @xmath66 into ( 7 ) .",
    "this relationship is studied assuming @xmath67 and @xmath68 to be given values .",
    "the energy spectrum of the initial problem is obtained at @xmath69 .",
    "the schrdinger equation takes the form known as the hill equation which in turn implies the mathieu equation as @xmath70 . using the known methods @xcite ,",
    "solutions of this equation are sought for in the form of fourier series @xmath71 substituting these values into the equation ( 7 ) and equating the coefficients of the same harmonic , we obtain recurrent relations for the coefficients @xmath72 ,  @xmath73 ,  @xmath74,@xmath75 , ( their upper indexes are omitted ) .",
    "for example , for the first series of ( 8) these relations have the form : @xmath76 this is an infinite system of equations that establishes a relation between the coefficients @xmath72 . in order that this system would have a nontrivial solution",
    "it is necessary that @xmath77 , where @xmath78\\delta_{ij}-\\lambda{q_1\\delta_{i+1;j}}-\\lambda{q_2\\delta_{i+2;j}}-\\lambda{q_1\\delta_{i;j+1}}-\\lambda{q_2\\delta_{i;j+2}}-\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\lambda{q_1\\delta_{i;2}\\delta_{j;1}}-\\lambda{q_2\\delta_{i;3}\\delta_{j;1}}-\\lambda{q_2\\delta_{i;2}\\delta_{j;2}},\\ i=1\\ldots\\infty,\\ j=1\\ldots\\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are elements of the matrix composed of the coefficients of the system of equations ( 9 ) and written by means of the kronecker symbol .",
    "analogously , we obtain recurrent relations for the coefficients @xmath73 ,  @xmath74 and @xmath75 , matrix determinants and characteristic equations , the numerical solution of which gives the energy spectrum .",
    "to obtain a quantitative estimate of the energy spectrum , we have to calculate first the numerical values of the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 contained in the mathieu - hill equation ( 7 ) .    applying the obtained values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , taking into consideration the carbon , nitrogen and lithium mass values ( @xmath79  @xmath80@xmath81 ) and also the values of the linear parameters @xmath82 and @xmath6 from @xcite(@xmath83 @xmath84 ) , we obtain , by means of the equations ( 2),@xmath85 and @xmath86 . using the obtained values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the numerical solutions of the characteristic equation",
    ", we can construct the energy spectrum as a function of mathieu characteristics @xmath87 ( fig.5 ) .    as seen from fig.5a , for low energies we have levels arranged equidistantly , which corresponds to oscillations of the lithium atom near the nitrogen molecule , i.e. , to oscillatory motion in a deep ( @xmath4 ) pit ( fig.3 ) . when the lithium atom energy is @xmath88 , the alternating transition from one pit to the other and vice versa takes place . in fig.5 to this transition there correspond levels arranged nonequidistantly . the spectrum obtained by us",
    "qualitatively coincides with the picture obtained in @xcite . in both cases",
    "nonequidistant levels appear in the same intervals of energy .    .",

    "finding of energy spectrum of states which corresponds to the process of isomerization comes to the finding of proper values of mathieu - hill equation .",
    "the energy spectrum of lithium atom motion includes a region @xmath89 , where levels are arranged equidistantly .",
    "these levels correspond to small oscillations of the lithium atom near isomeric states .",
    "levels arranged nonequidistantly begin for relatively high energies , when the energy level reaches half of the barrier height and exceeds @xmath90 .",
    "it should be noted that the system considered in the paper is integrable .",
    "therefore the generality of nonequidistant ( chaotic ) levels is not the manifestation of quantum chaos though it may appear when these states are disturbed by periodic force as illustrated by the example of a quantum pendulum @xcite .",
