    "the definition of rizov @xcite*definition 1.7 is that @xmath249 is a cm field ( without any condition on @xmath661 ) .",
    "he shows @xcite*corollary 3.19 that if @xmath7 has complex multiplication ( in his sense ) with hodge endomorphism algebra @xmath249 then @xmath7 is defined over an abelian extension of @xmath249 .",
    "[ thm : cmpotgoodred ] let @xmath7 be a cm k3 surface ( in the sense of definition [ def : cmk3 ] ) , which is defined over some number field , say @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath662 be any prime of @xmath2 such that its residue characteristic @xmath1 satisfies @xmath9 for some ample line bundle @xmath8 on @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath7 has potential good reduction at @xmath662 ( with an algebraic space model ) .",
    "this is also a generalization ( for large @xmath1 ) of a previous result of ours on exceptional k3 surfaces .",
    "exceptional k3 surfaces are the k3 surfaces in characteristic @xmath12 of picard number @xmath663 ( which is the maximum possible value in characteristic @xmath12 ) and they are examples of cm k3 surfaces .",

    "since the galois action preserves @xmath665 , the image of @xmath28 in @xmath666 is contained in @xmath667 . since @xmath660",
    ", we have @xmath668 .",
    "this group is abelian and contains a pro-@xmath0 group of finite index .    since @xmath669 is abelian , the action of @xmath670 factors through @xmath671 . under the reciprocity map @xmath672 of the local class field theory , the image of the inertia group @xmath673 in @xmath671 is isomorphic to @xmath674 , a group which contains a pro-@xmath1-group of finite index .",
    "since @xmath5 , it follows that the image of @xmath673 in @xmath667 is finite .",
