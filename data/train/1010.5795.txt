    "the geometry of curves and surfaces in @xmath1 represented for many years a popular topic in the field of classical differential geometry .",
    "global and local properties were studied in several books and new invariants were defined for curves as well as for surfaces .",
    "an old and important problem in differential geometry of curves and surfaces is that of bertrand  lancret  de saint venant saying that a curve in the euclidean @xmath0space @xmath1 is of constant slope , namely its tangent makes a constant angle with a fixed direction , if and only if the ratio of torsion @xmath2 and curvature @xmath3 is constant .",
    "these curves are also called _",
    "generalized helices_. if both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are non - zero constants the curve is called _",
    "circular helix_. other interesting curves in @xmath1 are _ slant helices _",
    ", characterized by the property that the principal normals make a constant angle with a fixed direction .",
    "the problem of bertrand  lancret  de saint venant was generalized for curves in other 3-dimensional manifolds  in particular space forms or sasakian manifolds .",
    "such a curve has the property that its tangent makes constant angle with a parallel vector field on the manifold or with a killing vector field respectively .",
    "for example , a curve @xmath4 in a @xmath0dimensional space form is called a _ general helix _ if there exists a killing vector field @xmath5 with constant length along @xmath6 and such that the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a non - zero constant .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it is shown that general helices in a @xmath0dimensional space form are extremal curves of a functional involving a linear combination of the curvature , the torsion ( as functions ) and a constant .",
    "on the other hand , in a contact @xmath0manifold , a curve is called a _ slant curve _ if the angle between its tangent and the reeb vector field is constant ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "general helices , also called lancret curves are used in many applications ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bertrand studied curves in euclidean space @xmath1 whose principal normals are also the principal normals of another curve ( called bertrand mate ) .",
    "such a curve is nowadays called a bertrand curve and it is characterized by a linear relation between its curvature and torsion .",
    "bertrand mates in @xmath1 are particular examples of offset curves used in computer - aided geometric design ( see e.g. @xcite ) . due to previous characterization",
    ", one may say that bertrand curves are strictly related with weigarten surfaces .",
    "possible applications of weingarten surfaces are found in @xcite .    passing from curves to surfaces ,",
    "a natural question is to find which surfaces in @xmath0dimensional space make constant angle with certain vector fields .",
    "for example in @xcite it is given a new approach to classify surfaces in @xmath1 making a constant angle with a fixed direction .",
    "these surfaces were called _",
    "constant angle surfaces _ and they appear in the study of liquid crystals and of layered fluids @xcite . recently , the geometry of constant angle surfaces was developed in other @xmath0dimensional spaces as @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , the heisenberg group @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , minkowski @xmath0space @xcite , a.s.o .",
    "on the other hand , in analogy with the geometry of logarithmic spirals , in @xcite there were found all surfaces in @xmath1 whose normals make constant angle with the position vector .",
    "particular surfaces with beautiful shapes were obtained .",
    "the main part of the paper is devoted to the study of surfaces whose normals make constant angle @xmath13 with killing vectors in @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain the complete classification of these surfaces , which includes : halfplanes having @xmath14axis as boundary , rotational surfaces around @xmath14axis , right cylinders over logarithmic spirals and dini s surfaces .",
    "regarding dini s surfaces as a particular kind of helicoidal surfaces , on this broader class of surfaces many studies were made , let us mention for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . classification and characterization results were obtained having as starting point the fact that helicoidal surfaces are applicable upon rotational surfaces .",
    "for more recent developments and approaches on curves and surfaces , see for example @xcite .",
    "different types of helicoidal surfaces were investigated also recently in other ambient spaces as minkowski space @xcite , or the product space @xmath15 , @xcite .",
    "the study of these surfaces did not stop only in the field of classical differential geometry .",
    "also interesting computer graphics results concerning helicoidal surfaces were obtained in e.g. @xcite .",
    "we conclude the present paper with a new characterization of dini s surfaces in terms of constant angle surfaces .",
    "in the first part of this section we bring to light new properties of planar and spatial curves involving the _ angle of two curves_. since the result is local , let us consider two curves @xmath6 and @xmath17 , without self - intersections , parameterized by the same parameter @xmath18 . for an arbitrary @xmath19 , we define the angle @xmath13 ( at @xmath20 ) of @xmath6 and @xmath17 as the angle of the tangent vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the corresponding point .",
    "interesting problems appear when the angle @xmath13 is constant .",
    "let us point our attention first on two planar curves which lie in the same plane .",
    "a particular case arises when one of the curves is a straight line .",
    "if the other curve makes constant angle with this line , it is also a straight line .",
    "a second case occurs when we are looking for planar curves @xmath6 which make a constant angle with the unit circle @xmath23 .",
    "take @xmath24 arc length parameterized and the unit circle @xmath23 parameterized with the same parameter as @xmath6 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a smooth function defined on @xmath27 .",
    "notice that , in general , the arc length parameters for the two curves are not the same .",
    "denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 the unit tangent vectors to @xmath23 and to the curve @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the angle between @xmath6 and @xmath23 is @xmath30 and it will be a constant @xmath31 .",
    "it follows that @xmath32 straightforward computations yield the parametrization of the curve @xmath6 @xmath33 after a translation in @xmath34 .",
    "if we denote @xmath35 , then the parametrization can be rewritten as @xmath36 in order to give a geometric interpretation of the above formula , let us take a look at figure  [ mn : curba_cerc ] where the the angle @xmath37 , the function @xmath38 and @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "+    if the curve @xmath40 ( green ) makes constant angle @xmath41 with the circle @xmath23 ( magenta ) , then the curve @xmath6 ( blue ) represents the rotation with angle @xmath42 of @xmath40 in clockwise direction .",
    "the line segments represent pairs of tangent vectors to the curve @xmath6 and respectively to the circle @xmath23 .    in the same manner",
    "we investigate now the spatial curves .",
    "the first question that arises is to find spatial curves @xmath6 which make a constant angle with a straight line and a classical result tells us that @xmath6 is a _",
    "helix_. without loss of generality the line can be taken to be ( parallel with ) one of the coordinate axes .",
    "but this is an integral curve of a killing vector vector field in @xmath43 .",
    "motivated by these remarks , a natural question springs up : _ which curves make a constant angle with a killing vector field in @xmath44 _ ?",
    "let us briefly recall that a vector field @xmath7 in @xmath44 is killing if and only if it satisfies the killing equation : @xmath45 for any vector fields @xmath46 , @xmath47 in @xmath44 , where @xmath48 denotes the euclidean connection on @xmath44 .",
    "the set of solutions of this equation is @xmath49 and it gives a basis of killing vector fields in @xmath44 .",
    "here @xmath50 denote the global coordinates on @xmath44 and @xmath51 regarded as a vector space .    as we have mentioned before , spatial curves which make a constant angle with any of the killing vector fields @xmath52 are helices .",
    "regarding the other three killing vector fields , the problem is basically the same for each of them and let us choose for example @xmath53 .",
    "we study first planar curves @xmath6 ( in @xmath54plane ) defined by which make a constant angle @xmath13 with the killing vector field @xmath7 .",
    "since the curve @xmath6 is parameterized by arc length , the unit tangent vector is given by @xmath55 . since @xmath56",
    ", the condition @xmath57 can be rewritten as @xmath58 a convenient way of handling @xmath6 is to consider its polar parametrization , @xmath59 and then equation becomes @xmath60 using now the fact that @xmath6 is parameterized by arc length and combining it with the previous condition , we get after integration    if @xmath61 : @xmath62 and @xmath63    if @xmath64 : @xmath65 and @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we state now the following theorem :    a curve lying in the @xmath69-plane and making constant angle with the killing vector @xmath70 is    * either the circle @xmath71 centered in the origin and of radius @xmath72 * or a straight line passing through the origin * or the logarithmic spiral @xmath73 .",
    "this is not a surprising fact since the circle @xmath71 is an integral curve for @xmath7 and the logarithmic spiral , known also as _ the equiangular spiral _ ,",
    "is characterized by the property that the angle between its tangent and the radial direction at every point is constant .",
    "moreover , the position vector @xmath74 and the vector @xmath75 are orthogonal .",
    "if @xmath6 is a spatial curve making a constant angle with the killing vector field @xmath7 , let us consider @xmath76 given in cylindrical coordinates as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is again arc length parameter .",
    "we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "similarly as in previous situation , the property @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 again , since @xmath6 is parameterized by arc length , we get @xmath83 . hence , there exists a function @xmath84 such that @xmath85 integrating once and combining with we may formulate the following theorem :    a curve @xmath6 in the euclidean space @xmath16 which makes a constant angle with the killing vector @xmath70 is given , in cylindrical coordinates , up to vertical translations and rotations around @xmath86-axis , by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is a smooth function on @xmath27 .",
    "let us mention some particular cases for function @xmath89 .",
    "( we will take @xmath13 different from @xmath90 and @xmath91 . )    * the function @xmath92 is constant . * * if @xmath93 , then @xmath6 is a plane curve given by the logarithmic spiral @xmath94 . * * if @xmath95 , then @xmath6 lies on the cone @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , the projection of @xmath6 on the @xmath54plane is the logarithmic spiral @xmath97 .",
    "( see figure  [ fspira1 ] . ) * if @xmath89 is an affine function , @xmath98 , then parametrization represents a curve on the @xmath99sphere centered in origin with radius @xmath100 .",

    "in this section we are interested to find all _ surfaces in euclidean @xmath104-space which make a constant angle with the killing vector field @xmath7_.      a good motivation to study this problem is given by the particular case @xmath107 . let the surface @xmath108 be parameterized by @xmath109 given by a graph @xmath110 computing the normal to the surface and imposing for the vector field @xmath7 to be tangent to the surface in this case , namely to be orthogonal to the unit normal @xmath111 , one gets @xmath112 . hence , the surfaces for which @xmath7 makes a constant angle @xmath113 are given by with @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is an arbitrary real valued function ; they are rotational surfaces .",

    "projecting @xmath7 onto the tangent plane to @xmath108 one has @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the tangent part with @xmath130 and @xmath131 . at this point",
    "we may choose an orthonormal basis @xmath132 on the tangent plane to @xmath108 such that @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
