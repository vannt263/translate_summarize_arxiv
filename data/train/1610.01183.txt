    "the fact that neutrinos have tiny non - zero mass is well established from the various neutrino oscillation experiments and the study of neutrino physics has entered the precision era .",
    "the standard 3-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario has six key parameters and these are , two @xmath3 differences ( @xmath4 ) , three mixing angles ( @xmath5 ) and the cp phase @xmath6 .",
    "global analysis of neutrino oscillation data provide the best - fit values and @xmath7 ranges of these parameters and are given in @xcite . the remaining unknown in neutrino oscillation physics",
    "are ( a ) the sign of @xmath8(@xmath9 , known as normal hierarchy ( nh ) or @xmath10 , known as inverted hierarchy ( ih ) ) , ( b ) the octant of @xmath0 ( @xmath11 , known as lower octant ( lo ) or @xmath12 , known as higher octant ( ho ) ) and ( c ) the cp phase @xmath13 .",
    "information on these unknown parameters can come from the currently running long baseline experiments like t2k @xcite and no@xmath14a  @xcite .",
    "but the main problems which these experiments have to overcome is the issue of parameter degeneracies by which it is meant that different set of parameters can provide equally good fit to the data .    in this letter",
    "our main focus is on the resolution of octant degeneracy using next generation superbeam experiment dune .",
    "currently , neutrino oscillation experiment , like , t2k gives the most accurate measurements of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the prime channel for this parameter is the disappearance channel @xmath15 . for baselines shorter than 1000 km",
    "this channel has an intrinsic octant degeneracy because of the presence of @xmath16 in the leading order term of the probability expression . whereas the probability expression of @xmath17 channel depends on the combination of @xmath18 and",
    "hence does not suffer from intrinsic degeneracy but has generalized degeneracies which were addressed in @xcite . here , our main goal is to understand the role of antineutrinos in enhancing the octant sensitivity of dune experiment .",
    "it was observed that the main complication that arises in octant determination is due to the unknown value of @xmath13 in the subleading terms of @xmath17 channel which gives rise to octant-@xmath13 degeneracy .",
    "it was discussed in @xcite that combining the reactor measurement of @xmath19 with the accelerator data will be beneficial for extraction of information on the octant value from the @xmath17 channel .",
    "the combined measurement of @xmath15 channel with @xmath17 channel in long baseline experiments can also be helpful in determining the octant degeneracy because of the non - identical functional dependence of the two probabilities on @xmath0 .",
    "we present the results of the octant sensitivity using various combinations of ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) run as a function of true @xmath13 for fixed values of true @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we also present the precision of @xmath0 in ( true:@xmath0 - test:@xmath0 ) plane .",
    "the details of numerical simulation and experimental specifications that we have considered are given in @xcite and the references there in .",
    "in this section we discuss the octant sensitivity of dune experiment . we get four possibilities of ( hierarchy@xmath22octant ) depending on the true parameters and which are , nh - lo , nh - ho , ih - lo and ih - ho . here , we only discuss the cases nh - lo and ih - lo . details and the remaining 2 cases are describe in @xcite . here , in the first column dark - blue curves represents true : nh - test : nh and magenta curves represents true : nh - test : ih and in the second column dark - blue curves represents true : ih - test : ih . in both the plots the horizontal yellow line represents the octant sensitivity at 3@xmath23 c.l .",
    "representative true value of @xmath24 for this two plots are 39@xmath25(lo ) .",
    "let consider the case for nh - lo , from the left column of fig.([fig : oct_discovery ] ) we can see that [ 10 + 0 ] year @xmath20 run of dune can resolve octant degeneracy at 3@xmath23 c.l.(solid blue curve ) if the hierarchy is known .",
    "the main point to notice here is that , though only neutrino run suffers from octant degeneracy , still we get octant sensitivity around 3@xmath23 .",
    "this is one of the special features of the on axis beam based neutrino oscillation experiment where the degeneracy does not exist over the complete energy range and one can still have some octant sensitivity only from the neutrino channel .",
    "however , storyline changes if the hierarchy is unknown then there is a wrong hierarchy(wh)-wrong octant(wo ) solutions in the region @xmath26 .",
    "we see that once antineutrino run added , say [ 7 + 3 ] years of ( @xmath27 ) run , octant degeneracy can be resolved with more than 4@xmath23 c.l . even without the knowledge of the true hierarchy for all values of @xmath13 .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : th23_precision ] we plot the @xmath28 precision contours in the ( true:@xmath0 - test:@xmath0 ) plane for true @xmath29 ( left column ) and @xmath30 ( right column ) for normal hierarchy ( for inverted hierarchy see the discussion on @xcite ) .",
    "both these figures demonstrate the relation between precision of @xmath0 and octant degeneracy . from these plots",
    "we see that only for neutrino run ( i.e ( 10 + 0 ) ) there are other allowed values of @xmath0 apart from the true value , if @xmath31 lo ( ho ) at @xmath32 .",
    "this happens because of the existence of octant degeneracy . as we have seen from fig.([fig : oct_discovery ] ) that for @xmath32 , neutrinos suffer from octant degeneracy in lo ( ho ) and this in turn affects the precision of @xmath0 which is clearly seen from this figures .",
    "here , we see that the addition of antineutrinos help to improve the precision in both [ 7 + 3 ] and [ 5 + 5 ] curves and both the curves give almost similar precision of @xmath0 . but",
    "as one approaches the maximal value of @xmath0 from non - maximal value , the precision becomes worse due to the difficulty in determining the octant around @xmath0 maximal .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have explored the significant role of antineutrinos in giving an enhanced octant sensitivity in next generation superbeam experiment dune which has a 1300 km baseline with a broad - band beam . in our study",
    ", we observe that although for some specific parameters only neutrino run can provide @xmath7 octant sensitivity , overall combined ( @xmath27 ) run gives better sensitivity .",
