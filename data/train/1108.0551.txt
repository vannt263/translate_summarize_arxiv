    "( rational ) conformal field theories @xcite not only play a special role within string theory , but they are also interesting objects in their own right , since they appear in many other contests such as in condensed matter physics .",
    "+ standard ways are known to derive new conformal field theories from existing ones .",
    "the prototype is the _ orbifold _ cft of the form @xmath1 : given a current algebra @xmath2 , one mods out its symmetry subalgebra @xmath3 , leaving only @xmath3-invariant states plus twisted fields , necessary for modular invariance .",
    "much is known about these coset models . +",
    "another prototype example is the extension via _ integer spin simple currents _ ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "extensions are very powerful tools in string theory , since they allow to perform projections ( e.g. gso projection ) , impose constraints ( such as the @xmath4-constraints in gepner models ) or implement field identifications in coset models .",
    "an extension is an orbifold - like procedure , that is possible to apply when the cft has got",
    "_ simple currents _ with integer spin . +",
    "a simple current @xmath5 is by definition a special field of the theory with simple fusion rules ,",
    "@xmath6 having only one contribution on the r.h.s . in practice , what one does in extensions is modding out the discrete symmetry generated by @xmath7 , being @xmath8 the monodromy charge of the field @xmath9 with respect to the simple current @xmath5 .",
    "one is left with zero - charge _ orbits _ under @xmath5 of the form @xmath10 , for some integer @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath11 is called the order of @xmath5 .",
    "it can happen sometimes that @xmath12 for some field @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath13 will be then called a _ fixed point _ of j. + fixed points are very delicate objects to handle . in the new , or _ extended _",
    ", theory each fixed point gives rise to _ splitted _ fields , in number equal to the order of the current , on which there is a priori no control . as a consequence",
    ", the extended @xmath14 matrix , @xmath15 , can not be immediately expressed in terms of the @xmath14 matrix of the original theory .",
    "instead , one has to introduce a set of new matrices , the so - called @xmath16 matrices , one for each simple current @xmath5 , in terms of which @xmath15 is parametrized as @xcite : @xmath17 in this formula , the index @xmath18 labels the @xmath19 field into which @xmath20 is splitted ; the prefactor is a group - theoretical quantity , acting as a normalization ; the @xmath21 are the group characters acting as phases ; the sum is over all the simple currents used to extend the original theory",
    ". + the @xmath16 matrices act only on fixed points of @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath22 if either @xmath20 or @xmath23 is not fixed by @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , modular invariance of the full @xmath15 matrix implies modular invariance of @xmath16 : @xmath24 hence , in this formalism , the problem of determining the extended @xmath14 matrix is equivalent to finding the set of @xmath16 matrices .",
    "this is known as the _ fixed point resolution _ problem .",
    "theories for which the @xmath16 matrices were already known in the past include wzw models and coset theories .",
    "recently , the fixed point problem has been solved for the cyclic permutation orbifold , in the simplified case of two factors : @xmath25 the @xmath26 exchanging the two factors .",
    "@xmath27 denotes an arbitrary cft .",
    "+ the field content of the generic permutation orbifold was already known from @xcite .",
    "it consists of three kinds of fields : _ diagonal _ , @xmath28 , _ off - diagonal _ , @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and _ twisted _ , @xmath31 .",
    "also the @xmath14 matrix of this orbifold was already known from @xcite in terms of the @xmath14 and @xmath32 matrices of the original cft @xmath27 .",
    "we will denote it by @xmath33 .",
    "+ if one is interested in performing extensions of this cyclic orbifold , the first thing that must be asked is whether or not it admits simple currents and , in affirmative case , if the simple currents have fixed points .",
    "it turns out that the answers to both questions is yes @xcite .",
    "orbifold simple currents are diagonal fields corresponding to the simple currents of the original cft , while their fixed points can be of any kind .",
    "hence , one has to resolve those fixed points or , equivalently , determine the corresponding @xmath16 matrices .",
    "one possible strategy is to give an _ ansatz _ for @xmath16 which satisfies modular invariance and furthermore is subject to the following constraints :    * for the identity current , @xmath34 , @xmath16 must reduce to @xmath33 ; * the extension by the anti - symmetric component of the identity undoes the permutation orbifold , giving back the tensor product @xmath35 @xcite ; * the @xmath16 must be consistent with known expressions existing for some wzw models with particular current algebras ( e.g. @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "the explicit expression for the ansatz is given in @xcite .",
    "there , it is also shown that unitarity and modular invariance are satisfied .",
    "moreover , integrality of the fusion rules has been checked numerically for very large rational cft s , even though its proof is probably doable .",
    "all these non - trivial checks strongly suggest that this is indeed the correct answer .",
    "the previously derived formalism has been applied to four dimensional string theory compactifications in the context of gepner models @xcite .",
    "gepner models are built out of tensor products of an external four - dimensional spacetime part and an internal @xmath39 conformal field theory with @xmath0 worldsheet supersymmetry .",
    "the internal sector itself consists of tensor products of @xmath40 @xmath0 minimal models , where additional constraints are imposed in order to guarantee worldsheet and spacetime supersymmetry .",
    "these constraints are just extensions of the tensor product by specific integer - spin simple currents . in the @xmath41 minimal model ( @xmath42 ) the relevant fields are the worldsheet supersymmetry current @xmath43 with weight @xmath44 and the spectral flow operator @xmath45 with weight @xmath46 .",
    "the currents that impose the gepner constraints are then @xmath47 for the worldsheet supersymmetry , where @xmath43 appears in position @xmath9 , and @xmath48 for the spacetime supersymmetry . here ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath14 denote the vector and spinor currents of the @xmath50 which is introduced by the bosonic string map .    if two matrices are not currently available .",
    "] of the factors in the tensor product are identical , we can then replace them by their permutation orbifold .",
    "performing extensions and permutations in the product of two identical minimal models , we discover that @xcite :    * the current @xmath51 makes the tensor product supersymmetric on the worldsheet ; * the current @xmath52 is the worldsheet supersymmetry current of the permutation orbifold , making the permutation orbifold supersymmetric on the worldsheet ; the following scheme summarizes the structure : @xmath53^{bhs } \\ar[r]^{t_f\\otimes t_f } & \\boxed{(n=2)^2_{\\rm susy } } \\ar@/^/@2{->}[d]^{\\rm super - bhs } \\\\",
    "\\boxed{(n=2)^2_{\\rm orb } } \\ar@/^/@{.>}[u]^{(0,1 ) } \\ar[r]^{(t_f,1)\\quad } & \\boxed{(n=2)^2_{\\rm susy - orb } } \\ar@/^/@{.>}[u]^{(0,1 ) } } \\ ] ] here `` super - bhs '' denotes the analogous bhs mechanism carried out in the supersymmetric tensor product . *",
    "the current @xmath54 is _ not _ the worldsheet supersymmetry current of the permutation orbifold , but extends it into a new non - supersymmetric cft @xmath55 ; the summarizing graph is below : @xmath53^{bhs } \\ar[r]^{t_f\\otimes t_f } & \\boxed{(n=2)^2_{\\rm susy } }   \\\\ \\boxed{(n=2)^2_{\\rm orb } }   \\ar@/^/@{.>}[u]^{(0,1 ) } \\ar[r]^{(t_f,0)\\quad } & \\boxed{{\\rm non - susy}\\,\\,x } \\ar[u]^{(0,1 ) } } \\ ] ] * in the @xmath56-extended orbifold ( @xmath57 ) , `` exceptional '' simple currents appear as a consequence of the extension procedure ; they are exceptional in the sense that they generate from off - diagonal fields in the mother cft , hence a priori not expected ; moreover , in some cases , they admit fixed points , which must then be resolved .",
    "when considering string compactifications , we can now use the permutation orbifold of minimal models ( and their extensions ) to construct new four dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "the oldest approach is to use the heterotic string , where families of chiral fermions come out automatically in representations of @xmath58-based gut models . by breaking the gut gauge symmetry group",
    "one can study various features , such as the presence of fractionally - charged particles and the abundance of three - family models .",
    "the relevant results are the following .    *",
    "the gauge groups that are considered are the gut group @xmath58 and seven rank-5 subgroups , namely : * * the pati - salam group @xmath59 , * * the georgi - glashow gut group @xmath60 , * * two global realizations of the left - right symmetric algebra @xmath61 , called @xmath62 and @xmath63 , * * three global realizations of the standard model algebra @xmath64 , called @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "+ the last two lie algebras are distinguished by their fractional charged representations ( hence @xmath68 denotes the quantization of the elementary charge ) .",
    "these eight gauge groups are obtained as simple current extensions of the standard model affine lie algebra @xmath69 . * despite the fact that no evidence for fractional charged particles exists in nature , with a limit of less then @xmath70 per nucleon , generically they are known to appear , and they do appear , in string theory when the gut group is broken down to subgrups by modding out freely acting discrete symmetries .",
    "these particles can only be vector - like and must have a huge mass ( planck or string scale ) .",
    "fractional charged particles with masses of the order of the tev scale would be a serious problem , unless they are charged under some additional non - abelian gauge group which confines them .",
    "* models with three families are normally disfavored compared to two or four .",
    "the generic trend is that * * even number of families is always more favorable than an odd , * * these distributions decrease exponentially when the number of families increases .",
    "+ figure [ famplot_standard ] shows the family distribution for the permutation orbifolds of standard gepner models .",
    "all the models ( no exceptional invariants are considered ) have even number of families .",
    "in particular , the number three is missing . in order to improve the abundance of three - family models",
    ", one can consider suitable `` lifts '' .",
    "the lifting procedure is described in @xcite and consists in replacing one of the minimal models , together with the @xmath71 factor , by a different cft with the same modular invariant properties .",
    "this procedure in general raises the weights of the primary fields and produces many spectra with odd number of generations .",
    "+    + figure [ famplot_lift ] shows the family distribution for lifted gepner models .",
    "+    +   + a similar lifting procedure can be carried on with the additional @xmath72 which accompanies the standard model gauge group and is often related to a b - l symmetry @xcite . in this case , two lifts are possible ( lift a and lift b ) .",
    "figures [ famplot_lifta ] and [ famplot_liftb ] refer to such cases . +    +",
