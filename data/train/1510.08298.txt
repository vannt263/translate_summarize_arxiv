    "the general theory of relativity has many sucessful predictions , in particular the existence of the most mysterious structures in the universe : black holes . in this sense",
    "the theoretical area of black hole physics became an attractive and productive line of research in the beginning of the last century .",
    "the knowledge of the behavior of different fields which interact with the gravitational field of black holes , certainly , will give us some relevant informations about the physics of these objects .",
    "in particular , the scalar field constitutes one of these fields which may give us important informations about the physics of a black hole @xcite .    with the aim of constructing a theory combining quantum mechanics and general relativity , the generalization of quantum field theory to curved spacetimes as well as their consequences",
    "have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "in fact , the experimental tests are difficult to make at the level of terrestrial laboratories .",
    "this opens the interest in analogue models that mimic the properties of astrophysics objects . in this sense ,",
    "the field of analogue gravity allows in principle that the most processes of quantum field theory in curved spacetime can be studied in a laboratory .",
    "in particular , the use of supersonic acoustics flows as an analogy to gravitating systems has received a growing attention @xcite .",
    "solutions to the massless klein - gordon equation in the spacetime of both three - dimensional rotating and four - dimensional ( 4d ) canonical acoustic black holes were obtained by vieira and bezerra @xcite and are valid for the whole spacetime . in this context , the general solutions are given in terms of the confluent heun functions and the appropriate forms of the equations suitable to study the hawking radiation were presented and their solutions given .    in this present paper",
    ", we obtain the exact solution of the covariant klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field in the hydrodynamic vortex spacetime , valid in the whole space .",
    "furthermore , this solution is valid for all frequencies of the particles , that is , @xmath0 .",
    "it is given in terms of solutions of the heun equations @xcite .",
    "a property of interest that plays an important role in black hole physics is the quasinormal modes ( see beyer @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many authors have considered the quasispectrum of massive fields in several black hole spacetimes .",
    "the terminology quasinormal modes have been used by simone and will @xcite and fiziev @xcite .",
    "they determine the late - time evolution of fields in the exterior of the black hole .",
    "indeed , this is a boundary value problem for linear ordinary second - order differential equations with singularities at the endpoints of the interval of consideration @xcite .",
    "quasispectrum is not to be confused with quasinormal modes or bound states @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", great attention has been given to the qnms because it is believed that these models shed light on the solution or understanding the fundamental problems in loop quantum gravity @xcite . in this work",
    ", we show that the hydrodynamic vortex , which is an effective spacetime without an event horizon , but with ergoregion , is unstable under linearized perturbations .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce the metric that corresponds to the hydrodynamic vortex , in sec . 3 , we write down the covariant klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field in the background under consideration , in sec .",
    "4 we determine the resonant frequencies , and the large damping limits . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "the acoustic metric appropriate to a draining bathtub model , the so - called rotating acoustic black hole , which is the analog black hole metric ( 2 + 1)-dimensional with lorentzian signature , is given by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the speed of sound and is constant throughout the fluid flow .",
    "when we restricted to @xmath3 , that is , no radial flow and generalised to an anisotropic speed of sound , the metric for a model that describes an acoustic geometry surrounding physical vortices takes the form @xcite @xmath4 being @xmath5 a constant related to the circulation of the fluid .",
    "we can write the metric tensor of the hydrodynamic vortex spacetime as @xmath6 from which we obtain @xmath7 thus , the contravariant components of @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 as the kerr black hole in general relativity , when the @xmath10 vanishes forms the radius of the ergosphere , @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 which coincides with the circle at which the ( absolute value of the ) background flow velocity equals the speed of sound @xmath2 .",
    "note that this spacetime does not have an event horizon .",
    "for a barotropic and inviscid fluid with irrotational flow ( though possibly time dependent ) , the equation of motion for the velocity potential describing a sound wave is identical to that for a minimally coupled massless scalar field , that is , to covariant klein - gordon equation , which has the form @xmath13\\psi=0\\ .",
