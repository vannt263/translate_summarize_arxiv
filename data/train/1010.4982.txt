    "much effort was put into understanding what is going on in doped perovskite manganise oxides both on theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite side .",
    "early expectations that simple physical mechanisms , such as involving for example only jahn - teller ( jt ) interactions and hund s exchange but without coulomb interaction , or pure electronic coulomb interactions while neglecting hund s exchange , could explain the phase diagram and the phase transitions observed situations in the manganites were not confirmed @xcite .",
    "also relatively early it was realized that the core @xmath14 electrons , even if dynamically passive , play an essential role for the stability of magnetic and orbital order @xcite .",
    "altogether , the evidence has accumulated that there is a delicate balance between several competing physical mechanisms which lead to rather complex phase diagram of the perovskite manganites @xcite .",
    "investigation of doped manganites is challenging as the jahn - teller distortions may lead to the charge order which will also favour particular orbital order @xcite . to make the complex situation in doped manganites tractable in the theory , several theoretical papers were focused in past on single - layer and double - layer manganites as the description of quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems was simpler than the one necessary for three - dimensional ( 3d ) doped perovskite manganites",
    "( see for example @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "realistic 3d systems were more difficult to tackle at least on a better basis than simple mean - field type approaches . due to strong local correlations , however , such approaches were not quite appropriate to provide a better insight into the competition between different possible physical mechanisms present in these strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the present paper is one attempt ( among the others ) to fill up this gap .",
    "similar to model studies @xcite , it has been also recognized in the electronic structure calculations performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) that the local interactions are important and one has to use either lda+@xmath15 or lda+dmft @xcite , i.e. , take into account also the dynamical aspects in the dynamical mean field theory .",
    "these calculations confirmed the earlier point of view @xcite that electron - electron interactions and the jahn - teller terms support each other and both are necessary to reproduce the observed orbital order in the undoped compound .",
    "in particular , by the studying the effect of pressure it was concluded that lamno@xmath3 is not a mott - hubbard insulator , but rather a jahn - teller insulator , however , it has been recognized that the correlations play also an important role @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , we introduce ( in ) a _ realistic _ model for @xmath0 electrons in the perovskite manganites which includes the electron coulomb interactions , the coupling between @xmath0 electrons with @xmath16 spins and @xmath14 core @xmath5 spins , superexchange interaction , and the interactions of @xmath0 electrons with local distortions due to the jahn - teller terms ( ) . in this section",
    "we also present the method to determine approximate ground states using a @xmath17 cluster .",
    "we treat electron correlation effects in the ground state beyond the hartree  fock ( hf ) approximation using the so - called local approach ( ) . the numerical results are presented and analysed in . here",
    "we address a question which values of the parameters of the effective hamiltonian are appropriate to account for the experimentally observed situation and present results obtained for the undoped lamno@xmath3 , and for la@xmath1sr@xmath18mno@xmath3 at doping levels @xmath19 , 0.25 and 0.50 . finally , contains a short summary of the paper and general conclusions .",
    "we study strongly correlated electrons in undoped and doped 3d perovskite manganites la@xmath1sr@xmath18mno@xmath3 ( or la@xmath1ca@xmath18mno@xmath3 ) using effective model describing only mn sites renormalised by surrounding oxygens .",
    "at each site we consider wannier orbitals of the @xmath0 character composed out of manganese and oxygen orbitals @xcite .",
    "one of them is filled at mn@xmath20 ions , and both are empty at mn@xmath21 ions in a doped system . in both cases the @xmath14 orbitals on mn ions",
    "are occupied by three `` core '' electrons with total spin @xmath5 ( treated as frozen and classical ) .",
    "thus the active electrons here are only @xmath0 electrons .",
    "we investigate the system by using a model hamiltonian @xmath22 which consists of the kinetic energy , the on - site coulomb interactions , spin interactions , and the jahn - teller term .",
    "this model and/or the essential parts of it , were studied earlier by several groups , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the kinetic part @xmath23 is expressed using a local @xmath0 orbital basis at each site , which reads in short notation , latexmath:[\\[\\label{egbasis }     @xmath0 orbital basis at each site one finds anisotropic phase - dependent hopping @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 are creation operators for an electron in orbital @xmath27 with spin @xmath28 at site @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath29 runs over pairs of nearest neighbours and gives two contributions for each bond @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is interpreted as plus sign for the bond @xmath30 being parallel to the crystal axis @xmath32 and minus for the bond @xmath30 parallel to the axis @xmath33 .",

    "the spin interactions @xmath37 include the leading part of hund s exchange @xmath40 , both between two @xmath0 electrons at the same site , and between @xmath16 spin of a single @xmath0 electron and the @xmath5 core @xmath14 spin at each site . on - site",
    "intraorbital coulomb interaction is denoted as @xmath41 , and the interorbital coulomb interaction is a linear combination of this term and hund s exchange @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "note that we include here only the leading ising part of hund s interaction terms , which is an approximation .",
    "however , within the present method using the correlated wave functions which are obtained by correcting the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , the remaining transverse terms do not contribute , compare refs .",
    "the term @xmath42 is the antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange generated by charge excitations of @xmath14 electrons , which lead to af heisenberg interaction between frozen core @xmath14 electrons @xcite .",
    "this frozen - core approximation for @xmath5 core spins works well for the description of the ground state properties as shown by earlier studies , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .    finally , the jahn - teller @xmath43 part is @xcite : @xmath44 and includes three different jahn - teller modes @xmath45 at each site .",

    ", we decided to keep it to investigate its consequences .",
    "the crystal field splitting between @xmath35 and @xmath56 orbitals was assumed to be zero ( this approximation seems reasonable in quasi - cubic 3d manganites @xcite though some authors @xcite assume instead small finite values ) . below we describe the numerical simulatons performed on finite 3d clusters with the above model the variants of the described model reproduced the observed sequence of magnetic phases for increasing hole doping in 2d monolayer and bilayer manganites @xcite .",
    "we studied @xmath57 clusters with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) filled be different number of @xmath0 electrons , corresponding to the undoped lamno@xmath3 system , and to systems with doping one - eight ( @xmath19 ) , quarter - doped system ( @xmath58 ) and half - doped system ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "all calculations were performed at zero temperature ( @xmath60 k ) .",
    "first , the calculations within the single - determinant hf approximation were performed to determine the ground state wave function @xmath61 .",
    "also the energetic distance @xmath62 between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) ( homo - lumo gap ) was extracted at this step .    in the next step each",
    "hf wave functions was independently modified to improve the energy and to include the electron correlations using the so - called local ansatz ( for details see refs .",
    "we used the ansatz for the correlated ground state , @xmath63 where @xmath64 are variational parameters , and @xmath65 is a set of local correlation operators .",
    "these operators include the leading local density - density correlations in the present model for the perovskite manganites , in analogy to the 2d layered manganites , see refs .",
    "these local operators used in the present model correspond to the subselection of the most important two electron excitations within the _ ab initio _ configuration  interaction method .",
    "the variational parameters @xmath64 were found by minimising the total energy @xmath66 in this way the correlation energy , @xmath67 was obtained .",
    "coming to technical details , in the first step hf computations were performed for each considered electron filling , starting from one of several different initial conditions ( about a thousand for each set of hamiltonian parameters ) , i.e. , from predefined ( some symmetric but mostly random ) charge distribution , spin configuration , the latter selected from eight predefined patterns of core @xmath14 spins ( see figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and from several predefined sets of classical variables @xmath45 . for each fixed set of the starting parameters and starting initial conditions on convergence we obtained a hf wave function which was a candidate for the ground state wave function .",
    "this self - consistent procedure was performed to provide energy minimum also with respect to the @xmath45 classical variables @xcite .    after completing the hf computations we performed correlation computations ( as a second step for each investigated wave function ) obtaining the total energy and",
    "the correlation energy ( for more details see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . after obtaining the total energy for one configuration",
    ", we repeated the entire procedure from the beginning , i.e. , we took another ( second ) set of hf initial conditions and repeat all computations to obtain the second candidate for the ground state . similarly for the third , fourth , @xmath68 , _ etcetera _ , set of initial conditions .",
    "finally , the resulting set of total energies was inspected and the lowest one was identified as a good candidate for the true ground state .",
    "as the parameters of the model are known only with certain accuracy , the computations were repeated for many sets of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "the values of the parameters which one should consider as realistic for la@xmath1(sr , ca)@xmath18mno@xmath3 were extensively discussed in the literature ( for a review in context of the present paper see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . following the standard parameter sets @xcite",

    "actually almost all values of @xmath76 either yield conducting state for both @xmath19 and @xmath58 doping levels , or they yield an insulator , also for both above doping levels .",

    "this phase is almost generic and can be reproduced on the phase diagram for many sets of hamiltonian parameters .",

    "it is known that at pressure of 32 gpa lamno@xmath3 becomes conducting @xcite . in order to investigate the effect of pressure we followed heuristic argumentation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite  it has been argued there ( see figure 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the effect of 32 gpa pressure can be reproduced in a model similar to our effective model when @xmath71 and @xmath73 hamiltonian parameters are renormalised in the following way : @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the other parameters ( of the model ) were left unchanged .",
    "we note that this assumption is somewhat unrealistic as at least the superexchange @xmath100 would also increase under pressure , but this effect is not important as long as we investigate the ground state and the magnetic structure does not change . @xmath41 and other effective parameters of the hamiltonian should also show some limited variation under increasing pressure .    inserting the new renormalised values of hopping and jahn - teller constant into our computations we found that the high pressure phase is indeed a conductor and we could identify the conducting phase as perfect charge - homogeneous , fm phase with zero jahn - teller distortions and with perfect half - to - half @xmath101 and @xmath102 orbital order on each individual site .",

    "this phase is characterized by a rather interesting charge and orbital distribution , with a distinct alternation in charge density between even and odd planes .",
    "consequently , this phase is an insulator , in agreement with the experiment @xcite , though a weak one as indicated by rather small homo - lumo gap shown in figure 4 ( curve in the middle , squares ) .",

    "first , in even numbered planes there are somewhat less electrons and the orbitals are of @xmath101 character , @xmath116 and @xmath84 take the value of @xmath117  .",
    "these distortions favor the @xmath56 orbitals . however , there are also some exceptions , i.e. , occasionally on a site we find the @xmath102 orbital occupied and @xmath118  .",
    "the charges are distributed in a slightly non - homogeneous way , with the site to site variations of charge being at most 0.2 @xmath119 .",
    "second , in the odd numbered planes one finds a little bigger average charge density per site than in the even planes and almost homogeneous charge distribution .",
    "in contrast to the even planes , one finds predominantly @xmath102 orbitals occupied . the jahn - teller distortions are @xmath120  and @xmath121  .",
    "again , we have seen also some exceptions , with @xmath56 orbitals occupied at a few sites and the corresponding modified jahn - teller distortions , similar to those in the even planes .",
    "in fact , this result shows that sites with differently occupied orbitals can proliferate between the even and odd planes and form charge and orbital defects in each plane .",

    ", width=302 ]    also for quarter - doped manganites , such as la@xmath122sr@xmath123mno@xmath3 , one finds fm order and weakly non - homogeneous charge distribution with the present parameters ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "these results are similar to the ground state found for @xmath19  we have found again nonequivalent alternating planes , as described below .",
    "the correlations do not change this result , and are again weak ( table 1 ) as the local moments have formed and the main effects are already captured in the hf approach .    on the one hand , within even numbered planes in the ground state one",
    "has weak charge order in form of a stripe phase , with vertical or horizontal charge - minority lines alternating with charge - majority lines ( charge difference of about @xmath125 ) .",
    "charge minority sites have mixed half to half @xmath56 and @xmath35 orbital occupancy and negligible jahn - teller distortions , which is characteristic for the orbital liquid in the metallic state @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite different along the charge majority lines  one finds there half of these sites with @xmath56 orbitals and with negligible @xmath126 distortions , and with @xmath127  .",
    "the other half of these sites carries the mixture of @xmath35 and @xmath56 roughly in proportion 2:1 and negligible @xmath128 distortions , whereas @xmath129  . these sites with higher electron density ( i.e. , those with @xmath56 orbitals and those with 2:1 orbitals @xmath35 and @xmath56 ) alternate along the charge - majority lines .",
    "on the other hand , on odd numbered planes the orbitals and jahn - teller distortions are much the same as the ones on even numbered planes ( as described above ) .",
    "however there is a difference  along charge - minority lines ( each second line in the cluster ) we did not find homogeneous charge density but , instead alternating charge - minority and charge - majority sites .",
    "the fm phase at @xmath58 doping should be a metal which follows from quite small homo - lumo gap ( @xmath109 ev ) , see figure 4 .",

    "a somewhat unprecise but still common point of view is that a manganite doped with strontium is more metallic than the manganite doped with calcium ( more insulating ) which in turn might be attributed to weaker coupling to the lattice by the jahn - teller interactions in strontium compounds and a bigger role of these interactions in calcium compounds .",
    "indeed , the fm phase was found insulating in a broader range of doping in la@xmath1ca@xmath18mno@xmath3 than in la@xmath1sr@xmath18mno@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if this is the case then our effective model should provide a different prediction for the ground state when @xmath76 is larger .    when we discussed the precise values of hamiltonian parameters following the discussion presented in ref .",

    "now the spin order in the ground state is indeed in form of fm zig - zags with af order between them , characteristic for the ce phase , and the charge order is of checkerboard type ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the ce phase is quite robust , it is identified at the hf level and the correlations when added do not change this result .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens in bilayer half - doped manganites where the correlations stabilize the ce phase @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the magnetic moments are larger in the 3d system , and therefore the role of electron correlations in the magnetic states such as the ce phase is reduced .      the results presented up to now indicate the importance of jahn - teller interactions . due to",
    "them local distortions are created at each doping level , and they influence both the electronic structure and the magnetic properties .",
    "it seems that the value of @xmath76 coupling is the primary factor which determines whether the 3d perovskite system is a conductor or an insulator .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable to perform additional test computations switching off the jahn - teller interactions .",
    "we performed such computation for la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the resulting ground states were all the same : fm , charge homogeneous orbital liquid phase @xcite , with half to half ratio of @xmath56 to @xmath35 orbitals at each site and conducting ( homo - lumo gaps we found were all about 0.1 ev ) .",
    "this confirms the above point of view that the jahn - teller distortions play a crucial role for the charge , magnetic and orbital order in doped perovskite manganites .",
    "we considered the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 electrons which takes into account their kinetic energy with anisotropic phase dependent hopping @xmath137 , on - site coulomb interaction @xmath15 , hund s exchange coupling @xmath40 , their coupling to frozen core @xmath14 electrons @xmath138 , the heisenberg af superexchange @xmath42 between core @xmath132 spins , and the jahn - teller interactions with lattice distortions . due to the complexity of the problem",
    ", we could not provide a precise proof that this model is sufficient for the physical properties of the perovskite manganites , but rather we report on results of computations which demonstrate that all these interactions enter on equal footing and seem to be essential for correct interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "indeed , we have performed also calculations with several sets ignoring one or the other interaction term , and the results were very unsatisfactory in all cases , i.e. , such simplified models were not able to reproduce the experimental observations .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the realistic jahn - teller coupling plays a rather special and a very important role in the manganites as it controls the conductivity of the perovskite 3d systems .",
    "we have presented evidence that this interaction generates local distortions in the entire investigated range of hole doping @xmath139 which lead to charge inhomogeneities , defects in the orbital occupancy , and influences the magnetic order .",
    "such states have been seen before in the experimental data on doped manganites @xcite and were also suggested to follow from the theoretical models @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , reliable studies of systems with charge disorder and local distortions are very difficult to perform , but the present results demonstrate that these states might decide about the colossal magnetoresistance and select one or the other type of magnetic order . particularly at half - doping ( @xmath59 ) we have found a subtle balance between the fm phase and the ce phase , the latter stabilized by large jahn - teller interactions .",
    "this is not surprising as the nearest neighbor jt coupling might not be sufficient to stabilize the observed zigzag fm chains in the ce phase for the realistic parameters .",
    "the mechanism invoked in @xcite to stabilize the ce phase is subtle and employes the cooperative jt interaction between next - nearest mn@xmath20 neighbors mediated by the breathing mode distortion of mn@xmath21 octahedra and displacements of mn@xmath21 ions .    as found before for monolayer and bilayer doped manganites , see refs .",
    "@xcite , we have obtained many metastable ground states in the 3d system which are possible in principle .",
    "such states are not discussed in detail in the present paper , but we just point out that they represent local energy minima and could be also realized at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , the search for the best candidate for the true ground state requires examination of numerous phases with different kinds of nonhomogeneous charge distribution .",
    "therefore , we suggest as a general conclusion that nonhomogeneous charge distribution is a generic feature of the doped perovskite manganites .",
    "it follows that the theoretical predictions which are based on models assuming just a few _ a priori _ selected candidates for the ground state ( especially the ones with high symmetry of charge or orbital order ) can not be fully conclusive unless they are based on reliable experimental data .",
