    "it is evident that there is optical obscuration in spiral galaxies yet the quantitative amount of the dimming due to obscuration is disputed .",
    "there is a displacement in the photometric properties of edge - on and face - on galaxies . if distance considerations are taken into account , then in a set of similarly sized galaxies the more edge - on ones will tend to be fainter , or in a set of galaxies of the same luminosity the",
    "more edge - on ones will tend to be bigger .",
    "this opening statement touches on the two outstanding problems that confront efforts to quantify the level of obscuration in galaxies . to begin with , there is more than one good explanation for the photometric separation of galaxies with inclination : galaxies of the same intrinsic size and luminosity might appear dimmer toward edge - on because of increased path lengths through the obscuring material , or they might appear larger toward edge - on because surface brightnesses are enhanced by the increased path lengths .",
    "the second big problem arises out of uncertain relative distances with most samples since luminosities and dimensions scale differently with distance , hence distance uncertainties add noise to tests .",
    "a nice review of previous research is provided by huizinga ( 1994 ) . at one extreme",
    ", galaxies were accepted to be completely transparent and corrections were made only to dimensions in the _ reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1964 ) . at the other extreme , galaxies were proposed to be optically thick at all observable radii by valentijn ( 1990 ) , to the extent that gonzlez - serrano & valentijn ( 1991 ) posited the obscuring material could resolve the ` dark matter ' problem .",
    "the current generally accepted viewpoint is intermediate .",
    "spiral galaxies probably have high opacities near their centers but are relatively transparent at their visible extremities .",
    "we have a utilitarian need to understand the global obscuration properties of spiral galaxies .",
    "a primary consideration for us is the need to correct for inclination effects with luminosity  hi profile linewidth distance estimators ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "inclination dependencies also have to be understood when we use photometric information in statistical studies of galactic structure ( cf , tully & verheijen 1997 ) . in these cases",
    ", it may be enough to know the overall and statistical effects of projection from an empirical evaluation .",
    "an alternative approach is to try to develop a physical model of what is happening .",
    "however , a realistic model would have a lot of parameters and require a lot of information as constraints .",
    "there have been attempts in this direction ( wainscoat , freeman , & hyland 1989 ; byun , freeman , & kylafis 1994 ; bianchi , ferrara , & giovanardi 1996 ) . to date",
    ", there has not been any study with both the information content per object needed for elaborate modeling and the large number of objects needed for a statistical evaluation of the norm and range of obscuration properties .",
    "what we bring that is new is imaging photometry over a substantial optical  infrared baseline : large format @xmath0 ccd imaging and  imaging with a 256x256 hgcdte detector . our sample is not really large but it has nice qualities with respect to the distance problem and with respect to completion .",
    "we are using data from two clusters , hence objects are at either of two discrete distances , and there is a measure of completion to well specified limits .    our primary sample is drawn from the ursa major cluster .",
    "the photometric data has been published by tully et al .",
    "there are 62 galaxies in a window on the sky and in redshift that are brighter than @xmath9 at @xmath2 .",
    "optical photometry is available for all 62 and  photometry is available for 60 .",
    "observations and reductions of the optical components were done by mjp , mawv , and rbt .",
    "observations and reductions of the  material were carried out by jsh , mawv , and rbt .",
    "the ursa major cluster is a loose , irregular cluster with normal spirals and few gas - poor systems .",
    "it is probably dynamically young",
    ". the constituents may be representative of typical galaxies outside of dense regions .",
    "our sample is complete down to roughly the luminosity of the small magellanic cloud at @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , there is a paucity of extremely luminous galaxies in this sample .",
    "our supplemental sample is drawn from what has been called the pisces cluster , part of the perseus - pisces filament ( haynes & giovanelli 1988 ) , and an entity that has frequently been used in studies of distances and flows ( aaronson et al .",
    "1986 ; han & mould 1992 ) .",
    "sakai , giovanelli , & wegner ( 1994 ) have discussed an overlapping part of the region and refer to subunits as the ngc  383 and ngc  507 groups .",
    "we consider candidates within the window @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "there are a couple of knots in the region dominated by early - type galaxies but spirals are scattered about in an irregular fashion .",
    "we take galaxies detected in the hi 21 cm line at arecibo ( giovanelli & haynes 1985 , 1989 , wegner , haynes , & giovanelli 1993 ) , typed as spirals , and with cataloged axial ratios @xmath14 .",
    "the arecibo telescope gives a high detection rate for spirals at 5,000   so there is reasonable completion ( at @xmath15 ) to a magnitude limit of @xmath16 .",
    "this limit is @xmath17 after corrections , roughly the magnitude of the local group galaxy m33 .",
    "cases where the hi signals may be confused are avoided .",
    "this pisces sample has the disadvantages that our axial ratio limit excludes very face - on examples and for observational reasons it is not as rigorously complete as the ursa major sample ( details in next section ) .",
    "however , it contains a substantial number of intrinsically luminous spirals .",
    "the optical photometry was acquired and reduced by mjp and rbt .",
    "photometry was obtained by plw , ws , and rbt .",
    "there are 38 galaxies in the pisces sample .",
    "the information we have available allows us to excape the problems that have plagued efforts to calibrate the levels of obscuration in galaxies .",
    "we will describe tests that decouple luminosities and dimensions .",
    "the cluster nature of the samples essentially eliminates scatter due to uncertain relative distances .",
    "the sample completeness features are important .",
    "two different tests have been considered .",
    "it turns out that the most sensitive test involves deviations as a function of inclination from the mean correlation in color - magnitude plots where one passband is @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath5 and the other passband is . another test gives consistent but less statistically significant results .",
    "it involves deviations with inclination from the mean correlations between luminosities and hi profile linewidths .",
    "the latter test requires kinematic information as well as photometric and can not include very face - on cases because of the large uncertainties in the deprojected kinematic parameter .",
    "hence , fewer galaxies are available for the second test and the inclination baseline is truncated .",
    "also , the ratio of reddening scatter to the intrinsic luminosity scatter in the relations is somewhat more favorable in the first test compared with the second .    between the two clusters , we have 101 galaxies with @xmath18 information in our magnitude limited sample .",
    "it will be seen that the statistical effects of obscuration are quite evident .",
    "the question becomes , how complex a description of the obscuration does the data afford ?",
    "the simplest case would be the definition of a single coefficient for some analytic dependency on inclination or ellipticity in each bandpass .",
    "however , it has been suggested that there are dependencies on such additional parameters as type ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ; han 1992 ) or luminosity ( giovanelli et al . 1995 ) . indeed",
    ", it will be shown that there is a strong dependence of obscuration on luminosity in our sample .",
    "as giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) point out , the correction procedure that is adopted affects the slope of the luminosity  linewidth correlation hence , potentially , distance estimates based on that correlation .",
    "the challenge to us is to generate a description of the luminosity dependence with our relatively limited sample .",
    "one needs enough cases in a bin to sample a broad inclination range and characterize the scatter .",
    "then the luminosity dependence has to be transformed to a distance - independent parameter , like the profile width , to be useful for distance measurements",
    ".    it would also be nice to further our understanding of how the obscuring material is distributed in galaxies .",
    "for example , giovanelli et al . ( 1994 ) and peletier et al . (",
    "1995 ) contend that there is a strong radial dependence , with considerable obscuration near the centers of galaxies and little at the outer edges",
    ". it would be possible to investigate that kind of effect with two - dimensional color decompositions with our data .",
    "however , that study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the ursa major data set is the larger of the two cluster samples and has more rigorous completion limits .",
    "the cluster membership was defined by windows on the plane of the sky and in velocity , as discussed by tully et al .",
    "the photometric data are provided in that paper for the 79 galaxies accepted as cluster members .",
    "the census of the cluster within the proscribed window constraints is considered to be complete to @xmath19 , or after preliminary corrections for inclination and assuming a distance modulus of @xmath20 ( 18.5  mpc ) , m@xmath21 at the faint limit .",
    "some photometric , kinematic , and dynamical properties of these galaxies were discussed by tully & verheijen ( 1997 ) and verheijen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the distance to uma was determined by the luminosity  linewidth methodology ( pierce & tully , 1988 , 1992 ; tully 1997 ) . for intercomparisons within the uma sample ,",
    "the distance choice is irrelevant ; the only issue is the validity of the assumption that all the distances are the same",
    ". the intercomparisons _ between _ the uma and pisces samples requires knowledge of the _ relative _ distances of the two groups but the zero - point calibration of the distance estimator is irrelevant .",
    "moreover , it will be shown that our primary color ",
    "magnitude test is quite _ insensitive to modest relative distance errors_. hence , the data are transformed to absolute magnitudes to facilitate the intercomparison between clusters but the results are insensitive to uncertainties in distances .",
    "all our color  magnitude comparisons are made with ",
    "magnitudes and colors that stretch to  from one of @xmath22 , or @xmath5 . this choice is made because  is almost free of reddening hence , overwhelmingly , the obscuration effects are found in the color term only .",
    "the @xmath2-band completion limit is found to translate to a ",
    "limit of m@xmath23 for the uma cluster .",
    "the superscripts indicate that corrections have been made for reddening within our own galaxy ( latitude @xmath24 ) and for the redshift spectral displacement ( @xmath25-correction ) , although both are negligible for the uma systems .",
    "these corrections are small but not completely negligible for the pisces systems to be discussed next .",
    "the galactic reddening corrections are taken from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) in the following ratios between bands : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the spectral displacement adjustments ( @xmath30corrections ) are @xmath31 for uma galaxies and for pisces galaxies are @xmath32 at @xmath2 ( pence 1976 ) and @xmath33 at @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and . the bands are johnson @xmath2 , cousins @xmath34 , and a filtering of the @xmath35 infrared atmospheric window that damps thermal noise .",
    "after tiny galactic and @xmath30corrections ( but _ not _ inclination corrections ) have been applied , there are 63 galaxies in the magnitude limited sample ( complete except for 2 galaxies missing  photometry : the s@xmath36 galaxy ugc  6628 and the s@xmath37 galaxy ugc  7129 ) .",
    "ten of these are classified s0 or s0/@xmath37 .",
    "our tests fail to demonstrate that there is any extinction in this small sub - set of early - type galaxies .",
    "hence these galaxies earlier than s@xmath37 are excluded from further consideration .",
    "the magnitude limit excludes any galaxy of type i@xmath36 .",
    "the uma sample thus provides our analysis with 53 spirals typed s@xmath37 to s@xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , the uma cluster lacks extremely luminous members .",
    "the brightest galaxy at  is ngc  3953 , an s@xmath38 system with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and a maximum rotation velocity @xmath41  ( these values have been corrected for inclination effects in ways to be described ) .",
    "this system is comparable to our galaxy and considerably smaller than andromeda . if extinction is a function of luminosity ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 ) then the sample needs to be extended to larger systems .",
    "the pisces region sample suits our needs .",
    "the pisces cluster galaxies selected for this study lie within the space and velocity windows described in the previous section , have cataloged axial ratios @xmath42 ( nominally , inclinations greater than @xmath43 ) , are classed as spirals , and have been detected in the hi radio line .",
    "giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) claim ` reasonable completion for spirals larger than @xmath44 ' as reported in the _ uppsala general catalogue _ ( nelson 1973 ) and ` more than 90% ' completion of spirals brighter than @xmath45 in the _ catalogue of galaxies and clusters of galaxies _ ( zwicky et al .",
    "1961 - 68 ) .",
    "the pisces sample is taken to be at a distance of 60  mpc , @xmath46 , @xmath47 more distant than uma .",
    "this distance is determined from a recalibration of the luminosity  linewidth relations ( tully 1997 ) reviewed in section  6 .",
    "the _ differential _ uma  pisces distance comes from the superposition of the data from these two regions .",
    "it will be explained further along why our primary test is not very sensitive to relative distance uncertainties . at this assumed distance ,",
    "the equivalent -band completion limit for our sample is @xmath48 ( galactic- and @xmath30corrections applied but not inclination corrections ) .",
    "we have 4-band photometry for 34 galaxies brighter than the completion limit .",
    "the most luminous galaxy in this pisces sample has @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and a maximum rotation velocity @xmath51  , properties resembling the andromeda galaxy .    in summary",
    ", our analysis will be conducted with 87 galaxies ; 53 spirals in uma with @xmath52@xmath53 and 34 spirals in pisces with @xmath54@xmath55 .",
    "the uma systems cover a full range of inclinations but systems toward face - on were not observed in pisces .",
    "color  magnitude diagrams are shown in figure  1 for @xmath56 vs. , @xmath57 vs. , and @xmath58 vs. .",
    "the different symbols distinguish the uma and pisces samples .",
    "galactic- and @xmath30corrections have been applied but _ not _",
    "corrections for obscuration as a function of inclination .",
    "the lines in fig",
    ".  1 are regressions with uncertainties in colors .",
    "obscuration as a function of tilt essentially only affects the colors .",
    "our expectation is that more edge - on systems would be reddened by extinction and tend to lie to the right in the color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "in fact , this expectation is met for the high luminosity cases but is not clearly met for the faintest galaxies . galaxies with @xmath59 have considerable extinction , and galaxies with @xmath60 have negligible extinction . the evidence is shown in figure  2 .",
    "after some experimentation , it was decided the best we could do with the present information is to separate the data into four luminosity zones .",
    "deviations from the mean @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 vs.  fits are plotted as a function of axial ratio in the four separate bins .",
    "we adopt a standard empirical description of the extinction , @xmath61 , as a function of inclination , @xmath62 , in the passband , @xmath63 : @xmath64 the nomenclature in the superscript , @xmath65 , implies corrections are to face - on orientation but do not account for extinction in a face - on system .",
    "inclinations are related to axial ratios , @xmath66 , through : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the axial ratio of a system viewed edge - on . for the purposes of this discussion we take @xmath69 , although values as low as @xmath70 can be entertained and the choice is not important here .",
    "our corrections , @xmath71 , do not depend on the choice of @xmath68 , only on @xmath66 .",
    "optimal values of @xmath72 were found for each of the four luminosity bins and the three passbands @xmath73 .",
    "the optimal values satisfy the requirement that , with these corrections to magnitudes , there are then no color  magnitude residuals with axial ratio .",
    "the uncertainties that are recorded correspond to corrections that give slopes which differ by one standard deviation from no correlation .",
    "account has to be taken that extinction is not entirely negligible at . in this analysis , we assume @xmath74 is 15% of @xmath75 , 21% of @xmath76 , and 25% of @xmath77 .",
    "these choices might sound surprisingly high .",
    "they were arrived at iteratively and will be justified in section  5 .",
    "the best fits are shown in fig .",
    "as expected , the amplitude of extinction drops from @xmath2 , through @xmath3 , to @xmath5 .",
    "it is evident that the amplitude of extinction within any of these bands also drops in passing from high to low luminosity . by the lowest luminosity bin",
    "the correlation with axial ratio is so weak that it is not statistically significant .",
    "the information in the three passbands is not entirely independent since the samples are the same and all colors share the same ",
    "these results are summarized by the placement of the filled squares in figure  3 .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed with the residuals of linewidth  magnitude correlations .",
    "this test is not quite as sensitive as the one already described , for the reasons mentioned in the introduction . since fewer galaxies are available , we consider three bins instead of four : @xmath78 ( 21 galaxies ) , @xmath79 ( 25 galaxies ) , and @xmath80 ( 16 galaxies ) . the results from these tests are recorded by the filled triangles in fig .  3 .",
    "the evidence from the two tests are consistent and clearly indicate a falling trend of @xmath72 toward the fainter galaxies .",
    "before we draw conclusions , though , let us compare these results with what others have found .",
    "most of the early work involving large data sets use @xmath2 material , or photographic magnitudes transformed to @xmath2 . in the _ third reference catalogue _ ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) extinction is described by the familiar parameterization @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is described as type dependent .",
    "it is a maximum value for type s@xmath83 at @xmath84 and decreases symmetrically with type steps toward earlier or later morphologies to @xmath85 at types s@xmath37 and s@xmath36 .",
    "there is a strong correlation between type and luminosity , especially for s@xmath38 and later ( later types tend to be fainter ) so it can be expected that the alternative dependencies of extinction on type or luminosity are manifestations of the same phenomenon .",
    "the _ third reference catalogue _ description is in the mid - to - upper range of the effect we see .",
    "it is possible that high luminosity early - type spirals have less obscuration than late types of the same luminosity , as the _ third reference catalogue _ corrections would suggest .",
    "the statistics with our sample are too slim to test this possibility with only @xmath86 of our spirals typed s@xmath87 . from our limited information , we concur with the _ third reference catalogue _ that extinction appears to be negligible in s0 systems .",
    "bottinelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find a slightly larger @xmath88 for pure disk systems , galaxies that would be typed s@xmath89 .",
    "these corrections are substantial and correspond to relatively opaque systems .",
    "bottinelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) argue that @xmath90 as far out in the galaxies as radii corresponding to a @xmath2 surface brightness of 25 mag arcsec@xmath91 . as a consequence ,",
    "they argue , diameters at that isophote are insensitive to inclination .",
    "our results seem to be in reasonable agreement with both bottinelli et al . and",
    "the _ third reference catalogue _ although the details are difficult to compare because we formulate the dependencies differently .",
    "we would need a bigger sample to look for type variations .",
    "considerable recent work has been done at @xmath5 band .",
    "han ( 1992 ) used the parameterization @xmath92 with @xmath93 for types s@xmath38-s@xmath83 and the lesser values of @xmath94 for types s@xmath95-s@xmath24 and @xmath96 for types s@xmath97 and later .",
    "these results are in the upper half of our range and are a plausible translation of our luminosity effect to a type effect .",
    "giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , in a first paper on extinction , used the same analytic form and found @xmath98 , near the top end of our range . in passing , we mention a correction with a different formulation , @xmath99 , given by bernstein et al .",
    "this formulation gives much larger adjustments over the full range of inclinations from edge - on to face - on , and is somewhat larger even from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , the range over which it was defined .",
    "the bernstein et al .",
    "algorithm gives a poor fit toward face - on , but otherwise all the descriptions compared here give consistent results within reasonable uncertainties .    in a follow - up paper , giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) gave attention to luminosity dependencies and it is this work that provides the best possibility of a close comparison with the current results .",
    "data plotted in fig .",
    "7 of giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are replotted as circles in the @xmath5 panel of fig .  3 here , with an @xmath102 increase in the absolute magnitude scale to shift the distance scale from h@xmath103  mpc@xmath104 to h@xmath105 , so as to be consistent with our pisces distance .",
    "the circles are filled or open as in the giovanelli et al . figure .",
    "the error bars have not been carried over but they are comparable to those associated with the filled squares .",
    "the trends in the two data sets are similar , though giovanelli et al .",
    "find somewhat larger extinction at a given luminosity than is found in the present analysis .",
    "the offset is too large to be attributed to magnitude differences due to a zero - point difference in distances .",
    "perhaps the greater extinction found by giovanelli et al . is a manifestation of a type dependence separate from the luminosity dependence .",
    "the giovanelli et al .",
    "sample is dominantly composed of late spirals which are the types suspected to have the highest extinction .",
    "our ` complete ' spiral sample is diluted by earlier types which plausibly have less extinction at a given luminosity .    the solid straight line in fig .",
    "3 is a least - squares fit to our data with weights dependent on the inverse - square of the errors .",
    "the dashed line is a similar fit to the giovanelli et al .",
    "the two fits are formally inconsistent .",
    "the dotted line bisects the two fits and is equivalent to a fit that gives equal weight to each of the two data sets .",
    "this line is marginally consistent as a fit to each data set .",
    "we have no basis for a preference of one result over the other . the data providing the open circles from giovanelli et al .",
    "are less trustworthy because they are derived from a test that required corrections to dimensions as well as magnitudes .",
    "the filled circles result from the same test that gives our filled triangles .",
    "our test based on the color ",
    "magnitude correlation , that gives our filled boxes , is intrinsically a more sensitive test .",
    "however giovanelli et al .",
    "draw on a much larger sample of 2816 galaxies .",
    "hence they have been able to use 10 bins instead of our 3 or 4 .",
    "we have a better test , use galaxies of all inclination , and have a complete sample to absolute magnitude limits but giovanelli et al .",
    "have a lot more galaxies .",
    "hence , we propose to use the description that bisects our two results . with more data , it might ultimately prove possible to provide a more refined description of the luminosity dependence of extinction , with type , perhaps , as a second parameter .",
    "this conclusion with the @xmath5 band results raises the quandry that if we advocate greater extinction than our @xmath5 material suggests then what should we suppose is going on at @xmath2 and @xmath3 ?",
    "tentatively , we suppose that if giovanelli et al .",
    "had @xmath2 and @xmath3 data for their large sample then they would have found greater extinction than we find .",
    "the dotted lines in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 panels assume augmentations above the solid lines such that at the luminosity of the brightest galaxy in our sample @xmath72 is enhanced by 2% over what we find and such that @xmath72 goes to zero @xmath106 fainter than found with our data .",
    "these conditions are roughly consistent with what is found at @xmath107 .",
    "our comparisons would not be complete without mention that willick et al .",
    "( 1996 ) explicitely discount a luminosity dependence for extinction corrections .",
    "they base their claim on an analysis of the mathewson , ford , & buchhorn ( 1992 ) data set at @xmath5 and also their own material at @xmath108 ( for which courteau ( 1996 ) finds @xmath109 ) .",
    "their analysis is more indirect , asking if there are residuals in distance estimates as a combined function of inclination and luminosity .",
    "they find no such correlation in residuals but the plots have a lot of scatter . our tests and those by giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are more direct and less buried in other components of scatter .",
    "the extinction in the faintest galaxies in our sample is so low that it is not significantly above our measurement capability though other authors find evidence for absorption at low luminosities or late types .",
    "our complete sample in uma extends roughly as faint as the small magellanic cloud .",
    "the other data sets that have been discussed draw from galaxies at larger redshift and contain relatively few galaxies as faint .",
    "the status of extinction in low luminosity galaxies is not yet on a good footing .",
    "the equations that describe the short - dashed lines in fig .  3 and , hence ,",
    "represent the corrections we advocate are ( with @xmath110 ) : @xmath111    or @xmath112 if @xmath113 ,    @xmath114    or @xmath115 if @xmath116 ,    @xmath117    or @xmath118 if @xmath119 ,    @xmath120    or @xmath121 if @xmath122 .",
    "the adjustments specified by the absorption model that have been discussed have been applied to the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams that are shown in figure  4 . the luminosity amplitude dependency illustrated by the short - dashed lines in fig .  3 is applied .",
    "hence the faintest galaxies have little correction . because of this luminosity dependence to the corrections , the color  magnitude correlations become very steep . as a consequence ,",
    "these relationships are not useful as distance estimators , contrary to the hopes of tully , mould , & aaronson ( 1982 ) .",
    "however the weak dependence of the color - magnitude relations on distances means that relative uncertainties in the distances of uma and pisces are not important for the present analysis .",
    "the rms scatter about the regression ( errors in color ) are @xmath123 in @xmath56 , @xmath124 in @xmath57 , and @xmath125 in @xmath58. the scatter is greatest at the faint luminosities .",
    "the 10 galaxies typed earlier than s@xmath37 are located in fig .  4 with special star symbols .",
    "these galaxies have not received corrections for obscuration .",
    "they are redder than the mean of the spirals , lying at the boundary of the scatter displayed by the spirals .",
    "eq .  ( 3)-(5 ) imply @xmath126 and @xmath127 which are larger values than anticipated if the galactic reddening law along a fixed path were applicable . the relative galactic fixed path reddening values are 0.62 and 0.41 , respectively ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ; but for @xmath34 filters in the cousins , not johnson , system  our filter central wavelengths are 6470  and 8320 , respectively ) .",
    "han ( 1992 ) has correctly pointed out that the reddening should not fall as quickly toward the infrared as would be anticipated from the galactic reddening law because path lengths are not the same at all wavelengths in the present situation .",
    "the galactic law pertains to the obscuration between the observer and a fixed source . in the present situation ,",
    "the observer is looking to different distances at different wavelengths along those lines - of - sight that become optically thick .",
    "the observer will look deeper into nebulosities at @xmath5 than at @xmath2 but many sight - lines will still be terminated by large optical depths .    by extension it can be expected that obscuration at ",
    "is not entirely negligible although it is too little to be measured directly by the tests at our disposition . from the galactic law one",
    "anticipates @xmath128 .",
    "however the han effect must be at play and from the enhancement of @xmath129 above the galactic law value it can be concluded that @xmath130 . for our purposes , we will tentatively accept @xmath131 .",
    "corrections at   can reach @xmath132 for the most luminous , highly inclined galaxies .",
    "the formulation of extinction corrections in terms of luminosities is of limited utility for our primary interest , which is the use of luminosity  linewidth correlations as distance estimators .",
    "absolute luminosities are to be an output of the process so they can not also be an input . however , the correction can work if it is based on the value of the distance independent variable . for our interests ,",
    "the distance independent variable is the hi profile linewidths or some other measure of the rotation rate .",
    "a similar motivation pushed giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to express absorption corrections in terms of their version of the rotation parameter .",
    "extinction corrected luminosity  linewidth correlations are seen in figure  5 .",
    "the straight lines illustrate linear regressions with uncertainties in linewidths .",
    "these fits are described by the following equations , where the linewidth parameter , @xmath133 , was discussed by tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) : @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137    as an aside , it can be noted that the luminosity  dependent extinction corrections cause the bluer bands to be steeper than they appear in the absence of such a dependency in the corrections .",
    "hence , there is a much weaker color term in the slope than has been found in the past .",
    "also , the differential correction with luminosity acts to eliminate curvature in the logarithmic luminosity  linewidth correlations .    the relations between @xmath72 and @xmath138 presented in eq .",
    "( 3)-(6 ) can now be recast to replace @xmath138 terms with @xmath139 terms .",
    "the extinction parameter @xmath72 can go to zero but can not go negative .",
    "@xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 fortunately , absorption values @xmath144 are stabilized against inclination uncertainties because an error drives the @xmath72 and @xmath145 terms in offsetting senses .    the properties of the luminosity  linewidth correlations and the measurement of distances are not our direct concern in this paper , but the fits in fig .  5",
    "do strongly constrain the relative distances of the ursa major and pisces clusters . the best distance",
    "is given by minimizing the residuals of each cluster separately to the mean line and taking the average of the four passbands .",
    "@xmath2 is given a relative weight of 0.7 , in proportion to the square of the increased dispersion in that band .",
    "the relative distance modulus difference ( pisces  uma ) is @xmath146 .",
    "the relative moduli in the different bands agree with that value with @xmath147 rms dispersion .",
    "the rms scatter about the mean relationships is @xmath148 at @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and  , and @xmath149 at @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath150 in the distance estimate is the quadrature sum of the separate standard deviations of the two clusters in _ each _ of the @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and  bands .",
    "if the distance modulus of the ursa major cluster is taken to be 31.33 ( tully 1997 ) then pisces is at 33.88 , or 60 mpc .",
    "the cluster is given a velocity in the frame of the cosmic microwave background of @xmath151  by han & mould ( 1992 ) .",
    "the inferred value for the hubble constant is @xmath152 mpc@xmath104 .",
    "though our sample is moderate in number ( pared to 87 spirals in the final analysis ) it is reasonably well defined in terms of completion limits and we have photometric images in four bands ranging from @xmath2 , where there is considerable absorption , to  , where there is minuscule absorption .",
    "inclination effects of the sort attributable to extinction are seen in the scatter of linewidth  magnitude and color  magnitude correlations .",
    "more edge - on galaxies are fainter and redder in the mean .",
    "plots of deviations from the mean as a function of inclination provide a quantitative measure of the amplitude of absorption .",
    "similar results are found whether the residuals in linewidth  magnitude or color  magnitude relations are considered .",
    "the statistical significance of results are better with the color  magnitude analysis so we concentrate on those tests .    the claim by giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is confirmed that the extinction in spirals is luminosity dependent .",
    "galaxies with @xmath153 reaching @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) have up to @xmath156 of differential absorption between face - on and edge - on ( @xmath4 at @xmath3 , @xmath6 at @xmath5 , @xmath157 inferred at  ) . however the amplitude of extinction drops off rapidly with decreasing luminosity , becoming unmeasurable at @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "the corrections reach higher values than we entertained in the past ( tully & fouqu 1985 ) .",
    "we arrived at our old corrections from data on relatively nearby galaxies which have low luminosities in the mean .",
    "samples such as those studied by giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1994,1995 ) have larger mean redshifts , hence larger mean luminosities , and it can now be understood why such samples lead to larger absorption corrections .",
    "extinction corrections have been formulated in terms of the distance independent variable , linewidths , so they can be applied to distance estimators .",
    "the data assembled in this paper suggests @xmath152 mpc@xmath104 ."
