    "in ultracold @xmath2k and @xmath1li fermi gases , one can experimentally tune the strength of a pairing interaction by adjusting the threshold energy of a feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "this unique property enables us to study the bcs - bec crossover phenomenon@xcite , where the character of a fermi superfluid continuously changes from the weak - coupling bcs - type to the bec of tightly bound molecules , as one increases the strength of a pairing interaction@xcite . the intermediate coupling regime ( which is also referred to as the bcs - bec crossover region in the literature )",
    "is dominated by strong pairing fluctuations , so that this regime is particularly useful for the study of various many - body effects in a systematic manner .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is one of the most exciting topics in cold fermi gas physics@xcite .",
    "however , while the importance of pairing fluctuations in the bcs - bec crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas is now widely accepted , details of resulting many - body phenomena are still in debate .",
    "in particular , the existence of the pseudogap phenomenon has been extensively discussed both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite . while the photoemission - type experiments on a three - dimensional@xcite and a two - dimensional@xcite @xmath2k fermi gas support the pseudogap scenario@xcite , the local pressure experiment@xcite , as well as the experiment on the spin polarization rate@xcite on @xmath1li fermi gases support the fermi liquid theory . between the latter two experiments ,",
    "it has been pointed out that the former can be explained by a strong - coupling theory including pseudogap effects@xcite .",
    "thus , on the viewpoint of the pseudogap scenario , it is an important challenge to explain the latter experiment on the spin - polarization rate within the framework of a pseudogap theory .",
    "since the normal fermi liquid is characterized by long - lived fermi quasi - particles near the fermi surface , it is quite different from the pseudogapped state , where the lifetime of fermi atoms is very short near the fermi level , because of the formation of preformed cooper pairs .",
    "thus , whether an ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region is a fermi liquid or a pseudogapped fermi gas is a crucial issue in cold fermi gas physics . since the pseudogap phenomenon has been extensively discussed in the under - doped regime of high-@xmath3 cuprates@xcite , this problem is also important to assess the preformed - pair scenario discussed in this strongly correlated electron system@xcite .    in this paper , we investigate strong - coupling properties of a unitary fermi gas with population imbalance , to clarify whether or not the recent experiment on the spin polarization rate@xcite can be explained within the pseudogap scenario . in considering this problem",
    ", we note that ref.@xcite assumes that , if the pseudogap really exists in an unpolarized fermi gas , this effect should still remain even in the spin - polarized case . under this assumption",
    ", they extrapolate their experimental data in the highly spin - polarized regime to the unpolarized limit , leading to the conclusion that the pseudogap does not exist in the absence of population imbalance .",
    "thus , to accomplish our purpose , a crucial key is to clarify to what extent the pseudogap phenomenon is sensitive / insensitive to the presence of population imbalance .    in the spin - polarized case",
    ", it is known that the ordinary gaussian fluctuation theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite , as well as the ( non - self - consistent ) @xmath0-matrix approximation@xcite , that have been extensively used to clarify various interesting bcs - bec crossover phenomena in the unpolarized case , breakdown@xcite . to overcome this serious problem ,",
    "we have recently presented a minimal extension of the @xmath0-matrix theory to include higher order pairing fluctuations@xcite . the calculated spin susceptibility in this extended @xmath0-matrix approximation ( etma)@xcite quantitatively agrees well with the recent experiment on a @xmath1li fermi gas@xcite , without introducing any fitting parameter . in this paper",
    ", we also employ this strong - coupling theory , to examine the pseudogap phenomenon in a spin - polarized unitary fermi gas . within the same framework",
