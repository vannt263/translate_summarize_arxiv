    "edge states of topological systems give rise to a striking set of coherent quantum phenomena .",
    "for example , chiral edge states of two - dimensional quantum hall systems lead to precisely quantized hall conductance at zero temperature .",
    "however in thermal systems with non - zero temperature , these edge - state properties are washed out due to thermal excitations that communicate between opposite edges of the system .",
    "such deleterious thermal effects can sometimes be mitigated by careful cooling and isolation . nevertheless , it is interesting and potentially useful to ask whether one can obtain systems with topological edge state properties that are immune to thermal washing out , circumventing the need for cooling .",
    "an intriguing possibility arises from the study of many - body localization ( mbl ) - a phenomenon whereby well - isolated quantum systems fail to thermalize due to the localization of excitations by strong disorder @xcite . in mbl systems ,",
    "disorder can protect quantum coherence against such thermal degradation by localizing the offending excitations . in this fashion certain coherent quantum phenomena including symmetry breaking and",
    "topological order may survive in mbl systems at non - zero energy density ( the appropriate analog of finite temperature in non - thermal systems ) @xcite .",
    "this naturally raises the question of whether topological edge states can be protected by localization of the bulk states . here ,",
    "we face a new complication not present in previous examples of localization protected quantum order : topological bands in fermionic systems can not be completely localized by disorder .",
    "rather , the non - trivial band - topology guarantees the existence of an extended single - particle ( sp ) bulk orbital at some critical sp energy @xmath4@xcite ( or more generally a discrete set of such extended orbitals ) .",
    "sp orbitals with energy @xmath5 near @xmath4 exhibit diverging sp localization length @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath1 is an exponent whose value depends on the particular system under consideration ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we dub such systems  marginally localized . \"",
    "[ fig : divergingloclength ]    examples include : disordered integer quantum hall systems @xcite and chiral superconductors , intrinsically topological superconductors @xcite , and symmetry protected topological phases ( e.g. topological insulators ) with symmetry - preserving disorder @xcite .",
    "here , the diverging localization length accompanies each change in the topological edge - state structure ( e.g. the chern - number changing quantum hall plateau to plateau transitions ) .",
    "the presence of at least one extended state is guaranteed by the topological obstruction to constructing localized wannier orbitals in a topological band @xcite . in the vicinity of the critical energy ,",
    "the sp localization length diverges as in eq .",
    "[ eq : divergingxi ] .",
    "a diverging sp localization length can occur in non - topological contexts , such as 1d xx spin chains with random bond disorder ( or equivalently , non - interacting fermion chains with random hopping ) .",
    "such marginally localized systems have properties intermediate between localized and extended systems , as we shall discuss in sec.ii .",
    "a central issue is whether marginal localization persists away from the non - interacting limit . in fully localized systems ( @xmath7 for all @xmath5 )",
    "there is strong evidence that localization survives the addition of weak interactions even at non - zero energy density @xcite .",
    "in contrast , interactions are expected to delocalize a system whose single particle ( sp ) spectrum contains a mobility edge , as a generic excited state will contain a finite density of occupied extended orbitals that thermalize among themselves and then act as a bath for the localized orbitals . in the presence of a non - zero coupling to a bath ,",
    "the many body wave functions become thermal , and localization is destroyed , even though signatures of proximity to localization may survive in the spectral functions of local operators @xcite .",
    "even if extended states only arise in a narrow energy range of width @xmath8 , the results of @xcite suggest that this narrow band of extended states will be sufficient to destroy localization , for any non - zero @xmath8 .",
    "however , for marginally localized phases , extended states arise only at a single energy @xmath4 . in the language of @xcite , these extended states constitute a bath with vanishing bandwidth , and it is not a priori clear whether this will be sufficient to destroy localization upon inclusion of interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we give analytic arguments showing that localization is impossible for arbitrarily weak interaction strength if @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is the spatial dimension .",
    "the breakdown of localization originates from a proliferation of multi - particle resonances between well separated single - particle orbitals .",
    "notably , such breakdown occurs in disordered integer quantum hall systems for which @xmath10@xcite .",
    "moreover , in the generic case of systems that are governed by the harris / chayes bound , @xmath11 , and which have a non - zero density of states ( e.g. integer quantum hall systems ) , our arguments preclude the existence of many body localization at finite energy density in partially filled bands where the localization length diverges at a discrete set of energies .",
    "our arguments do not exclude many body localization in systems that evade the harris bound due to symmetry reasons , and have @xmath12 .",
    "it also does not exclude localization in systems where the density of states vanishes sufficiently rapidly at the critical energy .",
    "for example , in a system where the density of states vanishes as @xmath13 , the breakdown of localization only occurs if @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the harris / chayes bound applies to the critical exponent for the _ mean _ localization length , while our argument involves the critical exponent of the _ typical _ localization length , so there remains a possibility of marginal localization in systems where the mean and typical localization lengths diverge with very different exponents .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : properties ] we review the properties of marginally localized phases in the absence of interactions . in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model of interest , and the basic approach . in section",
    "iv we derive a condition for the perturbative instability of marginal localization . the analysis in section",
    "iv initially assumes that the wave functions are uniform on length scales less than a localization length , and decay exponentially on longer length scales .",
    "this is an oversimplification , since the wave functions close to criticality have multifractal character on length scales short compared to the localization length . in section iv - h",
    "we take this multifractality into account , and demonstrate that it does not alter our essential results . in section v we discuss the consequences of our results , and use the harris / chayes argument @xcite to rule out stability of marginal localization in a wide class of models , including the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of perturbatively stable marginal localization in systems that exploit certain loopholes in our argument , which we discuss .",
    "before analyzing the effects of interactions , we begin by reviewing the properties of marginally localized phases in the absence of interactions . in this , and all that follows",
    ", we consider the case of only a single critical energy , @xmath15 and shift our sp energy scale such that @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the sp density of states is regular and non - zero in the vicinity of @xmath15 .",
    "we work at partial filling in the band at a non - zero energy density ( i.e. we are not discussing ground states or low lying excited states ) . in the quantum hall context , this amounts to working at a non - zero temperature , but a temperature that is still much less than the cyclotron frequency ( allowing us to focus on a single landau sub band ) .",
    "marginally localized states show anomalous subdiffusive dynamics , as is known from previous studies of dynamics in disordered quantum hall systems@xcite .",
    "these results are reproduced by the following simple argument .",
    "consider the relaxation of a wave packet @xmath17 initially localized in the vicinity of @xmath18 .",
    "the wave packet can be written in the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the single particle states with energy @xmath21 and amplitude @xmath22 at a position @xmath23 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath24 are appropriate complex amplitudes that produce a localized wave packet .",
    "the wave functions @xmath25 are all localized , with energy dependent localization lengths , @xmath26 as in eq .  [ eq : divergingxi ] .",
    "this wave packet has the time evolution @xmath27 .",
    "we can now straightforwardly evaluate the spatial spreading of the wave packet by examining @xmath28 where the second line is valid at long times when the phases between states with @xmath29 have effectively randomized , and in going to the third line we have assumed that the spreading in each energy interval is diffusive up to the localization length at that energy , and have allowed for the possibility that the diffusion  constant \" varies with energy .",
    "the diffusion constant at an energy @xmath5 may be estimated by setting the thouless energy @xmath30 equal to the level spacing @xmath31 at that energy , giving @xmath32 .",
    "the long - time dynamics will turn out to be controlled by states near the critical energy @xmath4 . in dimensions",
    "the singular behavior of @xmath34 near the critical energy will translate into a singular behavior of @xmath35 .",
    "however , in two dimensions ( the case relevant for quantum hall ) , the singularity in @xmath34 will not translate into a singularity in @xmath36 , and thus we may replace @xmath35 by a constant value @xmath37 , the diffusion constant for the states near the critical energy . moreover , the detailed initial initial structure of the wave - packet is irrelevant for the long - time asymptotics , which are captured by simply taking @xmath38 to be roughly equal amplitude for all energies @xmath21 within a bandwidth @xmath39 of @xmath4 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the spreading of the wave - packet follows : @xmath40 in the fourth line we have defined the integration limit @xmath41 through @xmath42 \\approx \\xi_0 ^ 2{\\left(}\\frac{e(t)}{\\lambda}{\\right)}^{-2\\nu } = d_0t$ ] , i.e. @xmath43 . the behavior is qualitatively different for @xmath44 and for @xmath45 .",
    "however , provided the harris / chayes argument@xcite applies ( see discussion in appendix ) , @xmath46 , and only the latter case is relevant .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution comes from low - energy states with diverging @xmath47 , i.e. from the 1st term in eq .",
    "[ eq : r2 ] and from the lower end with @xmath48 in the 2nd term of eq .",
    "[ eq : r2 ] , and we obtain @xmath49 thus the dynamics are characterized by the dynamical exponent @xmath50 intermediate between diffusive ( @xmath51 ) and localized ( @xmath52 ) scaling , and taking the numerical value @xmath53 in the case of integer quantum hall .      the sub diffusive spreading eq .",
    "[ eq : subdiffusion ] can be interpreted as a length - scale dependent diffusion  constant \" : @xmath54 . using the usual einstein relation between diffusion and conductivity ,",
    "these considerations predict scale dependent dc conductivity @xmath55 which vanishes in the the thermodynamic limit .",
    "again we see scaling intermediate between the constant conductivity @xmath56 of an extended system and the exponential scaling @xmath57 of a localized system .",
    "entanglement scaling provides insight into the character of many - body eigenstates , and provides a conceptually powerful means to distinguish extended and localized systems .",

    "@xmath0 is the number of spatial dimensions . in extended systems ,",
    "such boundary law scaling occurs only for the ground - states , whereas excited states typically display volume law scaling @xmath61 . in this section",

    ", a fraction @xmath62 states are extended across the sub - region of size @xmath58 ( i.e. have @xmath63 ) , and make a volume - law type contribution to entanglement @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 , this dominates the area - law contribution from well - localized states leading to a scaling : @xmath66 intermediate between volume law and area - law , which we dub  fractal \" entanglement scaling as it scales like the boundary of a fractal sub - region of a localized phase with fractional dimension @xmath67 .",
    "marginally localized systems exhibit fractal entanglement scaling so long as @xmath68 . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the entanglement entropy becomes effectively area law .",
    "when applicable , a harris - type criterion ( see app .",
    "[ app : harris ] ) @xmath70 ensures that the fraction of modes which are extended on the length scale @xmath58 dominate the entanglement entropy in all systems with @xmath71 .",
    "integer quantum hall systems have @xmath10 , and will exhibit fractal entanglement scaling",
    ". however harris / chayes arguments do not rule out that some marginally localized systems exhibit conventional boundary - law scaling in spatial dimensions @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we see that in dynamics , response properties , and the scaling of entanglement entropy , marginally localized non - interacting systems display properties that are intermediate between traditional localized systems and delocalized systems .",
    "next , we investigate whether this intermediate behavior survives in the presence of interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of interest takes the form @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the hamiltonian of the disordered non - interacting fermion system ( for example landau levels with disorder ) .",
    "this non - interacting hamiltonian has single - particle eigenmodes of energy @xmath21 created by operators @xmath75 , where @xmath76 creates an electron at position @xmath77 .",
    "meanwhile , the interaction term takes the form @xmath78 this represents a short range interaction of strength @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the matrix elements of the interaction in the eigen - basis of @xmath74 .",
    "we consider the simplest case ( illustrated in fig .  [ fig : divergingloclength]b ) where the sp localization length diverges only at one sp energy , @xmath4 , and choose our zero of energy to set @xmath81 .",
    "the localization lengths for energies close to zero then diverge as @xmath82 , such that at any length scale @xmath83 , a non - zero fraction @xmath84 of the states appear extended .",
    "we take the sp density of states to be a non - zero constant in the vicinity of @xmath85 . for generality",
    "we will keep the spatial dimensionality @xmath0 and the localization - length exponent @xmath1 arbitrary , for example @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the disordered integer quantum hall plateau @xcite .",
    "we now ask whether inclusion of the interaction causes a breakdown of localization .",
    "we begin by noting that if we attempt to construct the many body eigenstates perturbatively in weak interactions , then perturbation theory for the eigenstates will break down already at @xmath88 for states involving sp orbitals sufficiently close to the mobility edge , irrespective of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the fact that the eigenstates can not be perturbatively constructed does not imply that localization itself is unstable - to address the stability of localization we need a more sophisticated diagnostic .",
    "it has been pointed out that fully many - body localized systems are locally integrable in the sense that all eigenstates can be completely specified by a set of exponentially well - localized conserved , commuting quantities or ",
    "integrals of motion\"@xcite . for non - interacting systems",
    "the integrals of motion are simply the occupation numbers of single - particle orbitals . in an mbl phase , these integrals of motion are dressed by interactions but ( apart from a exponentially small fraction of rare resonances@xcite ) retain their localized character . in this spirit",
    ", one could take the defining property of marginally localized systems to be the existence of a ( nearly ) complete set of algebraically well - localized integrals of motion . here ,",
    "algebraically well - localized means that the fraction of integrals of motion with appreciable support on scale larger than @xmath58 decays as a power law in @xmath58 , ( unlike traditional mbl systems where it decays exponentially in @xmath58 , and also unlike a delocalized system , where the integrals of motion are not localized ) , and the caveat  nearly \" allows for a possible set of non - percolating resonances .",
    "we wish to investigate whether this picture of marginal localization can be stable in the presence of interactions . to this end",
    ", we first introduce some notation .",
    "we use @xmath89 to denote a ( many - body ) eigenstate of @xmath74 at an energy @xmath5 , labelled by a particular set of marginally localized integrals of motion , in the sense described above .",
    "we use @xmath90 to denote a ( many - body ) eigenstate of @xmath91 at an energy @xmath5 .",
    "we now introduce the @xmath92 matrix of the problem by @xmath93 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath92 between sp states with energy @xmath5 and spatial separation @xmath58 gives the effective matrix element for long range hopping .",
    "it is well known that the effective hopping matrix element must fall off with distance faster than @xmath94 , else localization is impossible @xcite .",
    "similarly , the matrix elements of @xmath92 between two particle states with the particles separated by a distance @xmath58 gives the effective matrix element for a long range two - body interaction , the matrix elements between three particle states give the effective matrix element for a long range three - body interaction etc .",
    "again , there are conditions on how fast these matrix elements must fall off with @xmath58 in order for localization to be stable @xcite .",
    "our main strategy in the present work will be to determine how the matrix elements of @xmath92 fall off with distance @xmath58 between the particles involved .",
    "hence , we will obtain a condition on @xmath1 for breakdown of localization .",
    "the @xmath92 matrix is related to @xmath95 by the dyson equation @xcite @xmath96 this expression fully specifies the @xmath92 matrix for states at a particular energy @xmath5 .",
    "we note that even though @xmath95 is short range , @xmath92 can have long range matrix elements because @xmath97 has eigenstates with arbitrarily long range matrix elements . within perturbation theory in small @xmath95 , we can approximate the @xmath92 matrix by the born series @xmath98 this perturbative expression can be represented in standard diagrammatic perturbation theory , where @xmath99 is represented by a ( directed ) line , and @xmath79 is represented by a vertex with two lines going in and two coming out .",
    "the diagrammatic representation of the @xmath92 matrix contains only connected diagrams .",
    "we use @xmath101 to denote the matrix element of @xmath92 between incoming state @xmath102 and outgoing state @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath101 exceeds the level spacing between states @xmath102 and @xmath103 then these two states are ` in resonance , ' and the occupation number of state @xmath102 can not be an integral of motion . however ,",

    "the occupation number of @xmath104 and @xmath105 can then be an integral of motion ( at least if the states are not resonant with any third state @xmath107 ) .",
    "however , the new integrals of motion will have support wherever @xmath102 and @xmath103 had support .",
    "we see therefore that the spatial structure of resonances is crucial .",
    "if resonances only occur between states that have support at nearby points in real space , then we may be able to define new integrals of motion which are still localized , if the local resonances do not percolate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if resonances occur on all length scales , then the integrals of motion will not be localized ( even algebraically ) , and so the system will not be able to support marginal mbl .",
    "the question we are interested in asking is thus the following : if @xmath102 is an eigenstate of @xmath74 with localization length @xmath108 , then what is the probability that @xmath102 is ` in resonance ' with another state @xmath103 a distance @xmath58 apart , where @xmath109 ( the situation when @xmath110 constitutes a local resonance , which just redefines the localized integrals of motion ) .",
    "if the probability of having a resonance at a distance greater than @xmath58 goes to zero as @xmath111 , then we will be able to define algebraically localized integrals of motion with arbitrary precision , in the sense that all but a fraction @xmath112 of the integrals of motion will be localized on a length scale @xmath113 , where @xmath113 is set by the condition that the probability of having a resonance at a length scale greater than @xmath114 is equal to @xmath112 .",

    "the first order term @xmath95 is purely short range .",
    "long range terms first appear at order ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "we now examine the how the matrix elements of @xmath92 fall off with distance at @xmath117 .",

    "this establishes that localization is impossible in the presence of interactions if @xmath182 this is the main result of this section , and concludes our discussion of the matrix elements of @xmath92 at @xmath117 ( we note that @xmath92 has no matrix elements between four particle states at @xmath117 because @xmath92 must be represented by a connected diagram ) .",
    "next , we discuss whether we can get a more stringent condition for breakdown of localization at higher orders in @xmath79 .",
    "we now discuss whether a more stringent condition on breakdown of localization could be obtained by going to higher order in @xmath79 and considering diagrams , e.g. of the sort illustrated in fig.[fig : highorderff ] .",
    "\\a ) b )    we will conclude that the answer is no , and that ( [ result ] ) is the criterion for perturbative breakdown of marginal localization .",
    "we begin by noting that the diagrammatic representation of the born series ( [ born ] ) contains vertices , internal lines ( which begin and end on a vertex ) , and external lines ( which are connected to vertices only at one end ) . at @xmath183 in perturbation theory",
    ", we will have @xmath184 vertices , @xmath185 internal lines and @xmath186 external lines , where @xmath187 .",
    "since only connected diagrams contribute to the @xmath92 matrix , every vertex must be connected to at least one internal line , and all but two of the vertices must be connected to at least two internal lines .",
    "this gives the constraint @xmath188 .",
    "now , the @xmath58 scaling depends only on the number of internal lines @xmath185 . after summing over internal variables in a rms sense , we find that the @xmath58 scaling has the form @xmath189^m}\\ ] ] where the first factor @xmath190 comes about when we change the sum over states to an integral , and the second factor @xmath191 comes from the normalization factors associated with the internal lines .",
    "this gives @xmath192    now , if we evaluate the matrix element of @xmath92 that connects a particle at a given position to particles at @xmath193 other positions within a ball of radius @xmath58 ( i.e. if we look at diagrams containing @xmath194 vertices that are connected to at least one external line ) , then the minimum level spacing for such processes will fall off as @xmath195 .",
    "if this level spacing falls off faster than the corresponding matrix element , then the probability of having resonances will approach one at large @xmath58 , so that localization will be unstable .",
    "the condition for delocalization thus takes the form @xmath196 thus , to maximize our chances of delocalization , we should maximize @xmath193 and should minimize @xmath185 , subject to the contraints we have already identified @xmath197 and @xmath198 . substituting @xmath199 and @xmath200 into the above formula , we find that the condition for delocalization becomes @xmath201 thus , the tightest constraint that we could possibly get within perturbation theory is the constraint ( [ result ] ) coming from the flip - flop mediated hopping process i.e. delocalization occurs if @xmath202 .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath203 , the probability of resonances vanishes at large @xmath58 at all orders in perturbation theory , so that marginal localization appears to be perturbatively stable .",
    "for @xmath204 the probability of having a resonance , calculated in the manner of ( 13 ) , grows logarithmically with @xmath58 , suggesting that the system should be delocalized ( this is also consistent with results on non - interacting models with critically long range hopping @xcite ) .",
    "the result ( [ result ] ) is slightly modified if the density of states vanishes as @xmath205 in the vicinity of the critical energy . in this case , the integrals over energy come with a factor of @xmath205 , and the matrix elements with @xmath185 internal lines are of order @xmath206 in this case similar arguments establish that delocalization occurs if @xmath207 the situation where the density of states diverges at the critical energy can also be treated within the above formalism , by taking @xmath208 .",
    "we now draw attention to a very simple and intuitive explanation for the delocalization criterion ( [ result ] ) . on any length scale @xmath58 , there are states with energies @xmath209 that look effectively extended . meanwhile , there are @xmath210 states at an energy @xmath5 that have support at a particular position @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the number of states to which we can couple with a local interaction which are extended on the scale @xmath58 is @xmath211 if @xmath212 then the ` bath ' of extended states to which we can locally couple contains a finite number of states ( and the number of states in the bath goes at zero as the length scale @xmath111 ) . in this case",
    ", localization can be perturbatively stable .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath213 , then the above integral diverges near @xmath85 , such that the ` bath ' to which we can locally couple contains an infinite number of extended states at any length scale @xmath58 . in this case , the algebraically delocalized states near the critical energy form a good bath , and are able to thermalize the system by mediating long range interactions that fall off sufficiently slowly with @xmath58 , as we have discussed .",
    "we now estimate the length scale and timescale for the resonances that give rise to a breakdown of localization .",
    "recall that the @xmath214 matrix elements between states separated by a distance @xmath58 at order @xmath215 in perturbation theory scale as @xmath216 , while the level spacing scales as @xmath217 .",
    "the length scale @xmath218 on which resonances appear at order @xmath215 in perturbation theory is the length scale at which the matrix elements and the level spacings become comparable i.e. @xmath219 .",
    "this happens at a critical length scale @xmath114 , where @xmath220 by inspection , the smallest @xmath114 comes from @xmath221 for which @xmath222 the scaling of @xmath114 in eq .",
    "[ rc ] controls , for example , the length scale at which the longitudinal conductivity ceases to follow ( [ eq : dcconductivity ] ) and saturates instead to a non - zero constant . remarkably , even though breakdown of perturbation theory occurs already at second order in perturbation theory , the shortest length scale on which resonances appear is controlled by high orders of perturbation theory .",
    "we can also estimate the timescale on which breakdown of localization occurs .",
    "processes at order @xmath215 cause a breakdown on length scales @xmath218 , given by ( [ eq : rcn ] ) .",
    "the matrix element for these processes is of order @xmath223 , and the level spacing is @xmath224 , so that the density of final states is @xmath225 .",
    "a straightforward application of the golden rule implies that the timescale on which breakdown of localization happens due to processes at @xmath215 order in perturbation theory is @xmath226 thus we see that the shortest timescale on which breakdown occurs is controlled by @xmath227 ( i.e. by processes at second order in perturbation theory ) , and is of order @xmath228 for the case of integer quantum hall , with @xmath229 and @xmath86 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "we note that the crossover timescales @xmath114 and @xmath232 both diverge as @xmath233 , recovering marginal localization in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "so far we have suppressed temperature - dependent occupation factors in estimating the t - matrix amplitudes .",
    "the breakdown of marginal localization happens ( for a closed quantum system ) because the ` internal heat bath ' presented by the states with diverging localization length allows the system to thermalize . at low temperature ,",
    "the coupling to this internal bath is suppressed by a factor of @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the detuning of the chemical potential from the critical energy - i.e. the crossover scales @xmath114 and @xmath232 will be enhanced by an ` arrhenius ' factor @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is a positive numerical pre factor that depends on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the crossover scales will also diverge in the zero temperature limit , so that the zero temperature system will indeed be localized , as long as the fermi level is not at the critical energy .",
    "the emergence of a new length scale and timescale in the interacting problem suggests that the scaling behavior near the zero temperature quantum critical point @xcite may be richer for the interacting system than for the non - interacting system . in particular",
    ", the presence of an additional interaction related length scale @xmath114 may help explain why the experimentally observed longitudinal conductance is not temperature independent at the critical point @xcite - the longitudinal conductance could depend on the ratio of @xmath114 to the thermal length @xmath239 .",
    "additionally , if one examines the scaling of e.g. the longitudinal conductance with temperature at a non - zero detuning @xmath236 from the critical point , then the coupling to the ` internal ' heat bath will provide a mechanism for a thermally activated scaling of the conductance , with an activation gap proportional to the detuning from the critical point . of course , any real experimental system",
    "will also be coupled to an ` external ' heat bath ( e.g phonons ) , which will allow for variable range hopping at any non - zero temperature , and this variable range hopping contribution to the conductance will dominate over the ` activated ' contribution at the lowest temperatures .",
    "however , if one observed a regime where the low temperature longitudinal conductance was activated , with an activation gap proportional to the detuning from criticality , then this may be tentatively identified as evidence for the ` delocalization due to the internal bath ' discussed in this paper .",
    "an additional complication is that we have considered short range interactions , while in real quantum hall systems there are also coulomb interactions ( unless screened by a nearby metallic gate ) .",
    "the inclusion of long - range coulomb interactions may introduce additional corrections to scaling that are not captured by the present theory .",
    "thus far we have assumed that the wave functions were uniform on length scales short compared to @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , this is not the case , because close to criticality the wave functions exhibit multi fractal behavior on length scales less than @xmath34 .",
    "it is known @xcite that for wave functions close to criticality , the disorder averaged two point correlations fall off as @xmath240 for @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is a multi fractal exponent .",
    "this suggests that the wave functions actually have higher amplitudes on scales @xmath243 than would be expected based on the ` plain vanilla ' model we were working with thus far .",
    "this will tend to _ enhance _ the matrix elements of the @xmath92 matrix over and above the estimates above .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath244 may be viewed as a lower bound condition for delocalization .",
    "if we take into account the effects of multifractality in a simple minded way by attaching a factor of @xmath245 to each internal line , then we will conclude that the contribution to the @xmath92 matrix from a diagram with @xmath185 internal lines ( after rms summation over internal variables ) will be @xmath246^m } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim & r^{-\\frac{m}{2}\\left(d+\\frac{1+\\upsilon}{\\nu}\\right)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is independent of @xmath138 - i.e. if we take multifractality into account in this simple minded way then the threshold for delocalization is unchanged , and is @xmath247 .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of multi - fractality may reduce the critical value of @xmath1 somewhat , but ( as we have discussed ) , multifractality can only make it _ easier _ to get delocalization .",
    "we have discussed marginally localized systems , which for partially filled bands at non - zero energy density are characterized in the non - interacting limit by sub diffusive relaxation ( [ eq : subdiffusion ] ) , a scale dependent dc conductivity that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit ( [ eq : dcconductivity ] ) and an entanglement entropy of the excited eigenstates that is intermediate between area law and volume law ( [ eq : entanglement ] ) .",
    "we have shown that such systems are generically unstable to interactions , since interactions trigger a breakdown of localization for any @xmath248 .",
    "we further note that , for most systems , general arguments ( @xcite and appendix ) place a lower bound , @xmath3 , on the localization length exponent .",
    "thus , we have shown that marginally localization is generically unstable to interactions , for partially filled bands at non - zero energy density .",
    "we therefore predict that in a marginally localized system such as integer quantum hall , the inclusion of arbitrarily weak short range interactions will cause the entanglement entropy in the excited many body eigenstates to become volume law , instead of the fractal scaling shown in ( [ eq : entanglement ] ) .",
    "we also predict that in two dimensional weakly interacting marginally localized systems , the scale dependent conductivity at nonzero energy density will follow ( [ eq : dcconductivity ] ) on small length scales , but will saturate to a non - zero constant on large length scales .",
    "similarly , relaxation in such marginally localized systems should be sub - diffusive according to ( [ eq : subdiffusion ] ) for short times , but should cross over to diffusive relaxation on long timescales .",
    "we have estimated the crossover length scales and timescales , and have also discussed in sec.iv-g the interaction induced corrections to scaling in the vicinity of the zero temperature quantum critical point .",
    "these ideas may be directly tested in experiments in cold - atomic systems and possibly also in solid - state materials for which the electron - phonon interactions are negligible , so that the electronic system well approximates an isolated quantum system .",
    "we speculate in particular that disordered graphene in the quantum hall regime may provide a playground to test these ideas , due to its weak electron - phonon coupling and isolation from any substrate in suspended devices .",
    "while our arguments were for short range interactions , the question of whether mbl can survive with long range interactions has also been recently studied @xcite .",
    "it was claimed there that full mbl is perturbatively stable against weak interactions as long as the interactions fall off with distance faster than @xmath249 , where @xmath186 is a critical power that depends on the model in question . for interactions that fall off faster than @xmath249",
    ", our arguments can be straightforwardly generalized to demonstrate that marginal localization is perturbatively unstable .",
    "the situation with truly long range interactions ( which fall off slower than @xmath249 ) , is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we note that there are three classes of short range interacting system that may evade our arguments .",
    "if the divergence in the localization length is accompanied by a density of states ( dos ) which vanishes as @xmath205 , our argument only predicts delocalization for @xmath250 . given a sufficiently rapid vanishing of the dos at the critical energy , marginal localization could be perturbatively stable .",
    "additionally , in systems where the critical energy is pinned ( e.g. by symmetry ) to a particular value and is locally insensitive to disorder , the harris criterion does not apply and we can have @xmath251 ( see @xcite and appendix ) . a particular example of this is models of particle - hole symmetric localization in one dimension @xcite , where the divergence in the localization length is only a logarithmic function of energy . in this case our analysis would suggest that marginal localization could be perturbatively stable .",
    "finally , our arguments establish that marginal localization is unstable for @xmath248 , where @xmath1 is the critical exponent for the localization length of _ typical _ states .",
    "however , the harris / chayes criteria only constrain the critical exponent for the _ mean _ localization length @xmath252 . for infinite randomness critical points , @xmath253 and @xmath254 can be markedly different@xcite .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that there may be systems with infinite randomness critical points where @xmath252 ( satisfying harris / chayes ) , but @xmath255 , so that marginal localization could be perturbatively stable .",
    "investigations of whether such marginally localized systems can be stable to interactions would be a fruitful topic for future work .",
