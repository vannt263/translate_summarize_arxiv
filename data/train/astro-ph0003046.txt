    "dark matter is a necessary ingredient in the standard big bang model of the universe .",
    "its presence has an impact from subgalactic dynamics to the global evolution of the universe .",
    "however , the nature of the dark matter remains unknown .",
    "so far , the cold dark matter model has been very successful in explaining how structure forms @xcite . in this model the dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which are extremely non - relativistic when structure formation begins . because they are so massive they do not free stream and perturbations on small scales are preserved . in the 1980s",
    "it was realised that cdm produces too much small - scale structure , and that some modification of the model is needed .",
    "several possibilities exist : there could be a large component of hot dark matter damping small scale fluctuations or there could be a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "recent data from type ia supernovae indeed suggest that the energy density of the universe is dominated by a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem with cdm is at first sight remedied .",
    "however , in the past few years very high resolution n - body simulations of structure formation have shown that any type of cdm model produces far too much substructure on galactic scales , compared with observations .",
    "the halo of a galaxy like our own should contain of the order 1000 distinct subhaloes , a factor of ten more than is found by observations @xcite .",
    "another , related problem is that galaxies are predicted to have singular cores .",
    "navarro , frenk and white @xcite found that n - body simulations predicted a universal core profile of halos where @xmath0 .",
    "later simulations with higher resolution find an even steeper profile @xcite . at the same time",
    "galactic rotation curves indicate dark matter halos with finite cores , i.e. constant core density @xcite .",
    "this problem is very severe and is consistently found in all simulations .    if the details of star formation and feedback do not solve the problem , then physics at a more fundamental level possibly could .",
    "one option is that the primordial power spectrum has a sharp drop at subgalactic scales so that substructure is prevented from forming @xcite .",
    "another option along this line is that the dark matter is not cold , but warm @xcite . in this model",
    "the dark matter particle mass should be around 1 kev so that the dark matter has significant thermal motion and perturbations on small scales are erased .",
    "however , the cut - off scale needed for the correct core radius of halos to be produced is so large that it is difficult to form the correct number of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "a radically different explanation was suggested by spergel and steinhardt @xcite , namely that the dark matter could be cold , but have significant self - interactions .",
    "if the mean free path of the dark matter particles is of the order the size of the collapsing system , then the core singularity would form much more slowly , while the outer parts of the halo would remain unchanged . recently ,",
    "a large number of papers have appeared which investigate this possibility numerically @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that if the interactions are very strong , the model does not fit observations @xcite .",
    "the halos become completely spherical apart from a small rotational deformation , and a singular core develops .",
    "however , it seems that models where the dark matter mean free path is similar to the system size produce halos closely resembling the observed ones @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the self - interacting matter could be in the form of a scalar field @xcite .",
    "that dark matter could have self - interactions is an old idea .",
    "it was originally suggested by raffelt and silk @xcite that hdm neutrinos could have strong self interactions . in this way",
    "free streaming would be suppressed and fluctuations only washed out via diffusion .",
    "the scenario was elaborated on by atrio - barandela and davidson @xcite who did a numerical study of this model .",
    "the possibility of number changing self interactions has also been considered @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we wish to explore the possibility that dark matter has both significant thermal motion and self - interactions .",
    "the self - interactions are assumed to consist only of two - particle scattering . in general",
    ", the inclusion of self interactions leads to less small scale suppression of perturbations because the small scale cut - off in power is given by the jeans scale which is smaller than the free - streaming scale .",
    "we find that self - interacting hot dark matter , as suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite , is clearly ruled out because it produces far too little small - scale structure .",
    "however , self interacting warm dark matter may be a viable possibility .",
    "strong self interactions push the power spectrum towards smaller scales by roughly a factor of 1.6 , which may make it consistent with observations .",
    "the evolution of any given particle species can be described via the boltzmann equation .",
    "our notation is identical to that of ma and bertschinger ( mb ) @xcite .",
    "we shall work in synchronous gauge because the numerical routine for calculating matter and cmb power spectra , cmbfast @xcite , is written in this gauge . as the time variable we use conformal time , defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the scale factor . also , as the momentum variable we shall use the comoving momentum @xmath3 .",
    "we further parametrize @xmath4 as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnitude of the comoving momentum and @xmath7 is a unit 3-vector specifying direction .",
    "the boltzmann equation can generically be written as @xmath8 = \\frac{df}{d\\tau } = c[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] is the liouville operator .",
    "the collision operator on the right - hand side describes any possible collisional interactions .",
    "we then write the distribution function as @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the unperturbed distribution function . for a standard fermion which decouples while relativistic ,",
    "this distribution function is simply @xmath12^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the present - day temperature of the species . for a self - interacting species in scattering equilibrium",
    "the distribution is instead @xmath14^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a chemical potential .",
    "this distribution is in general different from the one for collisionless particles , so that one might worry that a detailed calculation of @xmath17 is needed .",
    "however , the relevant quantity to look at for our purpose is the entropy per particle , @xmath18 , which is conserved for both interacting and non - interacting species ( note that this would not hold in a model with number - changing self interactions @xcite ) .",
    "this means that for instance @xmath19 .",
    "thus we do not need to worry about how the unperturbed distribution is changed by self - interactions .",
    "in practise we just assume that the distribution function is equal to what it would be for a collisionless species .    in synchronous gauge",
    "the boltzmann equation can be written as an evolution equation for @xmath20 in @xmath21-space @xcite @xmath22 = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\tau } + i \\frac{q}{\\epsilon } \\mu \\psi + \\frac{d \\ln f_0}{d \\ln q } \\left[\\dot{\\eta}-\\frac{\\dot{h}+6\\dot{\\eta } } { 2 } \\mu^2 \\right ] = \\frac{1}{f_0 } c[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .",

    "we then expand the perturbation as @xmath29 one can then write the collisionless boltzmann equation as a moment hierarchy for the @xmath30 by performing the angular integration of @xmath9 $ ] @xmath31 it should be noted here that the first two hierarchy equations are directly related to the energy - momentum conservation equation .",
    "this can be seen in the following way .",
    "let us define the density and pressure perturbations of the dark matter fluid as @xcite @xmath32 then energy and momentum conservation implies that @xcite @xmath33 by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0 ] ) over @xmath34 , one gets eq .",

    "( [ eq : mom ] ) .    _ collisional boltzmann equation ",
    "_ we now introduce interactions by lifting the restriction that @xmath28 = 0 $ ] .",
    "ideally , one should calculate the collision integrals in detail for some explicit interaction .",
    "however , we shall instead use the cruder , but more model independent relaxation time approximation . here ,",
    "the right hand side of the boltzmann equation is in general written as @xcite @xmath36 = -\\frac{\\psi}{\\tau},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the mean time between collisions . however , in this simple approximation we run the risk of not obeying the basic conservation laws . the collision term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0 ] ) is @xmath38 $ ] and the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) is @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "integrating these two terms over momentum space one gets the collision terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : energy]-[eq : mom ] ) to be @xmath40 d \\omega q^2 dq \\epsilon\\ ] ] and @xmath40 d \\omega q^2 dq \\mu q = k^i \\int c[f ] d \\omega q^2 dq q_i\\ ] ] respectively . however , any integral of the form @xmath40 d \\omega q^2 dq a,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is automatically zero because @xmath42 is a collisional invariant ( however , conservation of particle number ( @xmath43 ) only applies to @xmath44 scatterings ) . thus ,",
    "both the above integrals are zero , and the right hand side of the @xmath45 and 1 terms should be zero , reflecting that energy and momentum is conserved in each interaction .",
    "apart from these two terms we put @xmath36_{l \\geq 2 } = -\\frac{\\psi_l}{\\tau},\\ ] ] so that the full boltzmann hierarchy , including interactions , is @xmath46 in appendix a we discuss how the above set of equations relates to the equations used in other studies of self - interacting dark matter .    _ relaxation time  _",
    "we now need an expression for the collision time @xmath37 . in general we can write @xmath47 for relativistic particles scattering via exchange of a massive vector boson ( @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the vector boson mass and @xmath50 is the mass of the dark matter particle ) we have @xmath51 whereas for non - relativistic particles it is @xmath52 as an interpolation we use @xmath53.\\ ] ]",
    "using the above equations we have calculated matter and cmb power spectra for two different dark matter models : hdm ( @xmath54 ev ) and warm dark matter ( @xmath55 kev ) over a range of scattering cross sections . in practice we have incorporated the equations into the cmbfast code developed by seljak and zaldarriaga @xcite .",
    "all the models were done assuming that @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the conclusions are unchanged if a @xmath59cdm model is assumed , since our purpose here is only to show how self - interactions change the power spectra .",
    "1 shows the matter power spectrum in terms of the quantity @xmath60 for our two different cases . in both cases ,",
    "the power spectrum cut - off is pushed towards higher @xmath21 if self - interaction is assumed .",
    "the hdm ( @xmath61 ev ) results are in agreement with the results of atrio - barandela and davidson @xcite , for @xmath21 smaller than the cut - off scale . at small scales ,",
    "their results are somewhat different from ours , probably because of an erroneous term in their perturbation equations ( as explained in the appendix ) .    for our choice of particle masses ,",
    "the dividing line between the non - interacting and strongly interacting regimes is roughly at @xmath62    = 12truecm    note that this is much lower than the cross section which is needed to explain structure on galactic scales in the self - interacting cold dark matter model . in that case , the dividing line is closer to @xmath63 . for the case where the dark matter is hot , self - interactions are not able to improve the agreement with observations significantly because the power spectrum cut - off is still at much too large a scale . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , warm dark matter provides a good fit to observations of dwarf galaxies if the power spectrum cut - off is at roughly @xmath64 , corresponding to a mass of 1 kev .",
    "however , explaining the core structure of dark matter halos requires that @xmath65 ev @xcite , so that even though the uncertainties involved in determining the best cut - off scale are as large as a factor two @xcite , the collisionless warm dark matter model is inconsistent with observations .",
    "our results indicate that it might be possible to lower the warm dark matter particle mass to this smaller value and compensate by making the warm dark matter self - interacting , which decreases the cut - off length scale by about a factor of 1.6 compared to the non - self - interacting case .",
    "numerically we find that the @xmath21 where @xmath66 takes its maximum value is well approximated by @xmath67 for the collisionless case this corresponds to the free - streaming scale , whereas in the strongly interacting case it corresponds to the jeans scale for a given particle mass . from this result",
    "we conclude that self - interacting warm dark matter is marginally consistent with the present observational constraints .    for the cmb",
    ", the fluctuations are usually expressed in terms of the @xmath68 coefficients , @xmath69 , where the @xmath70 coefficients are determined in terms of the real angular temperature fluctuations as @xmath71 .",
    "2 shows the cmb spectra for the same two particle masses .",
    "if the dark matter is hot , the cmb spectrum is changed relative to cold dark matter , because the dm particles are not completely non - relativistic at recombination .",
    "this gives rise to what is called the early integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "self - interactions have very little impact because they only affect scales within the dark matter sound horizon at recombination .",
    "even for a dark matter mass of 10 ev , this is at too small a scale to have a significant impact . for a dark matter particle mass of 1 kev ,",
    "the effects are completely negligible .",
    "our results for non - self - interacting warm dark matter agree with those of burns @xcite ; we have extended his results to demonstrate that the addition of self - interactions to the warm dark matter model also produces a negligible difference from standard cdm .",
    "we have performed a quantitative calculation of the linear behaviour of warm dark matter models with possible self interactions .",
    "as expected , power on small scales is generally increased in self - interacting models because free streaming is suppressed . in collisionless models ,",
    "power is suppressed on the free streaming scale , whereas in strongly self - interacting models the cut - off is at the jeans scale .",
    "this increase in the amplitude of the fluctuations on small scales has the effect of pushing the cut - off in the power spectrum down to smaller scales by approximately a factor of 1.6",
    ". this may allow warm dark matter to better fit the dwarf galaxy observations for masses which are small enough to explain the core structure of dark matter halos , a result which could make warm dark matter a more viable dark matter candidate .",
    "our cmb results indicate that , like standard warm dark matter , self - interacting warm dark matter is indistinguishable from standard cold dark matter in terms of the cmb fluctuation spectrum .",
    "thus , it is one of the few variants on the standard model which will not be probed by future cmb experiments .",
    "any constraints on this model must therefore come from large - scale and galactic structure considerations .",
    "for instance , analysis of high-@xmath72 structure like damped ly-@xmath73 systems might lead to interesting constraints .",
    "note that the cross section for scattering of dark matter particles would have to be of the order @xmath74 in order to change the matter power spectrum significantly .",
    "this is orders of magnitude more than the cross sections typical in weak interactions , and at present there are no obvious candidates for such dark matter particles .",
    "however , it could well be that warm dark matter with relatively strong self - interactions could be in a mirror sector , in which case there are no real restrictions @xcite .",

    "rjs was supported by the department of energy ( de - fg02 - 91er40690 ) .",
    "all the numerical calculations have been performed using the publicly available code cmbfast developed by seljak and zaldarriaga @xcite .",
    "in the limit of very large scattering cross sections , the dark matter is kept in pressure equilibrium until the present .",
    "this is the type of evolution assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the evolution equations read @xmath75 by performing the appropriate momentum integrations this yields @xmath76 this equation is equivalent to eqs .",
