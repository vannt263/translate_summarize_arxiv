    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics can not be the ultimate theory .",
    "it is incomplete and contains too many free parameters , such as masses and quark mixing angles .",
    "the pattern of these parameters should be governed by a hidden mechanism yet to be discovered , and so the sm is believed to be a low - energy effective theory of a more fundamental theory at a higher energy scale , anticipated to be in the tev region and accessible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this would imply new symmetries , particles , dynamics , and flavour structure .",
    "the most exciting task of the lhc experiments will be to find this new physics , whatever it may be .",
    "this can be done either directly or indirectly .",
    "the direct approach , pursued mostly by the atlas and cms experiments , aims at the observation of new particles produced in lhc s proton - proton collisions at 14  tev . the indirect approach , on the other hand , consists in measuring quantum corrections in the decay of already known particles especially in flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) transitions , and looking for deviations from the sm predictions . at lhc",
    ", this will be best done by the lhcb experiment , which has been designed specifically for precise measurements of cp violation and rare decays of hadrons containing a @xmath2 quark .",
    "both approaches are complementary : while the indirect approach is sensitive to higher energy scales and may therefore sense a new effect earlier , the direct observation of any new particle is necessary to establish its unambiguous discovery as well as for measuring its main properties .",
    "new physics ( np ) at the tev scale needs to have a non - trivial flavour structure in order to provide the suppression mechanism for the already observed fcnc processes .",
    "only indirect measurements can access the phases of the new couplings and therefore shed light on the np flavour structure .",
    "one of the strategies for indirect searches in hadronic decays consists of measuring as many observables as possible that can be related to the magnitudes and phases of the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix describing the sm flavour structure in the quark sector .",
    "any inconsistency between the interpretation of these measurements within the ckm picture will be a sign of new physics .",
    "the most awaited progress in this area is a precise np - free determination of the ckm angle @xmath3 from tree - level processes .",
    "another strategy is to identify and measure single fcnc processes with good np discovery potential , _",
    "i.e. _ where np is likely to emerge and for which a clear sm prediction can be made",
    ". decays involving the @xmath4 transition , which is less constrained by the current data , are good candidates .",
    "they are theoretically calculated using the operator product expansion in terms of short - distance wilson coefficients and long - distance operators describing effective vertexes such as tree diagrams , or gluon- , photon- , electroweak- , scalar- and pseudoscalar - penguin loops .",
    "new physics may both enhance some of the wilson coefficients or introduce new operators , in particular in the right - handed sector which is suppressed in the sm .",
    "following these strategies , lhcb is preparing to perform rate measurements ( such as the @xmath5 branching fraction ) , determine cp - violating phases ( most notably mixing - induced effects in @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays , interference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 transitions in tree - level @xmath10 decays , cp asymmetries in charmless two - body @xmath11 decays ) , and probe the helicity structure of weak interactions ( photon polarization in @xmath12 and other radiative decays , asymmetries in @xmath13 decays ) .",
    "such promising measurements are central to the core physics programme of lhcb ; they have been studied in detail and are described in a recent roadmap document  @xcite .",
    "however , the wider programme will include many more measurements , mostly in ( but not limited to ) the heavy - flavor sector .",
    "the lhcb detector  @xcite is a single - arm spectrometer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lhcb ] left ) covering the forward region ( @xmath14 ) where the @xmath15 production is peaked .",
    "it will rely on relatively soft @xmath16 triggers , efficient for both leptonic @xmath11 decays ( @xmath17 ) and purely hadronic @xmath11 decays ( @xmath18 ) . by design",
    "the luminosity will be limited to an average of @xmath19 in order to avoid a significant fraction of events with more than one @xmath20 inelastic interaction . a nominal year ( @xmath21 ) of running in design conditions",
    "will give an integrated luminosity of @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "however , in the first lhc physics run started on march 30 , 2010 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lhcb ] right ) the centre - of - mass energy is @xmath24 , reducing the expected @xmath15 and @xmath25 production rates by factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , although without dramatic impact on the physics reach .",
    "the nominal instantaneous luminosity is expected to be reached in 2011 , while the current lower luminosity period in 2010 allows for lower trigger thresholds , and hence better efficiencies for hadronic @xmath11 decays ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this represents also a good opportunity to collect rapidly very large samples of charm events , with a corresponding trigger efficiency boosted up from @xmath29 to @xmath18 .",
    "approximately @xmath30 of data have been collected during april and may 2010 , mostly with a fully inclusive trigger requesting at least one reconstructed track in the detector .",
    "since the last week of may , a loose high - level trigger is run in rejection mode to limit the output rate to a few khz .",
    "the overall status of the experiment  @xcite , the data - taking experience  @xcite , and the event reconstruction performance  @xcite obtained from the first data are described elsewhere .",
    "r0.5    the first physics measurements within reach are those of the production of known and most abundantly produced particles .",
    "lhcb is focusing initially on unstable particles which can be reconstructed through their decay into charged tracks , and therefore cleanly identified as narrow signals above some combinatorial background .",
    "so far close to 30 different mass peaks have been seen in the lhcb data , including decays involving neutrals such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "because of the nature of the lhcb core measurements , which will most often rely on fully reconstructed decays , the understanding and modelling of the structure of minimum bias events is not of utmost importance , hence more difficult production measurements of stable particles such as charged pions , kaons , protons or tracks in general are not at the centre of the present effort . of more direct interest",
    "are the production measurements of strange ( and neutral ) , charm , and bottom hadrons , as well as of electroweak bosons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : w ] ) .",
    "production measurements at lhcb are necessarily new since lhc is operating at an unexplored energy . in order to turn them into cross section measurements ,",
    "an estimate of the luminosity is needed .",
    "the principle of a direct determination of the luminosity based on a new ` beam imaging ' technique  @xcite has been demonstrated using the data collected during the lhc pilot run in december 2009  @xcite , and used for the first absolute production cross section measurement described below .",
    "+    strange quarks appear in the hadronization process of soft hadronic interactions , and their production is an excellent probe of the fragmentation field . in particular the measurement of strangeness production in hadronic interactions provides input for the understanding of qcd in the non - perturbative regime and for the tuning of monte carlo generators .",
    "the data collected during the lhc pilot run in december 2009 at @xmath34  tev were used to measure the prompt @xmath35 production as a function of the @xmath35 transverse momentum @xmath16 and rapidity @xmath36 in the region @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vzero ] left ) . at this low beam energy the beam sizes and crossing angle ( induced by the lhcb dipole magnet )",
    "do not allow the complete closure of the vertex locator ( velo ) around the interaction region . as a result",
    "the data were collected with the velo silicon detectors retracted by 15  mm from their nominal position , reducing significantly the azimuthal coverage provided by the velo .",
    "however @xmath39 decays could still efficiently be reconstructed using tracks reconstructed in the tracking stations ( tt and t1t3 ) . on the other hand",
    "the velo was essential to measure @xmath20 and beam - gas interaction vertices , and determine the positions , sizes and angles of the colliding proton bunches .",
    "together with bunch current measurements obtained from the lhc machine instrumentation , this allowed a direct determination of the integrated luminosity ( @xmath40 ) of the sample used for the @xmath35 analysis .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : vzero ] ( left ) , the preliminary measurements of the absolute prompt @xmath35 production cross section are in fair agreement with the expectations from the pythia generator , before any tuning to lhc data .",
    "these results have been finalized and published  @xcite since the conference .",
    "the data collected in 2010 , both at @xmath34  tev and 7  tev , were also used to study @xmath41 production .",
    "we show for the first time at this conference  @xcite preliminary measurements of the @xmath42 production ratio as a function of rapidity @xmath36 for the two centre - of - mass energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vzero ] right ) .",
    "contrary to the results at high energy , the measurements of the @xmath42 ratio at @xmath34  tev are significantly below the expectation and show a strong dependence in rapidity .",
    "such studies are useful to investigate and understand the baryon - number transport from the beams in the more central region of the detector .",
    "clean charm signals reconstructed in the first @xmath43 of data at @xmath44 ( fig .  [ fig : charm ] ) already allow to firm up exciting prospects for measurements of @xmath45 mixing and cp violation in the charm sector  @xcite .",
    "indeed , with @xmath46 the statistics of ( flavour - tagged ) @xmath47 decays are expected to exceed that of the babar experiment by an order of magnitude .",
    "significant contributions from lhcb are expected soon on several mixing - related observables , in particular :    * @xmath48 from the proper - time measurements of untagged @xmath49 and @xmath50 decays ( fig .",
    "[ fig : charm ] top ) ; * @xmath51 from the proper - time measurements of flavour - tagged @xmath50 decays , where the flavour of the @xmath47 meson at production ( @xmath47 or @xmath52 ) is determined from the sign of the charged pion in the reconstructed @xmath53 decay ( fig .",
    "[ fig : charm ] middle left ) ; * mixing parameters related to the mass and decay - width differences in the @xmath45 system , from the time - dependent analysis of wrong - sign flavour - tagged @xmath54 decays ( interference between doubly - cabibbo suppressed decays without mixing and cabibbo - favoured decays with mixing ) .    similarly , huge statistics of charged @xmath55 mesons will allow an unprecedented search for direct cp violation in charm .",
    "the most interesting modes are the singly - cabibbo suppressed decays , governed by gluonic penguin diagrams where new physics may enter .",
    "the three - body mode @xmath56 , together with the two cabibbo - favoured decays @xmath57 and @xmath58 to be used as control channels , offers the interesting possibility of a dalitz plot analysis where local cp asymmetries can be probed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : charm ] middle right and bottom ) .",
    "bottom production can easily be observed with a few @xmath61 of data , if inclusive selections are used .",
    "two approaches are described here , which will soon yield the first measurements of the @xmath15 production cross section at @xmath44 .",
    "an important part of lhcb s physics programme is based on the selection of @xmath62 decays , which leave a clear signature in the detector and which can efficiently be recognized both at the trigger level and in the offline analysis . at the present level of understanding of the detector alignment and calibration , and using a very loose trigger ,",
    "a signal of @xmath63 events per @xmath61 is obtained , with a mass resolution of @xmath64 and a signal - to - background ratio of 0.8 in a @xmath65 window around the central value of the mass peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsi ] left ) .",
    "this abundant signal will be an important tool to further understand and improve the reconstruction performance .",
    "the two main sources of @xmath66 mesons , prompt production at the @xmath20 interaction vertex and secondary production in @xmath2-hadron decays , can be separated by measuring the pseudo - proper time @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the reconstructed positions of the @xmath66 decay and of the @xmath20 interaction point along the beam direction ( @xmath70 axis ) , @xmath71 is the nominal @xmath66 mass , and @xmath72 the @xmath70 component of the reconstructed @xmath66 momentum .",
    "the distribution of @xmath73 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsi ] ( right ) for @xmath66 candidates with reconstructed masses in the signal and sideband regions",
    ". the @xmath74 component of the signal is clearly visible as an exponential tail in the positive @xmath73 region .",
    "a similar analysis is performed by selecting @xmath75 decays and using the distribution of the @xmath47 impact parameter ( ip ) with respect to the primary vertex to extract the @xmath2 component .",
    "a yield of @xmath76 events is obtained in @xmath77 , which the largest @xmath2-hadron signal observed so far in lhcb . in order to increase the purity an identified muon track is required in association with the @xmath47 .",
    "if the @xmath78 combination comes from a semileptonic @xmath79 decay , the muon and the kaon from the @xmath47 must have equal charges ( ` right - sign ' combination ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dzeromu ] shows the distributions of the @xmath47 mass and of the ip logarithm for both the right - sign and wrong - sign samples .",
    "prompt @xmath47 production ( associated with a random muon ) contributes equally to both samples with small ip values , while semileptonic @xmath2-hadron decays contribute with larger ip values only to the right - sign sample . in the latter",
    "a clean and significant ( @xmath80 ) signal of @xmath81 @xmath2 events is extracted from a fit of the @xmath82 distribution , where the shape of the @xmath2 ( prompt ) component is fixed from mc ( data without the muon requirement ) .",
    "these results have been finalized  @xcite since the conference .    in the future",
    "the abundant signals of semileptonic @xmath83 and @xmath84 decays are expected to play a major role in the study of cp violation in @xmath85 and @xmath86 mixing : monte carlo studies indicate that a measurement competitive with the tevatron results can be obtained with less than @xmath87 of data , which is the statistics expected by the end of 2011 .",
    "while several fully reconstructed @xmath11 candidates have already been selected , the first significant mass peak has been seen by combining the @xmath88 and @xmath89 modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bexcl ] ) . a @xmath90 signal as well as",
    "@xmath91 cabibbo - suppressed signals are expected soon .",
    "the main physics goal with such hadronic @xmath11 decays is the determination of the ckm angle @xmath3 using the interference between @xmath92 and @xmath8 tree - level diagrams in @xmath93 decays , where a statistical precision of @xmath94  degrees ( three times better than the current knowledge from the @xmath11 factories ) is expected with @xmath87 of data  @xcite .",
    "the current data already allow lhcb to prepare for a few key @xmath86 analyses . amongst those",
    ", the measurement of mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath95 decays and the search for the very rare @xmath96 decay based on the first @xmath97 of data are expected to compete with tevatron results , and may reveal hints of new physics with @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "lhcb is taking data with success .",
    "first strangeness production measurements have been performed , and clean charm and bottom signals have been reconstructed .",
