    "one such class of observables is that of _ event shapes _ , numbers that depend on the distrbution of momenta of final state hadrons , probing in greater detail the structure of the jets than does the total hadronic or @xmath4-jet cross section .",
    "the study of @xmath0 event shapes has a long history in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd).@xcite a two - jet event shape @xmath5 is defined to range between 0 and 1 , with exactly back - to - back pencil - like jets corresponding to @xmath6 . predicting the distribution of events near the region @xmath6 requires both perturbative resummation as well as an accounting of nonperturbative power corrections , which enter as powers of @xmath7 due to nonperturbative soft or collinear radiation from jets .",
    "many approaches have led to fruitful analysis of these power corrections , mostly based on the behavior of perturbation theory predictions for event shape distributions .",
    "renormalon ambiguities of order @xmath8 in the perturbative series for jet observables led to the prediction of compensating @xmath8 nonperturbative power corrections.@xcite these studies led to models of a universal effective or dispersive infrared coupling replacing the strong coupling at low scales implying universal power corrections to different event shapes,@xcite and later to the model of _ dressed gluon exponentiation _",

    "however , a comparison of the treatments in scet and full qcd has not only elucidated tight connections between the two approaches , but has also inspired proofs of the universal relations among power corrections to different event shapes which go beyond some of the assumptions implicit in the pqcd - based models.@xcite we review these developments in sec .  5 , and conclude in sec .",

    "if the two - point correlations of energy flow @xmath225 are negligible for rapidities @xmath226 , then the coefficient of the matrix element in ( [ 2pointintegral ] ) can be expanded about @xmath227 , @xmath228 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{3}[(1-a){\\left\\lvert \\eta\\right\\rvert}]^3+\\cdots\\right\\}{\\langle\\!\\langle \\mathcal{e}_t(0)\\mathcal{e}_t(\\eta ) \\rangle\\!\\rangle}.\\ ] ] thus the @xmath32-independence of @xmath229",
    "is tied to the assumption of negligible correlations in energy flow of soft radiation.@xcite    the violation of the scaling rule ( [ scalingrule ] ) can itself be used to deduce information about the correlations in the final state soft radiation .",
    "the quantity , @xmath230 is essentially a laplace transform of the two - point correlator to the variable @xmath32 .",
    "equation  ( [ 2pointintegral ] ) relates @xmath231 to the quantity @xmath229 : @xmath232 whose solution is @xmath233 assuming the correlator vanishes for @xmath234 .",
    "thus , the observation of @xmath32-dependence in the coefficient @xmath229 in the expansion of the angularity shape function ( [ angularityexponentiated ] ) yields direct information on correlations of the energy flow of soft radiation at separated rapidities .",
    "this information can , in principle , be extracted from data in @xmath0 collisions at lep .",
    "event shapes provide a useful laboratory for the study of perturbative and nonperturbative properties of hadronic jets .",
    "the continuous adjustable parameter @xmath32 in the angularities provides an extra source of information about the nature of the hadronization process in jet formation .",
    "soft - collinear effective theory provides an organized framework in which to understand factorization , running , and power corrections that have traditionally been described in the language of full qcd .",
    "in particular , the decoupling of collinear and usoft modes in the leading - order lagrangian facilitates factorization , and the form of the soft function and its boost properties lead to a proof of the universality of power corrections to the mean values of event shapes , as well as the extraction of useful information from the violation of universality or scaling of power corrections to higher moments .",
    "scet systematizes the approximations that lead to useful predictions , and sets up the framework that would allow one to calculate corrections , such as those suppressed by @xmath99 or that come from including operators with more jets in the matching from qcd .",
    "a fuller understanding of power corrections to event shapes in @xmath0 collisions helps point the way to the eventual understanding of jets produced in hadron collisions and the nonperturbative dynamics of qcd .",

    "<S> , we demonstrate factorization of event shape distributions into perturbatively - calculable hard and jet functions and nonperturbative soft functions , and show how the latter contribute universal shifts to the mean values of various event shape distributions . violations of universality in shifts of higher moments can give information on correlations of energy flow in soft radiation . </S>"
