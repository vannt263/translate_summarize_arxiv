    "the theory of fault - tolerant quantum computation defines an important number called the error threshold .",
    "if the physical error rate is less than the threshold value @xmath2 , it is possible to stabilize computation by transforming the quantum circuit into a fault - tolerant form where errors can be detected and eliminated .",
    "however , if the error rate is above the threshold , then errors begin to accumulate , which results in rapid decoherence and renders the output of the computation useless .",
    "the actual value of @xmath2 depends on the error correction scheme and the error model .",
    "unfortunately , this number seems to be rather small for all known schemes .",
    "estimates vary from @xmath3 ( see  @xcite ) to @xmath4 ( see  @xcite ) , which is hardly achievable with the present technology .    in principle",
    ", one can envision a situation in which qubits do not decohere , and a subset of the elementary gates is realized _ exactly _ due to special properties of the physical system .",
    "this scenario could be realized experimentally using spin , electron , or other many - body systems with topologically ordered ground states .",
    "excitations in two - dimensional topologically ordered systems are anyons  quasiparticles with unusual statistics described by non - trivial representations of the braid group .",
    "if we have sufficient control of anyons i.e. , are able to move them around each other , fuse them , and distinguish between different particle types , then we can realize some set of unitary operators and measurements exactly .",
    "this set may or may not be computationally universal .",
    "while the universality can be achieved with sufficiently nontrivial types of anyons  @xcite , more realistic systems offer only decoherence protection and an incomplete set of topological gates .",
    "( see  @xcite about non - abelian anyons in quantum hall systems and  @xcite about topological orders in josephson junction arrays . )",
    "nevertheless , universal computation is possible if we introduce some additional operations ( e.g. , measurements by aharonov - bohm interference  @xcite or some gates that are not related to topology at all ) .",
    "of course , these non - topological operations can not be implemented exactly and thus are prone to errors .    in this situation",
    ", the threshold error rate @xmath2 may become significantly larger than the values given above because we need to correct only errors of certain special type and we introduce a smaller amount of error in the correction stage .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to illustrate this statement by a particular computational model .",
    "the model is built upon the _ clifford group _  the group of unitary operators that map the group of pauli operators to itself under conjugation .",
    "the set of elementary operations is divided into two parts : @xmath5 .",
    "operations from @xmath6 are assumed to be perfect .",
    "we list these operations below :    * prepare a qubit in the state @xmath7 ; * apply unitary operators from the clifford group ; * measure an eigenvalue of a pauli operator ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 ) on any qubit .    here",
    "we mean non - destructive projective measurement .",
    "we also assume that no errors occur between the operations .",
    "it is well - known that these operations are not sufficient for universal quantum computation ( unless a quantum computer can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer ) .",
    "more specifically , the gottesman - knill theorem states that by operations from @xmath6 one can only obtain quantum states of a very special form called _",
    "stabilizer states_. such a state can be specified as an intersection of eigenspaces of pairwise commuting pauli operators , which are referred to as _",
    "stabilizers_. using the stabilizer formalism , one can easily simulate the evolution of the state and the statistics of measurements on a classical probabilistic computer ( see  @xcite or a textbook  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the set @xmath11 describes faulty operations . in our model",
    ", it consists of just one operation :    * prepare an ancillary qubit in a mixed state @xmath1 .",
    "the state @xmath1 should be regarded as a parameter of the model . from the physical point of view",
    ", @xmath1 is mixed due to imperfections of the preparation procedure ( entanglement of the ancilla with the environment , thermal fluctuations , etc . ) .",
    "an essential requirement is that by preparing @xmath12 qubits we obtain the state @xmath13 i.e. , all ancillary qubits are independent .",
    "the independence assumption is similar to the uncorrelated errors model in the standard fault - tolerant computation theory .",
    "our motivation for including all clifford group gates into @xmath6 relies mostly on the recent progress in the fault - tolerant implementation of such gates .",
    "for instance , using a concatenated stabilizer code with good error correcting properties to encode each qubit and applying gates transversally ( so that errors do not propogate inside code blocks ) one can implement clifford gates with an arbitrary high precision , see  @xcite .",
    "however these nearly perfect gates act on _ encoded _ qubits . to establish a correspondence with our model , one needs to prepare an _ encoded _ ancilla in the state @xmath1 .",
    "it can be done using the schemes for fault - tolerant encoding of an arbitrary _ known _ one - qubit state described by knill in  @xcite . in the more recent",
    "paper  @xcite knill constructed a novel scheme of fault - tolerant quantum computation which combines ( i ) the teleported computing and error correction technique by gottesman and chuang  @xcite ; ( ii ) the method of purification of css states by dr and briegel  @xcite ; and ( iii ) the magic states distillation algorithms described in the present paper . as was argued in  @xcite , this scheme is likely to yield much higher value for the threshold @xmath2 ( may be up to @xmath14 ) .",
    "unfortunately , ideal implementation of the clifford group can not be currently achieved in any realistic physical system with a topological order .",
    "what universality classes of anyons allow one to implement all clifford group gates ( but do not allow one to simulate uqc ) is an interesting open problem .    to fully utilize the potential of our model , we allow _ adaptive _ computation .",
    "it means that a description of an operation to be performed at the step @xmath15 may be a function of all measurement outcomes at the steps @xmath16 .",
    "( for even greater generality , the dependence may be probabilistic .",
    "this assumption does not actually strengthen the model since tossing a fair coin can be simulated using @xmath6 . ) at this point , we need to be careful because the proper choice of operations should not only be defined mathematically  it should be computed by some _ efficient algorithm_. in all protocols described below , the algorithms will actually be very simple .",
    "( let us point out that dropping the computational complexity restriction still leaves a non - trivial problem : can we prepare an arbitrary multiqubit pure state with any given fidelity using only operations from the basis @xmath17 ? )    the main question that we address in this paper is as follows : for which density matrices @xmath1 can one efficiently simulate universal quantum computation by adaptive computation in the basis @xmath17 ?",
    "it will be convenient to use the bloch sphere representation of one - qubit states : @xmath18 the vector @xmath19 will be referred to as the _ polarization vector _ of @xmath1 .",

    "we can prepare these states by operations from @xmath25 only .",
    "since @xmath1 is a convex linear combination ( probabilistic mixture ) of these states , we can prepare @xmath1 by operations from @xmath6 and by tossing a coin with suitable weights .",

    "these properties of the clifford group allow us to introduce a very useful computational procedure which can be realized by operations from @xmath6 .",

    "it is clear that we can defer all clifford operations until the very end if we replace the pauli measurements by general syndrome measurements .",
    "thus the most general transformation that can be realized by @xmath6 is an _ adaptive syndrome measurement _ , meaning that the choice of the stabilizer @xmath87 to be measured next depends on the previously measured values of @xmath88 . in general",

    ", we distill one copy of the magic state @xmath423 with the final error probability @xmath494 where @xmath272 is the number of recursion levels ( here we neglect the fluctuations in the number of successful distillation attempts ) . solving these equation",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath495 it characterizes the efficiency of the distillation scheme .",
    "we have studied a simplified model of fault - tolerant quantum computation in which operations from the clifford group are realized exactly , whereas decoherence occurs only during the preparation of nontrivial ancillary states .",
    "the model is fully characterized by a one - qubit density matrix @xmath1 describing these states .",
    "it is shown that a good strategy for simulating universal quantum computation in this model is `` magic states distillation '' . by constructing two particular distillation schemes",
    "we find a threshold polarization of @xmath1 above which the simulation is possible .",
    "the most exciting open problem is to understand the computational power of the model in the region of parameters @xmath496 ( which corresponds to @xmath497 , see section  [ sec : intro ] ) . in this region ,",
    "the distillation scheme based on the 5-quit code does not work , while the gottesman - knill theorem does not yet allow the classical simulation .",

    "one it suffices to construct a @xmath28-type states distillation scheme having the threshold fidelity @xmath55 .",
    "a systematic way of constructing such schemes is to replace the 5-qubit by a @xmath499-linear stabilizer code .",
    "a nice property of these codes is that the bitwise application of the operator @xmath28 preserves the code subspace and acts on the encoded qubit as @xmath28 , see  @xcite for more details .",
    "one can check that the error - correcting effect described in sec .",
    "[ sec : t ] takes place for an arbitrary @xmath499-linear stabilizer code , provided that the number of qubits is @xmath500 for any integer @xmath272 .",
    "unfortunately , numerical simulations we performed for some codes with @xmath501 and @xmath502 indicate that the threshold fidelity increases as the number of qubits increases .",
    "so it may well be the case that the 5-qubit code is the best @xmath499-linear code as far as the distillation is concerned .    from the experimental point of view ,",
    "an exciting open problem is to design a physical system in which reliable storage of quantum information and its processing by clifford group operations is possible .",
    "since our simulation scheme tolerates strong decoherence on the ancilla preparation stage , such a system would be a good candidate for a practical quantum computer .",
