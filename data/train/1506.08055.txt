    "in this modern era , it is strongly believed that we are living in an accelerating universe .",
    "it has been established through different observations like ia supernova @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy from planck @xcite , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , large scale structures ( lss ) @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "these observations have also pointed out that the universe is dominated by some kind of exotic matter , known as dark energy @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that the dark energy was responsible to produce sufficient acceleration in late time evolution of the universe .",
    "thus , it is much more essential to study the fundamental nature of the dark energy , and several attempts have been made to understand it .",
    "the cosmological constant is assumed to be the simplest candidate of dark energy .",
    "it is the classical correction made to the einstein s field equations by adding cosmological constant to the field equations .",
    "the introduction of cosmological constant to einstein s field equations is the most efficient way of generating accelerated expansion .",
    "later it faces serious problems like fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence problems in cosmology @xcite .",
    "there are also other claimants of dark energy like quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyons @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite",
    ". however , there is no direct detection of such exotic fluids .",
    "quintessence is considered as the fifth element of the universe along with four other elements namely baryons , radiations , dark matter and neutrinos .",
    "the name `` quintessence '' has been introduced by caldwell et al . @xcite .",
    "the quintessence field arises from lagrangian , which is motivated by relativistic continuum mechanics .",
    "it is assumed that the equation of state for quintessence is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energy density and pressure respectively .",
    "research indicates that observational constraint in the equation of state of dark energy suggests @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the phantom is one of the candidature of dark energy , which is a scalar field with negative kinetic energy . in this case",
    ", the equation state parameter satisfies the condition @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is known that for @xmath11 , the dark energy ( phantom ) will violate all energy conditions @xcite . still",
    ", such type of models @xcite are consistent with observational data @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in case of phantom model , the universe will end with a big rip . in other words , for a phantom dominated universe , its total life time is finite @xcite .",
    "k - essence is a simple way for constructing an accelerated expansion model of the universe .",
    "it is exclusively based on the idea that the unknown dark energy component is due to a minimally coupled scalar field with non - canonical kinetic energy which results in the negative pressure and provides k - essence cosmological model @xcite .",
    "tachyon is also another candidature for dark energy .",
    "such type of models are based on scalar field .",
    "the tachyon dark energy has an equation of state parameter between 1 and 0 .",
    "the tachyon is an unstable field , which has become important in the string theory through its role in the dirac - born - infield action , which is used to describe the d - brane action @xcite .",
    "chaplygin gas is also one of the prominent candidature of dark energy .",
    "it is a perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a positive constant .",
    "this equation of state has been introduced by chaplygin @xcite as a suitable mathematical approximation for calculating the lifting force on a wing of an airplane in aerodynamics @xcite .",
    "modification is made to the equation of state of chapligin gas and it has been named as generalized chapligin gas , modified chapligin gas etc . due to the absence of strong evidence of existence about the dark energy , many researchers are interested in exploring the dark energy .",
    "bamba et al.@xcite have studied the number of dark energy models like @xmath15cdm model , little rip and pseudo - rip scenarios , the phantom and quintessence cosmologies with the four types ( i , ii , iii and iv ) of the finite - time future singularities and non - singular universes filled with dark energy .",
    "one possible way of exploring dark energy is to modify the geometric part of the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "based on its modifications , several alternative theories of gravity came into existence . some of the modified theories of gravity are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath0 gravity .",
    "these models were proposed to explore the dark energy and other cosmological problems .",
    "the @xmath16 modified theory produces both cosmic inflation and mimic behavior of dark energy including present cosmic acceleration @xcite .",

    "jamil et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed reconstruction of some cosmological models in @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "scalar field cosmology plays a crucial role in the study of the early universe , particularly in the investigation of inflation @xcite .",
    "it acts as the most natural basis for the inflationary cosmology .",
    "thus , scalar field cosmology gained popularity among researchers .",
    "research suggests that most of the studies have been carried out with a minimally coupled scalar field representing quintessence .",
    "ellis and madsen @xcite have studied the frw model with a minimally coupled scalar field along with a potential and a perfect fluid in the form of radiation .",
    "barrow and saich @xcite have studied the class of exact isotropic cosmological models containing perfect fluids and scalar fields with nonzero potentials and discussed the conditions under which inflation can occur and when the scalar field source dominates the late stages of the expansion of the universe .",
    "non - minimally coupled scalar field cosmological models have been discussed by barrow and mimoso @xcite and mimoso and wands @xcite .",
    "cosmological models involving perfect fluid and scalar field with an exponential potential have been thoroughly analysed @xcite .",

    "also perfect fluid form of energy momentum tensor is considered here .",
    "singh and bishi @xcite have invested the first and second class of of @xmath20 gravity for the anisotropic bianchi type - i space time .",

    "they have explored the first type of @xmath0 gravity in presence of wet dark fluid for five dimensional kaluza - klein space time and also used expansion law ( polynomial and exponential ) to solve the modified einstein s field equations .",
    "bianchi type @xmath21 cosmological model for the first type of @xmath0 gravity is analysed by the same authors @xcite .",

    "sahoo et al .",

    "the variation law of mean hubble parameter is used to obtain the exact solutions of modified einstein s field equations and some physical and kinematical properties of the model are also discussed .",
    "it is hoped that the articles @xcite and other discussed articles in the above contributes to the investigation of @xmath0 gravity , which is useful for the astrophysicists and cosmologists of the different corner of the world .",
    "motivated by the above mentioned research , in this present article we have investigated the first form of @xmath0 gravity for lrs bianchi type - i space time in presence of scalar field and cosmological constant .",
    "constant scalar potential and exponential scalar potential with expansion law ( polynomial and exponential ) is used to obtain the exact solution of the modified einstein s field equations . the main difference between the past articles @xcite and",
    "this article is that they differ from each other in terms of matter source and the solution procedure to obtain the exact solution of the field equations .",

    "harko et al.@xcite presented three classes of these models as follows @xmath46 in this paper , let us assume the simplest form of @xmath47 as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a function of cosmic time and @xmath48 is the gravitational interaction between matter and curvature .",
