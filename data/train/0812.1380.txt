    "[ [ 1.1 ] ]    mating of polynomials is a construction invented by a. douady and j.h .",
    "hubbard in the 1980 s , soon after their seminal work on the structure of the mandelbrot set for quadratic polynomials ( @xcite ) .",
    "the construction is of a rational map @xmath0 from any two given critically finite quadratic polynomials @xmath1 and @xmath2 , apart from some restrictions on @xmath3 which are ( with hindsight ) very natural and simple .",
    "the construction suggests that the intricacy of structure of the parameter space of quadratic polynomials is , at the very least , reproduced in the parameter space of rational maps .",
    "given that the coordinates of a mating are polynomials , one might expect a product structure of some sort in the space of rational maps .",
    "it has been known for some time ( from unpublished work of adam epstein ) that this can not be true in any strong topological sense .",
    "but the way in which the structure translates to the parameter space of rational maps is even more interesting than might at first appear .",
    "this has been one aspect of an extensive study .",
    "see , for example @xcite . in the current work ,",
    "we avoid direct reference to such theory , and present some examples .",
    "the construction of these examples is self - contained , although they were found during a larger exploration of the theory .",
    "we show that , even if we restrict to a single choice of @xmath1 , the so - called aeroplane polynomial , the map @xmath4 is unboundedly many - to - one . thus , a critically finite quadratic rational map can be realised as a mating of the aeroplane polynomial with another polynomial in arbitrarily many ways .",
    "we also obtain a similar result for _ captures_. the capture construction probably first appears in written form in wittner s 1988 thesis @xcite , but was studied by the hubbard group earlier in the 1980 s .",
    "( the term , `` capture '' is used here in a more restrictive sense than is sometimes the case .",
    "the precise definition will be given later . )",
    "the capture @xmath5 is a critically finite quadratic rational map made from a critically finite quadratic polynomial @xmath6 and a path @xmath7 from the fixed critical point @xmath8 of @xmath6 , which crosses the julia set of @xmath6 just once , at a point @xmath9 in the boundary of a preperiodic fatou component , and ends at the precritical point in that fatou component . as in the case of the mating construction , there are some extra , natural and easily stated restrictions .",
    "one of the constant refrains of @xcite is that `` type iii '' maps , of which captures are examples , are technically easier to work with than `` type iv '' maps , of which matings are examples .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that the mating result is essentially obtained from the capture result .",
    "the way in which this is done is reminiscent of argument in @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult and may indicate that more general theoretical results can be obtained in the same way .",
    "i should like to thank the referee for full and prompt engagement with the paper , and for some helpful comments .",
    "we use the notation and conventions of @xcite .",
    "this means , in particular , that we work with the lamination map which is thurston equivalent to the aeroplane polynomial , rather than with the aeroplane polynomial itself .",
    "we call this lamination map @xmath10 .",
    "it preserves the unit disc , unit circle and exterior of the unit disc . on the exterior of the unit disc , @xmath11 , and on the interior of the unit disc @xmath10",
    "preserves a lamination known as @xmath12 , and also preserves the set of complementary components of @xmath13 in the unit disc .",
    "this lamination is an example of a _",
    "quadratic invariant lamination_. it is a closed set of disjoint chords , or _ leaves _",
    ", in the unit disc .",
    "_ invariance _ of a lamination @xmath14 in the unit disc means that :    * whenever there is a leaf of @xmath14 joining @xmath15 and @xmath16 , there is also a leaf of @xmath14 joining @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; * whenever there is a chord joining @xmath15 and @xmath16 , there are points @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and such that there are leaves of @xmath14 joining @xmath23 to @xmath24 , and @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "the label @xmath27 on @xmath12 means that the ( common ) image of the two longest leaves of @xmath12 has one endpoint at @xmath28 .",
    "this image is known as the _ minor leaf _ of @xmath12 .",
    "the other endpoint of the minor leaf is at @xmath29 . in what follows ,",
    "we only consider invariant laminations in which every leaf has exactly two preimages .",
    "such an invariant lamination is uniquely determined by its minor leaf .",
    "we therefore write @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the minor leaf is periodic under @xmath10 , of period @xmath32 .",
    "it is adjacent to a unique complementary component of @xmath33 in the unit disc , also known as a _ gap _ of @xmath33 , which is also of period three .",
    "the gap adjacent to the minor leaf has a connected preimage under @xmath10 .",
    "this connected preimage contains @xmath34 and is known as the _ critical gap _ , since it maps with degree two onto its image .",
    "it then maps homeomorphically on the rest of the cycle , and returns to itself under @xmath35 with degree two .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath10 having a unique critical point in the unit disc at @xmath34 , and this critical point being of period @xmath32 .",
    "we choose @xmath10 like this .",
    "more generally , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are uniquely determined in the same way , for any odd denominator rational @xmath38 in @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath37 is a critically periodic branched covering , with one fixed critical point ( at @xmath8 ) , and one periodic critical point of the same period as the period of @xmath38 under @xmath40 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between such maps @xmath37 and critically periodic polynomials in the family @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) , where the correspondence is defined by _",
    "thurston equivalence_. in this paper , two critically finite branched coverings @xmath43 and @xmath1 with numbered postcritical sets are _",
    "( thurston ) equivalent _ if there is a homotopy through critically finite branched coverings @xmath44 such that the postcritical set @xmath45 moves isotopically and the numbering of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is preserved by this isotopy .",
    "the stipulation that numbering is preserved is not universal , but is convenient here , especially when we consider matings . for quadratic branched coverings with a fixed critical point it is superfluous , because a fixed critical point moves isotopically through fixed critical points .",
    "the _ aeroplane polynomial _ is the ( unique ) quadratic polynomial of the form @xmath41 which is thurston equivalent to @xmath10.the critical point @xmath34 is of period @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter value @xmath48 is real and in @xmath49 , and is the unique such value for which @xmath34 is of period @xmath32 .      for any path @xmath50",
    ", we define a homeomorphism @xmath51 , up to isotopy of a suitable type .",
    "the definition can be made for any path , but since we only need the definition for paths which are arcs , we only give the definition for these .",
    "this homeomorphism @xmath51 is the identity outside a suitably small disc neighbourhood of @xmath50 , and maps the startpoint of @xmath50 to the endpoint , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "a _ capture path for @xmath37 _ is a path from @xmath8 to a nonperiodic point @xmath9 in the backward orbit of the ( periodic ) point @xmath34 which crosses the unit circle just once , into a gap of @xmath36 and ending at @xmath9 , with no intersections with @xmath36 .",
    "a _ capture by @xmath37 _ is then a branched covering of the form @xmath52 for a capture path @xmath50 .",
    "such a branched covering is critically finite , with critical points at @xmath34 and @xmath8 and critical values at @xmath53 and @xmath9 , the endpoint of @xmath50 . then @xmath34 is periodic under @xmath52 , and the critical point @xmath9 is eventually mapped by @xmath52 to the periodic orbit of @xmath34",
    "we refer to such a degree two branched covering , with one critical point periodic , and the other nonperiodic , but in the backward orbit of the first , as being _ of type iii_.    in this paper , we only consider captures by @xmath10 , which , up to equivalence , are _ captures by the aeroplane polynomial _ , since they can equally well be described ( up to equivalence ) by capture paths in the dynamical plane of the aeroplane polynomial , that is , paths which cross the julia set of the aeroplane polynomial just once . by the result of tan lei , or",
    "at least the technique of it ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) a capture @xmath54 is thurston equivalent to a quadratic rational map ( which is unique up to mbius conjugation ) if and only if the endpoint @xmath9 of the path is a point in the full orbit of @xmath34 which is in the larger region of the unit disc bounded by the leaf of @xmath12 with endpoints at @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the crossing point by the capture path of the unit circle is at @xmath56 for @xmath57 . in section 2.8 of @xcite ,",
    "elementary equivalences between different captures by @xmath10 were discussed , for capture paths with the same endpoint .",
    "it was shown that any two captures @xmath58 and @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 have the same endpoint , are thurston equivalent , except when the common endpoint of the paths is in the region of the unit disc bounded between the leaves with endpoints @xmath55 , and endpoints @xmath62 .",
    "in the exceptional case , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are still thurston equivalent if @xmath60 and @xmath61 have the same endpoint , and if the @xmath63-crossing points @xmath64 and @xmath65 are such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both in @xmath68 , or both in @xmath69 .",
    "an example was given in 9.2 of @xcite of capture paths @xmath60 and @xmath61 with different endpoints , with crossing points @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , such that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are thurston equivalent .",
    "it was also shown in the `` easy '' main theorem of @xcite ( 2.10 and 6.1 ) that captures with different endpoints are not thurston equivalent except when the endpoints are in the region bounded by the leaves joining @xmath55 and @xmath72 .",
    "( this is essentially a folklore result if the crossing point @xmath56 satisfies @xmath73 , but not so if @xmath74 . )",
    "a detailed analysis of the _ parameter capture map _ for the aeroplane polynomial @xmath75 \\mapsto [ \\sigma _ { \\beta } \\circ s_{3/7}]\\ ] ]  where @xmath76 $ ] on the domain is suitable homotopy equivalence , and @xmath76 $ ] and on the range is thurston equivalence  will be given in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is simply to give examples to show that the fibres of this capture map  that is , the sets of equivalent captures  can be arbitrarily large .",
    "we also describe matings only up to thurston equivalence . for ( quadratic ) lamination maps @xmath37 and @xmath77 , the _ mating _ @xmath78 of @xmath37 and @xmath77 is the branched covering defined by @xmath79 we are only considering , here , the case of @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from tan lei s theorem ( @xcite ) that @xmath81 is thurston equivalent to a quadratic rational map ( unique up to mbius conjugacy ) if and only if @xmath82 . as in the case of captures",
    ", it is essentially a folklore result that , for @xmath83 , branched coverings @xmath84 and @xmath85 are thurston equivalent if and only if @xmath86 , that is , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are endpoints of the same minor leaf ( so that @xmath89 ) .",
    "it is likely that the corresponding result for @xmath90 is true , and can be proved from the analogous result for captures .",
    "it is hoped to include a proof of this in another paper in the near future . for @xmath91 ,",
    "this is far from true , as the result of this paper shows .",
    "there is a way of describing lamination maps @xmath77 and matings up to thurston equivalence using homeomorphisms @xmath51 , which has been used in @xcite and @xcite and which will be useful here , too .",
    "first we describe @xmath77 up to thurston equivalence , for any odd denominator rational @xmath92 in @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the map @xmath95 .",
    "suppose that @xmath96 has period @xmath97 under @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath50 be an arc from @xmath34 to a point near @xmath96 which does not intersect the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath98 be a similar path from @xmath34 to @xmath99 , which is in a small neighbourhood of @xmath100 .",
    "then the thurston equivalence class of @xmath101 is uniquely determined , assuming that sufficiently small neighbourhoods were chosen .",
    "we can choose @xmath50 to intersect the minor leaf of @xmath102 exactly once , and @xmath98 so as not to intersect @xmath103 at all .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath104 preserves @xmath102 up to isotopy , and is thurston equivalent to @xmath77 .    for the similar description of matings , we can describe @xmath78 as follows , again assuming that @xmath105 is of period @xmath97 under @xmath94 .",
    "we take @xmath50 to be a path from @xmath8 to a small neighbourhood of @xmath106 ( not @xmath105 , because the identification with the unit disc is by @xmath107 ) which does not cross the unit circle , and let @xmath98 a path from @xmath8 to a small neighbourhood of @xmath108 which is in a small neighbourhood of @xmath109 .",
    "then @xmath110 is thurston equivalent to @xmath78 .",
    "we shall prove the following .",
    "* there is a pair of equivalent captures by the aeroplane polynomial with the nonperiodic critical point of preperiod @xmath111 , such that the capture paths have distinct endpoints , but the @xmath63-crossing points of the capture paths are both in @xmath112 .",

    "let @xmath176 be the simple loop based at @xmath139 , which crosses out of the gap containing @xmath139 on the upper unit circle , then crosses back to trace round @xmath172 in an anti - clockwise direction , crosses out on the upper boundary of the unit circle and then back across the upper unit circle into the gap containing @xmath139 and then ends at @xmath139 .",

    "of course , thurston equivalence is an equivalence relation , while @xmath185 is not .",
    "nevertheless this notation gives useful information .",
    "similarly to @xcite , ( 3.3 , 6.3 or 8.1 ) we can define @xmath189 by induction on @xmath190 , setting @xmath191 to be the identity .",
    "then we define @xmath192 in terms of @xmath189 for @xmath181 by @xmath193 together with the property that @xmath192 is isotopic to @xmath189 via an isotopy which is the identity on @xmath194 , which contains @xmath195 .",
    "it is then also true that @xmath189 and @xmath192 are isotopic via an isotopy which is the identity on @xmath188 .",
    "defining @xmath196 by @xmath197 we have @xmath198 and , for @xmath181 , @xmath199 we then have @xmath200 we need @xmath189 for @xmath190 equal to the preperiod of @xmath171 ( so @xmath201 in this case , which is also the preperiod of @xmath9 ) , up to isotopy preserving @xmath202 .",
    "for such an @xmath190 , we write @xmath203 .",
    "now each @xmath204 is a composition of disc- exchanging involutions .",
    "we see this first for @xmath205 , which is a single involution whose support is an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of @xmath206 that is , approximately the union of @xmath207 and the diagonal in the exterior of the unit disc connecting these .",
    "the involution interchanges the components of @xmath207  tracing a path halfway round the boundary of the supporting disc in a _ clockwise _ direction .",
    "this ensures that @xmath208 exchanges discs , tracing a path halfway round the boundary of the supporting disc in an _ anticlockwise _ direction .",
    "similarly we have @xmath209 we only need to consider the components of the support of @xmath204 which intersect @xmath210 .",
    "note that the support of @xmath211 does not intersect @xmath176 , although it does intersect @xmath212 near @xmath8 .",
    "we shall see inductively that , for all @xmath213 , the components of @xmath204 which intersect @xmath210 do not intersect @xmath214 , but do intersect @xmath215 .",
    "so we have @xmath216 and for @xmath213 , @xmath217 we can describe the involutions using the symbolic dynamics . the involution of @xmath211 is described by @xmath218    the support of @xmath211 thus contains just the points @xmath219 and @xmath220 in @xmath215 and @xmath210 respectively .",
    "we have the following components in the support of @xmath204 for @xmath221 . in each case , two discs @xmath222 and @xmath223 are connected by an arc in the exterior of the unit disc .",
    "the labels `` top '' and `` bot '' indicate whether the arc joins onto the disc @xmath224 on the upper or lower half of the unit circle .",
    "we then only need to consider the components of the support of @xmath204 which intersect @xmath210 .",
    "now @xmath169 is the only point in @xmath172 in the forward orbit of @xmath171 ( and @xmath9 ) , and it turns out that a single component of the support of @xmath204 contains the points in the backward orbit of both @xmath9 and @xmath171 which map forward under @xmath225 to @xmath160 . for @xmath226 ,",
    "the action of @xmath204 is represented by : @xmath227 @xmath228 @xmath229 @xmath230 @xmath231 @xmath232 and finally , for @xmath233 : @xmath234    the support of this last component contains both @xmath9 and @xmath171 , and interchanges them .",
    "define the path @xmath235 by @xmath236 where @xmath237 denotes the usual composition of paths .",
    "so the endpoints of @xmath235 are @xmath139 and @xmath171 .",
    "we may take this as a pointwise definition of @xmath235 , but we are only interested in @xmath235 up to homotopy preserving @xmath210 and @xmath238 .",
    "up to such a homotopy , the path @xmath235 is an arc which crosses out of the gap containing @xmath139 across the upper unit circle then into the gap containing @xmath171 , again across the upper unit circle , and ends at @xmath171 .",
    "then we write @xmath239 then @xmath240    none of the involutions in the support of @xmath241 intersects @xmath235 , except for the one in the support of @xmath242 which interchanges the discs @xmath167 and @xmath166 , with connecting arc along the lower unit circle .",
    "so the endpoints of @xmath243 are @xmath139 and @xmath9 . because this disc exchange ( like all of them ) is in a clockwise direction , @xmath244 passes to the left of @xmath166 , while @xmath176 passes to the right of @xmath245 where @xmath246 is defined by @xmath247 .",
    "however @xmath248 .",
    "note that when discs are exchanged , upper boundaries go to upper boundaries , and lower boundaries to lower .",
    "so @xmath244 hooks round @xmath249 , but @xmath250  because @xmath251 .",
    "so @xmath252 and @xmath253      write @xmath254 it is clear that the pair @xmath255 plays a key role in [ 2.1 ] .",

    "the words @xmath161 and @xmath162 contain only the letters @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and @xmath163 contains only the letters @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 apart from the last letter @xmath121 .",
    "* we have @xmath257 and @xmath163 is the only suffix @xmath160 of @xmath258 which satisfies @xmath259 and @xmath260 is obtained from @xmath258 by changing the word @xmath261 preceding @xmath163 in @xmath258 to @xmath262 .",
    "these are essentially the only properties of @xmath163 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 which are used in the proof of [ 2.1 ] .",

    "this is true , because all the upward pointing hooks are round subsets of @xmath403 where ( as in [ 2.1 ] ) @xmath404 is to the right of @xmath172 , and @xmath405 by [ 2.6 ] .",
    "therefore @xmath406 .",

    "the next exchange  the inverse image of the first one affecting @xmath235  is along the lower unit circle and reduces the size of this hook , replacing it by one of the same shape . as in [ 2.7 ] , and as for @xmath491 , the disc exchanges which affect @xmath492 then alternate between a group of exchanges on the upper and lower unit circle . finally , for @xmath493",
