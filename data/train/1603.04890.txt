    "the vacuum fluctuations of a relativistic quantum field in spacelike separated regions are quantum correlated .",
    "this is referred to as vacuum entanglement .",
    "it has been predicted in the context of accelerating frames of reference  @xcite , as well as in algebraic quantum field theory  @xcite . in  @xcite , it has been shown how entanglement can be extracted from the vacuum state of a quantum field using a pair of initially unentangled two - level atoms , known as unruh - dewitt detectors , which interact only locally with the field .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this scenario was later performed in  @xcite . moreover , a feasible method for detecting vacuum entanglement was proposed in a chain of trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "such entanglement is believed to persist between arbitrarily far away regions of bosonic and fermionic fields  @xcite , and it manifests in the unruh effect for accelerating observers  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , a thorough analysis of vacuum entanglement was performed for massive fields  @xcite , where sudden death of vacuum entanglement as a function of the distance between the modes was observed .",
    "it has also been shown that vacuum entanglement can be used to violate bell s inequalities  @xcite , can be multipartite  @xcite , and that for massless fields , it persists between timelike separated regions  @xcite .",
    "it can also be resonantly enhanced with the use of a moving cavity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the phenomenon is expected to be sensitive to spacetime curvature  @xcite and to have a relevant effect on the possibility of building ideal relativistic clocks @xcite .    in this paper , we generalize one of the recent operational methods for investigating vacuum entanglement  @xcite to nonvacuum gaussian states . in algebraic quantum field theory",
    ", it has been stressed that essentially all field states possess the aforementioned spatial entanglement properties  @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , states other than the vacuum state and the thermal state  @xcite have not yet been explored in the operational approach . in particular , it is not known whether nonclassical states , such as squeezed states , offer any experimental advantage . also , it is not clear how the entanglement between spatial areas and the entanglement in the global basis of plane waves or standing waves are related to each other .    in this paper , we address the above questions . specifically , we consider coherent states , single - mode squeezed thermal states , and two - mode squeezed vacuum states . we show that spatial entanglement is indeed not unique to vacuum .",
    "moreover , we provide examples of states for which the effect is stronger and hence easier to detect .",
    "we also observe that the amount of entanglement in the usual standing wave basis can contribute to the amount of spatial entanglement .    in our operational approach ,",
    "an optical cavity is split into two smaller cavities via rapid introduction of a mirror in between the two mirrors of the cavity .",
    "we show that particle production due to such a change of boundary conditions can be made stronger by using a nonvacuum initial state of the field inside the cavity .",

    "the cavity contains a massless scalar field in an initial gaussian state .",
    "first , we calculate the state of the field after the mirror was introduced .",
    "this way we are able to investigate the mean number of particles produced due to introduction of the mirror .",
    "moreover , we analyze the amount of entanglement between different modes of the two smaller cavities as a function of the initial state of the field .    to show the correspondence between entanglement of particles created in this model and vacuum entanglement , we recall an extended scheme due to brown _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in this scheme",
    "two mirrors are simultaneously introduced a finite distance apart , and it is found that particles created by one mirror are entangled with those created by the other .",
    "since the particle creation events are spacelike separated , one argues that the obtained amount of entanglement must have been present in the initial state of the field . in this paper , we use this scheme , but in a limit where distance between the two mirrors approaches zero . nevertheless , we can retain the interpretation of extracting entanglement from the initial state rather than creating  it .      consider a one - dimensional cavity with a massless scalar field , described by the klein - gordon equation : @xmath4 and dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath5 for all @xmath6 . at @xmath7 ,",
    "an additional mirror is introduced at @xmath8 , which corresponds to the condition @xmath9 for @xmath10 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we will assume @xmath11 , in this section ; however , we review the transformation procedure for arbitrary @xmath12 $ ] as given in  @xcite .",
    "we introduce two families of solutions of the klein - gordon equation  .",
    "the first family , @xmath13 , physically corresponds to the standing waves before the mirror is inserted .",
    "the second family of solutions are @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "these are the standing waves contained within the left cavity and within the right cavity after the division , respectively .",
    "they read as    [ eq : u_l ] @xmath16    and    [ eq : u_n ] @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the heaviside step function .",
    "having introduced the two families of solutions , we can relate them by a bogoliubov transformation :    [ eq : bogotrans ] @xmath19    the coefficients @xmath20 are given by klein - gordon scalar products  @xcite of solutions @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , i.e. , the overlaps of the mode functions corresponding to input states with the mode functions associated with the output states . to calculate these overlaps , we need to extend @xmath21 past the @xmath24 point so that there is a cauchy surface on which both families of solutions are defined",
    ". this would normally require solving equation   with a time - dependent boundary condition at the point where the mirror is introduced .",
    "however , for infinitely fast introduction of the mirror the dynamics can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we simply extend @xmath21 using free evolution of the field and then we calculate the scalar products , which leads to these bogoliubov coefficients :    [ eq : bogocoeffs ] @xmath25    where    [ eq : nus ] @xmath26    at this point it is worth mentioning that a more careful calculation of these bogoliubov coefficients has been performed in  @xcite , which involves solving eq .   with a time - dependent boundary condition .",
    "there , @xmath9 is enforced with a boundary condition ( for spatially even solutions ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 smoothly changes from @xmath29 to infinity as the mirror is introduced .",
    "the obtained bogoliubov coefficients for an evolution satisfying condition   can be seen to reduce to the coefficients in the instantaneous mirror introduction limit .",
    "thus , our approximation that neglects the dynamics is well founded .",
    "let us proceed by briefly reviewing the quantized version of the model introduced in the previous section . in the canonical quantization procedure with each solution @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is a uv cutoff )",
    "we associate a pair of time - independent hermitian quadrature operators @xmath32 .",
    "the quadrature operators obey canonical bosonic commutation relations : @xmath33 similarly , we associate quadrature operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the solutions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "since the bogoliubov transformation   is linear in quadrature operators , the transformed state will also be gaussian .",
    "therefore , the first and second statistical moments are sufficient to characterize both the initial and final states , i.e. , the state of the field before and after the introduction of the mirror .",
    "the first moments are given by a vector of expectation values , @xmath44 while the second moments are given by a covariance matrix , which consists of @xmath42 blocks defined in the following way : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the anticommutator .",
    "the bogoliubov transformation   implies the following transformation laws for the vector of first moments and the covariance matrix hold :    @xmath48    finally , we are interested in two properties of the state after transformation , namely entanglement and the average number of particles . to calculate these",

    "these results are in strong contrast to what is obtained with the vacuum as the initial state  @xcite , where the number of particles produced is much smaller than any conceivable thermal background .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that similar benefits of nonvacuum initial states have been shown for the shaking - cavity dynamical casimir effect  @xcite .",
