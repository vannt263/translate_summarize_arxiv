    "recent progress in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and other surface - manipulation techniques at the atomic scale has made it possible to build low - dimensional magnetic structures with unprecedented control @xcite .",
    "atomic - scale magnetic structures possess an enormous potential for applications in spintronics as well as in classical and quantum computation due to their ability to store and process ( quantum ) information in the atomic spins .",
    "however , in order to build reliable atomic - size memories or qubits out of such systems , it is crucial to understand how the coupling to the environment affects their properties .",
    "for instance , it is known that quantum nanomagnets coupled to electronic degrees of freedom are prone to the effects of decoherence induced by ohmic quantum dissipation @xcite .",
    "in addition to their interest for information technologies , low - dimensional magnetic systems coupled to dissipative environments are also very important from the point of view of fundamental physics .",
    "this is because they allow to study the crossover from quantum to classical behavior as the coupling to the environment is increased @xcite .",
    "current theoretical models that describe local quantum degrees of freedom coupled to sources of dissipation predict rich and interesting physical phenomena at low temperatures , including quantum phase transitions and quantum criticality , as well as broken continuous symmetries and long - range order ( lro ) in low - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the interplay between quantum fluctuations , which are induced by quantum confinement and reduced dimensionality , and quantum dissipation , caused by the interaction with the environment , is at the core of this exotic behavior . from this perspective ,",
    "magnetic nanostructures built on the top of clean metals offer a unique platform to test our understanding on dissipative quantum systems .",
    "for instance , the simplest zero - dimensional ( 0d ) case of a single magnetic impurity coupled to a metallic environment [ such like a co or mn adatom sitting on a au(111 ) surface ] is a practical realization of the celebrated kondo effect , one of the most paradigmatic phenomena in the physics of strongly correlated electrons @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is the spin - compensation by the conduction electrons of the magnetic moment @xmath2 of an impurity embedded in a metallic host at temperatures @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the so - called kondo temperature .",
    "eventually , at @xmath5 , the ground state of the system is a many - body singlet ( termed a ` kondo singlet ' ) , formed by a linear superposition of @xmath2 and the spin of a cloud of conduction electrons that is anti - ferromagnetically correlated with the impurity local moment .",
    "the original magnetic impurity @xmath2 is thus completely screened by the metallic environment . in the context of magnetic adatoms deposited on clean metallic surfaces ,",
    "this is a well - established phenomenon , which reveals itself as a narrow fano resonance at the fermi energy in the sts spectra @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the extension of the single kondo impurity to the case of many interacting magnetic impurities embedded in a metallic host represents a formidable theoretical challenge . due to the many - body nature of the problem , exact methods are only limited to simple cases ( i.e. , consisting of few magnetic impurities ) , and at the cost expensive numerical calculations @xcite . on the other hand , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) methods",
    "@xcite provide reliable results in the case of bulk 3d compounds , but are much less successful when applied to low - dimensional systems .",
    "one particular class of such low - dimensional systems , namely , one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains of magnetic atoms or organic molecules with active magnetic atoms , are currently under intensive experimental investigation @xcite .",
    "thus , by depositing @xmath6 monolayer ( ml ) of co on pt(997 ) , which is a vicinal surface containing steps , chains of magnetic atoms have been recently created  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic co atoms decorate the steps and form ferromagnetic chains , which , when probed by an external magnetic field , typically exhibit superparamagnetism .",
    "however , in the case of co chains at temperatures @xmath7 k , the magneto - crystalline anisotropy results in relaxation times which are longer than the experimental typical timescale , and the response of the system becomes effectively ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "another recently reported system , consisting of chains of co atoms on cu(775 ) , has been shown to undergo a peierls distortion leading to dimerization @xcite .",
    "this dimerized phase has been explained by the strong correlations existing in the partially filled @xmath8 shells of the co atoms , which are in the high spin configuration .",
    "maintaining the high spin in a geometry where the overlap between the d orbitals is small and correlations are strong , favors a ferromagnetic ground state , which in turn makes the charge - density wave instability possible .    in the above - mentioned systems , the coupling to the metallic substrate",
    "was assumed to be weak , and therefore was neglected in their analysis .",
    "however , as we show below , the metallic environment can have dramatic effects for the phase diagram at low temperatures , and it can not be neglected when studying the magnetic excitations of the chain . with these systems in mind , in this contribution we focus on the analysis of an easy - axis ferromagnetic ( fm ) 1d spin chain deposited on the top of a metallic surface .",
    "interestingly , as a function of the coupling with the substrate , we predict a quantum phase transition from an ising ferromagnetic phase with long range order to a paramagnetic phase where quantum fluctuations proliferate and destroy the ordered phase . although modifying the coupling to the substrate in the experimental systems created so far may be hard , in the future other systems can be created where the coupling to the substrate could be tuned , uncovering even more interesting phenomena .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce a simple model to describe an easy - axis @xmath0 ferromagnetic chain on a metallic substrate .",
    "this model is studied in the framework of mean - field theory in section  [ sec : mft ] , and the quantum phase diagram is thus obtained . the phase diagram is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_phase_diag ] , and it is one of the most important results of this work . in section  [ sec : holtsein ]",
    "we consider the excitation spectra of the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we show that a weak coupling with the metallic substrate can have important consequences for the magnetic excitations of the ferromagnetic chain .",
    "this properties of the excitations , and in particular , the substrate - induced damping , can be accessible by experimental probes such as spin - polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy ( speels ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_response ] , we plot the spin - response of the 1d spin chain due the substrate - modified magnon excitation spectrum , which is also an important result of this work .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] , we offer our conclusions and outlook for future research directions . in the [ sec : bosonization_and_mapping ] , we give more details about the technical aspects of our calculations .",
    "let us consider a chain of magnetic atoms deposited on top of metallic surface ( see fig . [",

    "assuming that the impurity spin is @xmath11 implies that the single - ion anisotropy @xmath12 reduces to a constant term .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath11 , exchange terms like @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of @xmath14 . however , for impurities with @xmath15 such terms must be taken into account , but we shall not pursue their analysis here .    the nature of the ground state of eq .",

    "the spin waves ( magnons ) and their bound states are separated from the ground state by a gap  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath21 , the spin chain hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) exhibits a _",

    "however , as anticipated in the introduction , in what follows we will focus only on the fm ising limit @xmath19 of ( [ eq : h0 ] ) , and we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a complementary study in the case of easy - plane anisotropy , where the spin chain exhibits an _",

    "nevertheless , we note that the results reported in section  [ sec : mft ] are also applicable to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) regime corresponding to @xmath22 ( see section  [ sec : concl ] ) .",

    "note that this model bears some similarity with the kondo - lattice model , which is used to describe the properties of heavy - fermion systems @xcite . in the case of impurities with @xmath15 ,",
    "the kondo exchange involves more channels ( with channel - dependent couplings ) and results in a dynamical screening of the impurity spins occurring in several stages , involving different kondo temperatures  @xcite    .",
    "we shall not pursue such an analysis here .     local bath approximation . for impurities embedded in a 2d or 3d metallic substrate ,",
    "the interference of kondo screening clouds is negligible when the impurities are separated by a few fermi wave numbers @xmath29 @xcite , and therefore can be considered as independently screened @xcite . ]    despite its simplicity , the model introduced above still represents a formidable theoretical challenge , and in order to make analytical progress we shall introduce some simplifying assumptions .",
    "we approximate the metallic substrate by a collection of one - dimensional metals ( cf .",
    "[ fig : local - bath - approximation ] ) described by the hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 creates an electron with linear momentum @xmath32 and spin projection @xmath33 .",
    "the index @xmath26 indicates that the electron reservoir described by the operators @xmath34 is only coupled to the impurity located at @xmath35 and not to others with @xmath36 .",
    "for this reason , we dubbed this approximation the `` local bath approximation '' ( lba )  @xcite . within the lba ,",
    "the spin - density operator reads : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the dimensionality of the substrate is crucial for the justification of the lba .",
    "when the magnetic impurities embedded in a high - dimensional ( 2d or 3d ) metallic substrate are separated by a distance of the order of a few @xmath29 , with @xmath39 the fermi wavevector of conduction electrons , the interference of kondo screening clouds that dynamically quench the magnetic moments , becomes negligible @xcite .",
    "consequently , at distances @xmath40 the impurities can be considered as independently screened @xcite .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the case of a strictly 1d metallic substrate , as in the case of the 1d kondo - lattice model @xcite . in that case , the single kondo - impurity limit is reached only at distances @xmath41 . since the kondo temperature @xmath4 is an exponentially small scale , in the purely 1d geometry the single - impurity regime is only reached at extremely dilute impurity - spin concentrations @xcite .    in actual experiments , although the magnetic nanostructures are built on the top of a metallic surface , @xmath39 is determined by the 3d bulk electron density due to a non - vanishing overlap between the bulk and surface conduction states @xcite . for instance , the fermi wave number for au bulk free conduction electrons is @xmath42 , while for au(111 ) surface states is @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this fact dramatically increases the range of applicability of the lba . the physical picture provided by the lba is also supported by the behavior of the sts fano line shapes in experiments on magnetic co atoms deposited on cu@xmath44 and separated by distances @xmath45 , which are identical to the single - impurity sts line shapes @xcite .",
    "in addition , although in the actual experimental realizations the limit @xmath46 might not be strictly realized , the model resulting from applying the lba to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h0],[eq : hk ] ) can be considered as the simplest `` toy model '' that captures the competition between the kondo physics , which is a local quantum critical phenomenon , and the magnetic interactions along the chain @xcite .",
    "concerning the latter , it is worth noting that the lba can not reproduce the non - local rkky exchange coupling mediated by the metal and arising at order @xmath47 .",
    "as mentioned before , this is not a crucial drawback , since one can always redefine the couplings @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) to take the rkky contribution explicitly into account . more importantly ,",
    "what eventually justifies the separate treatment of rkky and kondo interactions is that , although they both originate in the same hamiltonian ( [ eq : hk ] ) , the rkky interaction results from electronic states deep inside the fermi sea and is a static coupling , while the kondo effect is purely dynamical effect originated predominantly in the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "in order to gain insight into the low - temperature phase diagram of the system , we now focus on the limit @xmath19 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , describing an isolated fm ising spin chain . in that case",
    ", the ground state of the isolated chain is separated from the single - magnon excitation spectrum by a gap @xmath50 and by a gap @xmath51 from the two - magnon bound states  @xcite .",
    "this means that the long - range fm order in the isolated chain is stable at low temperatures and , to a first approximation , it is safe to take @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the coupling to the substrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : hk ] ) , which has important consequences for the low - temperature behavior of the the spin chain .",
    "for instance , the nature of the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition is profoundly modified . as we show in the [ sec : bosonization_and_mapping ] , in the case @xmath52 the model for the ising chain coupled to the substrate can be mapped onto the 1d dissipative quantum ising model , which is in the universality class of the classical 3d ( instead of 1d ) ising model . in the following , we exploit this fact to introduce a mean - field ( mf ) approach , which therefore provides a good description of the phases of the spin chain in the ( easy - axis ) ising limit .",
    "we introduce the mf approximation to the ising term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) by making the replacement @xmath53 , which leads to the mf hamiltonian of the spin chain : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the local weiss field .",
    "the mf hamiltonian of the system is therefore written as @xmath56+j_{k}^{z}s_{i}^{z}s^{z}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   &   & -h_{\\text{eff}}s_{i}^{z}+\\mathcal{h}_{fi},\\label{eq : h_mf_local}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 describing the @xmath26-th conduction electron bath . in the following we drop the lattice sub - index @xmath26 in @xmath58 and @xmath59 in order to lighten the notation .",
    "we note that the mf approximation together with the lba leads to a set of independent kondo - impurity problems in an effective magnetic field @xmath60 , which is a quantity that must be obtained self - consistently .",
    "the mf thermodynamical properties of the spin - chain can therefore be obtained from the free - energy @xmath61 $ ] for a single kondo impurity in a magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "note that the weiss field @xmath62 does not act upon the conduction electrons , it only acts on the impurity .",
    "the mean - field self - consistency condition is obtained from the relation between the impurity magnetization , @xmath63 and the definition of the weiss field eq .",

    "( [ eq : transf_u ] ) ] , the anisotropic kondo model can be mapped onto the resonant - level model @xcite .",
    "the resonant - level model is exactly solvable when the parameter @xmath66 is chosen at the so - called `` toulouse line '' @xcite , defined by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the density of states and lattice parameter of the bosonized 1d chains , respectively ( cf .

    "we shall focus in particular on single magnon excitations that can be created by probes ( such like spin - polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy , speels , see section [ sec : experiments ] ) that couple weakly to the ferromagnetic chains .",
    "such probes are assumed to produce single spin - flips , and thus the calculation of the system response can be carried out within linear response theory .",

    "the above contribution is quadratic , and replacing it into ( [ eq : s_eff_definition ] ) leads to the effective action    @xmath140 & = & - \\frac{1}{\\hbar^{2}\\beta}\\sum_{q,\\omega_{n}}\\left[g_{q}\\left(\\omega_{n}\\right)\\right]^{-1}\\bar{b}_{q}\\left(\\omega_{n}\\right)b_{q}\\left(\\omega_{n}\\right),\\label{eq : s_eff_hp_final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined the magnon propagator @xcite @xmath141 with @xmath142 a dimensionless parameter quantifying the dissipation caused by the conduction electrons on the spin chain .",
    "we next perform the analytic continuation to real frequencies , in order to obtain the retarded magnon propagator . thus , replacing @xmath143 and @xmath144 , yields @xmath145 thus , the pole of the propagator becomes @xmath146 , for small @xmath33 , which implies that the coupling to the metal eq .",
    "( [ eq : hk_hp ] ) induces a finite lifetime @xmath147 and damping on the magnon excitations .",
    "physically , this happens due to the presence of gapless particle - hole excitations in the excitation spectrum of the metallic substrate , and it can be interpreted as landau damping @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this damping does not vanish in the limit @xmath148 . at first sight , this may seem surprising , since in the @xmath148 limit , magnon excitations correspond to a uniform magnetization along the @xmath149 direction .",
    "thus , the total projection of the spin along @xmath149 , i.e. , @xmath150 , is a conserved quantity in the absence of coupling to the substrate . in other words ,",
    "the number of magnons @xmath151 is a conserved quantity of hamiltonian in ( [ eq : h0_hp ] ) .",
    "however , in the presence of @xmath152 [ eq . ( [ eq : hk_hp ] ) ] , @xmath153 is no longer conserved ( i.e. the magnons @xmath154 can `` leak out '' from the chain ) , and therefore total magnetization fluctuations also become damped out by the coupling to the substrate .",
    "the above treatment is valid provided the coupling to the substrate is weak and can be treated perturbatively . at stronger coupling , we have to worry about the possibility that the magnetic moments of the impurities are kondo - screened by the substrate electrons . to deal with this situation",
    ", we shall rely on the non - perturbative treatment discussed in the [ sec : bosonization_and_mapping ] . as shown there , in the strong - coupling limit where kondo correlations are important , it is possible to map the model introduced in section  [ sec : model ] to a dissipative quantum ising model .",

    "this result suggests that the quantum critical point ( qpc ) separating the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : mf_phase_diag ] ) can be described by this field theory , and therefore the critical exponents around the qcp will correspond to those of the wilson - fisher fixed - point of the renormalization group  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , for a survey ) .",
    "however , in deriving the map to the dissipative quantum ising model , we have neglected the heisenberg term @xmath164 $ ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , the field theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi4 ] ) , is capable of describing the phases of the system .",
    "focusing on the ferromagnetic phase where @xmath165 , which corresponds to @xmath166 , it can be seen that the magnon excitations are indeed described by the propagator : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the energy gap .",
    "this magnon propagator indicates that the magnetic excitations of the chain in the strong coupling regime are overdamped by their coupling to the metallic substrate .",
    "physically , this makes sense as the impurity spins are screened by the metal electrons and thus their magnetic moments undergo strong damping by the collective nature of their screening clouds .",
    "this regime must be contrasted with the weak - coupling regime , where we found the damping to be weak .",
    "thus , a physical picture emerges that allows us to distinguish the two mean - field solutions that we briefly described at the end of section  [ sec : mft ] ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mft ] ) : in the weak coupling regime , the strong weiss field ( i.e. @xmath96 ) due to the fm coupling of the impurities along the chain does not allow for the kondo screening of the local moments of the atoms in the chain . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnetic excitations of the chain are only weakly affected by their coupling to the substrate , and thus acquire a small line - width . on the other hand , in the strong coupling regime , the weiss field is much weaker ( i.e. @xmath95 ) and the magnetic moments are effectively screened by the metal electrons , leading to overdamped magnetic excitations . in the next section , we shall study some experimental consequences of our findings .",

    "the broadening of the magnon excitation is originated in the ( kondo ) coupling to the metallic substrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : hk ] ) . ]",

    "the curves @xmath183 show resonances centered at the magnon frequencies @xmath184 ( red line in the bottom @xmath172 plane ) , which are broadened by the effect of @xmath33 , the dimensionless coupling to the metal .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram and the excitation spectrum of a magnetic chain of atoms or molecules with easy - axis ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we focused on a simple model of @xmath11 magnetic impurities displaying a kondo - exchange interaction with the substrate . in the ising limit , which provides a good approximation to the ground state of an easy - axis ferromagnet",
    ", we obtained the phase diagram using a mean - field theory approach .",
    "we find that this system exhibits two possible phases at zero temperature : a paramagnetic phase where the impurity spins are screened by the substrate , and a gapped ferromagnetic phase whose excitations are damped by the magnetic ( kondo ) exchange with the metallic substrate .",
    "using a bosonic representation for the spins as well as various types of mathematical mappings between models , we have also investigated the excitation spectrum in the ferromagnetic phase , which may be accessible through probes like spin - polarized electron energy loss ( speels ) .",
    "although we have focused mainly on an easy - axis ferromagnetic ( fm ) chain , it is worth describing how our results can be modified in the case of the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) chain corresponding to the parameter regime @xmath22 of the _ xxz _ chain described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) . an experimental motivation to extend our results to this regime can be found , for instance , in ref .",
    "relying on the local bath approximation ( lba ) and in the ising limit , it is possible to apply the transformation @xmath185 , which maps the afm to onto fm ising chain . in presence of the kondo exchange",

    "the excitations are separated from the ground state by a gap @xmath189 .",
    "using the holstein - primakoff representation  @xcite , we can compute the spectrum of an antiferromagnetic _ xxz _ chain , which yields @xmath190 .",
    "the results of sections  [ sec : holtsein ] and [ sec : experiments ] carry over to the afm ( @xmath191 ) case provided we replace @xmath192 by @xmath193 .",
    "a feature of the afm regime that is also worth noticing is that bound states of magnons are absent from the spectrum @xcite .",
    "finally , let us discuss our outlook for future research directions .",
    "one such direction is the study of the phases of chains of impurities with higher ( i.e. @xmath15 ) spin . in this case , it is also possible to apply the same mean - field theory employed in section  [ sec : mft ] .",
    "however , in order to obtain the impurity magnetization @xmath194 we must in general resort to an impurity solver such as wilson s numerical renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "this is specially true for @xmath15 , which will will undergo a several stage kondo effect  @xcite and possibly underscreening  @xcite .",
    "another interesting direction will be to asses the accuracy of the local bath approximation employed throughout .",
    "this remains quite a challenge , which will most likely require to rely on numerical methods , such as quantum monte carlo .",
    "indeed , it is possible that this approximation only provides an rough picture of the paramagnetic phase , which must be corrected by the inclusion of the coupling between the different baths that screen the magnetic impurities individually .",
    "however , we believe that such effects will be less important in the ferromagnetic phase ( specially for large @xmath78 ) , due to the existence of a gap that separates the ferromagnetic ground state from the excitations and therefore protects the ground state from perturbations .",
    "in this appendix , we implement the abelian bosonization approach to the semi - infinite fermionic 1d chains along the @xmath195 direction in fig .",
