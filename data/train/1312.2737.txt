    "orion ( known as _ waluku _ in javanese ) is special constellation for people around equator and becomes an icon for equatorial heaven . in the heart of this constellation",
    ", there is a young embedded orion nebula cluster ( onc ) with its exotic trapezium stars ( @xmath7 ori ) as an evident of mass segregation in young cluster @xcite .",
    "aggregates of relatively more massive stars in the center form hierarchical multiple stellar system as already observed clearly @xcite . among 5 prominence systems",
    "( @xmath7 ori a ",
    "e ) , @xmath7 ori b is interesting with 5 members and algol type eclipsing binary as its parent / central , known as bm orionis .",
    "bm ori ( hd37021 ) which located at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is eclipsing binary with b v star as primary and larger but less massive star as secondary component @xcite .",
    "eventhough study about this system converges toward one conclusion about the primary component , physical parameters of the secondary are still uncertain . light curve with shallow secondary minima and nearly unresolved spectra keeps bm ori in mystery .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the observed phenomena , such as secondary star with flatten disk @xcite and disk shell @xcite or spherical shell @xcite surrounding the primary .    based on its light curve ,",
    "it s obvious that bm ori is detached system @xcite , but the interaction between components will influence future evolution of the binary and also the stability of multiple system as a whole . primary component will soon leave main sequence open the mass transfer channel toward its couple",
    ". stellar evolution in this close binary system will be studied .",
    "this article is devided into 5 sections .",
    "the conducted observations toward bm ori and its environment are reviewed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 explains the orbital and physical properties of both primary and secondary component .",
    "section 4 describes the main tool and the results of the simulation .",
    "section 5 gives the closing remarks .",
    "photometric observation of bm ori and its vicinities have been done intensively since mid-1900s using johnson ubv filter @xcite .",
    "variability of this eclipsing binary has period of @xmath10 days and amplitude of @xmath11 mag .",
    "these early photometric study also concluded that secondary component is 3 times larger that the primary .",
    "spectroscopic observation of this system has its own challanges which come from intrinsic properties of the binary and the nebular environment of onc . although successfully measured radial velocity of primary component , johnson ( 1965 ) and doremus ( 1970 ) havent identify the spectra of secondary component .",
    "several years later , popper & plavec ( 1976 ) used d - line ( @xmath12 ) to measure secondary star s kinematics .",
    "next decade , ismailov ( 1988 ) analysed he i lines that represents primary component and metal lines ( fe i , ca ii and mg ii ) that represents the secondary .",
    "emission profile that was found among the metal lines may indicate the presence of a shell .",
    "spectroscopic observations during eclipse have also been carried out to gain microturbulence speed and abundances of some important metals @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundace of the primary star just yet determined qualitatively .",
    "the only conclusion was that primary star has helium abundance comparable to the sun .",
    "in addition to photometry and spectroscopy , direct imaging and astrometry observations to clarify multiplicity of trapezium stars have been conducted @xcite . from those observations ,",
    "@xmath7 ori b is confirmed as multiple stellar system with ( at least ) 5 member , bm ori ( @xmath7 ori b1 ) becomes the central body , surrounded by b2 , b3 and less massive b4 .",
    "bm ori located in the heart of onc , 418 pc away from the sun @xcite .",
    "this eclipsing binary has nearly circular orbit with period of 6.470525 days @xcite and orbital separation of @xmath13 r@xmath1 .",
    "here is the ephemeris of bm ori : @xmath14    this eclipsing binary with nearly @xmath15 inclination is believed as detached system which experiences partial eclipse .",
    "the _ roche lobe _ filling factor of this system is 0.16 and 0.90 for primary and secondary component respectively @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : orbit ] summarizes orbital parameters from literatures .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      departing from hayashi track , both primary and secondary star contracts to attain new hydrodynamic equilibrium as main sequence star , but with different time scale ( less massive star spends more time ) . during this evolutionary stage",
    ", there is no significant difference between non - rotating and rotating models .",
    "this result has similar trend compared to rotating model of martin & claret ( 1996 ) , though their model has smaller mass and faster rotation .",
    "rotating stars have different gravity potential which may influence their internal structure .",
    "this is more clearly demonstrated in the post - main sequence evolution .      to make comparison between the model and the observed propertis is not straightforward process since the age of both stars are not precisely determined .",
    "previous study gave a possible range of @xmath16 years .",
    "primary component has already reached main sequence at age of @xmath17 years .",
    "its structure does not change much during main sequence stage that lasts until the age of @xmath18 years .",
    "the present age of secondary component is harder to approximate because of its pre - main sequence nature .",
    "but , as binary component with nearly circular orbit , it is more likely that secondary star formed almost in the same epoch , together with its pair .",
    "although theory of binary star formation does nt demand simultaneous formation , observation bring evidents toward coevality @xcite",
    ". then age range of @xmath19 years for both components is reasonable in order to compare model and observation .",
    "as plotted in hr diagram ( figure [ fig : hrdiag ] ) , main sequence of 5.9 m@xmath1 model is rather fit to measured temperature and luminosity of the primary component .",
    "both rotating and non - rotating model show almost similar properties , but rotating model has a bit smaller effective temperature ( see table [ tab : compare ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , evolutionary track of 2 m@xmath1 models are located below the observed properties of secondary star . at the age of @xmath20 or @xmath21",
    "both rotating and non - rotating model have the highest luminosity , but still 6.46 dimmer .",
    "difference between these two luminosity demands external processes to occure and add the stellar luminosity .",
    "accumulative reflection from primary component and heating by stellar wind may be sufficiently cover gap @xcite .",
    "later process is expected to give more contribution .",
    "as relatively close binary system , bm ori experiences complicated evolution involved mass transfer . after leaving main sequence at age of @xmath18 years , primary component starts to expand , fills its roche lobe and initiates mass transfer .",
    "this post - main sequence mass transfer is an example of case b of kippenhahn & wiegert ( 1967 ) .    in this model ,",
    "primary ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) and secondary star ( @xmath2 m@xmath1 ) are in the main sequence with similar age .",
    "both stars orbit the center of mass in circular orbit with orbital period of @xmath22 days . and here are evolutionary stages experienced by the system :    1 .",
    "primary component leaves main sequence when hydrogen fuel in the center is exhausted .",
    "the core shrinks while the envelope expands makes the star fills its roche lobe ( stage b in fig [ fig : mtrans ] ) .",
    "2 .   non - conservative mass transfer occurs , sometimes accreting star ( secondary ) gains same amount of mass transfer from the donor ( primary ) . in this model , mass transfer rate",
    "is kept to be constant at @xmath23 m@xmath1/tahun , almost similar to the model of de greve & de loore ( 1976 ) for intermediate mass system .",
    "expansion rate of the primary is overwhelmed such that the envelope has much larger radius compared to the orbital separation , common envelope is established . at the same time , star ignites helium burning ( stage d ) .",
    "4 .   donor star reaches a new equilibrium as helium star with smaller size and mass ( @xmath24 m@xmath1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "accretor becomes more massive ( @xmath25 m@xmath1 ) while the orbit becomes larger ( @xmath26 r@xmath1 and @xmath27 days ) .",
    "5 .   after 10 gyr",
    ", helium star leave its stable condition and expands again .",
    "second stage of mass transfer is initiated ( stage g ) sets aside smaller mass ( stage h ) when the simulation is terminated .",
    "in this study , previous observations and studies about bm ori as an interesting eclipsing binary in the heart of orion nebula cluster are reviewed . however ,",
    "physical parameters of secondary component are note well - determined .",
    "standard model with assumed parameters of @xmath0 m@xmath1 and @xmath2 m@xmath1 does fit with primary component but not for secondary .",
    "there must be an external mechanism occurs around the secondary to fill the luminoasity gap .",
    "simulated binary evolution after main sequence stage shows that mass transfer will transform the donor star to become helium star with stripped envelope . during this stable stage , total mass of the system is around 5.2 m@xmath1 , much lower that initial total mass . beside that , orbital parameters are change toward larger separation of @xmath28 r@xmath1 and shorter period of @xmath29 days .",
    "this condition undoubtfully influence the stability of @xmath7 ori b multiple system .",
    "further dynamical analysis need to be done to assess this .",
