    "hot subdwarf stars are very important for the study of stellar atmospheres .",
    "the chemical peculiarities of their atmospheres are still puzzling although research has been done in this field for more than four decades .",
    "@xcite discovered the helium deficiency of sdb stars for the first time .",
    "peculiar metal abundances were reported . while some metals showed solar abundances , others were depleted or even enriched .",
    "theoretical diffusion models yielded only little success .",
    "radiative levitation and mass loss caused by stellar winds counteract the gravitational settling @xcite . since the discovery of pulsating sdb stars , the metal content in their atmospheres became important for asteroseismology as well .",
    "several abundance studies of sdbs have been undertaken so far .",
    "most of the data was taken in the uv with different instruments ( iue , fuse , hst / stis , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some optical spectra at high resolution were taken with large telescopes ( e.g. keck / hires ) .",
    "the samples analysed so far consisted of only a few stars .",
    "sixty eight sdbs were observed in the course of the spy project with the high - resolution spectrograph uves at the esovlt . in order to derive the metal abundances we compared the observed spectra with rotationally - broadened , synthetic line profiles using an automatic analysis pipeline . for a standard set of 69 metal lines from 24 different ions an lte model spectrum with appropriate atmospheric parameters",
    "@xcite was automatically generated with linfor and fitted using the fitsb2 routine .",
    "ionization equilibria have been checked to be consistent in general to within the error limits , except for a few notorious cases .",
    "we searched for trends of the metal abundances with atmospheric parameters ( see * ? ? ? * ) and found correlations only with the effective temperature @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "the observed carbon abundances are subsolar and show a large scatter from star to star .",
    "four exceptional sdbs show nearly solar to supersolar abundances up to @xmath2 ( see next section ) .",
    "the nitrogen and oxygen abundances range from @xmath3 to solar .",
    "neon and magnesium are also depleted .",
    "a trend with temperature is present in the aluminium and phosphorus abundances .",
    "aluminium is enriched by @xmath4 , phosphorus by @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to this , the silicon and sulfur abundances show a large scatter of @xmath6 and no trend with temperature .",
    "argon is enriched to @xmath7 and shows a clear trend with temperature .",
    "potassium is identified in an sdb for the first time .",
    "it is strongly enriched up to @xmath8 and correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "doubly ionized calcium appears at higher temperatures with abundances of up to @xmath9 .",
    "scandium , titanium , vanadium , and chromium are highly supersolar ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) .",
    "scandium and chromium show a clear trend with temperature , which is less pronounced for titanium and vanadium .",
    "the iron abundance shows no trend all over the parameter space and remains nearly solar .",
    "cobalt could be measured in five stars only and upper limits are given for all others .",
    "the metal abundances of the programme stars show a universal pattern , which could not been seen before .",
    "while the light elements carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , neon , magnesium as well as iron are not correlated with temperature , all heavier elements from aluminium to chromium are more abundant the hotter the star gets .",
    "diffusion timescales are much shorter than the lifetime on the ehb hence an equilibrium abundance between radiative levitation , gravitational settling and a weak stellar wind should be reached . at higher temperatures , where radiative levitation plays a more important role , this equilibrium should be shifted to higher abundances of those heavy elements , which are not abundant in the sun . the lower the elemental abundance , the higher the uv photon flux and therefore the radiation pressure .",
    "an increase in the abundance leads to a decrease of the photon flux and a saturation effect @xcite .",
    "this is exactly what can be seen in the data .",
    "while the equilibrium abundance does not change in case of the light elements ( except helium ) within the sdb temperature range , all elements heavier than magnesium are enriched .",
    "since the primordial iron abundance is much higher than the abundances of the other heavy elements , saturation is more likely and seems to be the reason for the constant iron abundances .",
    "although the general pattern may be qualitatively explained in this way , some questions remain open .",
    "all observed trends are superimposed by a scatter from star to star .",
    "the abundance difference between stars with similar temperature can be as high as @xmath12 for some elements ( e.g. silicon or sulfur ) .",
    "on the other hand there is little scatter for other elements ( e.g. nitrogen or iron ) .",
    "four sdbs show a strong enrichment in carbon from nearly solar to ten times solar .",
    "their helium abundance is high compared to the rest of the sample .",
    "they are situated at the hot end of the ehb , but this region is not exclusively occupied by these carbon - rich sdbs .",
    "other subdwarfs with very similar atmospheric parameters do nt show any carbon enrichment .    if diffusion in the stellar atmosphere is the only reason for the observed abundance patterns , why do we see two different carbon abundances at the same atmospheric parameters ?",
    "a mechanism is needed which constantly transports helium and carbon in the atmosphere and therefore counteracts diffusion at least to some extent .",
    "weak photospheric convection may be this mechanism .",
    "non - canonical formation scenarios like wd merger or late hot flasher @xcite may provide the initial enrichment of helium and carbon necessary to form a small convection zone @xcite .",
    "carbon - rich sdbs may therefore be formed in a similar way as he - sdb / sdos @xcite .",
