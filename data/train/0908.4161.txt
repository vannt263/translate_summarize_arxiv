    "astronomical observations indicate the existence of magnetic fields in galaxies and also in cosmological scales with coherence lengths as big as 1 mpc and with the magnitude of order @xmath1 gauss , for more details see @xcite . the origin of the cosmic magnetic fields are not well - understood .",
    "one possible explanation is that they may have primordial origin which are later amplified by galactic dynamo mechanism into the current observed value .",
    "the estimation for the magnitude of the primordial seed is not certain .",
    "conventionally , it is assumed that a seed in the range @xmath2 gauss at the time of matter - radiation decoupling may be required for dynamo mechanism to produce the current observational value .",
    "this lower bound may be relaxed to @xmath3 gauss in a flat dark energy dominated universe @xcite .    starting with the work of turner and widrow @xcite , during past two decades",
    "there were some attempts to obtain primordial magnetic seed through inflation @xcite .",
    "in particular , inflation can naturally stretch small micro - physical scales inside a casual patch into the cosmological sizes .",
    "this can provide an elegant mechanism to explain the coherence of magnetic fields on distances much bigger than astrophysical scales .",
    "the key obstacle , however , in producing magnetic field during inflation ( in general in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background ) is the conformal invariance . to produce magnetic field",
    "one has to break the conformal invariance of the classical electrodynamics .",
    "there are several mechanisms to break conformal invariance .",
    "these include : coupling electrodynamics non - minimally to gravity which produce a time - dependent mass for photon @xcite , introducing a time - dependent gauge kinetic coupling @xcite , and coupling the photon to a charged scalar field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we combine the last two mentioned methods together in order to break the conformal invariance and obtain an appreciable amount of seed magnetic field .",
    "we consider the model where the inflaton field is a complex scalar field coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "the conformal invariance is broken dynamically when the scalar field is displaced from its minimum during inflation .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependence of the gauge kinetic coupling as in @xcite can help to produce a considerable amount of primordial magnetic fields seed required for galactic dynamo .",
    "as indicated recently in @xcite , the key constraints in models with time - varying gauge coupling are ( a ) : the requirement that the time - dependent gauge coupling remains small for all time during inflation , so the perturbative gauge theory is under control and ( b ) : one must check that the strong back reaction from gauge field does not destroy the inflationary background .",
    "we shall see that these constraints in addition with the requirement to have sufficient inflation basically control the amplitude of the magnetic fields seed produced .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we present our set up . in section [ magnetic ] the magnetic fields produced in our model",
    "are studied followed by discussions and conclusion in section [ conclusion ] . while this paper was in its final stage , the work @xcite appeared which has some overlaps with our studies .",

    "this may arise for example in string theory setup where the gauge kinetic action is coupled to the dilaton which is running with time .",
    "as suggested in @xcite one may also consider that the time dependence of @xmath6 originates from the time dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "this may be obtained by replacing @xmath12 .",
    "but this has the problem that the kinetic action @xmath13 becomes modified under @xmath12 and the gauge invariant is lost . at the phenomenological level , we shall take @xmath9 to be constant and assume the time dependence of @xmath6 originates from the coupling of the gauge kinetic action to other fields such as dilaton",
    ". however , the dynamics of the dilaton should be such that it does not destroy the slow - roll properties of the inflationary potential .",

    "here we study magnetic field production during inflation . as is well - known , magnetic field production in frw backgrounds is heavily suppressed due to the conformal invariance . to produce a significant amount of magnetic field , conformal invariance of the maxwell equation should be broken . as we see from eqs .",
