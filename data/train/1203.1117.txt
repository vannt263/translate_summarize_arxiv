    "free fluid - fluid interfaces produce fascinating patterns in nature . from the simple geometry of drops , bubbles and micelles @xcite , to the complex but regular arrangement of films inside a liquid foam @xcite , the concept of interfacial energy allows us to rationalize the change of bulk properties at the boundaries between two immiscible fluids . in the case of liquid - gas interfaces ,",
    "deformation of the interface by a solid object and the subsequent measurement of the force exterted by one on the other is still a widely - used technique to quantify the surface tension ( for instance the du noy ring and wilhelmy plate methods @xcite ) . in many cases the object that pierces",
    "the interface is cylindrical , and the deformation of a flat liquid - gas interface due to the contact of a solid rod is a situation of interest in both solid and fluid mechanics .",
    "the propulsion of insects that walk on water is possible because of the force between the interface and the rigid cylindrical legs @xcite .",
    "if the latter are flexible , then a new class of so - called `` elasto - capillary '' or `` wet - hair '' problems @xcite arise with major applications in nano- or microdevices .",
    "thus hairy surfaces , such as carbon nanotubes and biological filaments , are examples of the rich morphologies that arise from individual hair deformation and collapse @xcite and of the patterns seen in assemblies of hairs @xcite in the presence of a meniscus .",
    "related problems are encountered in surface processing , for example in fiber coating and in describing the wetting and cleaning properties of textiles @xcite ; or more specifically in probing the wetting properties of nanoscale droplets by deforming them with a cylindrical afm tip @xcite .",
    "finally , the mutual force between a soap film and a cylindrical liquid object , namely a micro - jet , was also found to be strong enough to cause the jet to deviate and to control its trajectory @xcite .    in general , the rise of a meniscus",
    "is fast @xcite compared to other relevant time - scales ( solvent evaporation , leg motion ) .",
    "consequently , the equilibrium shape of the gas - liquid interface and the minimum - energy principle are usually used to account for observations .    here , we use surface evolver @xcite simulations to study the deformation of an initially flat interface when it is pierced with an infinite cylinder .",
    "we report the effect of the inclination angle on the meniscus shape , the contact line position and on the force generated by the interaction . in the following",
    "we consider the case of a `` total wetting '' condition , meaning that the contact angle between the interface and the cylinder is zero .",
    "the results are general as long as the interface is governed only by surface tension , meaning that they can be directly applied to interfaces between two immiscible liquids , boundaries between a liquid and a gas , and to most 2d dimensional lamellae , including soap films , langmuir monolayers , lipid bilayers and biological membranes .",
    "the main control parameter is the inclination of the cylinder with respect to the plane of the unperturbed interface .",
    "the numerical study is compared with experiments in which a cylinder of liquid is brought into contact with a soap film ; above a certain liquid velocity the results are in good agreement with the model , offering further insight into the dynamical interaction between a cylinder and a film .",
    "as explained below , the more the cylinder is inclined , the greater the deformation of the meniscus and the greater the force exerted by the meniscus on the cylinder .",
    "this force is always perpendicular to the interface and its amplitude increases rapidly as the inclination is increased , diverging as the angle approaches 90@xmath0 .    the manuscript is organized as follows : the numerical and experimental systems are first presented , then we describe and characterize the position of the contact line in the simulations , compare with the experiments , and show how to calculate the force on the cylinder from the position of the contact line .",

    "all units are dimensionless , without loss of generality .",
    "we first create a planar surface in the @xmath8 plane with surface tension 1.005 in a fixed square frame of side - length 5.0 and a cylindrical rod , with axis in the vertical ( @xmath9 ) direction and radius @xmath10 , through its centre . to ensure that the rod is wetted",
    ", we include a virtual liquid film on the lower half of the rod with unit tension .",
    "the small difference in tension between the surface and this virtual film ensures that the contact angle is slightly greater than zero , alleviating numerical problems .",
    "the surface is meshed with many small triangular facets .",
    "we tested two levels of refinement , the first with about 12,000 triangles , and the second with an extra 2000 triangles in the region where the rod pierces the surface ; the refinement also controls the number of points around the contact line , giving 46 and 81 points respectively .",
    "both triangulations give equivalent results ( data not shown ) , which validates the robustness of the approach , and we show the more refined results below .",
    "one iteration consists of tilting the rod by @xmath11 in the @xmath12 plane and finding the new minimum area configuration of the surface ( fig .",

    "the location of the points along the contact line is recorded which , as we shall show below , is sufficient to calculate all quantities of interest .      to counteract the effects of bouyancy ( which dominate capillary forces at these length - scales )",
    ", we consider a double interface formed by a soap film , with surface tension @xmath13 , rather than the single interface separating a liquid from air .",
    "our conclusions remain valid for such an interface , but with half the value of the surface tension .",
    "the force exerted on a static glass rod by a meniscus , with a contact angle equal to @xmath2 , is zero . to generate a contact angle of @xmath3",
    ", we therefore use a laminar liquid jet directed through a soap film of the same composition , as described in @xcite .",
    "the flow in the jet plays a subtle role : the liquid flow within the soap film is slow , so the film adopts a quasistatic equilibrium shape , yet the boundary conditions are governed by the dynamics of the jet . as we shall demonstrate below , friction causes the contact line to move downstream , and in the limiting case imposes the required contact angle on the soap film .",
    "the liquid is a soap solution obtained by adding 5% of commercial dish - washing liquid ( dreft , procter & gamble ) to deionised water .",

    "a rod has two well - separated characteristic lengths ( radius and axial length ) so the force could , in principle , range over several orders of magnitude . in the case of an infinite rod ,",

    "it is clear that the vertical force model gives the best fit , and the good agreement with the measurements extends up to very large inclination angles .",

    "the flat interface model underestimates the force measurements . _ a priori _ we might have expected the opposite , as for the total perimeter model ( which also accounts for vertical local forces ) , but it significantly underestimates the real perimeter of the contact line : the presence of the cylinder perturbs the contour and there is a significant shift in the vertical direction @xmath71 which increases its perimeter .",
    "the vertical force model works well , and it would be interesting to see if this is also the case for `` partially wetted '' contact .",
    "based on an energy balance @xcite a vertical force model has also been used in the study of an elastic plate that pierces an interface , enabling the authors to infer a @xmath72 dependence to explain the different buckling morphologies of the plate under the effect of capillary forces .",
    "expression ( [ eq : mainresult ] ) could also be helpful in understanding the detachment of liquid droplets from fibres @xcite , in which a drop is pierced by a rod non - axisymmetrically .",
    "this complicated geometry has two contact lines that prevent the drop from being detached by gravity , and the rod is locally inclined to the surface of the drop .",
    "no exact expressions for the interface shape or contact line position are available , so that in @xcite an expression for the force was based on experimental data , with no divergence as the inclination angle increased .",
    "this is in contrast to our @xmath72 dependence for an infinite planar interface , which is explained by noting that our expression would fail as soon as the deformation of the contact lines became comparable to the distance between them or to the drop size . in that case",
    ", the total capillary force might saturate , which supports the maximal capillary force expression frequently used to describe detachment above a given drop size .",
    "the wetted contact of a free interface with a cylindrical object was studied both numerically and experimentally .",
