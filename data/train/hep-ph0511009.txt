    "two expansions are on the market ; one in the @xmath13 model in powers of @xmath14 @xcite which has now become commonly used , and one in the coupling @xcite , which we will use here . although it may potentially be less broadly applicable , it is straightforward to use and easy to understand",
    ". it is important to stress that the equations are self - consistent in a similar way to a gap equations , and that they resum infinite sets of diagrams .",
    "we study truncations of the coupling expansion of @xmath0 theory , with the action @xmath15     in the effective action ( first line ) .",
    "lines are full propagators @xmath16 , small circles the mean field @xmath17 . in the symmetric phase ( @xmath18 ) the first , second and fourth diagram vanish . in the broken phase @xmath19",

    "below , the derived self - energy contributions for the mean field ( second line ) and propagator ( third line ) . , width=576 ]    the model has two phases : the `` symmetric '' ( @xmath21 ) , where @xmath22 , and the `` broken '' ( @xmath23 ) , with @xmath24 .",
    "figure 1 shows the diagrams at the level of the action and the resulting contributions to the self - energies in orders of @xmath25 in either phase .",
    "the expansion is truncated at the order which is currently numerically tractable ; including further vertices leads to additional nested space - time `` memory integrals '' on the right hand side of the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) . at @xmath26 ,",
    "two additional diagrams exist for non - zero mean field .",
    "they are also not numerically tractable , and we consider the one ( basketball ) diagram included here to represent the effect of the full @xmath26 contribution .",
    "the aim is to determine whether one order dominates the next .    in the symmetric phase",
    ", only the `` leaf '' diagram contributes at @xmath27 , leading to the hartree approximation .",
    "we will consider this a trivial approximation , since it is simply a ( time - dependent ) contribution to the effective mass ( re@xmath28 ) , and it is included in the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "mode damping , equilibration and thermalization , processes of interest in out - of - equilibrium field theory , are the result of a non - zero _ imaginary _ part of the self - energy and in the symmetric phase , this appears at @xmath26 , in the last ( basketball ) diagram .",
    "detailed study of thermalization and equilibration in this truncation in 1 , 2 and 3 + 1 dimensions can be found in @xcite . in particular , the damping rate can be calculated in perturbation theory , the result being qualitatively compatible with the 2pi resummed result @xcite . apparently , the resummation has only a small , quantitative effect in this case .    in the broken phase ,",
    "the mean field leads to an effective three point vertex , and because @xmath30 is formally @xmath31 , an additional 2-loop diagram appears at order @xmath27 ( two - loop ) in the effective action . although in perturbation theory it does not lead to on - shell damping @xcite , resummation from the self - consistent evolution equations leads to a non - zero im@xmath32 . in this case , we are able to compare two successive truncations of im@xmath32 and estimate the quality of the expansion .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the effective particle number @xmath33 in time . we start with a `` top - hat '' ( t1 ) initial condition which is very out - of - equilibrium , and we can see a progression to a smooth bose - einstein - like distribution at time @xmath34 .",
    "the dark ( black ) dots are @xmath26 , the light ( green ) @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear , that not only does the resummation lead to a quantitative effect ( the non - zero im@xmath32 at @xmath27 ) , but the time scales of equilibration are also very similar . here , @xmath35 .",
    "this constitutes _ kinetic _ equilibration , and will ( at small coupling ) lead to a bose - einstein distribution with an effective temperature and chemical potential .     at various times . around time @xmath36 , the curve is smooth and approaching a bose - einstein distribution.,width=576 ]    the @xmath0 model has no conserved charges , and the asymptotic equilibrium state has zero chemical potential . to reach",
    "it requires _ chemical _ equilibration to take place as well .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath37 vs. @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "a bose - einstein distribution is then a straight line with slope @xmath40 and intercept @xmath41 .",
    "overlaid are the results for bose - einstein distributions with zero chemical potential .",
    "clearly , the low - momentum range has equilibrated kinetically , but not ( yet ) chemically .",
    "it is well known that at @xmath26 , chemical equilibration takes place ( see for instance @xcite ) . in figure 4",
    "we plot the total particle number @xmath42 normalized to the initial value . in both approximations",
    ", there is a change of particle number .",
    "although the behaviour is not the same , presumably they will both lead to chemical equilibration .     at time @xmath39 .",
    "the low momentum range has kinetically equilibrated .",
    "the straight line are bose - einstein distributions at various temperatures and zero chemical potential.,width=384 ]",
    "successive , non - trivial truncations of the coupling expansion of the 2pi/@xmath6-derivable approximation have been compared . in the broken phase of @xmath43 theory , kinetic and chemical equilibration",
    "is included at @xmath27 , at a rate very close to what we find at @xmath44 . at this moderate coupling",
    ", the expansion seems to be well behaved .",
    "in addition , we found that the relevant diagram at @xmath27 , which perturbatively does not lead to on - shell damping , becomes the dominant contribution when resummed by the self - consistent evolution equations .",
    "further investigation of the convergence of expansions of the 2pi effective action is needed .",
    "because of the numerical effort required , it may be necessary to consider simpler systems , such as quantum mechanics , as a testing ground .",
