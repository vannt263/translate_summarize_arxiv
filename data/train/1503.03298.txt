    "we note this minimum observation time is only an indicative quantity for determining when a gravitational wave signal will dominate the timing residuals for an individual pulsar ; it does not account for algorithms that correlate noise properties between pulsars , a point we discuss in more detail throughout .",
    "we do this in two ways , firstly by parametrising the timing noise in a model independent way , and secondly by applying the superfluid turbulence model of @xcite . in the first approach ,",
    "we express this minimum time in terms of three pulsar observables ; the amplitude and spectral index of the timing noise power spectral density and the turn - over frequency . the second approach is included as an example of how to relate pta observables to neutron star internal properties in the context of one particular physical model with only two free parameters .",
    "it does not imply any theoretical preference for the superfluid turbulence model , and will be extended to other physical models in the future .",

    "we apply the superfluid turbulence model to data and extract ` by - eye ' parameter estimates for various pulsars in the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) .",

    "if @xmath3 does _ not _ turn over , then the dashed blue curves show that the pulsar is insensitive to a gravitational wave signal until @xmath61 yr . the effect of a plateau in @xmath3 is therefore quite striking .",

    "pulsar timing array limits on the cosmological gravitational wave background are continually dropping to the point where they usefully constrain galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "positive detections , on the other hand , require a cross - correlation algorithm to simultaneously analyse timing residuals from multiple pulsars . such a detection will likely occur when the gravitational wave background is the largest component in the unmodelled portion of many individual pulsar s timing residuals @xcite . if the timing noise spectrum is steeper asymptotically ( at high @xmath18 ) than the gravitational wave spectrum , this is only possible if the timing noise spectrum flattens below some frequency , @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the minimum observation time required , given @xmath0 , before the gravitational wave background rises above the timing noise plateau in any specific pulsar .",
    "we calculate this minimum observation time both in a model - independent way , and for timing noise arising from superfluid turbulence .",
    "the latter model is selected not because it is necessarily preferred physically , but because it is simple , predictive and analytically tractable and therefore provides a test - bed for repeating the calculation with other physical models in the future .",
    "our results rely on the timing noise spectrum whitening below some threshold frequency , @xmath0 .",
    "this provides an observational diagnostic that can be used to infer the effectiveness of an individual pulsar in a pta .",
    "if , upon observing a pulsar for some @xmath100 , one finds that @xmath3 has not whitened below @xmath0 , that pulsar s capacity for assisting usefully in the detection of a gravitational wave background is severely diminished .",
    "the @xmath0 for a given pulsar is a function of the rotational parameters of the pulsar , and the gravitational wave amplitude and spectral index .",
    "therefore , using the prescription outlined in this paper , one can predict @xmath0 for a given pulsar and a given gravitational wave background .    in reality , measuring @xmath16 in a single pulsar is difficult .",
    "firstly , the noise in a given pulsar timing power spectrum is large , and secondly , the power in the lowest - frequency bin is generally dominated by the fact that a quadratic polynomial is fit to the timing residuals [ see @xcite ] .",
    "these two effects potentially mimic a low - frequency turn - over , implying multiple low - frequency bins are required to confirm the existence of a low - frequency cut - off .    many data analysis algorithms simultaneously fit the timing model and the unknown noise contributions for any individual pulsar . in this sense",

    "<S> phenomenological models of timing noise , such as from superfluid turbulence , suggest that the timing noise spectrum plateaus below some critical frequency , @xmath0 , potentially aiding the hunt for gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we examine this effect for individual pulsars by calculating minimum observation times , @xmath1 , over which the gravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau . </S>",
    "<S> we do this in two ways : 1 ) in a model - independent manner , and 2 ) by using the superfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how neutron star parameters can be constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the superfluid turbulence model can reproduce the data qualitatively from a number of pulsars observed as part of the parkes pulsar timing array . </S>",
    "<S> we further show how a value of @xmath0 , derived either through observations or theory , can be related to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a diagnostic whereby the usefulness of timing array pulsars for gravitational - wave detection can be quantified .    </S>",
