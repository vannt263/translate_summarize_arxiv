    "we have been studying properties of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 , @xmath3 gyr after the big bang and before @xmath4 . in this contribution",
    ", we present our recent results obtained for @xmath0 lbgs and possible evolution from @xmath0 lbgs to @xmath5 lbgs . our sample at @xmath0 was made in a field including the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) by using the subaru scam through @xmath6- , @xmath7- , and @xmath8-filters . since in and around the hdf - n field",
    "many spectroscopic data were available , the color criteria to select the @xmath9 lbgs can be reliably examined .",
    "a sample of @xmath0 lbgs was chosen from galaxies brighter than @xmath10 mag .",
    "a number of the sample is @xmath11 in an area of @xmath12 arcmin@xmath13 .",
    "uv luminosity function is presented by iwata et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2007 , 2008 this volume ) . in their results , from @xmath9 to @xmath14",
    ", a number of faint lbgs ( fainter than @xmath15 ) is increasing with redshift , while in the brighter part the number does not change significantly .",
    "although there is a controversy on this result , a luminosity dependent evolution of uv luminosity function is indicated .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations of a part of our lbg sample were made by ando et al .",
    "they found that uv luminous lbgs ( brighter than @xmath15 ) do not show large equivalent width of ly@xmath16 emission line .",
    "ando et al . ( 2006 ) showed this trend together with other lbgs as well as ly@xmath16 emitters ( laes ) .",
    "this may be due to the dusty environment or the presence of more massive hi gas in the luminous lbgs .",
    "using public irac data in the goods - n region and those obtained in the flanking fields , we constructed a @xmath0 lbg sample with irac photometry . from the sample of the lbgs",
    "mentioned above , we selected the lbgs those are free from the contamination by neighboring objects by eye inspection .",
    "the sample size is @xmath17 ; about half of them are detected both in irac channels 1 and 2 .",
    "we derived the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the sample , and made sed fitting .",
    "the spectral model adopted for the sed fitting we use is rather traditional , because we intend to compare with the results obtained in the previous studies at @xmath1 ; stellar synthesis code by bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) with 0.2 @xmath18 , the salpeter imf ( @xmath19 ) under constant star formation history , and calzetti extinction curve ( calzetti et al .",
    "we include the h@xmath16 emission line calculated from the model intrinsic star formation rate and extinction .",
    "the sed fitting method is the essentially the same as that by sawicki and yee ( 1998 ) . in the fitting",
    ", we fixed the redshift to be 4.8 .",
    "the resulting stellar masses , star formation ages , color excess , and star formation rates are presented in figure [ z5lbg ] ( left ) overlayed with those obtained for @xmath4 lbgs ( shapley et al .",
    "2001 ) and for @xmath20 lbgs ( shapley et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the rest - frame uv luminosity and optical luminosity of these samples are mostly overlapped each other .",
    "the stellar masses of the @xmath0 lbgs are significantly smaller than those at @xmath1 , and ages are smaller on average .",
    "these suggest the premature nature of the @xmath9 lbgs .",
    "stellar mass function and stellar mass density at @xmath0 are presented by yabe et al .",
    "( 2008 , this volume ) .",
    "as seen from figure [ z5lbg ] ( left ) , the star formation rates ( sfrs ) are systematically larger than those in @xmath1 lbgs .",
    "figure [ z5lbg ] ( right ) shows sfrs against their stellar masses for @xmath0 lbgs ( filled circles ) .",
    "the sfrs are very high amounting to several hundreds @xmath21 yr@xmath22 . these values are significantly larger than those seen in @xmath1 lbgs shown as open symbols in figure [ z5lbg ] ( right ) .",
    "they are also larger compared with the results for @xmath23 star forming galaxies ( e.g. , daddi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the specific star formation rates tend to decrease with decreasing redshift .",
    "it is suggested that the @xmath9 lbgs are in active star forming phase and have dusty environment .",
    "in fact , the color excesses obtained for the @xmath0 lbgs tend to be larger than those obtained for @xmath24 lbgs ( figure [ z5lbg](left ) ) .",
    "we may be witnessing an emergence of a population of active star forming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "if the @xmath0 lbgs keep the high sfrs , they should have stellar masses more than @xmath25 at @xmath4 .",
    "the distributions of the expected stellar masses at @xmath26 are shown as dotted lines in figure [ z5lbg](left ) , suggesting that the @xmath9 lbgs are not the progenitor of the @xmath24 lbgs or the large sfrs should decline . if the sfrs decline exponentially with a time scale of @xmath27 yr , sfrs should be very much small at @xmath4",
    ". thus the star formation may be episodic if the @xmath0 lbgs are the progenitor of @xmath4 lbgs . or they might be progenitor of passive massive galaxies at @xmath28",
    ".    however , as known well , there may be an age - extinction degeneracy in the sed fitting . because we do not have nir photometric data , our sed",
    "fitting may suffer from the degeneracy . to examine this , we made sed fitting for lbgs at @xmath9 sampled by stark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in which @xmath29 and @xmath30 photometry are available .",
    "we made sed fitting with and without @xmath29 and @xmath30 data .",
    "the resulting output parameters are shown in figure [ stark ] ( left ) .",
    "the stellar masses are robust as seen from the figure .",
    "the sfrs are also rather robust ( except for a few extraordinary cases ) , though the error bars are large",
    ". we also estimated the color excess using the method by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and found many of the objects have the color excesses consistent with the sed fitting .",
    "we also made various tests to see whether the large sfrs are due to some artificial causes .",
    "figure [ stark ] ( right ) shows output parameters of the sed fitting when we take redshift as a free parameter ( upper left panel ) , other star formation history ( upper right panel ) , metallicity ( lower left panel ) , and other extinction curves ( lower right panel ) . as seen from the panels , except for the adoption of other extinction curves , majority of estimated sfrs",
    "agree with those obtained in the fiducial model .",
    "no lbgs with large sfrs coincide with scuba sources ( pope et al .",
    "2005 ) , x - ray sources ( alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) , and vla sources ( richards 2000 ) .",
    "the estimated upper limits on sfrs from these surveys are @xmath31 yr@xmath22 .",
    "it is worth noting that many of these lbgs with large sfrs do not reside in the scuba / chandra surveys .",
    "further observations are necessary to definitively conclude the presence of such population .",
