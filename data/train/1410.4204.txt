    "after a decades - long hunt , in the summer of 2012 the physics world erupted in excitement when both the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern announced their discovery of a particle that looked like the higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . with the help of two - and - a - half times more data and sophisticated experimental analyses , it is now confirmed that the newfound particle behaves , indeed , very much like the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson . that this higgs boson decays to sm gauge bosons",
    "is now established with high statistical significance .",
    "in fact , each of the decay channels @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is by now a discovery channel .",
    "there is also good evidence of its non - universal couplings to fermions .",
    "the decays to @xmath4 and @xmath5 final states have also been seen with good confidence .",
    "since the higgs - boson mass ( @xmath6 ) has now been measured , its couplings to sm particles are completely predicted except for the residual arbitrariness introduced by the yukawa couplings to fermions , which are nevertheless very constrained by the precise measurement of fermion masses .",
    "this means that any deviation from the sm predictions will provide unambiguous evidence for new physics ( np ) .",
    "unfortunately , large deviations from the sm expectations are already ruled out ( except possibly in the couplings to light fermions and/or @xmath7 ) .",
    "this , in conjunction with the absence of any other direct np signal so far , leads us to expect a deviation at the level of no more than a few percents .",
    "hence , a rigorous study of the higgs - boson couplings in the run - ii of the lhc and also in the high luminosity phase is mandatory .",
    "although new particles at the tev scale or below are perfectly allowed by the lhc data , it is interesting to study the sensitivity of the current higgs - boson related measurements to short - distance physics assuming an effective field theory framework .",
    "the effect of heavy np ( beyond the reach of lhc for direct production ) can be parametrized in terms of gauge - invariant higher - dimensional operators involving only sm fields . in this case , one supplements the sm lagrangian with operators of mass dimension greater than 4 , @xmath8 in the sm there is only one operator of dimension 5 , the celebrated weinberg operator which gives majorana masses to light neutrinos @xcite . as this operator is irrelevant for our discussion of higgs physics , we will not consider it here . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of dimension-6 operators is much higher : even for one generation the count of the total number of operators grows to 59 @xcite .",
    "adding general flavour structure increases this number to a gigantic 2499 @xcite .",
    "for phenomenological explorations of some of these operators and related studies , see @xcite .    in the following section we will choose one operator basis and introduce the set of operators considered in this work .",
    "the experimental data used in our analysis will be discussed in sec .",
    "we will present our results in sec .",
    "[ results ] and outline some conluding remaks in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "several operator bases have been used in the literature to describe the physics of gauge - invariant dimension-6 operators in the sm @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on electroweak and higgs - boson observables only .",
    "while depending on the set of observables chosen for a specific study one of these operator bases can be more convenient than others , physics should be basis independent .",
    "moreover , we aim to study also other observables ( e.g. , flavour and other low - energy ones ) in the near future .",
    "therefore the choice of one operator basis is as good as any other one for our purpose . as we do not want to introduce another new basis in the literature , we choose to adopt the fairly general basis introduced in ref .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the total number of independent operators was shown to be 59 .",
    "the basis of ref .",
    "@xcite consists of 15 bosonic operators , 19 single - fermionic - current operators and 25 four - fermion operators for each fermion generation . since in this study",
    "we limit ourselves to electroweak and higgs - boson signal strength observables ( extending the previous work by some of us @xcite ) , we consider only a subset of operators . in particular , we only consider operators involving one or more higgs fields .",
    "operators which involve fermionic fields are assumed to be flavour - diagonal and family universal .",
    "moreover , we restrict this study to charge - parity ( @xmath9 ) even operators only . as the wilson coefficients are generated at the scale @xmath10 , ideally",
    ", one should also use the renormalization group equations ( rge ) to evolve them from the scale @xmath10 to the energy scale relevant for the process of interest . in this work we neglect the effect of rge .",
    "below , we introduce our notations and list all the operators relevant for our study .",
    "* bosonic operators : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the three pauli matrices .",
    "+ the wilson coefficients for the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( we denote them by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ) are related to the well known peskin and takeuchi parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite by , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the cosine and sine of the weak mixing angle @xmath22 respectively , @xmath23 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field and @xmath24 is the electromagnetic fine - structure constant .",
    "+ in addition to the above operators , there are two more purely bosonic operators involving only the higgs - boson field , namely , @xmath25 the operator @xmath26 contributes to the wave - function renormalization of the higgs field and @xmath27 contributes to the higgs potential , i.e. , the vev @xmath23 and the sm higgs - boson self coupling @xmath28 .",
    "we will see later that this makes @xmath26 poorly constrained and @xmath27 , which does not affect our observables at all , remains unconstrained by our analysis . a joint measurement of the higgs mass @xmath6 and the self - coupling @xmath28",
    "is required to constrain this operator .",
    "there are 8 more bosonic operators ( 6 @xmath9 odd + 2 @xmath9 even ) in the total 15 bosonic operators listed in @xcite , but they either do not involve any higgs field or are cp - odd .",
    "thus , we do not consider them in our analysis . *",
    "single - fermionic - current operators : @xmath29 % % % % % \\mathcal{o}_{hl}^{(3 ) } & =   ( h^\\dagger i \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu^i h ) ( \\overline{l}\\ , \\tau^i \\gamma^\\mu l ) \\ , \\ , , \\\\[1 mm ] % % % % % \\mathcal{o}_{he } & =   ( h^\\dagger i \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu h ) ( \\overline{e}_{r } \\gamma^\\mu e_{r } ) \\ , \\ , , \\\\[1 mm ] % % % % % \\mathcal{o}_{hq}^{(1 ) } & =   ( h^\\dagger i \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu h ) ( \\overline{q } \\gamma^\\mu q ) \\ , \\ , ,",

    "there are 8 more operator structures which involve tensor fermionic currents .",
    "we do not consider them in the analysis presented here .",
    "in order to constrain the wilson coefficients of the dimension-6 operators induced by np , we use the data on ( 1 ) electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) from sld , lep - i , lep - ii and tevatron and ( 2 ) higgs signal strengths from atlas and cms .",
    "the experimental values of the ewpo are summarized in table  [ data - ew ] .",
    ".summary of experimental data on ewpo .",
    "[ data - ew ] [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_hwb ] the posterior distribution of @xmath15 is shown with only ewpo and only higgs signal strength data .",
    "( [ hgaga ] ) also explains why the bounds on @xmath34 and @xmath35 are rather strong from the higgs signal strength data .",
    "the tight constraint on the operator @xmath36 can also be understood in a similar way .",
    "it contributes to the higgs - boson production through gluon fusion , @xmath37 which should be compared to the sm contribution @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the chromomagnetic fine - structure constant .",
    "the bounds on the dimension-6 operator coefficients in table [ res-1 ] can also be translated into bounds on the np scale for fixed values of the coefficients .",
    "we show them in table [ res-2 ] for two values , @xmath40 and @xmath41    a close look at the table [ res-2 ] will reveal that , assuming @xmath42 , the lower bound on the np scale for one of the operators that is constrained only by the higgs data ( @xmath43 ) is less than 1 tev .",
    "as this is close to the energy scale being probed at the lhc , the validity of such low bounds may be questionable .",
    "the discovery of a higgs boson and the absence of any other direct signal of new physics motivates to adopt effective field theories to study possible deviations of the higgs - boson couplings from the sm . in this work",
    "we have taken the above route to study the effects of dimension-6 operators in higgs physics . to this end , we have considered ewpo from lep and tevatron , and higgs signal strength date from the lhc to fit the coefficients of the np operators . in general , in an ultraviolet ( uv ) complete model several operators are generated with specific relations among their coefficients .",
    "however , given the state of our knowledge about uv physics , any theoretical bias is premature and considering definite combinations of the operators in a fit is not strongly motivated .",
    "here we have studied only one np operator at a time . barring accidental cancellations",
    ", our results should provide an estimate of the bounds even in relatively general scenarios .",
    "updated results including more than one operator at a time will be presented in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the summary of our results is presented in tables [ res-1 ] and [ res-2 ] .",
    "it is interesting that there is a strong hierarchy among the lower bounds on np scales of different operators .",
    "it spans from cases with @xmath44 1 tev ( @xmath43 ) to ( e.g. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "we observe that , except for the operator @xmath45 , the higgs strength data is redundant for all the operators which contribute to the ewpo .",
    "the bound from higgs data for the operator @xmath45 is comparable to that obtained from ewpo .",
    "however , there are also operators ( e.g. , @xmath46 ) which are only constrained by the higgs data . moreover , as some of them contribute to loop - suppressed processes in the sm , the bounds on them are rather strong .    to summarize , the preliminary results presented here indicate that the np scale is beyond the reach of lhc energy for most of the operators if the wilson coefficients are assumed to be @xmath47 . however , these bounds can be weaker if the coefficients are smaller or specific correlations among the np operators are present",
    ". therefore np scale of order @xmath44 tev is allowed for perturbative values of the couplings .",
