    "subfield of algebraic coding dominated the field of channel coding theory for the first couple of decades . in the @xmath0s ,",
    "the objective of most of the research in channel coding was the development of algebraic block codes , particularly cyclic codes .",
    "the main focus of algebraic coding theory is the design of @xmath1$]-codes that maximize the minimum distance @xmath2 for a given @xmath3 over a finite field @xmath4 .",
    "the algebraic coding paradigm used the structure of finite fields to design efficient encoding and error - correction procedures for linear block codes operating on a hard - decision channel .",
    "cyclic codes are codes that are invariant under cyclic shifts of @xmath5-tuple codewords",
    ". they were first investigated by prange in @xmath6  @xcite and became the primary focus of research after the publication of peterson s pioneering text in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "cyclic codes have a nice algebraic theory and attractive simple encoding and decoding procedures based on cyclic shift - register implementations .",
    "hamming , golay , and shortened reed - muller ( rm ) codes can be put into cyclic form .",
    "the main achievement in this field was the invention of bch and reed - solomon ( rs ) codes in @xmath8 and @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "even though , binary algebraic block codes can be used on the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , they have not proved to be the way to approach channel capacity on this channel .",
    "approaching the shannon limit on the awgn channel for an error - correction paradigm requires the operation of the decoder on the vector of _ soft decisions _ and minimizing the euclidean distance , rather than working on _ hard decisions _ and minimizing the hamming distance .",
    "it can be shown that using hard decisions generally costs @xmath9 to @xmath10db loss in the decoding performance .",
    "thus , in order to approach the shannon limit on the awgn channel , the error - correction paradigm of the algebraic coding must be modified to accommodate soft decisions .",
    "_ probabilistic coding _ is an alternative line of development , that was more directly inspired by shannon s probabilistic approach to coding . whereas the algebraic coding theory aims to find specific codes that maximize the minimum distance @xmath2 for a given @xmath3 , probabilistic coding is more concerned with finding the codes that optimize the average performance as a function of coding and decoding complexities .",
    "s doctoral thesis @xcite on low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes was motivated by the problem of finding a class of _ random - like _ codes that could be decoded near capacity with quasi - optimal performance and feasible complexity .",
    "gallager s ldpc codes and his iterative _ a posteriori probability _ ( app )",
    "decoding algorithm , which seems to have been the first appearance of the now - ubiquitous _ sum - product algorithm _",
    "( spa ) or _ belief propagation _ , were long before their time .",
    "ldpc codes were forgotten for more than @xmath11 years due to their high complexity for the technology of that time . in @xmath12 , mackay @xcite showed empirically that near - shannon - limit performance could be obtained with long ldpc codes and iterative decoding .",
    "however , even though ldpc codes have a good error performance in the awgn channel , their encoding complexity was a drawback for their implementation until the recent two decades and the invention of the _ quasi - cyclic _ ldpc ( qc - ldpc ) codes .",
    "it has been shown that qc - ldpc codes can perform as well as other types of ldpc codes in most of the applications @xcite .",
    "they have also been applied in the design of efficient multidimensional signal constellations for the awgn channels @xcite .",
    "qc - ldpc codes have advantages over other types of ldpc codes in hardware implementation of encoding @xcite and decoding @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , most of the ldpc codes adopted as standard codes for various next - generation communication and storage systems , are quasi - cyclic . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a method for encoding qc - ldpc codes with linear time and space complexities in the length of the code .",
    "these features have made the design of qc - ldpc codes an attractive research area and lots of methods , including algebraic methods , are proposed for constructing qc - ldpc codes . among these methods ,",
    "the methods based on finite fields are the most related ones to this paper  @xcite .",
    "looking at the evolution of channel coding theory , which can be found in the brilliant survey of costello and forney @xcite , reveals a trade off between the complexity of encoding in the transmitter and error performance of decoding in the receiver .",
    "indeed , if we want to have a low complexity encoding , the structure of the code must be close to the structure of the algebraic codes ( like cyclic codes ) and if we want to have a code with good error performance in the awgn channel , the structure of the code should be close to the structure of the capacity - approaching codes ( like ldpc codes ) . in this paper , we propose a family of codes that have both advantages at the same time .",
    "this family of codes can be obtained by group ring encodings , which are called _ group ring based codes _ through this paper .",
    "the codes from group ring encodings , which are presented in @xcite , are submodules ( sometimes ideals ) in a group ring .",
    "an isomorphism between a group ring and a certain subring of the matrices can be used to obtain the parity - check and the generator matrices of the codes directly from the elements of the group ring @xcite .",
    "the properties of the group ring based codes , such as the self - duality or owning a low density parity - check matrix , have simple algebraic descriptions .",
    "examples of ldpc and self - dual group ring based codes are presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new method for constructing and encoding qc - ldpc codes from group rings .",
    "we exploit the available implementations of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) over group rings @xcite to increase the efficiency of the proposed encoding method , compared to the existent encoding methods for qc - ldpc codes @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec2 ] gives a brief introduction to group rings and their matrix representation . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we present the design criteria for constructing the parity - check matrix of the qc - ldpc codes based on finite fields . in section  [ sec4 ] , we present the design criteria for constructing the parity - check matrix of the qc - ldpc codes from an element of a group algebra . in section  [ sec5 ]",
