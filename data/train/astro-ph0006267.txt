    "magnetic field passively advected by an incompressible velocity field obeys the induction equation @xmath4 where  @xmath5 is the diffusivity .",
    "we will assume that the diffusivity is negligibly small ( large prandtl number ) , and the magnetic field is therefore frozen into the fluid .",
    "the incompressibility of the velocity field is not relevant for further calculations ; for the compressible case , eq .",
    "( [ induction ] ) holds for  @xmath6 , where  @xmath7 is the density of the fluid .",
    "the random velocity field is assumed to be gaussian in the eulerian frame : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an arbitrary function regular at  @xmath10 , this is the so - called batchelor regime  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ induction ] ) is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are initial values of the fluid - particle coordinate and of the magnetic field .",
    "the object  @xmath14 in the integrand is the _",
    "lagrangian _ velocity field .",
    "the _ eulerian _",
    "velocity has the form  @xmath15 . to make use of the formula  ( [ correlator ] )",
    ", we need to  stop \" the moving point  @xmath16 in the function  @xmath17 .",
    "this is done differently in the eulerian and lagrangian frames  ( see fig.[trajectories ] ) .",
    "in the lagrangian frame ,  @xmath18 is fixed and we need to express  @xmath19 in terms of  @xmath20 .",
    "the general expression is  @xmath21 . for small  @xmath22",
    ", we expand this expression up to the second order in   @xmath23 , and iterate once with respect to  @xmath24 .",
    "we obtain    @xmath25    where all the velocities are taken at the point  @xmath18 , and we use the short - hand notation  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 .    to obtain the equation for the second moment of  @xmath28 , we substitute the expansion  ( [ velocity_expansion_lagrange ] ) into the formula  ( [ differential ] ) , raise the latter to the second power and average using formula  ( [ correlator ] ) .",
    "we assume that  @xmath22 is much smaller than the inverse growth rate of the second moment , and that the correlation time  @xmath29 is much smaller than  @xmath22 .",
    "assuming isotropic and spatially homogeneous initial distribution , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , we find the equation for the second - order moment  @xmath32 in the lagrangian frame .",
    "for the incompressible velocity field , it takes the form    @xmath33    to derive this equation we assumed that @xmath34 , where @xmath35  is a @xmath0  function smeared over the correlation time  @xmath29 . in particular , we have chosen the  box \" regularization :  @xmath36 for  @xmath37 $ ] , and  @xmath38 otherwise .",
    "the coefficients in the correction terms in the formula  ( [ growth_lagrangian ] ) are given by the following integrals :    @xmath39    all the derivatives of  @xmath40 in formula  ( [ growth_lagrangian ] ) are taken at  @xmath41 ; the subscripts denote derivatives with respect to the corresponding components of  @xmath42 , and  @xmath43 is the space dimension .",
    "one can easily check that the first - order @xmath29  correction to the growth rate is negative .",
    "it is important to note that this correction is not universal since the integrals  ( [ i_1]-[i_3 ] ) depend on the chosen regularization  @xmath35 of the @xmath0  function .",
    "in the eulerian frame , the point  @xmath44 is fixed in the formula  ( [ differential ] ) , and we need to express  @xmath45 in terms of  @xmath46 . by analogy with the expression  ( [ velocity_expansion_lagrange ] ) , we write  @xmath47 .",
    "the expansion now takes the form @xmath48 where we use the short - hand notation  @xmath49 . to calculate the second moment of  @xmath28",
    ", we have to use the expression  ( [ differential ] ) :    @xmath50    that should be expanded up to the fourth order in  @xmath51 .",
    "then , we substitute the expansion  ( [ velocity_expansion_euler ] ) for  @xmath52 .",
    "finally , assuming isotropic and spatially homogeneous initial distribution , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and making use of  ( [ correlator ] ) , we can find the equation for  @xmath53 .",
    "we do not present the detailed calculation here since for the incompressible velocity field , the answer coincides with the lagrangian case  ( [ growth_lagrangian ] ) , as it should .",
    "the appearance of the term  @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ growth_lagrangian ] ) shows that for the finite correlation time  @xmath29 , the velocity field  @xmath55 can not be treated as linear in the calculation of the growth rate .",
    "this is obvious since a lagrangian particle is swept by the finite distance  @xmath56 before the velocity field becomes decorrelated .",
    "the appearance of  @xmath57 ( or , equivalently ,  @xmath58 ) is a manifestation of the absence of the galilean invariance . for the velocity field with finite correlation time ,",
    "such invariance is broken as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) .",
    "the batchelor advection , i.e. the advection by a smooth velocity field is a good model for many physical problems .",
    "it is usually a valid approximation when one is interested in the correlators of the advected fields on the scales @xmath59 that are much smaller than the viscous scale of the velocity field  @xmath60 .",
    "an additional simplification arises when the correlation time of the velocity field  @xmath29 is much smaller than the inverse growth rates of the advected fields .",
    "mathematically , such a limit is described by the @xmath0-correlated in time velocity field .",
    "in such a case , the growth rates depend only on  @xmath61 , as a consequence of the scale invariance . in this case one can substitute the linear velocity field  @xmath62 , @xmath63 , for the real field , and thus reduce the field - theoretical problem to the quantum mechanics of the fluctuating matrix  @xmath64(t ) ; for details and references , see  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the possibility of such a reduction is an artifact of the @xmath0-correlated velocity field , and have presented a simple method for calculating the finite - time corrections to the growth rates .",
    "the criterion of the applicability of the quantum mechanical reduction is not only @xmath65 , but also  @xmath66 . for  @xmath67 ,",
    "the universal growth rates do not exist , they are determined by the statistics of the velocity field on the integral scale and by the form of the short - time regularization .",
    "this fact is sometimes overlooked in the literature ; in the present note we have tried to clarify the question .",
    "the general formalism allowing to systematically find the finite - time corrections to the dynamo growth rates , has been developed in  @xcite by a different method .",
    "a simple discussion of the stochastic calculus applied to the dynamo problem can be found in  @xcite ."
