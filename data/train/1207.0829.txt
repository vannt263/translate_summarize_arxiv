    "the study of the interactions which underlie the magnetic ground state of deposited nanostructures constitutes an area of enormous interest nowadays , both , in applied and in basic research .",
    "the systems of interest can be atomically manipulated and deposited on different substrates by means of scanning tunneling microcopy ( stm ) . for future spintronic applications",
    "the search is , among others , towards adequate films able to decouple the deposited nanostructures from the underlying metallic substrate , diminishing as much as possible the influence of the latter on the electronic and magnetic properties of adsorbed nano - objects .",
    "actually , isolation is never complete and , the decoupling layers themselves play , in principle , a role to be determined on the magnetic interactions of the nanostructures .",
    "copper nitride overlayers grown on different cu surfaces have been recently used as decoupling systems , being it possible to develop stable thin films even at the monolayer thickness , while preserving an ordered geometric structure . actually , the number of systems which fulfill these conditions seems to be limited and , thereafter , copper nitride monolayers , called from now on cu@xmath1n , are currently being investigated both theoretically as experimentally.@xcite    focusing on the magnetic interactions within the nanostructures , mn chains of different lengths have been deposited by hirjibehedin _",
    "@xcite on cu@xmath1n / cu(001 ) at different adsorption sites by doing manipulation with an stm .",
    "performing inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) the authors concluded that the interatomic mn - mn interactions are antiferromagnetic with an interaction strength which depends on the deposition configuration .",
    "there have been different theoretical contributions addressing these interactions.@xcite in particular , in previous works we have studied the effect of the surrounding geometry on the magnetic interatomic interactions for mn and cr chains deposited on cu@xmath1n / cu(001).@xcite    recently the group of r. wiesendanger has proposed to make use of the rkky interaction among fe adatoms deposited on a non magnetic metallic susbstrate , namely , the ( 111 ) surface of a copper monocrystal , to fabricate spin - based logic devices.@xcite in fact , this group has achieved it to realize and develop a model system able to perform logic operations .",
    "the tip of an stm was used to deposit chains of antiferromagnetically coupled fe adatoms and , using spin polarized scanning - tunneling spectroscopy ( sp - sts ) , the magnetic interaction among the spins of the deposited adatoms was measured .",
    "the designed model device was able to transmit and process certain desired magnetic information .",
    "the authors suggest that combinations of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetically coupled chains could be used to realize new model gates by properly tuning the interatomic distances of the adsorbed atoms .    in this contribution",
    "we show that using covalent decoupling layers , such as the cu@xmath1n monolayers grown on cu(001 ) , it is possible to obtain different intrachain magnetic interactions for an adsorbed @xmath0 atomic chain with a given @xmath2 filling .",
    "this can be achieved not by tuning the interatomic distance of the adsorbed nanostructures but , by changing the adsorption sites of the transition metal atoms , which could be part of an eventual spintronic device .",
    "the richness provided by the molecular substrate lies in the fact that the interatomic interactions within the deposited chains can change dramatically not only as a funtion of @xmath2-filling but also depending on adsorption configuration , while keeping the distance among chain atoms fixed .",
    "we present the results of a systematic study of the behaviour of the magnetic interactions within cr , mn , fe and co chains deposited on the above mentioned molecular system . four different chain adsorption geometries are considered , geometries which involve different magnetic mediation processes , with the aim of highlighting the effect of the local and crystal environment on the interacting @xmath0 orbitals of the chains .",
    "we find that the adsorption sites of the chain atoms on the decoupling layer determine the kind of magnetic interaction involved , while the filling of the @xmath2-orbitals determines the final magnetic ground state .",
    "we perform _ ab initio _ calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) using the full potential linearized augmented plane waves method ( fp - lapw ) , as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange and correlation potential in the parametrization of perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite and the augmented plane wave - local orbital ( apw - lo ) basis are used . the cutoff parameter which gives the number of plane waves in the interstitial region",
    "is taken as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the value of the largest reciprocal lattice vector used in the plane waves expansion and @xmath5 is the smallest _ muffin tin _ radio used .",
    "the number of @xmath6 points in the brillouin zone is enough in each case to obtain the desired energy and charge precision , namely @xmath7 ry and @xmath7 e respectively .",
    "the nitrogen atoms of the pristine substrate occupy fourfold coordinated hollow sites on the outermost metallic copper layer , forming a c(2x2 ) local structure.@xcite this structure forms islands on the cu(001 ) surface and , as mentioned in the introduction , the chains are built atom by atom on one of these cu@xmath1n islands .",
    "we simulate an island by considering a cu@xmath1n monolayer on cu(001 ) .",
    "this system is modeled with a supercell composed by a five layers slab separated by a vacuum region of 13.8  .",
    "the thickness of the vacuum region is found to be sufficiently large to avoid interactions among subsequent slabs . to exploit inversion symmetry and to prevent unphysical multipoles , each slab has one cu@xmath1n monolayer on each side .",
    "the surface lattice constant follows pseudomorphically the underlying cu(001 ) substrate and we use the experimental lattice constant of copper .",
    "we consider that the adsorbed 3@xmath2 atomic chains are infinite long and they are deposited on both sides of the slabs .",
    "the nearest neighbour 3@xmath2 - 3@xmath2 distance along the chains is 3.61   in all the cases studied . in these supercell calculations , chains",
    "are periodically arranged 7.2   apart from each other assuming that the interchain interactions are much smaller than the intrachain ones .",
    "the positions of all atoms in the supercell of the proposed systems are allowed to move until forces are smaller than 0.1 ev /  .",
    "for cr , mn , fe and co chains , we consider four different stable adsorption geometries .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) displays a schematic top view of the cu@xmath1n / cu(001 ) substrate , while the different geometric chain configurations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( b - e ) .    in the first adsorption geometry ,",
    "the 3@xmath2 chains are arranged directly on top of cu atoms of the cu@xmath1n monolayer , in such a way that one n atom of the nitride lies inbetween each pair of @xmath0 atoms along the chain .",
    "there are four lateral copper atoms of the cu@xmath1n monolayer surrounding each chain atom .",
    "this is one of the experimentally reported situations@xcite and we call it _",
    "s1_. see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) .    in the second geometry , _ s2 _ , each atom of the chain is deposited , as in the case of _",
    "s1 _ , on top of cu atoms but",
    "now every chain atom is laterally surrounded by two nitrogens , one at each side in the direction perpendicular to the chain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) .",
    "there are also four lateral copper atoms of the cu@xmath1n substrate surrounding each chain atom .    in the third case , called the _",
    "s3 _ arrangement , the 3@xmath2 atoms are located in hollow sites of the cu@xmath1n layer , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](d ) .",
    "there are four surface cu atoms and four nitrogens around each 3@xmath2 one .",
    "the last configuration considered , the _ s4 _ , is one in which the 3@xmath2 atoms sit on top of nitrogens of the substrate as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( e ) .",
    "each 3@xmath2 atom is surrounded by four coppers of the underlying substrate . this configuration has also been experimentally reported .",
    "@xcite    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     all the electronic density plots shown in this work are for mn chains , but no relevant differences are observed for the other @xmath2 fillings .    summarizing in _ s1 _ , _",
    "s2 _ and _ s4 _ the 3@xmath2 atoms of the chains are covalently bonded to their nearest neighbor nitrogen atoms , but , in _",
    "s1 _ the chain binds metalically to the substrate , while in _ s2 _ and _ s4 _ it does it covalently . on the other hand , in _",
    "the 3@xmath2 chain is metalically bonded to the cu@xmath1n substrate .",
    "as stated in the introduction , among the possible magnetic solutions , we consider only collinear ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ones for each atomic adsorption configuration .",
    "we are aware of the fact that in those cases in which the difference in energy between the fm and afm magnetic order is small , other interactions could turn out being important and that the ground state might be non collinear , but , in this work we are mainly concerned with general trends .    in order to analyse the evolution of the magnetic ground state as a function of @xmath2 band filling and adsorption sites of the chains , we calculate the difference in energy , @xmath8 , between the afm and fm configurations for all the arrangements .",
    "if this difference is negative the magnetic ground state is afm , if not , it is fm . the results obtained for _ s1 _ , _",
    "s2 _ , _ s3 _ and _ s4 _ appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] . as it can be seen _",
    "s1 _ has a completely different magnetic behaviour than the other three configurations . in _",
    "s1 _ the magnetic interaction goes from fm to afm with increasing @xmath2 filling , while the reverse is observed for _",
    "s2 _ and _ s4 _ , both , presenting similar trends .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in the _ s2 _ and _ s4 _ arrangements the 3@xmath2 atoms are covalently bonded to neighboring nitrogens , but in _ s1 _ there is a nitrogen atom inbetween two 3@xmath2 ones .",
    "the nitrogen atom in the diatomic chain gives rise to a superexchange like magnetic coupling among the 3@xmath2 atoms .",
    "this kind of adsorption situation , which enables this nitrogen mediated interaction , has already been treated in the literature for mn chains and for several dimers.@xcite    in _ s2 _ and _ s4 _ the atoms of the 3@xmath2 chains are covalently bonded to the substrate through their neighboring nitrogen atoms and in both cases the magnetic ground states go from afm to fm as a function of @xmath2 filling .",
    "there is a direct exchange interaction along the chains and an indirect interaction through the substrate .",
    "the question is which is more significant .",
    "if one compares the results for @xmath8 obtained in the case of the _ s2 _ and _ s4 _ configurations with those corresponding to the unsupported chains at the same interatomic distance , _ s6 _ , the same trends for the magnetic interaction are found as a function of @xmath2 filling .",
    "the energy differences between ferro- and antiferromagnetic configurations are also of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the results for @xmath8 for the unsupported chains together with those corresponding to _ s2 _ and _ s4 _ are presented in fig  [ fig : fig11 ] ( c ) .",
    "these results show that the direct interaction among the 3@xmath2 atoms is comparable in the three cases .",
    "this is also apparent from the comparison of the electronic density plots of fig  [ fig : fig6 ] ( a ) and fig  [ fig : fig10 ] ( a ) with that of an unsupported chain at the same interatomic distance .",
    "the indirect interaction through the substrate is certainly affecting the energy difference for each particular filling , giving rise to a switching of the solution from fm to afm in the case of mn . in the case of mn",
    "the direct interaction is small and competes with the other interactions at the considered interatomic distance , but it does not change the general trends .    finally , _",
    "s3 _ presents a different behavior as a function of @xmath2 filling when compared with the other configurations and the results for @xmath8 point towards the preponderance of another type of magnetic interaction .",
    "the difference in energy @xmath8 , in this case , evolves as if the chains were adsorbed directly on hollow sites of cu(001 ) , that is , the so called _ s5 _ configuration .",
    "this is clear from fig  [ fig : fig11 ] ( b ) where we compare @xmath8 for _ s3 _ and _ s5 _ and from which it is seen that the order of magnitude and the sign of @xmath8 is the same for the four @xmath2 filling studied . in the _ s3 _ arrangement",
    "the interaction among atoms of the 3@xmath2 chains seems to be predominantly rkky - like , as it is the case when 3@xmath2 atoms are directly adsorbed on cu(111).@xcite    it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained for the exchange coupling among ti atoms in ref .   when depositing a monolayer of titanium on the same cu2n / cu(001)surface .",
    "the coupling obtained by the authors along an n axis and along a hollow axis are to be compared with the exchange energies obtained by us in the _ s1 _ and _ s2 _ configurations of the deposited chains . following the trends already discussed , for ti chains in the _ s1 _ and _ s2 _ configurations we would have obtained also ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange couplings , respectively .",
    "we have repeated the calculations within the dft+u framework@xcite using @xmath9 ev for cr and mn and @xmath10 for fe and co. the results obtained for @xmath8 do no change the general trends obtained .",
    "summarizing , the covalently bonded nitride substrate cu@xmath1n offers an interesting template to taylor magnetic interactions among transition metal atoms by taking as variable the adsorption sites .",
    "we have shown this by depositing @xmath0 chains on four different adsorption sites with the same interatomic distance among 3@xmath2 atoms and for four different @xmath2 fillings . due to the different type of bonding present , we obtain that the @xmath0 atoms interact magnetically through completely different mechanisms depending on adsorption geometry . for a given @xmath2 filling , the interaction can be strongly afm or fm for the same interatomic distance along the chain",
    ". this versatility could be very promising regarding the future possibility of making spin engineering at the nanometer scale .",
    "we expect a similar richness in the magnetic interactions , when using other covalently bonded substrates .",
