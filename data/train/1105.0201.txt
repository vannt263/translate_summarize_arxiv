    "let @xmath0 be a differentiable manifold with a symmetric inner product structure , named metric , on its tangent bundle .",
    "if the metric is nondegenerate , we can construct in a canonical way a levi - civita connection and the riemann , ricci and scalar curvatures .",
    "if the metric is allowed to be degenerate ( hence @xmath0 is a singular semiriemannian manifold ) , some obstructions prevented the construction of such invariants .",
    "degenerate metrics are useful because they can arise in various contexts in which semiriemannian manifolds are used .",
    "they are encountered even in manifolds with nondegenerate ( but indefinite ) metric , because the metric induced on a submanifold can be degenerate .",
    "the properties of such submanifolds were studied _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite , @xcite .    in general relativity , there are models or situations when the metric becomes degenerate or changes its signature . as the penrose and hawking _ singularity theorems _",
    "@xcite show , einstein s equation leads to singularities under very general conditions , apparently similar to the matter distribution in our universe .",
    "therefore , many attempts were done to deal with such singularities .",
    "for example it was suggested that ashtekar s method of `` new variables '' @xcite can be used to pass beyond the singularities , because the variable @xmath1  a densitized frame of vector fields  defines the metric , which can be degenerate .",
    "unfortunately , it turned out that in this case the connection variable @xmath2 may become singular _ cf . _ _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .    in some cosmological models",
    "the initial singularity of the big bang is eliminated by making the metric riemannian for the early universe .",
    "the metric changes the signature when traversing a hypersurface , becoming lorentzian , so that time emerges from a space dimension .",
    "some particular junction conditions were studied ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite _ etc . _ ) .    other situation where the metric can become degenerate was proposed by einstein and rosen , as a model of charged particles @xcite .",
    "all these applications in geometry and general relativity demand a generalization of the standard methods of semiriemannian geometry , to cover the degenerate case . a degenerate metric",
    "prevents the standard constructions like covariant derivative and curvature .",
    "manifolds endowed with degenerate metrics were studied by moisil @xcite , strubecker @xcite , vrnceanu @xcite .",
    "notable is the work of kupeli @xcite , which is limited to the constant signature case .",
    "the purpose of this article twofold :    1 .   to provide a toolbox of geometric invariants , which extend the standard constructions from semiriemannian geometry to the nondegenerate case , with constant or variable signature , 2 .   and to apply these constructions to extend einstein s equation to a class of singular spacetimes .",
    "the first goal of this article is to construct canonical invariants such as the covariant derivative and riemann curvature tensor , in the case of singular semiriemannian geometry .",
    "the main obstruction for this is the fact that when the metric is nondegenerate , it does nt admit an inverse .",
    "this prohibits operations like index raising and contractions between covariant indices .",
    "this prevents the definition of a levi - civita connection , and by this , the construction of the curvature invariants .",
    "this article presents a way to construct such invariants even if the metric is degenerate , for a class of singular semiriemannian manifolds which are named _",
    "semiregular_.    the second goal is to apply the tools developed here to write a densitized version of einstein s tensor which remains smooth in the presence of singularities , if the spacetime is semiregular .",
    "consequently , we can write a version of einstein s equation which is equivalent to the standard one if the metric is nondegenerate . this allows us to extend smoothly the equations of general relativity beyond the apparent limits imposed by the singularity theorems of penrose and hawking @xcite",

    "shows how we can contract covariant indices of tensor fields , so long as these indices are radicalannihilators .",
    "normally , the levi - civita connection is obtained by raising an index of the right member of the koszul formula ( named here koszul form ) , operation which is not available when the metric is degenerate . section ",
    "[ s_koszul_form ] studies the properties of the koszul form , which are similar to those of the levi - civita connection .",
    "this allows us to construct in section  [ s_cov_der ] a sort of covariant derivative for vector fields , and in  [ s_cov_der_covect ] a covariant derivative for differential forms .",
    "the notion of semiregular semiriemannian manifold is defined in section  [ s_riemann_curvature ] as a special type of singular semiriemannian manifold with variable signature on which the lower covariant derivative of any vector field , which is a @xmath3-form , admits smooth covariant derivatives .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor is constructed in  [ s_riemann_curvature ] with the help of the koszul form and of the covariant derivative for differential forms introduced in section  [ s_cov_der ] . for semiregular semiriemannian manifolds ,",
    "the riemann curvature tensor is shown to be smooth , and to have the same symmetry properties as in the nondegenerate case .",
    "in addition , it is radicalannihilator in all of its indices , this allowing the construction of the ricci and scalar curvatures .",
    "then , in section",
    " [ s_riemann_curvature_ii ] , the riemann curvature tensor is expressed directly in terms of the koszul form , obtaining an useful formula .",
