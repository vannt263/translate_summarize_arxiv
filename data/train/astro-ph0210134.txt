    "2001 ) , suggests that the bulk of the total energy density of the universe is in the form of some exotic dark energy with a negative equation of state .",
    "one of the primary objectives of cosmology today is to uncover the origin and nature of this dark energy .",
    "a possible candidate for the dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath5 , with an equation of state @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the pressure and @xmath21 is the energy density of the dark energy ) strictly equal to @xmath22 .",
    "another possibility , and one that may find favor from a particle - physics point of view , is a dynamical scalar field , termed quintessence , @xmath23 . unlike the cosmological constant , the @xmath23-component is both time - dependent and spatially inhomogeneous with an equation of state @xmath24 that is likely to be redshift dependent .",
    "determining the value of @xmath1 and how it changes with time are key to constraining the nature of the dark energy .    while the accelerating expansion implies only that @xmath25 , combinations of cmb data , snia data , and large - scale - structure data suggest that @xmath1 is most likely in the range @xmath26 ( wang et al . 2000 , huterer & turner 2001 , bean & melchiorri 2002 , baccigalupi et al .",
    "though combining these different data sets have provided some constraint on @xmath1 , how @xmath1 should vary with redshift is largely unknown .",
    "particle physics offer several possible functional forms for the quintessence field s potential @xmath27 and hence possible scenarios for the time history of @xmath1 . nonetheless , determining @xmath1 s redshift evolution observationally is likely to be very challenging ( barger & marfatia 2001 , maor et al .",

    "appear , however , to be attainable goals within the near future .",
    "since the dark - energy dynamics influences both the evolution of the background cosmology and the growth of structure , it directly affects many observables .",
    "its modification of the angular - diameter distance , the luminosity distance , and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum , are the primary sources of dark - energy constraint in measurements of cmb anisotropies , snia , and local cluster abundances , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we consider another possible means of constraining @xmath1 : measurement of weak gravitational - lens abundances .",
    "weak lensing ",
    "the weak distortion of background - galaxy images due to the deep gravitational potential of an intervening overdensity provides a powerful technique for mapping the distribution of matter in the universe ( see reviews by bartelmann & schneider 2001 , mellier 1999 ) .",
    "here we study the impact of the dark energy on the predicted redshift distribution and sky density of weak lenses .",
    "dark energy affects the abundance of weak lenses by not only modifying the distance - redshift relation and the matter power spectrum but also by altering the rate of structure growth .",
    "in particular , the larger @xmath1 is the faster and earlier objects collapse .",
    "an interesting consequences of this is that if we separate weak lenses into the two observational classes  those that have collapsed and reached virial equilibrium and are therefore x - ray luminous and those that are non - virialized and hence x - ray underluminous ( weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 ; hereafter wk02)the abundance of one class evolves slightly differently from the other",
    ". therefore the relative fraction of these two types of lenses varies with @xmath1 .",
    "this observable is especially promising as compared to measurements of absolute abundances because it is less sensitive to uncertainties in both the cosmological parameters and the noise in the lensing map .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the weak - lensing signal - to - noise estimator and discuss how we determine the mass- and redshift - dependent minimum overdensity required to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the spherical - collapse model in quintessence cosmologies .",
    "we provide fitting formulas for the non - linear overdensity at virialization and the linear - theory density at collapse and describe our approach to normalizing the matter power spectrum . in section 4",
    "we show the resulting effect the dark energy has on the weak - lens abundances and in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "finally , we note that a similar analysis has recently been performed by bartelmann , perrotta & baccigalupi ( 2002 ) , although not for the case of non - virialized lenses .",
    "although we agree with their general conclusion that the weak lens abundance is a potentially sensitive probe of the dark energy , our results differ from their results in important details .",
    "we discuss these differences in section 4.2 .",
    "in order to compute the abundance of weak gravitational lenses for dark - energy cosmologies we must first determine the necessary conditions for a halo of a given density profile and redshift to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal .",
    "of course the more overdense a halo is relative to the background density the more it coherently distorts the nearby background galaxies and hence the stronger its lensing signal .",
    "the detectability of this signal is hampered , however , by noise in the weak - lensing map , primary of which is the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the background galaxies .",
    "the goal is therefore to determine the minimum overdensity a halo must have such that it produces a sufficiently large signal relative to the noise so as to be detectable .",
    "a convenient method for computing this minimum overdensity is provided by schneider s ( 1996 ) aperture - mass technique .",
    "consider a lens at redshift @xmath28 of surface mass density @xmath29 within an angular radius @xmath30 .",
    "for a source at redshift @xmath31 the convergence @xmath32 is given by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the angular - diameter distances between the lens and the observer , the source galaxy and the observer , and the lens and the source , respectively .",

    "kruse & schneider 1999 ) that the dispersion @xmath61 of @xmath42 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number density of galaxy images and @xmath64 is the dispersion in the galaxies intrinsic ellipticity . in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath65 arcmin@xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath68 within an aperture radius @xmath37 is then given by , @xmath69    the tangential shear at @xmath30 , @xmath70 , depends on the amplitude and shape of the lensing halo s density profile .",

    "we describe the mass density of lensing halos with the universal density profile introduced by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ; 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) .",
    "thus , for an nfw halo at a given redshift with a given mass and mean overdensity relative to the background ( @xmath74 ) , we can solve for the parameters of the profile ( i.e. , the scale radius and the scale density ) and obtain an estimate of @xmath70 .",
    "details of how we solve for the nfw - profile parameters are given in the appendix of wk02 .",
    "with the density profile known we can determine , using equation ( 12 ) , the expected value of @xmath68 .",
    "the minimum mean overdensity , @xmath75 , needed to produce a detectable lens is then given by that overdensity for which @xmath76 . in this paper we assume @xmath77 and @xmath78 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "according to the spherical model of gravitational collapse a density perturbation with a nonlinear overdensity @xmath79 corresponds to a particular position along the linear - theory evolutionary cycle .",
    "thus the minimum nonlinear overdensity @xmath75 described above corresponds to a minimum linear - theory overdensity @xmath80 ; if an object of mass @xmath81 at redshift @xmath82 has a linear - theory overdensity @xmath83 , then it is sufficiently overdense to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal . by determining @xmath80 from the computed @xmath75 we can apply the press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory to calculate the number of halos per unit mass and redshift with @xmath84 and hence @xmath76 .",
    "we can then find the redshift distribution and sky density of weak lenses and how these observables vary with @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that for a broad range of dark - energy cosmologies a substantial fraction of detectable weak gravitational lenses have @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the critical density threshold for collapse . those objects with @xmath87 are commonly thought to be density perturbations that have not yet reached virialization and are therefore expected to have observational properties that are very different from typical virialized lensing clusters .",
    "in this section , we present the approach used to map the minimum nonlinear overdensity @xmath75 to a minimum linear - theory overdensity @xmath80 for quintessence models ( qcdm ) .",
    "we describe the dynamical equations of gravitational collapse in qcdm and give fitting formulas for the nonlinear overdensity at virialization , @xmath88 , and the critical density @xmath86 .",
    "we then discuss how we calculate the abundances of weak gravitational lenses , both those with @xmath87 and those with @xmath89 .",
    "below we assume a flat cosmology with a hubble parameter @xmath90 , a spectral index @xmath91 , a baryon density @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , unless stated otherwise .      in quintessence",
    "the dark energy is a dynamical , time - dependent component , q , with an equation of state parametrized by @xmath94 , the pressure divided by the energy density .",
    "the evolution of the energy density with the cosmological scale factor goes as @xmath95 , so that for @xmath6 the standard cosmological - constant model , @xmath5cdm , is recovered .",
    "current observational evidence can not yet rule out a @xmath1 in the range @xmath96 .    in order to relate a nonlinear overdensity to a linear - theory overdensity in qcdm",
    "we must first solve for the evolution of the overdensity s radius , @xmath97 , with time .",
    "for a spherical overdensity patch with uniform matter density @xmath98 the evolution is described by the momentum component of the einstein equations ( wang & steinhardt 1998 ; hereafter ws98 ) : @xmath99.\\ ] ] as ws98 pointed out , for @xmath100 the space curvature @xmath101 inside the overdensity patch is time dependent .",
    "physically , this is because the evolution of the energy density in the @xmath23 component is evolving independently of the change in radius of the overdensity patch . as a result",
    ", one can not assume that within the collapsing overdensity the rate of change of the internal energy in the q - component , @xmath102 , equals the rate of work done by the q - component .",
    "that is , because @xmath103 is nonzero unless the q - component is the cosmological constant , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the volume of the overdensity patch .",
    "therefore equation ( 13 ) can not be cast in the form of a first order differential equation as is often done when going from an acceleration equation to a friedman - like energy equation . assuming a constant @xmath101 , as was done in the version 1 preprint of okas & hoffman ( 2001 ) , yields significantly different solutions for the evolution of the radius , @xmath106 , and hence for @xmath88 and @xmath86 .    if we combine equation ( 13 ) with the friedman equation for the background , @xmath107 and impose the boundary conditions @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the scale factor at turn - around , then for a spherical density perturbation with a given @xmath79 and redshift @xmath82 , the unique temporal evolution of the overdensity , from linearity to nonlinearity , can be solved ( cf .",
    ", appendix a in ws98 ) .",
    "we then have a one - to - one map from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , as shown in figure 1 for the cases @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the map has a mild @xmath1 dependence , with a given @xmath115 corresponding to a slightly larger @xmath79 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this is a consequence of the earlier formation of structure in qcdm models relative to @xmath5cdm models ; overdensities collapse faster and are therefore more concentrated for @xmath24 .",
    "this point is well illustrated in figure 2 where we show the growth of a spherical perturbation for the same quintessence models .",
    "as expected , the larger @xmath1 is , the earlier structures reach turnaround and collapse .",
    "it can be shown that in the limit @xmath116 the spherical - collapse model predicts that the radius , @xmath97 , of the overdensity goes to zero and hence @xmath117 .",
    "of course well before reaching the singular solution an actual overdensity will virialize , thereby halting its collapse . to account for this fact we invoke a simple smoothing scheme in which the radius of the matter perturbation is constant with time upon reaching the virialized overdensity ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to wk02 for details of the smoothing method .    as described in ws98 , the value of @xmath88 for quintessence models , needed here in order to implement the smoothing scheme ,",
    "can be obtained via the virial theorem , energy conservation , and solving equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) for the overdensity at turnaround . in figure 3",
    "we show the resulting numerical solution to @xmath88 .",
    "we find that an accurate fitting function to @xmath88 for @xmath118 , modeled after the approximation given in kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) for a @xmath5cdm cosmology , is @xmath119,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "since structures start to form earlier the larger @xmath1 is , the mean gas temperature in collapsing objects is higher in larger-@xmath1 models . as a result , a greater overdensity is required in order for such objects to become bound and virialized , explaining why @xmath122 rises with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath123 the map from nonlinear to linear overdensity has a weak dependence on not only @xmath1 but on @xmath2 and redshift as well .",
    "the critical threshold for collapse today @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the linear growth factor ( see ws98 ) , also has a weak dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath1 , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "for @xmath126 and @xmath118 , we find that an accurate fitting function to @xmath127 , also modeled after the approximation given in kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) for a @xmath5cdm cosmology , is @xmath128 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\alpha & = & 0.353 w^4   +   1.044 w^3   +   1.128 w^2 \\nonumber",

    "as we showed in wk02 , both lens types are cluster - mass overdensities .",
    "however , while the virialized lenses are typically virialized clusters that form at rare ( e.g. , @xmath135 ) high - density peaks of a gaussian primordial distribution , the non - virialized lenses correspond to proto - clusters ( e.g. , @xmath136 peaks)mass overdensities that have not yet undergone gravitational collapse and virialized , but which have begun to break away from the cosmological expansion .",
    "these proto - clusters should contain galaxies and perhaps a few groups that later merge to form the cluster ( cf .",
    ", white et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the timescale for collapse of cluster - mass objects is large , and the overdensities can be very large even before they have virialized",
    ". it should therefore not be too surprising that proto - clusters produce a weak - lensing signal that resembles that from virialized clusters .",
    "though the lensing signals may be similar , the two lens types are expected to have different observational features . in particular , since the x - ray luminosity is a very rapidly varying function of the virialized mass , the summed x - ray emission from a non - virialized lens should be much smaller than that from a fully virialized lensing cluster of the same mass . in referring to these proto - clusters as `` dark '' , we thus mean that they should be x - ray underluminous .",
    "although the mass - to - light ratio of these clusters should be comparable to those for ordinary clusters , since ( 1 ) high - redshift clusters may be difficult to pick out in galaxy surveys and , ( 2 ) proto - clusters will typically have a sky density a few times smaller than ordinary clusters , it would also not be surprising if these dark lenses had no readily apparent corresponding galaxy overdensity .",
    "observational evidence of such dark lenses has been reported in detections by erben et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , umetsu & futamase ( 2000 ) , miralles et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , dahle et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , the latter involving a detection through strong , rather than weak , lensing . a more detailed discussion of the features that may distinguish dark and virialized weak lenses is given in wk02 .",
    "in order to compute the abundances of virialized and dark lenses we need to know the probability that an object of a given mass at a given redshift is in one of the above mentioned ranges in overdensity .",
    "if we assume gaussian statistics for the initial linear - theory density field , then the probability that an object s overdensity is in the range @xmath137 is @xmath138 where ` erf ' is the error function , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 is the rms density fluctuation of an object of mass @xmath81 at redshift @xmath82 . from press - schechter theory ,",
    "we know that the comoving number density of virialized objects ( those with @xmath141 ) of mass @xmath142 in the interval @xmath143 that are at redshift @xmath82 in a universe with comoving background density @xmath144 is , @xmath145.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can therefore compute the abundance of objects in the overdensity range @xmath137 by convolving the above mass function of virialized objects with @xmath146 . specifically , the fraction of objects that can lens relative to those that are virialized is , for dark lenses , @xmath147 and for virialized lenses , @xmath148 as noted in wk02 , the lower the mass of the object the larger the minimum overdensity needed to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal . for low enough masses the minimum overdensity becomes so large that both @xmath149 and @xmath150 approach zero , thereby imposing an effective weak - lensing mass threshold .",
    "given @xmath151 and equation ( 20 ) we can compute the total comoving number density of weak lenses of a particular type . multiplying by the comoving volume element @xmath152 then gives the differential number count of lensing objects per steradian , per unit redshift interval : @xmath153 by integrating over redshift we can then compute the number of dark and virialized lenses we expect to see per unit area of sky for a given qcdm model .      in equation (",
    "23 ) the volume term and the two terms within the integrand are all functions of @xmath1 . while the predicted abundance of weak lenses will therefore vary with @xmath1 , the degree to which it will vary depends on the shape and normalization of the power spectrum of density fluctuations . in particular , to compute the abundance of weak - lenses we need to know @xmath154 .    for the _ shape _ of the power spectrum we use the fitting formulas given in ma et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for qcdm models with the transfer function and shape parameter for @xmath5cdm models given by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and hu & sugiyama ( 1996 , eqs .",
    "[ d-28 ] and [ e-12 ] ) , respectively .",
    "since the q - component does not cluster on scales less than @xmath155 mpc ( caldwell , dave & steinhardt 1998 ) , at the weak - lensing scales the shape of the spectrum does not differ significantly from the well studied @xmath5cdm shape .",
    "the _ normalization _ of the power spectrum , often expressed in terms of @xmath156 , the rms fluctuation today at a scale of 8 @xmath157 mpc , is not as well constrained as its shape and will in general be a function of @xmath1 .",
    "there are two different methods commonly used to obtain the normalization : to fix it by the observed x - ray cluster abundance or to fix it by the cmb large - scale anisotropies observed by the cobe satellite .",
    "both approaches have comparable uncertainties ; the cluster abundance constraint on @xmath156 has a 20% uncertainty at the 2@xmath15 level ( ws98 ) while the cobe constraint has a 7% uncertainty at the 1@xmath15 level ( bunn & white 1997 ) . to obtain an estimate of how @xmath156 varies with @xmath1 so that we may , in turn , determine how @xmath158 varies with @xmath1 for dark and virialized lenses , we will consider three possible approaches .",
    "the first two involve fixing the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xmath2 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) and using either the cluster - abundance constrained @xmath162 or the cobe constrained @xmath162 . for the former we will use the fit given in ws98 and for the latter the fit given by ma et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; see figure 5 .",
    "the third approach is to allow the cosmological parameters to be free parameters and then jointly match the cluster - abundance constraint with the cobe constraint so that each gives the same @xmath162 . since measurements of @xmath156 are most degenerate with @xmath2 , we will let @xmath2 be the parameter that varies . in figure 6",
    "we show the region in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane where the x - ray cluster - abundance constraint , at the 95% confidence level , overlaps the cobe constraint .",
    "the solid curve shows where the central values match , with the resulting range in @xmath2 ( @xmath163 for @xmath164 ) within observational uncertainties ( wang et al .",
    "the corresponding @xmath162 curve is shown in figure 5 . as we will show , the predicted weak - lens abundances and how they vary with @xmath1 strongly depend on which @xmath162 normalization approach is chosen .",
    "we are interested in determining whether the number count and redshift distribution of both dark and virialized weak lenses have the potential to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "another possibly useful observable for this purpose is the number count of dark lenses relative to virialized lenses . since dark lenses are at an earlier stage of their dynamical evolution as compared to virialized lenses , those cosmologies that favor a faster growth of structure ( i.e. , qcdm models with larger @xmath1 ) will , for a given @xmath156 , have fewer dark lenses and more virialized lenses .",
    "the ratio of the two is therefore expected to vary with @xmath1 . a priori , this latter observable seems particularly promising . as discussed in wk02 ,",
    "the ratio of dark to virialized lenses is not very sensitive to observational noise in the weak lensing maps since observational noise equally affects the detectability of both types of lenses .",
    "contrastingly , uncertainties in observational noise will make it difficult to constrain @xmath1 by simply comparing predicted weak - lens number counts with observed weak - lens number counts .    before presenting how the above observables are modified by the dark energy",
    "we first discuss how each of the factors that determine the observed abundance are affected by changes in @xmath1 .",
    "doing so provides both physical insight into the results and illustrates the calculational procedure discussed in the previous sections .",
    "as noted above , the predicted abundance of weak lenses will vary with @xmath1 on account of three factors : the comoving volume element , the press - schechter comoving number density of virialized objects , and the value of @xmath165 [ equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) ] . the degree",
    "to which each varies depends on the chosen @xmath162 normalization .",
    "as figure 7 shows , @xmath166 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath1 for both fixed @xmath2 and @xmath167 as given by jointly normalizing @xmath156 to cobe and the cluster abundance .",
    "however , because the joint normalization yields a larger @xmath2 with @xmath1 and a less significant decline in @xmath156 for @xmath24 as compared to the cobe normalization with @xmath2 fixed , the former approach predicts a nearly constant virialized object number density with increasing @xmath1 while the latter predicts a significant decrease in the number density .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the functions @xmath150 and @xmath149 , as figure 8 demonstrates . here",
    "we plot the fraction of objects that have not yet reached turnaround ( @xmath168 ) and the fraction of objects that are between turnaround and virialization ( @xmath169 ) relative to those objects that are virialized ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the figure illustrates several key elements of structure formation according to the spherical - collapse model for dark - energy cosmologies .",
    "first , the fraction , @xmath171 , of objects in both of these lower - overdensity ranges increases with mass in accordance with the hierarchical growth of structure .",
    "the fraction also increases with redshift since objects are collapsing and evolving toward virialization .",
    "it is also interesting to note that objects with @xmath169 evolve more rapidly as compared to objects with @xmath168 .",
    "this is demonstrated by the fact that at @xmath172 the fraction of both types of objects is nearly the same though by @xmath173 there are more objects that have not reached turnaround .",
    "furthermore , the larger @xmath1 is , the greater the difference between the rates of evolution .",
    "these effects are a consequence of the suppression of structure growth in cosmologies with dark energy ; namely , growth slows down earlier for larger @xmath1 and those objects that are less overdense at a given redshift have greater difficulty overcoming the repulsive effects of the dark energy and collapsing .",
    "finally , the plots show how strongly the fraction depends on the chosen @xmath156 normalization , with a significant variation with @xmath1 for the cobe normalization and a fairly small variation for the cluster - abundance normalization .",
    "this , in turn , means that the degree to which the functions @xmath150 and @xmath149 vary with @xmath1 is highly dependent on the assumed normalization approach .      in figure 9",
    "we show the predicted redshift distribution of virialized lenses and dark lenses for three constant @xmath1 models . for the cobe normalized @xmath156 with fixed @xmath2",
    "the distributions show a fairly strong sensitivity to @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases from @xmath22 to @xmath114 the peak of the distributions shift toward lower redshifts . although one might expect the trend to be in the opposite direction given that structures form faster for larger @xmath1 models , the effect is counteracted by the decrease in @xmath156 with increasing @xmath1 . that the decrease in @xmath156 so overwhelms any tendency for structure to form faster for @xmath174",
    "is not surprising given the weak @xmath1 dependence in the @xmath79 ",
    "@xmath115 map ( figure 1 ) and in the function @xmath127 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "note , however , that the shift in the distributions with @xmath1 becomes much less significant if a joint cobe ",
    "cluster abundance normalization is assumed .",
    "finally , given that dark lenses are likely progenitors of virialized clusters , it is not surprising that both normalization approaches predict that the dark lenses have a larger mean redshift than the virialized lenses .    to determine",
    "how well the weak lens redshift distributions can constrain @xmath1 we generated mock redshift data and determined ( using the kolmogorov - smirnov test ) the probability of differentiating two different constant-@xmath1 models as a function of the number of lenses detected .",
    "we found that to differentiate a @xmath5cdm model from both a @xmath17 model and a @xmath14 model at the 3@xmath15 level required , on average , approximately 200 weak lenses and 2000 weak lenses , respectively .",
    "as we show below , this corresponds to a survey coverage of @xmath9 and @xmath175 square degrees .",
    "note , however , that for sufficiently wide surveys systematic uncertainties such as mass - redshift selection effects and lens density profiles might dominate the errors .    by integrating over the redshift distribution",
    "we obtain the total number of virialized and dark lenses expected per square degree on the sky . as figure 10 shows ,",
    "the cobe normalization with @xmath176 shows a significant decline in the number count as @xmath1 increases . by @xmath177 the number count of both virialized and dark lenses",
    "has dropped by a factor of two from the @xmath5cdm value .",
    "the joint normalization , in which we allow @xmath2 to vary with @xmath1 , predicts a much more mild dependence on @xmath1 with the number count dropping by only @xmath10% from @xmath11 to @xmath177 for both lens types .",
    "therefore , while the cobe - only normalization approach predicts that the sky coverage needed to distinguish the @xmath5cdm model from a @xmath17 model to 3@xmath15 is only @xmath4 degree@xmath178 , the joint approach requires @xmath179 15 degree@xmath178 .",
    "similarly , to distinguish the @xmath5cdm model from @xmath14 requires @xmath13 degree@xmath178 and @xmath155 degree@xmath178 , respectively .",
    "the systematic uncertainties affecting absolute sky density measurements , such as noise in the lensing maps and uncertainties in the lens density profiles , are expected to add further complications .",
    "this suggests that it will be very difficult to constrain @xmath1 using just the number count of either virialized or dark lenses without , at the very least , a tighter constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "we also note that our results do not agree with the results found by bartelmann , perrotta & baccigalupi ( 2002 ; hereafter bpb ) .",
    "they found that from @xmath11 to @xmath180 , the number of virialized weak lenses per square degree _",
    "increases _ by nearly a factor of two .",
    "the increase is roughly linear up to the maximum after which the number count declines steeply .",
    "in obtaining these results , however , they use the formulas for @xmath122 and @xmath86 given in okas & hoffman ( 2001 ) who assume that the space curvature within a collapsing overdensity patch is time - independent . as we showed in section 3.1",
    ", this assumption is invalid for @xmath100 and leads to incorrect values for @xmath122 and @xmath86 . to confirm that this is the source of our differences , we recomputed the number count of weak lenses as a function of @xmath1 using the algorithm described in bpb ( which differs somewhat from ours because we are interested in separating lenses into virialized and non - virialized types ) .",
    "when we assume the incorrect okas & hoffman ( 2001 ) values for @xmath122 and @xmath86 we recover the results found by bpb ; however , when we assume the values for @xmath122 and @xmath86 predicted by solving the spherical - collapse equations of section 3.1 , we obtain results very similar to those described in the preceding paragraphs .",
    "as mentioned above , the number - count ratio of dark to virialized lenses is an observable that is much less sensitive to observational noise than is the redshift distribution and number count of weak lenses .",
    "unfortunately , for aperture sizes @xmath37 ( defined in section 2 ) less than 10@xmath181 in radius the ratio is fairly constant over a broad range in @xmath1 , as we show in figure 11 .",
    "the ratio varies more strongly if the aperture size is increased to 15@xmath181 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath182 there is a @xmath10% difference between the @xmath5cdm model and @xmath17 , so that differentiating the two models to a 3@xmath15 significance requires the detection of @xmath183 virialized lenses or equivalently a sky coverage of @xmath16 degree@xmath178 .",
    "although using the non - virialized lens fraction requires large survey coverage for modest constraints on @xmath1 , its principal advantage ( in addition to being relatively insensitive to observational noise ) is that it is not very sensitive to the chosen method of normalization ; for any aperture size both the joint normalization and the cobe normalization with fixed @xmath2 yield similar dependences on @xmath1 . therefore ,",
    "unlike the case for weak - lens sky - density or redshift distribution predictions , uncertainties in @xmath156 and @xmath2 do not strongly affect the predicted ratio of dark to virialized lenses .",
    "incidentally , although aperture sizes greater than @xmath184 yield ratios with even stronger @xmath1 dependences , noise contributions from large - scale structure become significant at such large angular distances from the lens center ( hoesktra 2002 ) .",
    "it is therefore not practical to make measurements at radii well beyond 15@xmath181 .    as an aside , while the ratio of dark to virialized lenses does not have a particularly strong @xmath1 dependence , it does have a strong @xmath37 dependence ; only @xmath185% of lenses are dark when @xmath186 but @xmath16% when @xmath187 . in figure 12",
    "we plot the number of virialized and dark lenses as a function of @xmath37 for the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "as @xmath37 increases from 3@xmath181 to 15@xmath181 the sky density of dark lenses increases from zero to 5 per square degree while the sky density of virialized lenses peaks at @xmath78 and gradually declines for larger aperture sizes .",
    "figure 13 explains this trend . for an overdensity of mass @xmath188 we plot , as a function of redshift , @xmath189 , the projected angular size of the virialization radius , and @xmath190 , the projected angular size of the maximum radius that produces a detectable lens ( i.e. , @xmath191 where @xmath192 ) . for @xmath193",
    "an overdensity can be non - virialized and still produce a detectable lensing signal ( i.e. , a dark lens ) .",
    "however , since @xmath37 defines the maximum observable angular scale , for sufficiently small @xmath37 there is no range in redshift such that @xmath194 , in which case non - virialized overdensities can not produce a detectable lens . in general",
    "we find that the minimum aperture size needed to detect dark lenses is @xmath195 . for larger @xmath37",
    ", the area below @xmath190 and above @xmath189 has a substantial relative increase while the area below @xmath189 has just a mild relative increase . after taking into account the fact that the aperture mass @xmath196 decreases with increased @xmath37",
    ", this translates to an increase in the sky density of dark lenses and a decrease in the sky density of virialized lenses for @xmath197 .",
    "the fraction of lenses that are dark therefore increases with aperture size .",
    "we have examined the possibility of using the measured abundance of weak gravitational lenses to constrain a principal property of the dark energy , its equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 . since dark energy modifies both the background cosmology of the universe and the growth of structure it will necessarily have an effect on the efficiency of weak lensing .",
    "the goal of this paper was to determine the nature and strength of the effect .",
    "the change in the background cosmology with @xmath1 influences the predicted weak lens abundance in essentially three ways .",
    "first , the size of comoving volume elements shrink with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "second , the distance - redshift relation is modified , thereby shifting the location of the lensing - kernel maximum ( i.e. , where the combination of angular diameter distances @xmath198 peaks ) .",
    "third , since the evolution of the background matter density is modified by the dark energy , the density of a given halo relative to the background density changes with @xmath1 .",
    "this , in turn , affects the strength of a halo s lensing signal ; the larger the overdensity the stronger the signal .",
    "while the volume term is explicitly factored into the expression for the weak - lens sky density [ equation ( 22 ) ] , the latter two effects are incorporated into the signal - to - noise estimator for which we use the aperture - mass technique introduced by schneider ( 1996 ) .",
    "the change in the growth of structure with @xmath1 is somewhat more subtle .",
    "the dark energy modifies both the rate of structure growth and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum . to determine the former we solved the spherical - collapse model with dark energy included .",
    "though growth occurs more rapidly as @xmath1 increases , the overall effect on the @xmath79 ",
    "@xmath115 map , needed to relate the minimum overdensity required to produce a detectable lens , @xmath75 , to a corresponding linear - theory overdensity @xmath80 , is fairly small .",
    "similarly , the linear - theory overdensity at collapse @xmath86 does not vary much with @xmath1 . the effect on @xmath122",
    "is more significant , however . as @xmath1 increases ,",
    "structures require substantially greater overdensities in order to reach virial equilibrium because they collapse sooner , when the universe was younger and hotter .    to determine how the power - spectrum amplitude , @xmath156 , varies with @xmath1 we considered three possible approaches .",
    "one was to normalize to the x - ray cluster abundance as was done in ws98 .",
    "another was to normalize to the cobe measurements of cmb anisotropies on large angular scales .",
    "these two approaches predict similar values of @xmath156 for the @xmath5cdm model",
    ". however , if all cosmological parameters are held fixed as @xmath1 varies , the values of @xmath156 are no longer in accordance .",
    "this is because the cluster abundance approach is accounting for the earlier forming , and hence hotter , galaxy clusters in models with @xmath24 .",
    "the cobe normalization , on the other hand , is accounting for the increase in the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect as @xmath1 increases ( cf . , bpb ) . given these differing influences ,",
    "the two approaches are not expected to yield the same @xmath156 when all the cosmological parameters are held fixed to those of the @xmath5cdm model while @xmath1 is varied .",
    "this suggests a third approach to normalizing the power spectrum ; namely , let the parameters vary with @xmath1 such that the cluster abundance normalization matches the cobe normalization .",
    "in practice we accomplished this by letting just @xmath2 vary with @xmath1 , as it is the parameter most degenerate with @xmath156 . the resulting range in @xmath2 for @xmath199",
    "was found to be @xmath200 and hence within observational uncertainties .",
    "though all three normalization approaches predict that @xmath156 decreases with @xmath1 , the difference in the magnitude of the decrease between the approaches is significant . as a result , each predicts substantially different variations in the weak - lens abundance with @xmath1 .    having determined all the dark energy effects , we computed the redshift distribution and sky density of weak lenses as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "as in wk02 , we distinguished between two classes of lenses , those that have collapsed and virialized and those that have not .",
    "this distinction is based on the expectation that the virialized lenses , being in a relaxed state , are x - ray and/or optically luminous .",
    "the non - virialized lenses , being as at earlier stage in the overdensity evolutionary cycle , are expected to be x - ray underluminous because the observed x - ray luminosity function has a steep dependence on the total virialized mass within a halo . furthermore , though the typical mass of both lens types is @xmath201 , the sky density of galaxies within the non - virialized lenses is expected to be smaller than in the virialized lenses because they have not yet collapsed and hence have larger radii ( see wk02 for more details ) .",
    "we found that the variation in the redshift distribution and the sky density of both lens types with @xmath1 depends strongly on the power - spectrum - normalization approach .",
    "if @xmath2 is fixed and @xmath156 is normalized to the cobe measurements , there is a significant variation in the abundances with @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", the sky density of both virialized lenses and non - virialized lenses drops by a factor of two from @xmath6 to @xmath3 .",
    "this decline , a result of the significant decrease in @xmath156 with @xmath1 , occurs despite the faster formation of structure for @xmath24 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath2 is allowed to vary with @xmath1 such that the cobe normalization matches the cluster - abundance normalization , the redshift distributions and sky density change very little with @xmath1 ; between @xmath202 and @xmath3 the sky density of both lens types varies by just @xmath10% .",
    "this insubstantial variation is the result of an increase in @xmath2 with @xmath1 and a less significant drop in @xmath156 with @xmath1 as compared to the cobe normalization with @xmath2 fixed .",
    "obtaining a strong constraint on @xmath1 from the sky density or redshift distribution of weak lenses therefore appears to be contingent on improved measurements of @xmath2 from independent observations .",
    "perhaps more promising is the possibility of utilizing the observed ratio of dark lenses to virialized lenses . unlike measurements of the absolute sky density of weak lenses ,",
    "the ratio is not very sensitive to the amount of observational noise in the weak - lensing maps since the abundance of both dark lenses and virialized lenses are equally affected by noise .",
    "similarly , the ratio does not vary significantly over a wide range in cosmological parameters so that uncertainties due to the @xmath203 degeneracy are minimized .",
    "we found that for aperture sizes of @xmath184 the ratio varies by about 20% , dropping from @xmath204 to @xmath205 , between the @xmath5cdm model and @xmath12 .",
    "we also showed that the ratio of dark to virialized lenses increases with aperture size , in effect because larger apertures enable the detection of the more extended radii of the non - virialized lenses .",
    "weak lensing has already been shown to be a powerful probe of the matter distribution in the universe ( see e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "it also has the potential to help constrain the amount and nature of the dark energy .",
    "huterer ( 2002 ) showed that given reasonable prior information on other cosmological parameters , the weak - lensing convergence power spectrum can impose constraints on the dark energy comparable to those of upcoming type ia supernova and number - count surveys of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "constraining the dark energy from absolute measurements of weak - lens abundances will likely prove difficult , however .",
    "the variation in the weak lens sky density with @xmath1 is sufficiently small that modest uncertainties in @xmath2 ( and observational noise ) can mask the effect of the dark energy .",
    "more auspicious is the possibility of utilizing the relative abundance of dark lenses to virialized lenses to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "future weak - lensing projects such as the the vista survey , the snap mission , and lsst ( see tyson et al .",
    "2002 for a discussion of its great promise as a probe of dark energy ) are expected to provide the wide - field surveys needed for this technique to be viable .",
