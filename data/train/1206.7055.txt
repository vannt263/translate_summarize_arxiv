    "models of new physics occasionally allow for the existence of approximately degenerate states which under reasonable assumptions are likely to share common decay modes leading to unanticipated effects .",
    "some potential examples of such possibilities include , , @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks in fourth generation models@xcite , the heavy higgs fields , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the cp - violating mssm@xcite@xcite , cp - violating effects in neutrino mixing between nearly degenerate states@xcite , the lightest @xmath4 and @xmath5 kaluza - klein ( kk ) fields in higgsless models@xcite as well as the level-2 kk neutral gauge bosons , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , present in split - universal extra dimensions ( , split - ued ) . frequently , as in the later two examples , these are states that can be searched for as resonances in a particular channel , such as in the drell - yan process , , @xmath8 , at the lhc .",
    "in such searches the mutual effects of these dual resonances upon each other can play an important role .    in pioneering work",
    ", the authors of refs.@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that the necessary conditions for a breakdown in the usual double breit - wigner ( bw ) description of such nearly degenerate resonance pairs to occur are : ( @xmath9 ) the mass splitting between the resonances should be comparable to their widths , , on the order of a few per cent , ( @xmath10 ) they share common decay modes _ and _ , more importantly , ( @xmath11 ) the various imaginary entries in their self - energy ` matrices ' have somewhat comparable values .",
    "when such a breakdown of the b - w description occurs , the resonances become ` coupled ' in such a way as to lead to a distortion in their expected combined lineshapes .",
    "this is caused by the additional interference induced by these off - diagonal terms in the self - energy matrix , which is not captured by the usual b - w prescription .",
    "such an interference can be either constructive or destructive in nature depending upon the specifics of the new physics model .",
    "these authors showed that , if destructive , it might be possible that the resonance signature can be sufficiently suppressed so as to be entirely missed in first - round collider searches .",
    "as a specific case in point , in this paper we consider the production at the lhc of the nearly degenerate level-2 kk neutral gauge bosons , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , present in the split - ued@xcite scenario . as we will see , such states , though at least superficially seeming to satisfy all of the three conditions above , do not show any significant , non - bw interference effects and certainly none which are sufficient to mask their existence . before a discussion of the specifics of this split - ued model",
    ", we briefly review the essentials of this mixing formalism in the case of two nearby neutral spin-1 resonances .",
    "to be explicit , in the discussion presented below we follow the analysis and notations as given in ref.@xcite for the case of two nearby resonances that share common ( production and ) decay modes . in this @xmath14 case , the generalized propagator matrix for these two gauge fields can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is itself the @xmath14 propagator matrix for scalars whose elements are given by @xmath17 and where @xmath18 the calculation of the quantities @xmath19 is straightforward from the usual 1-loop vacuum polarization diagrams ; in the cases of interest to us , since all the couplings of the two neutral gauge fields are real , @xmath20 . these off - diagonal elements will , of course , be zero when the two vectors do not share common decay modes .",
    "when that happens the matrix is already diagonal and the standard b - w description of the two resonances then goes through as usual .",
    "further , we note that these off - diagonal entries need not be positive , , they can quite generally be of either sign .",
    "note that in the limit where the masses of all the final state objects in the decays of these resonances can be neglected ( which will be at least approximately true at lhc energies for the cases of interest ) we obtain the momentum scaling @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the conventionally calculated on - shell widths of these two resonances .",
    "note that in this same limit , @xmath23 will also similarly scale as @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath19 can thus be thought of as generalized running - widths . in the case of split - ued",
    ", the final states common to both @xmath25 and @xmath26 will consist of the usual zero - mode ( , sm ) fermions .",
    "thus we find that @xmath23 can be simply expressed in terms of ( weighted ) sums , over the sm fermions , of the set of products of the vector and axial - vector couplings of the two gauge fields : @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to remember that the individual contributions to @xmath23 from any given fermion can have either sign so that the _ overall _ sign of @xmath23 is a indeterminate ; however , we would a priori expect that the size of this element would be comparable in magnitude to those appearing on the diagonal . in the specific numerical analysis",
    "below , the @xmath19 will be calculated including all finite mass effects along with the relevant approximate qcd and qed corrections .    in order to see how this more complicated propagator structure affects resonance cross sections it is instructive to consider the @xmath28-channel exchange of ( in general , @xmath29 ) neutral gauge bosons with real couplings between an initial state ( @xmath30 ) and a final state ( @xmath31 ) consisting of sm fermions .",
    "in such a case , in the amplitude in ` gauge boson space ' can be symbolically written as @xmath32 which leads to @xmath33 or , by simple rearrangement @xmath34 where @xmath35 and , in the limit of massless fermions , @xmath36 and @xmath37 by taking traces over the gamma matrices and fermion spinors as usual .",
    "the denominator of the matrix @xmath38 is simply @xmath39 which in this @xmath14 case is explicitly given by @xmath40 ^ 2+\\big[\\sigma_{11}(s - m_2 ^ 2)+\\sigma_{22}(s - m_1 ^ 2)\\big]^2 \\,,\\ ] ] while the numerator of @xmath38 in the @xmath14 case effectively contains only 6 independent terms ; this follows from hermiticity , the initial symmetries of the propagator matrix itself , as well as the reality of the fermion gauge couplings which also simultaneously enforces the cancellation of the ( potential ) imaginary terms in the sums above .",
    "the essential details of the properties of split - ued can be found in ref.@xcite which we summarize here . in minimal ued@xcite@xcite@xcite ,",
    "sm gauge and matter fields are allowed to propagate freely in a flat , @xmath41 orbifolded , 5-d space ( of internal radius @xmath42 ) .",
    "these states have the usual sine and cosine type wavefunctions , for their various kk - modes , depending upon whether they are even or odd under the @xmath43 symmetry .",
    "one of the effects of orbifolding ( which is introduced to obtain chiral zero - mode fermions ) is to break kk number conservation down to only kk - parity .",
    "thus while even mode @xmath44 gauge fields do not couple at tree - level to the zero - mode sm fermions , one - loop radiative corrections can and do induce such small , loop - suppressed couplings .",
    "however , unlike in minimal ued , in split - ued the sm fermions are allowed to have bulk mass terms , @xmath45 which lead to a distortions in both the fermion kk spectrum and the associated wavefunctions",
    ". in particular , zero - mode fermions now have wavefunctions which either peak at the center ( @xmath46 ) or at the boundaries ( @xmath47 ) of the orbifold depending upon the the sign of @xmath48 .",
    "one effect of this , particularly relevant for our discussion here , is to allow for a direct tree - level coupling of the even @xmath49 kk gauge fields to the sm zero - mode fermions .    for a fermion with a bulk mass @xmath50 the coupling to the @xmath51-mode gauge field for @xmath52 in units of the corresponding sm gauge coupling",
    "is given by the function@xcite @xmath53~[1-\\coth ( x)]}\\over { \\sqrt 2 ~[x^2+(m\\pi/2)^2]}}\\,,\\ ] ] which vanishes as @xmath54 ( corresponding to the usual tree - level minimal ued limit ) and goes to @xmath55 as @xmath56 as the fermion becomes highly localized at the origin . for simplicity and purposes of demonstration in the discussion below",
    "we will taken a common value for @xmath57 for all of the sm fermions .",
    "precision electroweak ( ewk ) constraints indicate that the region of low @xmath58 is now somewhat preferred@xcite@xcite . for such typical parameter values ,",
    "the width to mass ratios of both the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are of order a few percent while their loop - induced mass splitting@xcite is found to be comparable , on the order of @xmath59 .",
    "as they certainly share the various sm fermions as common decay modes these two gauge kk fields apparently seem to meet all of the criteria @xmath60 above for states which may have important non - bw interference .",
    "we now turn to a numerical study of these effects at the lhc .",
    "searches for new neutral gauge bosons at the 7 tev lhc in the drell - yan channel have been performed by both the atlas and cms collaborations@xcite but with only null results so far .",
    "preliminary cms results at 8 tev also show no hint or a signal@xcite with @xmath61 fb@xmath62 of luminosity .",
    "these searches have become fairly powerful , already excluding a @xmath4 with sm - like couplings below a mass of @xmath63 tev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath64 fb@xmath62 . of course these limits",
    "would degrade for somewhat weaker couplings and/or smaller branching fractions into the dilepton final state .",
    "thus the first question we should address is whether or not width mixing effects could be hiding split - ued in current data and then to address the issue of whether or not future data at higher energies and luminosities could also hide such a signal .    in our case of interest , once the values of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the cutoff scale , are chosen all of couplings and other properties of the new gauge bosons are completely specified",
    ". recall that due to ewk breaking and radiative corrections the weak eigenstates @xmath67 and @xmath68 are only _ approxomate _ mass eigenstates@xcite and experience a relatively small amount of mass mixing via a calculable angle , @xmath69 which approximately scales as @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being the usual higgs vev , in both the neutral and charged gauge boson sectors .",
    "this result follows immediately from the calculations of the various kk gauge boson masses ( including the contributions of important loop corrections ) which are clearly left unaltered in the current split - ued scenario@xcite .",
    "we make use of the exact expressions for all of the various masses and mixing angles in the analysis that follows .",
    "since we must fully account for these small but important mixing effects in our analysis we we will instead refer to the physical eigenstates as @xmath72 and @xmath73 to avoid any potential confusion . in this basis ,",
    "the @xmath4 couples to the sm fermions as @xmath74\\,,\\ ] ] while @xmath5 couples to these same fermions instead as @xmath75\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the usual isospin generator , @xmath78 is the electric charge , @xmath79 in terms of the usual weak mixing angle and @xmath80 .",
    "complete expressions for the relevant mass matrices from ref.@xcite are used in our numerical analysis below . note that when @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as will occur for zero - mode gauge fields , we recover the usual sm gauge couplings for the @xmath83 and @xmath3 .",
    "however here we find that @xmath84 for the @xmath85 modes . in order to perform our numerical calculations for",
    "the lhc we will employ cteq6.6 parton densities@xcite and approximate nnlo k - factors@xcite . as we noted above , the various sm fermion partial width calculations will include finite mass effects as well as approximate nlo qcd and lo qed radiative corrections .    to be specific for purposes of demonstration , let us focus on the important process @xmath86 assuming @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 at the @xmath89 tev lhc with an integrated luminosity of 20 fb@xmath62 .",
    "under such conditions we would anticipate that the double resonance signal structure would be quite obvious and this is indeed the case as is shown in fig .",
    "the result shown here reflects our current ( @xmath89 tev with a luminosity of 5 fb@xmath62 ) knowledge for @xmath4-like searches .",
    "furthermore , at the level of the statistical fluctuations we see here the rather _ unanticipated _ result that there is very little if any observable difference between the conventional split - ued signal and the one in which the width mixing effects are included .",
    "we thus conclude that such width mixing effects would not be able to hide split - ued signatures in the current lhc data sample .    to see whether or not this is just an effect of limited statistics and to see what the lhc may be able to do in the future in this regard , we increase @xmath90 to 1 tev , @xmath91 to 13 tev and the luminosity to 100 fb@xmath62 keeping @xmath88 and show the corresponding result in fig .",
    "again we see that the double resonance structure is clearly visible with or without the inclusion of width mixing effects ( as is the usual strong destructive interference below the peaks signaling kk gauge boson production ) .",
    "clearly this is no longer an issue of statistics but the actual absence of any visible width mixing effects contrary to our expectations .",
    "how can such an outcome be realized if we seemingly satisfied all of the necessary conditions above ?",
    "is it a numerical accident or something deeper ?",
    "tev and an integrated luminosity of 20 fb@xmath62 assuming @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 .",
    "the yellow histogram is the sm background from conventional drell - yan production while the blue ( red ) histogram shows the expectations for split - ued without ( with ) the effects of width mixing included .",

    "the yellow histogram is the sm background from conventional drell - yan production while the blue ( red ) histogram shows the expectations for split - ued without ( with ) the effects of width mixing included .",

    "numerically is the result of the fact that the contributions from the various sm fermions to this off - diagonal width can appear with either sign .",
    "when these various contributions are then summed in the present case , however , the total is found to be quite small , in fact , near zero .",
    "why is this ?    to understand what is happening",
    "consider for simplicity of discussion the value of @xmath23 in the limit where all the sm fermion masses can be neglected relative to those of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( this is an excellent approximation ) and where the leading qcd and qed corrections to the various partial widths can also be neglected .",
    "( of course these approximations are introduced only for the ease of this discussion and are not used in obtaining any of the numerical results that are shown here . ) in such a limit , we can express the value of @xmath23 in terms of a trace over products of the sm generators @xmath77 and @xmath94 using the coupling expressions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 above and by remembering that in the sm @xmath95 .",
    "explicitly , one finds that @xmath96\\,,\\ ] ] where the trace is taken over the various sm fermions . although @xmath97 and @xmath98 for each generation and are thus of order unity , the first term in the square bracket is highly suppressed due to the very small value of the angle @xmath69 , which here is of order @xmath99 .",
    "the second term has no such suppression factor , however , since here the coefficient @xmath100 appears .",
    "but in this case we remember that @xmath101 since all members of any weak isospin multiplet will necessarily have the same value of the weak hypercharge so that this term must automatically vanish ( as for any isomultiplet @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus as long as @xmath69 is very small we can never generate a sufficiently large off - diagonal element in the width matrix to produce a statistically significant non - b - w effect .",
    "this remains true even if new fields are added to those already occuring in the sm or if one modifies our specific choices of the basic split - ued input parameters .",
    "there are no significant width mixing effects in the case of gauge boson kk production in split - ued as long as the fermionic couplings are given as above and this result is not significantly modified by the small modifications due to finite fermion masses or qed / qcd corrections .",
    "the reason for this is that the leading order qcd corrections are flavor - independent and that the largest fermion mass effect is @xmath103 , , the same size as the small mixing terms discussed above .",
    "further , note that since the width mixing takes place solely within the gauge boson propagators and the masses of the incoming quarks are effectively zero ( so that the longitudinal part of the gauge propagators can be dropped ) we will observe the same ( lack of ) width mixing effect for all other possible final states such as @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "in this paper we have examined the possible influence of non - b - w width mixing effects on the production of a nearly degenerate pair of level-2 kk gauge bosons , @xmath106 , at the lhc within the framework of split - ued .",
    "although this model apparently seems to satisfy all of the criterion necessary for such effects to be numerically significant , surprisingly , on closer inspection it does not .",
    "one finds that the total contribution to the width mixing parameter is very highly suppressed and even vanishes in the limit when small mass mixing between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states goes to zero .",
    "the main suppression of this width mixing effect is due to the orthogonal nature of the @xmath77 and @xmath94 generators in the sm , , the fact that @xmath107 identically for any weak isospin representation . unfortunately",
    ", although the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are nearly degenerate and share common decay modes , when summed over the off - diagonal partial widths essentially add up to ( almost ) zero , thus producing an insignificant width mixing effect .",
    "hopefully the lhc will provide us some other laboratory to study effects of this kind .",
