    ", it can always be partitioned into balls and @xmath19-handles in this fashion .",
    "we simply partition the disk so that a collar of each @xmath17 in the definition of the ribbon intersection is a @xmath19-handle , while the remainder will then be a collection of embedded balls .",
    "we will call such a presentation of a ribbon disk a _ handle presentation _ for the disk .",
    "every higher - dimensional ribbon knot @xmath3 has a ribbon disk whose handle presentation has two embedded balls with exactly one @xmath19-handle attached to them , with all other embedded balls having exactly two @xmath19-handles attached to them .",

    "an arc - like handle presentation induces a partition of the knot into disks at the ends and cylinders corresponding to the boundaries of each ball and handle .",

    "it is straightforward to see that every band presentation defines a ribbon knot , and every ribbon knot has a band presentation .",

    "hence the disks may be isotoped to one another , and by the previous lemma , the framing on their interiors may be modified to agree .",
    "note that the disks may have to move through one another during this procedure.@xmath20    [ bandstable]given two band presentations @xmath21 , these represent the same properly ribbon link @xmath3 iff they are stably equivalent .",

    "we may use trivial addition to stably modify them to have the same number of bands . using handle slides",

    "the bands also have a natural linear ordering .",
    "we will show that the bands from one disk can be moved to agree with the bands of the other using only stable equivalences .",

    "now a band , being an embedded @xmath49 , is therefore a thickened disk , and hence a framed disk .",
    "so we need to show that the corresponding thickened disks are isotopic relative to their meet with the collar of @xmath3 .",

    "the motion generically meets @xmath23 in ( thickened ) @xmath52 manifolds , which may generically meet if the motion does not trace out an embedded submanifold .",
    "if the motion cuts across another band of @xmath23 in a sphere , this can be accommodated by a handle slide .",
    "if the motion meets the other band in an aspherical or immersed manifold , we may shrink the other band until the manifold is a sphere .",
    "if the motion meets one of the balls , we may slide the motion off while at most adding additional meetings with other bands , since @xmath28 is an unlink .",
    "once we have performed this for each band , the result follows.@xmath20 + note that in the above theorem , we had to begin with the fact that both band presentations presented the same knot , as this allowed us to ensure that @xmath53 for all bands . if we could not guarantee this to start , in addition to the fact that the unlinks @xmath54 agreed ( at least where they do not meet the bands ) then there would be no way to guarantee the existence of an isotopy between them ( for otherwise it would follow that any two presentations with the same number of bands were isotopic , and since band number is variable , this would imply that all higher - dimensional ribbon knots are isotopic ) .",
    "+ there is an immediate scholium to the above proof . for in our modifications , if two band presentations were already arc - like , our only modifications were reparametrizations , addition / deletion , and handle slides .",
    "so we have really shown the following theorem .",
    "any two band presentations for the same higher - dimensional properly ribbon link are stably equivalent .",
    "furthermore two arc - like band presentations are stably equivalent without handle slides.[stab ]    consider now the case where @xmath8 and @xmath23 are handle presentations instead of band presentations .",
    "suppose @xmath21 are properly ribbon surfaces with arc - like presentations and with common boundary the higher - dimensional link @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath23 can be changed into @xmath8 by a finite sequence of ambient isotopies and ri moves.[suf ]    * proof : * we begin by reparametrizing the ribbon surfaces so that the decomposition given by both partitions @xmath3 in the same way , and to agree on a collar of @xmath3 as in lemma [ com ] .",

    "we may perturb them to meet in general position . by jordan",
    "s theorem , @xmath58 divides the ambient space into a number of regions . we may change @xmath59 to agree with @xmath60 by eliminating their intersections from innermost out ( note that they already agree near @xmath3 by our original perturbation ) .",
    "now if another segment of @xmath3 ( including both handles and balls ) enters a given region , it must do so in one of three ways by general position arguments .",
    "first , it may enter and exit through the same ribbon disk .",
    "second it may enter through one and leave through the other . finally it may enter and terminate . in all cases , as @xmath23 is moved , it changes only by ri moves . not that it may change by an ri3 move if there is another ball which is inside the region .",
    "if another ball spans multiple regions , we may fix this by shrinking it along @xmath23 .",
    "repeating for all balls completes the theorem.@xmath20 + although we have been focused upon arc - like handle presentations , we can extend this result to the general case .",
    "let @xmath61 be ribbon surfaces for properly ribbon higher - dimensional links with handle decompositions which are not necessarily arc - like . then @xmath61 present equivalent knots iff they are related by a sequence of isotopies , handle slides , and ri moves .",
    "* proof : * suppose the two surfaces present the same link . as shown previously we can , by handle slides , adjust the ribbon surfaces to be arc - like . our previous theorem now implies the resulting arc - like ribbon surfaces are related by ri moves and isotopies .",
    "conversely , if two handle presentations are related by handle slides , ri moves , and isotopics , it is immediate that they present isotopic knots.@xmath20 + a band presentation , like a handle presentation , may be interpreted in any dimension ( of at least @xmath62 ) .",
    "if we take the band presentation for a ribbon @xmath0-knot @xmath3 and interpret it as a @xmath18-knot @xmath63 , this knot will have @xmath3 has a cross - section , and @xmath3 is said to _ induce _",
    "it has been shown@xcite that classical ribbon knots induce inequivalent @xmath43-knots .",
    "nakanishi asked whether this phenomenon held in higher dimensions or not .",
    "he showed that stably equivalent band presentations induce the same isotopy class when the dimension is raised by @xmath19@xcite .",
    "using this fact , together with the above result , gives an immediate answer to the question .",
    "if @xmath3 induces @xmath63 and @xmath64 as above , then @xmath63 and @xmath64 are isotopic .",
    "we may specify an arc - like ribbon surface in dimension four by specifying the preimage and the direction of each crossing .",
    "we may also assume that each ball in the presentation has exactly one intersection , except the ends which we may assume have none .",
    "such a ribbon disk can be presented as a graph in @xmath5 which is @xmath62-valent except for two vertices for the ends of each component , with labels at each vertex to represent the direction of that intersection . in particular , the immersed disk will deformation retract onto such a graph , as shown in fig .",

    "-valent vertices at each ribbon intersection .",
    "if these vertices are labelled then this process can be reversed up to ambient isotopy.[retract ] ]    in such a graph , each vertex represents a ball , while the arcs represent parts of the handles .",
    "the ri moves naturally induce corresponding moves on such graphs , and hence such graphs form a method for faithfully presenting isotopy classes of properly ribbon @xmath0-links , @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , by the following lemma we may either consider representations using such graphs embedded in @xmath5 or simply using abstract graphs , since the ri moves are local in nature and since edges of graphs may be slid past one another provided @xmath1 .",
    "[ graph ] if the cores of two ribbon disks are isotopic as graphs , or equivalently if the abstract labelled graphs are equivalent with labels , then the two knots presented are isotopic",

    ", we may shrink all balls in the handle presentation to neighborhoods of the vertices where they agree , and now the handles are essentially @xmath19-dimensional objects , so we may do the same for them.@xmath20 + however , it is convenient for some purposes to consider presentations via planar graphs .",
    "to do so , we use additional vertices called _ welded crossings_. welded crossings were first defined in the context of braid groups in @xcite , and later their relationship with ribbon knots was studied in @xcite .    ]",
    "let us refer to the graph representations as _",
    "l diagrams_. in order for this representation to be useful , we must find a collection of complete moves for it .",
    "it suffices therefore to introduce a method whereby any two graphs which represent the same arc - like disk presentation are related , and also whereby any ri move can be performed . + a complete set of moves is shown in fig .",
    "[ comp ] .     is only permitted if @xmath65.[comp ] ]    the moves in fig .",
    "[ comp ] are complete .",
    "* proof : * clearly any ri move can be performed using the moves on l diagrams .",
    "now consider an arc - like ribbon disk .",
    "there is a tubular neighborhood of it which has the homotopy type of a graph in @xmath5 .",
    "a generic projection of such a graph to the plane consists of an immersion with a finite number of separated double points .",
    "consider the space @xmath66 of all possible projections .",
    "any two generic projections can be connected by a path that goes through only those which are analogous to those encountered for knots , as well as the one which corresponds to the s move . resolving those singularities",
    "yields the remainder of the moves .",
    "+ alternately : nelson has shown that the information given by the preimage of a ribbon disk is sufficient to specify a welded arc equivalence class up to switching each crossing by the analogue of an s - move and reversing orientations.@xcite .",
    "since we can perform the s - move and do not have orientations , such information specifies an l diagram up to equivalence.@xmath20    let @xmath67 denote the category of ribbon @xmath0-knots as a subcategory of @xmath0-tangles .",
    "let @xmath68 be the map defined by reinterpreting l diagrams .",
    "then for @xmath69 , @xmath70 .    * proof : * by the previous corollary it is straightforward to check that the moves on the diagrams are the same for all @xmath1.@xmath20 + this map @xmath71 is in fact related to yanegawa s cross - sections . in particular",
    ", @xmath72 is a cross - section of @xmath3 . since @xmath73 are bijections , it follows that cross - sections for higher - dimensional knots are unique .",
    "this stands in contrast to the result for classical knots ; a given classical knot is the cross - section of multiple @xmath43-knots , and a given @xmath43-knots in general has many cross - sections .",
    "+ an alternate way of proving the above is to use the following lemma .",
    "once the lemma is established , one may note that a ball - handle decomposition of a higher - dimensional knot uniquely determines an @xmath0-knot , @xmath1 , for any @xmath0 .",
    "the specification of information on the preimage for a ribbon disk consisting of containing hypersurfaces , through - crossings , and which side of the through - crossing is above ( in the sense of the normal ) at the through - crossing suffices to specify an isotopy class of ribbon @xmath0-knot for @xmath1    * proof : * choose two ways of embedding the balls and handles .",
    "then we can first isotope one family of balls to agree with the other .",
    "now the handles can be made to agree since they pass through one another.@xmath20 + there is thus a surjection @xmath74 defined by taking the preimage information mentioned from the classical knot and reinterpreting it as preimage information for a @xmath43-knot .",
    "the lemma implies that such a map is well - defined .",
    "it is a surjection by the fact that any preimage information can be realized ( non - uniquely ) for a classical knot.@xmath20 + we will now examine the relationship between l diagrams and the diagrams of satoh@xcite .",
    "satoh works with oriented welded arcs to represent ribbon knots . rather than labelling the crossings",
    ", he uses the orientation to determine the type of crossing .",
    "it immediately follows that a welded arc can be reinterpreted as an l diagram .",
    "following satoh we will designate the l diagram resulting from a welded diagram @xmath75 as @xmath76 .    ]",
    "we can now precisely determine the preimage of a @xmath0-knot under @xmath77 .",
    "define the _ total reverse virtualization _ of a welded arc @xmath75 to be the welded arc which results from performing the analogue of the s - move to each crossing and reversing the orientation of the arc .",
    "suppose @xmath78 are equivalent l diagrams .",
    "then either @xmath79 are welded equivalent , or else @xmath75 is equivalent to the total reverse virtualization of @xmath80 , or equivalently @xmath81 , with the mirror here being taken to be the mirror image of the diagram , not the crossing - switched version .",
    "* proof : * we may use a theorem of nelson on reconstructing welded knots@xcite . in its original form",
    "the result is phrased in terms of decorated quandle presentations , but for our purposes , we may simplify the statement of the result and say that specifying a collection of arcs , a collection of crossings with signs , and a longitude is sufficient to reconstruct a welded knot up to welded isotopy .",
    "now only two longitudes are possible .",
    "hence if one is not given , the ambiguity is of order @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "one way to construct a welded knot with identical crossings but opposite longitude is to take the mirror reversed welded knot , and another way is to reverse the orientation and perform s - moves at each crossing . now",
    "the information in a l diagram can be used to obtain a list of arcs and crossings with signs , but not a longitude .",
    "hence two possible welded diagrams correspond to a given l diagram .",
    "s - moves on the l diagram do not change the arc / crossing information , so they do not change which two welded diagrams correspond to the l diagram , and l diagram moves can be mimicked on the welded diagrams , so it follows that any other welded knot diagrams which give rise to an equivalent l diagram are welded equivalent to one of our original two.@xmath20 +",
    "in terms of band presentations , it is shown in @xcite that there are band presentations for the same classical knot which are not stably equivalent .",
    "our proof fails here because generically the isotopy surface meets the unlink of the presentation in @xmath82-dimensional submanifolds , which need not be @xmath82-spheres .",
    "the initial impetus for this work was to consider aspherical knots of the form @xmath83 , which are in many ways like labelled immersions of @xmath40 in the plane . indeed satoh@xcite originally focused on the possibility of representing ribbon embeddings of tori in @xmath84 , and his work generalizes to @xmath83 immediately .",
    "however , because the torus has multiple generators for its first homology we can not guarantee that two ribbon surfaces for it will have compatible handle decompositions .",
    "we may define two ribbon surfaces to be _ @xmath85-equivalent _ if they have identical representations as graphs .",
    "the completeness theorem would therefore follow if we could show that every ribbon surface for a torus has a @xmath85-equivalent representative in every class of surfaces with compatible handle decompositions .",
    "+ on the other hand , there is a class of tori for which this obstruction can not occur .",
    "the peripheral structure of a knotted surface may be defined by analogy with that of a classical knot . for ribbon knotted tori ,",
    "the only difference is that the longitude no longer has a preferred generator , but it is still a cyclic subgroup of the fundamental group@xcite .",
    "if this cyclic subgroup has infinite order , then any two ribbon disks must have ribbon singularities whose boundaries are isotopic on the torus . for",
    "if this were not true , then one of these disks will appear having as boundary a @xmath86 curve on the torus with nontrivial longitudinal component .",
    "this would allow us to homotope ( in fact isotope ) some multiple of the generator to the identity .",
    "+ the natural analogue of a ribbon torus in dimensions @xmath87 and above is @xmath88 , for @xmath89 . because this has @xmath52 homology isomorphic to @xmath90 , it can be seen that all embedded representatives of a generator of the @xmath52 homology are isotopic , and hence that all ribbon singularities will have parallel boundaries .",
    "we may therefore generalize our results to this case .",
    "in fact we can also generalize to connected sums of such knots .    for @xmath89 and properly ribbon links containing only components of type @xmath4 and connected sums of @xmath88 ,",
    "two band presentations present the same link iff they are stably equivalent , and two ribbon surfaces present the same link iff they are related by ri moves .",
