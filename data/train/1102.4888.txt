    "correlation is the relationship between different things , and is a pervasive phenomena in nature .",
    "it is the way by which we learn the external world , and is the bridge on which we communicate each other and transmit information from this end to the other .    in the classical world , correlations have been well studied from the viewpoint of information theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however `` quantizing '' classical information or correlation is definitely not an effortless work .",
    "the difficulties crop up in that quantum information , unlike the classical counterpart , is encoded in quantum states which may not be orthogonal and thus may not be distinguished unambiguously , and moreover , quantum systems can be correlated in ways inaccessible to classical objects .",
    "one of the prominent features of quantum correlation is entanglement .",
    "entangled states can not be prepared with the help of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) and thus they are nonclassical .",
    "entanglement is indeed an important aspect of quantum correlation and is a prerequisite for many tasks of quantum information processing @xcite . nevertheless , entanglement is not the only aspect of quantum correlation , and the notion of quantum correlation is more general than entanglement .",
    "for example , there exists quantum nonlocality without entanglement @xcite .",
    "various approaches , other than through entanglement , have been proposed to study the correlations in composite quantum system .",
    "the first attempt at quantifying quantum contents of correlations is due to zurek .",
    "the concept of quantum discord is proposed and develops to a measure of how non - classical the underlying correlation of two quantum systems is @xcite .",
    "the important issue is the existence of quantum correlations beyond entanglement in separable states .",
    "quantifying classical correlations in a bipartite quantum state and splitting the total correlation into a classical and a quantum part was presented by henderson and vedral @xcite . later the henderson - vedral ( h - v ) classical correlation was shown to have an operational meaning : the regularization of h - v classical correlation is just the maximal amount of common random bits obtained by one - way locc operations in excess of communication invested @xcite . in @xcite oppenheim _ et al _ presented an operational proposal , which comes from thermodynamical consideration , to quantify quantum correlations ( see also @xcite ) . by considering the amount of noise required to erase the correlation , groisman _",
    "et al _ gave an operational definition of the quantum , classical , and total amounts of correlations in a bipartite quantum state @xcite .",
    "recently modi _ et al _ proposed a unified view of quantum and classical correlations @xcite .",
    "the above considerations shed new light on the properties of the correlation incorporated in composite quantum system . following the division of total correlation into classical and quantum part ,",
    "many works have been devoted to study the roles played by different types of correlation in quantum processes , and reveal the relationship between them .",
    "these studies involve fuzzy measurement @xcite , mixed - state quantum computation speedups @xcite , broadcasting of quantum state @xcite , complete positivity of dynamics @xcite , complementarity and monogamy relationship between classical and quantum correlations @xcite and dynamics of discord @xcite .    however , there is no effective method to calculate the exact results of quantum discord and other measures of quantumness analytically . unlike the measure of entanglement , the new paradigms of quantumness of correlations",
    "are measurement oriented .",
    "what should be done in these paradigms is to extract information about system a by measuring another system b. given a bipartite quantum system in the state @xmath0 , when measuring system b gives the outcome @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 , system a would be in some postmeasurement state @xmath3 . for a complete measurement on system b ,",
    "the @xmath4 and the @xmath2 are the members and probabilities of an ensemble of the local state of system a , that is , @xmath5 .",
    "the accessible information about system a with respect to the particular measurement is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the von neumann entropy of a state @xmath8 .",
    "the major obstacle is to maximize the accessible information , or equivalently , to minimize the average entropy @xmath9 , over all possible complete measurements performed on system b. the explicit analytical results of quantum discord are known only for very special cases : bell - diagonal states @xcite , x - shaped states @xcite of two - qubit system , and gaussian states of continuous variable systems @xcite .    considering this problem , we propose in this paper a geometric method to describe the quantum discord of two - qubit quantum states .",
    "the geometric method is based on the idea of quantum steering ellipsoid which is defined in @xcite .",
    "quantum steering ellipsoid is such an ellipsoid in three - dimensional real space @xmath10 that each point in the interior or on the surface represents a postmeasurement state of one qubit when particular measurement has been performed on the other qubit .",
    "we denote the quantum steering ellipsoid by @xmath11 .",
    "the available postmeasurement states are constrained by the @xmath11 .",
    "or in other words , the decomposition of one local state , say @xmath12 , can only be performed in the @xmath11 ( including the surface ) , namely , @xmath5 for each @xmath13 .",
    "we call a postmeasurement ensemble optimal if this ensemble can minimizes the average entropy",
    ". we also call the optimal ensemble as the optimal decomposition of the local state .",
    "it can be shown that the optimal ensemble can only be found on the surface of @xmath11 .",
    "this situation can be compared with the optimal signal ensembles studied in @xcite , where the output states of a noisy quantum channel are restricted in a convex set @xmath14 , and the optimal signal ensemble @xmath15 is such that the holevo quality , @xmath16 with each @xmath17 and @xmath18 , reaches the maximum on @xmath15 .    for two - qubit x states , there are only two candidates for the optimal ensemble .",
    "we call them equi - entropy decomposition and quasi - eigendecomposition respectively",
    ". the geometric picture of these two forms of decomposition is clear : equi - entropy decomposition corresponds to a horizontal line segment , while quasi - eigendecomposition to a vertical one .",
    "then the known results for bell - diagonal states and x states can be `` seen '' in this picture .",
    "subsequently , we study the dynamics of classical correlations and quantum discord in the presence decoherence . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that there is a sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime for some bell - diagonal states undergoing non - dissipative decoherence .",
    "we generalize this result to the case of general x states .",
    "the sudden transition can even be `` seen '' in the geometric picture .    not only can the geometric method be used to recover the known results , but also it should help us seek the possible analytical expressions of quantum discord for more general states . following this line of thought , we consider a class of two - qubit states that have more complicated forms than x states . for these states , we can not give a thoroughly analytical procedure to derive the classical correlations or quantum discord .",
    "however , numerical computations give us the interesting results .",
    "we find that , just like the case of x states , there are only two possibilities as to the optimal postmeasurement ensemble .",
    "one is equi - entropy decomposition , and the other , although not the quasi - eigendecomposition , has intimate relation with the quasi - eigendecomposition . in the former case",
    ", we can write out analytical expressions for classical correlations and quantum discord , while for the latter further research is needed to characterize its property .",
    "we think that these phenomena revealed by numerical work should not be accidental coincidences .",
    "if these phenomena can be verified analytically , they will give us a geometric insight into the quantum discord .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief overview of the concepts of classical correlations and quantum discord . in section 3",
    "we introduce a very useful tool , quantum steering ellipsoid , for evaluating quantum discord of two - qubit states .",
    "we present in section 4 the geometric picture to evaluate and describe the quantum discord of x states . for x states undergoing decoherence ,",
    "the dynamics of classical correlations and quantum discord is studied and depicted geometrically in section 5 .",
    "more general states are considered in section 6 and 7 .",
    "several conjectures and numerical tests are presented therein .",
    "section 8 concludes .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the logarithm has base @xmath19 .",
    "numerical computations are performed by using mathematica @xmath20 .",
    "consider a bipartite quantum system composed of particle a and particle b , which are possessed by alice and bob respectively .",
    "the state of the whole system is described by a density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "total correlation between particle a and particle b is usually measured by the mutual information , that is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are local states of a and b respectively , @xmath24 .",
    "mutual information quantifies the strength of the correlation . for product state @xmath25 , the entropy @xmath26 is additive , namely , @xmath27 , and it follows that the mutual information for any product state is zero . for maximally",
    "entangled state , such as @xmath28 with @xmath29 the dimension of the hilbert space of subsystem a or b , the mutual information reaches its maximal value , @xmath30 .",
    "it is shown that quantum mutual information is just the minimal rate of randomness that is required to completely erase all the correlations in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the total correlation @xmath31 can be split into quantum part @xmath32 and classical part @xmath33 , namely , @xmath34 .",

    "the left - arrow over @xmath33 indicates the situation that bob performs measurement to acquire the information about alice s system .",
    "similarly , if alice performs povm , @xmath46 , we can define the information gained about particle b by measuring particle a as @xmath47      = s(\\rho^b)-\\min_{\\mathcal{n}}\\sum_{j}p_j s(\\rho_j^b).\\ ] ] generally , @xmath48 , meaning that the classical information is asymmetric .",
    "it is natural to define quantum correlation as the difference between total correlation and classical correlation , namely , @xmath49 similarly for @xmath50 .",
    "quantum correlation @xmath32 is also called quantum discord .",
    "quantum discord , which is originally defined as the the difference between two classically identical ( but quantumly distinct ) formulas that measure the amount of mutual information of a pair of quantum systems @xcite , aims to capture all the quantum correlations , not limited to entanglement .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between entanglement and discord for mixed states , although they are equivalent for pure states .",
    "a typical example of this is the separable states with nonvanishing discord @xcite",
    ". other forms of definition of quantum discord can be found in @xcite .    to obtain quantum discord or classical correlation , one has to make considerable effort to minimize the average entropy @xmath9 over all possible measurements on particle b. in the next section",
    ", we introduce a useful tools , quantum steering ellipsoid , which will help us to establish a geometric picture about these concepts .",
    "first we express the states and povm elements in hilbert - schmidt space .",
    "let @xmath0 be a two - qubit state shared by alice and bob .",

    "let s define two four - components vectors in the row form , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "we will treat @xmath73 as a full rank matrix .",
    "some states with singular @xmath73 will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "also note that ( [ relation between y and x ] ) imposes constraint on the vector @xmath76 : although @xmath77 can represent any projective measurement , the vector @xmath76 can not be arbitrary .",
