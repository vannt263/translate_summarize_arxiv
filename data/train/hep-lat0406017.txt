    "in the theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it has so far been impossible to derive hadron masses directly using analytical methods .",
    "lattice qcd is an approach whereby the functional integral is evaluated numerically to obtain various physical quantities .",
    "one difficulty in this has been the inclusion of dynamical quark effects , but this is an area where much recent progress has been made .",
    "however , for computational reasons , the masses of the valence quarks can be much more easily varied than those of the sea quarks .",
    "this situation is referred to as partially quenched lattice qcd .",
    "the quark masses which can be accessed by present simulations are , especially for the sea quarks , significantly larger than the physical up and down quark masses . in order to obtain the masses of the lightest hadrons ,",
    "one thus needs to extrapolate from the quark masses used in the lattice calculations to the physical ones .    in this domain",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) , which is an effective low - energy field theory approximation to qcd , should be valid .",
    "it provides the correct quark mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson masses , including the nonanalytic dependences often referred to as chiral logarithms .",
    "the three flavour @xmath0pt , as formulated by gasser and leutwyler  @xcite , is valid in the qcd case with equal valence and sea quark masses , and can not be used to extrapolate from partially quenched lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the extension of @xmath0pt to the quenched  @xcite and partially quenched  @xcite cases has been carried out by bernard and golterman .",
    "the most general expression at one loop for the pseudoscalar meson masses was worked out by sharpe and shoresh  @xcite . in this work we present the result for the meson masses at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in pq@xmath0pt .",
    "it should be pointed out that the case of full qcd corresponds to the special case of partially quenched qcd where the sea and valence quark masses are put equal .",
    "the free parameters or low energy constants ( lecs ) of @xmath0pt , i.e. the qcd case , may thus be unambiguously determined from those of pq@xmath0pt .",
    "these points are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we work here in the version of pq@xmath0pt without the supersinglet @xmath2 , discussed in detail at one loop in  @xcite . here",
    "we present the expression for the charged , or off - diagonal , meson mass for the case of equal valence and equal sea quark masses , but these different from each other .",
    "the charged meson masses for the more general quark mass cases , as well as more details of the present calculation will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . planned",
    "work includes the decay constants and the neutral , or diagonal , meson masses .",
    "note that the presence of nnlo terms is already seen in the works of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next sections we present the technical background , the full expression for the pseudoscalar meson mass , and finally a short discussion and numerical results as a function of the input quark masses .",
    "most of the technical aspects required for calculations at the two - loop level in pq@xmath0pt without @xmath2 already exist , but they have not been mentioned as such .",
    "the full divergence structure at one loop was worked out in  @xcite .",
    "there , it was noted that the divergence structure is really identical to that of normal @xmath0pt with the number of flavours equal to the number of sea quark flavors , provided that the traces and matrices are replaced by the supertraces and matrices appropriate for quenched @xmath0pt .",
    "this is justified by the replica method . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the quenched approximation , i.e. no sea quarks , can also be obtained using the replica method .",
    "this entails a calculation with @xmath3 flavors , setting @xmath4 in the final answer . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was proven explicitly at one - loop order .",
    "these arguments can be generalized to higher orders and to pq@xmath0pt .",
    "this allows the use of the known results for @xmath3 flavours in normal @xmath0pt ( valence and sea quark masses equal ) , in order to obtain the needed lagrangians at @xmath5 and @xmath1 from ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the full divergence structure from ref .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3 flavor lagrangian at @xmath5 contains the term with @xmath6  @xcite , see also  @xcite . in the context of pq@xmath0pt , this extra term was pointed out in ref .",
    "we will use the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite for the lagrangian at @xmath5 and @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the renormalized @xmath5 lecs , and @xmath9 for the renormalized lecs at @xmath1 .",
    "the reason why these lagrangians can be obtained by simply replacing the trace by the relevant supertrace  @xcite is that the structure of the equations of motion and all other identities used are the same as for the @xmath3 flavor case of refs .",
    "however , the cayley - hamilton identity used there to reduce the lagrangians for the two and three flavour case is not valid in pq@xmath0pt .    the last technical difficulty in pq@xmath0pt as compared to the mass calculations at two loops in @xmath0pt  @xcite are the extra two - loop integrals needed since the propagators in pq@xmath0pt can have a double pole structure .",
    "these extra integrals can be evaluated using the same methods as was used for the integrals in ref .",
    "@xcite , provided that derivatives of those expressions w.r.t .",
    "the relevant masses in the propagators are taken .",
    "the mass of the pseudoscalar meson is obtained by means of dimensional regularization from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ feynfig ] and those at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the result is expressed in terms of the valence quark mass , @xmath12 , and the sea quark mass , @xmath13 , via @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these correspond to the lowest order charged meson masses .",
    "other parameters include the decay constant in the chiral limit ( @xmath17 ) , the quark condensate in the chiral limit , via @xmath18 , and the lecs of @xmath5 and @xmath1 , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the finite parts of the loop integrals in the expressions below are @xmath21 where the subtraction scale dependence has been moved into the loop integrals .",

    "the notation used for the integrals is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite except that an extra integer argument now indicates the needed propagator structure .",
    "index ( 1 ) corresponds to the case of single propagators only , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas index ( 2 ) indicates that the first propagator appears squared , index ( 3 ) that the second propagator appears squared , and finally index ( 5 ) that the first and second propagators appear squared .",
