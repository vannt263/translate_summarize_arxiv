    "@xcite obtains more stringent constraint @xmath8 . on the other hand , @xcite recently reported a detection of primordial non - gaussianity at greater than 99.5% significance .",
    "further detailed analyses of non - gaussianity is clearly necessary in order to reconcile and understand the various constraints and claimed detections .",
    "different approaches to the study of non - gaussianity exploit different statistical properties and will be sensitive to different aspects of the behaviour of the pattern being tested . in general , there is no unique statistic to describe the non - gaussian nature of a sample in a complete manner .",
    "a given method may have strong discriminatory power for one particular form of non - gaussianity , but this is not necessarily the case for all possible alternative distributions .",
    "testing non - gaussianity therefore requires a battery of complementary techniques rather than a single approach .",
    "it is particularly important to use different statistical approaches in the context of primordial non - gaussianity , because the physical mechanism responsible remains unknown .",
    "furthermore , in the real world , issues including survey masks and inhomogeneous noise have to be taken into consideration .",
    "different statistics may be sensitive to different systematics and foreground artefacts , so that complementary analysis using different statistics are essential for a robust detection .",
    "analyses using different statistical methods are useful to validate or refute basic theoretical models and constrain model parameters more accurately .",
    "the most commonly used statistic for non - gaussian analysis is the bispectrum ( or even trispectrum ) which focuses on information contained within three - point ( or four - point ) correlations .",
    "other approaches represented by minkowski functionals ( mfs ) and genus statistics ( one of mfs ) utilize information concerning the integrated morphology and topology of the density structure , and are dependent on all order of correlation functions .",
    "their robustness and generality therefore makes them ideal complements to standard correlation analyses .    in this analysis ,",
    "we focus on the _ local _ model of primordial non - gaussianity characterized by @xmath0 in equation ( [ eq : ngpotential2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite show that the bispectrum is the optimal statistics in the estimation of @xmath5 and then other statistics ( e.g. , trispectrum ) are useless even if there are different foreground contaminations .",
    "this is , however , only the case when the local model exactly describes the real universe .",
    "other forms of non - gaussianity , different from the one purely characterized by @xmath0 , which may exist in a real observation , could make the fit of the theoretical estimation as a function of @xmath0 to the observation worse and also influence the estimation of @xmath0 among different statistics .",
    "different statistical approaches are , therefore , still useful to test the assumed model of primordial non - gaussianity and also possible observational systematics by checking if they have a reasonable goodness of the fit to observations and thus give a consistent limit on @xmath0 compared to that that from the bispectrum .    in this paper , we present a measurement of primordial non - gaussianity from the mfs of the wmap three - year temperature maps .",
    "we apply perturbative formulae recently derived by @xcite to do the comparison with observations ; previous analyses rely on non - gaussian simulations @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the theoretical predictions with non - gaussian simulations has already been established in sachs - wolfe limit @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply non - gaussian simulations based on full radiative transfer computations and then demonstrate that the analytical predictions accurately reproduce the simulation results .",
    "@xcite already derived an analytical formula for the genus statistic in the sachs - wolfe approximation to compare with wmap data .",
    "our analysis takes more detailed physics into account and is consequently more accurately applicable to a wider range of scales .",
    "observational effects ( including antenna beam pattern , inhomogeneous noise and the survey mask ) could be other sources of confusion . from a comparison with simulations including these observational issues , we find that the observational systematics are negligible to estimate the primordial non - gaussianity from wmap data directly using our method .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : data ] the wmap three - year data studied here are briefly introduced . in  [ sec : comp_sim ] we test whether the perturbative formulae well describe the mfs for the non - gaussian simulation maps even including the various observational effects mentioned above . in ",
