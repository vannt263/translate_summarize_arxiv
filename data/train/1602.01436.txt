    "road networks are expanding rapidly around the world , connecting people and resources , increasingly in remote regions @xcite .",
    "this provides a huge challenge for species conservation as roads can act as a physical barrier to migration and therefore potentially limit gene flow , reducing effective population sizes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , roads can be corridors for species invasions into remote landscapes , with people and their vehicles acting as dispersal vectors @xcite .",
    "consequently , roadlessness increases overall landscape connectivity for most forest species @xcite and has been successfully used as a measure , e.g. , to predict species richness and composition of amazonian bird communities @xcite .",

    "have been associated with roads built for selective logging @xcite .",
    "therefore , forest areas that are not accessible by roads are considered of highest conservation value because they provide habitats that are not immediately impacted by major human activities .",
    "the protection of such `` intact forest landscapes '' ( ifl ) that are not penetrated by roads is high on the biodiversity conservation agenda .",
    "they have been defined for the year 2000 as those areas @xmath0  500  km^2^ and @xmath0  10  km wide that are outside a buffer of one  km around any road or settlement @xcite .",
    "while ecologically the intactness of a forest depends on many factors , in remote tropical regions the operational use of the term `` intact '' corresponds to the concept of roadlessness .",
    "the underlying assumption is that important impact of roads inside intact forest landscapes are not only the dissection of formerly connected habitats but also the process of incision @xcite that opens the forest for anthropogenic disturbances @xcite . due to the easy detectability of newly constructed roads in",
    "otherwise closed canopy forests , the current identification of intact forests excludes any forest that has recently been penetrated by roads built for selective logging , independent of harvest intensity .",
    "however , e.g. in central africa , only 20% of roads built for logging are permanently accessible , with the remaining 80% becoming rapidly vegetated @xcite .",
    "forest certification , such as that of the forest stewardship council ( fsc ) , provides market - based incentives for logging operators who are audited for their sustainable forest management implying reduced impact logging standards , traceability of timber and social welfare for workers @xcite .",
    "adherence to these standards should require the prevention of long - term negative impacts on forest ecosystems , e.g. through poorly designed roading systems @xcite .",
    "under increasing pressure from the international environmental ngo greenpeace , fsc has recently passed a motion to better protect ifl as part of their `` high conservation value forest '' policy and implement this as a new standard by the end of 2016 @xcite .",
    "central africa , with some of the world s least exploited tropical forests , is at the center of attention for this policy change .",
    "to quantify roadlessness in forest landscapes , new methods are required .",
    "this is essential to determine if logging operations certified for their good management did limit road network expansion . in the sangha river catchment , a prime target area for selective logging activities in the congo basin , we assessed the change in logging road networks between 1999 and 2015 in order to determine how this differed between forest areas varying in certification status and location inside or outside ifl . in order to quantify and test the spatial distribution of road networks",
    ", we developed a novel use of the empty space function ( _ f _ ) , an established mathematical tool that allows quantification and testing of the spatial distribution of roadless areas .",
    "we hypothesized that roadless space would have increased less rapidly in fsc - certified than in non - certified concessions , and even less inside intact forest landscapes , assuming a positive interaction between certification and ifl . based on our findings",
    "we discuss the implications for forest conservation and management .",
    "the study area is 107  000  km^2^ in extent , covering parts of republic of congo , cameroon and central african republic .",
    "most of the area is characterized by guineo - congolian semi - deciduous forest @xcite .",
    "this region has only recently been subject to a rapid expansion of logging road networks into previously intact forests @xcite .",
    "these logging operations mostly take place in concessions , large state - owned forest areas that are allocated to companies for timber harvesting according to a forest management plan @xcite .",
    "we analysed a total of 67 concessions of varying sizes ( range 217 - 10  270 , median 660  km^2^ ) .",
    "these are operated by 17 different companies , mostly in groups of several bordering concessions ( range 365 - 15  560 , median 1970  km^2^ ) to reduce infrastructure costs . between 2006 and 2009",
    "14 concessions have been awarded fsc certification @xcite , covering 40% of the total area of concessions .",

    "we vectorised forest roads during nine two - year time intervals based on a time series of 222 landsat  7 and 8 images captured between 1999 and 2015 .",
    "based on the contrasting spectral properties of bare soil and recovering vegetation we were able to differentiate open ( actively used ) and abandoned ( in process of revegetation ) roads @xcite . in the present study we included only those roads that were open on any image during the 16-year time interval",

    "these were derived from a digital elevation model @xcite and thus directly reflect the topography . despite the fundamental difference in ecological characteristics between rivers and roads ,",
    "both are general random sets and can be analysed with the same tool .",
    "a priori the distribution of the rivers in the region should be independent of the management and intactness of forests . therefore _",
    "f _ is expected to show no difference for rivers between zones of different forest management type ( because rivers are not managed in that region ) but to vary for roads due to the effects of management .",
    "we duly found that empty space curves for river networks were very similar throughout all forest management categories ( fig .",
    "[ fig : riv ] ) .",
    "tests showed no significant differences : _ p _ values were @xmath0  0.9 for all combinations .",
    "this does not mean that the river networks were identical but it is consistent with the assumption that the distribution of rivers is independent of forest management across the study area .",
    "this indicates that the methodology is accurate in that it does not show variation between equally distributed patterns such as the existing river network .",
    "the method most commonly used to evaluate intactness of forests is based on one pre - defined buffer distance around any road or settlement @xcite .",
    "this approach is quick and easy but lacks accuracy in that it does not take into account the highly dynamic nature of forest degradation @xcite .",
    "different species have different radii of movement just as different human land uses affect forest functions over varying distances @xcite .",
    "the binary classification of an area based on a buffer ( intact vs. degraded ) is closely linked to road length density and does not take road location in the overall landscape into account .",
    "an alternative way to characterize landscapes is to quantify , for a certain area , the distance from each point to the nearest road @xcite .",
    "this idea is implemented in the metric of roadless volume @xcite where a pixel of an area is assumed to have a higher value the further away it is from a road , which then allows calculation of the volume under this pseudo - topographic surface as an index of roadlessness .",
    "we follow the approach of riitters & wickham @xcite by integrating their idea in an established mathematical function .",
    "the empty - space function @xmath1 ( or spherical contact distribution function ) is based on stochastic geometry and random sets theory @xcite .",
    "the main hypothesis for our work is that that the road networks is the realization of a random set . for a stationary random set @xmath2 ,",

    ", @xmath1 can be described as @xmath6 .",
    "given the assumption of stationarity this does not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "similar to random variables , the @xmath1 function can be interpreted as a moment characterizing the considered random pattern .",
    "knowing one such moment provides a characteristic of the studied object but will not completely describe it .",
    "nevertheless , it provides an important general feature of the entire analysed pattern , and is therefore valuable for data analysis and interpretation @xcite .",
    "the observation window @xmath8 serves as a sampling frame in a larger overall study area .",
    "this includes an inherent bias for the estimation of @xmath1 due to the edge effect wherever the borders obscure the actual distance to an element that lies outside @xmath8 .",
    "based on the analogy with the estimation of a survival function , the distance of a reference point @xmath7 to @xmath2 is assumed to be right - censored by its distance to the boundary of @xmath8 .",
    "several estimators built on these ideas are available in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we have implemented the estimator of @xmath9 given by foxall & baddeley @xcite .",
    "we applied this type of analysis to our road networks data .",
    "the @xmath9 estimation requires the evaluation of the probability that circles of increasing radii centred on any point in @xmath10 intersect the line pattern .",

    "the @xmath9 function was evaluated for each model simulation on a finite set of values of @xmath12 .",
    "this allowed a statistical analysis as in illian et al .",
    "@xcite , enabling the construction of range envelopes for @xmath9 , hence characterizing the linear pattern corresponding to each model .",
    "in order to synthesise all the information gathered using this statistical approach , we consider the median curve obtained from these envelopes .",
    "the results obtained from 100 simulations are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] .",
    "clearly , the length of the line patterns is not the only element characterizing such an object .",
    "the @xmath9 function appears to successfully integrate more information related to the entire line network topology .",
    "roadless space in the study area was calculated inside randomly placed , square observation windows .",
    "the size of each window was 30@xmath1130 km , this length being set as twice the maximum distance to a road of any point in the study area . for each year we ran 10  000 replications and kept only those windows that had at least 80% of their area in the same management / protection status category .",
    "this gives for each year and category a number of samples @xmath13 between 500 and 1000 . for each replicated window",
    "we derived @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath12 domain for the application of the empty space function is the interval given by @xmath14 $ ] km which we divided into discrete steps of 0.2 km .",
    "now , for year and category , for the fixed values of @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 corresponding values for @xmath9 .",
    "empirical quantiles were computed for each @xmath12 value and , finally , the median was considered .",

    "in 2015 roadless space was very similar inside and outside ifl as well as in certified and non - certified areas outside national parks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : es ]  a ) .",
    "however , the median curve of the _ f_-function for fsc concessions outside ifl was slightly higher than the others , indicating that this category had less roadless space .",
    "for all of the study area outside the protection of national parks we found a maximum distance of 9.8  km from any point to a road .",
    "this means that the maximum possible distance between two roads is 19.6  km .",

    "no overlap of the confidence intervals with zero indicate significant changes between the two years.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "areas that were classified as intact forest landscapes ( ifl ) in 2000 are likely to be those which had been subject to least recent logging activity . with the ongoing process of governments leasing concessions for areas of unlogged forest , our result that roadless space greatly decreased inside these ifl during 1999 - 2007 was expected . however , that this process continued during 2007 - 2015 in concessions certified by fsc since 2006 , whereas it stopped in non - fsc concessions , is surprising .",
    "selective logging in the region focuses on only a few commercial timber species of high market value and expanding logging into previously unlogged areas is more lucrative than repeating logging in the same area @xcite . however , road construction is expensive and the length of roads built is limited by the capital resources of operating companies .",
    "fsc guidelines restrict logging intensity and impose strict requirements to reduce road - related impacts such as poaching , erosion and disturbance of watercourses @xcite , while recommendations about road networks only suggest avoiding `` poorly designed patterns of roading '' @xcite .",
    "this commonly means reducing road lengths to a minimum while still allowing sufficient access to the timber resource @xcite .",
    "however , recent discussions about certified logging in ifl highlight the importance of maximising conserved roadless space as a new component in sustainable forest management .",
    "the key consideration in choosing between different road layouts should be to retain undissected blocks of forest and this requires control of the position of permanent roads in the overall forest landscape .",
    "the only net losses of roadless space that we recoded since 2007 took place in fsc - certified concessions .",
    "this means that in all other areas , roads that disappeared outweighed those that were newly built .",
    "this is linked with the relatively short time that logging roads remain open after abandonment @xcite .",
    "we assume that road building in each concession is related to the capital resources of the operating companies .",
    "the intensity of forest exploitation in the region is fluctuating and was strongly affected by the global economic crisis in 2009 @xcite when a reduction in the volume of timber exports resulted in temporary shutdowns of logging activities .",
    "however , official wood production volume data ( available at http://www.observatoire-comifac.net ) shows that in subsequent years exploitation increased progressively .",
    "this was especially true for the two companies ifo and cib , which operate four of the largest concessions in the study area , all of which obtained fsc certification between 2006 and 2009 .",
    "the annual wood production volume increased by 45% from 2009 to 2013 in the ifo concession and by 24% in the cib concessions @xcite .",
    "there are several potentially confounding factors that may have influenced this .",
    "well - capitalized companies may have adopted both fsc certification and efficient means of exploitation , leading to a higher density of roads , whereas less capitalized companies did not .",
    "logging history also differs between concession areas . in concessions that have previously been logged , there is less likelihood of yielding high timber volumes in the present cycle and therefore companies may be less likely ( a ) to accept the costs of fsc certification or ( b ) to build many new roads .",
    "the protection of ifl has to be approached at a larger scale than individual logging concessions .",
    "given that the extent of most ifl exceeds the size of individual concessions by far , there is still the potential to retain much greater roadless areas than can be achieved by a single operating company within one concession . the most important factor driving the reduction of roadless space is the position of roads in the overall forest landscape within which this space is located .",
    "roads built closer to the edge have a less fragmenting effect than those in the center .",
    "bigger concessions and those located in the center of the overall forest landscape therefore have a more important role in retaining a large contiguous area that is road - free .",
    "annual felling areas have to be outlined in management plans before exploitation and are the determining factor for where new roads are built ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aac])@xcite .",
    "so far , there is no limitation of the maximum size and position that these areas are allowed to have .",
    "instead , fsc and other forest management guidelines focus on the annual allowable cut , the maximum volume of wood per year and minimum size of trees that are harvested @xcite .",
    "the environmental advantage of reducing logging intensity is equivocal if instead a greater area needs to be exploited ( and made accessible by roads ) in order to produce the same volume of timber as before @xcite .",
    "outside ifl there was a low rate of change in roadless space with a small increase sustained during 1999 - 2015 in non - certified concessions .",
    "this represents the saturation of the forest area with permanent roads some time after the commencement of timber exploitation .",
    "it is expensive for companies to maintain and control roads that are permanently accessible and they have a strong interest in reducing the extent of open roads to the minimum that is necessary for their operational efficiency .",
    "overall , more than 80% of all logging roads are closed and abandoned after a short period of harvesting @xcite , a practice in accordance with recommendations for good forest management @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that , inside non - certified concessions located in areas with a longer logging history ( i.e. outside ifl ) , in recent years the ratio between abandoned and newly created roads led to a slight increase in roadless space .",
    "we suggest to extend forest road building recommendations by taking into account the spatial layout of the road network ( and thus the conserved roadless space ) on regional scale .",
    "based on our findings of limited road persistence @xcite we suggest that logging roads should be managed as transient elements in the landscape that affect only a small part of the overall area of forest at a given point in time .",
    "road networks should be planned so that the majority of the forest area remains inaccessible to damaging human activity ( i.e. as roadless space ) at all times , but the exact location of this roadless space may shift over time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy2 ] ) .",
    "other than the theoretical model of conservation concessions , where after a first cut the concession area becomes protected @xcite , logging companies should be held responsible for conserving the integrity of the forest except for the small portion where logging takes place every year .",
    "key to this integrity will be the planning and management of the road network . a particular danger",
    "is posed by permanent access roads that often transect forest areas , thus keeping the core of the forest open to permanent threats , providing pressures exist .",
    "wherever necessary , these roads should be closed effectively and replaced by less fragmenting ones in the periphery of the forest .",
    "we suggest this as a principle for all logging road management in tropical forests .      the protection of intact forest landscapes ( ifl ) is currently being incorporated into fsc certification policy .",
    "given that the extent of most ifl exceeds the size of individual concessions and frequently crosses country borders , this process affects multiple stakeholders .",
    "based on our findings we suggest that control of the spatial arrangement of permanent roads is an essential requirement to protect ifl .",
    "we recommend that measures to reduce the impacts of selective logging should not only be based on amounts of timber extracted per time and area but also include the size of forest areas that remain undissected by roads .",
    "the preservation of large connected areas of roadless space needs to become a top priority in forest management and this can only be achieved by effectively monitoring the spatial arrangement of roads that are permanently accessible for which we advocate the use of the empty space function developed in this paper .",

    "<S> forest degradation in the tropics is often associated with roads built for selective logging . </S>",
    "<S> the protection of intact forest landscapes ( ifl ) that are not accessible by roads is high on the biodiversity conservation agenda , a challenge for logging concessions certified by the forest stewardship council ( fsc ) . </S>",
    "<S> a frequently advocated conservation objective is to maximise the retention of `` roadless space '' , a concept that is based on distance to the nearest road from any point . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a novel use of the empty space function  a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random sets theory  to calculate roadless space in a part of the congo basin where there has recently been rapid expansion of road networks . </S>",
    "<S> we compared the temporal development of roadless space in certified and non - certified logging concessions inside and outside areas declared as ifl in the year 2000 . between 1999 and 2007 , rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless space in ifl . </S>",
    "<S> after 2007 , this trajectory levelled out in most areas , due to an equilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became revegetated . </S>",
    "<S> however , concessions within ifl that have been certified by fsc since around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space , thus reaching a level comparable to all other concessions . </S>",
    "<S> only national parks remained road - free . </S>",
    "<S> we recommend that forest management policies make the preservation of large connected forest areas a top priority by effectively monitoring  and limiting  the occupation of space by roads that are permanently accessible . </S>"
