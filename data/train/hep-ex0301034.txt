    "heavy flavour production in two - photon events at lep 2 centre - of - mass energies is dominated by charm production processes in which both of the photons couple directly ( _ direct processes _ ) or in which one photon couples directly and the other appears resolved ( _ single - resolved processes _ ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main_proc ] ) @xcite .",
    "these two contributions are of the same order of magnitude within the experimental acceptance . because the single - resolved process is dominated by @xmath13 fusion , the measurement of the cross section can give access to the gluon content of the photon .",
    "moreover , the large masses of the c and b quarks provide a cutoff for perturbative qcd calculations , allowing a good test of qcd predictions for the corresponding reactions .",
    "contributions from processes in which both photons appear resolved ( _ double - resolved processes _ ) are suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the total cross section @xcite .",
    "the production of b quark is expected to be suppressed by a large factor compared to charm quark because of the heavier mass and smaller absolute charge .    in the present analysis charm production",
    "is measured in two steps .",
    "a high - purity @xmath11 sample is first selected , then examined for its charm content via reconstruction of d@xmath14 mesons in their decay to @xmath15 .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "a short description of the aleph detector is given in section  [ sec : aleph ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations for signal and background processes are described in section  [ sec : mc ] . in section  [ sec : select ] , event selection and reconstruction of d@xmath14 mesons are discussed .",
    "the results of the analysis are presented in section  [ sec : xs ] . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "a summary is given . throughout this letter charge - conjugated particles and their decays",
    "are implicitly included .",
    "the aleph detector has been described in detail in @xcite . here , only the parts essential to the present analysis are covered briefly .",
    "the central part of the aleph detector is dedicated to the reconstruction of the trajectories of charged particles .",
    "the trajectory of a charged particle emerging from the interaction point is measured by a two - layer silicon strip vertex detector ( vdet ) , a cylindrical drift chamber ( itc ) and a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the three tracking detectors are immersed in a @xmath16 axial magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoidal coil .",
    "together they measure charged particle transverse momenta with a resolution of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 in gev/@xmath19 ) .",
    "the tpc also provides a measurement of the specific ionization @xmath20 .",
    "an estimator @xmath21 is formed to test a particle hypothesis , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the expected specific ionization and the estimated uncertainty for the particle hypothesis h , respectively .",
    "a mass hypothesis may be tested by means of the @xmath24 values themselves or by calculating @xmath25 confidence levels @xmath26 .",
    "photons are identified in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , situated between the tpc and the coil .",
    "the ecal is a lead / proportional - tube sampling calorimeter segmented in @xmath27 projective towers and read out in three sections in depth .",
    "it has a total thickness of 22 radiation lengths and yields a relative energy resolution of @xmath28 , with @xmath29 in gev , for isolated photons .",
    "electrons are identified by their transverse and longitudinal shower profiles in ecal and their specific ionization in the tpc .",
    "the iron return yoke is instrumented with 23 layers of streamer tubes and forms the hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) .",
    "the latter provides a relative energy resolution of charged and neutral hadrons of @xmath30 , with @xmath29 in gev .",
    "muons are distinguished from hadrons by their characteristic pattern in hcal and by the muon chambers , composed of two double - layers of streamer tubes outside hcal .",
    "two small - angle calorimeters , the luminosity calorimeter ( lcal ) and the silicon luminosity calorimeter ( sical ) , are particularly important for this analysis to veto events with detected scattered electrons .",
    "the lcal is a lead / proportional - tube calorimeter , similar to ecal , placed around the beam pipe at each end of the detector .",
    "it monitors angles from 45 to 160 mrad with an energy resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "the sical uses 12 silicon / tungsten layers to sample showers .",
    "it is mounted around the beam pipe in front of the lcal , covering angles from 34 to 58 mrad , with an energy resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "the information from the tracking detectors and the calorimeters are combined in an energy - flow algorithm  @xcite . for each event",
    ", the algorithm provides a set of charged and neutral reconstructed particles , called _ energy - flow objects_.",
    "in order to simulate the process @xmath33 , the leading - order ( lo ) pythia 6.121 monte carlo @xcite is used .",
    "events are generated at @xmath1 centre - of - mass energies ranging from 183@xmath2 to 209@xmath2 using the corresponding integrated luminosities for weighting .",
    "two different samples , direct and single - resolved processes , were generated for each of the considered d@xmath14 decay modes using matrix elements for the massive charm quark .",

    "the event variables used for the event preselection are based on the aleph energy - flow objects .",
    "the following cuts , derived from monte carlo studies , were applied to select two - photon events .",
    "* the event must contain at least 3 charged particles .",
    "this cut reduces the background from leptonic events .",
    "* the visible invariant mass @xmath6 of the event must lie between 4@xmath45 and 55@xmath45 while the total energy of charged particles @xmath46 should not exceed 35@xmath2 in order to reject the @xmath1 annihilation background . * the visible transverse momentum @xmath47 of the event",
    "is required to be less than 8@xmath48 , as the @xmath47 distribution has a much longer tail for all considered background processes . * to reject further background processes a cut combining the number of charged tracks and the visible energy @xmath49 of the event is applied : @xmath50 . * finally ,",
    "in order to retain only events with almost on - shell photons an anti - tagging condition was applied , i.e. , tagged events were rejected .",
    "a tag in this analysis is defined as an energy - flow object in the luminosity calorimeters ( lcal and sical ) with an energy of at least 30@xmath2 .",

    "charm quarks are detected using exclusively reconstructed d@xmath14 mesons which decay via d@xmath52 , with the d@xmath53 being identified in three decay modes , ( 1 ) @xmath54 , ( 2 ) @xmath55 , and ( 3 ) @xmath56 . as a basis for possible",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , open charm production in @xmath11 collisions is dominated by contributions from direct and single - resolved processes . in the direct case",
    "the @xmath101 pair makes up the final state of the @xmath11 system ( in lo ) whereas in the single - resolved case the partons of the resolved photon ( photon residue ) in addition to the @xmath101 pair make up the final state .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath102 of the d@xmath14 is correlated with the invariant mass of the @xmath101 system and the total visible invariant mass @xmath6 is in turn correlated with the invariant mass of the total @xmath11 system .",
