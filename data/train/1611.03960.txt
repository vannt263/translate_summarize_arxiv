    "phase transitions are sudden changes of the macroscopic behavior of a physical system composed by many interacting parts occurring while an external parameter is smoothly varied , generally the temperature , but e.g. in a quantum phase transition it is the external magnetic field . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "a phase transition is a non - analytic point in the partition function emerging as the thermodynamic limit has been performed .",
    "the successful description of phase transitions starting from the properties of the microscopic interactions among the components of the system is one of the major achievements of equilibrium statistical mechanics .    from a statistical - mechanical point of view , in the canonical ensemble , a phase transition occurs at special values of the temperature @xmath2 called transition points , where thermodynamic quantities such as pressure , magnetization , or heat capacity , are non - analytic functions of @xmath2 .",
    "these points are the boundaries between different phases of the system .",
    "starting from the exact solution of the @xmath3-dimensional ising model @xcite by onsager @xcite , these singularities have been found in many other models , and later developments like the renormalization group theory @xcite have considerably deepened our knowledge of the properties of the transition points . typically , but non necessarily , these singularities are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon , giving rise to symmetry breaking phase transitions ( sbpt hereafter ) . in this paper",
    "we consider this case only .",
    "but in spite of the success of equilibrium statistical mechanics , the issue of the deep origin of sbpts remains open , and this motivates further studies of sbpts .",

    "the partition function is by definition @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( in unit @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the kinetic part of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the configurational part . in order to develop what follows we assume the potential to be lower bounded .",
    "@xmath12 can be written as follows @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the potential per degree of freedom , and the @xmath15 s are the @xmath16-level sets defined as @xmath17 the @xmath15 s are the boundaries of the @xmath18 s ( @xmath19 ) defined as @xmath20 the set of the @xmath15 s is a foliation of configuration space @xmath21 while varying @xmath16 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath15 s are very important submanifolds of @xmath21 because as @xmath24 the canonical statistic measure shrinks around @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the average potential per degree of freedom .",
    "thus , @xmath25 becomes the most probably accessible @xmath16-level set by the representative point of the system .",
    "this fact may have significant consequences on the symmetries of the system and on the analyticity of @xmath12 because of the very complex topology in general of the @xmath25 which changes while varying @xmath2 .",
    "we can make the same considerations for @xmath10 , but the related submanifolds @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the kinetic energy per degree of freedom , are all trivially homeomorphic to an @xmath4-sphere , thus they can not affect the symmetry properties of the system by topological reasons . furthermore , @xmath10 is analytic at any @xmath2 in the thermodynamic limit , so that it can not entail any loss of analyticity in @xmath11 .    in sec .",

    "[ phi4noint ] we present the same study for a case where no sbpt is present , i.e. the @xmath0 model without interaction , in order to compare the two cases and obtain hints towards a general understanding of the general relation between topology changes and sbpts . in both cases we use morse theory as a mathematical tool that allows one to study the topology of a manifold @xmath21 in terms of the analytical properties of suitable functions ( called morse functions ) @xmath29 .",

    "[ v ] shows that @xmath141 is proportional to @xmath4 , at least for the @xmath4 s considered here .",
    "the minimum gap is bounded from below by @xmath141 and from above by @xmath172 , so that it is proportional to @xmath4 .",

    "now we will discuss about the second theorem .",
    "if the ergodicity hypothesis were satisfied for all the @xmath15 s belonging to the region ( iii ) , then the sbpt would be located in the region ( ii ) for any @xmath72 .",
    "but since this is not true , the ergodicity can not be resort to explain the sb for @xmath177 , despite the fact that the @xmath15 s are topologically equivalent to an @xmath4-sphere .",

    "pts are regarded as a non - analytic point in the thermodynamic functions that arises in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "pts are not necessarily related to symmetry breaking . simplifying a little bit the picture , the theorem states that if a hamiltonian system with a potential which is confining , bounded from below , and short - range undergoes a pt , then a topological change has to occur in correspondence of the critical average potential @xmath167 of the pt .",

    "if we are in the second case , then @xmath167 can not be in correspondence of any critical @xmath15 because they are all topologically equivalent to an @xmath4-sphere .",
    "anyway , this dose not affect the theorem because the m - f @xmath0 model is a long - range system which does not satisfies a hypothesis of the theorem .",

    ", according to which two manifolds can be topologically equivalent at any @xmath4 but not asymptotic diffeomorphic as @xmath24 .",
    "this concept has been successfully applied to the @xmath97 @xmath0 model .",

    "we suggest that , if this were true , the hypotheses of the theorem may be enlarged to include also long - range potentials .",
    "in @xcite the @xmath179 model in m - f version and without interaction has been studied following the same procedure of this paper .",
    "we recall that the m - f @xmath179 model undergoes a second - order @xmath180-sbpt with classical critical exponent , as the m - f interaction requires .",
    "the thermodynamic critical average potential is in correspondence of a topological critical level at which a topological change occurs with critical points of all possible indexes , and the graph of the modulus of the euler characteristic @xmath181 shows a jump .",
    "obviously , @xmath181 has a jump at any critical level , but provided that @xmath4 is large enough it can be approximated by a continuous function . in the model without interaction no one of these behaviors shows . at converse , @xmath181 has a continuous shape everywhere .",
    "these results have suggested a strong relation between sbpts and topological changes , but this scenario does not seem confirmed by the results of the m - f @xmath0 model founded out here .",
    "@xmath181 shows a jump at @xmath141 followed by a very intricate shape and by an angular point at @xmath182 .",
    "@xmath141 never corresponds to the thermodynamic critical average potential , while @xmath182 corresponds only for a particular choice of @xmath72 .",
    "worst , this shape is showed even by the model without interaction where no sbpt occurs , even though the graph is more regular .",
    "we conclude that the scenario depicted by the m - f @xmath179 model is a particular case without any particular significance from a viewpoint of the relation between sbpt and topology of configuration space .",
    "in this paper we have analytically characterized the topology of the @xmath18 s of the m - f @xmath0 model and the same model without interaction by means of morse theory .",
    "then , we have tried to discover any possible link with the @xmath1-sbpt occurring in the m - f @xmath0 model . from a topological viewpoint",
    "we have not spotted any qualitative difference between the two models .",
    "the critical levels remain confined in an interval of the potential which is @xmath183 $ ] for the model without interaction and @xmath142 $ ] for the m - f model , where @xmath184 as @xmath72 increases .    despite the huge number of critical points growing as @xmath64 , but decreasing at the increasing of @xmath72 , in our opinion all that critical points",
    "do not have any particular significance except that to separate the region ( i ) , where the @xmath18 s are homeomorphic to two disjoint @xmath4-balls , from the region ( iii ) , where @xmath18 s are homeomorphic to an @xmath4-ball alone .",
    "this is true only in the m - f @xmath0 model , where the potential is double - well with the two absolute minima separated by a minimum gap proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "this is the effect of the m - f interaction and it is the very peculiar difference between the two models .",
    "indeed , the absolute minima of the model without interaction are @xmath185 and remain located at @xmath155 .",
    "we wonder weather the scenario of the m - f @xmath0 model may be transferred to any short - range version . in our opinion",
    "the answer is negative , because a double - well potential with minimum gap proportional to @xmath4 implies a non - concave graph of the microcanonical entropy @xmath186 , while in a short - range system it must be concave or non - strictly concave in the presence of a phase transition .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that for a short - range @xmath187-dimensional ising model the minimum gap is proportional to @xmath188 in the limit of large @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite the authors have found the potential of the nearest - neighbor @xmath97 version to have only three critical points , i.e. a saddle at the @xmath172-level set and two absolute minima at a level set proportional to @xmath189 , for values of the coupling constant @xmath72 large enough .",
    "let @xmath190 be the minimum value of @xmath72 for which the critical points are only three at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath190 allegedly goes as @xmath191 , so that , starting from @xmath190 and @xmath4 , new critical points , whose critical levels belong to @xmath192 , necessarily arise while increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this is not a proof that the minimum gap can not be proportional to @xmath4 , but if this were not true , then the minimum gap should be necessarily proportional to @xmath4 even in the nearest - neighbor @xmath97 version .",
    "another remarkable fact is that the sbpt occurs even in correspondence of @xmath15 s which are topological equivalent to an @xmath4-sphere .",
    "this means that a further sb mechanism must exist besides the topological one working for @xmath193 $ ] . in other words ,",
    "the ergodicity of a @xmath15 can not be guaranteed by the only assumption that it is homeomorphic to an @xmath4-sphere , as is already arisen from the @xmath97 @xmath0 model .",
    "further studies about the asymptotic diffeomorphicity @xcite of the @xmath15 in correspondence to the critical point may be a natural line of future research . to conclude",
    ", we hope that this work may give useful hints to deepen our understanding of the role of geometry and topology of configuration space in phase transitions phenomenon .",
    "morse theory links the topology of a given manifold @xmath21 with the properties of the critical points of smooth functions defined on it .",
    "two manifold @xmath21 and @xmath194 are topologically equivalent if they can be smoothly deformed one into the other , i.e. if there exists a _ diffeomorphism _ @xmath195 that maps @xmath21 into @xmath196 . here",
    "we consider only compact , finite - dimensional manifolds , but most of the results can be extended to non - compact manifolds .",
    "the key ingredient of morse theory is to consider the manifold @xmath21 as decomposed into the _ level sets _ of a function @xmath55 .",
    "we recall that the @xmath16-level set of @xmath29 is the set @xmath197 m being compact , any function @xmath55 has a minimum @xmath198 and a maximum @xmath199 , so that one can be build @xmath21 starting from @xmath200 and then adding continuously to it all other level surfaces up to @xmath201 .",
    "further , we define the part of m below @xmath202 as @xmath203 as @xmath202 is varied between @xmath198 and @xmath199 , @xmath204 describes the whole manifold @xmath21 .    for our purposes ,",
    "we need to restrict the class of functions into the class of _ morse functions _ , which are defined as follows .",

    "it can be proved also that the set of the morse functions are dense in the space of the smooth functions from @xmath21 to @xmath210 .",

    "the change undergone by the submanifolds @xmath204 as a critical level is passed is described using the concept of attaching handles. suppose that the critical level contains a critical point of index @xmath113 .",
