    "recently much attention is paid to the quantum information theories in the relativistic framework@xcite .",
    "the most remarkable fact in the inertial frames is the fact that entanglement of given multipartite quantum state is conserved although the entanglement between some degrees of freedom can be transfered to others@xcite . in non - inertial frames , however , the entanglement is in general degraded , which implies that the quantum correlation between rest and accelerating observers is reduced more and more with increasing the acceleration@xcite .",
    "the main reason for the reduction of the quantum correlation is that the accelerating observer located in one rindler wedge loses an information arising from the other rindler wedge due to the causally disconnected nature between the wedges .",
    "this means that some quantum information is leaked into other causally disconnected rindler space , which makes the reduction of the quantum correlation .",
    "in fact , this is a main scenario of the well - known unruh effect@xcite .",
    "recently , this unruh - type decoherence effect beyond the single - mode approximation is discussed in the context of the quantum information theories@xcite .",
    "more recently , the quantum entanglement in the black hole background is examined@xcite . especially , in ref.@xcite the hawking temperature - dependence of the bipartite entanglement is studied in the arbitrary spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black hole background .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the quantum discord@xcite and the tripartite entanglement in the same black hole background .",
    "throughout this paper we use @xmath2 .",
    "the metric we consider in this paper is @xmath3 where the functions @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 satisfy @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the line element ( [ metric1 ] ) includes the various black holes such as schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes . the hawking temperature in this metric is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a surface gravity defined as @xmath12 .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite one can consider three - different vacuum states @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in this background .",
    "first two vacuum states are the fock vacua inside and outside horizon , respectively , and the last one is the kruskal vacuum outside the event horizon .",
    "the interrelation between these vacua is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19-particle states constructed from @xmath13 and @xmath14 by operating the corresponding creation operators @xmath19 times , and @xmath20 is a frequency of the scalar field .",
    "applying the creation operator of the kruskal spacetime in eq .",
    "( [ inter-0 ] ) and using the bogoliubov coefficients , one can construct @xmath21 , whose expression is @xmath22",
    "quantum discord@xcite is a measure for _ quantumness _ of given bipartite quantum state .",
    "usually these two parties consist of system and corresponding apparatus . in this paper , however , we will call these parties as alice and bob .",
    "we will examine in this section how the quantum discord is changed in the presence of the black hole ( [ metric1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that initially alice and bob share a entangled state @xmath23 in the asymptotic region .",
    "after sharing , bob moves to the near - horizon region with his own particle detector while alice stays in the asymptotic region .",
    "since , then , the bob s detector registers only thermally excited particles due to the hawking effect , bob s state can be represented by tensor product of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states .",
    "however , since the inside region of the black hole is causally disconnected from alice and bob , we have to take a partial trace over @xmath24state .",
    "then , the state between alice and bob becomes a mixed state whose density matrix becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 it is worthwhile noting @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "now , we discuss the quantum discord .",
    "we assume that alice performs a projective measurement with a complete set of the measurement operators @xmath30 .",
    "the usual mutual information between alice and bob is @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the von neumann entropy @xmath33 . in our paper , all logarithms",
    "are taken to base @xmath34 .",
    "the classical analogue of eq .",
    "( [ mutual1 ] ) is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the shannon entropy . in classical information theories different representation of the mutual information",
    "is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the conditional entropy of @xmath39 given @xmath40 .",
    "the quantum analogue of this representation@xcite is @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes a complete set of the measurement operators prepared by the party @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a von neumann entropy of the party @xmath45 after the party @xmath43 has a measurement outcome @xmath46 . of course , @xmath47 is a probability for getting outcome @xmath46 in the quantum measurement .",
    "usual quantum mechanical postulates@xcite imply @xmath48 where @xmath49 . unlike @xmath50 ,",
    "therefore , @xmath51 is dependent on the complete set of the measurement operators .",
    "the quantum discord is defined as @xmath52 = \\min \\left[s(a ) - s(a , b ) + \\sum_j p_j s(b | \\pi_j^a ) \\right],\\ ] ] where minimum is taken over all possible complete set of the measurement operators .",

    "i.e. @xmath80 , @xmath50 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 approach to @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the remarkable fact is that the classical correlation is less than the quantum discord in the full range of hawking temperature .",
    "similar behavior was derived when the classical correlation and quantum discord sharing of dirac field are discussed in the non - inertial frame@xcite . in next section",
    "we will discuss on the tripartite entanglement in the presence of the black hole ( [ metric1 ] ) .",
    "the most well - known measure for the tripartite entanglement is a three - tangle@xcite . since , however , the three - tangle is not defined in the qudit system , we can not use it because of eq .",
    "( [ inter-0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ inter-1 ] ) .",
