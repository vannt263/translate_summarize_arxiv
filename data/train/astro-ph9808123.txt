    "the effort to investigate low - level nuclear activity in nearby galaxies has proceeded along two separate , largely independent routes .",
    "the more direct and traditional approach utilizes optical spectroscopy of magnitude - limited samples , usually without highly restrictive selection by hubble type ( see ho 1996 for a review ) .",
    "these surveys arrive at the consensus that mild nuclear activity attributable to the phenomenon of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is very common in nearby galaxies , particularly those with a prominent bulge component . along similar lines ,",
    "sensitive radio interferometric observations have revealed intrinsically weak nuclear sources in an increasingly large number of purportedly `` normal '' galaxies ( e.g. , heeschen 1970 ; ekers & ekers 1973 ; crane 1979 ; van der hulst , crane , & keel 1981 ; condon 1982 ) .",
    "to date , the most comprehensive surveys for weak , compact nuclear radio emission have concentrated on elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "( as a working definition , `` compact '' here denotes angular scales 5 , which , for the relatively nearby galaxies addressed in this paper , pertain to physical dimensions of several hundred parsecs . )",
    "the two main studies are those by sadler ( 1989 ) and wrobel & heeschen ( 1991 , hereafter wh ) , which selected southern and northern sources , respectively ; both employed the very large array ( vla ) at an observing frequency of 5  ghz ( 6  cm ) , which resulted in a synthesized beam with an angular resolution of  @xmath05 .",
    "both of these studies achieved sensitivities well below 1  mjy and detected a large number of previously unknown , low - power radio cores associated with the galaxy nuclei .",
    "some of the newly discovered sources have radio powers as low as 10@xmath1 w hz@xmath2 at 5  ghz , many orders of magnitude less than the cores of classical radio galaxies or quasars .    what is the physical nature of these low - power radio cores in nearby early - type galaxies ? are they truly scaled - down versions of distant , more powerful agns , or can they be explained by less exotic processes ?",
    "sadler ( 1989 ) favored the agn interpretation on the basis of optical spectroscopic information available for their sample .",
    "subsequent radio observations by slee ( 1994 ) of a radio - bright subset at a much higher angular resolution revealed that most of the radio emission originates from extremely small , parsec - scale cores .",
    "the high brightness temperatures inferred ( @xmath3 k ) and the preponderance of flat radio spectra support a nonthermal origin for the emission , at least for the brightest sources they selected .",
    "the situation for the northern objects , however , is less clear , for , until recently , optical spectra were not widely available for the wh sample . and unlike the southern sample , there are yet no systematic follow - up radio observations with sufficient angular resolution to yield meaningful constraints on the brightness temperature , nor are there , in general , spectral indices to diagnose the emission mechanism .",
    "the wh sample contains fewer high - luminosity galaxies than the sample of sadler et al . because the former is selected both by magnitude and by distance .",
    "since the physical origin of nuclear activity depends on galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , phillips 1986 ; ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997b ) , the results of the southern survey can not be readily generalized to the northern survey .",
    "indeed , wh argued , on the basis of an observed correlation between the radio and the far - infrared emission , that star formation , not agn activity , predominantly powers the nuclei in their sample .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the nature of the radio nuclei in the wh sample of early - type galaxies with the aid of a newly completed optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "we will argue that the bulk of the radio emission arises from accretion - powered activity , as was proposed by sadler ( 1989 ) for the southern counterpart of the wh survey .",
    "the wh sample formally comprises 216 elliptical and s0 galaxies ( @xmath4 1 ) in the center for astrophysics redshift survey ( huchra 1983 ) that satisfy @xmath5 14 mag and @xmath6 3000  ( see wrobel 1991 ) .",
    "this sample naturally overlaps heavily with the palomar optical spectroscopic survey of ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1995 , 1997a ) , which selected galaxies from the revised shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tammann 1981 ) having @xmath7 12.5 mag and declinations @xmath80 .",
    "the palomar survey contains 145 e and s0 galaxies , and 109 of these ( 38 e and 71 s0 ) are in common with the wh sample .",
    "figure 1 shows the fractional radio luminosity function of the 109 objects calculated using the kaplan - meier estimator ( feigelson & nelson 1985 ) to take into account the significant number of upper limits ( 69 ) present .",
    "the fractional luminosity functions of ellipticals and s0s are also shown separately to reinforce the well - known fact ( e.g. , sadler 1989 ) that the strength of the radio source increases with the size of the bulge component .",
    "the mean 5-ghz radio power is ( 2.1@xmath91.3 ) w hz@xmath2 for the entire sample , ( 5.5@xmath93.7 ) w hz@xmath2 for the ellipticals alone , and ( 0.3@xmath90.1 ) w hz@xmath2 for the s0s alone .    ho ( 1997a )",
    "give a variety of spectroscopic parameters measured for the nuclear regions ; the angular scale of these measurements ( 2@xmath104 ) roughly matches that of the radio synthesized beam .",
    "for the present purpose , the most pertinent of the parameters are the spectral classifications of the nuclei and their luminosities as measured in the h   emission line .",
    "the following analysis uses the distances given in ho ( 1997a ) , which are based on @xmath11 = 75   mpc@xmath2 .",
    "as described by ho ( 1997a , 1997b ) , the palomar survey distinguishes four classes of emission - line nuclei :  nuclei , seyfert nuclei , low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; heckman 1980 ) , and transition objects ( composite liner+  nucleus ) .",
    "a minority of nuclei do not have detectable emission lines down to an equivalent - width limit of @xmath00.25  .",
    "the primary spectral classification system is based solely on the relative intensities of the narrow optical emission lines .",
    "nuclei , whose spectra closely resemble those of  regions and are therefore assumed to be photoionized by young , massive stars , have relatively weak lines of  6300 , 6363 ,  6548 , 6583 , and   6716 , 6731 ( compared to , say , h ) .",
    "the other three groups , which represent variants of agns , are recognized by their exceptionally strong low - ionization lines of , , and .",
    "liners differ from seyferts by their level of excitation , as measured by the ratio of  5007 to h , and transition objects have spectra intermediate between those of liners and  nuclei .",
    "some members within each of the agn classes show evidence for a weak broad ( widths of several thousand ) h  emission line ( ho 1997c ) , and these are designated `` type 1 '' objects .",
    "table 1 gives a breakdown of the spectral classification of the objects in common with the wh survey .",
    "the first point to notice is that a substantial fraction of the galaxies ( 61% ) have detectable emission lines , in agreement with the high detection rate reported by phillips ( 1986 ) for the southern sample .",
    "the somewhat higher detection rate of the palomar sample results from its greater sensitivity and the smaller average distance of the objects .",
    "second , nuclei with emission lines are at least ten times more likely to be detected in the radio than those without emission lines .",
    "the fraction of emission - line nuclei detected in the radio is 57% , compared with 5% for nuclei not detected in emission , a difference significant at a level of @xmath899.99% according to the @xmath12 for the 2@xmath102 contingency table for these results .",
    "expressed in another way , of the 40 nuclei detected in the radio , 38 ( 95% ) have optical emission lines , whereas among the 69 nuclei with radio upper limits , only 29 ( 42% ) do .",
    "galaxies detected as radio sources , therefore , have a much higher likelihood of being detected in optical emission lines , and vice versa .",
    "this is further reflected in the large difference between the strengths of the emission lines : the galaxies detected as radio sources have an average extinction - corrected h  luminosity ( properly accounting for upper limits ) , of ( 4.2@xmath91.1 ) , one order of magnitude higher than the radio - undetected galaxies , which have an average @xmath13(h ) = ( 3.9@xmath90.9 ) .",
    "most revealing , however , is the fact that the vast majority of the emission - line nuclei ( 59/67 or @xmath090% ) are spectroscopically classified as agns .",
    "the active nuclei are extremely faint in comparison to traditionally - studied agns ( fig .",
    "2 ) ; the average @xmath13(h ) is only @xmath02 . the elliptical galaxies exhibit lower levels of optical line emission than the s0s [ average @xmath13(h ) = 0.8  vs. 2.5 ] , probably reflecting a difference in the central gas content between the two morphological types .",
    "the typical electron density of the emission - line regions in these objects , as estimated from the  6716 , 6731 doublet , is 200300 , which , when combined with the h  luminosities , imply an ionized hydrogen mass of @xmath010@xmath14 .",
    "most of the agns belong to the low - ionization category , namely liners and liner/   composites , as is the case in spiral galaxies ( ho 1997b ) .",
    "the fraction of agns occupied by liners among elliptical and s0 galaxies , 85% , is somewhat higher than among spirals , which is @xmath070% ( ho 1997b ) .",
    "the preponderance of liners in galaxies with the earliest hubble types and the tendency for the most compact radio cores to be found in bulge - dominated systems ( e.g. , sadler 1995 ) no doubt leads to the common suggestion , first made by heckman ( 1980 ) , that there exists a statistical connection between liners and compact radio sources .",
    "indeed , disney & cromwell ( 1971 ) had remarked , before heckman coined the term `` liner , '' on the unusually low ionization state of the spectra in their sample of elliptical galaxies with radio - bright nuclei .",
    "however , liners certainly exist in more diverse environments than just early - type galaxies , and it should be stressed that a preferred association between compact radio cores and the liner phenomenon has not yet been established unambiguously .",
    "hummel ( 1990 ) , who analyzed a galaxy sample with a more representative mixture of hubble types , did _ not _ find a statistically higher incidence of compact radio emission in liners compared to  nuclei . in the present sample ,",
    "the radio detection rate in  nuclei ( 50% ) is also very similar to that in agns ( 58% ) ; furthermore , the radio detection rate does not appear to depend on the agn class .",
    "the statistics based on our sample alone should be taken as tentative because of the small number of  nuclei ( 8) and seyferts ( 9 ) available . when combined with the findings of hummel et al .",
    ", however , they strongly suggest that the presence or absence of nuclear radio emission , at least on a scale of several hundred parsecs , is _ not _ a reliable discriminator between agns and star - forming nuclei or between various optical classes of agns . observations at higher angular resolution may be needed to better isolate a central point source , if present , and spectral information may help to identify the emission mechanism .",
    "nuclei rarely exist in elliptical galaxies ; none , in fact , are found in the present sample or in the entire palomar survey ( ho 1997b ) .",
    "likewise , the nuclei in the vast majority of the s0 galaxies are also optically identified with agns rather than  nuclei .",
    "the eight s0 galaxies with  nuclei in table 1 , which comprise less than 20% of the s0s with emission - line nuclei , stand out as having somewhat lower optical luminosities ( by about 1 mag ) than those classified as agns .",
    "thus , insofar as the optical spectral classification of a nucleus gives a reliable indication of its dominant central energy source , our results , in conjunction with those of sadler ( 1989 ) , indicate that nonstellar activity from agns , not star formation , powers the weak radio cores commonly found in nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "several older studies have reported an association of compact radio emission with the presence of optical emission lines in the centers of early - type galaxies ( disney & cromwell 1971 ; ekers & ekers 1973 ; oconnell & dressel 1978 ) . the sample analyzed in this paper supports this result with the finding that both the incidence and the strength of optical emission lines are correlated with the presence of radio emission . although there is a large range of radio power ( @xmath15 ) at any fixed h  luminosity [ @xmath13(h ) ] , the two quantities appear correlated when the upper limits are properly taken into account ( fig .",
    "3 ) ; the correlation holds for ellipticals and s0s individually and for both types combined . the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath13(h ) for the ellipticals appears offset and possibly steeper than that for the s0s . for a given line luminosity",
    ", ellipticals have stronger radio sources than s0s do , although the spread within each morphological type and the overlap between the two are considerable .",
    "the error bars in the lower right corner of the diagram give an estimate of the typical uncertainty associated with the data , although three additional factors most likely further contribute to the scatter in the plot .",
    "first , the core radio emission is likely to be at least moderately variable .",
    "second , as discussed at length in ho ( 1997a ) , some individual h   measurements in the palomar survey can be quite uncertain because of slit losses and imperfect photometric calibration . and finally ,",
    "although the h  luminosities have been corrected for galactic and internal extinction , the latter contribution is not always unambiguous in weak emission - line objects because the balmer decrement , on which the correction depends , can be difficult to determine accurately .",
    "as emphasized by sadler ( 1989 ) , it is nontrivial to assess the statistical relation between @xmath15 and @xmath13(h ) because each quantity is itself correlated with the distance and with the total optical luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "a possible correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath13(h ) in the presence of one of these third variables was evaluated using the test for partial correlation with censored data described by akritas & siebert ( 1996 ) .",
    "choosing the total blue absolute magnitude as the test variable , we find that @xmath15 correlates very significantly with @xmath13(h ) .",
    "the partial kendall s @xmath16 coefficient is 0.299 and the variance is 0.0432 ( see akritas & siebert ) , which imply that the null hypothesis that @xmath15 and @xmath13(h ) are uncorrelated can be rejected at a significance level of @xmath17 ; the same holds if distance becomes the test variable . in both cases",
    "the correlation is stronger for s0s than for ellipticals , but the correlation for the latter is still highly significant .",
    "these results conflict with those of sadler ( 1989 ) , who concluded that early - type galaxies with radio cores do not have a higher incidence of optical emission lines than those without radio cores and that radio power is not correlated with optical emission - line luminosity .",
    "these authors used a likelihood ratio test based on a maximum - likelihood estimate of the bivariate luminosity function of @xmath15 and @xmath13 ( ) , where @xmath13 ( ) is the luminosity of the  6583 emission line , and found that the two variables are not strongly correlated , even _ without _ accounting for the known partial correlation of each with a third variable ( distance or total galaxy luminosity ) . to try to understand the root of this discrepancy , ( )",
    "is substituted for @xmath13(h ) .",
    "we chose to use @xmath13(h ) instead of @xmath13 ( ) because a luminosity based on a recombination line has a more straightforward physical interpretation than a collisionally - excited line . ] the data of sadler et al .",
    "were reanalyzed using the same statistical method employed here .",
    "table 4 of sadler et al .",
    "lists 167 objects having both radio and optical data , with 123 upper limits for @xmath15 and 76 upper limits for @xmath13 ( ) .",
    "the conventional generalized kendall s @xmath16 test ( isobe , feigelson , & nelson 1986 ) yields a correlation coefficient of 0.189 and a significance level of 4 .",
    "thus , contrary to the conclusion of sadler et al . ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath13 ( ) _ are _ highly correlated .",
    "the same conclusion holds even after allowing for dependence on a third variable . taking the total absolute magnitude of the galaxy again as the test variable",
    ", the partial kendall s @xmath16 test formally yields a rather small correlation coefficient of 0.0679 ( variance = 0.0223 ) , but it is still statistically significant ( the null hypothesis can be rejected with a probability of 0.2% ) . it is unclear why the statistical method used by sadler et al . gives an inconsistent result .",
    "akritas ( 1997 ) notes that the asymptotic distribution that sadler et al . assume for their likelihood ratio statistic ( equation b8 in their appendix b )",
    "is known to be formally valid only for uncensored data ; its behavior in the presence of censoring is unknown .",
    "the majority of the radio sources in the wh sample do not yet have published radio spectral indices or meaningful constraints on their brightness temperatures to enable discrimination between a thermal or nonthermal origin for the radio emission . in this regard ,",
    "it is instructive to consider a constraint that can be derived from the strength of the h  emission , which is sampled roughly over the same region as the vla measurements .",
    "a purely thermal source with an electron temperature of 10@xmath14 k generates approximately 10@xmath18 @xmath13(h ) w hz@xmath2 of radio power at 5  ghz ( see , e.g. , ulvestad , wilson , & sramek 1981 ) , with @xmath13(h ) expressed in units of w. figure 4 illustrates that the vast majority of the sources fall well above this threshold , which implies that thermal emission contributes negligibly to the radio continuum at this frequency .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that the nuclei are agns , although such an interpretation is not required because supernova remnants can generate nonthermal radio emission .",
    "the objects that lie near the threshold are all s0 galaxies , most being systems of fairly low luminosity ( @xmath19 19.5 mag ) .",
    "several of the s0s with  nuclei , notably , have radio powers consistent with the thermal limit , although not all the objects near this limit are classified as  nuclei .",
    "more generally , there exists a loose correlation between the radio `` excess '' and the galaxy luminosity .",
    "the objects with the largest ratio of radio to optical line luminosity tend to be the most luminous , massive galaxies , although there is a considerable spread of this ratio at any given total luminosity .",
    "( as discussed above in connection with figure 3 , the intrinsic scatter is likely to be smaller than indicated because of observational factors . )",
    "the positive correlation between radio power and optical emission - line luminosity in itself , however , does not point to an obvious physical explanation for such a relationship .",
    "a correlation between 20-cm radio power and the luminosity of the  5007 forbidden line has been recognized for quite some time in seyfert galaxies ( de bruyn & wilson 1978 ; whittle 1992b ) , most of which have much higher luminosities than the objects considered here , but even in those objects the physical connection between the two variables is not obvious . whittle ( 1992b ) finds that both radio power and emission - line luminosity are strongly coupled to the bulge luminosity , but a residual correlation remains , as is the case here .",
    "powerful radio galaxies also exhibit a correlation between radio power and optical emission - line luminosity ( hine & longair 1979 ; rawlings 1989 ; baum & heckman 1989b ; baum , zirbel , & odea 1995 ; zirbel & baum 1995 ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether the low - luminosity nuclei in our sample extend the radio - power / line - luminosity correlations previously established for the more powerful agns .",
    "specifically , one might expect the radio - quiet ellipticals in our sample to track the radio galaxies because they latter are predominantly giant ellipticals ( e.g. , ledlow & owen 1995 ; zirbel 1996 ) ; the sos , on the other hand , might follow the seyfert population , whose host galaxies tend to be bulge - dominated disk systems ( e.g. , whittle 1992a ; ho 1997b ) .",
    "the best - fitting relations between radio power and line luminosity found by zirbel & baum ( 1995 ) are plotted on figure 3 .",
    "radio galaxies of fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) `` class i '' and `` class ii '' obey slightly different relations , and both are shown .",
    "the line luminosities used by zirbel & baum ( 1995 ) represent the sum of the h  and the  6548 , 6583 lines . to translate their results for this comparison",
    ", we assume that  6548 , 6583 = 2.3h , the median value observed in elliptical and s0 galaxies by ho ( 1997a ) .",
    "the best - fitting lines shown are those for the core radio power , since in the wh sample most of the radio emission comes from a compact core , and they were derived from objects with @xmath20 .",
    "note that , in the units used in figure 3 , the objects in the zirbel & baum sample have log @xmath21 2127 and log @xmath13(h ) @xmath22 38.544.5 .",
    "we have also include in the plot the sample of seyfert nuclei compiled by whittle ( 1992a ) ; most of these objects are significantly more luminous than those in our sample .",
    "again , for comparison with our data , we computed @xmath23 from whittle s 1.4-ghz flux densities assuming @xmath24 , and we calculated @xmath13(h ) from his  luminosities by assuming  5007/h   = 10 and h / h  = 3.1 , values typical of seyfert nuclei ( e.g. , shuder & osterbrock 1981 ) .    making allowance for the large scatter in the diagram , the nearby radio - quiet ellipticals broadly follow the faint end of the relations established by the radio galaxies .",
    "the sos , on the other hand , appear to join fairly well with the faint end of the seyfert galaxy sequence , which , as was noticed by baum & heckman ( 1989b ) , is distinctly offset from the radio galaxy sequence .",
    "a simple interpretation of these results is that the quiescent nuclei in nearby early - type galaxies are the low - luminosity counterparts of the more distant , more powerful agns .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the spectroscopic evidence presented in   2 .",
    "the spectra of the nuclei , with only a few exceptions , decidedly do not resemble the spectra of  regions ; instead , most of them look like those of liners .",
    "if one adopts the viewpoint that most liners represent another , and perhaps the most common , manifestation of the agn phenomenon ( e.g. , halpern & steiner 1983 ; ferland & netzer 1983 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1993 ; see reviews by filippenko 1996 and ho 1998 ) , one would conclude that the weak , compact radio emission in the centers of nearby early - type galaxies derives from physical processes similar to those operating in more powerful agns . in turn , the finding that many nearby early - type galaxies do , in fact , contain high - brightness temperature , flat - spectrum radio cores ( slee 1994 ) provides strong support for the agn - like nature of liners , at least for those found in elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "we have used optical spectroscopic information to interpret the nature of the compact radio emission in a sample of nearby early - type ( elliptical and s0 ) galaxies surveyed with the vla by wrobel & heeschen ( 1991 ) .",
    "many of these galaxies have weak radio sources ( 1few mjy at 5  ghz ) on scales of several hundred parsecs or less , some with radio powers as low as 10@xmath1 w hz@xmath2 .",
    "the radio sources in ellipticals are more luminous than those in s0s because the radio power increases with the optical luminosity of the bulge component .",
    "a substantial fraction of the galaxies ( @xmath060% ) show detectable levels of optical nebulosity down to very sensitive limits ( @xmath00.25   equivalent width for the h  emission line ) over the same physical scale probed by the radio observations .",
    "the measured h  luminosities , 10@xmath2510@xmath26 , imply the presence of 10@xmath2710@xmath28  of warm ( 10@xmath14 k ) ionized hydrogen . among s0 galaxies ,",
    "the quantity of ionized gas increases with galaxy luminosity ( or size ) , but , as a class , ellipticals have less ionized gas than s0s .",
    "the amount of thermal gas implied by the h  measurements falls short of producing , by large factors in most cases , the observed radio continuum luminosity .",
    "most of the radio emission is therefore nonthermal .",
    "both the incidence and the strength of optical line emission correlate with the radio power . at a fixed line luminosity ,",
    "ellipticals have stronger radio cores than s0s .",
    "the relation between radio power and line emission in the nearby radio - quiet ellipticals appears to be an extension of a similar relation seen in powerful radio galaxies .",
    "the s0s , on the other hand , follow the faint end the correlation established by luminous seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is suggested that the weak nuclear sources seen in nearby early - type galaxies are simply the low - luminosity counterparts of more distant , luminous agns .",
    "the spectroscopic evidence supports this interpretation .",
