    "descriptions of optical excitation of few - state quantum systems traditionally make use of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , in which the hilbert - space unit vectors ( the bare quantum states ) rotate with angular velocities that are fixed at various laser carrier frequencies , and the hamiltonian , with the neglect of rapidly varying terms , becomes a matrix of slowly varying rabi frequencies and detunings @xcite . for three states the usual electric - dipole selection rules of optical transitions produce a simple chain of inter - state linkages , depicted as either a ladder , a lambda or a vee .",
    "for some time it has been known that , either by means of a rotation of the arbitrary quantization axis for defining magnetic sublevels , or by more general reorganization of the hilbert - state basis states ( a morris - shore transformation @xcite ) , such patterns can be presented as a set of independent two - state excitations ( bright states ) together with spectator states that are unaffected by the specific radiation ( dark states or spectator states ) .",
    "the presence of a third interaction , linking the two states that terminate the three - state chain , turns the linkage pattern into a loop , see fig .",
    "[ fig - loop3 ] .",
    "such interaction would violate the usual selection rules for electric - dipole radiation ( which connects only states of opposite parity ) , but is possible for a variety of other interactions , such as occur with two - photon optical transitions or microwave transitions between hyperfine states . to avoid the presence of rapidly varying exponential phases in the rwa hamiltonian",
    ", such a link should occur with carrier frequency suitably chosen .    within the rwa",
    "there is no longer a distinction of the original bare - state energies ; all that matters is the detunings , i.e. differences between a bohr frequency and the associated laser - field carrier frequency .",
    "nonetheless , it is traditional , when depicting the linkage pattern of laser - induced interactions , to place representations of the states in a vertical direction ranked according to the original bare - state energies , and to consider excitation in which the initial population resides entirely in a ground state .",
    "such display convention is particularly useful in emphasizing the difference between low - energy stable or metastable states , unable to radiatively decay , and excited states , from which spontaneous emission is possible  visible as fluorescence .",
    "the three - state loop is the simplest example of discrete quantum states that can exhibit nontrivial probability - amplitude interferences , and hence it has attracted continuing interest @xcite .    with the loop pattern",
    "it is not immediately obvious that any simple restructuring of the hilbert - space coordinates will produce a single unit vector that is immune to the effects of any interaction  a spectator state .",
    "for example , the loop system does not satisfy an essential condition for the ms transformation @xcite , namely that the quantum states be classified in two sets , with transitions only between the sets , not within them .",
    "a special case of the three - state loop was considered by carroll and hioe @xcite .",
    "they presented analytical solutions for the probability amplitudes when three resonant laser pulses of different shapes were present and two of the couplings where real , while the third was purely imaginary .",
    "for this special case , the underlying su(2 ) symmetry allows the three - state loop to be reduced to an effective two - state system .",
    "another fully resonant three - state loop was examined by unanyan _",
    "_ @xcite . in that work a pulsed quasistatic magnetic field supplemented the two optical pulses of a lambda linkage used for stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "this additional field provided a supplement to the usual adiabatic constraints and allowed a reduction of diabatic loss , thereby improving the usual adiabatic constraints on achieving complete population transfer .",
    "the three - state loop was examined also by fleischhauer _",
    "they showed that when each link was resonant , the dark state of stirap @xcite could be modified to a higher - order trapping state , becoming an approximate constant of motion even for small pulse areas .",
    "this state adiabatically rotates , in hilbert space , from the initial to the target state .",
    "this adiabatic motion leads to efficient population transfer , though at the expense of placing some population into the decaying atomic state .",
    "recently a three - state loop was shown to occur in physical processes where the free - space symmetry is broken , as it is in chiral systems @xcite .",
    "such quantum systems occur in left- and right - handed chiral molecules @xcite , or in `` artificial atoms '' .",
    "loop linkages amongst discrete quantum states can also occur in superconducting quantum circuits @xcite , and in modeling entangled atoms coupled through an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "we here consider loops that have less stringent constraints on the frequencies , although some do exist .",
    "we shall show in the following that it is possible , under appropriate conditions ( including three - photon resonance ) , to break the loop into a chain .",
    "a further transformation of the basis states can then convert the linkage pattern into a pair of coupled states and a spectator state .",
    "alternatively , if the population resides initially in the middle state of the chain , the system has the dynamics of the vee linkage .    the required initial transformation , converting the loop into a simple chain , is taken to be a householder reflection ( hr ) of the hamiltonian matrix @xcite .",
    "such matrix manipulations , commonplace in works dealing with linear algebra @xcite , have recently been applied to quantum - state manipulations @xcite .    when acting upon an _ arbitrary _ square matrix a suitable sequence of hrs produces an upper - diagonal ( or lower - diagonal ) matrix .",
    "when acting upon a _ unitary _ matrix , such a sequence produces a diagonal matrix , with phase factors on the diagonal .",
    "this property has been used for decomposition , and therefore synthesis , of arbitrary preselected propagators in multistate systems @xcite .",
    "we show here that , when utilised for a change of basis in hilbert space , a suitable hr ( or a sequence of hrs ) can cast a ( hermitian ) hamiltonian into a tridiagonal form .",
    "this tridiagonalization implies the replacement of a general linkage pattern ( for example , each state interacting with any other state ) with an effective chainwise - connected system where only nearest - neighbour interactions are present .",
    "we here apply this tridiagonalization to the simplest nontrivial multistate system  a three - state loop system  and demonstrate its potential applications , with examples ranging from effective chain breaking and novel spectator states to hidden two - photon resonances .",
    "we consider three fields , labelled pump ( @xmath1 ) , stokes ( @xmath2 ) , and control ( @xmath3 ) , _",
    "k(t ) = _ k _ k(t ) ( _ k t + _ k ) , ( k = p , s , c ) . the three carrier frequencies @xmath4 can be chosen arbitrarily , so long as they fulfill the three - photon resonance condition ( fig .",
    "[ fig - loop3 ] ) _ c - _ p + _ s = 0 .",
    "[ eqn-3phot ] this constraint is necessary for the application of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite .",
    "however , at the outset we impose no constraints on the single - photon detunings , _",
    "p e_2-e_1 -_p,_se_2-e_3-_s .",
    "we introduce probability amplitudes @xmath5 in the usual rotating hilbert - space coordinates @xmath6 , ( t ) = ( - i _ 0 t ) , where the rotations originate with field carrier frequencies , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . from the time - dependent schrdinger equation we obtain three coupled equations ( t ) = -i ( t ) ( t ) , where @xmath9^{t}$ ] is a three - component column vector of probability amplitudes and @xmath10 is the slowly varying rwa hamiltonian .",
    "we take the overall phase factor @xmath11 to nullify the first diagonal element of the rwa hamiltonian matrix ; it then has the structure [ h - loop ] ( t)=. where the interactions are parameterized by slowly varying real - valued rabi frequencies @xmath12 , for @xmath13 . for simplicity and without loss of generality the @xmath3 field",
    "is assumed real ( @xmath14 ) ; then @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the phase differences between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 fields , respectively , and the @xmath3 field .",
    "the cumulative detunings are _",
    "2=_p,_3 = _ p-_s .",
    "we seek a unitary transformation of the hilbert - space basis states that will first replace the loop with a three - state chain .",
    "as we will show , the desired result can be produced by a householder reflection acting upon the rwa hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-dimensional householder reflection is defined as the operator = - 2vv , where @xmath17 is the identity operator and @xmath18 is an @xmath0-dimensional normalized complex column vector .",
    "the householder operator @xmath19 is hermitian and unitary , @xmath20 , hence @xmath19 is involutary , @xmath21 .",
    "the transformation is a reflection , so @xmath22 . if the vector @xmath18 is real , the householder reflection has a simple geometric interpretation : it is a reflection with respect to an @xmath23-dimensional plane normal to the vector @xmath18 .",
    "the householder reflection , acting upon an arbitrary @xmath24-dimensional matrix , uses @xmath25 operations to produce an upper or lower triangular matrix .",
    "this behavior makes the householder reflection a powerful tool for many applications in classical data analysis , e.g. , in solving systems of linear algebraic equations , finding eigenvalues of high - dimensional matrices , least - squares optimization , qr decomposition , etc . @xcite . for us ,",
    "the reflection serves to transform the hamiltonian from a full matrix to one that lacks one interaction ",
    "it breaks the loop into a chain .",
    "the three - state system offers three basis vectors with which to define a householder reflection . because of the symmetry of the loop system it is only necessary to consider one of these ; the effect of others can be examined by a permutation of state labels .",
    "we shall take state @xmath26 as a fixed coordinate , within the plane of the reflection , and introduce an alteration of the hilbert subspace spanned by the remaining unit vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig - househ ] illustrates the connection of the reflection with the basis states , and the possible choices of initial state .    with this choice the householder vector reads [ householder vector ] |v= ^t , and the matrix representation of the householder reflection is = . the angle @xmath29 , defined by the equation [ theta ] , is twice the angle from the mirror normal to state @xmath30 ( i.e. the twist of the mirror about the @xmath26 axis ) .",
    "hereafter we omit explicit mention of time dependences ; all rabi frequencies are to be considered slowly varying in time , as is the householder reflection @xmath31 and the angle @xmath29 .",
    "the connection between the probability amplitudes @xmath32 in the householder basis and the amplitudes @xmath33 in the original ( bare ) basis is = .",
    "the transformed equation of motion reads = -i , where the householder hamiltonian is @xmath34 , with an overdot denoting a time derivative .",
    "explicitly , [ hh ] = , with effective detunings [ hdelta]_2 & = & , [ hdelta2 ] + _ 3 & = & , [ hdelta3 ] and effective couplings [ homega]_p & = & e^i_p,[homegap ] + _ s & = & 1 ^ 2 , [ homegas ] with @xmath35 .",
    "all of these elements acquire time dependence from the pulses , though that is not shown explicitly .",
    "the hamiltonian in the householder basis is that of a simple chain , @xmath36 . by design the householder reflection places the original two interactions of state @xmath26 into a single effective interaction with a new superposition state @xmath37 .",
    "this state , in turn , has an interaction with the other terminal state of the chain @xmath38 , also a superposition state . the new _ householder states _",
    "@xmath39 are superpositions of the original basis states @xmath40 , [ householder states ] & = & , [ householder state 1 ] + & = & + e^-i_p , [ householder state 2 ] + & = & e^i_p - [ householder state 3 ] .",
    "when the initial population resides entirely in state @xmath26 , this chain is equivalent to a lambda or ladder system .",
    "when the initial population occurs in state @xmath37 it is a generalization of the vee linkage .",
    "the chain hamiltonian in the householder representation is conceptually simpler than the original loop hamiltonian for it allows only for nearest - neighbour interactions ; the resulting chain linkage is easier to understand and treat analytically by a variety of exact or approximate approaches .",
    "the inherent interference in the loop system is now imprinted onto the householder transformation and is absent in the householder chain . moreover",
    ", this tranformation allows one to use the considerable literature available on chainwise - connected three - state systems .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we consider special cases of the householder hamiltonian , obtained when we constrain the various pulse parameters , which lead to simplification of the resulting hamiltonian matrix .",
    "two simplifications are particularly interesting : ( i ) breaking the three - state householder chain @xmath36 into a two - state system and a spectator state , and ( ii ) two - photon resonance in the householder basis .",
    "we shall identify conditions , and deduce implications , for these important special cases .      under appropriate conditions the three - state householder chain @xmath36 breaks into two coupled states and a spectator state .",
    "this occurs whenever one of the householder linkages vanishes .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath41 requires that both @xmath42 and @xmath43 vanish , which is trivial and uninteresting .",
    "we hence assume the null linkage to be the coupling between states @xmath37 and @xmath38 , [ h23=0 ] _ s + 2i e^-i_p = 0 . under this condition state @xmath38 , eq .",
    ", decouples from the other two states and becomes a _ spectator state _ : its population is trapped , within a subspace of the full hilbert space .",
    "the population distribution between states @xmath30 and @xmath44 may change , but in a manner that conserves the population of the spectator state .      one possible solution to eq",
    ".   reads [ breaking conditions]_2 & = & _ 3 , [ beaking condition 1 ] + _ p & = & -_s- , [ breaking condition 2 ] + _ s & = & -2 . [ breaking condition 3 ] the latter condition imposes a strict constraint on the pulse shape .",
    "given @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which determine @xmath45 through eq .  , condition determines both the shape and the magnitude of @xmath46 .",
    "another possible solution to eq .   emerges when the @xmath1 and @xmath3 pulses have the same time dependence , say @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , while the @xmath2 pulse could differ , @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 and condition becomes @xmath52 .",
    "this condition can be satisfied in several ways , cf .",
    "a simple realization for that condition occurs with the choice [ breaking conditions b]_2 & = & _ 3 , [ breaking condition 1b ] + _ p&=&-_s , [ breaking condition 2b ] + _ c & = & _ p . [ breaking condition 3b ] then @xmath53 and the spectator state reads [ dark state in case of no adiabatic coupling ] = ( e^-i_s - ) .",
    "the dynamics of the two coupled householder states @xmath26 and @xmath37 , coupled by the interaction @xmath54 , offer other interesting possibilities .",
    "for the two - state system @xmath55 , analytic solutions may be possible ; these are known for many examples of pulse and detuning time dependences .",
    "hence , by writing down the propagator in the householder basis for a known two - state analytical solution , and by using the transformation back to the original basis by the householder reflection @xmath56 , one can write down a number of analytic solutions for the three - state loop system",
    ". these would generalize the similar analytical solutions for a @xmath57 system @xcite .",
    "if only state @xmath26 is initially populated then the dynamics remains confined within the effective two - state system @xmath55 .",
    "in this two - state system we can enforce complete population return to state @xmath26 , complete population inversion to state @xmath37 or create a superposition of states @xmath26 and @xmath37 .    _ complete population transfer _ from state @xmath26 to the householder state @xmath37 can be produced by a resonant @xmath58-pulse @xcite , by adiabatic level - crossing adiabatic passage @xcite , or by a variety of novel more sophisticated techniques @xcite .",
    "viewed in the original basis , the system ends up in a superposition of @xmath30 and @xmath44 , + e^-i_p , with the angle @xmath29 given by ( [ theta ] ) ; thus the superposition is fully controlled by the ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and has a relative phase @xmath61 .    a predetermined superposition of states @xmath26 and @xmath37 can be created by resonant fractional-@xmath58 pulses , or by modifications of adiabatic - passage techniques , for example , half - scrap @xcite and two - state stirap @xcite .",
    "such techniques allow , for instance , the creation of an arbitrary predetermined maximally coherent superposition of the three states @xmath26 , @xmath30 , and @xmath44 .",
    "for example , one can create a maximally coherent superposition using fractional-@xmath62 pulses that obey conditions ( [ breaking conditions b ] ) and which are resonant in the householder basis ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "such an example is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ superposition1 ] .",
    "let us assume now that it is state @xmath30 that is populated initially .",
    "( the symmetric case of state @xmath44 initially populated is just a matter of relabelling the states . )",
    "if the @xmath3 pulse precedes the @xmath1 pulse , then we are in the dark state ( [ dark state ] ) and this is a situation similar to stirap , then there will occur complete population transfer to state @xmath44",
    ". the resonant case of this process was discussed and explained earlier @xcite . if we are in state @xmath30 and we apply the pulse in the intuitive order ( the @xmath1 pulse precedes the @xmath3 pulse ) , then we are in the bright state and depending on the pulses we can have complete population transfer to state @xmath26 , or end up in a superposition of states @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath44 . for example , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ superposition2 ] , one can use fractional-@xmath58 pulses to create an equal superposition of states @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath44 .",
    "we assume now that the @xmath1 and @xmath3 pulses have the same time dependence and consider a resonance condition between states @xmath26 and @xmath38 , [ resonance condition ] _ 3 = 0 .",
    "the resulting householder hamiltonian is exactly that of the lambda linkage on two - photon resonance used for stirap @xcite .",
    "the traditional dark state of the stirap process appears here as _ d & = & - + & = & -e^i_p + , [ dark state ] where @xmath64 .",
    "the state @xmath65 is a spectator ( or population - trapping ) state because it is not affected by the specified radiation , but it has components of all three of the original basis states .",
    "one can use this new kind of spectator state , with the traditional stirap pulse sequence of @xmath66 preceding @xmath67 , to move the initial population from state @xmath26 to a superposition of state @xmath68 and state @xmath69 .",
    "the superposition is controlled by the ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and has the phase @xmath15 .",
    "condition can always be satisfied for an appropriate choice of the ( time - dependent ) detuning @xmath70 [ or @xmath71 .",
    "however , the specific time dependence , although possible in principle , might be complicated and difficult to produce experimentally . condition can be satisfied with constant detunings when the @xmath1 and @xmath3 pulses share the same time dependence : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then the mixing angle @xmath29 is constant [ see eq .  ] and @xmath74 .",
    "two options provide the needed pulses :    \\(i ) the conditions [ 2pr conditions]&&_p+_s = /2 , [ phase condition ] + & & _ 3 = -_2[detuning condition ] hold",
    ". then the @xmath2 field can be arbitrary and both detunings @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be constant .",
    "\\(ii ) the @xmath2 field is constant .",
    "then condition can be fulfilled for constant detunings that obey the relation [ detuning condition 2 ] _ 3 = -_2",
    "+ _ s ( _ p+_s ) .",
    "therefore , the usual two - photon resonance condition , necessary for the emergence of a spectator ( dark ) state in the original basis , is replaced by a condition for the two - photon detuning @xmath76 : either ( i ) eq .  , for arbitrary @xmath2 field but with the phase relation , or ( ii ) eq .",
    ", for constant @xmath2 field .    if we now start initially in state @xmath26 and apply the @xmath2 pulse before the @xmath1 pulse , then the following superposition is formed -ie^-i_s + .",
    "the superposition characteristics are fixed by the @xmath2-field phase and the angle @xmath29 defined by eq .  .",
    "figure [ superposition3 ] illustrates how , starting in state @xmath26 and applying the @xmath2 pulse before the @xmath1 pulse we obtain an equal superposition of @xmath30 and @xmath44 .",
    "the householder transformation introduced here for a three - state loop system is readily extended to a general @xmath0-state quantum system with arbitrary linkages , even in the most general case when each state connects to any other state . a suitable sequence of at most @xmath77 householder transformations can cast the hamiltonian , which is a hermitian matrix , into a _",
    "tridiagonal _ form . in this sequence",
    "the householder vector for the @xmath78th reflection is chosen as    defines the @xmath79-st axis , i.e. its components are zero except a unity at the @xmath79st place , here @xmath80 is the @xmath78th column vector of the transformed hamiltonian after the @xmath78th step .",
    "the tridiagonalization of the hamiltonian implies that in the householder basis , each of the new basis states is connected only to its nearest neighbor states , thus forming a _ chainwise _ linkage pattern .",
    "the chain is conceptually simpler , and analytically easier , to treat , with a variety of exact and approximate approaches available in the literature .",
    "a two - parameter householder reflection can break the loop - linkage pattern of a three - state system , providing instead a simple chain . for the three - state system",
    "the result can appear either as a lambda system ( with initial population at one end of the chain ) or as a vee system ( with initial population in the middle state of the chain ) . in either case",
    "the system can be transformed further into a pair of coupled states and a spectator state , within which population remains trapped .",
    "this is a new kind of spectator state involving all three basis states ; it contrasts with the conventional dark states that have no excited - state component .",
    "these results hold intrinsic interest because the three - state loop is the simplest discrete - state quantum system in which nontrivial interference occurs .",
    "the present solutions may therefore offer opportunities for manipulating the quantum states of such systems .",
    "our objective in this paper has been to introduce this important novel transformation , and with it to show that a loop system is equivalent to a chain system .",
    "the presented examples of the uses of the householder transformation in a three - state loop system , being by no means exhaustive , have demonstrated a number of potential applications based on analytical approaches , ranging from hidden chain breaking and spectator states to hidden two - photon resonances and analytic solutions .",
    "these allow one to establish generic features of the interaction dynamics and engineer interactions that can produce various superposition states at will .",
    "the results in this work for three - state systems are readily extended to @xmath0-state systems .",
    "more general sequences of householder reflections can replace there arbitrary complicated linkages with simple chain linkages .",
    "hence an @xmath0-state system wherein each state is coupled to any other state can be reduced to an equivalent chain system with nearest - neighbor interactions only",
    ". then one can apply various available analytical approaches to the householder chain to reveal interesting novel features of the multistate dynamics , including hilbert space factorization , hidden spectator states and ensuing dynamical invariants .",
