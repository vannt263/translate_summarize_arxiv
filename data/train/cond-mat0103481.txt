    "<S> recently , furusaki reported a theoretical study of the resonant tunneling through a quantum dot ( qd ) weakly coupled to two ll leads ( hereafter as ll - qd - ll).@xcite assuming that the tunneling is an incoherent sequential tunneling , the author derived the linear conductance using the master equation approach . </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian of the system can be split into three parts : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the left and right ll leads in its standard form ( see @xcite ) , @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the qd , with @xmath3 the creation / annihilation operators of the n - th energy level in the dot ( for simplicity , the intradot coulomb interaction has been neglected ) . </S>",

    "<S> fig.1 shows  the current vs bias voltage at a fixed value @xmath47 for different interaction parameters of the ll leads , @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> a current plateau appears again for @xmath55 around @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) somehow , the curves with @xmath56 intersect approximately at a point ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , which may indicate the peculiar behavior for strong interacting case .    </S>",

    "<S> the dependence of the peak current on @xmath34 and @xmath64 can be obtained by estimating the current @xmath65 at @xmath63 . because the asymptotic limit of the gamma function is @xmath38 @xmath66 @xmath67,@xcite one finds that at low temperatures @xmath68 the current behaves as @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 , whereas at high temperatures @xmath72 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath73 . </S>",
