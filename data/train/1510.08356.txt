    "the effects of raman and rayleigh scattering processes are observable when the radiation from / around the wd passes through the neutral part of the giant wind . in these processes",

    "raman scattering as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics was outlined by @xcite .",
    "the most famous example of raman - scattered lines in the spectrum of symbiotic stars is represented by broad emission features at 6825 and 7082  that are formed when the photons of ovi  1032 and 1038  emission lines are scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms in the wind from the giant @xcite .    also",
    ", transitions between the levels of even principal quantum numbers in the heii  atom produce photons that can be easily scattered onto neutral hydrogen atoms because their wavelengths are near to the hi  lyman transitions , where the scattering cross - section is relatively large ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , the raman emission at 6545 , produced by heii1025  scattering , was observed in some planetary nebulae and symbiotic stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "a1340302000 ] we can still compare the @xmath1826545 line profile with other heii  lines because they are formed in the same he@xmath183 region around the wd and thus are similar in the profile .    we determined the fwhm of the raman feature to 14.5 and 15.2  ( table  1 ) , which , according to equation  ( [ eq : dl ] ) , converts to the velocity widths @xmath184104 and @xmath12109kms@xmath82 .",
    "for heii6560 , @xmath185 and @xmath186kms@xmath82  in 2006 and 2007 .",
    "the velocity width of the heii6527  line is @xmath187kms@xmath82  in both spectra . hence , @xmath188 of the raman emission is larger by @xmath189kms@xmath82 . assuming a single - peaked profile of the original heii1025  line , this additional broadening can be attributed to the doppler effect produced by the motion of the scattering h@xmath190-atoms relative to the he@xmath183 region .",
    "basically , the neutral part of the wind between the two stars moves toward the he@xmath183 region and thus produces blue shifted raman photons , while the outer wind region moves away from it , producing raman photons in the red line wing @xcite .",
    "this result suggests a dispersion velocity of the giant s wind to be of @xmath189kms@xmath82 , which can be interpreted as double that of @xmath97 because it is consistent with a typical terminal velocity of the wind from mira variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , future repeated observations that are also made for other symbiotic miras and for other raman - scattered heii  lines should allow us to obtain more accurate results .",
    "in symbiotic binaries the heii  emission is located predominately near the hot component .",
    "a part of its line photons can be converted by atomic hydrogen in the neutral part of the giant s wind into raman photons . within the stb model ( section  3.3.1 )",
    "the neutral region has a conical shape , whose opening angle is given by the flux of hydrogen - ionizing photons and the mass - loss rate from the giant .",
    "therefore , by knowing the fundamental parameters of the hot component , the mass - loss rate can be probed via raman scattering .",
    "the key parameter is the efficiency @xmath50 of this process , because it is a function of the opening angle of the neutral zone .",
    "the method is described in section  3.3 .    in this paper",
    "we investigated raman heii@xmath0 conversion in the spectrum of d - type symbiotic star v1016  cyg . to isolate the raman 6545  emission and to derive @xmath50 of the corresponding heii1025  scattering , we proceeded in a way that was similar @xcite . in our spectra from 2006 april and 2007 july , we derived @xmath10.102 and 0.148 . using our method , we determined the corresponding @xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the parameters are summarized in table  2 .",
    "our quantities of @xmath5 are well comparable with those obtained by other methods ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "deriving @xmath5 by using heii1025  scattering has two main advantages : ( i ) a large @xmath191 ( i.e. , a low raman - limiting hi  column density ) allows us to simplify the method by setting @xmath153 for sufficiently massive winds ( section  [ sect : domega ] , figure  [ fig : nhth ] ) ; and ( ii ) the efficiency of heii1025  scattering can be derived just from the optical spectrum ( section  [ sect : eff ] ) .",
    "the relative simplicity and accuracy of our method can be used to test , for example , a possible dependence of @xmath5 on the pulsation phase in symbiotic miras .",
    "an extension of the method to other mira  wd binary systems may probe theoretical predictions of @xmath5 at different stages of agb evolution .    we thank the anonymous referee for useful comments and theodor pribulla for the acquisition of the optical spectra that we used in this contribution .",
