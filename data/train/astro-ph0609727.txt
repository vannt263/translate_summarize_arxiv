    "ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are two of the most intriguing galactic globular clusters ( gc s ) .",
    "the integrated - light study by @xcite revealed a strong far - uv flux for these metal - rich ( @xmath0 } \\simeq -0.60 $ ] and @xmath1 , respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) bulge gc s .",
    "the far - uv flux in resolved gc s is dominated by hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially when rare uv - bright post - asymptotic giant branch stars are not present .",
    "accordingly , the most likely explanation for the far - uv flux in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 was immediately recognized to be hot hb stars . however , while the uv - upturn phenomenon in elliptical galaxies is often attributed to blue hb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no resolved metal - rich gc had been known with a blue hb morphology .",
    "the tendency for metal - rich gc s to have red hb s while metal - poor gc s have predominantly blue hb s reflects the `` first parameter '' of hb morphology . as a consequence , the presence of blue hb stars in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 would represent an example of the so - called `` second - parameter ( 2@xmath2p ) phenomenon . ''",
    "the presence of blue hb stars extending almost as faint in @xmath3 as the turnoff ( to ) point in both ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 was confirmed by @xcite , who presented _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) photometry for both these gc s from the survey by @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the published diagrams is the presence of a _ strongly sloped _",
    "hb at colors where other gc s have a much more nearly `` horizontal '' hb . as emphasized by (",
    "* , hereafter sc98 ) , such a sloped hb can not be simply the result of an older age or of enhanced mass loss along the red giant branch ( rgb ) : while these are able to move a star horizontally along the hb , neither is able to increase the luminosity of a blue hb star compared to the red hb or rr lyrae stars .",
    "likewise , while strong differential reddening might explain the sloping hb of a red hb cluster , it obviously can not produce rr lyrae and blue hb stars .",
    "sc98 conclude therefore that _ non - canonical _ 2@xmath2p candidates must be at play in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "however , these conclusions were challenged by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , hereafter r02 ) , who computed models with non - standard values of the chemical abundance and mixing length parameter . some of their models did reveal sloped hb s , but only as a consequence of an anomalously _ faint red hb _ ( in @xmath3 ) , together with a blue hb having a @xmath3-band luminosity consistent with the canonical models ( see , e.g. , their fig .  2 ) .",
    "additional insights are provided by stellar variability and spectroscopic studies .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that the rr lyrae variable stars in these gc s , which occupy the normally `` horizontal '' part of the hb , have much longer periods than field rr lyrae of similar metallicity , thus strongly suggesting that they are intrinsically more luminous ( sc98 ) . moreover , theoretical calculations by @xcite have shown that , contrary to the suggestions by @xcite , the rr lyrae components in both clusters can not be explained in terms of evolution away from a position on the blue hb  and neither can the sloping nature of the hb be reproduced in this way . on the other hand , the first spectroscopic measurements of the gravities of blue hb stars in both ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 @xcite revealed surface gravities that are higher than predicted by even the canonical models , thus arguing against an anomalously bright blue hb  +  rr lyrae component in these clusters .",
    "however , a recent reassessment of the spectroscopic gravities of blue hb stars in ngc  6388 by @xcite indicates that the actual gravities should , in fact , be lower than the canonical values .",
    "it appears that the 1999 values must have been in error by a substantial amount , probably due to unresolved blends in the crowded inner regions of these massive ( @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gc s .    in an effort to shed light on this puzzling situation ,",

    "the ngc  6388 data used in this paper were obtained under _ hst _ program snap-9821 ( pi b. j. pritzl ) , which used the wide - field channel of the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) to obtain six @xmath6 ( f435w ) , @xmath3 ( f555w ) , @xmath7 ( f814w ) exposure triptychs on separate dates ranging from 2003 october to 2004 june .",
    "in addition , we have retrieved data from the _ hst _ archives , as obtained under go-9835 ( pi g. drukier ) . these consist of 12 @xmath3 and 17 @xmath7 exposures obtained with the high - resolution channel of acs on 2003 october 30 .",

    "although these data are not included in the plots in this paper , they were used to establish a network of photometric standards in the cluster field which could be used to establish accurate photometric zero - points for the acs images .",
    "color transformations for the acs data were based on these local standards and similar acs - ground - based comparisons for 47  tuc , ngc  2419 , ngc  6341 ( m92 ) , and ngc  6752 .",

    ", we note that the acs filter bandpasses are not identical to the standard @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 bandpasses of @xcite  but then again , even among the various ground - based observing runs where the clusters were observed , the filters and detectors are not identical : bandpass mismatch is an unavoidable complication in filter photometry when one does not have a privately owned photometer . even _ with _ a private photometer , bandpasses can drift with atmospheric conditions , or as filters , detectors , and mirror coatings age .",
    "we have removed the effects of mismatch to second order by including linear and quadratic color terms , both in the transformation equations that relate our ground - based observations to landolt s photometric system _ and _ in the equations that relate the acs magnitudes to our ground - based system .",
    "extensive experience suggests that the residual effects of bandpass mismatch in these filters reach an irreducible minimum scatter of 0.01  0.02 mag on a star - by - star basis , and considerably less than this on an ensemble average of many stars .    , but using the reddening - independent quantity @xmath9 instead of @xmath3 , enforcing a match of the to colors of the two clusters , and zooming in around the to / sgb level .",

    "we have applied shifts of + 3.2 in @xmath3 and + 0.85 in  to the 47  tuc data , in order to register its red hb to ngc  6388 s .",
    "the magnitude and color of the to in each cluster were determined by an iterative robust numerical fit of a parabola to the data in a magnitude range @xmath11mag of the to ; we obtained ( @xmath3 ,  ) @xmath12 for ngc  6388 , and ( 17.70 , 1.27 ) for 47  tuc .",
    "note that we obtained clean , sharp , well - populated sequences in the cmd by plotting only the stars with the best photometry .",
    "our selection criteria will be described in stetson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the to points and sgb s of 47  tuc and ngc  6388 coincide in brightness rather well once their red hb s are registered .",
    "this suggests that any age difference between the two clusters is at the level of @xmath13  gyr , assuming that their red hb s have the same absolute luminosity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite computed isochrones for different values of [ fe / h ] , @xmath14 $ ] , helium abundance @xmath15 , the mixing length parameter @xmath16 , and rotation rates @xmath17 .",
    "as is already well known , the difference in color between the base of the rgb and the main - sequence to is a good relative age indicator , due to its small dependence on [ fe / h ] , @xmath14 $ ] , and @xmath17 . on the other hand , these calculations also show that this color difference , as well as the detailed shape of the sgb , do present some dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    to perform a more meaningful differential comparison that minimizes the effects of differential reddening in ngc  6388 , we have replaced @xmath3 with the reddening - independent quantity @xmath18 , and then registered the to points of the two clusters in color .",
    "although numerical fitting of parabolas to @xmath9 as a function of @xmath5 at the to s of the two gc s suggests that their bluest colors differ by 0.77  mag , we still performed a sanity check by directly overplotting the two cmds with a range of horizontal shifts , and concluded that @xmath19 ( @xmath20 error bar ) appeared best to the eye ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qmd ] ) .",
    "we should note that the detection limit in these data is near @xmath21 , and that past experience ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads us to expect that the observed colors may be biased too blue by @xmath220.1@xmath8mag as this limit is approached .",
    "accordingly , we have been careful to restrict our comparisons to the immediate vicinity of the to itself , @xmath23 , where any systematic bias is expected to be much smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig : qmd ] shows that , when the to points of the clusters are registered , the difference in color @xmath24 between the base of the rgb and the to is very similar for both clusters .",
    "this quantity is only slightly larger for ngc  6388 than for 47  tuc , at a level @xmath25  mag ( @xmath20 error bar ) .",
    "if interpreted in terms of an age difference , this translates into @xmath26  gyr ( ngc  6388 being younger ) . assuming that the clusters have similar ages , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath14 $ ] , which appears most consistent with the to / red hb ( `` vertical method '' ) and the rgb data ( see also the next subsection )",
    ", one also finds @xmath27 ( in the sense that ngc  6388 should have a _ lower _",
    "@xmath15 ) , or @xmath28 ( again in the sense that ngc  6388 should have a lower @xmath16 ) .",
    "such a difference in @xmath15 between the two gc s would be the opposite of that needed to explain the ngc  6388 hb morphology .",
    "stronger constraints on @xmath15 and @xmath16 variations between the two clusters are derived from their rgb properties ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the rgb s of 47  tuc and ngc  6388 have very similar morphologies , according to figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the larger scatter in the ngc  6388 cmd than in 47  tuc s might be due in part to photometric errors and in part to differential reddening , thus making it difficult to determine if the stars scattered toward the red of the main rgb in ngc  6388 represent a minor metal - rich component .",
    "a sizeable metal - poor component is clearly not present ( see also r02 ) .",
    "a small deviation of the bulk of the brighter ngc  6388 rgb stars towards redder colors compared with the 47  tuc cmd , if real , would suggest that ngc  6388 might be slightly more metal - rich ( i.e. , by @xmath29  dex ) than 47  tuc ( @xmath0 } = -0.76 $ ]  dex ; * ? ? ?",
    "when their red hb s are registered , one also finds that their to colors become somewhat offset ( with ngc  6388 s being bluer ) and that their rgb s actually cross just above the hb level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "theoretical isochrones show that these effects are to be expected if ngc  6388 is more metal - rich than 47  tuc at the level indicated above .",
    "the `` bump '' in the rgb luminosity function lies at a @xmath30 in ngc  6388 , and 14.50 in 47  tuc .",
    "thus , the to - to - bump @xmath3-magnitude differences are 3.26 and 3.20 , respectively .",
    "if real , this difference would suggest that ngc  6388 is more metal-_poor _",
    "( by @xmath31  dex ) than 47  tuc . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of @xmath32 measured by @xcite differ by only 0.03  mag between 47  tuc and ngc  6388 ; this could be produced by a very small metallicity difference , by a @xmath33 ( ngc  6388 being more helium - rich ; see fig .",
    "5 in r02 ) , and/or by a small difference in age of @xmath34  gyr ( ngc  6388 being younger ) .",
    "note , finally , that near - infrared photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 have , if anything , slightly _ bluer _ rgb s than 47  tuc , contrary to what would be expected in the r02 scenario .",
    "indeed , @xcite find a normal value of @xmath35 for both ngc  6441 and 47  tuc ( ngc  6388 is not in their studied sample ) .",
    "the lack of a large difference in @xmath16 and [ fe / h ] between the two gc s , while not unexpected , already rules out the r02 scenario , in which a combination of high metallicity and low @xmath16 is invoked , leading to an underluminous red hb as mentioned in  1 .    , but using @xmath9 instead of @xmath3 and focusing around the red hb region . , width=326 ]    [ fig : cmd2 ]      an overluminous red hb , as would be implied by a high primordial @xmath15 ( sc98 ) , is ruled out if , as appears likely , the two clusters have similar ages and metallicities .",
    "the hb luminosity function is also known to be affected by the stars evolutionary parameters ; in particular , a higher @xmath15 in ngc  6388 should produce more luminosity evolution away from the zero - age hb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is clearly not present in the observed cmd .",
    "likewise , the fact that there is no significant component fainter than the bulk of the ngc  6388 red hb stars suggests that any metal - rich component in this cluster ( i.e. , with @xmath0 } \\gtrsim -0.5 $ ]  dex ) should be minor .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd2 ] shows a more detailed comparison of the cmds of ngc  6388 and 47  tuc around the red hb region , again using the reddening - independent quantity @xmath9 .",
    "the 47  tuc @xmath9 values were shifted by @xmath36  mag .",
    "adding random scatter at a level of @xmath37  mag to the 47  tuc cmd allows one to reproduce the overall appearance of the rgb and the red hb quite well , thus implying a @xmath38 ( in the sense of ngc  6388 having a higher @xmath15 ) based on the luminosity width of the hb .",
    "the main difference between the two hb s is the tendency for the bluer of the ngc  6388 red hb stars to be slightly brighter than the average line that defines the 47  tuc red hb .",
    "this , along with the fact that the to points and sgb s of the two gc s match well in brightness when the two red hb s are registered , strongly suggests that both the rr lyrae and blue hb components ( and , to a lesser extent , also the bluer red hb stars ) of ngc  6388 are indeed intrinsically overluminous with respect to the 47  tuc red hb .",
    "well - populated agb `` clumps '' are seen in both the 47  tuc and ngc  6388 cmd s .",
    "@xcite have shown that , the bluer the hb morphology of a gc , the less pronounced the resulting agb clump . therefore , the majority of the stars in this phase originate from red hb stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference in @xmath3 magnitude between the agb clump and the red hb is basically indistinguishable between ngc  6388 and 47  tuc .",
    "unfortunately , this does not provide us with strong constraints on the difference in @xmath15 or metallicity between the two gc s , since the difference in magnitude between the agb clump and the red hb is not very sensitive to these evolutionary parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the present _ letter _ , we have shown that , apart from the blue hb and rr lyrae components , the cmd s of ngc  6388 and 47  tuc are very similar , thus strongly suggesting that the bulk of the stars in these two clusters are very similar .",
    "differences in age , metallicity , @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 between the two gc s , if present , should be small .",
    "our results suggest that the red hb component of ngc  6388 is neither underluminous ( as in the `` canonical tilt '' scenario of r02 ) nor overluminous ( as in the high-@xmath15 scenario of sc98 ) , except for its bluest stars . on the other hand , both the rr lyrae and blue hb stars in ngc  6388 _ are _ significantly overluminous compared to field rr lyrae stars of similar [ fe / h ] , thus explaining ngc  6388 s anomalously long rr lyrae periods .",
    "the lack of a sizeable luminosity difference between the red hb s of ngc  6388 and 47  tuc indicates that _ the 2@xmath39p that leads to the production of an overluminous rr lyrae  +  blue hb component in ngc  6388 must be non - canonical in nature_that is , it must be neither age nor rgb mass loss , or else a sloped hb would not result ( sc98 ) .",
    "however , since only a relatively small fraction ( @xmath40 ; @xcite @xcite ) of the hb stars are in the rr lyrae strip or on the blue hb , only a minor fraction of the cluster stars should be affected by this non - canonical 2@xmath2p , which could be either @xmath15 or / and the helium - core mass at the he - flash .",
    "( a fraction of the red hb stars , especially the bluer 25% or so , could also be affected , though to a much smaller extent . )",
    "additional , detailed studies of the blue hb , rr lyrae , and main sequence components will be required before we are in a position to conclusively decide what 2@xmath2p(s ) is ( are ) responsible ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
