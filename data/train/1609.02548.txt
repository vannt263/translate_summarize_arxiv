    "the possible centralizers of an element of a raag have been classified by servatius @xcite , and the characterization there would seem to suggest that equality does not hold in general .",
    "of course , this is impossible to check in the absence of a method to compute nested complesity length , and question [ ncl algorithm ] arises naturally .",
    "our next corollary concerns the model theoretic behavior of @xmath7 .",
    "we focus on _ stability _ , one of the most important and well - developed notions in modern model theory .",
    "given a first - order structure , stability of its theory implies an abstract notion of independence and dimension for definable sets in that structure ( see pillay @xcite for details ) .",
    "stability can also be treated as a combinatorial property obtained from half - graphs .",
    "given an integer @xmath45 , a graph @xmath14 is _",
    "@xmath46-edge stable _ if it does not contain any half - graph of height @xmath47 as an induced subgraph . we can thus rephrase corollary [ omits half - graphs ] .",
    "@xmath7 is @xmath46-edge stable for @xmath48 .",
    "when considering the first - order theory of @xmath7 in the language of graphs , this corollary implies that the edge formula ( and thus any quantifier - free formula ) is stable in the model theoretic sense ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.2.3 ) .",
    "whether arbitrary formulas are stable remains an intriguing open question , and would likely require some understanding of quantifier elimination for the theory of @xmath7 in some suitable expansion of the graph language .",
    "this aspect of the nature of curve graphs remains unexplored , and stability is only one among a host of natural questions about their first - order theories to pursue .",
    "on the other hand , edge - stability of @xmath7 alone has strong consequences for the structure of large finite subgraphs of @xmath7 , via szemerdi s regularity lemma @xcite .",
    "in particular , malliaris and shelah show that if @xmath14 is a @xmath46-edge - stable graph , then the regularity lemma can be strengthened so that in szemerdi partitions of large induced subgraphs of @xmath14 , the bound on the number of pieces is significantly improved , there is no need for irregular pairs , and the density between each pair of pieces is within @xmath49 of @xmath35 or @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "thus a consequence of our work is that the class of graphs with @xmath3 enjoys this stronger form of szemerdi regularity .",
    "next we consider an explicit family of multipartite graphs .",
    "[ multipartite def ] given integers @xmath51 , let @xmath52 denote the complete @xmath53-partite graph in which each piece of the partition has size @xmath54 .",

    "combined with the erds - stone theorem , this implies a general relationship ( proposition [ density ncl prop ] ) between nested complexity length and the _ upper density _",
