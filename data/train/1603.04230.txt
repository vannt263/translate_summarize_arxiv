    "fault - tolerant quantum computing involves a host of resource overheads , entering at different stages of the process .",
    "the most widely known cost is that of encoding a logical qubit into many physical qubits , which provides safe storage of quantum information .",
    "however , once encoded , a logical qubit only natively supports a limited set of fault - tolerant operations  @xcite . for high - threshold codes ,",
    "the native operations belong within the clifford group .",
    "additional layers of gadgets are required to enable general purpose quantum computation .",
    "a corollary of the solovay - kitaev theorem  @xcite is that if the clifford group is augmented by a non - clifford @xmath0 gate , also called the @xmath1 gate , the device can efficiently approximate any required quantum algorithm .",
    "these @xmath0 gates can in turn be fault - tolerantly performed by using state injection of high - fidelity magic states , prepared by distillation  @xcite .",
    "however , the solovay - kitaev theorem requires a huge number of @xmath0 gates , and early magic state distillation protocols put a high price on each one .",
    "the last decade has seen substantial advances in both these areas .",
    "magic state distillation is now possible at better rates  @xcite , reducing the expected cost per high quality @xmath0-gate . the number of @xmath0-gates needed to approximate some unitary , the so - called @xmath0-count , has also been significantly reduced after the discovery of new gate synthesis techniques  @xcite .     to perform a non - clifford gate @xmath2 . if the @xmath3-basis measurement outcome is  + 1 \" , then a correction @xmath4 is needed . ]",
    "nevertheless , fault - tolerant quantum computing remains a monumental challenge , so further resources savings are essential .",
    "one suggested route is to circumvent magic states altogether , for instance by using gauge - fixing  @xcite of subsystem codes like the 3d colour code  @xcite .",
    "however , this route still pays a price for gate - synthesis and the additional qubit cost of 3d codes leads to a cubic scaling of overheads that is also achievable using magic states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , all current indications are that colour codes have a much lower error correction threshold  @xcite than the toric code  @xcite . for now , such low - noise levels appear beyond technological reach , ruling out gauge - fixing in the near - term .",
    "alternatively , one could work with qudits , @xmath5-level systems , which are favourable in terms of the cost of magic state distillation  @xcite , though in the qudit context little is known about gate synthesis or experimental feasibility .",
    "landahl and cesare  @xcite were the first to suggest that the gate synthesis overhead could be reduced by distilling different species of magic states , which provide smaller angle rotations instead of @xmath0-gates .",
    "specifically , they considered @xmath6 gates for integer @xmath7 , where @xmath8 gives the @xmath0-gate .",
    "these gates are part of an important family called the clifford hierarchy  @xcite , with @xmath6 residing in the @xmath9 level of the hierarchy and naturally appearing in quantum simulation  @xcite and the quantum fourier transform .",
    "landahl and cesare found that for small integer @xmath7 , distillation was favourable over gate synthesis methods known at the time .",
    "for very small angle rotations @xmath10 , they saw this advantage vanish .",
    "progress in gate synthesis has significantly eroded the importance of the landahl and cesare result , though their general idea endures .",
    "several researchers found efficient protocols that distill toffoli magic states  @xcite .",
    "duclos - cianci and poulin  @xcite modified a protocol proposed by meier , eastin and knill  @xcite to prepare magic states that again provide small angle rotations .",
    "this recent result was a substantial leap forward in the art of distilling magic states for small angle rotations , making magic state distillation cheaper than gate synthesis in many instances .",
    "we revisit the work of duclos - cianci and poulin , and find their protocol can be further refined .",
    "our proposed alternative requires fewer resources per attempt , and achieves superior error suppression with a higher success probability . both our protocol and that of duclos - cianci and poulin build on the earlier work of meier , eastin , and knill ( mek )  @xcite .    for very small angle rotations ,",
    "the required magic states become close to stabiliser states .",
    "duclos - cianci and poulin observed that in this regime some magic states in the protocol can be supplanted by stabiliser states , reducing resource costs in a certain regime .",
    "instead , we introduce the notion of magic state dilution , which takes magic states for @xmath7 level rotations , and converts them into a larger number of magic states for a finer rotations with higher @xmath7 .",
    "error rates are adjusted in the dilution process , and we find it works best at high @xmath7 . remarkably , dilution can even reduce noise when used at sufficiently high @xmath7 .",
    "first we review the clifford hierarchy and the magic state model .",
    "the well known pauli group @xmath11 is the group composed of tensor products of the single qubit pauli operators .",
    "unitaries mapping the pauli group to itself are called clifford unitaries , which again form a group @xmath12 .",
    "clifford operations are physical operations composable from clifford unitaries , measurement of pauli operators and preparation of their eigenstates ( the stabiliser states ) , and classical feedforward .",
    "the magic state model of quantum computation  @xcite assumes clifford operations are free resources that can be implemented perfectly , and proceeds to evaluate the cost of non - clifford operations .",
    "such a model is suitable for logical qubits where the clifford operations are fault - tolerantly protected , as is common . in our conclusions",
    ", we discuss further the validity of counting only non - clifford resources .",
    "unitaries outside the clifford group can fall into other levels of the clifford hierarchy , defined recursively as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "it follows that the clifford group is the second level , and all higher levels include non - clifford gates .",
    "we will soon see the clifford hierarchy plays an important operational role in a teleportation process known as state injection  @xcite .",
    "we introduced small angle rotations in the @xmath15 basis , but here it is more convenient to work in the @xmath3 basis .",
    "we define unitaries @xmath16 with @xmath17 . the @xmath18 and @xmath19 gates are clifford , which are presumed ideal and an inexpensive resource .",
    "the @xmath20 gate is non - clifford and equivalent to the @xmath0 gate . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the gates are non - clifford and belong to the @xmath22 level of the clifford hierarchy . also important here are certain hermitian operators in the clifford hierarchy , and we define @xmath23 and find @xmath24 .",
    "we remark that @xmath25 equals the hadamard .",
    "preparation of non - stabiliser states is also a non - clifford operation , and these magic states also fall into a natural hierarchy .",
    "recall that stabiliser states are eigenstates of pauli operators , which are elements of @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the computational basis sates @xmath27 and @xmath28 are stabilised by the @xmath15 and @xmath29 pauli operators , respectively .",
    "below we will also make use of the stabiliser states @xmath30 , which satisfy @xmath31 for pauli @xmath32 .",
    "we consider magic states that are eigenstates of the @xmath33 operators , so that @xmath34 which we refer to as @xmath22 level magic state states .",
    "such resources can be used to inject @xmath2 rotations into circuits as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_inject ] ) .",
    "the injection procedure is probabilistic , and with probability @xmath35 it performs @xmath2 and with probability @xmath35 it performs @xmath36 . in the latter case a correction of @xmath37 is needed to get the desired result . since @xmath19 is clifford , the injection process is ensured to terminate within @xmath38 attempts .",
    "therefore , one can accomplish small angle rotations with a cost that depends on the cost of distilling high - fidelity @xmath39 states .",
    "in contrast , gate synthesis methods prescribe distilling just @xmath40 states and finding a gate sequence @xmath41 in terms of @xmath0 gates and cliffords @xmath42 .",
    "although , @xmath39 states will prove more expensive than @xmath40 , gate synthesis can require very many @xmath40 states , making it more expensive overall .",
    "there are many gate synthesis algorithms for finding gate sequences and here we consider the selinger and ross  @xcite algorithm ( sr ) and probabilistic quantum circuits with fallback ( pqf )  @xcite .",
    "sr has the benefit of a freely available software implementation and is provable optimal for unitary synthesis .",
    "pqf makes use of ancilla and measurements to achieved the best known performance , about a factor 3 more efficient than sr .",
    "several other methods ( see e.g.  @xcite ) exist , but all fall somewhere between sr and pqf in performance .",
    "we discuss the applicability of our results to rotations of arbitrarily angles in app .",
    "[ arb_angle ] .",
    "next we summarise the work of meier , eastin , and knill ( mek )  @xcite , upon which duclos - cianci and poulin built their construction .",
    "the mek protocol takes 10 input magic states and with some probability outputs 2 magic states .",
    "therefore , mek is said to be a @xmath43 protocol .",
    "accounting for the species of magic states , we call mek a @xmath44 protocol where the subscripts indicate that mek both inputs and outputs 3rd level magic states . we use dp@xmath45 to label the duclos - cianci and poulin protocol for distilling @xmath9 level magic states .",
    "each round of dp@xmath45 consumes a cocktail of different input magic states , and we describe it as a @xmath46 protocol .",
    "again , subscripts show what level magic state is used .",
    "we show the expected number of inputs required per attempt , which is sometimes a fraction .",
    "the fractional sequence terminates at the third level , because lower levels correspond to clifford resources and are considered free .",
    "the dp@xmath45 protocol is presented as a direct generalisation of mek , but one sees that in the case of @xmath8 the dp@xmath47 protocol is a @xmath48 protocol and so actually needs almost twice as many input states as mek . here",
    "we construct a streamlined variant of dp@xmath49 , that we call mek@xmath49 and is a @xmath50 protocol .",
    "we find that mek@xmath51 corresponds precisely to the original mek , so that mek@xmath49 is a more apt generalisation than dp@xmath45 .",
    "not only does mek@xmath49 require fewer input resources , it also achieves superior error suppression with a higher success probability .",
    "both mek and dp@xmath45 make use of a simple 4 qubit code .",
    "we use @xmath52 , short for encoder , to denote the clifford circuit that brings qubits into the codespace and acts on pairs of pauli operators as @xmath53 for pauli operators , we always use the subscript to denote which qubit the operator acts upon . preparing the first two qubits in the state @xmath27 and running the encoder will yield the code stabilised by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the logical state in the codespace is determined by the initial states of the last two qubits .",
    "having defined the codespace , we now turn to describing dp@xmath45 in more detail , where we will also discuss the important features of the 4-qubit code .",
    "the protocol dp@xmath45 is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]d ) . throughout , we label the top wire as the control qubit @xmath56 , and the subsequent qubits are labelled 1 to 4 .",
    "we summarise the main steps of the protocol here    1 .",
    "prepare qubits @xmath56 , 1 and 2 , in stabiliser states @xmath57 , @xmath27 and @xmath27 , respectively ; 2 .   prepare qubits 3 and 4 in noisy @xmath39 states with @xmath58 error ; 3 .",
    "perform the circuit gates shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]d ) : the @xmath20 gates are achieved by state injection using eight @xmath40 states , and @xmath4 is achieved with state injection resulting in overall @xmath59 error ; 4 .",
    "qubit @xmath56 is measured in @xmath32 basis , and we continue if the outcome is @xmath60 and otherwise declare failure ; 5 .",
    "qubits 1 and 2 are measured in @xmath15 basis , and we declare success if the outcome is @xmath60 and otherwise declare failure ; 6 .",
    "if successful , qubits 3 and 4 are output as @xmath39 states of higher fidelity .",
    "note that step 3 can include some additional postselected measurements highlighted in fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]d ) .",
    "if included these measurements detect some additional errors , but even without these measurements the protocol quadratically suppresses noise . for simplicity",
    "we will assume they are not performed .",
    "we next review some of the basic intuition behind why dp@xmath45 works , which is closely related to properties of the 4 qubit code used .",
    "the codespace provides both important transversality features and keeps the protocol protected against certain faults .",
    "regarding transversality , a global hadamard @xmath61 will preserve the code space , implementing a logical swap between the two encoded logical bits .",
    "more generally , one can verify that @xmath62 acts as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]a ) .",
    "we see that even without fixing the first two qubits to @xmath27 , this circuit implements a swap and a phase - swap ( a swap combined with a phase gate ) . furthermore , implementing controlled hadamards within the encoding will realise controlled versions of the swap and phase - swap .",
    "next , we note that for any hermitian unitary , such as @xmath33 , we have that conjugation by controlled - swaps will produce a controlled @xmath63 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]b ) .",
    "we combine this observation with the transversality properties of the code to get the identity of fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]c ) .",
    "an ancilla on the control of the controlled @xmath63 is used to measure the @xmath63 observable .",
    "if the desired magic state is an eigenstate of @xmath33 , then measuring @xmath63 allows us to detect a single error between two noisy @xmath39 states input on the bottom two circuit lines . in this sense ,",
    "the codespace has provided a swap gadget for distilling noisy @xmath39 magic states .",
    "although the controlled - hadamard rotations and @xmath33 rotation may be non - clifford , noisy magic states can be used to implement these operations . to see this recall that @xmath64 , and so a control - hadamard can be implemented by a control-@xmath32 gate sandwiched between @xmath20 and @xmath65 . in turn ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath65 can each be implemented at the cost of a single @xmath40 magic state .",
    "given noisy @xmath40 magic states , we implement noisy @xmath20 gates .",
    "this brings us to the second role played by the error - correction code .",
    "the @xmath20 gates are performed on qubits within an error correction code that can detect a single qubit error , and so we will detect a single error in any @xmath40 magic states . let us explain this point in more detail .",
    "when using state injection , if a magic state carries an error , then it will result in @xmath66 instead of @xmath20 , and so there is an additional @xmath3 acting on one of the four qubits .",
    "inside the encoding , the state is an eigenstate of @xmath67 , but a @xmath3 error will cause the state to become an eigenstate of @xmath68 . at the end of the circuit , we decode and",
    "measure , which is equivalent to measuring the @xmath67 observable .",
    "since we postselect on all @xmath69 outcomes , any error on a single @xmath40 will be detected .",
    "in contrast , the central @xmath4 rotation occurs outside the protection of the codespace when the logical qubits have been decoded onto single qubits .",
    "therefore , the protocol will not be robust against failure of this gate , and so this rotation must be high fidelity and we herein call it the pivotal rotation .",
    "nevertheless , we can construct good distillation protocols provided magic states used in the pivotal rotation have already been distilled to a much higher fidelity than all other elements of the circuit .",
    "these high fidelity resources will be costly , but the protocol remains efficient because resources for performing @xmath4 are less valuable than the @xmath39 states we are distilling .",
    "we are erecting a pyramid of distillation protocols , with resources from lower in the clifford hierarchy fuelling distillation at higher levels .",
    "our main contribution is to show that this circuit can be compressed into fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]e ) .",
    "this cancels several @xmath20 rotations to reduce the number of magic states consumed .",
    "the steps of the protocol roughly follows those numerically listed in the previous section , except step 3 now uses the circuit of fig .",
    "( [ fig_idents1]e ) , and we use only 8 magic states to inject the @xmath20 gates . it is important that the circuit retains its fault - tolerance properties through the compression process . that is , even when compressed the noisy @xmath20 gates still occur within the four - qubit error correction code , and so we still expect to detect the failure of any single @xmath20 gate . in app .",
    "[ app_noise ] , we present a full noise analysis that rigorously confirms this intuition .     here",
    "we show how to compress the distillation protocol , removing unnecessary non - clifford gates .",

    "going further , we notice that @xmath73 and so @xmath74 . using @xmath75 ,",
    "we conclude @xmath76 .",

    "( [ fig_idents1]e ) .",
    "this section introduces several definitions and notations used to describe the performance of protocols , and quantify their cost .",

    "unless otherwise stated , we assume diagonal noise so that @xmath85 is diagonal in the same basis as @xmath86 , and for such states one can show @xmath90 .",
    "the protocols considered here use a cocktail of input resources .",
    "we use @xmath58 and @xmath91 to denote the input error rates of the noisy @xmath39 and @xmath40 states used .",
    "let @xmath92 be any rotation of the form @xmath93 and @xmath94 be the associated ideal channel .",
    "we consider this channel with @xmath3 noise @xmath95 and say the channel has error rate @xmath96 .",
    "this can be easily to related to other noise metrics . if @xmath5 is a unitarily invariant distance measure on channels then @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the identity channel .",

    "the diamond norm distance of channels is closely related to the 1-norm distance on states .",
    "if a noisy magic state with @xmath87 error ( as measured by 1-norm distance ) is used to inject a rotation , then the resulting noisy rotation will have error not exceeding @xmath87 ( as measured by the diamond norm ) .",

    "this widening gap between gate synthesis and mek@xmath45 is seen for all @xmath7 and @xmath107 .",
    "this increase in gap is intuitive because the distillation cost drops with @xmath140 , but the @xmath0-count of gate synthesis is independent of @xmath140 .",

    "the highest known thresholds for error correction are @xmath141 for the toric code  @xcite and @xmath142 for knill s model of postselected quantum computation  @xcite . to prevent astronomical overheads",
    ", physical gates must be comfortably below the threshold , and so we assume all physical gates have infidelities well below @xmath143 . because preparing raw magic states will involve several physical gates , it has often been assumed that @xmath140 will be higher than the physical gate error rate , maybe even an order of magnitude higher .",
    "however , li  @xcite has shown that we can probabilistically prepare raw magic states at infidelities of about half the physical control-@xmath32 gate error , assuming control-@xmath32 failure is the dominant noise mechanism .",
    "we remind the reader that we assume logical level control-@xmath32 gates are ideal , but beneath the hood of error correction we have very noisy physical control-@xmath32 gates .",

    "however , for sufficiently small angles the associated magic states become very close to stabiliser states , and we should be able to exploit this to reduce resource costs . in the analysis of duclos - cianci and poulin , they replaced noisy @xmath39 states with a stabiliser state whenever @xmath7 exceeded 8 .",
    "this enabled resource costs to eventually drop with @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath57 state can be considered a noisy @xmath39 state , though with coherent ( non - diagonal ) noise .",
