    "a full understanding of the co - evolution of the stellar , gaseous and dark matter ( dm ) components of galaxies , and the physical causes thereof , is the primary goal of studies of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "observations directly yield a snapshot of the luminosities ( and stellar masses ) of the galaxy population at a given redshift , whereas numerical studies most easily predict the abundance and evolution of dm haloes .",
    "one way to connect these two is with the `` abundance matching '' ansatz : galaxies are assigned to dm haloes by rank - ordering each set and matching them one - to - one from highest to lowest . using this assumption",
    ", @xcite showed that galaxy formation is most efficient in haloes of mass @xmath10 , at which mass 25% of the baryons had been converted to stars .",
    "the method of @xcite was based on the summed luminosity of all galaxies in a halo , and was then extended to consider central galaxies and satellites @xcite .",
    "another approach is to populate haloes with galaxies ( the so - called `` halo occupation distribution '' , or hod ) in order to reproduce galaxy clustering @xcite . while these methods are powerful , they are model - dependent in the sense that some critical assumptions are made in the statistical link between galaxies and their haloes .    connecting the galaxies to their dark matter haloes in a more direct fashion",
    "requires probes of the gravitational effects of the dm haloes .",
    "there are several ways to measure galaxy masses at intermediate redshifts .",
    "traditionally , dynamical methods have been used to obtain masses .",
    "all dynamical methods make some assumption regarding the dynamical equilibrium of the system .",
    "furthermore , some methods , such as the tully - fisher @xcite relation or the fundamental plane @xcite only probe the inner regions of the halo .",
    "other methods , such as satellite kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reach further out in the halo but are difficult to apply at intermediate redshifts due to the faintness of the satellites .",
    "a powerful alternative approach to these dynamical methods is to use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of galaxy dm haloes @xcite .",
    "weak lensing is sensitive to all of the matter that surrounds the galaxy and along the line of sight .",
    "because galaxy - galaxy lensing ( ggl ) is an ensemble mean measurement , this includes matter that is statistically correlated with galaxy haloes : in other words , ggl is measuring the galaxy - matter cross - correlation function .",
    "this has led to the development of a `` halo model '' ( e.g. * ? ? ? * hereafter m06 ) to interpret the ggl measurements in a similar way as had been done in studies of galaxy clustering . the halo model has been applied to recent weak lensing data sets from the rcs2 by @xcite , and the cfht lensing survey ( cfhtlens ) by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter v14 ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is to use ggl to study galaxy evolution , or more specifically , the evolution with redshift of the stellar - to - halo - mass ratio ( hereafter shmr ) . in this sense , this paper parallels recent efforts to extend the abundance matching and hod methods to higher redshifts .",
    "the promise of using ggl to probe galaxy evolution goes back to @xcite , who found no relative evolution between the ggl signal in the hubble deep field and the low - redshift tully - fisher and faber - jackson relations .",
    "* hereafter l12 ) performed a combined hod analysis using ggl , abundance matching and correlation functions on cosmos data .",
    "they found that the peak value of the shmr did not evolve with redshift , but that shmr `` downsizes '' in the sense that the halo ( and stellar ) mass at which it peaks decreases with cosmic time .",
    "the rcs2 ggl study of @xcite examined the evolution of the shmr but lacked the statistical power to place strong constraints . v14",
    "analyzed ggl in the cfhtlens , but limited to the redshift range @xmath11 .",
    "the combination of depth and area of the cfhtlens sample allows us , for the first time , to split lens samples by redshift , colour and stellar mass , and hence to measure the evolution of the shmr using only ggl .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss the cfhtlens shape and photometric redshift ( hereafter photo-@xmath12 ) data in section  [ sec : data ] , and describe the halo model in section  [ sec : models ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "results ] , we show the fits of the halo model to the weak lensing data .",
    "the shmr is discussed in section  [ sec : shmr ] , and the ggl results are compared with shmr results from other methods . in section  [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss the interpretation of the shmr in terms of models of star formation and quenching .",
    "we also compare our results for faint blue galaxies to determinations from galaxy rotation curves .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec : conc ] .    throughout",
    "we adopt a ` 737 ' cdm  cosmology : a hubble parameter , @xmath13 , a matter density parameter @xmath14 and a cosmological constant @xmath15 the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are consistent with the current best - fit wmap9 cosmology .",

    "there is a well known tension between the planck value of @xmath19 and that derived by @xcite , the value adopted here lies in between these .",
    "all masses , distances and other derived quantities are calculated using this value of @xmath19 .",
    "the data used in this paper is based on the `` wide synoptic '' and `` pre - survey '' components of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , a joint project between canada and france .",
    "the cfhtlens collaboration analysed these data and produced catalogues of photometry , photometric redshifts and galaxy shapes as described below .",

    "the megacam camera is an array of @xmath20 ccds with a field of view of 1  deg@xmath21 .",

    "the ellipticities are almost unbiased estimates of the gravitational shear : there is a small multiplicative correction discussed in section  [ sec : stacking ] below .",

    "we select lenses in the range @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we use the megaprime rest - frame  colours to separate red and blue galaxies , with the division at @xmath40 , independent of magnitude or redshift , as we observe no strong evolution in the red / blue division .",
    "the colour magnitude diagram for lenses in three different redshift bins is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : urz ] .",
    "this criterion is similar to , but not identical to that of v14 , who used the fitted spectral template type @xmath41 to separate the red and blue populations . in this paper",
    "we choose to use colour to make subsequent comparisons with our results more straightforward .",
    "this corresponds approximately to @xmath42 , similar to the colour @xmath43 used by @xcite to separate red and blue galaxies at faint luminosities in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "in addition to the red / blue colour separation discussed above , we will bin lenses by redshift ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) . with these cuts",
    "there are 1.62 blue galaxies and 4.50 red galaxies , for a total of 2.06 lenses .",
    "we will also bin lenses by @xmath24-band luminosity / stellar mass .",
    "however , the stellar masses of individual galaxies are noisy . were we to bin by stellar mass , the noise would introduce eddington - like biases , and this would require simulations to correct ( as in e.g.  v14 ) . instead , we bin by @xmath47-band luminosity and use the mean stellar - mass - to - light ratio for that bin to calculate the mean stellar mass of the bin .",
    "the @xmath24-band magnitude limits for the bins are chosen for red and blue galaxies separately so that the stellar mass bins are approximately 0.5 dex in width , for @xmath48 .",
    "sources are limited to @xmath49 from unmasked regions of the cfhtls .",
    "we use the full unmasked survey area , including the fields which did not pass cosmic shear systematics tests described in @xcite .",
    "v14 found that , for ggl , there was no difference between results from these fields and the remainder of the survey .",
    "we also limit the source redshifts to @xmath50 , where the photo-@xmath12s are reliable @xcite . excluding masked areas , there are @xmath51 sources , corresponding to an effective source density of @xmath52 @xcite .      from the lens and source samples , we analyse all lens - source pairs with @xmath53 . at the median redshift of the lenses @xmath54 , the typical error in source redshift",
    "is @xmath55 , hence this yields a @xmath56 separation in redshift space .",
    "note that later we will downweight close lens - source pairs , with the result that any physical pairs in which one member is scattered up by photo-@xmath12 errors will have low weight in any case .",
    "we also only consider lens - source pairs that are not too close on the sky .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the shapes of background sources may be affected by the extended surface brightness profile of bright foreground galaxies @xcite .",
    "schrabback et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "have examined this issue via simulated galaxy catalogues including realistic surface brightness distributions .",
    "they find no additive bias for pairs as close as 3 arcseconds .",
    "this angular separation corresponds to 10 kpc at @xmath57 or 22.5 kpc at @xmath58 .",
    "second , it is possible that features within a galaxy ( e.g.  spiral arms ) may be split by the sextractor @xcite software and treated as independent `` sources . ''",
    "these fragments will have assigned photo-@xmath12s , and our cut @xmath53 should remove most of these spurious pairs",
    ". there remains , however , the possibility of residual contamination , and so a cut based on the luminosity profiles of bright disks is also applied .",
    "@xcite find that spiral galaxy disks typically truncate at an isophote corresponding to a @xmath59-band surface brightness of 26 mag .  per square arc second .",
    "the largest discs have low surface brightness ( sb ) ; @xcite find few disks with surface brightness ( measured at the effective radius ) fainter than 24 in @xmath59 .",
    "to be conservative , we use an sb limit of 27 for the isophotal truncation and faint limit of 25 in @xmath60 for the lowest surface brightness galaxies .",
    "this yields an estimated truncation radius of @xmath61 for a @xmath59-band fiducial magnitude of @xmath62 ( or an @xmath24-band magnitude of @xmath63 ) , and a scaling @xmath64 .",
    "we adopt double this for the minimum radius , @xmath65 , for lens - source pairs around blue galaxies , but with a hard lower limit of 20  and a hard upper limit of 50 . for red galaxies ,",
    "we adopt the same minimum radius as for blue galaxies . in practice , then this is always larger than the 3 arcsecond angular cut discussed above . for each bin of redshift and luminosity",
    "we adopt the larger of the two radii as the minimum projected radius of the lens - source pairs .      the excess surface density",
    ", @xmath66 defined as the difference between @xmath67 , the mean projected surface mass density enclosed within a circle of radius @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the average surface density at radius @xmath68 , can be related to the observed tangential shear @xmath70 via @xcite : @xmath71 where critical surface density , @xmath72 , is given by @xmath73 and where @xmath74 is the angular diameter distance to the lens , @xmath75 is the angular diameter distance to the source and @xmath76 is the angular diameter distance between lens and source .",
    "it is necessary to stack a large number of lenses to obtain a statistically significant signal .",
    "we calculate the surface mass density as a function of projected separation , @xmath68 , by summing the tangential component of the source ellipticities over all lens - source pairs .",

    "the sources behind it become fainter and smaller and so the correction rises to 9% at @xmath90 .    the scatter in the photo-@xmath12s of lenses and sources",
    "will also introduce a bias in quantities such as the redshift and luminosity of the lens and the distance ratio @xmath91 .",
    "appendix [ sec : photozscatter ] discusses how we use simulations of mock catalogues to estimate these biases .",
    "these bias estimates are then used to correct all affected quantities .",
    "we will fit the data with simple halo models that describe the average distribution of total matter around a given galaxy , i.e.  the matter - galaxy cross - correlation @xmath92 .",
    "this can be broken into several terms : the first arises from the galaxy s own stellar mass and halo , or subhalo if it is a satellite .",
    "the second term is the `` offset group - halo '' term and is the mean distribution of dm around a given satellite galaxy due to the host halo that the satellite inhabits . the third term , which we neglect here because it is important only on very large ( @xmath93 kpc ) scales , is the two - halo term , which represents the matter in separate haloes that are correlated with the host halo .",
    "this yields : @xmath94 we now describe each term in more detail .",
    "the so - called one - halo term arises from matter within the galaxy s own halo : its stars , , and its dm halo .",
    "the stellar mass is modelled as a point source : @xmath95 the dm is modelled as a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) density profile , parametrized by a virial mass , @xmath96 , defined within the radius @xmath97 enclosing a mean density 200 times the critical density and a concentration @xmath98 with @xmath99 being the nfw scale radius .",
    "the concentration of the dm halo , @xmath100 , is not free , but instead is fixed as a function of @xmath96 and redshift @xmath12 using the relation given by @xcite , converted from @xmath101 to @xmath102 using the method of @xcite .",
    "the excess surface density @xmath103 for an nfw profile is given in @xcite .    while the nfw profile has been shown to be a good description of isolated haloes , the dm haloes of satellite galaxies",
    "are expected to be tidally stripped by their `` host '' dm halo @xcite .",
    "this effect has been observed in clusters of galaxies by weak lensing @xcite .",
    "weak lensing has also been used to detect this effect statistically within groups and clusters in the cfhtlens sample itself by @xcite .",
    "they found that , on average , satellites in high density environments had @xmath104 of their mass stripped , or , equivalently , were stripped to a truncation radius of @xmath105 .",
    "here we adopt a truncation radius @xmath106 , which is consistent with the @xcite result , but which allows a straightforward comparison with the results of previous authors ( m06,v14 ) .",
    "for this truncated nfw profile ( tnfw ) , we assume @xmath107 beyond the truncation radius : @xmath108 the effect of this assumption is examined in greater detail in appendix [ sec : subhalo ] .    in each galaxy subsample",
    "as binned by mass , colour and redshift , a fraction , , of the galaxies will be satellites with the remainder being  central \" galaxies .",
    "thus the one - halo term consists of the stellar mass , plus a mean ( weighted by satellite fraction ) of the central and stripped satellite dark haloes .",
    "note that because of the stripping prescription , for satellites , the fitted value of the parameter @xmath96 is the mass before they fell into their host halo . in summary , @xmath109 the total one - halo mass , @xmath110 is the sum of the baryons and the nfw @xmath96 .      on intermediate scales ( 200 ",
    "1000 kpc ) , the  offset - group - halo \" term dominates the  signal .",
    "this term is given by eqs .",
    "11 - 13 of @xcite . in brief",
    ", this arises for satellite galaxies only and is due to the dm in their host halo .",
    "it is a convolution of the projected nfw profile with the distribution of satellites , and so it depends on the mass of the host group , the concentration , @xmath31 , of the dm in that group halo and , because it is a convolution of satellite positions , it also depends on the radial distribution of the satellites with respect to group centre . as with the 1-halo term , we assume that the hosting dm haloes have concentrations given by the prescription of @xcite",
    ". the distribution of satellite host halo masses is taken from the halo model of @xcite .",
    "finally , we assume that the concentration of satellites , @xmath111 , is the same as that of the dm , which is consistent with the assumptions made by v14 and @xcite .",
    "the satellite fraction , @xmath112 is constrained by the offset - group term .",
    "in addition to the predicted @xmath92 , a full treatment of the halo model also contains a detailed prescription of how galaxies occupy haloes as a function of their magnitude and as a function of the halo mass . v14",
    "adopt a halo model in which the parameters of the offset - group term are coupled to the one halo term . the approach taken here",
    "is somewhat different : for satellites , we will adopt the hod parameters from @xcite .",
    "this then specifies the distribution of host halo masses for a given satellite stellar mass and hence the _ shape _ of the offset - group term .",
    "the model for the one - halo term is thus independent of that of the offset - group term .",
    "this leaves only two free parameters : @xmath96 of the one - halo term ; and the satellite fraction , @xmath113 .    in practice",
    ", there is some degeneracy between the satellite fraction and the one - halo mass .",
    "@xcite show that there is little evolution in the satellite fraction in their hod fits and that it is consistent with a linear function in magnitude ( or , equivalently , log stellar mass ) .",
    "we adopt these constraints , and fit a non - evolving linear satellite fraction .",

    "the shmr does evolve in the sense that the peak stellar - to - halo mass ratio drops as a function of time .",
    "this result is formally statistically significant at the 99.99% confidence level for our parametric model .",
    "as the peak halo mass remains constant , this means that it is the peak stellar mass which is evolving towards lower stellar masses as the galaxy redshift decreases .",
    "this is consistent with a simple model in which the stellar mass at which galaxies are quenched evolves towards a lower stellar mass with time .",
    "the population of blue galaxies does not evolve strongly in the shmr diagram .",

    "the comparisons in @xcite show that the bias is generally not a monotonic function of magnitude , so extrapolating from the brighter lenses to the fainter sources might be dangerous . they also show that at the faintest magnitudes , corresponding to the cfhtlens sources , the bias appears to be small .",
    "here we describe the corrections to the observables that are necessary because of the fact that photometric redshifts have scatter @xmath316 as emphasised by @xcite and @xcite , this scatter leads to eddington - like biases in several quantities of importance for weak lensing : the mean redshifts of the lenses and consequently the mean luminosities and stellar masses of the lenses , as well as the @xmath91 ratio . while the cfhtlens photo-@xmath12 scatter is less than the sdss photo-@xmath12 scatter ( @xmath317 ) studied by @xcite , it is nevertheless important to include these corrections .",
    "we simulate these effects by using mock galaxy populations with known redshift and luminosity distributions , then scattering their true redshifts and re - calculating all quantities that depend on this redshift ( luminosity , stellar mass , @xmath91 ratio and so on ) .",
    "we then select lens samples in bins of ( scattered ) luminosity and redshift ( as is done for the cfhtlens sample ) and so determine the bias in these quantitites that arises from the scatter in the photometric redshifts .    specifically , we select galaxies from light - cones samples of @xcite based on the semi - analytic models of @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that these are excellent fits to the observed number counts , @xmath318 and luminosity functions over the ranges covered by the cfhtlens lens sample ( @xmath319 , @xmath2 ) .",

    "* ) , however , one wants instead the halo mass as a function of stellar mass .",
    "while it is possible to use equation  ( [ eq : mstelscat ] ) to obtain @xmath320 as a function of @xmath110 and invert this numerically , this requires knowledge of the halo mass function and so it is more complicated to implement numerically .    in order that readers may easily obtain the halo mass as a function of stellar mass , in this section , we give fits to a modified version of equation  ( [ eq : moster ] ) , in which the shm ratio is a function of stellar mass @xmath320 . specifically , equation  ( [ eq : moster ] )",
