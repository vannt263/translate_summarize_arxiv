    "the singularity theorems tell us that singularities occur under very general circumstances in general relativity ( gr ) , but they say little about their nature ",
    "detailed insights require further analysis of einstein s field equations .",
    "of particular interest is the structure of generic singularities ; it is probably fair to say that there have historically been three ` dominant ' approaches to address this issue : ( i ) the metric approach used by belinskii , lifshitz , and khalatnikov  @xcite ( henceforth these authors , and their work , are referred to as bkl ) , ( ii ) the hamiltonian approach , and ( iii ) the dynamical systems approach , which will be the main topic of the present paper , but let us begin with a brief historical review .    during the sixties , seventies , and early eighties , bkl performed a heuristic analysis that eventually resulted in the conjecture that a generic singularity is _ spacelike _ , _ local _ , _ vacuum dominated _ , and _ oscillatory _ , when the matter source is a perfect fluid with a radiation equation of state , or more precisely : the time evolution of a solution in the vicinity of a generic singularity is described by a sequence of generalized kasner solutions , where one generalized kasner solution is linked to the next by a generalized vacuum bianchi type ii solution , leading to an oscillatory behavior , discretely described by a chaotic kasner map  @xcite . to reach these conclusions",
    "bkl ( i ) employed synchronous coordinates , i.e. gaussian normal coordinates , such that the singularity occurred simultaneously , ( ii ) considered certain spatially homogeneous ( sh ) metrics , ( iii ) replaced constants with spatial functions , ( iv ) inserted the resulting expressions into einstein s field equations as a starting point for a perturbative expansion which yielded a consistency check , which , after some difficulties , led to the above scenario .    in the late sixties and early seventies the bkl picture obtained heuristic support from results obtained by the hamiltonian approach to asymptotic bianchi type ix dynamics developed by misner and chitr  @xcite . in one variation of this approach the dynamical evolution towards the singularity",
    "is described in terms of free motion in an abstract flat lorentzian ` minisuperspace '   surrounded by potential walls , or alternatively by means of a spatial projection in minisuper space which leads to free motion inside a potential well described by moving walls ; for further use and developments of this picture , see the review by jantzen  @xcite and  @xcite [ chapter 10 ] . in another version of the hamiltonian approach misner and chitr  @xcite described the asymptotic dynamics by projecting the motion in minisuperspace onto a region in hyperbolic space bounded by sharp walls , forming a ` billiard table ' ,",
    "see  @xcite . the hamiltonian approach was later generalized so that the general inhomogeneous case could also be studied , culminating in the recent work by damour , henneaux , and nicolai ( aimed primarily at a broader string theoretic context ) , see  @xcite and references therein .    despite the indisputable ingenuity and power of the bkl and the hamiltonian approaches , they have unfortunately yielded rather vague statements from a rigorous mathematical point of view , and this has led to considerable debate .",
    "but there exist exceptions in non - oscillatory cases : rigorous results have been obtained by moncrief , isenberg , berger , and collaborators , who also obtained numerical support for the general basic bkl picture , see  @xcite , and  @xcite for a review and additional references ; note also the successful use of so - called fuchsian methods as regards theorems about asymptotic non - oscillatory dynamics , particularly the result by andersson and rendall  @xcite for the general case of a stiff fluid or massless scalar field .",
    "the last decade has seen a remarkable theoretical development in sh cosmology , largely in connection with the book `` dynamical systems in cosmology ''  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of e.g.  perfect fluid models are now to a large extent understood in terms of rigorous statements , of which many have been elevated to mathematical theorems .",
    "notably , ringstrm obtained the first theorems about oscillatory behavior for bianchi type viii and , more substantially , type ix  @xcite models .",
    "the progress in this area is due to the use of dynamical systems techniques applied to the ` dynamical systems approach ' to sh cosmology , see  @xcite .    in an attempt to broaden the success to the general inhomogeneous case , uggla , van elst , wainwright , and",
    "ellis  @xcite introduced a dynamical systems formulation for einstein s field equations without any symmetries .",
    "this led to a description of generic asymptotic dynamics towards a generic spacelike singularity in terms of an attractor , which resulted in mathematically precise conjectures .",
    "furthermore , this formulation served as a basis for numerical investigations of generic singularities , which yielded additional support for the expected generic picture as well as the discovery of new phenomena and subsequent refinements  @xcite .",
    "recently this work was given a more sound geometric foundation  @xcite , and further steps were taken by heinzle , uggla , and rhr  @xcite to sharpen and substantiate exact rigorous mathematical statements about generic asymptotic dynamics towards a generic spatial singularity  a development we focus on below .",
    "let us consider a generic spacelike singularity , for simplicity located in the past , which motivates referring to it as a ` cosmological singularity . ' in this `",
    "cosmological ' context it is natural to focus on temporal aspects and investigate spacetime changes along a timelike reference congruence that originates from the singularity .",
    "let us assume that we are sufficiently close to the singularity so that the expansion @xmath0 is positive , where @xmath1 is the future - directed unit tangent vector field of the reference congruence and where @xmath2 is the covariant derivative associated with the physical metric @xmath3 .",
    "although the singularity theorems say little about the nature of singularities , the very definition of a singularity and the one dynamical input that goes into the theorems  the raychaudhuri equation for the expansion  provide clues to how one might continue in the quest to understand what happens in the vicinity of a generic spacelike singularity .",
    "the existence of a singularity by definition implies a prominent variable scale  the affine parameter distance from / to the singularity of a causal inextendible geodesic that is used to define it , or , alternatively , the expansion ( cf . frw cosmology where the hubble variable @xmath4 is frequently used to obtain a characteristic time scale , @xmath5 , from the initial singularity ) .",
    "however , the key role played by the raychaudhuri equation in the singularity theorems suggests that the expansion is particularly important  especially so in the case of a generic spacelike singularity where the expansion is expected to blow up , so that einstein s field equations break down .",
    "causal properties constitute an important feature in gr  particularly in the derivation of the singularity theorems  and there are good reasons to believe that asymptotic causal properties are absolutely crucial in the case of a generic spacelike singularity : we expect a generic spacelike singularity to be a scalar curvature singularity , associated with increasing ultra strong gravity that focuses light in all directions as the singularity is approached , leading to _ asymptotic silence _ , which we define as the formation of particle horizons that shrink to zero size in all directions along any time line that approaches the singularity , thus increasingly prohibiting communication ; for various special examples of asymptotic silence and asymptotic silence - breaking , see lim et al .",
    "@xcite .    in relativity , due to the causal structure that links space and time",
    ", there only exists a single dimensional unit , leaving us with one dimensional scale .",
    "the above discussion suggests that one should adapt to the asymptotic ` dominant ' scale and causal properties and asymptotically _ regularize _ einstein s equations by factoring out the expansion or , equivalently , the hubble variable @xmath4 , so that one obtains dimensionless state space variables that take _ finite _ values and capture the ` essential ' dynamics : the geometric and natural way to do this is by means of a conformal transformation ; since @xmath3 and @xmath6 have dimensional weight [ ` length']@xmath7 ( or equivalently [ ` time']@xmath7 ) , the appropriate transformation is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless unphysical metric .    to obtain a formulation that reduces to the hubble - normalized dynamical systems approach in sh cosmology , used in e.g.  @xcite , as a special case ,",

    "in addition to these variables there also exist gauge variables @xmath39 : the @xmath26 fermi rotation variables are gauge variables associated with the choice of frame ; @xmath25 is regarded as a gauge variable determined by the choice of @xmath40 ( or equivalently @xmath41 ) .",

    "the conformally hubble - normalized dimensionless system of coupled partial differential equations are obtained from the above hubble - normalized commutator equations , which define @xmath42 and @xmath39 in terms of derivatives of the metric ; the jacobi identities , which act as integrability conditions for going over to an essentially first order formulation ; and einstein s field equations  @xcite  the equations can be divided into gauge equations , evolution equations , and constraint equations .",

    "note that the hubble - normalized dimensionless equation system carries the essential dynamical content , since once it is integrated the solution can be inserted into the decoupled dimensional equations for @xmath34 , which subsequently can be integrated .    to obtain a determined system of evolution equations one needs to specify the spatial frame .",

    "this choice of frame leads to the so - called iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric @xmath62 : @xmath63 using an iwasawa based conformal hubble - normalized frame , which we from now on do , leads to @xmath64  @xcite .",

    "below , apart from in the concluding remarks , we will discuss the generic case where the evolution is assumed to be asymptotically local .",

    "the equations on the silent boundary are identical to the equations for @xmath72 for spatially self - similar or sh models  @xcite , where the sh case is obtained by setting @xmath74 the particular importance of the ` sh silent boundary ' in the study of generic spacelike singularities stems from its connection with asymptotically local dynamics ; compare eqs .   and  . moreover , since the field equations in the conformal hubble - normalized orthonormal frame approach are regular towards the singularity , we can _ extend _ the state space to include the silent boundary in our analysis of the dynamical system .",
    "this is highly advantageous , since our above reasoning leads to the conjecture that solutions in the full state space generically asymptotically approach and _ shadow _ the solutions on the sh silent boundary .",
    "the sh silent boundary consists of a number of invariant subsets ( ` components ' ) that are connected by parts of their boundary only , where the precise structure depends on the choice of frame . utilizing an iwasawa frame leads to equations on each component which are the same as those for bianchi types i  vii , but there is no component associated with bianchi type viii or ix .",

    "if a generic solution approaches the sh part of the silent boundary , then due to the regularity of the equations , it will asymptotically approach the attractor on this subset .",
    "our experience with sh cosmology suggests that this attractor is somehow connected with the bianchi type i and ii subsets on the silent boundary , but that it also depends on the choice of frame .",
    "dynamical systems investigations usually begin by looking for fixed points ( equilibrium points ) and then one subsequently linearizes the equations at these points to obtain a local picture of dynamical features . in the iwasawa gauge",
    "there exists a representation of the ( vacuum ) bianchi type i , i.e. kasner , solutions on the silent boundary as a one - parameter set of fixed points , which play a key role for the asymptotic dynamics ; this set of fixed points is referred to as the _ kasner circle _ @xmath86 , and is determined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",

    "we observe ` bounces ' at the fixed points on the kasner circle @xmath86 , which act as a ` wall ' , and between bounces we have motion along straight lines in ( euclidean ) @xmath157-space ( transitions ) , see fig .",
    "3(@xmath56 ) .",
    "thus the hamiltonian ` motion  bounce  motion  bounce ' is replaced with ` bounce  motion  bounce  motion ' in the dynamical systems billiards . in the hamiltonian approach the essential asymptotic dynamical evolution",
    "is described by ` configuration space ' variables ( related to diagonalized spatial metric variables ) while in the dynamical systems approach it is described in terms of ` momentum space ' variables ( @xmath157 are related to time derivatives of the diagonalized spatial metric , and thus to the associated momenta ) .",
    "the two approaches thus give _ complementary ` dual ' representations _ of the generic asymptotic dynamics ; to compare the two pictures , see fig .",
    "[ dualfig ] .",
    "in addition the two approaches mutually support each other and strengthen the credibility of the generic picture ; moreover , the combined use of both may very well be of relevance for future developments , see  @xcite for further discussion .",

    "in this paper we have presented the conformal hubble - normalized dynamical systems approach , and outlined the derivation of the billiard attractor and established its ` dual ' correspondence with the hamiltonian cosmological billiard of damour et al .",
    "@xcite , but it is also of interest to make a comparison with bkl : the generalized kasner solution is obtained by inserting the values of @xmath42 at the kasner circle @xmath86 into the equations for @xmath21 and @xmath34 , and thus this ` solution ' is obtained as the lowest order perturbation of @xmath86 into the physical state space ( @xmath169 ) ; similarly the generalized bianchi type ii solutions correspond to single curvature transitions @xmath160the ad hoc starting point of bkl is thereby derived .",
    "furthermore , as discussed , asymptotic ( attractor ) sequences connect and yield precise meaning to bkl s ` piecewise approximations , ' and thus the results of bkl s analysis are rigorously formulated as special structures in the full extended dynamical systems picture .    here",
    "we have been concerned with the vacuum case .",
    "however , the methods employed in  @xcite are equally applicable to many other theories , see e.g.  @xcite , and to sources as well .",
    "regarding possible sources this naturally leads to a study of the influence of matter on generic spacelike singularities , i.e. structural stability of generic singularities , and this in turn leads to a variety of issues , e.g. , can the following be made more substantial ? generic singularities seem to bring out the essential properties of matter .",
    "there are indications that it is natural to base a classification of the influence of matter on generic singularity structure on ( i ) energy conditions and ( ii ) whether the effective propagation speed is less than that of light or not .",
    "there are also indications that suggest a subclassification based on how ` matter matters ' in the light speed case , e.g. massless scalar fields and electromagnetic fields influence the generic spacelike singularity in different ways ; does this motivate a subclassification based on spin ? if we assume the usual energy conditions and consider the case of less than light speed propagation , then ` matter does not seem to matter ' for generic asymptotic dynamics towards a generic singularity ",
    "solutions are said to be ` vacuum dominated ' , or more precisely , the hubble - normalized energy - momentum tensor tends to zero so that the geometry is asymptotically described by vacuum solutions .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that e.g. the hubble - normalized rotation of a perfect fluid tends to zero , which suggests a subclassification based on features that are ( if any ) , or are not , affected by matter .",
    "another issue is how and if matter influences the connection between generic spacelike singularities and weak null singularities in asymptotically flat spacetimes ( there are indications that e.g. vlasov matter behaves differently than perfect fluids  @xcite ) ; for special examples , see  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have assumed that the dynamical evolution along generic time lines is associated with asymptotic silence and asymptotic local dynamics , which is supported by the results in  @xcite , but this does not mean that there could not exist interesting phenomena associated with _ special _",
    "time lines , indeed , we believe that a set of time lines of measure zero exhibits spike formation and recurring ` spike transitions '  @xcite , associated with non - local dynamics and the formation of large spatial gradients  but asymptotic silence still holds . in this context",
    "it is important to note that even though spatial partial derivatives grow without bounds , the hubble - normalized spatial frame derivatives and the dimensionless state space variables are still bounded , i.e. , asymptotic regularization still holds !",
    "moreover , spike transitions seem to be connected with asymptotically local dynamics and are governed by variations of the kasner map , hinting at further more deeply hidden structures .",
    "asymptotic spike formation is associated with the fact that the unstable variables @xmath170 go through a zero at a spatial surface , but the underlying mechanisms of spike formation and possible spike annihilation are not completely understood  @xcite : where and why do spikes form ?",
    "do there exist spikes that persist and lead to infinite sequences of spike transitions ( infinite recurring spike transitions ) ? do spikes annihilate spikes , and if so how : through ` spike interference ' ?",
    "is spike formation more common than spike annihilation so that ` spike cascading ' occurs ?",
    "how many spikes form : do they form a dense set ?",
    "do spikes`gravitational defect - like ' surfaces from the very early universe ",
    "leave possible observational imprints in e.g. the cmb ?",
    "it clearly is of interest to answer these questions , moreover , a clarification of some of these issues is of considerable interest in the context of eventual generic singularity proofs .",
    "finally , one may ask why one should study generic singularities at all in a classical gr context ?",
    "firstly , there exists a regime between the planck and gut eras in the very early universe where gr is expected to hold and where the approach towards the initial singularity presumably is described by the dynamics towards a generic singularity ( recall that one of the points of inflation is to ` erase the effects of initial data , ' and that before this erasure a singularity is presumably generic according to this line of reasoning ) .",
    "secondly , black hole formation is connected with initial data that reflects the complexities of the real universe ; one would hence also in this case expect generic spacelike singularities to play a role before one enters the planck regime .",
    "thirdly , the formation of generic singularities is associated with considerable structure ( for the exploitation of some of these structures in the context of quantization of special models , see e.g.  @xcite ) , even in the case of spike formation : can this structure be used to asymptotically quantize gravity where it needs to be quantized , namely in the ultra strong gravitational field in the neighborhood of a generic spacelike singularity ?      this research has been partially supported by the swedish research council .",
