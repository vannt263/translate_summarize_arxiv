    "star polymers are macromolecular entities consisting of @xmath0 polymeric arms chemically attached to a common centre . at the limit where the number of monomers per arm ( degree of polymerisation ) @xmath2 is large , the size of the central core of the star is negligible compared with the overall radius of the macromolecular aggregate and can be ignored at a first approximation .",
    "scaling theory has provided insight into the structure and conformation of a _ single _ star and the way that these properties are influenced by the arm number ( functionality ) @xmath0 , @xmath2 and solvent quality @xcite . from both theoretical and experimental points of view , it is even more interesting to describe the properties of _ dense _ star polymer solutions by means of an effective pair potential between star centres . experimentally , this is important as interstar correlations are ubiquitous in understanding neutron scattering spectra of dense star polymer solutions .",
    "moreover , such a description of stars establishes a bridge between polymer and colloidal science : indeed , due to their peculiar construction , star polymers can be viewed as hybrids between polymers and colloidal particles .",
    "once such a description has been established , it is then possible to look at a star polymer solution as an effective one - component system of point particles ( the star centres ) and employ the known machinery from liquid state theory and/or computer simulations to study its properties .    by way of direct comparison with experimental data ,",
    "it was found recently that star polymers in a good solvent can be described by an effective pair potential which is logarithmic for short distances and crosses over to a yukawa form for larger interstar separations @xcite . this is a new type of interaction in the sense that ( i ) it has an ultra - soft logarithmic core whose hardness depends in fact on the functionality @xmath0 in a way which will be explained shortly and ( ii ) it features a crossover from one functional form to another at some length scale @xmath3 which is of the order of the corona diameter of the star .",
    "systems which are described by simple , spherically symmetric interactions have been studied extensively in the last thirty years , since the development of powerful computers made integral equation theories and simulations computationally tractable @xcite . for most of the commonly considered interactions ( power laws , yukawa , square - well or square - shoulder potentials etc . )",
    "the liquid structure factor @xmath4 features a single characteristic length which is basically set by the density .",
    "moreover , the correlations in structure grow with increasing density @xmath5 until , at some temperature - dependent value , the system crystallises .",
    "we call the liquids for which such a scenario materialises _ usual _ or _ normal_. the purpose of this paper is to show that star polymer solutions are unusual , in the sense that @xmath4 or its real - space counterpart , the radial distribution function @xmath6 have quite unexpected behaviour above the overlap concentration of the solution . the latter is defined as the polymer concentration at which the stars start overlapping within their corona . there exist two competing length scales which manifest themselves in the form of a structure factor whose peaks do not grow simultaneously in height as @xmath5 increases , but rather lower order peaks grow higher until they completely dominate and the original main peak disappears .",
    "these two lengths are the average interparticle distance @xmath7 and the corona diameter @xmath3 of the stars .",
    "moreover , for low enough functionality , freezing does not take place , i.e. , the system remains fluid at all densities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the model pair potential and briefly discuss its properties . in section 3 we present results from computer simulations and integral equation theories regarding the structure of the system for a very wide range of densities demonstrating the unusual features and we discuss their origin . in section 4",
    "we present a simple ` hard - sphere mapping ' argument to establish the limit of @xmath0 beyond which the system does not crystallise . in section 5",
    "we discuss the connection with experiments .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarise and conclude .",
    "our starting point is the pair potential between two star polymers in a good solvent separated by a centre - to - centre distance @xmath8 , which reads as : @xmath9       \\;\\ ; ( r \\leq \\sigma ) ; \\cr              ( 5/18 ) f^{3/2 } ( 1+\\sqrt{f}/2)^{-1 }              ( \\sigma / r ) \\exp[-\\sqrt{f}(r-\\sigma)/2\\sigma ]       \\;\\;(r > \\sigma ) , } \\label{poten}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 is the absolute temperature .",
    "this is an entropic interaction stemming from excluded volume effects between monomers belonging to two different stars in a good solvent .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the length scale @xmath3 has to be chosen as twice the distance between the centre of the star and the centre of the largest ( outermost ) blob @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic form of the interaction for interparticle distances @xmath12 results from the arguments of witten and pincus @xcite .",
    "for @xmath13 we take an exponential form for the interaction with a decay length equal to the largest blob diameter . for details on the determination of the overall numerical prefactor of the logarithmic term",
    ", we refer the reader to ref .  .",
    "the amplitude of the yukawa tail is finally determined by the requirement of smoothness of the interaction at @xmath14 . in what follows we use @xmath3 as the unit of length and introduce a dimensionless ` packing fraction ' @xmath15 defined as : @xmath16    it has been shown in ref .",
    "that this choice of a pair potential @xcite brings about good agreement between theory and experiment regarding small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) data for a wide range of densities ( or polymer volume fraction ) .",
    "moreover , a similar exponential ` cutoff ' of the logarithmic part of the interaction has also been employed recently in a study of the elastic moduli of block copolymer micelles @xcite .",
    "the entropic nature of the interaction renders the temperature @xmath11 irrelevant , as the boltzmann factor @xmath17 is temperature - independent .",
    "instead , the arm number @xmath0 plays now the role of an effective inverse temperature .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath18 the interaction vanishes , whereas at the `` colloidal limit '' @xmath19 we recover the well - known hard sphere ( hs ) interaction . in fig .  [ stars ] we show the pair potential for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "whereas for large @xmath20 and @xmath21 there is a spectacular change in its behaviour as @xmath8 crosses @xmath3 , for low @xmath0-values , the potential is ultra - soft and its range becomes longer .",
    "as will be shown in section 4 , the ultra - soft character of the interaction at hand , has the consequence that , for low enough values of the functionality @xmath0 , the system never crystallises , no matter how large the density or external pressure are .",
    "thus , this system offers us a unique possibility to examine the behaviour of the structural functions of the liquid ( the radial distribution function and/or the structure factor ) over a practically unlimited range of densities .",
    "this is the subject of the following section .",
    "first , we summarise some basic notions from the theory of classical liquids and refer the reader to ref .   for details .",
    "a quantity of central interest for a classical fluid in equilibrium is the so - called radial distribution function @xmath6 and the closely associated pair correlation function @xmath22 . if we call @xmath5 the number density of the liquid , then the quantity @xmath23 is nothing else but the density profile that develops if we keep a particle fixed at the origin . in other words ,",
    "the quantity @xmath6 expresses the ordering of the rest of the system around a given particle of the liquid .",
    "equivalently , one can look at the structure factor @xmath4 which is simply @xmath5 times the fourier transform of the pair correlation function .",
    "the peaks of @xmath4 reveal information about the characteristic length scales in the system .",
    "alternatively , @xmath6 is more appropriate if one wishes to determine , e.g. , the average coordination number of the liquid .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath4 can be measured in a standard monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "we have thus performed such simulations for a wide range of densities and , in addition , we have solved the rogers - young ( ry ) closure @xcite in order to obtain a comparison .",
    "after ascertaining that the ry gives quite reliable results for all the densities for which simulations were carried out , we relied on this closure to calculate the structure of the fluid for very high packings ( @xmath24 ) , where a simulation would be very expensive since a very large number of particles in the simulation box would be necessary in order to obtain reliable results .    in fig .",
    "[ gofrsim ] we show representative results in order to provide a comparison of the radial distribution function @xmath6 obtained from simulations with the ry result for various different values of @xmath15 .",
    "apart from small discrepancies for the intermediate value @xmath25 , it can be seen that the agreement is quite good .",
    "hence , the ry closure is a reliable theoretical tool for the calculation of the pair structure of the liquid .",
    "it should also be noted that for high values of @xmath15 , @xmath26 , the ry closure reduces practically to the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) for our system .",
    "this is expected since , for high densities , we are dealing with a long - range interaction when distances are measures in units of average interparticle distance and the hnc is known to be most accurate precisely for long - range potentials .    the radial distribution function @xmath6 of the system at hand ,",
    "shows the typical evolution of a normal liquid as the density is increased until we reach the overlap density @xmath27 .",
    "this is the density at which the average interparticle distance @xmath28 becomes equal to the length scale @xmath3 .",
    "it corresponds roughly to an overlap packing faction @xmath29 . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the function @xmath6 displays oscillations with a characteristic length scale @xmath31 .",
    "the heights of the peaks of @xmath6 grow with density ; the same behaviour is also observed for the structure factor @xmath4 , of course .",
    "the situation changes above the overlap concentration , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gofranom](a ) . instead of having a main peak of @xmath6 at @xmath32",
    ", we observe that one peak of @xmath6 always remains at slightly outside the logarithmic part at @xmath33 _ regardless of the density_. the ` main ' peak of @xmath6 grows gradually as the density is increased . indeed , at @xmath34 @xmath6 shows just a shoulder preceding the peak at @xmath33 mentioned above and only at @xmath35 can one distinguish a clear peak at @xmath32 .",
    "even then , this peak remains lower than the second until @xmath36 .",
    "thereafter , it overpasses the second peak in height but still , the position of the second peak of @xmath6 is not at twice the distance of the first peak , as is the case for normal liquids , because the latter is determined by the density and the former by the length scale @xmath3 .",
    "this anomaly in @xmath6 is reflected , naturally , in the shape and evolution of the structure factor @xmath4 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gofranom](b ) . as a first remark",
    ", we find that the height of the main peak of @xmath4 , which grows until we reach the overlap packing , becomes _ lower _ above @xmath37 .",
    "more unusual features are observed if one looks at the positions and the competition between the first two peaks . though the second peak remains at twice the position of the first up to @xmath25 , at packing @xmath34 the position of the first peak is practically unchanged with respect to that at @xmath25 , but the second peak now _ moves closer _ to the origin and increases in height .",
    "this trend persists as @xmath15 grows and already at @xmath36 the second peak has become higher than the first , which shows a clear trend of disappearing at higher densities , as it will be confirmed shortly .",
    "this anomaly in the structure factor can be traced to the crossover of the interaction from a yukawa to a logarithmic form _ and _ the softness of the logarithmic potential . indeed , above the overlap concentration the system always tries to maintain one coordination shell _ outside _ the logarithmic part , where the interaction is weak .",
    "at the same time , the softness of the logarithmic core allows two things to happen : on the one hand , qualitatively , the system remains always fluid which would not have been the case if the core was harder ( e.g. a hs core , or even the same , logarithmic form for different @xmath0 , as will be shown in section 4 . ) on the other hand , more quantitatively , the softness of the logarithm allows for a rather broad first peak of the radial distribution function which can accommodate enough particles so as to allow for the second peak to occur immediately outside @xmath14",
    ".    the unusual shape of the structure factor can be understood by means of the existence in @xmath6 of these two different length scales : one length scale @xmath38 , which is manifestly density - dependent and one length scale @xmath39 which is density - independent .",
    "below @xmath37 only the first length scale appears but above @xmath37 both are present .",
    "let us call @xmath40 the position of the @xmath41-th peak of the structure factor .",
    "the first peak of @xmath4 corresponds , roughly , to the length scale @xmath42 , i.e.  @xmath43 and the second peak to the length scale @xmath44 , i.e.  @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ gofranom](b ) , @xmath46 is practically constant , whereas @xmath47 decreases with density , a feature that can be attributed to the increase of the quantity @xmath48 with growing density .",
    "moreover , the growth of the second peak can be understood since the structure that gives rise to it becomes more pronounced with increasing @xmath15 , as the first peak of @xmath6 takes shape .    in these terms",
    ", we can now make the hypothesis that the first peak of the structure factor will disappear altogether when the density is such that @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , the structure factor will have a main peak at a position dictated only by the density , when the length @xmath42 is twice the length @xmath31 in such a way that @xmath6 has exactly two oscillations of wavelength @xmath31 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath53 , it turns out that the density must be such that @xmath54 . as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "eta2](a ) this occurs at the ` magic ' value @xmath55 , where the subscript denotes the number of oscillations of @xmath6 in the interval @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "accordingly , the structure factor at @xmath57 has a strong first peak ( which , however , has evolved from the second peak at lower densities ! ) located at a position @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "[ eta2](b ) we show also the structure factor at @xmath59 in order to show the disappearence of what used to be the first peak of @xmath4 and its replacement by the second one . however , we emphasize that the fact that at @xmath57 we have again a structure factor with its main peak located at a position @xmath60 , does not mean that we are dealing with a normal liquid . indeed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ eta2](b ) the structure factor shows some weak substructure which is not present for usual liquids .",
    "it is now pertinent to ask the question what happens once the density is further increased .",
    "does the height of the new main peak grow until the system solidifies or does the above scenario repeat itself ?",
    "we have solved the ry - closure for packing fractions up to @xmath61 and we find that , in fact , it the second possibility that materialises . as @xmath15 grows ,",
    "the main peak is lowered and the one that used to be the third at low densities grows , see fig .",
    "[ sofk](a ) .",
    "the mechanism that brings about this scenario is no other but the development of more and more oscillations inside the logarithmic core in the function @xmath6 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sofk](b ) .",
    "in fact , one can repeat the argument about the ` magic ' packing fraction @xmath62 above for an arbitrary number of oscillations as follows : the structure factor @xmath4 will be dominated by a single length scale whenever there is an integer number of oscillations @xmath63 between @xmath51 and @xmath64 .",
    "given the magic packing fraction @xmath62 , it is straightforward to show that the general magic packing fraction @xmath65 will be related to @xmath62 by : @xmath66    using @xmath55 we obtain @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the structure factor for these magic values is shown in fig .",
    "[ multip ] . it can be seen clearly that for the @xmath63-th magic value , @xmath4 has a dominant peak located at the position @xmath70 .",
    "as the order @xmath63 grows , the height of the dominant peak also decreases slightly and some substructure develops in @xmath4 .",
    "however , the main length scale comes from the @xmath63 oscillations of the radial distribution function @xmath6 in the logarithmic core .",
    "the above results can be nicely summarised by making a log - log plot of the positions of the first few peaks of the structure factor against the packing fraction @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ loglog ] .",
    "we emphasise here that when we talk about the @xmath41-th peak we actually mean ` the peak which is the @xmath41-th if we extrapolate at low enough densities so that we are in a regime where the liquid is normal . '",
    "the reason for this distinction is that as @xmath15 grows the low - order maxima of the structure factor disappear , as explained above , and as a result what used to be a second - order maximum becomes now first order etc .",
    "this is manifested in fig .",
    "[ loglog ] by the fact that the curves representing the positions of the various maxima @xmath40 stop at some value of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , since a higher - order peak overtakes a lower - order one in height before the latter completely disappears , we indicate the highest peak in fig .",
    "[ loglog ] by the filled symbols .    referring to fig .",
    "[ loglog ] , we can make the following remarks : according to our previous definition , the fluid interacting by means of the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ poten ] ) is normal for packing fractions @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , in this regime on the one hand the first maxima follow the scaling @xmath72 and on the other hand the higher - order maxima @xmath40 are located in positions @xmath73 , both features being a manifestation of the existence of a _ single _ length scale @xmath74 in the structure of the system . above the overlap density",
    "@xmath27 the scaling breaks down .",
    "however , if we extrapolate the straight line with slope @xmath75 which characterises the normal regime to higher densities , we find that it passes precisely through the main maxima at the magic packing fractions @xmath65 . indeed , at those values of the density the length scales @xmath74 and @xmath3 are commensurate and we have an accidental scaling of the main peak of @xmath4 with the @xmath75-power of the density .",
    "however , the higher - order peaks of @xmath4 are still not located at integer multiples of the first one and we are dealing with an unusual fluid for all densities exceeding the overlap density @xmath27 .",
    "the structure factors obtained for the whole range of densities have the characteristic that the maximum height of the main peak in @xmath4 never exceeds the value 2.8 . according to the empirical hansen - verlet criterion @xcite ,",
    "a liquid freezes when the first maximum of the structure factor reaches a value 2.85 .",
    "it was subsequently shown that indeed freezing sets in if the order in the liquid phase , as measured by the first maximum of @xmath4 exceeds this quasi - universal value @xcite .",
    "hence , we have a first indication that for @xmath76 the system does not freeze .",
    "naturally , the same must also hold for smaller @xmath0-values as the logarithmic core is then even softer .",
    "the absence of freezing was also confirmed in our numerical simulations , where for all values of @xmath15 which were simulated ( @xmath77 ) the system remained in a liquid - like configuration , with any order parameter of a hypothetical crystalline solid vanishing .    here , we want to apply a simple hard - sphere mapping procedure in order to corroborate the above results for @xmath76 on the one hand and establish approximately the ` critical arm number ' @xmath78 on the other , which is defined as follows : for @xmath79 the system remains fluid at all densities , but for @xmath80 there is at least one region in the density domain where the system is crystalline .",

    "we take now @xmath139 . defining the packing fraction @xmath15 as in eq .",
    "( [ packfr ] ) above , we have solved the hnc closure for a few different @xmath15-values .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ toysofk ] , where it can be seen that the same nonmonotonic behaviour of the main peak of @xmath4 is observed .",
    "thus , the phenomenon is rather general and it relies on the existence of a soft enough core in the interaction .",
    "such interactions are not uncommon in soft - matter physics .",
    "hence , it would be of great interest if such anomalies could be experimentally observed",
    ".    we finally comment on similarities of the logarithmic potential investigated in this work to a model introduced by uhlenbeck and ford in the early days of liquid - state theory @xcite .",
    "this special model is defined by a gaussian mayer - function @xmath140 , corresonding to the pair potential @xmath141 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , all interparticle correlations can be calculated analytically within the framework of graph theory . for small distances",
    "@xmath8 , the above potential potential reduces to @xmath142 , corresponding to the potential of eq .",
    "( [ poten ] ) with an arm number @xmath143 .",
    "since this arm number is significantly smaller than @xmath144 , we expect the model system of uhlenbeck and ford to be liquid for all densities , corresponding to an equation of state analytical in the density .",
    "employing a pair potential which has been shown to describe correctly the sans data of star polymer solutions in good solvents @xcite , we made quantitative predictions regarding the behaviour of the structure factor as a function of increasing polymer concentration .",
    "in particular , we found that above the overlap concentration , star polymer solutions display features which are unknown for normal liquids , namely a breakdown of the @xmath145-scaling of the positions of the peaks of @xmath4 as well as an anomalous evolution of the heights of these peaks : the lower - order peaks diminish in height and the higher - order ones grow .",
    "furthermore , we applied a hard - sphere mapping and used it as a crude diagnostic tool in order to make preliminary investigations on the topology of the phase diagram of star polymer solutions .",
    "the most striking feature of the hard - sphere mapping procedure is , in our view , the fact that the effective hs packing fraction @xmath99 remains constant at high densities and depends only on the functionality @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that this characteristic is particular to the logarithmic interaction .",
    "we speculate that interactions which are softer than the logarithm will lead to an @xmath99 which will be a _ decreasing _ function of the density .",
    "this has relevance , in particular , to ` bounded ' interactions , i.e. , interactions which do not diverge at the origin , such as the gaussian potential of stillinger @xcite or a simple model of penetrable spheres introduced recently by us @xcite .",
    "another question of great interest is the phase diagram of star polymers .",
    "detailed calculations , based on extensive computer simulations as well as perturbation theory are currently under way .",
    "these calculations allow for the evaluation of the helmholtz free energies of various candidate crystalline phases and , subsequently , the comparison of the latter with that of the fluid phase and the construction of the phase diagram .",
    "preliminary results are in full agreement with those presented here as far as the critical arm number @xmath78 is concerned ; at the same time , they reveal a rich topology of the phase diagram as well as a variety of unusual crystal structures .",
    "the presentation of the phase diagram of star polymers will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "mw thanks the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft for support within the sfb 237 .",
    "notice that the specific value of @xmath105 observed here , is a consequence of the identification of @xmath85 with @xmath91 , resulting in @xmath147 , which is the maximum packing fraction for a @xmath92 crystal of hard spheres . if , e.g. , @xmath85 is identified with the nearest - neighbour distance in a @xmath148 crystal , @xmath149 .",
    "nevertheless , all described features of @xmath103 remain the same ."
