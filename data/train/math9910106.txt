    "this article is motivated by , and addresses , two separate questions .",
    "the first is dijkgraaf and witten s remarkable observation in @xcite based on the path - integral formulation .",
    "they argue that for certain nonsimply - connected lie groups @xmath2 the level @xmath3 in the definition of the chern - simons field theory , which ordinarily must be an integer in order to get a well - defined topological quantum field theory , can be a half - integer and still be expected to yield a sensible theory in the spin category .",
    "one would like to be able to reproduce this observation rigorously in the algebraic / combinatorial quantum group formulation , as part of a general effort to relate these two settings .",
    "the second question has to do with the mysterious ` nonsemisimple ' topological invariants coming from quantum groups discovered by kuperberg @xcite ( generalizing the semisimple version studied by many authors including kuperberg @xcite , barrett and westbury @xcite , and chung , fukuma , and shapere @xcite ) and hennings @xcite ( also considered by lyubashenko @xcite , kerler @xcite , and kauffman and radford @xcite ) , which appear to be closely related to , but distinctly different from , the chern - simons invariants .",
    "the kuperberg invariant , which assigns an invariant of framed three - manifolds to each finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath4 is widely conjectured to be identical to the hennings invariant associated to the quantum double of @xmath5 unfortunately , for a typical hopf algebra the quantum double is quasitriangular , but not necessarily ribbon , while the hennings invariant requires a ribbon hopf algebra ( with some additional nondegeneracy conditions ) .",
    "this additional structure is reflected in the fact that the hennings invariant depends only on a @xmath6-framing ( which can be normalized away with some loss in terms of cutting and pasting relations ) , rather than the more involved framing .",
    "thus one would like to extend the hennings invariant to associate framing - dependent invariants to quasitriangular hopf algebras .",
    "this is especially important because the framing structure represents much of the complexity that makes the kuperberg invariant difficult to work with .",
    "this article solves both of these questions in a common framework . relying on the fact that , crudely speaking , a framing is a spin structure plus a @xmath6-framing , we identify in both the chern - simons and nonsemisimple case the weakening of algebraic structure from ribbon to quasitriangular with a weakening of the topological invariance from dependent on a @xmath6-framing to dependent on a framing .",
    "this identification can be traced ultimately to the link invariant level , where in the quasitriangular case the natural quantities that arise are invariants only of links with even framing or self - linking number .",
    "as interesting as the two questions are separately , the connection between them revealed by this common framework deserves attention also .",
    "the hints of the geometry of chern - simons theory which pervades the kuperberg and hennings invariants seem to demand a physical explanation , and it is to be hoped that a link between kuperberg and hennings algebra on the one hand and dijkgraaf and witten s geometry on the other offers a useful step towards such an explanation .",
    "section 1 gives a combinatorial description of framed three - manifolds ( i.e. , equipped with a spin structure and an even @xmath6-framing ) in terms of surgery on links all of whose components have even framings .",
    "section 2 gives a general framework analogous to reshetikhin and turaev s modular hopf algebras @xcite for constructing invariants of spin manifolds and identifies the invariants of this sort arising from quantum groups with the chern - simons theories meeting dijkgraaf and witten s conditions for spin theories .",
    "also , the @xmath7 theory is identified with kirby and melvin s @xcite spin invariants constructed from quantum @xmath8 and a formulation generalizing theirs is given in general .",
    "finally section 3 defines a hennings - type invariant of spin ( or framed ) three - manifolds starting from a factorizable quasitriangular hopf algebra ( these conditions include the quantum double as a special case ) .",
    "below we offer a more detailed introduction to each of the three sections .",
    "our approach to topological invariants is the now familiar one of what is sometimes called quantum topology : describe the topological entity by some combinatorial data modulo relations generated by a few simple ` moves , ' translate the data to algebraic objects , and observe that , magically , the moves are algebraic relations which the objects at hand satisfy .",
    "of course the magic reflects a hidden and poorly understood geometric underpinning , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the first instance of this approach is even links : links with an even framing on each component . here",
    "the data is a link projection with each component having winding number one , and the moves are kauffman s regular isotopy , weaker than the usual reidemeister or framed reidemeister moves . in the translation of these moves to the language of hopf algebras",
    "we will see that the ribbon conditions are no longer necessary .",
    "the use of winding number one rather than zero corresponds on the algebraic side to evaluating with quantum characters rather than tracial functions , which is fairly natural from the point of view of hopf algebras themselves but does not fit neatly in the language of rigid braided categories .",
    "surgery on framed links produces four - manifolds with three - manifold boundary . with the appropriate moves ( @xmath6-framed kirby moves ) surgery gives a combinatorial description of three - manifolds equipped with the @xmath6-framing needed to regularize chern - simons theory",
    "( see atiyah @xcite , and ) .",
    "surgery on even links produce spin four - manifolds with spin three - manifold boundary . with the appropriate moves ( spin kirby moves ) such an even surgery",
    "give a combinatorial description of spin three - manifolds equipped with a compatible @xmath6-framing .",
    "specifically , the @xmath6-framing has to equal rohlin s @xmath9 invariant modulo @xmath10 since framings of three - manifolds are in one - to - one correspondence with spin structures together with @xmath6-framings , we get a combinatorial description of framed manifolds , but the compatibility puts a constraint on the possible framings .",
    "the exact significance of this restriction as it relates to the framings of kuperberg s invariant is not clear , although since a fixed shift in the @xmath6-framing multiplies each invariant by a fixed quantity , the distinction is fairly minor .",
    "this section also offers a fenn - rourke version of the spin kirby moves which replaces the general handle - slides with a more restrictive ` semilocal ' move .",
    "ribbon categories ( see reshetikhin and turaev @xcite , turaev @xcite , or kassel @xcite ) are the appropriate place to look for framed link invariants , and if they meet some additional conditions ( summarized in the definition of a modular category in @xcite ) they give invariants of @xmath6-framed three - manifolds through the surgery presentation",
    ". one might think that modularity is a very restrictive constraint on a ribbon category , but in fact it is not .",
    "mger @xcite and bruguires @xcite give a kind of quotient of a ribbon @xmath0-category ( bruguires works with a more general but perhaps less natural substitute for the @xmath0-structure ) that roughly speaking deletes the part of the category which provides no link information .",
    "sometimes this quotient results in a modular category .",
    "we say sometimes because the objects which stand in the way of modularity ( called degenerate ) come in two flavors , odd and even , and only the even can be eliminated .",
    "thus the existence of odd degenerate objects is the only obstruction to constructing a modular category from a ribbon category .",
    "the quotient fails to go through for odd degenerate objects because they actually carry some information about the link .",
    "in fact they contribute a factor of @xmath11 raised to the self - linking number for every component they label .",
    "of course if we restrict our attention to even links , there is no information at all , and the quotient can go through .",
    "imitation of the usual reshetikhin - turaev construction in this case yields an invariant of spin and compatibly - framed three - manifolds ( presumably it yields an appropriately modified version of the axioms of topological quantum field theory , but we defer that important question and focus only on the invariants in this article ) . in",
    "the author analyzed the quotient construction applied to subsets of the weyl alcove .",
    "this analysis allows us to identify the levels at which we get a spin chern - simons theory associated to a given simple lie group .    on the geometric side , we generalize dijkgraaf and witten s observation , relying on the integration of the generating class of @xmath12 on spin four - manifolds , to a classification of when the physical interpretation leads us to expect spin theories .",
    "in fact we get complete agreement with the algebraic answer ( there is actually a small subtlety : as in , the dijkgraaf - witten theories often factor as a product of invariants , but the set of all these factors is a complete list of theories arising from quantum groups ) .    finally , we imitate kirby and melvin s construction of spin invariants from quantum @xmath13 at certain levels to arbitrary quantum groups .",
    "in fact we find that it works in just the situations in which there are dijkgraaf - witten theories , and prove that the kirby - melvin spin invariants in fact coincide with the dijkgraaf - witten theories .",
    "kirby and melvin did their computation in quantum @xmath14 and thus associated their invariant with @xmath15 while we do the computation entirely in the set of representations associated to @xmath16 and thus find the invariant more naturally associated to @xmath17 as expected from the geometry and physics .      in the combinatorial version of chern - simons and the other traditional quantum invariants , one does not work with the quantum group itself , which is not semisimple , nor with the whole of the representation theory .",
    "instead one works with a piece of the representation theory modified so as to resemble the representation theory of a semisimple ribbon hopf algebra . the theory outside the weyl alcove , which roughly corresponds to the nonsemisimple part of the quantum group ,",
    "is simply thrown away .",
    "the hennings invariant , by contrast , relies heavily on the nonsemisimple part of the quantum group .",
    "more precisely , the link invariants naturally associated to the three - manifold invariant are labeled by quantum characters , which include the quantum traces of irreducible representations labeling links in reshetikhin and turaev approach , but also include functions associated to nonirreducible representations . what s more the analogue of the surgery label ( called in the sequel @xmath18 ) which reshetikhin and turaev use to construct the three - manifold invariant is the left integral .",
    "this integral turns out to be an element of the socle of the algebra of quantum characters ( roughly , a maximally nilpotent element ) .",
    "the topological effect of this nonsemisimplicity is that the invariant is zero except for rational homology three - spheres and satisfies only a subset of the cut - and - paste axioms of tqft which its semisimple cousins satisfy .",
    "we find for a quasitriangular hopf algebra which is not necessarily ribbon that quantum characters label invariants of even links ( in the presence of a ribbon element , quantum characters and cocommutative functionals can be used almost interchangeably , but in our more delicate situation we find that quantum characters play the more fundamental role ) .",
    "if the algebra is unimodular , the left integral in the dual ( which is also the right integral ) is a quantum character , and in the presence of a nondegeneracy condition ( factorizability suffices ) it has the appropriate properties to give an invariant of compatibly framed three - manifolds .",
    "the quantum double of a finite - dimensional hopf algebra meets both conditions ( factorizable and unimodular ) , though it is often not ribbon , and we conjecture that the invariant of framed manifolds which we associate to the quantum double of @xmath19 is the framed invariant kuperberg associates by very different means to @xmath5 we also conjecture that the dijkgraaf and witten spin invariants of the previous section arise by a construction analogous to that of reshetikhin and turaev from a quasitriangular but not ribbon hopf algebra .",
    "i would like to thank j. baez , j. barrett , r. kirby , a. liakhovskaia , g. masbaum , e. witten and g. zuckermann for helpful conversations and suggestions .",
    "a framed link is an oriented link in oriented @xmath20 together with a nonzero section of the normal bundle , considered up to ambient isotopy .",
    "the framing or self - linking number of a component is the linking number between that component and a copy of it pushed off slightly in the direction of the framing .",
    "an _ even _ link is a framed link all of whose components have even self - linking number .",
    "a projection of a framed link ( in particular of an even framed link ) is a projection of any representative of the isotopy class onto the oriented plane ( the representative is first viewed as sitting inside @xmath21 ) such that the projection of the link is a smooth immersion of the union of circles with no self - intersections other than transverse double points , and the framing is never orthogonal to the projection .",
    "of course such a projection , together with identification of each crossing as over or under , uniquely determines the isomorphism class of the framed link",
    ". we will sometimes be interested in such projections which also come equipped with a _ height function , _",
    "i.e. , a smooth map from @xmath22 to @xmath23 without critical points such that when the map is restricted to the projection its critical points are nondegenerate and do not fall on the crossings .",
    "an isotopy of a framed link and a projection ( and of a height function ) is collectively called a _ planar isotopy _",
    "( respectively _ simple isotopy _ ) if at each point of the isotopy the link projection ( and height function ) satisfy the conditions of the previous paragraph .",
    "the winding number of a component of a projection is the total number of complete counterclockwise rotations the tangent vector to that component of the projection undergoes in a complete circuit around the component in the direction of its orientation .",
    "it is also half the total signed number of critical points of the height function , with those turning counterclockwise counting as @xmath24 and those turning clockwise counting as @xmath25    note that the winding number of a component of a projection and the framing of that projection are always of opposite parity ( i.e. one is odd , the other is even ) . to see this notice each changes parity only when the other does under the reidemeister moves ( see burde and zieschang @xcite ) , so",
    "if the claim is true for one projection of a link it is true for all projections of that link .",
    "it is certainly true for a component which is a framed unknot unlinked with the other components ( using the simple projection in which it participates in no crossings with other components and crosses with itself @xmath26 times where @xmath26 is the absolute value of the framing ) and it remains true when a single crossing in a projection is switched from over to under or under to over . since it is well known ( see adams @xcite , for example ) that one can get from any projection to a projection of unlinked unknots by a sequence of such crossing changes , the claim is true in all projections .",
    "[ pr : reidemeister ] every link admits a projection in which each component with even framing has winding number one and each component with odd framing has winding number zero .",
    "two such projections are of the same framed link if and only if they can be connected by planar isotopy together with the _ regular isotopy moves _ shown in figure [ fg : reidemeister ] ( understood to apply with any orientations on the pictured strands ) .",
    "two such projections equipped with height functions can be connected by simple isotopy together with the regular isotopy moves ( with the vertical indicating the height function ) and the _ height function moves _ in figure [ fg : height ] .",
    "@xmath27    @xmath28    recall every framed link admits a projection ( every link admits a projection according to @xcite , and by adding a suitable number of full twists to the projection one can make the projection have any given framing ) , so choose one such .",
    "notice the moves in figure [ fg : doubletwist ] do not change the framed link , but change the winding number of the indicated component by @xmath29 a sequence of such moves gives a projection in which every component has winding number one or zero , and the observation preceding the proposition indicates these components must have respectively even or odd framings .",
    "for the second claim , trace @xcite has shown that two link projections are regular isotopic ( i.e. , connected by a sequence of regular isotopy moves and planar isotopy ) , if and only if their links are isotopic and each component has the same writhe and winding number .",
    "the writhe of a component of a projection is the signed sum of the crossings of the component with itself , which is of course the framing if it is a projection of a framed link .    that every framed link admits a height function is clear , by choosing any real function with no critical points and perturbing slightly as necessary",
    "that two such are connected by a sequence of the height function moves appears in kassel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma x.3.5 ) .",
    "@xmath30    the appropriate moves for framed links without the restriction on winding number are the regular isotopy moves of figure [ fg : reidemeister ] together with a move that replaces a positive full twist with winding number @xmath24 with a positive full twist with winding number @xmath25 these are called the framed reidemeister moves @xcite . the regular isotopy moves are strictly weaker .",
    "in section 3 we will assign numbers to link projections with each component having winding number one , such that the numbers are unchanged by simple isotopy and the moves of regular isotopy , and thus are invariants of the even links the projections represent .",
    "recall that the ordinary chern - simons invariant depends not simply on a three - manifold but on a @xmath6-framed three - manifold .",
    "a @xmath6-framing of a three - manifold @xmath31 can either be defined as a trivialization up to isotopy of a @xmath32 bundle associated with @xmath33 or as a choice of cobordism class of four - manifolds which @xmath31 bounds @xcite .",
    "we will use the second definition , and recall that the cobordism class of a four - manifold is determined by its boundary and signature , so we may think of a @xmath6-framing on @xmath31 as an integer representing the signature of the four - manifold @xcite .    the choice of a spin structure ( recall every compact oriented three - manifold admits a spin structure , defined as a lifting up to isotopy of the @xmath17 bundle associated to @xmath34 to an @xmath35 bundle ) and a @xmath6-framing for @xmath31 is equivalent to the choice of a framing for @xmath31 , i.e. a trivialization of the tangent bundle up to isotopy .",
    "that is , if two framings induce the same spin structure and @xmath6-framing they are homotopic , and every combination of spin structure and @xmath6-framing is induced by some framing .    according to kirby (",
    "* chapters ii , iv , and vii ) every spin three - manifold spin bounds a spin four - manifold , in fact a @xmath6-handlebody ( i.e. , a four - manifold formed by attaching a collection of @xmath6-handles to a @xmath36-handle ) .",
    "a @xmath6-handlebody is spin if and only if its intersection form on second cohomology is even , and in this case possesses a unique spin structure .",
    "thus we may specify a spin structure on a three - manifold by specifying a @xmath6-handlebody with even form which the three - manifold bounds .",
    "now a @xmath6-framing on a three - manifold can also be determined by specifying a four - manifold which it bounds , in fact it is determined by the signature of the intersection form ( again , it may as well be a @xmath6-handlebody ) .",
    "it is natural to represent both pieces of information by a single four - manifold , but this is only possible for certain framings",
    ". recall ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter xi ) that if @xmath31 is a spin three - manifold then rohlin s invariant @xmath37 is an even integer modulo @xmath38 such that every four - manifold which spin bounds @xmath31 has signature equal to @xmath37 modulo @xmath10 motivated by this we define    a framing on a compact , connected , oriented three - manifold @xmath31 is called _ compatible _ if the induced @xmath6-framing as an integer is equal to @xmath39    thus a compatible framing on @xmath31 can be represented by a @xmath6-handlebody .",
    "recall from kirby ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter i ) that if @xmath40 is a @xmath6-handlebody , @xmath40 can be presented by an unoriented framed link in @xmath41 here @xmath20 bounds the @xmath36-handle @xmath42 and the link with each component thickened to a solid torus with distinguished longitude determines how to attach a @xmath6-handle along each component .",
    "the matrix of the intersection form is given by the linking matrix , which is even ( i.e. has even entries along the diagonal ) if and only if the @xmath6-handlebody is spin .",
    "the boundary of a four - manifold described by a link is the three - manifold obtained by surgery on that link .",
    "that is , it is the result of removing a tubular neighborhood of each component and gluing it back in by sending the meridian to the longitude and the longitude to minus the meridian .",
    "thus surgery on an even link can be viewed as resulting in not simply a three - manifold , but a three - manifold together with a compatible framing .",
    "the following theorem and proof are direct translations of kirby s well - known surgery theorem @xcite to the spin case .",
    "[ th : kirby ]    every three - manifold with a compatible framing can be presented by surgery on an even link .",
    "two such presentations determine the same framed three - manifold if and only if they can be connected by a sequence of the spin kirby moves pictured in figure [ fg : kirby ] . here",
    "move i is the usual handleslide or band connect sum of kirby s original theorem .",
    "every spin three - manifold can be presented by surgery on an even link , and two such determine the same spin three - manifold if and only if they can be connected by a sequence of spin kirby moves i and ii as above together with distant union with the link representing the kummer surface , pictured for example in @xcite .",
    "@xmath43    the first sentence is clear , as is the fact the the spin kirby moves do not change the framed three - manifolds .",
    "so suppose @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two spin @xmath6-handlebodies with the same spin boundary and signature presented by links @xmath46 and @xmath47 we will show that @xmath46 and @xmath48 can be connected by spin kirby moves .",

    "can be replaced by a new spin five - manifold in which there are no @xmath55-handles but the morse manifolds ( i.e. @xmath62 of noncritical values ) are the same .",
    "similarly we can replace all the @xmath63-handles with @xmath64-handles .",
    "arrange @xmath65 so that all @xmath6-handles have morse values less than those of all @xmath64-handles . because the morse manifolds are simply - connected , each @xmath6-handle as it is attached connect sums @xmath66 to the morse manifold , which corresponds to spin kirby move ii applied to @xmath67 likewise by flipping @xmath65 we see each @xmath64-handle corresponds to move ii applied to @xmath47 thus a sequence of moves ii applied to @xmath46 and @xmath48 gives links representing the same spin four - manifold with boundary @xmath68 kirby s argument that these can be connected by a sequence of moves i goes through unchanged .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath69 have the same spin three - manifold boundary , then their signature differs by a multiple of @xmath10 thus the union of one of their links with sufficiently many copies of the kummer surface link results in two links which present the same framed manifold , and part ( a ) of the theorem applies .",
    "the link invariants we construct will be multiplicative in the sense that the invariant of a distant union of links ( i.e. the union of two links embedded simultaneously in @xmath20 so that they are separated by an @xmath70 ) is the product of their individual invariants .",

    "if @xmath399 is in @xmath392 then @xmath400 is a distinct label with @xmath401 and @xmath402 for @xmath403 and we see that labeling the new unknot by @xmath399 versus @xmath400 contributes the same amount with opposite sign to the computation of the total invariant . thus labeling",

    "the invariant is defined precisely in analogy with the definition for ribbon categories ( in fact , if the quasitriangular hopf algebra is extended in the usual way of reshetikhin and turaev @xcite to a ribbon hopf algebra , the invariants agree on even links ) , and we will imitate the construction of @xcite closely .",
    "let @xmath79 be an even link with a quantum character @xmath459 associated to each component @xmath460 of @xmath101 choose a presentation of @xmath79 with every component having winding number one , and also with a height function .",

    "the number assigned to the component is @xmath466 of this product if the basepoint direction coincides with the orientation of the component and is @xmath466 of @xmath132 of the product if they are in opposite directions .",
    "the number assigned to the state is the product of the numbers assigned to the components , and finally the number assigned to the projection is the sum of over all states of the numbers assigned to the states .    given a state , or any decorated link diagram , it is possible to compute the number assigned to that state ` in stages . '",
    "specifically , a _ fragment _ of a link projection is the intersection of the projection with a disk whose boundary intersects the projection transversely and not at double points or critical points .",
    "choose for each strand of the fragment a basepoint ( several strands may belong to the same component of the entire link ) .",
    "now each decorated point in the fragment has associated to it an integer rotation relative to the basepoint of its strand .",
    "assign to each strand the product of @xmath467 where @xmath468 is a decoration , @xmath469 is the integer rotation number , and the product is over all decorations .",
    "the order of the product comes from traversing the strand in the basepoint direction , traveling from one endpoint to the other for open strands , and from the basepoint once around for closed strands .",
    "the key observation is that if we erase all decorations in the fragment and replace them with the chosen basepoints decorated with the assigned products as above , the number associated to the entire state is unchanged .    in particular ,",
    "notice that if we define the set of states of a fragment to be the set of all possible assignments of index values to the crossings in the fragment , then the set of states of the projection is the product of the set of states of the fragment and the set of states of its complement ( which is also a fragment ) .",
    "so the number associated to the entire projection , which is a sum over states , can be found by summing over all pairs of states a number computed by evaluating the state on the fragment and on its complement and combining appropriately .",
    "what s more , if a fragment of a projection is replaced with a perhaps topologically distinct fragment , but such that the strands connect the same pairs of boundary points , the rotation numbers of the boundary points from the basepoint are the same , and the sum of the decorations of the basepoints , viewed as an element of @xmath470 where @xmath26 is the number of open strands , is the same , then the projection with the replaced fragment will yield the same number as the original projection .",
    "the proof of the following proposition offers a concrete illustration of this observation , where it is the key to proving invariance under the regular isotopy moves .",
    "[ pr : invariance ] the number computed above depends neither on the specific projection nor on the choice of basepoints , but only on the even link and quantum characters .",
    "we call this invariant quantity @xmath471 or @xmath472 when the labels require explicit mention .    for invariance under choice of basepoint",
    ", it suffices to check the quantity is unchanged if one basepoint is moved past a crossing or a critical point .",
    "this fact is generally true for decorated projections and does not rely on special properties of the @xmath473-matrix .    to see that it is unchanged when a basepoint is moved past a crossing or any decorating hopf algebra element , consider for a given state and component , the product @xmath474 where @xmath475 is the last decoration encountered in the traversal about the component and @xmath476 is the product of the rest of the decorating elements with appropriate powers of @xmath477 the @xmath478 represents the integer rotation number of the point decorated by @xmath479 which because of the winding number condition on the projection is @xmath6 if the direction of traversal agrees with the orientation and @xmath480 if it disagrees . in either case",
    "the defining property of the quantum character gives @xmath481 so the computed quantity is the same as for the case where the base point is just below instead of just above the decorated point .    to see that it is unchanged when the base point is moved past a critical point , consider a base point",
    "at which the orientation of the component is upwards , which is to be moved past a minimum of the height function configured so that the orientation rotates clockwise around it ( the other cases all work similarly ) . viewing the rest of the link as a fragment with the fragment basepoint just above the basepoint for the component in the link and decorated by @xmath479",
    "the value of the decorated link projection before moving the basepoint is @xmath482 and after moving it is @xmath483      the first regular isotopy move reduces to the equation @xmath484 which is a restatement of equation ( [ eq : inverse ] ) .",
    "the second isotopy move is exactly the yang - baxter equation ( [ eq : yb ] ) .",
    "the height function moves are immediate from the definition .    in the presence of a ribbon structure",
    "the trace with respect to a representation @xmath126 of the hopf algebra can be made into a quantum character by adding the charmed element , @xmath485 the link invariant described in this section would then correspond to the usual reshetikhin and turaev link invariant associated to @xmath126 @xcite . for a nonsemisimple hopf algebra",
    "there are typically other quantum characters .",
    "but even in the absence of the ribbon structure , for every representation @xmath126 we can always choose an intertwiner from @xmath486 to the trivial representation ( if @xmath126 is irreducible , it is unique up to scale ) and viewing elements of the hopf algebra via the representation as elements of @xmath487 we get a functional on the hopf algebra which proves to be a quantum character .",
    "thus even in the merely quasitriangular situation representations give ( even ) link invariants .",
    "we expect that there is a categorical structure , analogous to but weaker than the notion of ribbon category , which axiomatizes the structure that allows the category of representations of such a hopf algebra to give even link invariants .",
    "it seems plausible that the quotient of a ribbon category containing odd degenerate objects by the full set of degenerate objects , which does not make sense as a ribbon category , would be well - defined as a category of this sort .",
    "we conjecture further that associated to the half - integer level chern - simons theories of the previous section there are quasitriangular but not ribbon hopf algebras such that an appropriate truncation of their representation theory ( corresponding to the truncated tensor product construction for ordinary quantum groups ) yields the spin chern - simons theories at those levels .",
    "1 .   @xmath488 where @xmath489 the distant union of the labeled links @xmath490 and @xmath491 is the link formed by embedding each into @xmath20 so that they are separated by a sphere .",
    "reversing the orientation of a component corresponds to composing the quantum character labeling that component with @xmath477        recall that a left ( respectively right ) integral in the dual of a hopf algebra @xmath19 is a functional @xmath492 such that @xmath493 ( respectively @xmath494 ) for all @xmath495 .",

    "* theorem 3 ) , @xmath496 for all @xmath497 so that @xmath91 is a quantum character . also by proposition 3 of the same article @xmath498",
    "so that ( assuming now that @xmath19 is quasitriangular and thus determines a link invariant as described in the previous subsection ) changing the orientation of a component labeled by @xmath91 does not change the invariant .    the integral @xmath91 enjoys a particularly distinctive property : it generates @xmath432 as a free @xmath19-module .",
    "more specifically , if we define for each @xmath499 the functional @xmath500 by @xmath501 for all @xmath502 then the map @xmath503 is one - to - one and onto . from this",

    "invariance under spin kirby move ii follows from the normalization of @xmath91 and property 1 of the list at the end of the previous subsection ( the invariant of the hopf link is @xmath511 ) .    before proving invariance under move i@xmath78 ,",
    "consider the fragment in figure [ fg : cable ] .",
    "by repeated application of equation ( [ eq : rcable ] ) we see that the sum over all states of the values assigned to the fragment is @xmath512 where the @xmath26 entries of the tensor product label the components from left to right at the bottom of the fragment .",
    "similarly , using equations ( [ eq : lcable ] ) and ( [ eq : rcable ] ) , we see that the same fragment with the opposite parity is associated to @xmath513 the mirror image of this fragment is associated to @xmath514 and the mirror image with opposite parity by @xmath515    with this in hand we see that the fragment on the left - hand side of figure [ fg : spinfr ] corresponds ( with the same convention of decorating the strands from left to right at the bottom of the picture ) to @xmath516 the last line by equation ( [ eq : trivial ] ) . of course , replacing each @xmath517 in the above computation by @xmath518 and every @xmath519 with @xmath520 we see that the right - hand side equals the same thing , and thus the two fragments are interchangeable in the calculation of the invariant .",
