    "recent discoveries on multiple stellar populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) have revealed that some of these old stellar systems show chemical inhomogeneities , not just in the light elements involved in the hot h - burning , but also in heavier elements and in the overall metallicity . to explain the large metallicity dispersion in @xmath2  centauri",
    "it has been suggested that this gc is the remnant of a dwarf galaxy disrupted through tidal interactions with the milky way , rather than a true gc ( e.g. norris et al.1996 ; bekki & freeman 2003 ; bekki & norris 2006 ) . in this scenario , @xmath2  centauri would be the dense nucleus of a dwarf galaxy , which was cannibalised by the milky way .",
    "the recent discoveries of more @xmath2  centauri - like gcs , with internal metallicity variations ( e.g. marino et al.2009 ; da costa et al.2009 ; 2014 ; yong et al.2014 ) , support the hypothesis that at least these `` anomalous '' gcs were as massive as small galaxies able of retaining fast supernovae ejecta .",
    "the relatively high fraction of metal - richer stars in these gcs also supports the idea that they were more massive .",
    "the possible gc - dwarf galaxy connection may have consequences for near - field cosmology and the hierarchical assembly of our galaxy .",
    "at least the gcs with internal variations in metallicity may contribute to the inventory of original satellites , along with existing dwarf spheroidals and ultra - faints , to alleviate the missing satellites problem of the @xmath3-cold dark matter scenario ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 1993 , klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the hypothesis that at least some gcs may constitute the surviving nuclei of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies implies that the milky way has stripped the less bound external stars from these systems during successive passages through the galactic potential , leaving only their compact nuclei .",
    "a snapshot of this phenomenon may be m54 , as it shows an intrinsic fe dispersion ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2008 , carretta et al . 2010 ) and lies at the centre of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy that is being tidally disrupted by the milky way ( ibata et al.1994 ) .",
    "while nearly all the galactic gcs have chemical variations in the light elements involved in the hot h - burning ( such as c , n , o , na , see e.g. , kraft 1994 ; gratton et al .",
    "2004 ) , only a few of them are known to possess spreads in fe and @xmath1-element abundances ( @xmath2  cen , m22 , ngc  1851 , m2 , ngc5824 , ngc3201 , e.g. , smith et al . 2000 ; marino et al .",

    "it is intriguing that the gcs with metallicity and @xmath1-element variations are generally the more massive ones .",
    "the complexity of the multiple stellar populations in these objects is puzzling and we do not have yet a coherent picture to explain the formation of their different generations of stars .    in this context ,",
    "ngc  1851 is one of the most intriguing targets .",
    "much effort has been dedicated to this gc after the discovery of a prominent bimodal sub - giant branch ( sgb , milone et al .",
    "the formation scenario for these two sgb components is still under debate .",
    "observational constraints for the sequence of events that led to the formation of these stellar groups can be inferred from their chemical compositions and their radial distributions in the cluster .",

    "interestingly , ngc1851 is surrounded by a diffuse stellar halo with a radius of more than 250 pc ( 67  from the cluster center ) and a mass of about 0.1% of the dynamical mass of ngc  1851 ( olszewski et al .",
    "the extension of this stellar structure is far beyond the tidal radius predicted by the king model ( king 1962 ) , that is the distance from the cluster center where cluster stars are expected to drastically disappear due to tidal interactions .",
    "the origin of this halo remains unknown , although various hypotheses exist .",
    "it could be the consequence of isolated cluster evaporation through tidal or disk shocking that may have originated a stellar tail .",
    "such processes are believed responsible for the streams observed in several gcs , such as pal5 ( odenkirchen et al .",

    "observations of ngc1851 are contradictory : while photometrically there is no evidence for tidal streams ( olszewski et al .",

    "( 2012 ) .",
    "alternatively , the huge halo of ngc1851 could have formed from the destruction of a dwarf galaxy in which the cluster may have once been embedded .",
    "bekki & yong ( 2012 ) outlined a possible self consistent and dynamically plausible scenario for the formation of ngc1851 s multiple populations and its stellar halo . in their scenario , two gcs in a dwarf galaxy merge ( owing to the low velocity dispersion of the host dwarf ) and form a new nuclear star cluster surrounded by field stars of the host dwarf .",
    "the host dwarf galaxy is stripped through tidal interaction with the milky way leaving the stellar nucleus which is observed as ngc1851 .",
    "thus , the two stellar populations in ngc  1851 originate in the two gcs that merged to form the nucleus .",
    "bekki & yong ( 2012 ) predict that ngc  1851 s stellar halo contains three stellar populations : two from the original gcs that merged to form the nucleus and the remaining population is from field stars surrounding stellar nuclei .    in the present study",
    "we investigate the nature of this intriguing stellar system , the gc ngc1851 plus its halo , by deriving radial velocities and , for the first time , chemical abundances for the halo stars .",
    "the chemical and dynamical properties of the halo stars will be compared with the ones observed within the tidal radius of the cluster .",
    "basic information for ngc1851 can be found in harris ( 1996 , 2010 edition , and references therein ) .",
    "its distance from the sun is @xmath012.1  kpc .",
    "the king tidal radius of ngc1851 was estimated to be 6.7  by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) , which is lower than the value of 11.7  in the previous harris compilation derived by trager et al.(1993 ) . given the large uncertainties related to the determination of the tidal radius , we assume in this work the conservative value of 11.7 .",
    "assuming the @xmath4 from harris ( 2010 edition ) and a typical @xmath5 , we get a mass of @xmath6 , which places ngc1851 among the most massive gcs .",

    "we used four distinct photometric data sets .",
    "first , we used stetson ( 2000 ) ground - based @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 photometry .",
    "this photometric catalog has been established from about 550 images taken at different telescopes , i.e. the max planck 2.2 m , the ctio 4 m , 1.5 m , and 0.9 m telescopes , and the dutch 0.9 m telescope in la silla .",
    "these data have been reduced by using procedures for the photometric and astrometric data reduction described by stetson(2005 ) , and have already been used in milone et al.(2009 ) .",

    "secondly , to study stars in the halo of ngc1851 , we collected @xmath15 images with wfi@2.2 m of a field between @xmath010  and 35  to the south of the cluster center .",

    "the wfc / acs photometry comes from go-10775 ( pi.a.sarajedini , see sarajedini et al.2007 and anderson et al.2008 ) and is presented in milone et al.(2008 ) .",

    "ground - based photometric data have been used to estimate atmospheric parameters , as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : atm ] .",
    "hence , it is important to have an estimate of the internal photometric uncertainties . according to the photometric catalogs from stetson(2000 ) , the average @xmath21(mag ) for a star with @xmath2219.5 in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 bands is @xmath00.003 , @xmath00.002 , @xmath00.012 , @xmath00.003 mag , respectively .",
    "since each star has been typically observed in tens of images , the formal error should be significantly smaller . in the external field we obtained @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 formal errors of @xmath00.005 , @xmath00.004 , @xmath00.006 mag , respectively .",
    "such small values are lower limits of the true photometric errors as demonstrated by the fact that the color spread of all the sequences of the cmds is significantly larger than few milli - magnitudes .",
    "photometry is indeed affected by a number of additional uncertainties .",
    "spatial variations of the photometric zero point along the field of view , introduced by small inaccuracy in the psf model , by the sky or bias determination , or by small reddening variations , are a very common property of any photometric catalog ( see anderson et al.2008 for a discussion on this issue ) . to estimate the error of target stars we started by measuring the color spread of ms stars as described in milone et al.(2009 , see their sect .",
    "briefly , we have verticalized the ms of ngc1851 by subtracting to the color of each star the color of the ms at the same @xmath10 magnitude , then we have determined the histogram distribution of the color difference ( @xmath23color ) , and , finally , we have fitted the histogram with a gaussian .",
    "we have repeated this procedure for @xmath18 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 colours .",
    "we assumed the @xmath21 of the least - squares best - fitting gaussian as our estimate of the color error .",
    "specifically , to estimate the errors associated to sgb stars in the central field , we used the color spread of ms stars with @xmath26 .",
    "we obtained @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we thus assumed 0.02 as typical magnitude uncertainty for stars in the internal field . in the case of stars in the external field , due to the small number of ms stars",

    "none of the ngc 1851 rv - like stars found outside the tidal radius shows a [ fe / h ] content different from the range observed in the inner field ; * the halo stars for which we could estimate abundances for sr and ba show abundances consistent with those observed on the bsgb , i.e. , they have lower sr and ba compared with those of the fsgb ; * our sample does not exhibit any strong evidence for the presence of stars with @xmath1-element abundances compatible with the fsgb .    within the multiple stellar population context ,",
    "qualitatively , our observations are in agreement with a scenario in which : _ ( i ) _ the first stellar population of ngc1851 is made up of @xmath1-poor ( bsgb ) stars ; _ ( ii ) _ the second generation is expected to form in the central region of the cluster possibly enriched in @xmath1-elements ; _ ( iii ) _ while the less radially concentrated first generation is lost early in the cluster evolution due to the expansion and stripping of the cluster outer layers resulting from early mass loss associated with first generation supernova ejecta ( e.g. , dercole et al.2008 ) .",
    "if this scenario is correct , our observations constitute the first clear evidence that gcs lose primarily first - generation stars by evaporation mechanisms",
    ". the chemical composition of field stars in the halo , that is consistent with the first - generation stars in gcs , may mainly be due to the evaporation of first - generation gc stars into the field .",
    "although the central relaxation time of ngc1851 is small ( of the order of @xmath76 yr ) , in the halo any dynamical time will be very long due to the low density .",
    "so , while in the central part of the cluster the timescales are short enough that the population is mixed , in the external halo field , they are sufficiently long such that any initial gradient may have been preserved .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the cmds shown by milone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) there is no obvious difference in the radial distributions of the bsgb and fsgb of ngc1851 up to @xmath08@xmath61 from the center .",
    "however , their observations are limited to a small region well within the tidal radius of the cluster , and we can not exclude different radial gradients at more external regions . if the fsgb is more centrally concentrated and the outer parts of the cluster are dominated by the bsgb , then since outer stars are more easily lost , that would be consistent with the bsgb dominance in the halo .",
    "we recall here that both the @xmath1-poor , and possibly also the @xmath1-rich groups in ngc1851 show internal variations in light elements ( e.g. , c , n , o , na ) .",
    "the presence of sub - populations within each main @xmath1-group makes the scenario more complex , challenging the identification of the sequence of the various stellar bursts that gave origin to the multiple stellar populations in this gc .",
    "an exhaustive study of the radial distributions of the ngc1851 stellar groups should account also for the presence of these sub - populations .",
    "the main question here is : why does ngc1851 possess a stellar halo with these kinematic and chemical properties ? in principle the presence of a halo may be simply consistent with a stellar system that is losing its external stars into the field . on the other hand , gcs are expected to follow a king profile , with the surface density drastically dropping at the tidal radius .",
    "it has been well established that while king models succeed in describing the internal stellar surface - brightness profiles , they often fail in the outer regions of clusters , including the milky way gcs ( e.g. , mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 ; carballo - bello et al .",
    "gcs surface - brightness profiles suggest that stellar clusters do not simply truncate on the king tidal radius , but have low density extended halos .",
    "all gcs should be stressed , to different extent , by interactions with the host galaxy .",
    "hence , deviations from the king profile could not be surprising .",
    "mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) have shown that the observed surface - brightness profiles of gcs is generally better reproduced by a modified isothermal sphere based on an _ ad hoc _ stellar distribution function developed for elliptical galaxies by wilson ( 1975 ) .",
    "the corresponding wilson tidal radius of mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) is larger than that derived assuming a king profile , being @xmath045  for ngc1851 .",
    "however , although we can formally fit the surface - brightness profiles of gcs in the regions beyond the king radius adopting _ ad hoc _ analytical templates , in many cases it remains unclear why we observe such halo envelopes . for ngc1851 the main question",
    "could hence not be why it possess a halo , but why it shows such a peculiarly uniform halo , without evident tidal features in the large photometric field analysed by olszweski et al.(2009 ) .",
    "the ngc1851 halo may be a more interesting case , as it extends for 67  from the cluster center , that is much farther than any estimate for its tidal radius present in the literature .",
    "its very low density , as determined in olswzeski et al . , would make it easily perturbed by passages through the disk . according to dinescu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , ngc1851 is at a distance from the galactic center of 16.0  kpc , its orbit has apogalacticon and perigalacticon distances of @xmath030  kpc and @xmath05  kpc , respectively , a high eccentricity of @xmath00.7 , and passes through the disk of the milky way five times per gyr .",
    "hence , it seems unlikely that an outer envelope of stars remains attached to the cluster for a hubble time or , alternatively , that the cluster could shed sufficient stars to make such a huge envelope in half an orbit .",
    "our spectroscopic sample of stars does not show any evidence of tidal streams . although our observations allow us to draw this conclusion only for a relatively small region of the halo , olswzeski et al .",
    "did not find any evidence for tidal streams in their large field of view .",
    "this apparent lack of streams in the olswzeski et al .",
    "analysis is puzzling .",
    "it is difficult to envisage a scenario that assumes that such an extended low - density halo is bound to ngc1851 , if the cluster has been in orbit around the milky way for a significant portion of a hubble time .",
    "however , even if it seems unlikely , we can not exclude that , if the cluster has been in orbit around the galaxy for a long time , we are seeing a particular phase of the ngc1851 evolution : e.g. , a very extended envelope of stars that is in the process of escaping from the cluster , but still bound to it .",
    "ngc1851 is currently at an intermediate distance from the galactic center between the apogalacton and perigalacticon , and it is at a distance of 7.1  kpc from the galactic plane ( djorgovski 1993 ) , that is around the maximum distance from the plane allowed by its orbit ( dinescu et al.1999 ) .",
    "the halo may have formed after the last passage through the disk , and will then be largely swept away next time the cluster crosses the disk and , presumably , recreated as the cluster moves through the halo in the half - orbit time before the next disk crossing .",
    "future dynamical simulations may be enlightening in this regard , and should prove if such a scenario is plausible for the formation of the ngc1851 halo .",
    "alternatively , it is tempting to speculate that we really are seeing a system that has been captured relatively recently and the envelope does represent the former dwarf galaxy . in this case , there just have not been enough orbits yet for the envelope to be completely stripped off by passages through the disk .",
    "hence it is possible that the halo population could look like the first generation in the cluster in the same way that the first generation in most globular clusters looks like the field halo population at the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then we would expect that the halo population does not host stars enriched in na because dwarf galaxies do not show na - o anticorrelations .    the first cluster proposed to be the nucleus of a dwarf tidally disrupted through milky way interactions was @xmath2  centauri ( norris et al .",
    "assuming a similar scenario , it would be less problematic to understand the large chemical variations , also in heavy elements , displayed by this cluster ( e.g. , norris & da costa 1995 ; johnson & pilachowski 2010 ; marino et al .",
    "although less pronounced , ngc1851 shows chemical and photometric peculiarities similar to those of @xmath2  centauri ( e.g. , milone et al .",
    "2008 ; yong & grundahl 2008 ; villanova et al .  2010 ; carretta et al .",
    "in contrast to ngc1851 , for the case of @xmath2  centauri there is no evidence for stellar halo envelopes , probably because its location relatively close the galactic centre and its tightly bound orbit .",
    "these ensure that galactic tidal forces at its location are relatively strong so that any loosely bound population is quickly removed preventing the survival of any such structure to the present - day ( see da costa & coleman 2008 ) .",
    "if the accretion of @xmath2  centauri has not occurred recently there has been time to remove the loosely bound outer envelope that could have originally surrounded the cluster . on the other hand , m54 , that is the gc associated with the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , preserves an external envelope , that is the field population of the sagittarius .",
    "collectively , these facts may reinforce the conjecture that _ anomalous _ gcs could represent the surviving nuclei of dwarf galaxies disrupted by tidal interactions with the milky way , and we can speculate that the halo surrounding ngc1851 is the remnant of the parent dwarf galaxy .    to test the feasibility of this hypothesis , dynamical simulations taking into account the tidal interactions between the milky way and dwarfs are fundamental .",
    "recent simulations presented in bekki & yong ( 2012 ) show that the halo in ngc1851 can be reproduced if this object formed in a dwarf galaxy environment , through the merger of two clusters ( corresponding to the @xmath1-rich and @xmath1-poor groups ) that sink into the center of the host galaxy . from their simulations",
    ", they expect to have three stellar populations in the halo : the @xmath1-poor and the @xmath1-rich stars , plus a third population representing the field of the host dwarf .",
    "our results seem to not strongly favour this idea . assuming that each of the three populations should be equally represented in the halo , we have not found any clear evidence for the presence of either the @xmath1-rich stars or a third population differing from the metal distribution observed in ngc1851 to be associated with a field population from the host galaxy .",
    "if , following the bekki scenario , we assume that the three populations are equally represented ( e.g. , fsgb=33% ; bsgb=33% , and field=33% ) , the probability to not observe any star with the ba and sr abundances of the fsgb population of ngc1851 , even if not null , is low ( see sect .",
    "this suggests that , even with our modest statistics , it is unlikely that there are three populations equally represented in the field , as in the bekki & yong scenario .",
    "furthermore , even if an internal metallicity variation of the order of 0.10  dex in the halo ( that we can not see because of observational errors ) can not be ruled out , the metal distribution of the external field ( 15 stars ) is very similar to that observed within the tidal radius .",
    "this favours the idea that the halo does not host stellar populations with metallicities too distinctive with respect to ngc1851 , but we can not completely exclude that the lack of such stars is instead introduced by photometric selection effects that can affect our sample .",
    "we note that olswzeski et al .  found evidence for the presence of at least the two sgb populations ( bsgb and fsgb ) in the cmd of the ngc1851 halo .",
    "however , it is possible that their fsgb may not correspond to the one observed in the cluster ; given they found a significantly larger separation between the two sgbs than that found out to 8  from the cluster center ( milone et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "as previously discussed , the halo population we are actually observing could be either the @xmath1-poor population observed in the cluster or the field population of the host galaxy , that may show the same metallicity and chemical properties of the cluster bsgb .",
    "in the latter case , we do nt have to see bekki & yong s postulated 3rd population , as it may be the same as the cluster first generation and we may have to look at a lot of halo stars to see a different [ fe / h ] distribution from that of the cluster first generation .",
    "it is also worth noting that the dynamical simulations by bekki & yong assume ngc1851 is the result of a merger between two clusters",
    ". it might be interesting to see if similar simulations assuming the ngc1851 various groups formed in a self - pollution scenario are able to better reproduce the observations .",
    "the lack of a drop in the velocity dispersion profile is another piece of evidence that makes ngc1851 hardly compatible with the king model .",
    "a similar lack is intriguingly seen in m54 , the gc lying at the center of sagittarius .",
    "this gc shows a velocity dispersion profile that falls off with the distance from the cluster center , and increases outside , due to either contamination from sagittarius in the external part of the cluster or to tidal harassment from the host galaxy ( bellazzini et al.2008 ) . in the hypothesis that the ngc1851 halo represents the parent galaxy population",
    ", we would qualitatively expect a relatively high velocity dispersion for the halo . on the other hand ,",
    "if the halo is simply formed by stars evaporating from ngc1851 , it may be that the stars in the region outside the tidal radius are undergoing some kind of heating , due to either tides and/or unseen ( dark ) matter or modified newtonian dynamics ?",
    "we are not able to answer this question here .",
    "we only note that , according to dynamical simulations presented in kpper et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the velocity dispersion of unbound escaping stars outside gc tidal radii should significantly increase and flattening due to tidal interactions with the milky way .",
    "the orbit of ngc1851 suggests that it is not at its perigalacticon and it is at its largest distance from the galactic plane , but according to kpper et al .",
    "this effect , even if magnified at the perigalacticon , seems to be present at any location on the orbit .",
    "we note however that our sample of 23 stars outside the tidal radius may still be bound to the cluster .",
    "future investigations on the velocity dispersions in the halo of ngc1851 may give information on the nature of the ngc1851+halo system , assuming that measurements will be available at different radial locations in the halo and with better statistics .",
    "we conclude that the presence of such an extended halo in ngc1851 may suggest that the complex chemical enrichment in this gc has taken place in a dwarf whose nucleus is ngc1851 .",
    "interestingly , the location of ngc1851 coincides with the disk of satellites , a relatively thin , highly inclined plane defined by the distribution of luminous milky way satellite galaxies ( kroupa et al.2005 ; metz et al.2007 ; pawlowski et al.2012 ; pawlowski & kroupa2013 ) . it would be interesting in the future to see whether ngc1851 is co - orbiting with this structure or not .",
    "it is conceivable that ngc1851 s host galaxy was tidally disrupted by the collision and its stars were dispersed into the milky way halo in a similar way as what we observe with m54 and the sagittarius dwarf today .",
    "the ultra low density halo of ngc1851 could therefore be the last trace of its ancient host .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis provides , for the first time , chemical abundances from low resolution data and the identification of two low rgb halo stars lying on the fiducial of ngc1851 , that may be useful to follow - up at higher resolution .",
    "the present analysis is confined to a relatively small sample , that does not show strong evidence for @xmath1-enrichment .",
    "we stress however that in the future , we need to extend this analysis to larger fields to increase the statistics and possibly confirm the lack / deficiency of fsgb stars in the halo that result from the present study .",
