    "the diffuse neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) is known to exist in two flavors : the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "traditionally , the cnm and wnm are understood as being two thermal equilibrium states of the neutral ism with temperature of @xmath5 k and @xmath6 k @xcite .",
    "in addition , for the cnm the spin temperature , @xmath7 is expected from theoretical considerations .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the case of the wnm and @xmath8 could be lower than @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "observationally , the cnm is easily studied with the 21-cm line absorption .",
    "while the cnm properties have been measured extensively , only three direct measurements of the wnm spin temperature exist to date @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this observational paucity is the low optical depth of the wnm , @xmath10 , which creates a need for very sensitive radio instruments .",
    "properties of the wnm are traditionally indirectly inferred only through hi emission line profiles .",
    "out of all ism phases , the wnm is the least understood ; yet it seems to hold the key for constraining ism models and the formation of cnm clouds .",
    "the theoretical and numerical models of the ism take into account heating and cooling processes and try to reproduce the observed physical properties of the cnm and the wnm .",
    "these properties include temperature distribution , column density probability density functions ( pdfs ) , the gas fraction in each phase , and even profiles of emission and absorption spectra .",
    "@xcite , and similarly @xcite , predict that most of the wnm , which in their model envelopes the cnm , should be in thermal equilibrium and comprise only about 4% of the total column density .",
    "however , observers have traditionally found a much higher fraction for the wnm .",
    "in addition , a significant fraction of the wnm could be thermally unstable . using a statistically meaningful sample and",
    "the arecibo radio telescope , heiles & troland ( 2003 ; ht03 ) found that 48% of the wnm in their survey was in the thermally unstable phase , with kinetic temperatures in the range of 500 @xmath11 5000 k. the ht03 results question the meaning of a two - phase neutral medium and have triggered substantial numerical studies .",
    "numerical models of the ism which include turbulence easily find thermally unstable gas and lead to the conclusion that dynamical processes overshadow the microscopic ones in determining gas temperature .",
    "macroscopical processes are hard to calculate theoretically because they depend on many forms of energy input ( ht03 ) . as a result ,",
    "the predicted column density fraction of the thermally unstable gas varies wildly ; from very large values strongly dependent on the sn rate , as in @xcite , to @xmath12% in @xcite .",
    "[ tab : obs ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     0.1 in @xmath13  @xmath14  n(hi)@xmath15 was derived assuming @xmath16=100 k and fwhm=3 km s@xmath17 .",
    "+ @xmath13  @xmath18   the total hi column density was provided by ht03 and mohan et al .",
    "+ 0.1 in    as mentioned in the previous section , we detected three wide absorption features in the direction of j0022 + 002 , p0347 + 05 and 3c273 , with a velocity fwhm of 7 - 8 km s@xmath17 , and corresponding t@xmath19 of 1100 - 1400 k. for two of these sources , our best - fit solution resulted in @xmath20 400 k. these temperatures lie above the temperature range theoretically allowed for the cnm ( wolfire et al 2003 ) and therefore signify the presence of thermally unstable wnm gas with a temperature @xmath21 k @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that these broad absorption features represent a blending of several narrow cnm absorption components .",
    "our current velocity resolution of 1.6 km s@xmath17 does not allow us to dismiss this possibility .",
    "future evla observations with the widar correlator will yeild a higher velocity resolution and will allow us to address this question .",
    "the majority of detected absorption lines ( 8 out of 11 ) in this study have a velocity fwhm @xmath22 km s@xmath17 and the corresponding t@xmath23 500 k. while the 3-@xmath24 sensitivity of our observations was good enough to detect a typical wnm ( @xmath25 @xmath26 , ht03 ) in absorption with t@xmath273000 k and a fwhm @xmath28 km s@xmath17 , only two broad wnm components were detected .",
    "both of these detections have a fwhm @xmath29 km s@xmath17 and t@xmath301000 k. this could be an indication that the wnm with a temperature @xmath31 k is not as abundant as indicated previously by indirect observations ( e.g. ht03 ) .",
    "in addition , as we clearly demonstrated in the case of p0347 , the detection of weak hi absorption lines can decrease the number of thermally unstable wnm components .",
    "for the five sources with evla hi absorption detections , previous emission / absorption surveys ( ht03 and @xcite ) found seven thermally unstable wnm components .",
    "our best - fit solutions resulted in five thermally unstable components ( three seen in emission and two in absorption ) .",
    "if applied globally , this would decrease the fraction of thermally unstable wnm components from ht03 s @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "we note , however , that our conclusion is based on a small number statistics and that larger and more sensitive emission / absorption surveys are required to determine the fraction of the thermally unstable wnm in a statistically significant manner .    in several cases ( e.g. 3c286 and 3c263.1 ) we detected absorption lines which have a low optical depth and a narrow line - width which result in a low cnm column density n(hi)@xmath34 @xmath26 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the column density of typical cnm clouds , n@xmath35",
    "@xmath26 @xcite , and is close to the lowest theoretical expectations for the cnm @xcite .",
    "in addition , in these directions the cnm comprises only @xmath364% of the total hi column density .",
    "sources without detected hi absorption also suggest a very low cnm fraction ( table  [ tab : nodetect ] ) .",
    "this suggests , as also pointed out by stanimirovic , heiles , & kanekar ( 2007 ) , that the low column density cnm population may be quite abundant in the ism .",
    "while such small column densities and cnm fractions are hard to explain by thermal equilibrium ism models , they may be illuminating the tail - end of the cnm population produced by dynamic and turbulent ism processes .",
    "in order to access the feasibility of sensitive hi absorption observations with the evla , we observed a sample of 12 continuum sources , primarily along the lines of sight which have indicated the existence of the thermally - unstable wnm ( t@xmath37 5000 k ) in previous emission / absorption surveys @xcite .",
    "the results from this pilot study are as follows .",
    "@xmath38 for all , except three sources in our sample , we could achieve the expected optical depth sensitivity of @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining three sources were resolved with the evla ; yielding a much lower peak flux density , hence an optical depth sensitivity @xmath40 times higher than the expected value .",
    "@xmath38 out of 12 sources observed with the evla , we detected hi absorption in the direction of 5 sources ; a detection rate of @xmath042 % for our experiment .",
    "seven new absorption features , previously undetected in the emission / absorption surveys of heiles & troland ( 2003 ) and @xcite , were detected in the direction of these 5 sources .",
    "@xmath38 in the case of several sources e.g. 3c273 , p0347 + 05 and j0022 + 002 , we detected wide hi absorption lines ( fwhm @xmath41 km s@xmath17 ) resulting in t@xmath42 k. these lines likely trace the thermally unstable wnm seen in absorption .",
    "@xmath38 several detected absorption features have a peak optical depth of only a @xmath0 few @xmath43 and trace the tail - end of the cnm population .",
    "as we demonstrated , these weak hi absorption lines play an important role in estimating temperature of the wnm and can decrease the indirectly suggested fraction of the thermally unstable wnm .",
