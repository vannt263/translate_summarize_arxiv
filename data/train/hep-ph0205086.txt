    "in recent years there has been growing interest in the polarized photon structure functions .",
    "especially the first moment of a photon structure function @xmath0 has attracted much attention in connection with the axial anomaly which is also relevant in the nucleon spin structure function @xmath4 .",
    "the polarized structure function @xmath0 could be experimentally studied in the polarized version of ep collider hera,@xcite or more directly measured by the polarized e@xmath2e@xmath3 collision in the future linear collider . and",
    "the next - to - leading order qcd analysis of @xmath0 has been recently performed in the literature.@xcite    now there exists another structure function @xmath1 for the virtual photon target , where the twist-3 effect is also relevant in addition to the usual twist-2 effect . in this talk , we investigate the twist-3 effects in @xmath1 , to the leading order in qcd , and show that it is a sizable effect in contrast to the nucleon case,@xcite where it appears to be small in the experimental data.@xcite",
    "let us consider the polarized deep inelastic scattering on a polarized virtual photon target and study the virtual photon structure functions for the kinematical region : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the mass squared of the probe ( target ) photon , and @xmath9 is the qcd scale parameter .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the structure tensor , @xmath10 for the target ( probe ) photon with momentum @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , relevant for the polarized structure , can be written in terms of the structure functions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as @xcite @xmath13 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we note that we have the structure function @xmath1 only for non - zero @xmath14 , i.e. virtual photon .",
    "now we decompose @xmath15 into twist-2 and twist-3 contributions : @xmath16 where @xmath17 can be written by using wandzura - wilczek relation:@xcite @xmath18    experimental data for the nucleon show @xmath19 , and now we ask what about the photon structure , especially virtual photon case ?",
    "first we consider the operator product expansion ( ope ) relevant for the photon structure functions .",
    "the ope sandwitched between the photon states can be decomposed into the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions as follows : @xmath20}|\\gamma(p , s)\\rangle \\qquad \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sim \\sum_{n } e_n^{(2)}(q^2 ) \\langle\\gamma(p , s)|r_n^{(2)}|\\gamma(p , s)\\rangle + \\sum_{n } e_n^{(3)}(q^2 ) \\langle\\gamma(p , s)|r_n^{(3)}|\\gamma(p , s)\\rangle.\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the twist-2 and twist-3 operators , respectively .",
    "for the nucleon the matrix element : @xmath23 is small .",
    "now we calculate the virtual photon structure functions arising from the so - called box diagram , with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 being the number of active flavors .",
    "it turns out that the twist-3 contribution to @xmath1 is actually non - vanishing :     ( dashed ) , @xmath5 ( solid ) and @xmath26 ( dash-2dotted ) for @xmath27 gev@xmath28 and @xmath29 gev@xmath28 for @xmath30.,height=453 ]    we have plotted the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 for the virtual photon target , where @xmath27 gev@xmath28 and @xmath29 gev@xmath28 for @xmath30 in fig.1 .",
    "now the @xmath33-th moment of the twist-3 part @xmath34reads @xmath35 in the leading logarithmic order ( lo ) in qcd , where @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 representing the mixing of the twist-3 hadronic operators and @xmath38 describing the mixing between twist-3 hadronic and photonic operators .",
    "thus , the flavor non - singlet ( ns ) part reads @xmath39 in the large @xmath40 limit ( @xmath41 ) we have the 1-loop anomalous dimension of the ns twist-3",
    "operator:@xcite @xmath42 up to @xmath43 .",
    "we have plotted in fig.2 the above result to lo in qcd for the flavor non - singlet part .",
    "we expect the similar behavior for the flavor - singlet contribution .     for @xmath27 gev@xmath28 and @xmath29 gev@xmath28 for @xmath30.,height=453 ]",
    "we have investigated the twist-3 effect in @xmath1 for the virtual photon target , in the lo qcd and have found it gives rise to a sizable effect .",
