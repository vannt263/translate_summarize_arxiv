    "our rudimentary understanding of the gev @xmath0-ray sky was greatly advanced in 1991 with the launch of the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "the science returns from egret observations have exceeded pre - launch expectations , increasing the number of known @xmath0-ray sources from 12 dozen to the 271 listed in the third egret ( 3eg ) catalog  @xcite .",
    "however , of this multitude of sources , only about half have been _ definitively _ associated with known astrophysical objects .",
    "one reason so few sources have been uniquely identified is due to a typical location uncertainty of up to @xmath2 for an egret detected gamma - ray source , an area typically containing several potential candidate astrophysical objects . consequently most of the @xmath0-ray sky , as we currently understand it , consists of unidentified sources .",
    "the egret sources appear to arise from several distinct populations .",
    "there is an almost isotropic distribution of @xmath3 low / high variability objects , nearly all of which have now been plausibly associated with flaring blazars , a radio bright sub - class of active galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the remaining sources are believed to be within the milky way , and there is some speculation that they may comprise two distinct classes .",
    "the first class consists of bright sources with generally hard spectra with galactic latitude @xmath4 of the galactic plane , and are thought to be bright objects up to aproximately 10 kpc away .",
    "there is some evidence of a second population at mid - galactic latitudes ( @xmath1 ) consisting of fainter objects with generally steeper spectra .",
    "it has been hypothesized that this population is associated with the gould belt  @xcite , an asymmetric structure in a great circle on the sky tilted @xmath5 to the galactic plane .",
    "the gould belt comprises massive o and b stars as well as clusters of molecular clouds and expanding interstellar gas at distance of around 200 pc from earth .",
    "the observation of spatial coincidence  @xcite of low - latitude ( @xmath6 ) egret sources with massive ob stars and supernova remnants provides additional indication that the mid - latitude sources originate in the gould belt .",
    "figure  [ egret_intensity ] shows the intensity map of egret sources .",
    "though the correlation with the galactic plane is obvious , the hypthosized gould belt population is not easy to extract using an eyeball fit . in this communication",
    ", we apply a power spectrum analysis  @xcite in an attempt to tease this component out of the bright galactic plane sources .     +     two - dimensional egret detectability map for @xmath0-ray sources ( in units of @xmath7 s ) . ]",
    "+     two - dimensional egret detectability map for @xmath0-ray sources ( in units of @xmath7 s ) . ]",
    "for @xmath8  mev , the significance for a detection of an isolated point source with egret scales as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flux , @xmath11 is the exposure , and @xmath12 is the intensity of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission at the region of the source  @xcite .",
    "following  @xcite , we derive the detectability map considering these three ingredients in turn .",
    "first , the populations used in the monte carlo simulations are prepared such that they reproduce the observed distribution of the number of sources per flux bin , globally as well as locally .",
    "second , it is necessary to account for the highly non - uniform exposure of the instrument .",
    "thirdly , the diffuse @xmath0-ray background is compensated using the egret diffuse model , corresponding to the commonly believed cosmic ray / gas distribution coupling ( dynamic balance ) .    with these considerations in mind",
    ", we construct the egret detectability map by determining 95% cl limits for a grid on the sky .",
    "we determine the limits using the so - called p1234 time span  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , we request that the maximally significant measurement of the egret source has been obtained in the p1234 joint viewing period .",
    "this tends to eliminate flaring sources from our sample .",
    "the map is shown in figure  [ egret_exposure ] . to obtain the detectability weights we normalize each angular bin to unity .",
    "the spherical harmonics form a useful set for expansions of the intensity over the celestial sphere . for a uniform sky coverage , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a unit vector that denotes the direction in the sky of each source in the survey .",
    ", if @xmath15 , @xmath16 , if @xmath17 , and @xmath18 if @xmath19 to account for the nonuniform egret exposure , we define a weighted intensity @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the relative detectability at sky direction @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the sum of the weights @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the number of sources . since the eigenvalues of the @xmath26 expansion are uniquely defined @xmath27 the replacement of eq .",

    "the power in mode @xmath31 is sensitive to variation over angular scales of @xmath32 radians .",
    "if the steady egret sources in fact originate from two overlapping great circles associated with the galactic plane and the gould belt , one would expect a strong signal in the quadrupole ( @xmath33 ) moment describing the main component , and a fainter signal in the octopole ( @xmath34 ) moment indicating the spread from a perfect quadrupole .",
    "note that the gould belt is tilted 20@xmath35 relative to the galactic plane , so one would expect its presence to be mainifest in the octopole term which is sensitive to angular scales of about 15@xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath36 the expectation for an isotropic distribution observed with uniform exposure is @xmath37 and the rms fluctuations are  @xcite @xmath38 figure  [ cl_hist ] shows a comparison of the distributions of angular power spectra for isotropically distributed sources observed with uniform exposure ( @xmath39 ) and with the egret exposure ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "it can be seen that for the four multipole moments of interest , the spread of the distributions corresponding to uniform and non - uniform exposures are similar .",
