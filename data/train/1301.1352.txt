    "in january 1993 @xcite detected microwave radiation from the nearby solar - type dwarf @xmath0  for .",
    "its source was located @xmath1 south of the star . at that time",
    "it was already known that @xmath0  for is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "so , the authors suggested that the radio emission comes from the secondary companion , presumably a low - mass flaring dwarf . as we show below ,",
    "the secondary is in fact a tight pair of m dwarfs . despite the old age of this triple system ( 4 to 6  gyr ) , fast axial rotation of the m - dwarfs ( hence high activity ) is maintained by synchronization with the orbit .",

    "satellite detected a large acceleration of 19.4mas  yr@xmath4 presumably caused by the invisible ( astrometric ) companion @xcite .",
    "@xcite collected historical astrometric data spanning half a century and suggested that the orbital period is around 26.5yr .",
    "later @xcite published the elements of the astrometric orbit with this period and with a relatively large semi - major axis of @xmath5 , noting that the `` dark companion '' is massive .",
    "radial velocity ( rv ) of @xmath0  for was monitored both at lick and at la silla in search of planetary companions .",
    "none was found so far , but the rv trend caused by the stellar companion was obvious .",
    "@xcite noted the trend , while @xcite published a preliminary spectroscopic orbit with a 21yr period .",
    "@xcite added their own observations and revised the orbit slightly , although the full orbital cycle was not yet covered .",
    "neither of these publications mentions the astrometric results .",
    "the astrometric and spectroscopic companion was first resolved by @xcite in 2005 and , independently , by @xcite in 2007 .",
    "for this reason it received two confusing `` discoverer '' codes laf  27 and tok  40 in the washington double star catalog @xcite .  for ] by using all resolved measures and fixing the orbital period and eccentricity to those of the gontcharov s orbit , @xcite computed the first visual orbit of grade 4 . here",
    "we add new observations and derive the combined interferometric / spectroscopic orbit which agrees with the astrometric orbit .",
    "simbad lists 187 references to date and provides basic data on the primary companion , such as spectral type g1v , magnitudes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and near - solar metallicity ( see the full compilation of stellar parameter measurements in * ? ? ?",
    "the star is located above the main sequence in the @xmath9 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , being obviously evolved .",

    "spitzer _ and found to have no debris disk @xcite .",
    "yet , @xcite claimed recently that @xmath0  for is young and belongs to the ic  2391 moving group . in calculating the kinematic parameters they overlooked the companion and used the _ hipparcos _ proper motion ( pm ) , biased by the orbit .",
    "we calculate the heliocentric galactic velocity components of @xmath0  for from the center - of - mass pm @xcite and the new @xmath10-velocity to be @xmath11    =     [ -19.5 ,    -16.2 ,    -9.6]$]km  s@xmath12 ( @xmath13 is positive towards the galactic center ) .    in section  2 we derive the updated orbit of the outer system ab .",
    "then in section  3 we evaluate the parameters of the companions and show that the secondary b is over - massive , being itself a close binary .",
    "this hypothesis is confirmed in section  4 by direct spectroscopic detection of ba and bb . in the last section  5",
    "we discuss the implications of this finding for multiplicity statistics and exo - planet searches .",

    "the elements are listed in table  [ tab : orbits ] together with the previously published orbits .",
    "we have not used the astrometric data of @xcite , so the good match between spectro - interferometric and astrometric orbits speaks to their veracity .",
    "this is not the case of spectroscopic orbits which have a too short period .",
    "@xcite mention that they used `` some older measures '' in the orbit derivation but do not specify their source . in the future , with better rv and positional coverage , the elements will be determined to a much higher precision than here , but they will no longer be revised beyond the stated errors . the new orbit and",

    "september 2 ( 2012.6706 ) the binary was resolved with the nici adaptive optics instrument @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] . as the primary companion was heavily saturated , the position measurement ( @xmath29 , 0342 ) is not very accurate ( it is not included in table  [ tab : speckle ] ) , and no relative photometry could be made .",
    "however , the flux from the well - resolved companion b ( after halo subtraction ) was estimated by comparing it to stars hip  8674 and hip  12425 observed before and after this target at nearly the same airmass . the @xmath27 and @xmath30 magnitudes of those two stars from 2mass were used to determine the zero point ( the actual wavelength of the narrow - band filters was 1.587@xmath26 m and 2.272@xmath26 m ) . in this way we obtained crude estimates of the companion s infrared magnitudes @xmath31  mag and @xmath32  mag .",

    "this discrepancy is caused by the binary nature of b.    large total mass of the companion b follows from the orbital parameters .",
    "motion of the photo - center is characterized by the semi - major axis @xmath39 of the astrometric orbit .",
    "its ratio to the semi - major axis @xmath40 of the visual orbit is related to the mass ratio @xmath41 and to the light ratio @xmath42 as @xmath43 in our case we can neglect the companion s light because @xmath44 . the orbit of ab derived here and the astrometric orbit of @xcite correspond to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "knowing that the companion b must be a close binary , we tried to detect this sub - system spectroscopically , despite its small contribution to the combined light .",

    "two 300-s exposures with the image slicer were taken , accompanied by the comparison spectrum of the thorium - argon ( thar ) lamp . during this period ,",
    "the position of the thar spectrum remained stable on the ccd to better than 1 pixel .",
    "moreover , on the first night the star hip  14086 was observed as a rv reference .    extracted and wavelength - calibrated spectra were delivered by the pipeline running at the yale university .",
    "they contain 59 echelle orders ( central wavelengths from 4605   to 8713 ) of 3200 pixels each ( 1.0768 km  s@xmath12 per pixel ) . as red orders with @xmath66   suffer from extraction and calibration problems ( too few thorium lines ) ,",
    "they are not used here .",
    "the maximum intensity in the spectra varies from night to night with a total range of two times ( from 25 to 50 thousand electrons per pixel ) .",
    "this corresponds to a s / n from 160 to 220 .",
    "radial velocities of @xmath0  for were derived by cross - correlating the spectra with a binary mask which equals one in the lines of the solar spectrum and zero otherwise .",
    "the mask was constructed from the digital solar spectrum @xcite , binary - clipped at 0.6 of the continuum level .",
    "the cross - correlation is computed in the wavelength range from 4600  to 6500 , thus avoiding the contamination by telluric lines at longer wavelengths .",
    "regions within @xmath67   of the hydrogen bahlmer lines are excluded from the mask .",
    "the minimum in the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is approximated by a gaussian curve , its center is taken to be the apparent stellar radial velocity , which is then corrected to the barycenter of the solar system in the standard way .",
    "this procedure relies on the wavelength calibration of the reduced spectra .",
    "we attempted to refine the velocity zero point by cross - correlating red orders with the mask of telluric lines , but did not obtain any trustworthy results , probably because of the poor wavelength calibration in the red .",
    "figure  [ fig : rv ] shows the rvs derived from 12 individual spectra as a function of time ( the average rv for each night is listed in table  [ tab : rv ] ) .",
    "the linear trend of 2.9 m  s@xmath12 per day is caused by the orbital motion .",
    "the rms scatter of rv around this line is 6.8 m  s@xmath12 , the rms residual to the orbit is 6.7 m  s@xmath12 . as measures from the two nightly spectra",
    "agree well , most of the scatter can be attributed to the wavelength calibration based on the thar lamp .",
    "the mean fwhm of the gaussian fits to the ccf is 12.96 km  s@xmath12 , their equivalent width is 5.59 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the same procedure applied to hip  14086 gives an rv of @xmath68 km  s@xmath12 . according to @xcite",
    "the rv of this star is constant at @xmath69 km  s@xmath12 , but @xcite list a quite different value of @xmath70 km  s@xmath12 ( while simbad lists the wrong rv of @xmath71 km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "apparently , this star is a yet unrecognized slow spectroscopic binary , unsuitable as a rv standard .",
    "however , we use our rv measure of hip  14086 to derive the rv of @xmath0  for from the two spectra taken in february 2012 during chiron tests ( those spectra lack wavelength calibration ) .",
    "these two measures with a somewhat uncertain zero point are given low weight in the orbit solution by adopting errors of 0.5 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "we detect a tiny variability of the h@xmath39 profile presumably caused by the moving emission of ba and bb .",
    "this is achieved by subtracting the template obtained by averaging all spectra together .",
    "although the spectrometer was very stable during these observations , the spectrum moved on the ccd by 12 km  s@xmath12 owing to the variable barycentric correction .",
    "the template was constructed by shifting the nightly - averaged spectra ( with a 3-pixel median smoothing of each spectrum to remove the cosmic - rays spikes ) to match the night 1 , normalizing them in intensity , and adding together .",
    "obviously , the telluric lines do not move together with the stellar lines and therefore show up in the residuals between the individual spectra and the template .",
    "the rms residuals after template subtraction are 0.7% in the order 37 containing h@xmath39 and 0.5% in the blue orders which are free from the telluric lines .",
    "we see a clear residual signal in the h@xmath39 line on the nights 1 and 5 , while on the remaining nights the residuals are close to zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) . similar features of lower amplitude are also seen in the h@xmath72 line , confirming their reality .",
    "the single `` emission '' peak on the night 5 can be approximated by gaussian curves .",
    "their amplitude is 2.1% and 1.3% for h@xmath39 and h@xmath72 respectively , and they are shifted relative to the stellar spectrum by @xmath73   and @xmath74   which corresponds to @xmath75 km  s@xmath12 and @xmath76 km  s@xmath12 . if the emission originated on the slowly - rotating primary companion a ( @xmath77 km  s@xmath12 ) , it would be centered on the stellar line rather than shifted .",
    "we show below that on the night 5 the lines of ba and bb were superimposed near their center - of - mass velocity which should be displaced by @xmath78 km  s@xmath12 relative to the rv of a according to the orbit ( the masses of a and ba+bb being near - equal ) .",
    "the double peak on the night 1 also matches the expected position of the emission from ba and bb .",
    "the non - detection of emission features on the other four nights could possibly be explained by variable activity of the m - dwarfs .",
    "we detect the signature of absorption lines belonging to ba and bb by correlating the residual spectra ( after subtracting the template , see above ) with the solar or arcturus masks ( the latter is analogous to the solar binary mask but uses the digital arcturus spectrum from the same source ) .",
    "only wavelengths shorter than 6500   are used in the correlation .",
    "the resulting ccf has a weak narrow feature centered on the rv of a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] ) .",
    "this feature originates because the resolution of the template spectrum is slightly less than the resolution of the nightly spectra owing to small residual alignment errors in the template creation . the sign and intensity of this feature",
    "depend on the relative degree of smoothing applied to the spectra and the template .",
    "apart from the central feature , we see additional dips with variable position and intensity , presumably produced by ba and bb .",
    "gaussian approximations of the strongest dips have fwhm between 15 and 23 km  s@xmath12 and equivalent width of about 0.0017 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the star gives a ccf with equivalent width of 3.54 km  s@xmath12 for the arcturus mask , so the dip ratio corresponds to the flux difference on the order of @xmath79 ( we neglect here the different match of the arcturus mask with the late - type spectrum of ba on one hand and with the g0v spectrum of a on the other hand ) . a fake companion of 0.5% relative intensity ( @xmath80 fainter than the primary ) is readily detectable by this method ( see the upper curve in fig .

    "the dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] are gaussian dips corresponding to the ba and bb components respectively and positioned according to this tentative orbit ( not fitted to the ccf ) .",
    "the assumed amplitudes of both gaussians are @xmath640.0007 , their fwhm is 16 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "on the night 1 we clearly see both dips . on the nights 3 and 4",
    "the ccfs of residuals look almost identical , the dips are near the maximum separation .",
    "remember that the template includes the average spectrum of ba and bb , so their lines near maximum separation ( the most frequent situation ) are partially subtracted , leaving only small residuals . on the night 5 the dips overlap near the @xmath10-velocity .",
    "the reality of the detection of ba and bb was checked by correlating the residuals with the synthetic spectrum of a late - type dwarf .",
    "we used the @xmath82 spectrum from @xcite ] with parameters @xmath83k , @xmath84 , and solar metallicity .",
    "the resulting ccf should have a peak corresponding to the velocity of the secondary .",
    "indeed , we see in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : res1 ] . to highlight these features , we again over - plot fiducial gaussians with an amplitude of + 0.00007 and velocities predicted by the tentative ba , bb orbit .",

    "the rv amplitude of our tentative ba , bb orbit is therefore in qualitative agreement with its period .",
    "the triple system @xmath0  for consists of the main slightly evolved ( age 46gyr ) component a of 1.2@xmath15 , and a pair of m - dwarfs of @xmath350.5@xmath15 each on a tight orbit with a tentative period of 3.7d .",

    "high - resolution spectroscopy in the near - infrared where the contrast of ba , bb is more favorable will help in this endeavor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given the short period , eclipses in ba , bb are likely , but their photometric detection presents a challenge because of the small ( sub - percent ) amplitude in the combined visible light .",
    "precise photometry will eventually detect flares on the active m dwarfs .",
