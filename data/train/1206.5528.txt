    "azimuthal anisotropies of particle distributions relative to the reaction plane ( plane subtended by the impact parameter and beam direction ) in high energy heavy - ion collisions have been used to characterize the collision dynamics  @xcite . in a picture of hydrodynamic expansion of the system formed in the collisions ,",
    "these anisotropies are expected to arise due to initial pressure gradients and subsequent interactions of the constituents  @xcite .",
    "specifically , differential measurements  @xcite of azimuthal anisotropy have been found to be sensitive to ( a ) the equation of state ( eos ) , ( b ) thermalization , ( c ) transport coefficients of the medium , and ( d ) initial conditions in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "hence it is important to study the dependence of azimuthal anisotropy as a function of several variables , for example center - of - mass energy ( ) , collision centrality , transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) , and pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) .    recently a beam - energy scan ( bes ) program has begun at rhic to study the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the bes program extends the baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath11 ) reach of rhic from 20 to about 400 mev  @xcite .",
    "the baryon chemical potential decreases with the decrease in the beam energy while the chemical freeze - out temperature increases with increase in beam energy  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to study azimuthal anisotropy at midrapidity with varying net - baryon densities .",
    "lattice qcd calculations suggest that the quark - hadron transition is a crossover for high temperature ( @xmath12 ) systems with small @xmath11 or high  @xcite .",
    "several model calculations suggest that at larger values of @xmath11 or lower the transition is expected to be first order  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations suggest a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath2 could be observed around this `` softest point of the eos ''  @xcite .",
    "the softest point of the eos is usually referred to as the temparature / time during which the velocity of sound has a minimum value ( or reduction in the pressure of the system ) during the evolution .",
    "non - monotonic variation of azimuthal anisotropy as a function of collision centrality and could indicate the softest point of the eos in heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "further it has been argued that the observation of saturation of differential azimuthal anisotropies @xmath8 of charged hadrons in collisions in the range of 62.4 - 200 gev is a signature of a mixed phase  @xcite .",
    "the new data presented in this paper shows to what extent such a saturation effect is observed .",
    "several analysis methods for @xmath2 have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these are found to be sensitive in varying degrees to non - flow contributions ( e.g. correlations due to jets , resonances , etc . ) and flow fluctuations .",
    "@xmath13 measurements from various methods have been judiciously used to constrain these contributions , in addition to providing estimates of systematic errors associated with the measurements  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly useful for interpreting results of identified hadron @xmath13 values where , due to limitations of event statistics , it is not possible to use all methods for @xmath13 analysis . the measurements over a range of energies may provide insights to the evolution of non - flow and flow fluctuations as a function of collision energy .",
    "inclusive charged hadron elliptic flow measurements at top rhic energies have been one of the most widely studied observables from the theoretical perspective .",
    "it has been shown that transport models , which provide a microscopic description of the early and late non - equilibrium stages of the system , significantly underpredict @xmath2 at top rhic energies , while the inclusion of partonic effects provides a more satisfactory explanation  @xcite .",
    "the new data discussed here will provide an opportunity to study the contribution of partonic matter and hadronic matter to the @xmath2 measurements as a function of or ( @xmath12 , @xmath14 ) by comparisons with models .    in this paper",
    "we present measurements of the second harmonic azimuthal anisotropy using data taken in the bes program from = 7.7 to 39 gev .",
    "we discuss the detectors used in the analysis , data selections and methods used to determine inclusive charged hadron @xmath13 in sections ii and iii .",
    "section iv gives @xmath2 results for inclusive charged hadrons from different analysis methods .",
    "we discuss the centrality , @xmath1 , @xmath15 and dependence of @xmath13 in section v , and compare to calculations from transport models .",
    "finally , a summary of the analysis is presented in section vi .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected during the tenth and eleventh rhic runs ( 2010 and 2011 ) with the star detector using minimum - bias triggers ( requiring a combination of signals from the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite , zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite , and vertex position detectors ( vpd )  @xcite ) . for the 7.7 and 11.5 gev data , at least one hit in the full barrel time - of - flight detector  @xcite",
    "was required in order to further reduce the background .",
    "the main time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite and two forward time projection chambers ( ftpcs )  @xcite were used for particle tracking in the central region ( @xmath3 ) and forward regions ( @xmath16 ) respectively . both the tpc and ftpcs provided azimuthal acceptance over @xmath17 .",
    "the bbc detector subsystem consists of two detectors mounted around the beam pipe , each located outside the star magnet pole - tip at opposite ends of the tpc approximately 375 cm from the center of the nominal interaction point .",
    "each bbc detector consists of hexagonal scintillator tiles arranged in four concentric rings that provided full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the inner tiles of the bbcs , with a pseudorapidity range of @xmath18 were used to reconstruct the event plane in one elliptic flow analysis .",
    "events for analysis are selected based on collision vertex positions within 2 cm of the beam axis to reduce contributions from beam - gas and beam - pipe ( at a radius of 4 cm ) interactions , and within a limited distance from the center of the detector along the beam direction ( @xmath19 cm for the 7.7 gev data set , @xmath20 cm for the 11.5 gev data set , and @xmath21 cm for the 19.6 , 27 and 39 gev data sets ) .",
    "these values are chosen to reduce systematics due to variance in detector performance over @xmath3 while retaining sufficient statistics .",
    "after quality cuts , about 4 million @xmath22 central events remain for 7.7 gev , 11 million for 11.5 gev , 20 million for 19.6 gev , 40 million for 27 gev and 120 million for 39 gev data sets .",
    "the results from more peripheral collisions are not presented due to trigger inefficiencies at low multiplicity .",
    "the centrality was defined using the number of charged tracks with quality cuts similar to those in ref .",
    "the details of the centrality determination will be discussed in subsection c. the @xmath22 central events for @xmath13 analysis of charged hadrons are divided into nine centrality bins : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    a variety of track quality cuts are used to select good charged particle tracks reconstructed using information from the tpc or ftpcs .",
    "the distance of closest approach ( dca ) of the track to the primary vertex is taken to be less than 2 cm .",
    "we require that the tpc and ftpcs have a number of fit points used for reconstruction of the tracks to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "for the tpc and ftpcs the ratio of the number of fit points to maximum possible hits is @xmath34 .",
    "an additional transverse momentum cut ( @xmath35 ) is applied to the charged tracks for the tpc and ftpc event plane determination .",
    "the centrality classes are defined based on the uncorrected charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath36 ) distribution in the tpc for pseudorapidity @xmath37 0.5 and full azimuth .    figure  [ fig : centrality ] shows the @xmath36 distribution for charged particles from the data at = 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 and 39 gev compared to those from monte carlo ( mc ) glauber simulations .",

    "the fitting parameter @xmath41 is the average multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity in minimum - bias @xmath42 + @xmath42 collisions and @xmath43 is the fraction of production from the hard component .",

    "beyond @xmath55 the @xmath2 results show comparable values within statistical errors .",
    "the increase of @xmath10 as a function of energy could be due to the change of chemical composition from low to high energies  @xcite and/or larger collectivity at the higher collision energy .",

    "the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath2 ratio can not be reproduced by pure viscous hydrodynamic simulations with a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ( @xmath59 ) , and zero net baryon density .",

    "the differences are reduced as the collision energy decreases . that the ratio of data to urqmd results are closer to 1 at the lower collision energy indicates that the contribution of hadronic interactions becomes more significant at lower collision energies .",

    "<S> values of @xmath2 , scaled by the initial coordinate space eccentricity , @xmath7 , as a function of @xmath0 are larger in more central collisions , suggesting stronger collective flow develops in more central collisions , similar to the results at higher collision energies . </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared to measurements at higher energies at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( @xmath4 = 62.4 and 200 gev ) and at the large hadron collider ( pb + pb collisions at @xmath4 = 2.76 tev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 values for fixed @xmath0 rise with increasing collision energy within the @xmath0 range studied ( @xmath9 ) . a comparison to viscous hydrodynamic simulations </S>",
    "<S> is made to potentially help understand the energy dependence of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the @xmath2 results to urqmd and ampt transport model calculations , and physics implications on the dominance of partonic versus hadronic phases in the system created at beam energy scan ( bes ) energies are discussed . </S>"
