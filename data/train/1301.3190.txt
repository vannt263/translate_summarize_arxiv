    "for an integer @xmath5 , a density @xmath6 defined on @xmath1 is said to be @xmath0-monotone if it is nonincreasing when @xmath2 , and if @xmath7 is nonincreasing and convex for all @xmath8 when @xmath9 . considering the problem of estimating a density in one of these classes presents several interesting features . as shown in @xcite and @xcite , both the mle and lse of a @xmath0-monotone density exist .",
    "these estimators generalize the grenander estimator of a nonincreasing density ( @xmath2 ) and the mle and lse of a nonincreasing and convex density ( @xmath3 ) studied by @xcite .    while it is known that the grenander estimator in the case @xmath2 converges pointwise at the rate @xmath10 and that the mle of a convex nonincreasing density converges pointwise at the rate @xmath11 , the rate of convergence @xmath12 for the mle ( or lse ) of a @xmath0-monotone density in the general case @xmath13 studied in @xcite depends on a key conjecture which has not yet been verified .",
    "in fact we show here that the spline conjectures made in @xcite fail to hold . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite obtained a result concerning the global rate of convergence of the mle of a @xmath0-monotone density for a general @xmath13 : they showed that the rate of convergence of the mle with respect to the hellinger metric is indeed @xmath12 .",
    "the limit case @xmath14 corresponds to the intersection of all @xmath0-monotone classes , that is the class of completely monotone densities on @xmath1 .",
    "the latter turns out to be equal to the the class of mixtures of exponentials , a consequence of bernstein  widder theorem , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the nonparametric mle of a mixture of exponentials was considered by @xcite who showed its consistency and developed an em algorithm to compute the estimator .",
    "so far , there are no results available on the limit distribution of the completely monotone mle .",
    "as noted in @xcite , one natural approach seems to study the behavior of the mle in the @xmath0-monotone class as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "such an approach requires evidently a deep understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0-monotone mle and of the distance between its knots .    for an arbitrary @xmath5 ,",
    "the work of @xcite aims to give a general approach to derive the limit distribution of the mle and lse at a fixed point @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , their work can be seen as an extension of the approach used by @xcite in convex estimation .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the true @xmath0-monotone density . at @xmath18 , and",
    "modulo the spline conjecture , it is shown that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is either the mle or lse , and @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "note that the constants @xmath23 appear also in the asymptotic minimax lower bound for @xmath24 risk ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a two - sided brownian motion on @xmath27 . the process @xmath28 appearing in the limit is characterized by the following conditions :    \\(i ) the process @xmath29 stays everywhere above the process @xmath30 : @xmath31    \\(ii ) @xmath32 is @xmath33-convex , i.e. , @xmath34 exists and is convex .",
    "\\(iii ) the process @xmath29 satisfies @xmath35    \\(iv ) if @xmath0 is even , @xmath36 for @xmath37 ; if @xmath0 is odd , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .    because there is so far no device equivalent to the switching relationship device used in the monotone problem ( see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite ) , the proof by @xcite of the limit of the convex estimators is more complex and built in several steps .",
    "one of the most crucial pieces of this proof is that the stochastic order @xmath41 for the distance between two knot points of the estimators in a small neighborhood of @xmath18 .",
    "this result holds true under the assumption that the true convex density @xmath6 is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath18 such that @xmath42 .    in the monotone problem",
    ", one can also show that the distance between the jump points of the grenander estimator is stochastically bounded above by @xmath43 provided that @xmath6 is continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath18 such that @xmath44 .",
    "these working assumptions can be naturally put in the following general form : the true @xmath0-monotone density is @xmath0-times continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath18 such that @xmath45 .",
    "thus , it seems natural that @xmath46 gives the general stochastic order for all integers @xmath5 . as noted in @xcite , @xcite",
    "have , in the context of fitting a regression curve via splines , already conjectured that @xmath46 is the order of the distance between the knot points of their regression spline under the assumption that the true regression curve satisfies our same working assumptions .    in the extension of the argument of @xcite to an arbitrary @xmath0 , we have found that there is a need to show that an envelope of a certain vc - class is bounded . in the next section",
    ", we describe this fact more precisely , and give the connection to our two spline conjectures made in @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we show that these conjecture are false for @xmath47 .",
    "the argument can be generalized to @xmath48 but the calculations rapidly become cumbersome . in section 4 , we give a number of suggestions for building an alternative proof for the limit theory of the @xmath0-monotone estimators .",
    "we begin with some notation . for integers @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath51 the space of splines on @xmath52 $ ] of degree @xmath53 and internal knots @xmath54 .",

    "we denote by @xmath67 the spline interpolation operator which assigns to @xmath59 its spline interpolant @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the lse of the true @xmath0-monotone density @xmath6 based on @xmath69 i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath70 .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that @xmath71 exists , is unique , and is a spline of degree @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 denote its @xmath0-fold integral , that is @xmath74 the function @xmath73 is important due to its direct involvement in the characterization of the estimator @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , if we consider the @xmath75-fold integral of the empirical distribution @xmath76 @xmath77 then the spline @xmath71 of degree @xmath72 is the lse if and only if the following ( fenchel ) conditions hold @xmath78 the greater focus put on the lse is explained by the fact that the characterization in is much simpler to study , especially when the empirical processes involved are localized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was shown by @xcite that understanding the asymptotics of the lse is enough as one can use strong consistency of the mle to linearize its characterization and put it in a more familiar form .",
    "one of the key points in the study of the asymptotics is to note that the characterization of the lse implies @xmath79 and @xmath80 for a knot @xmath81 of @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , given @xmath82 knots @xmath83 , @xmath68 is uniquely determined on @xmath84 $ ] by the interpolation equalities @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "in other words , @xmath88 is a hermite spline interpolant of @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90(x ) \\qquad \\mbox{for } x \\in [ \\tau_0 , \\tau_{2k-3}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in any small neighborhood of the estimation point @xmath18 , strong consistency of the @xmath75-st derivative of @xmath68 combined with the assumption that @xmath91 guarantee that the number of knots in that neighborhood tends to @xmath92 almost surely as @xmath16 .",
    "hence , finding at least @xmath82 knots is possible with probability one . at this stage , we know that @xmath93 almost surely as @xmath16 , and our goal is to show that this convergence occurs with a rate equal to @xmath46 . in the next section ,",
    "we describe briefly the key argument in the proof of @xcite and recall the two related spline conjectures .",

    "( b ) find a lower bound for @xmath127 as a function of a power of the distance @xmath128 .    in the absence of any knowledge about the location and distribution of the random knots",
    "@xmath129 , it seems naturally desirable to get of rid of any dependency on these points .",

    "together with the fact that the class @xmath149 is a vc - subgraph , this gives one of the most crucial results that helps establishing the stochastic order of the gap : the right  stochastic bound @xmath150 on the other hand , the term @xmath125 could be bounded using conjecture [ conjecture2 ] .",

    "it seems likely that these random knots for the lse actually do not `` coalesce '' , but stay bounded away from each other asymptotically ( at the rate @xmath46 ) , and hence we expect to have @xmath212 or , equivalently @xmath213 if we could show that ( [ noncoalesenceofknotsinprob ] ) holds , then the classes of functions involved in the interpolation errors could be restricted to classes involving separated knots and the conjectures may be more plausible for these restricted classes .      while the methods of proof used in @xcite ( and @xcite , @xcite ) are based on empirical process inequalities which rely the small or scaling properties of envelopes ( see e.g. lemma a.1 , page 2560 of @xcite or lemma 4.1 of @xcite ) , as opposed to smallness of the individual functions in the class relative to an envelope as in lemmas 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the proofs of the ( global ) rate of convergence of hellinger distance from the mle @xmath214 to @xmath108 established in @xcite rely on inequalities for suprema of empirical processes based on uniform or bracketing entropy for function classes in which the @xmath215norms of individual functions are small relative to envelope functions ( which may possibly be unbounded ) ( see e.g. lemmas 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 and theorem 3.4.4 of @xcite for bracketing entropy type bounds , and see @xcite for classes with well behaved uniform entropy bounds ; the results of @xcite might also be helpful in connection with the latter classes ) .",
    "while the inequalities discussed in option b above involve application of empirical process inequalities involving `` strong parameters '' such as the expected values of envelope functions , there remains some possibility for the development of new inequalities based on `` weak parameters '' ; see e.g. the discussion on page 51 of @xcite and the material on page 209 of @xcite .",
