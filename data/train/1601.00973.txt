    "nonperturbative qcd poses significant challenges .",
    "primary amongst them is a need to chart the behaviour of qcd s running coupling and masses into the domain of infrared momenta .",
    "contemporary theory is incapable of solving this problem alone but a collaboration with experiment holds a promise for progress .",
    "this effort can benefit substantially by exposing the structure of nucleon excited states and measuring the associated transition form factors at large momentum transfers  @xcite .",
    "large momenta are needed in order to pierce the meson - cloud that , often to a significant extent , screens the dressed - quark core of all baryons  @xcite ; and it is via the @xmath1 evolution of form factors that one gains access to the running of qcd s coupling and masses from the infrared into the ultraviolet  @xcite .",
    "a unified qcd - based description of elastic and transition form factors involving the nucleon and its resonances has acquired additional significance owing to substantial progress in the extraction of transition electrocouplings , @xmath2 , from meson electroproduction data , obtained primarily with the clas detector at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "the electrocouplings of all low - lying @xmath3 states with mass less - than @xmath4 have been determined via independent analyses of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 exclusive channels  @xcite ; and preliminary results for the @xmath2 electrocouplings of most high - lying @xmath3 states with masses below @xmath8 have also been obtained from clas meson electroproduction data  @xcite .",
    "many new insights have been revealed in a series of recent articles  @xcite focused on the calculation of the nucleon , delta and roper elastic and transition form factors using a widely - used leading - order ( rainbow - ladder ) truncation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations and comparing results between a qcd - based framework and a vector@xmath0vector contact interaction .",

    "these remarks highlight that @xmath55 is not particularly sensitive to details of the faddeev kernel and transition current .",

    "the appearance of a single zero in @xmath58-wave components of the faddeev wave function associated with the first excited state in the three dressed - quark scattering problem indicates that this state is a radial excitation .",

    ", these values appear unrelated to those obtained within the dses framework .",

    "this faddeev equation should therefore be understood as producing the dressed - quark core of the bound - state , not the completely - dressed and hence observable object .",

    "the mismatch between the dse predictions and data on @xmath72 is due to meson - cloud contributions that are expected to be important on this domain .",
    "an inferred form of that contribution is provided by the dotted ( green ) curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucrop_v2 ] .",
    "these curves have fallen to just 20% of their maximum value by @xmath73 and vanish rapidly thereafter so that the dse predictions alone remain as the explanation of the data .",
    "importantly , the existence of a zero in @xmath74 is not influenced by meson - cloud effects , although its precise location is .",
    "we described a unified study of nucleon , delta and roper elastic and transition form factors that compares predictions made by a qcd - kindred framework with results obtained using a symmetry - preserving treatment of a vector@xmath0vector contact - interaction .",
    "the comparison emphasises that experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running coupling and masses in qcd . amongst our results ,",
    "the following are of particular interest : the presence of strong diquark correlations within the nucleon is sufficient to understand empirical extractions of the flavour - separated form factors . in connection with the @xmath45 transition",
    ", the momentum - dependence of the magnetic transition form factor , @xmath75 , matches that of @xmath76 once the momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson - cloud ; and the electric quadrupole ratio is a keen measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum correlations , the zero in which is obscured by meson - cloud effects on the domain currently accessible to experiment . finally , the roper resonance is at heart of the nucleon s first radial excitation , consisting of a dressed - quark core augmented by a meson cloud that reduces its mass by approximately @xmath77 .",
    "our analysis shows that a meson - cloud obscures the dressed - quark core from long - wavelength probes , but that it is revealed to probes with @xmath78 .",
