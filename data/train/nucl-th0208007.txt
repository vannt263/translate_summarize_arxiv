    "controversial experimental hints on the existence of three - neutron ( @xmath10 ) resonances [ 1 - 4 ] and more recently even on four - neutron resonances [ 5 ] occurred again and again .",
    "no definite experimental conclusion on @xmath10 resonances seem to exist . on the theoretical side",
    "we are aware of various attempts to investigate states of @xmath10 s but also here the situation is pretty unsettled . obviously the optimal theoretical present day insight would be if the most modern neutron - neutron ( @xmath11 ) forces from the set of high precision @xmath12 potentials together with @xmath10 forces of the @xmath13-exchange type ( tucson - melbourne [ 6 ] or urbana type [ 7 ] ) would be used and the energy eigenvalues of the @xmath10 schrdinger equation according to resonance boundary conditions would be determined in the unphysical energy sheet adjacent to the positive real energy axis .",
    "unfortunately we can not provide such an insight right now but think we can improve at least on the existing studies we are aware of .",
    "one of the possibly first studies on that list is a solution of the @xmath10 faddeev equation based on a yamaguchi rank 1 @xmath11 force in the state @xmath14  [ 8 ] .",
    "only the @xmath10 states of total angular momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( degenerate in this case ) have been studied .",
    "the @xmath11 force was artificially enhanced such that two and three neutrons were bound .",
    "then the enhancement was reduced which has the consequence that both bound state energies move towards @xmath3 . for the forces used it happened that the @xmath10 binding energy moves faster than the @xmath17 binding energy and thus hits the dineutron - neutron threshold to the left of @xmath3 .",
    "the trajectory of the @xmath10 bound state energy continues then into the unphysical sheet below the dineutron - neutron cut . in this manner",
    "a @xmath10 resonance occurs , below the @xmath10 break - up threshold at @xmath3 . further decreasing the enhancement factor the @xmath10 resonance trajectory moves up again exactly towards @xmath3 where it meets with the @xmath17 bound state energy .",
    "both energies coincide exactly at @xmath3 corresponding still to an enhancement factor larger than 1 . in further decreasing the potential strength till one reaches the physical value 1 the vanishing @xmath17 bound state energy turns into the well established @xmath17 virtual state energy in the second sheet on the negative real energy axis and the @xmath10 resonance disappears in a unphysical sheet which is different from the sheet adjacent to the positive real axis . in other words the complex resonance energy of that @xmath10 resonance for @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "has no positive real part and therefore can not be felt for positive three - neutron energies .",
    "we have to emphasise that this refers to a @xmath11 force acting only in the state @xmath14 and it will change if additional @xmath11 force components will be added as will be shown in this paper .    a very much related study has been performed in [ 9 ] with essentially the same result as in [ 8 ] . using just bound state techniques [ 10 ] the necessary enhancement factors on the @xmath11 forces in @xmath0- and @xmath18-waves have been determined to bind 3 neutrons near zero energy .",
    "based on the reid potential [ 11 ] enhancement factors of the order of 4 have been found which make low lying @xmath10 resonances quite unlikely .    another theoretical investigation [ 12 ]",
    "we are aware of for the state @xmath15 has been performed on the basis of a hyperspherical harmonic expansion .",
    "local forces like the ones of mafliet tjon have been used and this only in the @xmath11 state @xmath14 .",
    "the expansion was truncated and the zeros of the jost function were determined .",
    "it resulted a resonance energy around @xmath19 mev in an unphysical sheet .",
    "the authors found a strong sensitivity to the choice of the potential .    a further investigation [ 13 ] relied on a variational ansatz and used the complex scaling method which allows to treat a resonance problem like a bound state one .",
    "the minnesota effective @xmath11 force [ 14 ] together with tensor forces [ 15 ] have been applied .",
    "the authors find as the only candidate for a @xmath10 resonance the state @xmath20 and a prediction for its energy of @xmath21 mev .    finally in a more recent work [ 16 ]",
    "the faddeev equation in configuration space has been solved for the states @xmath15 and @xmath22 using the more realistic forces by gogny _",
    "[ 17 ] and the reid93 [ 18 ] potential in the @xmath17 states @xmath14 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 - @xmath25 .",
    "choosing proper boundary conditions according to @xmath10 resonances the complex energy eigenvalues are determined starting again from artificially enhanced forces and reducing their strengths gradually .",
    "unfortunately with increasing negative imaginary parts of the complex resonance energies numerical instabilities occurred and the trajectories could not be followed up until the physical values for the enhancement factors have been reached .",
    "now we would like to improve on all that by solving the faddeev equations with low rank @xmath11 forces in all relevant partial wave states exactly and determining the final resonance positions for the actual force strength as prescribed by @xmath11 phase shifts ( assumed to be identical to the strong @xmath26 phase shifts ) .",
    "in the light of our results we shall also comment on the previous findings .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the set of coupled faddeev eigenvalue equations for a @xmath10 system based on finite rank forces and mention the steps needed for an analytical continuation into the unphysical energy sheet adjacent to the positive real axis . the dynamical @xmath11 force input and the resulting @xmath10 resonance trajectories for the states @xmath27 and @xmath22 are presented in section iii . in section",
    "iv we show how the part of the @xmath10 resonance trajectory close to the threshold @xmath3 can be predicted with the help of pad approximant s from a set of @xmath10 bound state energies .",
    "this serves as a test for our results obtained through the analytical continuation of the faddeev equation .",
    "though the final @xmath10 resonance positions could not be reached with that method , we think this illustration should be of interest since it works beautifully for resonances close to the first threshold and requires only bound state techniques .",
    "we summarise in section v.",
    "the faddeev equation for three identical nucleons has the well known form [ 19 ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the free @xmath30 propagator , @xmath31 the @xmath12 @xmath31-matrix and @xmath18 the sum of a cyclical and anti - cyclical permutation of 3 objects .",
    "we regard that equation in a momentum space representation and partial wave decomposed .",
    "it results a set of coupled equations in two variables , p and q , which are the magnitudes of two relative momenta . in the present investigation",
    "we shall use @xmath31-matrices of finite rank .",
    "the set of two - dimensional equations changes then into a set of coupled one - dimensional ones .",
    "they have the well known form @xmath32 and @xmath33 is connected to @xmath34 via @xmath35 the underlying two - body @xmath31-matrices are @xmath36    the corresponding form factors @xmath37 depend on the obvious two - body quantum numbers @xmath38 .",
    "the two - body subsystem energy @xmath39 is given in terms of the total energy @xmath40 and the kinetic energy of relative motion of the third particle .",
    "further @xmath41 stands for the string of three - body quantum numbers @xmath42 for all those by now standard notations we refer to [ 19 ] . finally @xmath43 are geometrical coefficients arising from the partial wave representation of the permutation operator @xmath18 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are shifted arguments related to @xmath18 and depend on @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , see [ 19 ] for details .",
    "we are interested in @xmath10 bound state and resonance energies , the latter ones emerging from bound state energies when the artificially increased interaction strength is reduced . since",
    "two neutrons are not bound in nature the only unphysical sheet of interest is the one which can be reached through the cut along @xmath49 . it will be denoted in the following simply as the unphysical sheet . while for @xmath50 there is no singular denominator , for @xmath51 the free propagator in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is not defined . the well established manner to analytically continue",
    "the coupled set of equations in the energy into the unphysical sheet is to deform the path of integration into the lower half plane .",
    "this has been described for instance in [ 8 ] and [ 20 ] .",
    "the singularities which are avoided in this manner arise from the free propagator and the form factors .",
    "the @xmath52-function is not singular for energies @xmath53 in the unphysical sheet under investigation . a typical path in the complex @xmath46-plane ( for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) together with domains of singularity arising from the free propagator for the example @xmath54 mev is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the strategy now as pointed out in the introduction is to first enhance the @xmath11 forces such that a @xmath10 bound state exists . at the same time also",
    "two - neutron bound states might exist .",
    "then by suitably chosen enhancement factors one can achieve that the two - body bound state energies coincide and move together towards @xmath3 , when the enhancements are reduced . in all cases we studied the @xmath10 bound state energies stayed always to the left of the two - body bound state energies until they reached @xmath3 .",
    "this was not the case in [ 8 ] , where for the degenerate states @xmath55 and @xmath16 only the @xmath14 force had been kept .",
    "here we include on top @xmath18- and @xmath56-wave forces and such a coincidence of @xmath10 and @xmath17 bound state energies does not occur .",
    "once the two - neutron bound state energies have disappeared we still have a @xmath10 bound state . then reducing the enhancement factors",
    "further the @xmath10 bound state energy will approach @xmath3 and then the energy eigenvalue @xmath40 will dive into the lower half plane of the unphysical sheet . there",
    "we shall follow its trajectory until the physical strengths of the @xmath11 forces are reached .",
    "this defines the final positions of the @xmath10 resonances .",
    "it is well known and easily seen that what we call @xmath10 resonance energies are poles of the @xmath10 @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we use @xmath11 forces of rank 2 . they are given in appendix a.",
    "they describe @xmath26 phase shifts ( without coulomb force ) reasonably well as documented in the appendix .",
    "we restrict our study to the states @xmath14 , @xmath23,@xmath24 and @xmath57 .",
    "the coupling between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is neglected .",
    "the @xmath11 force in the state @xmath58 is repulsive and therefore we did not include it in the main investigation , since it has to be expected , that it will move the @xmath10 resonance position further away from the positive real energy axis . at the end we shall consider its effect and show that its influence has indeed repulsive character but only a marginal one and could therefore indeed be neglected .",
    "we shall investigate now the 4 possible states @xmath59 and @xmath60 in turn .",
    "we use up to 10 three - neutron channels which are displayed in table 1 . to reach a @xmath10 bound state",
    "it is sufficient to enhance just the @xmath24 @xmath11 force and to keep all the other force components at their physical values . as an example for an enhancement factor we quote @xmath61 where the 3 neutrons in a 10 channel calculation are bound at @xmath62 mev .",
    "the threshold energy @xmath3 is reached for @xmath63 . for the sake of future comparisons we provide a few intermediate @xmath10 resonance positions in table 2 . the @xmath10 resonance trajectory is shown in fig .  2 for a 10 channel calculation .",
    "the trajectories for a smaller number of channels are very similar .",
    "the final resonance positions for an increasing number of channels in the order given in table 1 are displayed in table 3 .",
    "adding more @xmath11 force components will certainly not change the final position in a significant manner in the sense that the position would come somewhere close to the positive real energy axis .",
    "if one adds the @xmath58 @xmath11 force , which is of repulsive nature , we have 13 channels and the final resonance position shifts by @xmath64 mev , which is marginal .    in ref.[16 ] which can be considered to be the most realistic approach towards three - neutron resonances carried out so far the rather realistic @xmath11 forces by gogny [ 17 ] and reid93 [ 18 ] have been used .",
    "in contrast to our simplified forces they also include the tensor force induced coupling @xmath65 .",
    "for the case of the gogny potential the enhancement factor for the @xmath65 @xmath11 force component was about 4.4 to have @xmath10 s bound at zero energy , while for our simplified force this was the smaller value of @xmath66 . in [ 16 ] reducing @xmath67 to @xmath68 yields a resonance energy of @xmath69 mev , while at this value our @xmath10 system is still bound .",
    "thus one might conjecture that in the more realistic case the @xmath10 resonance would be even further shifted away from the positive real energy axis .",
    "on the other hand the motion of our resonance energy for a change of @xmath70 from the threshold @xmath3 ( corresponding to an enhancement factor @xmath71 ) is @xmath72 mev , which is slightly larger . therefore a direct quantitative comparison is not possible , though qualitatively the results are similar .",
    "this is also true for the case of reid93 , also considered in [ 16 ] , where the enhancement factor @xmath73 yields a resonance position of @xmath74 mev .",
