    "one of the most intriguing problems of mesoscopic physics is possibility of quantum superposition of macroscopic states .",
    "it is especially urgent because of the aspiration for realization of the idea of the quantum computation [ 1 ] .",
    "ambiguous experiments [ 2 ] can not be considered as an evidence of the macroscopic quantum superposition and possibility of solid - state qubit because of the obvious contradiction between quantum mechanics and macroscopic realism [ 3 ] .",
    "quantum superposition presupposes that single measurement should give result corresponding to one of the permitted states whereas multiple measurement should give a result corresponding to an average value .",
    "we present experimental results corresponding such measurements .",
    "photo of the asymmetric al round loop ( ring ) with semi - ring width @xmath0 , @xmath1 and magnetic dependencies of the critical current @xmath2 expected be observed on such ring at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental dependencies @xmath5 measured on this ring at @xmath6 are shown also . ]",
    "superconducting loop interrupted by one or several josephson junctions is proposed in many publications [ 4 ] as possible quantum bit , i.e. a two - state quantum system which can be used as main element of quantum computer .",
    "this proposal is based on the assumption on two permitted state in such loop with half quantum @xmath7 of magnetic flux @xmath8 .",
    "the authors [ 4 ] do not doubt that the two states exist and any observation will find a value corresponding to one of them . but nobody must be sure of anything in the quantum world till unambiguous experimental evidence .",
    "a. einstein , b. podolsky , and n. rosen were sure [ 5 ] that a process of measurement carried out on a one system can not affect other system in any way .",
    "but experimental results [ 6 ] have shown that it can and this phenomenon is called now einstein - podolsky- rosen correlation .",
    "the quantum oscillations of the critical current @xmath9 , @xmath10 measured in opposite directions and its anisotropy ( an ) @xmath11 observed on single loops with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 at ( 1 ) @xmath15 and ( 2 ) @xmath16 . ]",
    "the numerous observation of the little - parks oscillations [ 7 ] of resistance @xmath17 of superconducting loop [ 8 ] prove quantization of velocity circulation @xmath18 of superconducting pairs and that the permitted state with minimum energy has overwhelming probability even at @xmath19 . the maximum @xmath20 [ 9 ] and zero value of the rectified voltage , corresponding to the average velocity @xmath21 [ 10 ] , observed at @xmath8",
    "may be considered as an experimental evidence of two permitted states with the same minimum energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 whereas @xmath25 .",
    "but it is needed to verify that a single measurement gives a result corresponding @xmath26 or @xmath27 state .",
    "the measurement of the critical current of an asymmetric superconducting loop , fig.1 , can be used for this verification . the current density equal @xmath28 , @xmath29 in the loop halves because of the velocity quantization should mount the critical value , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , at the external current @xmath32 or @xmath33 depending on the directions of the external current @xmath34 and the persistent current @xmath35(2\\pi \\hbar / ml ) ( n -\\phi/\\phi_{0})$ ] , fig.1 .",
    "one may expect to determine not only value but also direction of the persistent current @xmath36 using the critical current @xmath2 values measured in opposite directions of asymmetric loop with unequal half sections @xmath37 , fig.1 .",
    "our measurements of aluminum rings with radius @xmath38 , thickness @xmath39 , semi - ring width @xmath0 , @xmath40 and systems of such rings at @xmath41 have shown that the whole structure jumps from superconducting to normal state at @xmath42 or @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the ring should remain in superconducting state with the same quantum number @xmath43 right up to the transition into the normal state and the measurement of @xmath42 or @xmath10 should correspond single measurement of the quantum state .",
    "one should expect gaps in the @xmath44 , @xmath45 dependencies and maximum of @xmath46 at @xmath8 , fig.1 .",
    "magnetic dependencies of ( 1 ) the resistance @xmath47 at t = 1.228 k of ( 2 ) the critical current @xmath9 , @xmath10 at t = 1.208 k , and ( 3 ) the rectified voltage @xmath48 , induced by the ac current with frequency f = 0.5 khz and amplitude @xmath49 at t = 1.209 k of 20 loops with @xmath12 , @xmath50 and @xmath14 ]    we have obtained identical @xmath44 , @xmath45 dependencies at measurements of four single rings and two systems of identical 20 rings at different temperature , fig.2,3 , which differ from the expected one , fig.1 , in essence .",
    "the magnetic dependencies of the anisotropy of the critical current @xmath11 , which should be proportional to the persistent current @xmath52 , cross zero at @xmath53 and @xmath8 , fig.2 , as well as the one of the rectified voltage @xmath54 , fig.3 , corresponding multiple , but not single , measurement of the persistent current states .",
    "it is more strange that the magnetic dependencies of the critical current measured in opposite directions are similar @xmath55 and its anisotropy results from a shift @xmath56 of these dependencies one relatively another .",
    "it is very strange that minimum of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is observed at @xmath57 and @xmath58 but not at @xmath8 as it should be expected and as it is observed in symmetrical ring [ 11 ] since the maximum of the little - parks oscillations of asymmetric rings is observed at @xmath8 .",
    "we hope that future investigations can clear a nature of this contradictions between results of measurements of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath17 .",
