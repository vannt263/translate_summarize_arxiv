    "applications of these systems include possible implementations of quantum information processing setups @xcite , and controlled nonclassical light sources @xcite as well as new possibilities for trapping and cooling of atoms and molecules .",
    "the basic physical mechanism in these setups can be traced back to the backaction of the atoms on the field .",
    "they act as a moving refractive index and absorber , modifying the intensity and phase of the intracavity field , which in turn governs their motion .",
    "this coupled dynamics is at the heart of cavity enhanced trapping and cooling .",
    "it is clear that if a single atom is able to change the field , it will influence other atoms in the same field irrespective of their distance .",
    "this introduces long range atom - atom interactions , which are widely tailorable by suitable choices of cavity geometries and operating conditions . on one hand",
    "these interactions are useful and can be used to implement bipartite quantum gates @xcite . on the other hand",
    "they play a decisive role in the scaling properties of cavity enhanced cooling @xcite . for perfectly correlated atoms , the change of refractive index induced by one atom can be compensated by a second atom , so that the effective atom - field back reaction can be strongly reduced . for several atoms in a ring cavity",
    "this effect only allows a weak damping of relative motion , while the center of mass motion is strongly damped @xcite .",
    "this model is closely related to the so - called carl laser , where the kinetic energy of an atomic beam leads to gain into the counterpropagating mode of a single side pumped ring resonator @xcite .",
    "new effects were also found in the study of the coupling of two bose - condensates in a cavity @xcite .",
    "several limiting cases for n atoms commonly interacting with a cavity mode have already been studied . for the case of n",
    "strongly trapped atoms in a standing wave cavity mode , it is possible to derive a set of coupled equations for the total kinetic and potential energy as well as the field amplitude @xcite , which exhibit collective , damped oscillations ending in highly correlated steady states .",
    "this approach , however , does not give much insight into the details of the individual dynamics and correlations . in the opposite limit of n untrapped atoms moving in the cavity field , numerical simulations show little influence of atom - atom correlations and cooling proceeds independent of the atom number @xcite for proper rescaling of the cavity parameters .",

    "this , in principle , makes it possible to study the combined optical potential and friction forces .",
    "it has been recently proposed theoretically @xcite and confirmed experimentally @xcite , that if the atoms are pumped directly from the side ( as opposed to pumping the cavity ) , the buildup of spatial correlations within a cloud of trapped atoms can lead to superradiant light scattering and enhanced cooling behavior .",
    "the theoretical results in this case are based on numerical simulations of the semiclassical equations of motion for a large number @xmath3 of particles @xcite .",
    "this clearly demonstrates collective effects , but does not give much quantitative insight in the buildup and role of atom - atom correlations .",
    "the central goal of the present work is to study the basic physical mechanisms responsible for the motional correlations and to develop quantitative measures of the established steady state correlation . for this",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest nontrivial example , namely two atoms strongly coupled to a single standing wave field of a cavity .",
    "the energy loss is compensated by cavity pumping , and large detuning from the atomic transition is taken to ensure low atomic saturation . moreover ,",
    "the motion of the atoms is only followed along the cavity axis .",

    "the internal atomic dynamics can be rewritten in the form of quantum langevin equations . for low saturation ,",
    "i.e.  when @xmath31 , we can approximate the operator @xmath32 by @xmath33 ( this is called bosonization of the atomic operators ) . the resulting heisenberg ",
    "langevin equations then reduce to the following set of coupled linear differential equations :    [ eq : bosonic_langevin ] @xmath34    the noise operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 appear as a result of the coupling to the external vacuum through the cavity mirrors and through spontaneous emission .",

    "this expression is only approximately valid : there will be a time lag in the internal dynamics with respect to the atom s current position , and hence we will include corrections to @xmath50 to first order in the atomic velocities .",
    "the slow evolution of the centers of mass of the atoms , smoothed out on the timescale @xmath51 is described by the coupled langevin equations :    [ eq : cm_motion ] @xmath52    in these equations @xmath53 are the vectors giving the steady state @xmath54 contribution of the force , while @xmath55 are the tensors describing the first order corrections to the force acting on atom @xmath20 .",

    "it is by the addition of the noise terms @xmath56 that we tailor our classical force to give the same second - order expectation values as its quantum counterpart@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) contains no direct coupling between the two atoms : these only arise indirectly due to coupling to the same field mode .",
    "interestingly the atom - atom interaction appears in all the three types of forces present in classical equations of motion ( [ eq : cm_motion ] ) .",
    "first , the steady state force @xmath60 depends on the positions of both atoms via the steady state intensity .",
    "second , not only does the friction coefficient on one atom depend on the position of the other , but the friction matrix has off - diagonal terms as well .",
    "this means that apart from ordinary viscous friction ( @xmath61 ) a strange phenomenon , which we call cross - friction ( @xmath62 , for @xmath63 ) is also present . here",
    "the velocity of one atom influences the friction experienced by the other atom .",
    "third , the langevin noise term on one atom has an expected magnitude influenced by the position of the other , and the noise terms @xmath56 are directly correlated as well .",
    "hence we get joint `` kicks '' on both atoms leading to correlated motion . in the following",
    "we will analyze these interaction channels in more detail .",
    "formally the expectation value @xmath65 of the force operator looks very similar to the case of free - space doppler cooling : @xmath66 however it additionally depends on the positions of the other atoms via the cavity field intensity .",
    "this dipole force is conservative and can be derived from a potential .",
    "the potential looks more complicated than in free space as it contains the dynamical nature of the cavity field , but still can be given in closed form @xcite : @xmath67    to show the effects of dynamic field adjustment , we plot this potential for two typical cases in fig .  [",
    "fig : potentials ] . for the experimental parameters used in an experiment at mpq in garching @xcite ( garching parameters ) , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and for a detuning @xmath70 ( upper graph )",
    "the effective interaction between the atoms is relatively weak and the potential resembles the familiar `` egg - carton '' surface proportional to @xmath71 . for a somewhat stronger atom - field coupling @xmath72 ( lower graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials ] ) the atomic interaction is quite obvious and the shape of the potential of the second atom strongly depends on the position of the first atom and vice versa . basically in this second case either both atoms are trapped , or both are free .",
    "the peculiar @xmath73-dependence of the interaction and the trapping effects can be understood physically by looking at formula ( [ eq : cavity_pumping_force ] ) .",
    "the atoms see each other through the cavity field @xmath74 . as we saw in formulae ( [ eq : rezonancia_d],[eq : u0_def],[eq : gamma0_def ] ) , the field is in resonance when @xmath75 is approximately @xmath76 .",
    "each atom can shift @xmath77 in this far - detuned case by approximately @xmath78 , whereas the cavity linewidth is approximately @xmath79 . using the mpq parameters @xmath80 , and",
    "therefore the back - action of the atoms on the cavity field is weak . in the large-@xmath73 case , @xmath81 , but @xmath82 ,",
    "meaning that the atoms can shift the cavity resonance significantly more than a linewidth .",
    "hence if one of the atoms leaves its trap it will shift the cavity out of resonance and cause the other atom to be released as well .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the force is proportional to the cavity field , which in the large-@xmath73 case decreases faster with the distance from the trapping point .",
    "this implies that less work needs to be done to free an atom : the potential is smaller , despite the same maximum light shift .    )",

    "we start from the limiting case of neglecting the atomic back - action on the field ( i.e.  we assume a constant field intensity ) .",
    "this corresponds to the force @xmath83 one obtains in the limit of very large atom - field detuning .",
    "we can now find corrections from the cavity - mediated interaction to this force by expanding the potential in a power series .",

    "the corrections to this are given by terms of higher order in our expansion parameter , of which we give the first nontrivial term here .",
    "note that since it is not simply the distance of the atoms upon which the potential depends , the interatomic force between them  as can be read out from the above formula  is not a `` force '' in the sense of newton s third law .",
    "to lowest order in the adiabatic separation of the internal and external dynamics we used the steady state values of the internal variables for fixed positions of the atoms to calculate the above potentials . as a next step",
    "we can include corrections for @xmath39 and the @xmath18 linear in the velocity @xmath87 of each atom , which should be valid for low velocities .",
    "as described in @xcite this leads to a friction matrix @xmath55 as first order correction to @xmath88 .",
    "we obtain the following explicit formula for the friction matrix , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a complex factor of unit modulus , which for large atomic detuning , @xmath91 , becomes approximately @xmath92 .",
    "this formula differs somewhat from that obtained by fischer et al .",
    "@xcite by a slightly different approach .",
    "the most important difference is that we find a matrix _ symmetric _ in the indices @xmath93 .",
    "this is important because it is these off - diagonal terms that couple the velocities of the atoms , and have a decisive influence on the buildup of correlated motion .",
    "we defer detailed discussion of the formula to section [ sec : analytical ] .",
    "spontaneous emission and cavity decay introduce quantum noise into the atomic motion .",
    "these heat up the system and generally tend to decrease motional correlations of the atoms .",
    "following the line of reasoning briefly mentioned at the end of section [ sect : themodel ] and discussed in more detail in @xcite , we can calculate the influence of the noise operators @xmath35 and @xmath94 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bosonic_langevin ] ) on the dynamics . for @xmath4 atoms we arrive at the following simple formula :",
    "@xmath95 this is a simple extension of the corresponding formula for one atom given in @xcite .",
    "let us remark here , that the diagonal part of this diffusion matrix @xmath96 has been also found by fischer et al .",
    "surprisingly one also obtains off - diagonal terms , which have not been considered before . these terms lead to correlated kicks on the atoms , which can .add to the atom - atom correlations , rather than destroying them .",
    "spontaneous emission adds recoil noise , which gives an extra term to the noise correlation matrix of the form : @xmath97 here @xmath25 is the expected wavenumber of the emitted photons and @xmath98 is the correction factor coming from the spatial distribution of the photons , in our case @xmath99 .",
    "as expected , spontaneous emission , being a single - atom process , induces no correlations between the atoms .",
    "having discussed the qualitative nature of the combined atom field dynamics , we now turn to numerical simulations for some quantitative answers .",
    "we numerically integrate the langevin equations ( [ eq : cm_motion ] ) , varying the ratio of the cavity loss rate to the linewidth of the atom @xmath100 as well as the relative coupling strength @xmath101 .",
    "note that the relative magnitude of radiation pressure and dipole force can be changed by varying the detuning between pump frequency and the atomic resonance . as we are interested in cooling and trapping the atoms we fix the cavity frequency at @xmath102 to ensure efficient cooling @xcite . the pump power is always chosen to keep the atomic saturation low and approximately at ( @xmath103 ) at all times .",

    "the correlation established between two atoms results in a loss of efficiency of cavity cooling , with final temperatures pushed up to the doppler limit .",
    "as we have seen above , the motion of the atoms becomes correlated due to the cavity - mediated cross - talk .",
    "this interaction occurs via the force , via the friction , and via the diffusion as well .",
    "we would like to know which of these interaction channels is responsible for the correlation . in our simulation we can conveniently answer this question if we artificially weaken only particular channels of interaction and measure the correlation .",

    "cross - friction is seen to play the dominant role in the establishment of correlation .",
    "[ fig : korr_mesterseges ] , width=264 ]    the results of these investigations are quite unanimous .",
    "it can be seen that linearization of the potential has no systematic effect on correlation strength , and correlations are slightly enhanced if the noise is decorrelated .",
    "if cross - friction is eliminated , however , all correlations disappear .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the dominant effect leading to correlated motion is related to cross - friction .",
    "the emergence of motional correlations between trapped atoms can be examined analytically using the formulas presented in section [ sec : interaction ] .",
    "both friction and diffusion matrices have an `` isotropic '' term proportional to @xmath157 , which acts on each atom separately , and an `` interaction '' term , containing cross - friction and cross - diffusion .",
    "the latter can be rewritten in the following form , using the notation @xmath158 : @xmath159 where the prefactor @xmath160 depends on the positions of all atoms symmetrically .    for well - trapped atoms @xmath161 ( @xmath162 denoting the distance of atom @xmath20 from the nearest trapping site ) , the coupling constants can be approximated as @xmath163 substituting these into the interaction parts of the matrices yields : @xmath164 where the `` radius '' , @xmath165 , is the distance of the system from the origin in the coordinate space .",
    "this matrix is a projector to the vector @xmath166 , and hence the interaction terms affect only the `` radial '' motion .    in the well - trapped case we can write the friction and diffusion matrices to second order in the coordinates @xmath167 as : @xmath168 the following notation is used : @xmath169 \\right\\ } , \\\\",

    "this prevents the atoms from stopping completely : they are `` heated out '' from the trapping sites themselves . at some distance from the trapping sites",
    "the interaction terms become important as well , in the coordinate space this induces extra diffusion and friction in the radial direction .",
    "provided @xmath73 is high enough , radial friction is enhanced much more than radial diffusion , leading to a `` freezing out '' of the radial mode , i.e.  a motion at approximately constant distance from the origin .",
    "as pointed out in several previous papers , the motion of particles in a cavity is coupled quite generally through the field mode .",
    "this implies the buildup of motional correlations , which we have investigated here in more detail .",
    "in general we found that in steady state these correlations are hard to see directly and it is difficult to find good qualitative measures to characterize them .",
    "mostly they are strongly perturbed by various diffusion mechanisms .",
    "however , they still play an important role in the dynamics and thus can be observed indirectly .",
    "as one consequence they can lead to a significant change ( increase ) in the steady temperature , which directly relates to trapping times and localization properties .",
    "this poses limits to cavity induced cooling for large particle numbers .    from the various mechanisms at work , cross - friction turns out to be the most important .",
    "it creates correlation and leads to a fast thermalization of two distant particles without direct interaction .",
    "hence , this mechanism should prove vital for the implementation of sympathetic cooling of distant ensembles coupled by a far off - resonant cavity field . in order to get efficient coupling",
    "the two species should have comparable oscillation frequencies , so that correlation buildup and thermalization is fast .",
    "the finesse of the cavity should also be large ( long photon lifetime ) .",
    "the second important coupling mechanism , which works via the joint steady state potentials , was suggested for use in the implementation of conditional phase shifts @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a cavity - enhanced dipole  dipole coupling .",
    "although this contribution will become more important for larger atom - field detunings , the conditions for this part to dominate the dissipative cross - friction seem rather hard to achieve in practice .",
    "finally we found that the noise forces acting on different atoms contain nonlocal correlations too .",
    "these are particularly important for large detunings and relatively low photon numbers , where spontaneous emission is strongly reduced . as a result they could seriously perturb bipartite quantum gates in cavities .",
