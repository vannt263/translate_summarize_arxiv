    "microarray gene expression experiments help in the measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously .",
    "such data help in diagnosing various types of tumors with better accuracy .",
    "the fact that this process generates a lot of complex data happens to be its major limitation .",
    "normally the number of genes ( features ) is much greater than the number of samples ( instances ) in a microarray gene expression dataset .",
    "such structures pose problems to machine learning and make the problem of classification difficult to solve .",
    "this is mainly because , out of thousands of genes , most of the genes do not contribute to the classification process . as a result gene subset selection acquires extreme importance towards the construction of efficient classifiers with high predictive accuracy .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "one way is to select a small subset of informative genes from the data .",
    "this technique which is known as _ gene selection _ or _ feature selection _ helps in tackling overfitting by getting rid of noisy genes , reducing the computational load and in increasing the overall classification performance of the learning models .",
    "gene selection algorithms are mainly categorized as : wrappers and filters .",
    "wrappers make use of learning algorithms to estimate the quality or suitability of genes to the modelling problem .",
    "optimization algorithms in combination with various classifiers fall into this category as described in @xcite . on the other hand , filters",
    "@xcite evaluate the genes considering their inherent characteristics without making use of a learning algorithm .",
    "filters , therefore , give an insight into the properties of the dataset we use .",
    "algorithms based on statistical tests and mutual information are some examples of filters .",
    "this paper presents hybrid bbo rf and hybrid bbo svm approaches for simultaneous informative gene selection and high performance classification .",
    "additionally , for enhancing performance we provide information gain gene ranking as heuristic knowledge to our bbo algorithm .",
    "it traverses the enormously large search space by using this ranking information to iteratively obtain informative gene subsets .",
    "the selected subsets of genes ( candidate solutions ) in each generation are subsequently evaluated by svm and random forests cv ( cross validation ) accuracies .",
    "biogeography is the study of geographical distribution of species over geological period of time .",
    "biological literature on the same is massive . in 2008 , for the first time , simon @xcite applied the biogeography analogy to the idea of engineering optimization and thus introduced the biogeographybased optimization ( bbo ) technique .",
    "it is a population based method that works with a collection of candidate solutions over generations .",
    "it attempts to explore the combinatorially large solution spaces with a stochastic approach like many other evolutionary algorithms @xcite .",
    "it mimics the geographical distribution of species to represent the problem and its candidate solutions in the search space , subsequently using the process of species migration and mutation to redistribute solution instances across the search space in quest of globally optimal or near optimal solutions .",
    "bbo , as is or in variations , has been explored for various combinatorial and constrained / unconstrained optimization problems @xcite including the likes of the traveling salesman problem @xcite , satellite image classification @xcite and sensor selection @xcite among others . but",
    "as of 2012 , no work is reported of using bbo as a gene selection technique for microarray gene expression data analysis .",
    "we attempt to study bbo for gene selection and classification in this work .    in bbo",
    ", there exists an ecosystem ( population ) which in turn consists of a number of habitats ( islands ) .",
    "each habitat has a _ habitat suitability index _ ( hsi ) , which is similar to a fitness function and depends on many features / attributes of the island .",
    "if a value is assigned to each feature , then the hsi of a habitat _",
    "h _ is a function of these values .",
    "these variables characterizing a habitat s suitability collectively form the _ suitability index variables _ ( sivs ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0    for the problem of gene selection , the sivs of a habitat ( candidate solution ) are the selected subsets of genes out of the set of all genes .",
    "the ecosystem is therefore a random collection of candidate gene subsets .",
    "a good solution is thus analogous to a good hsi and _ vice versa_. good hsi solutions tend to share sivs with poor hsi solutions .",
    "this form of sharing , termed as migration , is controlled by emigration and immigration rates of the habitats .",
    "we have purposely kept the model simple and have obeyed the original simple linear model for migration as shown in figure [ fig_sim ] .        where e and i are the maximum emigration and immigration rates , both typically set to 1 .",
    "the individual immigration and emigration rates ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ) are calculated by the same formulae for this simple linear model as in @xcite .",
    "@xmath3    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the iterator for the @xmath6 habitats .",
    "we present our bbo algorithm for performing gene selection . for our problem",
    ", we treat a gene ( identified by gene number ) as an siv for a habitat and each habitat has @xmath7 sivs ( arity @xmath7 as _ habitat _ @xmath8 ) .",
    "for example , if a habitat is @xmath9 then the sivs 12 , 345 ,  , 141 are the selected gene numbers out of say a collection of 500 genes and the subset size is 5 genes .",
    "the tuned parameter values for our algorithm are given in the next section .",
    "the bbo gene selection algorithm is stated .",
    "initialize bbo parameters initialize @xmath10 with randomly generated @xmath6 habitats evaluate habitats : calculate the hsi of each habitat in the @xmath10 _ ( cross validation accuracies of each gene subset from a classifier ) _",
    "compute @xmath11 and @xmath12 for each @xmath13 based on its hsi perform @xmath14 perform @xmath15 re - evaluate @xmath10 perform @xmath16 output the habitat with best hsi and its sivs ( selected genes ) .    at each migration or mutation , we ensure that a gene is not duplicated within a single subset of genes , _",
    "i.e. _ within a single habitat . the subset sizes ( the variable @xmath7 ) can be set during each run of the bbo algorithm .",
    "the ecosystem then has habitats all with same number of sivs .",
    "this selection of subset size is predecided and can be tuned manually by running bbo for various subset sizes .",
    "@xmath17 : the migration procedure of the original bbo algorithm @xcite is retained .",
    "we produce the algorithm here for the purpose of completeness .",
    "select @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 @xmath11 select @xmath20 with probability @xmath19 @xmath12 randomly select an siv @xmath21 from @xmath20 replace a random siv in @xmath18 with @xmath21    _ mutation with information gain based gene ranking _ : given the vast search space formed by the possible genes , we keep the mutation rate to about 0.4 to 0.55 in order to graze other portions of this space with a good chance .",
    "we have used information gain heuristics as the additional information during mutation .",
    "information gain _",
    "( ig ) @xcite of a gene is a measure of attribute selection .",
    "it stores the information contentof a gene with respect to the problem under consideration .",
    "the ig of a gene indicates the capability to separate instances for binary classification .",
    "we are specially interested in the non - zero ig values .",
    "thus we partition the informative and non - informative genes into separate sets . for ig computation , we have used weka @xcite data mining software suite , which outputs the information gain based ranking of genes .",
    "this is fed to bbo for further computations .",
    "this informative gene set with non - zero infogain values are introduced in the population during the process of mutation .",
    "while in mutation , our algorithm either randomly explores newer genes or exploits from the available set of genes with non - zero infogain values .",
    "we set a user defined exploitation probability @xmath22 .",
    "this exploitation is done in a probabilistic manner as analogous with the exploration and exploitation in ant colony optimization @xcite . to give an example",
    ", we have a total of 30 expressed genes and only the first 8 out of these 30 genes have a non - zero infogain . assuming rand <",
    "@xmath22 is satisfied ( step 5 of algorithm 3 ) , then we select one out of these 8 genes , with a probability proportional to the information gain ranking scores , to be newly put in @xmath13 in place of an existing one . while on the other hand if rand <",
    "@xmath22 did not get satisfied , we execute the * _ else _ * part ( step 7 and 8) @xmath23 randomly select a gene from all of the 30 genes expressed in the data .",
    "algorithm 3 gives the detailed mutation algorithm .",
    "use @xmath11 , @xmath12 of habitat @xmath18 to compute the probability @xmath24 select siv(gene ) @xmath25 with probability @xmath19 @xmath24 _ exploit _ : replace @xmath25 with a probabilistically selected a siv ( gene ) from the rest ( using their information gain ) _ explore _ : replace @xmath25 with a random siv ( gene ) out of the rest    @xmath26 : we implement elitism so that the best solutions obtained until a particular generation do not get corrupted .",
    "support vector machines ( svms ) @xcite were originally introduced by vapnik and co - workers @xcite and successively extended by a number of other researchers .",
    "svm employs a maximum margin linear hyperplane for solving binary linear classification problems . for non - linearly separable problems ,",
    "svm first transforms the data into a higher dimensional feature and subsequently employs a linear hyperplane . to deal with computational intractability issues",
    "it further uses appropriate kernel functions facilitating all computations in the input space itself .",
    "vapnik et al . in @xcite",
    "have themselves used svm with recursive feature elimination ( rfe ) for gene selection and achieved notably high accuracy levels .",
    "we discuss more about results in the subsequent section .    for our purposes we employ the libsvm @xcite library for evaluation of our candidate solutions during each generation .",
    "random forests ( rf ) were first introduced by breimen and cutler @xcite .",
    "it is an ensemble of randomly constructed independent decision trees .",
    "it performs substantially better than single - tree classifiers such as cart @xcite and c4.5 @xcite .",
    "a random subset of attributes are used for node splitting while growing each decision tree .",
    "normally , for each tree , a bootstrap set ( with replacement ) is drawn from the original training data , @xmath23 an instance is picked from the training data and is replaced again before drawing the next instance .",
    "likewise , @xmath6 such instances are taken to form in bagset for a particular tree .",
    "for each of the bootstrap training sets , about one third of the samples , on an average , are unused for making the in bagdata and are called the out of bag(oob ) data for that particular tree .",
    "the classification tree is built with this in bagdata using the cart algorithm @xcite .",
    "separate test data is not required in rf for checking the overall accuracy of the forest .",
    "the oob data is used for cross validation .",
    "when all the trees are grown , the @xmath27 tree classifies the samples that are oob for that tree ( left out by the @xmath27 tree ) . in this manner , each instance is classified by about one third of the trees .",
    "a majority vote is then taken to decide on the class label for each case .",
    "the percentage of times that the voted class label is not equal to the original class of a sample , averaged over all the cases in the training data , is called as the oob error rate @xcite .",
    "we have used the randomforest package in @xmath28 for implementation purposes @xcite .",
    "the output of microarray experiments are the expression levels of different genes .",
    "three such datasets were obtained from the kent ridge biomedical datasets repository@xcite and libsvm repository @xcite ( made available from various other original sources ) .    the colon cancer dataset retrieved from the kent ridge biomedical dataset repository consists of 62 instances representing cell samples taken from colon cancer patients . among these , 40 are tumor samples while 22 otherwise @xcite .",
    "the breast cancer dataset is retrieved from the duke breast cancer spore frozen tissue bank @xcite .",
    "of the 44 samples we worked with , each sample with expressions for 7129 genes , 22 belong to class a ( estrogen receptor - positive er@xmath29 ) while 22 belong to class b ( estrogen receptor - negative er@xmath30 ) .",
    "the leukemia dataset @xcite also retrieved from the kent ridge biomedical dataset repository contains the expression of 7129 genes .",
    "these are total 72 samples taken from leukemia patients out of which 25 belong to the acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) class and 47 belong to the acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) class .",
    "these specifications are tabulated in table i.    .dataset specifications [ cols=\"<,^,^ , > \" , ]     with reference to literature , bbo - svm and bbo - rf have fared well as compared to the previously best performing algorithms ( for the same colon cancer dataset ) namely svmrfe - rg @xcite , fisher - rg - svmrfe @xcite , aco - am ( ant colony optimizationant miner ) and aco - rf @xcite which had demonstrated accuracies of 93.3 , 94.7 , 95.47 and 96.77% respectively @xcite .",
    "similarly , the best performing algorithms for leukemia cancer classification have shown accuracies in the range 9197% , with the best being 97.06% @xcite .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite have worked with the same dataset for aml / all classification , @xcite and @xcite have worked with a different dataset ( for diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) ) but with similar properties , which makes us believe that our proposed algorithm with gene selection will also perform equally well as in aml / all classification . in case of breast cancer ,",
    "the reported accuracies , for the dataset we have worked with , have been in the range of 9194%@xcite . very clearly , our method of using bbo for gene selection in combination with svm and rf has outperformed them with accuracies as shown in table [ table3_size_accuracy ] .",
    "it is worth to note that the methods in literature have almost always reported their best accuracies . in our work , we have reported the average accuracies for both , bbosvm and bborf .",
    "the hybrid bbo - svm and bbo - rf techniques have shown consistently good results when compared against the highest accuracies for colon cancer , breast cancer and leukemia cancer datasets .",
    "like other evolutionary algorithms , they are also simple to implement , robust and flexible since we can have various possible alternatives as suited to the problem and domain constraints . a significant speedup in the algorithm may be achieved by parallel implementations where the classification accuracies for individual candidate solutions may be computed in parallel .",
    "like all eas , our hybrid methods spur many possibilities of future work some problem dependent and some from the implementation perspective . from problem representation to specific migration and mutation strategies , we can have a variety of schemes .",
    "for example , with respect to problem representation , the other suitable scheme that one could explore for bbo here is : each habitat of the ecosystem could have an arbitrary number of attributes ( sivs ) which remains fixed for itself across generations but may differ from other habitats in the ecosystem .",
    "this is similar to the variable population sizes proposed earlier for bbo @xcite and other eas @xcite but at a finer granularity , variable solution ( habitats or chromosomes as the case may be ) sizes .",
    "this could lead us to a compact implementation framework that can simultaneously output the better performing subset sizes along with the selected genes .",
    "many such variations possible with other eas could work here too .",
