    "graphene has been attracting the interest of the wider scientific community due to its potential for applications in fields as diverse as photonics , sensor technology , and spintronics.@xcite spintronics is a particularly promising field for graphene application due to the weak spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions , which in other materials act as significant sources of spin relaxation and decoherence.@xcite    one recurrent topic in the field of spintronics is the mechanism of interaction between localized magnetic moments embedded in nanoscale systems .",
    "an indirect exchange interaction mediated by the conduction electrons of a host medium manifests as an energy difference between different alignments of the localized moments .",
    "such an interaction is usually calculated within the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) approximation@xcite , and the interaction itself frequently takes this name.@xcite    the rkky interaction in graphene has been intensively studied .",
    "@xcite the consensus from these studies is that the interaction strength decays asymptotically as @xmath0 in undoped graphene , where @xmath1 is the separation between magnetic moments .",
    "this decay rate is faster than the @xmath2 decay expected for conventional two - dimensional materials and arises from the vanishing density of states at the fermi energy in graphene.@xcite the usual sign - changing oscillations predicted for such interactions are masked by the coincidence of the fermi surface and brillouin zone .",
    "this causes the sign of the coupling - which determines the ferromagnetic ( fm ) or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) alignment of the moments - within the rkky interaction to only depend on whether the two moments occupy the same or opposite sublattices , and not on their separation .",
    "when graphene is doped or gated such that the fermi surface no longer coincides with the brillouin zone , sign - changing oscillations are recovered and the interaction is found to decay as @xmath2 .    some studies have extended the discussion to include center - adsorbed impurities and bridge - adsorbed impurities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "center - adsorbed impurities ( often called plaquette or ` hollow - site ' impurities ) consist of an impurity atom located at the center of a hexagon in the graphene lattice , connected symmetrically to the six surrounding carbon atoms . bridge - adsorbed impurities ( often called bond impurities ) consist of an impurity atom located above the bond between two adjacent carbon atoms in the graphene lattice , connected symmetrically to both .",
    "these types of adsorption are of particular interest since they are energetically favourable for many transition - metal atoms , with the majority preferring the center - adsorbed configuration.@xcite there is some discrepancy in the literature about the basic features of the interaction between center - adsorbed impurities .",
    "some studies suggest an interaction which is always afm and decays as @xmath0 ( the same decay rate predicted for substitutional ) while others suggest a decay rate of @xmath3 with a fm interaction at some separations.@xcite this discrepancy is similar to the related case of carbon nanotubes , where center - adsorbed impurities are predicted to display a decay rate of @xmath4 instead of @xmath5 found for substitutional impurities .",
    "@xcite    recent interest in the strain engineering of graphene is motivated by the high degree of tunability that can be achieved by varying the strength and type of mechanical strain applied.@xcite the ability of graphene to sustain reversible deformations of up to approximately 20% @xcite suggests that even simple uniaxial strains may provide opportunities to tune the electronic , magnetic , optical and thermal properties of graphene systems .",
    "strain has recently been predicted to significantly modify features of the interaction between substitutional magnetic moments embedded in graphene.@xcite due to the number of transition - metal atoms that adsorb in either the center or bridge configurations , and the different features observed for these configurations , it is worth expanding this previous work to predict the effects of strain on the interactions between adsorbed impurities . since a range of effects",

    "a combination of these features is reported as each separation consists of an armchair and zigzag component . due to the extremely rapid rates of decay , the interaction between center - adsorbed magnetic impurities is essentially zero for any reasonable separation above a few lattice spacings .",
    "a similar increase in the decay rate has been noted previously for center - adsorbed impurities in carbon nanotubes , but the decay rate here is even more rapid.@xcite this result would appear to have serious negative implications for spintronic devices aiming to exploit rkky - like interactions between transition - metal adsorbates in graphene .",
    "we note that although our model assumes equal hopping parameters between the magnetic impurity and the six surrounding carbon atoms , it can be easily shown that the fast decay rate will result as long as the hopping terms to sites on the same sublattices are equivalent .",

    "the use of a composite green function , @xmath182 , was shown to allow for a computationally efficient calculation of this interaction in both strained and unstrained cases .",
    "specifically , we have shown that the rkky interaction between adsorbed magnetic moments in graphene depends on the exact adsorption configuration of the impurities , decaying with separation @xmath1 as @xmath3 for center - adsorbed impurities and @xmath0 for bridge - adsorbed impurities , with bridge - adsorbed impurities also displaying a sign changing behaviour as a function of separation in the zigzag direction . using our prescription , the decay , along with other features of the interaction ,",
    "may be derived in a mathematically transparent fashion .",
    "we have also shown , analytically and numerically , that mechanical strain modifies the rkky interaction .",
    "symmetry breaking of the hexagonal lattice by uniaxial strain leads to a significantly slower decay rate between center - adsorbed impurities ( @xmath0 ) , which introduces the possibility of dramatically amplifying the interaction between them .",
    "bridge - adsorbed impurities separated along certain directions alternate between ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic coupling as a function of separation and applied uniaxial strain introduces further sign changing features .",
    "such strain dependent behaviour suggests the intriguing possibility of selectively tuning the coupling between moments .    since a whole range of physical features , such as magnetotransport and overall magnetic moment formation ,",
    "are predicated upon the magnetic coupling , it is hoped that this work will help clarify some the discrepancies in the literature .",
