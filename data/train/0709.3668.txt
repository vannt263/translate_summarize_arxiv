    "this is an enormous suppression and we expect the picture derived on the assumption of exact zero modes to still hold true",
    ". exceptions could occur if a loop shrinks and becomes small , or where a cusp occurs on a loop .",
    "for the case of superconducting strings @xcite , the small but non - zero energy of the lowest positive energy state means that charge carriers now have to jump from the dirac sea to positive energy , requiring @xmath185 energy , where @xmath186 is the mass of the lowest positive energy state .",

    "the critical value of the electric field for unsuppressed pair production",
    "is @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the electric charge of the fermion .",
    "another setting where fermion zero modes are believed to play an important role is in brane cosmology where fermions are trapped on 3 + 1 dimensional branes in a higher dimensional bulk universe .",
    "if the fermions have zero modes in the brane background , it corresponds to massless fermions that are trapped on the brane and this is a possible explanation for massless standard model fermions living in a 3 dimensional space . in light of our results , if the brane can be thought of as a domain wall , in addition to the fermion zero modes , we may also expect other bound states to exist for a range of parameters .",
    "if the brane is closed or the bulk contains neighboring antibranes , the fermion zero modes will become bound states with an exponentially small mass .",
    "this may either be viewed as an undesirable feature of the particular brane system , or else may be viewed as a means to probe brane configurations in the bulk via the properties of standard model fermions .",
