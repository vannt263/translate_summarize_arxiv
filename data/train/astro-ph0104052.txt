    "during recent years spatially resolved observations of decaying radioactive isotopes spread in the interstellar medium of the milky way by their characteristic @xmath1-ray emission became feasible .",
    "the compton telescope comptel @xcite aboard nasa s compton gamma - ray observatory surveyed the sky in the mev regime during it s 9 year mission time .",
    "one of the key results of this mission was the generation of the first all sky image in the 1.809 mev @xmath1-ray line from radioactive @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the comptel observations confirm a integral @xmath0 content of the milky way of 2 to @xmath2 . in principle @xmath0",
    "can be produced by various nucleosynthesis sites .",
    "since it s first detection by heao - c @xcite non - explosive sites such as agb stars @xcite and wolf - rayet stars @xcite as well as explosive environments ( novae @xcite and core - collapse supernovae @xcite ) are discussed as possible source candidates for interstellar @xmath0 .",
    "+ the reconstructed @xmath1-ray intensity distribution correlates best with tracers of massive stars such as thermal free - free emission from the ionised medium @xcite . due to its long lifetime freshly released @xmath0 travels quite some distances until its final decay .",
    "therefore the 1.809 mev line emission is rather diffusive and it was not possible to observe isolated candidate sources .",
    "@xmath3 velorum , which is the nearest wolf - rayet star , is the only possible source for which significant upper limits on the 1.8 mev flux could be extracted so far @xcite . because of the close correlation between the galactic distribution of massive stars and the observed 1.8 mev intensity pattern , aggregations of massive stars such as young open clusters and ob associations seem to be suitable laboratories to study these candidate sources .",
    "in particular , the by combined analysis of the measured 1.8 mev intensity together with observables in other wavelength bands one may gain insight in the physical processes involved .",
    "massive stars not only eject freshly synthesised material into the surrounding ism but also impart a huge amount of kinetic energy by stellar winds and their subsequent core - collapse supernovae . furthermore they affect the state of the interstellar medium by emitting a large fraction of their electromagnetic radiation in the photoionizing extreme ultra - violet regime",
    ". therefore correlations between the @xmath1-ray line emission of @xmath0 and observables being related to one or the other phenomenon of massive stars are expected .",
    "+ we make use of a detailed population synthesis model in combination with an 1-dimensional thin shell expansion model of evolving superbubbles to study the time evolution of the different emission parameters and their resultant observables . in the following sections we present the model and discuss the predictions and their uncertainties in detail .",
    "finally , we apply the model to ob associations in the cygnus region and discuss the results for the expected @xmath0 content of this area .",
    "@xmath0 is synthesised via proton capture onto @xmath4 and therefore is a secondary product of the cno - cycle in massive stars .",
    "the efficient production of @xmath0 requires temperatures of at least @xmath5 , which are reached by stars initially more massive than @xmath6 .",
    "the production rate increases as the core temperature approaches values of @xmath7 and depends strongly on the initial metallicity of the stellar material @xcite . during later burning stages @xmath0 is produced by proton captures of secondary protons onto freshly synthesised @xmath4 .",
    "the main destruction channels at temperatures below 220 kev are the @xmath8-decay and subsequently proceeding reactions with @xmath0 as input whereas for the late burning phases the direct decay of the isomeric form of @xmath0 which is 220 kev above the ground - state destroys the remaining 26al very efficiently .",
    "the internal mixing processes bring freshly synthesised @xmath0 into areas of the massive star which will be expelled by the strong stellar winds during the of- and wr - phases .",
    "meynet et al .",
    "@xcite computed a stellar evolution grid with detailed nucleosynthesis of @xmath0 .",
    "their yields could be sufficiently well described by a power - law fit , which is used in our population synthesis model to describe the @xmath0 release of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the uncertainties in the description of the mixing processes , stellar rotation and mass loss give raise to uncertainties in the expected yields of factors up to 3 .",
    "+ beside wolf - rayet stars core - collapse supernovae are demonstrated to be efficient sources of interstellar @xmath0 @xcite . in these events @xmath0",
    "is produced by hydrostatic and explosive ne - burning as well as the @xmath9-process .",
    "whereas for the mass range below @xmath10 detailed explosive nucleosynthesis models exist , which cover a wide range of input physics including different mixing schemes and stellar rotation , for type ib / c supernovae this aspect is rather unexplored .",
    "the typical type ii yields are fit reasonably well by a power - law .",
    "in contrast , the convergence of the core - masses for the most massive stars lead to the assumption of a non - mass - dependent 26al yield , which is supported by the findings of woosley et al . @xcite . as in the case of the wr contribution",
    "the theoretical uncertainties give raise to an inaccuracy of a factor 2 to 3 .",
    "in addition , core - collapse supernovae release a large amount of radioactive @xmath11 , which migth be observed by the @xmath1-ray lines of its daughter nucleus @xmath12 at 1.173 and 1.332 mev . due to its solely production by supernovae and the longer lifetime , which reduces the intensity of the expected @xmath1-rays , the ironlines are still undetected so far .",
    "nevertheless , the ejection of @xmath11 is included in our population synthesis model .",
    "+    [ fig1 ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of interstellar content of @xmath0 for an ob association assuming an instantaneous starburst with salpeter - imf .",
    "the resulting time profile is convolution of the mass spectrum and the mass- and time - dependent ejection rates of @xmath0 taking the radioactive decay into account .",
    "the profile shows the typical two - peaked structure , where the first peak is due to the wr contribution and the second originates from the sn activity .",
    "usually ob associations have limited population statistics , leaving the observer with a poor sampling of the initial mass spectrum .",
    "a monte carlo version of our population synthesis code allows the estimation of the uncertainties introduced by this effect .",
    "our finding is , that for populations being initially richer than 100 stars more massive than @xmath13 , the resulting time profiles are dominated by theoretical uncertainties instead of statistical effects .",
    "+ an additional source of uncertainty is a possible contribution to the interstellar @xmath0 content by peculiar massive close binaries .",
    "langer et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that some of these systems may give raise to a large overproduction of @xmath0 in the supernova explosion of secondary .",
    "their contribution may be enhanced by factors up to 1000 . up to now , it is not possible to really incorporate these effects in a population synthesis model due to a lack of a detailed investigation of the appropriate parameter space .",
    "therefore we have to leave this as open question",
    ".      a well known phenomenon of massive stars is their very strong stellar wind imparting a fairly large amount of kinetic energy to the ism .",
    "in addition , their subsequent supernova explosions release on a very short time - scale even larger amounts of energy to the ism . in ob associations these effects can be expected to overlap and serve as an energy source for blowing large - scale gas structures , known as superbubbles , into the surrounding ism .",
    "our population synthesis model predicts the flux of kinetic energy as well as matter due to an underlying massive star population .",
    "the stellar wind part is modelled using the semi - empirical mass loss rates from the geneva stellar evolution models @xcite in combination with a semi - analytical wind velocity formula from prinja and colleagues @xcite .",
    "the energy released by a single supernova is assumed to be @xmath14 per event . by using a similar scheme as for the nucleosynthesis part",
    "our population synthesis model predicts the integral flux of energy and matter from an association .",
    "+ the integral wind power as well as the flux of matter can only be observed by their impact on the surrounding ism , therefore we used the results from our population synthesis model as input for an 1-dimensional , numerical model of an expanding supershell .",
    "the model is based on the thin shell approximation and incorporates radiative cooling as well as a parameterised description of evaporation from the inner shell or cloudlets which passed the shock and made it into the hot bubble medium .",
    "our description of a possible evaporative poisoning as it was labelled by shull & saken @xcite aims on a study of the relevance of this process and uses two parameters , which are the transmission efficiency @xmath15 and the evaporation time - scale @xmath16 . depending on the ambient density and",
    "pressure evaporation becomes critical for quite low transmission efficiencies of the order of few thousands relative to the swept up mass sitting in the thin shell .",
    "this is especially true if the evaporation time - scale is short .",
    "if the bubble medium reaches a critical density at sufficiently low temperatures of some @xmath17 the interior energy of the bubble is converted into radiation and the bubble medium is cold down to some @xmath18 rather immediately .",
    "if the evaporation time - scale is long compared with the dynamic time - scales then the transmission of some fractions of the ambient medium reduces the mass of the shell at a given time and the bubble expansion stays faster than in cases where no material is transmitted through the shell . in",
    "this cases the bubbles become larger .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the ratio of the observable kinetic energy of an expanding supershell relative to the kinetic energy from source . in this case",
    "intermediate values have been chosen for the evaporation parameters .",
    "[ fig2 ]     + during the early phase the ratio approaches the canonical value of 20 - 25% rather quickly , whereas after approximately 15 myr the ratio drops significantly and approaches values of 5% or less in the late phase .",
    "this behaviour depends strongly on the chosen parameter set for the environment as well as evaporation process .",
    "if evaporation is efficiently suppressed due to magnetic fields or some other processes the ratio stays near 20% over the whole evolution .",
    "but , the critical parameter range for efficient cooling and subsequently stalling the expansion are limited by very modest values , which might be typical for interstellar conditions .",
    "+ the combination of these gas dynamic effects with the emission characteristics for the release of freshly produced radioactive isotopes such as @xmath0 and @xmath11 allows to predict the spatial intensity distribution of the expected @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "this is of special importance in the physical understanding why the observed 1.809 mev intensity distribution correlates so well with strongly blurred tracers . beside the uncertainties due to the evaporation process and therefore the efficiency of radiative cooling in the early stages ,",
    "the results of the population synthesis are strongly affected by the uncertainties in the stellar wind models .",
    "the geneva stellar evolution which have been used for consistency reasons apply an enhancement factor of 2 to the mass loss rates during the main - sequence and wr - phase .",
    "therefore the expected wind power is roughly a factor of 2 higher than for typical observed stars . in contrast , an underestimation of the wind velocities of only 30% will already restore the wind power in our model .",
    "we therefore estimate our results to be reliable within a factor of 2 or so .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the observed 1.809 mev intensity pattern correlates very nicely with the galactic free - free emission observed with cobe dmr at 53 ghz @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this close correlation points to massive , hot stars being the dominant sources of interstellar @xmath0 .",
    "the free - free emission originates from the ionised portions of the interstellar medium which is found in compact hii regions as well as in from of the diffuse ionised medium .",
    "it is strongly believed that in both cases the ionising extreme ultra - violet radiation from young , massive stars is the dominant source of keeping the medium ionised @xcite . in the framework of our population synthesis model we therefore incorporated the emission of lyman continuum photons by means of a simple fit - function in dependence of the initial mass of the emitting star .",
    "@xmath19\\cdot10^{49}\\,{\\rm s^{-1}}\\ ] ] this function is fitted to the lyman continuum photon fluxes from detailed stellar atmosphere calculations @xcite . for main - sequence stars",
    "the error is less then 5% by using this fit instead of the appropriate model values for the given initial mass .",
    "nevertheless , the error of the resulting time - profile of the lyman continuum emission of an ob association is considerably larger due to disregarding the effects of stellar evolution .",
    "however , a comparison with an alternative euv emission model based on direct interpolation of the appropriate fluxes from stellar atmosphere models reveals an overestimation of the cumulative lyc flux in our association model of less than 30% which is of the order as theoretical uncertainties of the underlying stellar models .",
    "[ fig3 ]     + figure [ fig3 ] shows the time - evolution of the integral lyc flux versus the decay rate of interstellar @xmath0 and @xmath11 , respectively , for the same association model discussed earlier .",
    "the plotted trajectories start with low decay rates at high euv luminosities and evolve to considerable decay rates at vanishing lyc fluxes . in principle , this behaviour could be exploit to construct a very sensitive age indicator for the underlying population",
    ". the ratio of the observed 1.809 mev flux from an astronomical source population and the respective lyc flux , which in principle could be extracted from the observed free - free intensity by using a proper ionisation model , should be independent of the distance to the population .",
    "after an additional normalisation of this ratio relative to the lyc flux of an o7v star one gets the o7v equivalent yield for an radioactive isotope for a given population @xcite . indeed , this quantity can be used as sensitive age indicator as shown in figure [ fig4 ] for the case of @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig4 ]     + especially in the regime between 3 and 10 myr the o7v equivalent yield shows a strong increase over 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is due to the strong decrease of the number of o stars because of supernovae and the two emission peaks in the time profile of the interstellar @xmath0 content ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "+ additionally , the released lyc flux can be used as input to an ionisation model to calculate a prediction map of expected free - free intensity of an area under investigation .",
    "this could in turn be compared to the observed one and therefore may give an additional constrain on the real population .",
    "as already discussed in section 2.1 the application of our population synthesis model , which assumes a continuos mass function , to a real astronomical population is expected to be significantly disturbed by population statistics . whereas for galaxies the mass function is sampled sufficiently dense to justify a quasi - analytic treatment this might not be the case for ob associations or even worth open clusters .",
    "we therefore studied the statistical errors as function of the richness by means of monte carlo version of the model .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the spread of the resulting interstellar @xmath0 masses at time of the emission maximum in dependence of the richness .",
    "[ fig5 ]     + for populations richer than 100 stars initially more massive than @xmath13 the statistical error drops below the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in addition , the monte carlo code allows the determination of probability density functions for direct application of the association model to observed populations by means of a bayesian analysis .",
    "the cygnus region is the most significant isolated structure in the comptel 1.8 mev maps beyond the inner galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the cygnus ob associations superimposed as circles on the latest comptel maximum entropy image of the cygnus region @xcite .",
    "+     + as a first test we applied our model to the given ob associations encircled in figure [ fig6 ] and generated an 1.809 mev intensity model , which for simplicity neglects the gas dynamic effects discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "the population synthesis is based on a database built from recent literature on population studies of the cygnus region .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the resulting intensity model . at first glance",
    "this model already reproduces the observed emission peak and the extension to higher longitudes .",
    "but , significant discrepancies are still remaining .",
    "first , the overall flux is underestimated by the model . after a variation of the slope of the initial mass spectrum turned out to be insignificant in resolving this problem ,",
    "the most plausible explanation is an underestimation of populations due to strong visual extinction towards cygnus .",
    "second , the modelled intensity distribution is significantly narrower than the observed pattern , which could be understood if one reminds the neglect of gas dynamic effects due to bubble formation .",
    "we have presented an extension of population synthesis studies to the domain of @xmath1-ray line astronomy .",
    "the discussed theoretical uncertainties are far from being insignificant .",
    "in addition , it is questionable if the observation and modelling of ob associations as laboratories for testing specific aspects of the theoretical understanding of the chemical evolution leading to interstellar enrichment of radioactive isotopes are sufficient due to possible tremendous statistical uncertainties . for stellar populations of massive stars being richer than 100 objects",
    "our model shows that theoretical uncertainties begin to dominate .",
    "so , one can conclude that indeed areas with rich associations may be used for testing theoretical aspects .",
    "at least , the observations can be used to check the consistency by extracting constrains from combined analyses at different wavelengths .",
    "+ it was shown explicitly that the combined analysis of free - free emission and the observed 1.809 mev intensity may serve as a sensitive age indicator for young stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , the rather simplistic application of the model to the 1.809 mev emission in the cygnus region already showed the potential in extracting constrains from the @xmath1-ray line observations .",
    "however , due to the neglect of additional possible source candidates such as peculiar massive close binary systems these constrains are not very stringent up to now ."
