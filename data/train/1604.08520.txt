    "multiferroic materials , in which spontaneous ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order coexist , have been investigated intensively due to their multifunctionality @xcite and potentials for applications in the next - generation multifunctional devices .",
    "the co - existence of ferro-orders in multiferroics allows the possibility that the magnetization can be tuned by an applied electric field and vice versa . among compounds that are multiferroics ,",
    "bifeo@xmath4 ( bfo ) is a paradigmatic and currently the most studied material .",
    "the multiferroic bfo exhibits the co - existence of ferroelectric ordering with curie temperature ( t@xmath5 ) of 1103 k and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering with a nel temperature ( t@xmath6 of 643 k @xcite . however , preparation of pure bifeo@xmath4 is a challenge due to the formation of different impurity phases @xcite .",
    "the ferroelectricity in bifeo@xmath4 is considered to originate primarily from displacements of the bi@xmath7 ions due to the lone 6s@xmath8 pair .",
    "the magnetic ordering of bifeo@xmath4 is g - type antiferromagnetic , having a spiral modulated spin structure ( smss ) with an incommensurate long - wavelength period of 62 nm @xcite .",
    "this spiral spin structure cancels the macroscopic magnetization and prevents the observation of the linear magnetoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "these problems ultimately limit the use of bulk bifeo@xmath4 in functional applications .",
    "many current investigations seek to suppress the spiral spin structure in an effort to release the inherent magnetization of this canted antiferromagnet and consequently to improve its multiferroic properties .",
    "one of the easiest ways to destroy the smss in bfo is the structural modifications or deformations introduced by cation substitutions or doping .",
    "therefore , to perturb the smss and to improve the multiferroic properties of bifeo@xmath4 , investigations were carried out substituting bi by rare - earth ions @xcite or alkaline - earth ions @xcite and also substituting fe by transition metal ions @xcite .",
    "recent investigations also demonstrated that co - doping at bi- and fe - sites of bifeo@xmath4 by ions such as la and mn @xcite , la and ti @xcite , nd and sc @xcite , gd and ti @xcite , ba and mn @xcite etc .",
    ", respectively can significantly improve multiferroic properties of bifeo@xmath4 for various applications . in this investigation",
    ", we have preferred this co - doping approach and have performed simultaneous minor substitution of bi and fe in bifeo@xmath4 by ions such as ba and ti , respectively to observe their multiferroic properties .",
    "the partial substitution of bi@xmath7 with ions having the biggest ionic radius can suppress effectively the spiral spin structure of bifeo@xmath4 @xcite , therefore , we have chosen ba ( ionic radii 1.42  ) in place of bi ( ionic radii 1.17  ) as a doping element .",
    "moreover , it is already proved that substitution of ba in place of bi in bifeo@xmath4 can improve their multiferroic properties @xcite .",
    "the substitution of ti in stead of fe in bifeo@xmath4 is especially attractive due to the fact that it is able to decrease the leakage current in bifeo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we think that co - doping of ba and ti in bifeo@xmath4 could be an effective route to improve magnetic as well as ferroelectric properties of bifeo@xmath4 .    the spiral spin structure of bfo is also known to be destroyed by the action of finite size effects in nanophase bifeo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is evident that nanoparticles of bifeo@xmath4 , especially those with a particle size of the order of or smaller than the 62 nm smss , exhibit improved multiferroic properties @xcite .",
    "synthesis of bifeo@xmath4 multiferroic nanoparticles hence requires a particle size of the order of or smaller than 62 nm .",
    "the most widely used synthesis techniques for bifeo@xmath4 nanoparticles are based on different chemical routes @xcite which involve toxic precursors and complex solution processes @xcite .",
