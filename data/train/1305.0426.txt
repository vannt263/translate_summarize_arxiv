    "in the last two decades , laser technologies have made a giant leap forward such that laser sources of ultrarelativistic intensity level can be attained @xcite .",

    "the latter is one of the fundamental  processes at the interaction of superstrong laser pulses with plasma and under the some circumstances inverse - bremsstrahlung absorption may become dominant mechanism of absorption of strong electromagnetic ( em ) radiation in underdense plasma .    with the advent of lasers",
    "many pioneering papers have been devoted to the theoretical investigation of the electron - ion scattering processes in gas or plasma in the presence of a laser field using nonrelativistic csb1,qsb1,csb2,bornnr1,lf1,csb3,bunk , eik1,lf2,qsb2 as well as relativistic @xcite considerations .",
