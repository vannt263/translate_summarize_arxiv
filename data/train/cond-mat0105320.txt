    "spin models are said to be frustrated when they contain competing interactions which prevent the simultaneous minimisation of all the lattice bonds in the ground state@xcite .",
    "the system is additionally described as fully frustrated if each plaquette of the lattice is itself frustrated@xcite .",
    "the nature of a phase transition depends partly on the symmetry group of the candidate low - temperature phases .",
    "frustration effects are then of most interest when they lead to infinitely degenerate or `` nearly - degenerate '' ground states .",
    "these will in general satisfy a larger symmetry group than the individual spins , possibly giving rise to exotic critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "one such phenomenon is re - entrance@xcite .",
    "this occurs when a disordered paramagnetic phase comes to lie at a lower temperature than an ordered phase ; as the temperature is increased there is a transition from disorder to order .",
    "one possible explanation for this phenomenon is the so - called `` order by disorder '' mechanism@xcite .    in this article",
    "we present results for two fully - frustrated three - state potts models : the potts piled - up - domino model ( from here on referred to simply as the piled - up - domino model ) and the potts zig - zag model ( or more concisely the zig - zag model ) . these are natural extensions of the ising - model equivalents studied previously by andr _",
    "et al._@xcite and are defined as follows :    the @xmath0-state potts model is defined as a set of variables @xmath1 associated with the sites @xmath2 of a lattice@xcite .",
    "each @xmath3 takes one of @xmath0 distinct values .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by : @xmath4 where the sum runs over all pairs of sites and @xmath5 are the interaction strengths between a given pair of spins .",
    "for the models of interest in this article , the interaction strengths are given by @xmath6 as shown in figures  [ lattice ]  ( a ) and  ( b ) for the piled - up - domino and zig - zag models respectively .",
    "for convenience we define @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 will be taken as positive throughout . in this article",
    "we shall concentrate on the @xmath9 potts models .    in the ising versions of these models ,",
    "the frustration effects suppress the critical temperature , which becomes zero when @xmath10@xcite .",
    "we show that , while this remains the case for the three - state potts zig - zag model , the three - state potts piled - up - domino model has a finite critical temperature when @xmath10 and displays reentrant behaviour .",
    "the article is divided as follows : in the next section we present briefly the transfer matrix method used in our study , and in we apply this method to the calculation of the residual ground - state entropy for the piled - up - domino model . we show that the residual ground - state entropy for the zig - zag model is exactly related to the equivalent ising - model case . in we present the finite - temperature phase diagrams for the two cases and will be devoted to discussion .",
    "the results presented in this article are obtained using a ( numerical ) transfer matrix calculation , giving the partition function for strips of finite width @xmath11 but infinite length , @xmath12 .",
    "the results are therefore numerically exact for a given lattice width @xmath11 .",
    "the partition function for the model may be written in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the contribution to the boltzmann weight of a given column spin - state @xmath15 due to interactions within a column and @xmath16 is the contribution due to interactions between adjacent columns , and depends on the spin states of the two columns @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "if additionally periodic boundary conditions are taken in the @xmath18-direction , the partition function for the system may be written as a trace over a product of transfer matrices : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and the sum over spin states is taken care of by the matrix multiplications . denoting the eigenvalues of @xmath21 by @xmath22 , @xmath23    as",
    "@xmath24 becomes large the partition function is dominated by the largest eigenvalue .",
    "the ( dimensionless ) free energy per spin , @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 and the correlation length is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the largest eigenvalue and @xmath29 is the second largest eigenvalue ( in absolute value)@xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath30 is indexed by @xmath15 and @xmath31 both of which correspond to one of @xmath32 distinct column spin states .",
    "the capacity required to store the @xmath33 matrix elements on a computer soon becomes prohibitive . in order to extend the range of values of @xmath11 which may be treated numerically ,",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath30 is decomposed into a product of sparse matrices as follows :    one may view the transfer matrix as an operator which adds an additional column to the lattice .",
    "each element of the matrix is indexed by the spin configuration on the last column of the lattice ( @xmath11 spins ) and the spin configuration of the column being added .",
    "if we define a dangling bond as the bond which has only one spin attached to it , we see that the transfer matrix replaces the @xmath11 existing dangling bonds with @xmath11 new ones .",
    "the entry configurations and exit configurations are given by the values of the spins attached to these dangling bonds .",
    "if now , instead of adding a whole column at once , one spin is added at a time , there are still @xmath11 dangling bonds beforehand and afterwards ( see )",
    ". this operation may be written as a matrix indexed by the configuration of the @xmath11 spins connected to a dangling bond before the addition of the new spin , and the configuration of the @xmath11 spins connected to a dangling bond after the spin addition .",
    "since @xmath34 spins are common to the input and output configurations , the matrix elements will be non - zero only if these spins have the same values in the input and output configurations .",
    "the corresponding matrix is thus sparse . in this way",
    "@xmath30 may be decomposed : @xmath35 where the matrices @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 correspond to one - spin additions .",
    "if the boundary conditions and in - column interactions are taken care of when the first and last spins are added , then the intermediary spin additions may all be performed by the same matrix .",
    "the combination of the @xmath39 being sparse and the small number of distinct matrices required to build up @xmath30 vastly reduces the storage requirements and enables calculation for lattice widths up to @xmath40 .",
    "an alternative method for writing the transfer matrix involves the kasteleyn - fortuin mapping  @xcite to map the potts model to a lattice animal problem  @xcite .",
    "this mapping requires periodic boundary conditions to enable a sparse - matrix reduction  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 the transfer matrices in the two representations require an equivalent amount of storage but in a spin representation it is easier to implement the different boundary conditions used in this article .",
    "the eigenvalues used were calculated using the lanczos method , using the arpack package .",
    "in this section we calculate the ground - state entropy for the two models . in both models , when @xmath41 the model is ferromagnetic . while they are anisotropic , there is no competition in the interactions .",
    "the system minimises its energy by choosing the same state for all the spins giving @xmath0 distinct ground states@xcite .",
    "the entropy per spin is zero .",
    "a lattice bond is `` satisfied '' when the interaction energy along it is minimal , and `` frustrated '' otherwise .",
    "it may be seen that for @xmath42 it is no longer possible to simultaneously satisfy all four bonds of a plaquette . the model is then said to be frustrated . however , if @xmath43 there is no ambiguity , in the ground state , over which bond to frustrate .",
    "the frustration does not change the ground state configuration , and the entropy per spin remains zero .",
    "for @xmath10 the energy of a plaquette is minimal regardless of which bond is frustrated as long as one and only one bond is frustrated .",
    "there are an infinite number of frustrated bond configurations satisfying the ground state condition and the entropy per spin in this case is finite .",
    "for @xmath44 the ground state degeneracy is still infinite .",
    "while it is clear that the system will satisfy the antiferromagnetic bond in order to minimise the energy , there is still a choice over which of three ferromagnetic bonds to frustrate .",
    "the entropy per spin here is also finite .",
    "the ground - state entropy for the piled - up - domino model was calculated using transfer matrices . in the ground state",
    "it is necessary to add two spins at a time in order to ensure that only one bond per plaquette is frustrated .",
    "since the energy is constant and minimal , the entropy per spin is simply the number of ground states per spin , leading to : @xmath45 the entropy was calculated with transfer direction parallel to the dashed lines as shown in .",
    "both free and periodic boundary conditions were considered .",
    "the results are shown in .",
    "it may be seen that the entropy per spin is substantially larger than for the ising - piled - up - domino model .",
    "the extrapolations to @xmath46 throughout the article are done using the bulirch and stoer algorithm@xcite .",
    "the ground - state entropy per spin for the zig - zag model is the same in the potts and ising cases .",
    "this can be illustrated as follows",
    ": imagine that , from some suitable boundary configuration of spins , a ground - state configuration of spins is built up by adding alternately plaquettes of type * a * and * b * , shown in , in rows , starting from top left and ending bottom right , one plaquette at a time . the spins marked by a cross are shared with plaquettes already added to the lattice , and are thus already fixed . in the ground state only one bond per plaquette is frustrated .",
    "whichever of the bonds is frustrated in a plaquette of type * a * , the `` free '' spin is connected by a ferromagnetic path to a predetermined spin . at first sight",
    "this is not true for plaquettes of type * b * , however the frustrated bond is shared between two plaquettes , and it can be seen that the `` free '' spin is connected by a ferromagnetic path to a predetermined spin either directly , or via the neighbouring plaquette ( of type * a * ) see .",
    "the entropy per spin in the ground state is thus determined uniquely by the configurational entropy of the frustrated bonds , with no additional ( local ) degeneracy due to the number of potts states .",
    "this was not so in the piled - up - domino case where it is possible to create free domains of spins .",
    "the residual ground - state entropy per spin is thus the same as reported for the ising model@xcite , i.e. :    @xmath47\\\\ & = & 0.1615\\cdots\\ { \\rm for\\ } \\alpha<-1\\\\ s&=&\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2}\\int_0^{\\pi}{\\rm d}\\theta\\int_0^{\\pi}{\\rm d}\\phi \\log\\left[4(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\phi)\\right]\\\\ & = & \\frac{g}{\\pi}=0.2916\\cdots\\ \\ { \\rm for\\ } \\alpha=-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the difference between the ground - states of the ising and potts versions of the zig - zag models is an overall degeneracy relating to the symmetry of the spin ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "this was not the case for the piled - up - domino model , where the entropy per spin for the potts case was significantly larger than the for ising case for both @xmath10 and @xmath44 .",
    "this difference indicates that the difference in symmetry group for the ground - states in the two cases is not simply due to the difference in the symmetry groups of the spins .",
    "based on these results , it is reasonable to expect that the phase diagram of the potts zig - zag model should be qualitatively similar to the ising case , but that the finite - temperature behaviour of the piled - up - domino model may well be qualitatively different .",
    "this is indeed what will be observed in the next section .",
    "in this section we present the phase diagrams for the piled - up - domino and zig - zag models .",
    "the critical lines may be identified using phenomenological renormalisation@xcite . at a critical point",
    "the correlation lengths for two strip widths , measured as a fraction of the strip width , must be the same .",
    "this reflects the scale invariance of a critical system . in practice",
    "a finite width system is always off - critical , however @xmath50 gives a finite - size estimate of the critical temperature , @xmath51 , which will tend to the true critical temperature as the strip widths tend to infinity . assuming that the system is sufficiently close to the true critical point , the correlation length behaves ( to leading order ) as @xmath52 since it is the finite width of the system which prevents the correlation length from diverging , at @xmath51 we have @xmath53 .",
    "if these two scaling laws are admitted , then a finite - size estimate of the correlation length exponent may be calculated from the equation : @xmath54      the phase diagram found using phenomenological renormalisation for the zig - zag model with periodic boundary conditions is shown in .",
    "the finite - size effects are very small .",
    "the critical temperature is known exactly for two points on the phase diagram@xcite : @xmath55 , corresponding to the pure ferromagnetic potts model on the square lattice , and @xmath56 , corresponding to the ferromagnetic potts model on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "our numerical values calculated at these two points are extrapolated and compared with the exact values in .",
    "qualitatively the phase diagram is the same as for the ising model : there is a phase transition between a low temperature ferro - magnetic phase and a high temperature phase for @xmath43 .",
    "the critical temperature becomes zero at @xmath10 and there is no evidence of a phase transition for @xmath44 .    the finite size estimates for the exponent @xmath57 are shown in . for a pure three - state potts model ( @xmath55 corresponding to the square lattice , and @xmath56 corresponding to the hexagonal lattice ) , the value of @xmath58 is known exactly@xcite . for @xmath59 the estimates for @xmath57 converge to the exact value .",
    "close to @xmath10 the estimates for @xmath57 seem to take on a different value , but the range of values of @xmath60 over which this variation is observed diminishes as the system size increases .",
    "there is no evidence of a multicritical point in the phase diagram between @xmath55 and @xmath10 , and so it would seem reasonable to assume that the whole line up to @xmath10 remains in the same universality class as the ferromagnetic three - state potts model .",
    "the phase diagrams for the piled - up - domino model with periodic and free boundary conditions found using phenomenological renormalisation are shown in .",
    "the critical temperature is known exactly for @xmath55 @xcite , the pure three - state potts model on the square lattice , and at this point the critical temperature coincides trivially with that found in the zig - zag model .",
    "it may also be easily determined for @xmath56 . when @xmath56 the spins on the dashed lines ( see  ( a ) ) may be traced over .",
    "the resulting model is a ferromagnetic potts model on a square lattice with different interactions in the @xmath18 and @xmath61 directions : @xmath62 and @xmath63 the critical temperature is known to satisfy@xcite : @xmath64 which leads to @xmath65 , measured in units of @xmath66 . in",
    "we compare the finite - size critical - temperature estimates , extrapolated using the bulirch and stoer algorithm@xcite , with the exact value calculated at @xmath56 .",
    "the agreement is good .    before trying to interpret the phase diagrams shown in",
    "we review the main features of the ising piled - up - domino model , reported in  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram , shown in , is made up of two transition lines in the ising model universality class .",
    "the transition line for @xmath43 corresponds to the standard ising transition between a ferromagnetic low - temperature phase and a paramagnetic high - temperature phase .",
    "for @xmath44 the ground state is highly degenerate . the low temperature phase is characterized as follows : the spins on the antiferromagnetic lines order ferromagnetically in the @xmath61 direction and antiferromagnetically in the @xmath18 direction , where @xmath18 and @xmath61 directions are taken as in .",
    "the spins on the horizontal ferromagnetic lines are partially disordered .",
    "the transition is between this partially ordered antiferromagnetic phase and the high - temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "the two transition lines meet with infinite slope at @xmath10 , where the critical temperature is zero .",
    "these results contrast with the phase diagrams shown in for the three - state potts models .",
    "the phase diagrams shown are calculated using finite width strips of width @xmath11 in the direction perpendicular to the antiferromagnetic lines and infinite in the parallel direction . in  ( a )",
    "periodic boundary conditions are taken and in  ( b ) free boundary conditions are taken .",
    "periodic boundary conditions reduce the number of possible configurations available to the system , compared to the free boundary case , making it harder to excite the system , and tending to lock in the low temperature phase .",
    "this is observed in the phase diagrams where in the periodic boundary case the critical temperature estimates converge to the thermodynamic limit from above , whilst for the open boundary case the critical temperature estimates converge from below ( see also ) .",
    "in we compare the critical - temperature estimates for the two boundary conditions for various key values of @xmath60 and we find good agreement between the boundary conditions .",
    "the two estimated phase diagrams are , however , quite different at first sight , notably for @xmath60 less than about @xmath67 . before trying to reconcile the differences ,",
    "let us summarise the similarities .",
    "for @xmath10 there exists a finite - temperature phase transition with @xmath68 . in",
    "we show finite - size estimates for the exponent @xmath57 calculated using the two different boundary conditions .",
    "the extrapolated value of @xmath57 for the open boundary conditions at @xmath10 indicates a transition in the three - state potts universality class .",
    "the finite - size estimates for @xmath10 with periodic boundary conditions are still too far from the thermodynamic limit to permit good extrapolation .",
    "the point @xmath10 with @xmath69 corresponds to a special point on the phase diagram , since it is the point which separates the ferromagnetic ground state ( @xmath70 ) from the frustrated highly degenerate ground state ( @xmath71 finite ) .",
    "it therefore corresponds to a transition point , which one would expect to be connected to the rest of the phase diagram .",
    "the phase diagram with open boundary conditions clearly shows a reentrant phase ending in a multiphase point which we identify with the special point @xmath72 . whilst the periodic boundary results do show the begining of a reentrant phase , the results are less clear",
    "however , as we have seen , there is good agreement between the extrapolated critical temperatures right up to @xmath10 .",
    "the transition lines become progressively more rounded as the system width increases .",
    "the failure of the transition lines to reach @xmath69 for the finite widths is probably related to a stabilisation of the low - temperature phase by the periodicity condition . to verify this conjecture",
    ", we compare the exact phase diagram found by andr @xcite with both periodic boundary condition and open boundary condition calculations , see .",
    "the convergence is excelent in both cases but , as for the potts model , the periodic boundary condition results fail reach @xmath69 ( the transition lines for widths 12 and 14 reach @xmath73 ) , whereas the open boundary condition transition lines do extend right down to @xmath69 . in the light of these considerations it seems to us",
    "likely that the point @xmath72 remains a multiphase point in the potts model , where the paramagnetic , ferromagnetic and partially ordered phases meet .",
    "this view is conforted by the observation that the residual entropy per site at zero temperature is higher for @xmath10 than for either @xmath44 or @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the ground state is more disordered at @xmath10 than for @xmath44 presumably due the the coexistence of the paramagnetic and partially disordered phases .    in models with competing interactions ,",
    "as is the case here , one may define disorder lines which indicate where the nature of the correlation function changes from monotonic ( due to the ferromagnetic interactions ) to oscillatory ( due to the antiferromagnetic interactions)@xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that the correlation function ( in the transfer direction ) is related to the first and second largest eigenvalues in absolute value ( the largest being always positive ) through : @xmath74 if @xmath29 is positive , then @xmath75 is monotonically decreasing , but if @xmath29 is negative then @xmath76 and is oscillatorily - decreasing .",
    "if we define @xmath77 as the largest positive eigenvalue , and @xmath78 as the largest ( in absolute value ) negative eigenvalue , then the disorder line is found when @xmath79 .",
    "the disorder lines for various lattice widths are shown in as lines .",
    "it is common to find disorder lines associated with reentrant phases . in this case",
    "the disorder lines must enter the cusp caused by the reentrant paramagnetic phase ; since the disorder line corresponds to a change in behaviour of the correlation function it may not cross a critical line .",
    "the disorder lines for the two different boundary conditions may be seen to converge to a common line as the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "the limiting disorder line is curved , contrary to the ising case , see [ diso ] , were the disorder line is calculated analytically and found to be a vertical line at @xmath10 .",
    "the two transition lines join in the form of a cusp , with the disorder line between them ( as in the ising case ) .",
    "the form of the disorder line may then be seen as confirming the existence of the reentrant paramagnetic phase .",
    "phenomenological renormalisation indicates two possible phase diagrams depending on which boundary conditions were taken : either the transition line extends to @xmath80 and the phase diagram resembles qualitatively a distorted version of the ising model phase diagram , or there is a second reentrance .",
    "the true thermodynamic phase diagram may correspond to one of the two posibilities discussed , or to a combination of the two , or indeed to neither .    in order to shed some light on this issue",
    "it is interesting to look at a variety of average thermodynamic quantities , such as the magnetisation , energy , average numbers of each type of bond that are satisfied , etc .",
    "it is possible to calculate with relative ease such local average quantities in the framework of a transfer matrix calculation .    in order to calculate the magnetisation it is necessary to first calculate the probability of having configuration @xmath15 in column @xmath18 .",
    "this probability is simply the ratio of the partition function restricted to having configuration @xmath15 and the unrestricted partition function , which in terms of transfer matrices may be written : @xmath81 writing @xmath82 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath83 and taking @xmath24 to infinity and using the fact the @xmath83 is a real symmetric matrix leads to : @xmath84 the magnetisation for the potts model is defined as : @xmath85 with @xmath86 the maximum of @xmath87 , where @xmath88 are the densities of spins in each of the potts states .",
    "defining @xmath89 as the magnetisation for a column state as @xmath90 with @xmath91 the largest of the numbers of each spin type present in configuration @xmath92 .",
    "the magnetisation is then given as @xmath93    since @xmath94 is the probability of finding a column in configuration @xmath92 , then the probability of finding a column with magnetisation @xmath95 is given by @xmath96    it is important to note that this is _ not _ the probability of a magnetisation @xmath95 for the system as a whole . since this probability distribution is restricted to a column it gives a finer probe into the probable column configurations .",
    "this is plotted for @xmath97 and @xmath98 as a probability density function in figure  [ prob ] by dividing each probability by the interval between allowed values of the magnetisation for a given lattice width .",
    "it may be clearly seen that the probability density is developing two peaks , one at @xmath99 and a second at a substantially lower value of @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that in the low temperature phase each column has a high probability of being ordered ferromagnetically ( along the @xmath61 direction)or of being ( partially ) disordered .",
    "how these are arranged in the @xmath18 direction is not easy to calculate in the transfer matrix formalism , but preliminary monte carlo calculations@xcite seem to indicate that the system alternates in the @xmath18 direction between ferromagnetically ordered and disordered columns .",
    "the probability distribution shown is virtually identical for the two considered boundary conditions and for @xmath97 and @xmath100 .",
    "the peak at @xmath99 is lost in the high temperature phase , clearly indicating the absence of magnetic order .",
    "no evidence of two different frustrated phases could be found from the distribution of the magnetisation probability .    to calculate quantities such as the energy per spin or the densities of satisfied bonds it is necessary to calculate the probabilities of having a configuration @xmath15 in column @xmath18 and @xmath17 in column @xmath101 since",
    "these quantities are defined in terms of pairs of spins , which may belong to two adjacent columns .",
    "the calculation of the joint probability @xmath102 follows exactly as above : @xmath103 defining @xmath104 and @xmath105 as the densities of satisfied bonds , we may calculate the average values : @xmath106 and similarly for @xmath107 .",
    "these two quantities are plotted in for ( a ) @xmath97 and ( b ) @xmath100 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it may be seen that there is a clear difference of behaviour between @xmath97 and @xmath100 . in the first case",
    "the two densities may be seen to drop away from their maximal values at the different temperatures ( shown approximately by arrows in ( a ) ) . in the second case",
    "this same drop off occurs at the same temperature for the two different densities .",
    "the results for the densities show a high degree of agreement between the two different boundary conditions . both show a qualitative difference of behaviour between @xmath97 and @xmath100 , and evidence of possible phase transitions for both values of @xmath60 , indicated by arrows in figure  [ dens ] , two for @xmath97 and one for @xmath100 .",
    "the specific heat does not diverge with system size for either of these values of @xmath60 , but the peaks of the specific heat converge to a temperature consistent with the critical temperature shown in ( a ) for @xmath60 less than about @xmath108 and all @xmath109 .",
    "we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to conjecture a phase diagram as shown semi - schematically in , with a possible second partially ordered phase at low temperature , ( po ii ) .",
    "this additional phase , compared to the piled - up - domino ising model , is only presented speculatively ; the width of this phase reduces as system size increases ( see ) and may disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if such a phase were to exist then it is likely to terminate at a multicritical point ( a ) .",
    "the presence of such a multicritical point could provide evidence of such a phase .",
    "the main results presented in this article relate to the potts piled - up - domino model , where we have presented behaviour which is remarkably different from the equivalent ising case , notably a finite - temperature transition and reentrant behaviour .",
    "it is unusual to see reentrance in such a simple model .",
    "models showing reentrance normally contain competing nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour interactions@xcite or interaction between different spin types  @xcite .",
    "the additional entropy available due to the greater number of spin states stabilises the ferromagnetic ground - state as the temperature is increased ( with @xmath10 ) , contrary to the nave anticipation that the extra degrees of freedom will disorder the system more .",
    "this may be understood as follows : in the ising case the ground states may be mapped one to one onto dimer coverings of the lattice , but when the @xmath0-state potts model is considered the mapping is no longer one to one , and the additional degeneracy is not uniformly distributed .",
    "this reweighting must apply to all the low lying states , and must serve to stabilise the ferromagnetic phase as the temperature is increased through an order by disorder mechanism . in the zig - zag case",
    "the different dimer coverings have the same weight in the ground state , as in the ising case , and we do not observe an equivalent stabilisation of the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "the exact nature of the phase diagram and the low temperature phases for @xmath44 remain to be fully determined , and will doubtless require other methods .",
    "this will be the object of a future study .",
    "we would like to thank h.t .",
    "diep , c. pinettes and t.t .",
    "truong for interesting and useful discussions .",
    "the free energy and phase diagram for the ising piled - up - domino model was solved exactly by andr @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge the disorder line has not been found for this model .",
    "andr give the ( dimensionless ) free energy per spin as : @xmath110 with @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we deduce the form of the generic correlation function as @xmath112 leading to @xmath113    the modulation of @xmath114 in the @xmath18 ( @xmath61 ) direction is governed by the maximum of @xmath115 , or the minimum of @xmath116 , with respect to qx ( qy ) .",
    "since the modulation is anticipated in the @xmath18-direction ( see@xcite ) , we seek the turning points of @xmath116 with respect to @xmath117 : @xmath118 which becomes zero when @xmath119 or when @xmath120    checking the second derivative of @xmath121 it may be seen that the @xmath122 solution is a minimum as long as @xmath123 and the @xmath124 solution is a minimum as long as @xmath125 these two conditions correspond exactly to the boundaries within which the solution exists , which must correspond to a maximum .    in the range of values of @xmath60 for which the two solutions @xmath122 and @xmath124 are minima",
    "it remains to determine which corresponds to the absolute minimum .",
    "this may be determined by considering @xmath126 this changes sign when @xmath10 . for @xmath43",
    "the leading mode of the correlation function is the @xmath122 mode , while for @xmath44 the leading mode is the @xmath124 mode .",
