    "the phenomenon of pressure - induced softening  whereby the elastic stiffness of a material actually decreases on compression  is a counterintuitive mechanical response that is rarely observed in materials , at least over extended pressure ranges .",
    "the few known examples from experiment include silica glass ,  @xcite and two negative thermal expansion ( nte ) framework materials zrw@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite and zn(cn)@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite we have recently predicted the existence of pressure - induced softening in a number of cubic zeolites , all of which shown nte .",
    "@xcite    the intuition that materials should become stiffer under compression is grounded in the observation that shortening bonds increases the steepness of the corresponding potential energy surface .",
    "thus there is a strong fundamental physics interest in understanding the apparent violation of this basic mechanical response .",
    "it is also likely that the existence of this counterintuitive response in materials that display the equally rare phenomenon of volume nte is not coincidental .",
    "@xcite that pressure - induced softening may signal the existence of a host of unusual thermodynamic responses ( _ e.g. _  nte ) with important technological applications acts as further motivation to understand both its microscopic origin and its implications for other material properties .    in high - symmetry structures ,",
    "elastic stiffness can be characterized by the bulk modulus , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the volume , @xmath4 is the pressure , and @xmath5 is the temperature .",
    "@xcite typical values of @xmath6 lie in the range 30100gpa , with larger values corresponding to materials of increasing mechanical stiffness .",
    "@xcite experimentally , @xmath7 is usually measured by fitting the pressure dependence of the crystallographically - determined unit cell volume to an appropriate equation of state .",
    "@xcite the pressure dependence of the bulk modulus is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 , which for many materials has a value in the vicinity of @xmath9 at ambient temperature ; indeed this is the value to which the widely - used second - order birch - murnaghan equation of state corresponds .",
    "@xcite so , in other words , for most materials one expects an increase of 510% in bulk modulus for each 1gpa increase in hydrostatic pressure .    in this context ,",
    "measured _ negative _ values of @xmath10 ( @xmath11gpa )  @xcite for zrw@xmath0o@xmath1 , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13gpa )  @xcite or @xmath14 ( @xmath15gpa )  @xcite for zn(cn)@xmath0 are strikingly anomalous . in both cases",
    "an applied pressure of 1gpa causes the material stiffness to _ decrease _ by @xmath16% .",
    "discussion of the origin of pressure - induced softening have been given in references  , and , the first two corresponding in practice to a model that represents a two - dimensional idealization of zn(cn)@xmath0 ( see appendix  [ app_pantea ] ) .",
    "these works all associated the negative value of @xmath17 with dynamical effects associated with low - frequency phonon modes involving rotations of quasi - rigid polyhedral groups of atoms .",
    "what has not yet been seen at all is the dependence of pressure - induced softening on temperature in any material . in this paper",
    "we study this effect in zn(cn)@xmath0 using both molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and variable-@xmath18 neutron powder diffraction .",
    "our md simulations reveal a very strong temperature dependence to @xmath17 , which even involves a change in sign .",
    "based on an interpretation of the relevant fluctuations , we propose an empirical form for the @xmath19 function .",
    "a simple single - particle hamiltonian of a rigid - unit mode system similar to zn(cn)@xmath0 was analyzed in ref .  , but this gives a prediction for the temperature dependence of pressure - induced softening that differs from the results presented in this paper ; we discuss this in appendix  [ app_pantea ] .",
    "this paper begins with a brief discussion of the lattice dynamics of zn(cn)@xmath0 , from which we predict qualitatively the form of the @xmath19 function .",
    "we proceed to describe first the md simulations we have performed , which establish the temperature - dependence of @xmath17 for this material , and second the neutron diffraction experiments that provide some confirmation of the md results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our study for computational and experimental investigations of pressure - induced softening in related systems .",
    "from a lattice dynamics perspective , the key point of interest concerning zinc cyanide has always been its nte behaviour :  @xcite the volume of its cubic unit cell decreases on heating at a rate that is more than double that of longer - established nte systems such as zrw@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the crystal structure of zn(cn)@xmath0  @xcite can be described as a network of zinc atoms connected via linear zn ",
    "n  zn linkages as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "each zn centre is coordinated in a tetrahedral fashion by four c or n atoms .",
    "@xcite it is thought that , to a first approximation , these tetrahedral units are not readily deformed ,  @xcite so the dominant vibrational motion in zinc cyanide involves flexing of the zn  c  n  zn linkages as propagated in a family of low - energy transverse acoustic phonon modes with energies less than 1thz .",
    "@xcite     crystal structure of zn(cn)@xmath0 showing the two sublattices where one is shown using photorealistic shading to represent the atoms and the other with the atoms represented by open spheres .",
    "the primary features are the tetrahedral coordination of the zn atoms ( larger spheres ) to the cn molecular anions ( smaller spheres connected by a short bond ) , and the linear zn  cyanide ",
    "zn connectivity.,width=8 ]    in the case of amorphous silica , molecular dynamics simulations suggested a relation between the bulk compressibility and the extent of network flexibility as measured by the magnitude of fluctuations involving whole - body rotations of sio@xmath20 tetrahedra .",
    "@xcite we can propose a similar explanation for the case of zn(cn)@xmath0 , where at some finite temperature the structure is buckled through rotations and translations of the zn(c / n)@xmath20 tetrahedra and cyanide bridges  the same fluctuations that are responsible for nte .",
    "an initial application of negative pressure to expand the structure will first be accommodated through straightening of the zn  c  n  zn linkages and alignment of the zn(c / n)@xmath20 tetrahedra , which costs relatively little energy .",
    "this process will then be followed later by stretching of the zn  c  n  zn linkages which costs rather more energy .",
    "thus the bulk modulus is expected to increase with negative pressure , which implies that @xmath21 takes a negative value .",
    "schematic curve showing the predicted variation of @xmath17 with temperature @xmath5 according to eq .  .",
    "this schematic defines the meanings of the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . ]",
    "this explanation suggests that the magnitude of the pressure - induced softening should depend on temperature . at low temperature",
    "there will be no fluctuations to accommodate stretching of the structure , and we therefore expect a positive value of @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , without fluctuations , compression of the structure will also require compression of bonds .",
    "thus we expect pressure - induced softening to occur only when there are thermal fluctuations , and we expect that on heating @xmath17 will initially have a positive value , which will reduce and become negative at some finite temperature . at higher temperatures we might expect not to see the transition between straightening the fluctuations and stretching of bonds , so that @xmath7 will become relatively constant with pressure and",
    "hence @xmath17 will tend towards zero from its negative value .",
    "we model the variation of @xmath17 with temperature @xmath5 in zn(cn)@xmath0 using the following phenomenological form : @xmath25 parameterised by the variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qualcurve ] . we will find below that the temperature - dependence of @xmath17 in zn(cn)@xmath0 obtained from both molecular dynamics simulations and neutron powder diffraction experiments is described well by this phenomenological model .",

    "each simulation was performed with an equilibration time of 20 ps followed by a run of 40 ps from which an average volume was calculated from writing the instantaneous volume at every 0.02 ps .",
