    "the spin - related phenomena in semiconductors have been attracting considerable attention since the discovery of the optical orientation of electron and nuclear spins and the basic mechanisms of spin relaxation  @xcite .",
    "much effort in this field is currently focused on the development of novel methods of spin orientation of free carriers ranging from the spin hall effect  @xcite and spin - dependent tunneling  @xcite to the optical orientation by linearly polarized light  @xcite . here",
    "we show that the spin orientation of free electrons can be achieved in semiconductor nanostructures by simple electron gas heating .",
    "we demonstrate that , in nanostructures of sufficiently low space symmetry , the electron - phonon interaction tending to restore equilibrium between the electrons and the crystal lattice is spin - dependent and leads to the spin orientation of carriers .",
    "such a thermal orientation of electron spins is considered here for asymmetric ( 110)-grown quantum wells ( qws ) where the electron gas heating leads to the spin orientation along the @xmath0 $ ] axis in the qw plane .    the possibility to achieve the spin polarization of carriers @xmath1 caused by the disturbance of thermal equilibrium in asymmetric ( 110)-grown qws follows from symmetry analysis . indeed",
    ", such structures belong to the point group @xmath2 that contains only two symmetry elements , namely , identity and a mirror plane perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis . here",
    "we use the following coordinate frame : @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] are the in - plane axes , and @xmath6 $ ] is the growth direction .",
    "reflection by the mirror plane changes the sign of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 components of the spin axial vector @xmath1 but does not modify the @xmath3 component .",
    "therefore , the spin component @xmath9 is an invariant in asymmetric ( 110)-grown qws suggesting that the spin polarization along the @xmath3 axis can emerge if the electron gas is driven out of equilibrium by any means .",
    "particularly , in the case of disturbance of thermal equilibrium between the electrons and the crystal lattice , the spin orientation can phenomenologically be described by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electron and lattice temperatures , respectively .",
    "the microscopic model of the thermal orientation of electron spins is caused by the energy relaxation of hot carriers and includes two stages which are illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "1(b ) .    in the first stage [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , the carriers lose a part of their kinetic energy by emitting phonons .",
    "such energy relaxation processes shown by curved arrows are spin - dependent  @xcite . in qw structures without an inversion center , spin - orbit interaction adds an asymmetric term to the probability of electron scattering by phonons which is linear in the wave vector components  @xcite .",
    "as is shown in the next section , the dominant spin - dependent contribution to the probability of electron scattering in ( 110)-grown qws is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the pauli matrix , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are components of the initial and scattered electron wave vectors .",
    "= 0.95    due to the spin - dependent asymmetry of the electron - phonon interaction , electrons with the spin `` up '' ( along the @xmath8 axis ) predominantly vacate the excited states with positive @xmath16 while electrons with the spin `` down '' vacate the excited states with negative @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to a nonequilibrium distribution where the spin - up hot carriers occupy mainly the left - hand branch of the dispersion curve ( carriers with the opposite spin orientation have gone to the subband bottom ) while the spin - down carriers occupy mainly the right - hand branch .    in the second stage [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , a net spin orientation of the electron gas appears as a result of the subsequent spin precession of nonequilibrium carriers in the effective magnetic field induced by the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "the field has nonzero in - plane components in asymmetrically growth qws , e.g. , due to the rashba effect  @xcite . therefore , the spins of nonequilibrium carriers , directed along or opposite to the @xmath8 axis after the phonon emission , will precess in the effective field as shown in fig .",
    "note that electrons with the initial spin @xmath18 and wave vector @xmath19 are acted upon by the effective field with the larmor frequency @xmath20 , while particles with the initial spin @xmath21 and the negative wave vector feel the field with the larmor frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the effective magnetic field induced by spin - orbit interaction is an odd function of the wave vector , therefore , @xmath23 , and the spins of particles with positive and negative values of @xmath16 rotate in opposite directions .",
    "this gives rise to the spin component @xmath24 for all hot electrons in the subband and the net spin polarization of the electron gas .",
    "we note that the electron spin caused by the energy relaxation processes is nonequilibrium and , therefore , can be rotated by an external static magnetic field , similarly to the hanle effect in optics .",
    "the spin - dependent asymmetry of the electron - phonon interaction can be obtained if one takes into account both @xmath25 admixture of the valence - band states to the conduction - band wave function and the phonon - induced interband coupling .",
    "to first order in the @xmath25 theory , where @xmath26 is the in - plane wave vector , the electron wave function in a ( 110)-grown qw has the form @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the bloch functions of the conduction and valence bands at the @xmath32 point of the brillouin zone , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the envelope spinors . the bloch functions @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in eq .",

    "we consider the electron scattering by acoustic phonons due to the deformation - potential mechanism . in cubic noncentrosymmetric crystals such as zinc - blende - type semiconductors ,",
    "the strain induces a coupling between the conduction - band and valence - band states  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of such a coupling have the form @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the interband constant of the deformation potential , and @xmath48 are the strain tensor components used here in the primed coordinate system .",
    "it is the strain - induced interband coupling together with the spin - orbit splitting of the valence band that leads to spin - dependent asymmetry of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "taking into account @xmath25 mixing given by eqs .",
    "( [ kp_func ] ) and ( [ v_kp ] ) and allowing for the interband coupling , we derive for the hamiltonian of the electron - phonon interaction in ( 110)-grown quantum wells @xmath49 @xmath50 + ( k_{y } + k'_{y } ) [ \\sigma_{x } u_{yz } + \\sigma_{z } u_{xy } ] \\right\\ } \\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the intraband constant of the deformation potential responsible for the dominant ( spin - independent ) part of the electron - phonon interaction , and @xmath52 is the coefficient given by @xmath53 in deriving eq .",
    "( [ v_elphon ] ) , we have expressed the strain tensor components in the primed axes via those in the qw coordinate system @xmath54 by using the equalities @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the probability of electron scattering is determined by squared matrix elements of the electron - phonon interaction  ( [ v_elphon ] ) . the dominant contribution to spin - dependent asymmetry of the electron scattering in quantum wells",
    "is given by terms proportional to the @xmath58 component of the phonon - induced strain tensor .",
    "this is because the strain tensor components depend on the wave vector and polarization of the phonon involved , and the in - plane component of the phonon wave vector @xmath59 is typically much smaller than the out - of - plane component @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the qw width .",
    "thus , the principle contribution to the scattering asymmetry in ( 110)-grown qw structures is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "this term is taken into account in calculations which follow .",
    "we note that @xmath63-linear terms in the matrix elements of the electron - phonon interaction can also be obtained in the second order in the @xmath25 theory , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the electron scattering by charge impurities . however , these terms lead to no essential contribution to asymmetry of the electron scattering by phonons nor the spin orientation caused by the energy relaxation processes .",
    "as is shown in section  [ sect2 ] , spin - dependent asymmetry of the scattering processes followed by the precession of electron spins in the effective magnetic field leads to spin orientation of the electron gas .",
    "we assume that the spin relaxation time of carriers is much longer than the thermalization time controlled by electron - electron collisions which is in turn much longer than the momentum relaxation time @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",

    "note that spin - orbit splitting of the energy spectrum is neglected in eq .",
    "( [ generation ] ) .    in ( 110)-grown qw structures , components of the larmor frequency of the effective magnetic field",
    "have the form @xmath78 the parameter @xmath79 is caused here by the lack of an inversion center in the host crystal , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 are non - zero due to the qw asymmetry only .",

    "( 001)-grown qws , the time @xmath89 is given by  @xcite @xmath90 where the angle brackets mean averaging over directions of the wave vector . for the boltzmann distribution , eq .",

    "we also note that the modest estimated value of the spin polarization is due to the fact that the energy relaxation by acoustic phonons is ineffective .",
