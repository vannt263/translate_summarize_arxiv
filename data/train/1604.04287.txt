    "topological superconductors with @xmath2-wave pairing and majorana bound states @xcite are currently attracting much interest , motivated in part by possible applications to topological quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "several solid - state platforms have been proposed @xcite and are vigorously pursued experimentally @xcite .",
    "a key question of current research is to develop appropriate detection schemes which allow one to identify topological superconducting phases and majorana bound states .",
    "a particularly striking signature of topological superconductivity is provided by josephson junctions formed by a weak link between two topological superconductors hosting unpaired majorana bound states at their ends @xcite .",
    "while for conventional superconductors , the josephson current is @xmath3 periodic in the applied phase difference , the josephson current across a junction made from topological superconductors is predicted to be @xmath0 periodic @xcite .",
    "this period doubling of the josephson current in a topological josephson junction @xcite is protected by fermion number parity and as such quite sensitive to quasiparticle poisoning which changes the occupation of subgap states by inelastic processes involving the quasiparticle continuum .",
    "if the temporal variation of the superconducting phase difference across the junction is too slow , quasiparticle poisoning restores the @xmath3 periodicity @xcite .",
    "if the phase difference is varied too fast , the periodicity is restored by diabatic transitions into the quasiparticle continuum @xcite .    here , we explore an alternative approach to probe the phase - dependent subgap spectrum of a topological josephson junction , which is inspired by a recent series of remarkable experiments on conventional josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "these experiments consider josephson junctions based on atomic weak links which host localized subgap andreev states .",
    "the experiments explore the phase - dependent subgap spectrum by switching - current measurements as well as microwave spectroscopy . here , we establish that analogous experiments provide a promising technique to distinguish between conventional and topological josephson junctions .",
    "we find that this is particularly true in the short - junction limit , i.e. , for junctions which are short compared to the coherence length of the adjacent ( topological ) superconductors . an important advantage of such measurements is that they can be performed in the presence of quasiparticle poisoning and in fact explicitly exploit processes that break fermion parity .    ideally , josephson junctions carry a dissipationless supercurrent ( or josephson current ) as long as the applied current remains below the critical current and switch to a resistive state once the current exceeds the critical current @xcite . in practice",
    ", the switching current fluctuates about the critical current due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "this has characteristic consequences in switching - current measurements based on applying short current pulses . indeed ,",
    "the switching probability as a function of the height of the applied current pulse does not increase abruptly from zero to one at the critical current , but rather exhibits a smooth step when accounting for fluctuations arising from the electromagnetic environment .",
    "when the junction hosts subgap states , their occupations also fluctuate due to quasiparticle poisoning processes . the current - phase relation and hence the critical current depend on the occupation of the subgap states , so that poisoning processes lead to fluctuations in the switching current .",
    "the effect of poisoning processes is particularly simple when the current pulses are short compared to typical poisoning processes . in this case",
    ", the poisoning dynamics determines the occupation probability of the various subgap states prior to applying the current pulse but does not modify the state during the pulse duration .",
    "the switching probability becomes a superposition of step functions corresponding to the various subgap occupations .",
    "when the broadening of the steps is small compared to the shifts in the switching current between different occupation states , the measured switching probability exhibits a sequence of steps  one for each occupation of the subgap states  with intermediate plateaus .",
    "the heights of the plateaus reflect the occupation probabilities of the various junction states at the beginning of the current pulse . as a consequence , the switching probability encodes information on the current - phase relations for the various occupation states of the josephson junction .",
    "switching - current measurements on a single josephson junction do not provide access to the phase dependence of the josephson current , but merely to the maximal josephson current and its dependence on the junction occupation .",
    "phase - dependent information can be obtained by incorporating the junction of interest into an asymmetric squid where the second auxiliary junction in the squid loop has a much larger critical current and no subgap states @xcite .",
    "this setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.squid ] .",
    "the switching current of the squid is shifted away from the switching current of the large junction by the phase - dependent josephson current of the weak one , so that switching - current measurements as a function of flux can provide access to the entire current - phase relation of the various states of the weak junction of interest .",
    "basic setup of the asymmetric squid , involving a weak conventional / topological josephson junction ( blue triangles ) and a strong auxiliary josephson junction ( red checked box ) with critical current @xmath4 .",
    "the phase @xmath5 across the weak junction is linked to the phase @xmath6 across the auxiliary junction and the phase drop @xmath7 induced by the magnetic flux @xmath8 threading the squid loop , @xmath9 . the applied voltage @xmath10 drives a current @xmath11 through the resistance @xmath12 and the squid.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    this makes switching - current measurements suitable to probe a unique distinction between topological and conventional josephson junctions . as a function of the phase difference @xmath5 across the junction , the difference in josephson currents between different junction states must vanish an even number of times within a @xmath3 period in a trivial junction , and an odd number of times in a topological junction .    in this scheme , the initial occupation probability of the various junction states is assumed thermal . when driving the system out of equilibrium",
    ", switching - current measurements also provide access to the poisoning dynamics @xcite .",
    "imagine that the system is taken out of equilibrium at some initial time @xmath13 so that the occupation probability of the various subgap states is no longer thermal .",
    "poisoning processes will subsequently induce relaxation to equilibrium , and the rate of this relaxation can be probed by switching - current measurements after a time delay @xmath14 .",
    "this pump - probe scheme can either be implemented by a sequence of two current pulses with time delay @xmath14 , or by applying an appropriate microwave pulse at time @xmath13 prior to the switching current measurements at time @xmath14 .",
    "microwave irradiation also provides an alternative spectroscopic way of measuring the subgap spectrum as it induces transitions between different occupation states of the josephson junction by microwave radiation @xcite .",
    "thus , evidence for topological superconductivity can be further strengthened by performing switching - current measurements in conjunction with microwave spectroscopy .",
    "this motivates us to calculate the admittance of a topological josephson junction in the short - junction limit , complementing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the long - junction limit .",
    "such measurements provide various opportunities to distinguish topological from nontopological josephson junctions .",
    "we find that the signatures are particularly distinctive for short junctions as their subgap spectrum contains only few andreev states .",
    "such short topological junctions support only a single subgap state at energy @xmath15 ( and its particle - hole conjugate at @xmath16 ) , originating from the hybridization of the two majorana bound states . in contrast",
    ", a short conventional junction frequently ( but not necessarily ) supports additional andreev states associated with the spin degree of freedom . in this case ,",
    "topological and nontopological junctions can be distinguished by the number of plateaus in the switching probability as a function of applied current .",
    "only junctions with a single plateau are suspects for being topological [ see fig .",
    "[ figwidth](a ) ] . among these suspects ,",
    "the subgap spectrum exhibits a fermion - parity protected level crossing at a phase difference of @xmath17 for topological junctions , and an anticrossing for nontopological junctions .",
    "thus , the josephson current at a phase difference of @xmath18 is maximal for topological junctions and vanishes for conventional ones .",
    "this leads to characteristic differences in the flux dependence of the plateau width [ see fig .",
    "[ figwidth](b ) ] .",
    "finally , even if the anticrossing of a nontopological junction happens to be too weak to be resolved , its poisoning dynamics should be characteristically different .",
    "poisoning dynamics necessarily involves the quasiparticle continuum for topological junctions while poisoning processes involving only subgap states can exist for conventional junctions .",
    "these signatures based on switching current measurements can be further corroborated by microwave spectroscopy .",
