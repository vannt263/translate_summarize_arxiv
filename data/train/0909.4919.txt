    "the origin , presence and nature of dark matter ( dm ) in our universe remains one of the biggest mysteries of the particle physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of dark matter , which accounts for majority of mass in the universe , represents a crucial step in connecting astronomical observations with predictions of various elementary particle theories .",
    "many theories , the extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , predict one or more stable , electrically - neutral particle(s ) in their spectrum , which can be possible dark matter candidate(s ) .",
    "different models provide different assignments for dm particles spin and various windows for their masses and couplings . to test this great variety of hypotheses ,",
    "several techniques for dm direct or indirect search are currently developed .",
    "recent experimental measurements of dark matter relic abundance , @xmath1 by wmap collaboration  @xcite , can be used to place constraints on the masses and interaction strengths of dm particles .",
    "indeed , the relation @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the mass and the interaction strength associated with dm annihilation , implies that , for a weakly - interacting particle , the mass scale should be set around the electroweak scale .",
    "this , coupled with an observation that very light dm particles might overclose the universe ( known as a lee - weinberg limit  @xcite ) , seems to exclude the possibility of light weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) solution for dm , setting @xmath5  gev .",
    "a detailed look at this argument reveals that those constraints can be easily avoided in concrete models , so even mev - scale particles can be good candidates for dm .",
    "for instance , low - energy resonances - such a light cp - odd higgs in the mssm extensions with a higgs singlet , or a light extra gauge u - boson - could enhance the dm annihilation cross - section , without the need for a large coupling constant @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . even if no light resonances exist",
    ", the usual suppression of dm annihilation cross - section , @xmath6 , used in setting the lee - weinberg limit , does not hold , if dark matter is a non - fermionic ( e.g. spin-0 ) state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dm production could be non - thermal  @xcite , in which case the constraint provided by eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) does not apply .",
    "thus , models with light dark matter ( @xmath7 few gev or less ) still deserve a detailed and thorough study .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility of using of @xmath0 meson decays with missing energy , to test the models with a light spin-0 dm particle .",
    "studies of heavy meson ( and in particular @xmath0 meson ) decays with missing energy may be especially valuable in light of the fact that dm direct search experiments , such as dama @xcite , cdms @xcite and xenon @xcite , which rely on the measurement of kinematic recoil of nuclei in dm interactions , lose ( for cold dm particles ) sensitivity with decreasing mass of the wimp , as the recoil energy becomes small .",
    "of course , light dark matter may also be produced at high energy colliders , however the production rate is naturally going to be insensitive to precise value of the wimp mass , if the one is much less than the beam center - of - mass energy @xcite .",
    "indirect experiments , such as hess @xcite , are specifically tuned to see large energy secondaries , only possible for weak - scale wimps .",
    "the backgrounds for positron and antiproton searches by heat @xcite and/or pamela @xcite experiments could be prohibitively large at small energies .",
    "thus , @xmath0 ( and/or other heavy meson ) decays with missing energy may serve as alternative dm search channels , capable to provide us with an information on the wimp mass range , hardly testable by the experiments discussed above .",
    "so far , @xmath0 meson decays into dark matter have been considered within the models , where dm particles interaction with an ordinary matter is mediated by some light degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "apart from desire of having dm annihilation enhancement ( due to a light intermediate resonance ) and thus having no tension with the dm relic abundance condition , it is also known that @xmath0 meson sm decay is predominantly due to strong interactions .",
    "thus , the wimp production branching ratio , in general , is greatly suppressed compared to relevant weak b decays , and in particular to @xmath8 transition @xcite . in light of this",
    ", it might seem natural to concentrate only on the models within which dark matter production in @xmath0 decays is enhanced due to exchange of a light particle propagator .",
    "yet , the aim of the present paper is to study @xmath9 decay into a pair of spin-0 dm particles , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 decay into a pair of spin-0 dm particles and a photon , @xmath12 , within the models where light dark matter interaction with an ordinary matter is due to exchange of _ heavy _ particles ( with masses exceeding the bottomonium mass ) . as it is mentioned above",
    ", these models may be free of tension related to satisfying the dm relic abundance constraint as well .",
    "examples of such models will be discussed below .",
    "also , new experimental data on @xmath0 decays into invisible states have been reported by the babar collaboration @xcite . according to these data , @xmath13 and @xmath14 where the interval in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ i3 ] ) is related to the choice of the final state missing mass .",
    "these bounds are significantly stronger than those on invisible @xmath9 decays ( with or without a photon emission ) , reported previously by belle and cleo @xcite and quoted by particle data group @xcite .",
    "we show here that babar experimental data on @xmath0 meson invisible decays ( without or with a photon emission ) may constrain the parameter space of light scalar dark matter models , even if there is no dark matter production enhancement due to light intermediate states .",
    "we also illustrate ( in sections  [ s5 ]  and  [ s4 ] ) that the study of dark matter production in @xmath0 decays allows us to test regions of parameter space of light spin-0 dm models that are inaccessible for b meson decays with missing energy .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that @xmath0 decays are sensitive to a wider range of wimp mass than b decays .",
    "thus , the study of wimp production in @xmath0 decays is complementary to that for b meson decays .    within the models where scalar dm consists of particles that are their own antiparticles , only @xmath15 transition is relevant .",
    "the transition rate of @xmath16 vanishes , if @xmath17 . indeed , by angular momentum conservation",
    ", the produced dm particles pair in @xmath18 decay must be in a p - wave state , which is impossible because of the bose - einstein symmetry of identical spin-0 particles .",
    "the scenarios with light complex scalar dark matter , albeit implying some continuous symmetry related to the internal charge of the complex ( electrically ) neutral scalar field , may be realized in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "some of the models allow the scenarios both with a real and with a complex light scalar dm field @xcite . within these models ,",
    "study of the decay @xmath10 represents an excellent opportunity to test the dm field nature either at present or in the future ( if higher experimental resolution is needed ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we restrict ourselves to the class of models where light spin-0 dm production is mediated by heavy degrees of freedom . at the energy scales , associated with @xmath0",
    "decays , heavy intermediate degrees of freedom may be integrated out , thus leading to a low - energy effective theory of four - particle interactions .",
    "our strategy would be deriving first model - independent formulae for the @xmath19 and @xmath12 branching ratios within the low - energy effective theory .",
    "then , we confront our predictions with the experimental data , deriving model - independent bounds in terms of the wilson operator expansion coefficients as the parameters that carry the information on an underlying new physics ( np ) model .",
    "finally , within a given model , using the matching conditions for the wilson coefficients , we translate these bounds into those on the relevant parameters of the considered model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "the general formalism is developed and model - independent formulae for the @xmath19 and @xmath12 branching ratios are derived .",
    "both the case of complex and the case of self - conjugate dm field are considered . in section  [ s7 ] the neutrino background effect",
    "is discussed .",
    "we show that it has negligible impact on our analysis . in section  [ s8 ]",
    "we confront our calculation results with the experimental data and derive model - independent bounds on the wilson coefficients . in the next sections we transform these bounds into constraints on the parameters of particular models . in section  [ s5 ]",
    "models with a complex spin-0 dm field are considered .",
    "we choose the class of mirror fermion models as an example .",
    "these models include , in particular , gauge mediated susy breaking scenarios with the dm particle in the hidden sector and the mirror fermions being connectors between the hidden and the mssm sectors @xcite .",
    "an example of the self - conjugate dm scenario , two - higgs doublet model with a scalar dm particle , is considered in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "we treat @xmath0 states - neglecting the sea quark and gluon distributions - as bound states of @xmath20 valence quark - antiquark pair that annihilates - with or without emission of a photon - into a pair of dark matter particles . to this approximation",
    ", the relevant low - energy effective hamiltonian may be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heavy mass and    @xmath23    with @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth noting that with the notations used in ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) , all the operators @xmath25 , i=1, .. 4 , are hermitean , thus all the wilson coefficients @xmath26 must be real .",
    "another point to be made is that the @xmath26 are low - energy renormalization scale - independent .",
    "this stems from the renormalization scale invariance of the hadronic parts of operators @xmath25 , which - combined with the fact that dm particles do not interact strongly or electromagnetically - leads to low - energy scale invariance of @xmath25 and ( from the scale invariance of the effective hamiltonian ) to that of @xmath26 . if dm consists of particles that are their own antiparticles , then only first two operators in eq .",

    "( [ g2 ] ) , is the most general one for the @xmath10 transition . with the use of the same basis , the other decay , @xmath12 , occurs by means of bi - local interactions depicted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ]  ( a ) ,  ( b ) . in principle",
    ", it is also possible - if the intermediate heavy states are ( electrically ) charged - that both the photon and the dm particles originate from the same effective vertex ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ]  ( c ) ) . in order to take into account this diagram , higher dimension operators , involving electromagnetic field tensor ,",
    "should also be included .",
    "however , such higher dimension operators would enter the expression for @xmath27 with higher powers of @xmath28 factor .",
    "extra suppression of diagram in fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) in powers of the heavy mass inverse may be seen from the fact that one must introduce an extra heavy propagator or , equivalently , an extra power of @xmath28 or @xmath29 , as the photon is emitted by a heavy intermediate degree of freedom .",
    "thus , one may neglect contribution of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) , as compared to that of the other two diagrams .",
    "this justifies the use of the operators basis , given by eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) , for @xmath12 decay as well .    in the rest frame of @xmath0 meson ,",

    "although the tensor current @xmath36 is not present in ( [ g2 ] ) , it inevitably appears in calculations of the @xmath12 amplitude .",
    "thus , we need this current matrix element parametrization as well . also , it is worth mentioning that @xmath37 due to the vector current conservation .",

    "thus , one neglects @xmath45 difference between @xmath44 and @xmath46 as well as the quark - antiquark fermi motion effects .",
    "let us proceed to the transition amplitudes and rates .",

    "thus , within the type  ii 2hdm with a light spin-0 dark matter , study of @xmath15 decay channel may lead to severe constraints on the lightest cp - even higgs invisible decay coupling , if that higgs is new - physics like .    as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ l9 ] ) , bound ( [ l5 ] ) on @xmath291 may also be transformed into that on the couplings @xmath282 , @xmath283 and @xmath281 .",
    "constraints on @xmath282 and/or @xmath283 may also be derived from the study of @xmath303 transition @xcite .",
    "those , in general , are strong enough : in particular , @xmath201 values of @xmath282 and @xmath283 for @xmath304 are ruled out , if @xmath305 . in that case , @xmath306 suppressed terms in eq .",
    "( [ l9 ] ) may safely be neglected , so that @xmath307 . in other words , bound ( [ l5 ] ) on @xmath291",
    "is also that on @xmath308 , if @xmath305 .",
    "note that due to cancellation effects in the relevant diagrams , wimp pair production rate in b meson decays is insensitive to the value of @xmath281 @xcite , and hence , in general , to the value of @xmath278 .",
    "the scenarios with @xmath281 dominant , or at least non - negligible , have been thus far unconstrained . to our best knowledge , bound on the @xmath277 interaction coupling , @xmath278 ,",
    "is derived for the first time .",
    "thus , study of dm production in @xmath0 decays enables one to test the regions of the parameter space of 2hdm with scalar dark matter , which are inaccessible by b meson decays with missing energy .",
    "it may seem naively that the rigorous constraint on the @xmath277 interaction coupling , @xmath278 , results also to suppress the dm annihilation rate , which in its turn may lead to scenarios with overabundant dark matter .",
    "yet , the dm annihilation rate to down - type quarks and charged leptons is enhanced by a factor of @xmath309 ( due to @xmath177 enhancement of these fermions yukawa interaction with the cp - even higgs , if the one is np - like ) . or , equivalently , using the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective coupling for these annihilation processes is @xmath310 in terms of the coupling @xmath311 , bound ( [ l5 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath312 keeping in mind that @xmath313 or , equivalently , @xmath314 , bound ( [ l6 ] ) on @xmath311 yields no essential constraints on dm annihilation and , hence , no tension with satisfying dm relic abundance constraint above the lee - weinberg limit of the model , @xmath315 @xcite .",
    "thus , the 2hdm scenario with @xmath281 dominant , or at least non - negligible , is much less restrained , than those with @xmath282 or @xmath283 dominant or than minimal scalar dm model @xcite .",
    "so far it has been assumed that the lightest cp - even higgs boson is np - like . in the opposite case , when @xmath263 is the sm - like ( case a ) , the matching between the full and effective theories yields @xmath316 in deriving ( [ t6 ] ) , we used , for @xmath262 and @xmath272 , @xmath317 it is not hard to see from our further analysis that omitted @xmath284 terms in eqs .",
    "( [ t17 ] ) are not essential in this case .    the first term in the expression for @xmath318 is due to the sm - like higgs exchange . as expected , it has no enhancement factor - thus , as it was discussed in section  [ s8 ] , contribution of this term to the @xmath93 rate is by ( at least ) an order of magnitude lower than the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "we may further disregard the dark matter interaction with the lightest cp - even higgs @xmath263 .",
    "then , we may rewrite matching conditions ( [ t6 ] ) in a more transparent form : @xmath319    in other words , we restrict ourselves by considering the contribution to @xmath93 amplitude due to exchange of the heaviest ( np - like ) higgs boson only .",
    "this contribution is enhanced by @xmath177 factor , coming from @xmath320 yukawa interaction coupling in ( [ t13 ] ) ( if @xmath321 ) .",
    "the remarkable feature of the considered scenario is that even though @xmath93 transition is generated by exchange of the heaviest cp - even higgs boson , the decay branching ratio for a certain range of @xmath264 mass is well within the reach of the present experimental sensitivity , due to @xmath309 enhancement . as a consequence ,",
    "one may derive constraints on the coupling @xmath281 , as a function of @xmath322 , @xmath50 and @xmath177 .    indeed , using eqs .",
    "( [ t22 ] ) , one may rewrite bound ( [ g27 ] ) on @xmath186 as @xmath323 choosing @xmath324 as a reference value is not accidental . within the general type  ii 2hdm , theoretical upper bound restricts the sm - like higgs to be less than 180 gev @xcite .",
    "also , the sm higgs mass interval @xmath325 has been recently excluded with 95% c. l. by the cdf and d0 data @xcite .",

( [ t18 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) , for @xmath324 and @xmath326 , @xmath281 is constrained to be of order of the sm weak coupling or smaller ( @xmath330 ) , if @xmath331 .",
    "also , for the same choice of the higgs mass and @xmath177 , @xmath308 is to be less than one , if the wimp mass is less than 2 gev . bound on @xmath308",
    "is significantly more rigorous for higher values of @xmath177 .",
    "for instance , if choosing @xmath300 , one gets @xmath332 and @xmath333 for @xmath331 and @xmath334 respectively .",
    "the restrictions on @xmath308 are essential also for higher values of the heaviest cp - even higgs mass : for @xmath327 , they are still of interest up to @xmath335 , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ f5](b ) .",
    "our analysis may be spread for the @xmath336 range as well , leading to more rigorous constraints than those in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] .    recall that bound on @xmath308 is derived for the first time .",
    "it is also worth noting that constraints on @xmath308 imply also those on the heaviest cp - even higgs invisible decay rate , if that higgs is np - like . as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ t17 ] ) , @xmath281 is the @xmath337 interaction coupling in this case . yet , as in the case ( b ) , bound ( [ t18 ] ) does not seem to have an impact on the dm annihilation rate ( which is @xmath309 enhanced ) .",
    "vice versa , dm annihilation processes ( and possibly scattering off nucleons ) may lead to additional constraints on @xmath281 .",
    "study of these processes , however , goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "thus , within type  ii 2hdm with a scalar dark matter , for large @xmath177 scenario , @xmath0 meson decay into a dark matter particles pair and a photon , @xmath338 , may be used to derive essential constraints on the parameters of the model , which otherwise can not be tested by b meson decays with invisible outcoming particles .",
    "thus , spin-0 dark matter production in @xmath0 meson decays has been investigated .",
    "we restricted ourselves by consideration of the models where the decays occur due to exchange of heavy non - resonant degrees of freedom .",
    "both the scenarios with a complex scalar dm field and those with dm particle being its own antiparticle have been analyzed .",
    "we performed our calculations within low - energy effective theory , integrating out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "this way we derived model - independent formulae for the considered branching ratios .",
    "we used these formulae to confront our theoretical predictions with existing experimental data on invisible @xmath0 decays , both in a model - independent way and within particular models .",
    "it has been shown that within the considered class of models , dm production rate in @xmath0 decays is within the reach of the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "thus , @xmath0 meson decays into dark matter , with or without a photon emission , may be used to constrain the models with a gev or lighter spin-0 dm . in particular , within the mirror fermion models , using the existing babar constraint on the @xmath94 mode , we derived for the first time bounds on the parameters of the model that otherwise could not be tested by other dm search processes .    experimental constraints on the other mode , @xmath95 , are derived assuming that dark matter is produced by exchange of a light resonant scalar state . within the scenarios with non - resonant dm production",
    ", these constraints may be used only to make preliminary estimates of possible bounds on the parameters of the models . yet",
    ", those estimates show that these bounds may be rigorous enough ; besides , they are derived within the least restrained presently light scalar dm scenarios .",
    "our goal is thus to encourage the experimental groups to analyze the experimental data on @xmath86 also for the case of non - monochromatic photon emission and spin-0 invisible states .",
    "so , from our analysis one may conclude that dark matter production in @xmath0 meson decays may serve as an interesting alternative to commonly used dm search methods , capable of providing a valuable information on dm particles , if those turn to have a mass of the order of a few gev or smaller .",
