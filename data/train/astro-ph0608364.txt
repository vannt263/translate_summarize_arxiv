    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) were discovered assources of short intense bursts of gamma - rays , and for a long time were considered as a puzzling category of gamma - ray bursts .",

    "however , the  observations are not ideal to accurately measure the flux and spectrum of these relatively faint sources located in crowded fields of the galactic plane , since its non - imaging instruments suffer from source confusion and large uncertainties in the background estimate .",

    "the hard x - ray emission , well fit by a power law with photon index @xmath131.51.9 , seems to correlate in hardness and intensity with the rate of burst emission , that reached a maximum in fall 2004 .    the bursting activity of  culminated with the giant flare of 2004 december 27 @xcite , that produced the strongest flash of gamma - rays at the earth ever observed .",

    "other observations of this exceptional event , and their implications for the physics of neutron stars , are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite . comparing this giant flare with those seen from  and , it is found that the energy in the pulsating tails of the three events was roughly of the same order ( @xmath14 ergs ) , while the energy in the initial spike of  ( a few @xmath15 ergs ) was at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of the other giant flares .",

    "these @xmath630 ks long observations , whose main target was igr j163584726 , were carried out in february and september 2004 .",

    "this is particularly important for high n@xmath28 values and small fluxes , as in the case of .",
    "the long term luminosity decrease of  was interpreted as evidence for cooling of the neutron star surface after the deep crustal heating that occurred during the period of sgr activity in 1998 .",
    "the decay light curve was fitted with a model of deep crustal heating requiring a massive neutron star ( m@xmath311.5 @xmath32 ) which could well explain a plateau seen between days 400 and 800 @xcite .",

    "up to now limited spectral information has been obtained for sgr bursts below 20 kev . in particular , before our  observations , spectra with good energy resolution and sensitivity at a few kev were lacking . however , some studies have provided evidence that the optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model , which gives a good phenomenological description of the burst spectra in the hard x - ray range , is inconsistent with the data below @xcite .",
    "we therefore tried to address this issue using the  data .",
    "several tens of bursts were detected during some of the observations of  ( while none was seen in  and ) .",
    "these bursts had durations typical of the short bursts more commonly observed at higher energy . since the individual bursts had too few counts for a meaningful spectral analysis , we extracted a cumulative spectrum by summing all the bursts detected during the 2004 observations .",
    "the resulting spectrum corresponds to a total exposure of 12.7 s and contains about 2000 net counts in the 210 kev range .",
    "we checked that pile - up effects were not important ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the spectrum of the remaining observing time was used as background .",
    "all the fits with simple models ( power law , blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung ) gave formally acceptable @xmath36 values , but the power law and the bremsstrahlung required a large absorption ( n@xmath28=10@xmath37 @xmath21 ) , inconsistent with the value seen in the persistent emission .",
    "we therefore favor the blackbody model , which yields kt@xmath38=2.3@xmath10.2 kev and n@xmath28=6@xmath310@xmath39 @xmath21 , in agreement with the value determined from the spectrum of the persistent emission .",
    "the residuals from this best fit showed a deviation at .",
    "although the deviation is formally at 3.3@xmath40 , it could not be reproduced in spectra obtained with different data selections and binning criteria .",

    "in models involving ultra - magnetized neutron stars , proton cyclotron features are expected to lie in the x - ray range , for surface magnetic fields strengths of @xmath41  g. detailed calculations of the spectrum emerging from the atmospheres of magnetars in quiescence have confirmed this basic expectation @xcite .",
    "model spectra exhibit a strong absorption line at the proton cyclotron resonance , @xmath42 kev , where @xmath43 , typically in the 0.700.85 range , is the gravitational red - shift at the neutron star surface .",

    "magnetars might differ from ordinary radio pulsars because their magnetospheres are highly twisted and therefore can support current flows @xcite .",
    "the presence of charged particles ( @xmath44 and ions ) produces a large resonant scattering depth and since i ) the electron distribution is spatially extended and ii ) the resonant frequency depends on the local value of the magnetic field , repeated scatterings could lead to the formation of a hard tail instead of a narrow line .",
    "a different explanation involves vacuum polarization effects .",
    "it has been calculated that in strongly magnetized atmospheres this effect can significantly reduce the equivalent width of cyclotron lines , thus making difficult their detection @xcite .",
    "many of the results presented above fit reasonably well with the magnetar model interpretation . however , there are also a few aspects that require more theoretical and observational efforts to be interpreted in this framework , in particular when one considers the variety of different behaviors shown by these sources and their close relatives like the anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite .    the long term variations seen in , thesource observed more often with , are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the magnetar model involving a twisted magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , according to this model , resonant scattering from magnetospheric currents leads to the formation of a high - energy tail .",
    "a gradually increasing twist results in a larger optical depth that causes a hardening of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "at the same time , the spin down rate increases because , for a fixed dipole field , the fraction of field lines that open out across the speed of light cylinder grows .",
    "in addition , the stresses building up in the neutron star crust and the magnetic footprints movements lead to crustal fractures causing an increase in the bursting activity . since spectral hardening , spin - down rate , and bursting rate increase with the twist angle , it is not surprising that these quantities varied in a correlated way in  ( see fig .  [ 1806 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "however , as visible in fig .",
    "[ 1806 ] , while the spectral hardening took place gradually over several years , the spin - down variation occurred more rapidly in 2000 .",
    "a recent analysis of  data around the time of the giant flare @xcite shows that the correlation between spectral and variability parameters is indeed rather complex .    the long term flux evolution of  is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that , excluding the enhancements seen in correspondence of the flares , the luminosity remained always at the same level in the years 19972001 , and then decreased slightly until the lowest value seen with  in september 2005 .",
    "the following observation of april 2006 showed that the decreasing luminosity trend has been interrupted by the recent onset of bursts emission .",
    "however , the moderate flux increase was not associated with significant changes in the x - ray spectral and timing properties , probably because the source is , up to now , only moderately active .",
    "the luminosity now reached by , is the smallest ever observed from a sgr , and is similar to that of the low state of the transient anomalous x - ray pulsar xte j1810@xmath23197 @xcite .",
    "this low luminosity might be related to the long period ( @xmath66 years ) during which  has not emitted bursts .",
    "however , the behavior of this source differs from that of the other sgrs that during periods of apparent lack of bursts changed only moderately their luminosity .",
    "in fact no bursts were detected from  in the three years preceding the  observations : had its luminosity decreased with the same trend exhibited by  it would have been much fainter than observed by .",
    "even more striking is the case of , which has a high luminosity ( @xmath45 erg s@xmath5 ) , despite no signs of bursting activity have been observed in the last 15 years ( unless weak bursts from this source have passed undetected due to its larger distance and location in a poorly monitored sky region ) .",
    "it thus seems that , similarly to the case of anomalous x - ray pulsars , sgrs comprise both `` persistent '' sources ( ,  and  ) and `` transients '' (  ) .",
    "the reasons behind this difference are currently unclear and not necessarily the same that differentiate between sgrs and axps .",
