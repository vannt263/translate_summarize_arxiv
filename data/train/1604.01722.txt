    "in the last decade , thousands of planets are discovered in our galaxy alone .",
    "the inference is that stars with planets are a rule rather than exception @xcite , with estimates of the actual number of planet exceeding the number of stars in our galaxy by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the same line of reasoning suggests a staggering number of at least @xmath0 planets in the observable universe .",
    "the biggest question posed therefore is whether there are other life - harbouring planets .",
    "the most fundamental interest is in finding the earth s twin .",
    "in fact , _ kepler _ space telescope ( ) was designed specifically to look for earth s analog  earth - size planets in the habitable zones ( hz ) of g - type stars @xcite . more and more evidence accumulated in the last few years suggests that , in astrophysical context , earth is an average planet , with average chemistry , existing in many other places in the galaxy , average mass and pressure .",
    "moreover , recent discovery of the rich organic content in the protoplanetary disk of newly formed star mwc 480 @xcite has shown that neither is our solar system unique in the abundance of the key components for life .",
    "yet the only habitable planet in the universe known to us is our earth .",
    "the question of habitability is of such interest and importance that the theoretical work has expanded from just the stellar hz concept to the galactic hz ( gonzales 2001 ) and , recently , to the universe hz  asking a question which galaxies are more habitable than others ( dayal et al .",
    "2015 ) . however , the simpler question  which of thousands detected planets are , or can be , habitable is still not answered . life on other planets ,",
    "if exists , may be similar to what we have on our planet , or may be in some other unknown form .",
    "the answer to this question may depend on understanding how different physical planetary parameters , such as planet s orbital properties , its chemical composition , mass , radius , density , surface and interior temperature , distance from it s parent star , even parent star s temperature or mass , combine to provide habitable conditions . with currently more than 1800 confirmed and more than 4000 unconfirmed discoveries , there is already enormous amount of accumulated data , where the challenge lies in the selection of how much to study about each planet , and which parameters are of the higher priority to evaluate .",
    "several important characteristics were introduced to address the habitability question .",
    "@xcite first addressed this issue through two indices , the planetary habitability index ( phi ) and the earth similarity index ( esi ) , where maximum is set as 1 for a planet where life as we know it had formed ; thus for the earth , phi@xmath1esi@xmath2 .",
    "esi represents a quantitative measure with which to assess the similarity of a planet with the earth on the basis of mass , size and temperature .",
    "but esi alone is insufficient to conclude about the habitability , as planets like mars have esi close to 0.8 but we can not still categorize it as habitable .",
    "there is also a possibility that a planet with esi value slightly less than 1 may harbor life in some form which is not there on earth , i.e. unknown to us .",
    "phi was quantitatively defined as a measure of the ability of a planet to develop and sustain life . however , evaluating phi values for large number of planets is not an easy task . in @xcite ,",
    "another parameter was introduced to account for the chemical composition of exoplanets and some biology - related features such as substrate , energy , geophysics , temperature and age of the planet  the biological complexity index ( bci ) . here",
    ", we briefly describe the mathematical forms of these parameters .",
    "[ [ earth - similarity - index - esi ] ] * earth similarity index ( esi ) * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    esi was designed to indicate how earth - like an exoplanet might be @xcite and is an important factor to initially assess the habitability measure .",
    "its value lies between 0 ( no similarity ) and 1 , where 1 is the reference value , i.e. the esi value of the earth , and a general rule is that any planetary body with an esi over 0.8 can be considered an earth - like .",
    "it was proposed in the form @xmath3 where esi@xmath4 is the esi value of a planet for @xmath5 property , and @xmath6 is the earth s value for that property . the final esi value of the planet is obtained by combining the geometric means of individual values , where @xmath7 is the weighting component through which the sensitivity of scale is adjusted .",
    "four parameters : surface temperature @xmath8 , density @xmath9 , escape velocity @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 , are used in esi calculation .",
    "this index is split into interior @xmath12 ( calculated from radius and density ) , and surface @xmath13 ( calculated from escape velocity and surface temperature ) .",
    "their geometric means are taken to represent the final @xmath14 of a planet .",
    "however , esi in the form ( [ eq : esigeneral ] ) was not introduced to define habitability , it only describes the similarity to the earth in regard to some planetary parameters .",
    "for example , it is relatively high for the moon .    [ [ planetary - habitability - index - phi ] ] * planetary habitability index ( phi ) * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to actually address the habitability of a planet , @xcite defined the phi as @xmath15 where @xmath16 defines a substrate , @xmath17  the available energy , @xmath18  the appropriate chemistry and @xmath19  the liquid medium ; all the variables here are in general vectors , while the corresponding scalars represent the norms of these vectors . for each of these categories ,",
    "the phi value is divided by the maximum phi to provide the normalized phi in the scale between 0 to 1 .",
    "however , phi in the form ( [ eq : phigeneral ] ) lacks some other properties of a planet which may be necessary for determining its present habitability .",
    "for example , in shchekinov et al .",
    "( 2013 ) it was suggested to complement the original phi with the explicit inclusion of the age of the planet ( see their eq .",
    "[ [ biological - complexity - index - bci ] ] * biological complexity index ( bci ) * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to come even closer to defining habitability , yet another index was introduced , comprising the above mentioned four parameters of the phi and three extra parameters , such as geophysical complexity @xmath20 , appropriate temperature @xmath21 and age @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total of seven parameters were initially considered to be important for the bci . however , due to the lack of information on chemical composition and the existence of liquid water on exoplanets , only five were retained in the final formulation , @xmath23 it was found in @xcite that for 5 exoplanets the bci value is higher than for mars , and that planets with high bci values may have low values of esi .",
    "all previous indicators for habitability assume a planet to reside within in a classical hz of a star , which is conservatively defined as a region where a planet can support liquid water on the surface @xcite .",
    "the concept of an hz is , however , a constantly evolving one , and it has have been since suggested that a planet may exist beyond the classical hz and still be a good candidate for habitability @xcite .",
    "though presently all efforts are in search for the earth s twin where the esi is an essential parameter , it never tells that a planet with esi close to @xmath24 is habitable .",
    "much advertised recent hype in press about finding the best bet for life - supporting planet ",
    "gliese 832c with esi @xmath25 @xcite , was thwarted by the realization that the planet is more likely to be a super - venus , with large thick atmosphere , hot surface and probably tidally locked with its star .",
    "we present here the novel approach to determine the habitability score of all confirmed exoplanets analytically .",
    "our goal is to determine the likelihood of an exoplanet to be habitable using the newly defined habitability score ( cdhs ) based on cobb - douglas habitability production function ( cd - hpf ) , which computes the habitability score by using measured and calculated planetary input parameters . here",
    ", the phi in its original form turned out to be a special case .",
    "we are looking for a feasible solution that maximizes habitability scores using cd - hpf with some defined constraints . in the following sections , the proposed model and motivations behind our work are discussed along with the results and applicability of the method .",
    "we conclude by listing key takeaways and robustness of the method .",
    "the related derivations and proofs are included in the appendices .",
    "we first present key definitions and terminologies that are utilized in this paper .",
    "these terms play critical roles in understanding the method and the algorithm adopted to accomplish our goal of validating the habitability score , * cdhs * , by using cd - hpf eventually .      * * mathematical optimization * + optimization is one of the procedures to select the best element from a set of available alternatives in the field of mathematics , computer science , economics , or management science @xcite .",
    "an optimization problem can be represented in various ways .",
    "below is the representation of an optimization problem . given a function @xmath26 from a set @xmath22 to the real numbers",
    "if an element @xmath27 in @xmath22 is such that @xmath28 for all @xmath5 in @xmath22 , this ensures minimization .",
    "the case @xmath29 for all @xmath5 in @xmath22 is the specific case of maximization .",
    "the optimization technique is particularly useful for modeling the habitability score in our case . in the above formulation , the domain @xmath22",
    "is called a search space of the function @xmath30 , cd - hpf in our case , and elements of @xmath22 are called the candidate solutions , or feasible solutions .",
    "the function as defined by us is a utility function , yielding the habitability score cdhs .",
    "it is a feasible solution that maximizes the objective function , and is called an optimal solution under the constraints known as * returns to scale*. * * returns to scale * measure the extent of an additional output obtained when all input factors change proportionally .",
    "there are three types of returns to scale : 1 .   * increasing returns to scale ( irs)*. in this case , the output increases by a larger proportion than the increase in inputs during the production process .",
    "for example , when we multiply the amount of every input by the number @xmath31 , the factor by which output increases is more than @xmath31 .",
    "this change occurs as a.   greater application of the variable factor ensures better utilization of the fixed factor .",
    "b.   better division of the variable factor . c.   it improves coordination between the factors .",
    "+ the 3d plots obtained in this case are neither concave nor convex .",
    "* decreasing returns to scale ( drs)*. here , the proportion of increase in input increases the output , but in lower ratio , during the production process .",
    "for example , when we multiply the amount of every input by the number @xmath31 , the factor by which output increases is less than @xmath31 .",
    "this happens because : a.   as more and more units of a variable factor are combined with the fixed factor , the latter gets over - utilized .",
    "hence , the rate of corresponding growth of output goes on diminishing .",
    "b.   factors of production are imperfect substitutes of each other .",
    "the divisibility of their units is not comparable . c.   the coordination between factors",
    "get distorted so that marginal product of the variable factor declines .",
    "+ the 3d plots obtained in this case are concave .",
    "* constant returns to scale ( crs)*. here , the proportion of increase in input increases output in the same ratio , during the production process .",
    "for example , when we multiply the amount of every input by a number @xmath31 , the resulting output is multiplied by @xmath31 .",
    "this phase happens for a negligible period of time and can be considered as a passing phase between irs and drs .",
    "the 3d plots obtained in this case are concave . * * computational techniques in optimization*. there exist several well - known techniques including simplex , newton - like and interior point - based techniques @xcite .",
    "one such technique is implemented via matlab s optimization toolbox using the function * fmincon*. this function helps find the global optima of a constrained optimization problem which is relevant to the model proposed and implemented by the authors .",
    "illustration of the function and its syntax are provided in appendix  d. * * concavity*. concavity ensures global maxima .",
    "the implication of this fact in our case is that if cd - hpf is proved to be concave under some constraints ( this will be elaborated later in the paper ) , we are guaranteed to have maximum habitability score for each exoplanet in the global search space . * * machine learning*. classification of patterns based on data is a prominent and critical component of machine learning and will be highlighted in subsequent part of our work where we made use of a standard k - nn algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is modified to tailor to the complexity and efficacy of the proposed solution .",
    "optimization , as mentioned above , is the art of finding maximum and minimum of surfaces that arise in models utilized in science and engineering .",
    "more often than not , the optimum has to be found in an efficient manner , i.e. both the speed of convergence and the order of accuracy should be appreciably good .",
    "machines are trained to do this job as , most of the times , the learning process is iterative .",
    "machine learning is a set of methods and techniques that are intertwined with optimization techniques .",
    "the learning rate could be accelerated as well , making optimization problems deeply relevant and complementary to machine learning .",
    "the general form of the cobb - douglas production function cd - pf is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant that can be set arbitrarily according to the requirement , @xmath34 is the total production , i.e. output , which is homogeneous with the degree 1 ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the input parameters ( or factors ) ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the real fixed factors , called the elasticity coefficients .",
    "the sum of elasticities determines returns to scale conditions in the cdpf .",
    "this value can be less than 1 , equal to 1 , or greater than 1 .",
    "what motivates us to use the cobb - douglas production function is its properties .",
    "cobb - douglas production function ( cobb & douglas , 1928 ) was originally introduced for modeling the growth of the american economy during the period of 18991922 , and is currently widely used in economics and industry to optimize the production while minimizing the costs @xcite .",
    "cobb - douglas production function is concave if the sum of the elasticities is not greater than one ( see the proof in bergstrom 2010 ) .",
    "this gives global extrema in a closed interval which is handled by constraints in elasticity .",
    "the physical parameters used in the cobb - douglas model may change over time and , as such , may be modeled as continuous entities . a functional representation ,",
    "i.e response , @xmath34 , is thus a continuous function , and may increase or decrease in maximum or minimum value as these parameters change .",
    "our formulation serves this purpose , where elasticities may be adjusted via _",
    "fmincon _ or fitting algorithms , in conjunction with the intrinsic property of the cd - hpf that ensures global maxima for concavity .",
    "our simulations , that include animation and graphs , support this trend ( see figures 1 and 2 in section  3 ) . as the physical parameters change in value , so do the function values and its maximum for all the exoplanets in the catalog , and this might rearrange the cdhs pattern with possible changes in the parameters , while maintaining consistency with the database .",
    "the most important properties of this function that make it flexible to be used in various applications are :    * it can be transformed to the log - linear form from its multiplicative form ( non - linear ) which makes it simple to handle , and hence , linear regression techniques can be used for estimation of missing data . * any proportional change in any input parameter can be represented easily as the change in the output . *",
    "the ratio of relative inputs @xmath35 and @xmath36 to the total output @xmath34 is represented by the elasticities @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the analytical properties of the cd - hpf motivated us to check the applicability in our problem , where the four parameters considered to estimate the habitability score are surface temperature , escape velocity , radius and density . here , the production function @xmath34 is the habitability score of the exoplanet , where the aim is to maximize @xmath34 , subject to the constraint that the sum of all elasticity coefficients shall be less than or equal to 1 .",
    "computational optimization is relevant for elasticity computation in our problem .",
    "elasticity is the percentage change in the output @xmath34 , given one percent change in the input parameter , @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "we assume @xmath33 is constant .",
    "in other words , we compute the rate of change of output @xmath34 , the cd - hpf , with respect to one unit of change in input , such as @xmath39 or @xmath36 . as the quantity of @xmath35 or @xmath40 increases by one percent , output increases by @xmath37 or @xmath38 percent .",
    "this is known as the elasticity of output with respect to an input parameter .",
    "as it is , values of the elasticity , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not ad - hoc and need to be approximated for optimization purpose by some computational technique .",
    "the method , _ fmincon _ with interior point search , is used to compute the elasticity values for crs , drs and irs .",
    "the outcome is quick and accurate .",
    "we elaborate the significance of the scales and elasticity in the context of cd - hpf and cdhs below",
    ". +    * * increasing returns to scale ( irs ) : * in cobb - douglas model , if @xmath41 , the case is called an irs .",
    "it improves the coordination among the factors .",
    "this is indicative of boosting the habitability score following the model with one unit of change in respective predictor variables . *",
    "* decreasing returns to scale ( drs ) : * in cobb - douglas model , if @xmath42 , the case is called a drs , where the deployment of an additional input may affect the output with diminishing rate .",
    "this implies the habitability score following the model may decrease with the one unit of change in respective predictor variables . * * constant returns to scale ( crs ) : * in cobb - douglas model , if @xmath43 , this case is called a crs , where increase in @xmath37 or / and @xmath38 increases the output in the same proportion .",
    "the habitability score , i.e the response variable in the cobb - douglas model , grows proportionately with changes in input or predictor variables .",
    "the range of elasticity constants is between 0 and 1 for drs and crs .",
    "this will be exploited during the simulation phase ( section  3 ) .",
    "it is proved in appendices b and c that the habitability score ( cdhs ) maximization is accomplished in this phase for * drs and crs * , respectively .",
    "the impact of change in the habitability score according to each of the above constraints will be elaborated in sections @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "our aim is to optimize elasticity coefficients to maximize the habitability score of the confirmed exoplanets using the cd - hpf .",
    "we have considered the same four parameters used in the esi metric ( eq .  [ eq : esigeneral ] ) , i.e. surface temperature , escape velocity , radius and density , to calculate the cobb - douglas habitability score ( cdhs ) .",
    "analogous to the method used in esi , two types of cobb - douglas habitability scores are calculated  the interior cdhs@xmath46 and the surface cdhs@xmath46 .",
    "the final score is computed by a linear convex combination of these two , since it is well known that a convex combination of convex / concave function is also convex / concave .",
    "the interior cdhs@xmath46 , denoted by @xmath47 , is calculated using radius @xmath11 and density @xmath9 , @xmath48 the surface cdhs@xmath49 , denoted by @xmath50 , is calculated using surface temperature @xmath8 and escape velocity @xmath10 , @xmath51 the final cdhs @xmath34 , which is a convex combination of @xmath47 and @xmath50 , is determined by @xmath52 where the sum of @xmath53 and @xmath54 equals @xmath24 .",
    "the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the weights of the interior cdhs@xmath46 and surface cdhs@xmath49 , respectively .",
    "these weights depend on the importance of individual parameters of each exoplanet .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath50 are obtained by applying cd - hpf ( eq .  [ eq : cdpf ] ) with @xmath55 .",
    "finally , the cobb - douglas habitability production function can be formally written as @xmath56 the goal is to maximize @xmath34 , iff @xmath57 .",
    "the ease of visualization is the reason * cdhs * is computed by splitting into two parts @xmath47 and @xmath50 and combining by using the weights @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "individually , each of @xmath47 and @xmath50 are sample 3d models and , as such , are easily comprehensible via surface plots as demonstrated later ( see figs .  1 and 2 in section  3 ) .",
    "the authors would like to emphasize that instead of splitting and computing @xmath34 as a convex combination of @xmath47 and @xmath50 , a direct calculation of @xmath34 is possible , which does not alter the final outcome .",
    "it is avoided here , since using the product of all four parameters with corresponding elasticities @xmath58 and @xmath59 would make rendering the plots impossible for the simple reason of dimensionality being too high , @xmath45 instead of @xmath60 .",
    "we reiterate that the scalability of the model from @xmath61 to @xmath58 and @xmath59 does not suffer due to this scheme .",
    "the proof presented in appendix  b bears testimony to our claim .",
    "* statement : * cd - hpf attains global maxima in the phase of drs or crs @xcite . + _ sketch of proof _ : generally profit of a firm can be defined as @xmath62    let @xmath63 be a vector of prices for outputs , or products , and @xmath64 be a vector of prices for inputs of the firm , which are always constants ; and let the input levels be @xmath65 , and the output levels be @xmath66 .",
    "the profit , generated by the production plan , ( @xmath67 ) is @xmath68 suppose the production function for @xmath69 inputs is @xmath70 and its profit function is @xmath71 a single output function needs @xmath72 as the price , while multiple output functions will require multiple prices @xmath73 .",
    "the profit function in our case , which is a single - output multiple - inputs case , is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the weights chosen according to the importance for habitability for each planet .",
    "maximization of cd - hpf is achieved when @xmath76 the habitability score is conceptualized as a profit function where the cost component is introduced as a penalty function to check unbridled growth of cd - hpf .",
    "this bounding framework is elaborated in the proofs of concavity , the global maxima and computational optimization technique , and function _ fmincon _ in appendices b , c and d , respectively . + * remark * : if we consider the case of crs , where all the elasticities of different cost components are equal , the output is @xmath77 , where all @xmath78 are equal and @xmath79 . in such scenario ,",

    "further scrutiny reveals that the geometric mean formalization is nothing but the representation of the phi , thus establishing our framework of cd - hpf as a broader model , with the phi being a corollary for the crs case .",
    "once we compute the habitability score , @xmath34 , the next step is to perform clustering of the y values .",

    "the algorithm finds the exoplanets for which @xmath34 values are very close to each other and keeps them in the same group , or cluster .",
    "each cdhs value is compared with its @xmath81 ( specified by the user ) nearest exoplanet s ( closer @xmath34 values ) cdhs value , and the class which contains maximum nearest to the new one is allotted as a class for it .",

    "the `` earth - league '' , class @xmath102 , is the class where the algorithm `` dumps '' those exoplanets which satisfy the conditions of k - nn and threshold and probabilistic herding as explained in sections  @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we applied this algorithm again to the normalized cdhs of @xmath101 exoplanets under the same conditions .",
    "it is observed that the output was @xmath106 exoplanets that satisfied the conditions of being in class 6 , the `` earth - league '' , irrespective of crs or drs conditions .",
    "the reason is that the normalized scores are tighter and much closer to each other compared to the non - normalized cdhs , and that yielded a few more exoplanets in class @xmath102 .",
    "* esi is a number that tells us whether an exoplanet is similar to earth .",
    "it is common wisdom not to consider esi as the only metric for habitability ( * rita , please explain the physical reasons behind * ) .",
    "another metric , phi ca nt be used as a single benchmark for habitability and a lot of other physical conditions have to be checked before a conclusion may be drawn .",
    "* the proposed scoring method outperforms both esi and phi in terms of accurately classifying exoplanets as habitable or not .",
    "the novel method of computing habitability by cd - hpf and cdhs , coupled with k - nn with probabilistic herding makes it feasible to use a single metric that assigns majority of the habitable exoplanets , in earth s league .",
    "the existing k - nn algorithm has been modified and attribute enhanced voting scheme and probabilistic proximity have been utilized as a checkpoint for final class distributions  we call it as the `` earth - league '' . for large enough data samples ,",
    "there are theoretical guarantees that the algorithm will converge to a finite number of discriminating classes .",
    "the members of `` earth - league '' are cross - validated with the list of potentially habitable exoplanets in the hec database .",
    "the results ( table  9 ) render the proposed metric * cdhs * to behave with a reasonable degree of reliability .",
    "the two existing indices , esi and phi , are unreliable and sometimes controversial metrics as far as habitability of a planet is concerned . as observed , these values are not benchmarks for determination of habitability . at any rate ,",
    "a benchmark of habitability may sound a bit ambitious given the perpetual complexity of the problem .",
    "this is the reason that other physical parameters such as planets being terrestrial or not , conditions to support existence of liquid water , have to be considered .",
    "this is where the cd - hpf model triumphs .",
    "the model generates 12 potentially habitable exoplanets in class 6 , which is considered to be a class where earth - like planets reside .",
    "all these 12 exoplanets are identified as habitable by the phl .",
    "the score generated by our model is a single metric which could be used to classify habitability of exoplanets as members of the `` earth league '' , unlike esi and phi .",
    "attribute enhanced k - nn algorithm , implemented in the paper , helps achieve this goal and membership of exoplanets to different classes of habitability may change as the four input parameters of cobb - douglas model change values .",
    "cd - hpf is a novel metric of defining habitability score for exoplanets .",
    "it needs to be noted that the authors perceive habitability as a probabilistic measure , or a measure with varying degrees of certainty .",
    "therefore , the construction of different classes of habitability 1 to 6 is contemplated , corresponding to measures as  most likely to be habitable \" as class 6 , to  least likely to be habitable `` as class 1 . as a further illustration ,",
    "classes 6 and 5 seem to represent the identical patterns in habitability , but they do not !",
    "class 6  the ' ' earth - league \" , is different from class 5 in the sense that it satisfies the additional conditions of thresholding and probabilistic herding and , therefore , ranks higher on the habitability score .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the binary definition of exoplanets being  habitable or non - habitable `` , and a deterministic perception of the problem itself .",
    "the approach therefore required classification methods that are part of machine learning techniques and convex optimization  a sub - domain , strongly coupled with machine learning .",
    "cobb - douglas function and cdhs are used to determine habitability and the maximum habitability score of all exoplanets with confirmed surface temperatures in the phl - ec .",
    "global maxima is calculated theoretically and algorithmically for each exoplanet , exploiting intrinsic concavity of cd - hpf and ensuring ' ' no curvature violation `` .",
    "computed scores are fed to the attribute enhanced k - nn algorithm  a novel classification method , used to classify the planets into different classes to determine how similar an exoplanet is to earth .",
    "the authors would like to emphasize that , by using classical k - nn algorithm and not exploiting the probability of habitability criteria , the results obtained were pretty good , having 12 confirmed potentially habitable exoplanets in the ' ' earth - league \" .",
    "a catalog was created by the authors which lists the confirmed exoplanets with the class assignments and computed habitability scores .",
    "this catalog is built with the intention of further use in designing statistical experiments for the analysis of the correlation between habitability and the abundance of elements ( this work is briefly outlined in safonova et al . , 2016 ) .",
    "the full customized catalog of all confirmed exoplanets with class annotations is available at https://habitabilitypes.wordpress.com/. it is a very important observation that our algorithm and methods give rise a score structure , cdhs , which is structurally similar to phi as a corollary in the crs case ( when the elasticities in crs are assumed to be equal to each other ) .",
    "both are geometric means of the input parameters considered for the respective models .",
    "cd - hpf uses four parameters ( radius , density , escape velocity and surface temperature ) to compute habitability score , which alone are not sufficient to determine habitability of exoplanets .",
    "other parameters , such as e.g. orbital period , stellar flux , distance of the planet from host star , etc . may be equally important to determine the habitability .",
    "since our model is scalable , additional parameters can be added to achieve better and granular habitability score .",
    "in addition , out of @xmath107 confirmed exoplanets in hec , only 664 planets have their surface temperatures listed . for many expolanets , the surface temperature , which is an important parameter in this problem ,",
    "is not known or not defined .",
    "the unknown surface temperatures can be estimated using various statistical models .",
    "future work may include incorporating more input parameters , such as orbital velocity , orbital eccentricity , etc . to the cobb - douglas function , coupled with tweaking the attribute enhanced k - nn algorithm by checking an additional condition such as , e.g. distance to the host star .",
    "cobb - douglas , as proved , is a scalable model and does nt violate curvature with additional predictor variables .",
    "however , it is pertinent to check for the dominant parameters that contribute more towards the habitability score",
    ". this can be accomplished by computing percentage contributions to the response variable  the habitability score .",
    "we would like to conclude by stressing on the efficacy of the method of using a few of the parameters rather than sweeping through a host of properties listed in the catalogs , effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem . to sum up",
