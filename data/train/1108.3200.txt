    "entanglement represents the manifestation of correlations without a classical counterpart and it is regarded as the necessary ingredient at the basis of the power of quantum information processing . indeed quantum information applications as teleportation , quantum cryptography or quantum computers rely on entanglement as a crucial resource  @xcite . within the current state - of - art ,",
    "promising candidates for truly scalable quantum information processors are considered architectures that interface hardware components playing different roles like for example solid - state systems as stationary qubits combined in hybrid architectures with optical devices  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the stationary qubits are a collection of engineered qubits with desired properties , as decoupled as possible from one another to prevent errors . however , this architecture is somehow unfavorable to the creation and the conservation of entanglement .",
    "indeed , it would be desirable to have a hardware where `` naturally '' entanglement is present and that can be prepared in a highly entangled state that persists without any external control : the closest quantum entanglement analogue of a classical information memory support , i.e. an _ entanglement - storage unit _ ( esu ) .",
    "such hardware once prepared can be used at later times ( alone or with duplicates )  once the desired kind of entanglement has been distilled  to perform quantum information protocols  @xcite .",
    "the biggest challenge in the development of an esu is entanglement frailty : it is strongly affected by the detrimental presence of decoherence  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the search for a proper system to build an esu is undermined by the increasing complexity of quantum systems with a growing number of components , which makes entanglement more frail , more difficult to characterize , to create and to control  @xcite .",
    "moreover , given a many body quantum system , the search for a state with the desired properties is an exponentially hard task in the system size .",
    "nevertheless , in many - body quantum systems entanglement naturally arises : for example when undergoing a quantum phase transition  in proximity of a critical point the amount of entanglement possessed by the ground state scales with the size  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the closure of the energy gap at the critical point , the ground state is an extremely frail state : even very little perturbations might destroy it , inducing excitations towards other states .",
    "however a different strategy might be successful , corroborated also by very recent investigations on the entanglement properties of the eigenstates of many - body hamiltonians , where it has been shown that in some cases they are characterized by entanglement growing with the system size  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that by means of a recently developed optimal control technique  @xcite it is possible to identify and prepare a many body quantum system in robust , long - lived entangled states ( esu states ) .",
    "more importantly , we drive the system towards esu states without the need of any apriori information on the system , either about the eigenstates or about the energy spectrum .",
    "indeed , we do not first solve the complete spectrum and eigenstates , which is an exponentially difficult problem in the system size . recently ,",
    "optimal control has been used to drive quantum systems in entangled states or to improve the generation of entanglement  @xcite . however , here we have in mind a different scenario : to exploit the control to steer a system into a highly entangled state that is stable and robust even after switching off the control ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) .",
    "moreover we want to outline the fact that we do not choose the goal state , but only its properties . in the following",
    "we show that esu states are gap - protected entangled eigenstates of the system hamiltonian _ in the absence _ of the control , and that for an experimentally relevant model is indeed possible to identify and drive the system into the esu states .",
    "we show that the esu states , although not being characterized by the maximal entanglement sustainable by the system , are characterized by entanglement that grows with the system size .",
    "once a good esu state has been detected , due to its robustness it can be stored , characterized , and thus used for later quantum information processing .",
    "+ here we provide an important example of this approach , based on the the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model  @xcite , a system realizable in different experimental setups  @xcite ; we prepare an esu maximizing the von neumann entropy of a bipartition of the system and we model the action of the surrounding environment with noise terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , our protocol is compatible with different entanglement measures and different models , like the concurrence between the extremal spins in an ising chain , see sec .",
    "[ ising : sec ] .",
    "notice that with a straightforward generalization it can be adapted to a full description of open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ protocol : sec ] the general protocol to steer a system onto esu state is presented ; in sec .",
    "[ model : sec ] we consider the application of the protocol to the lipkin - meshkov - glick model ; in sec .",
    "[ noise : sec ] we discuss the effect of a telegraphic classical noise onto the protocol ; in sec .",
    "[ ising : sec ] we test the protocol into an ising spin chain , and finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusion : sec ] we present the conclusions of our work .",
    "as depicted in fig .  [ scheme ] , we consider the general scenario of a system represented by a tunable hamiltonian @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the control field , and initialized in a state @xmath2 that can be easily prepared .",
    "we assume that the control field @xmath1 can be modulated only in the finite time interval @xmath3 $ ] ; outside of this interval , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we impose @xmath6 ( e.g. absence of control ) . according to our protocol , at the end of the control procedure ,",
    "i.e. once the control field is brought back to the value @xmath7 , the system has been prepared in a state with desired properties ( for instance high entanglement ) , stable in absence of the control and robust against noise and perturbations . +",
    "optimal control has been already used to enhance a given desired property without targeting an apriori known state ; unfortunately the results of such optimization are usually fragile and ideally require a continuous application of the control in order to be stabilized  @xcite .",
    "however in practical situations a continuous application of control can be unrealistic , being either simply impossible or too expensive in terms of resources .",
    "an example is the initialization of a quantum register that has to be physically moved into different spatial locations ( like a portable memory support ) , or if the control field used to initialize has to be switched on and off in order to manipulate different parts of the apparatus ; in such situations indeed the register should be stable also once disconnected from the device employed for its initialization .",
    "consequently in certain applications , a procedure capable to prepare quantum targets intrinsically stable even in the absence of sustained external manipulations is not only highly desirable but also crucial .",
    "the main contribution of our work is exactly to move a step forward in this direction , proposing a flexible recipe to improve the stability of the outcome of a generic optimization process .",
    "+ the simply idea behind our method is the following : as it is well known , in a closed system , the evolution of an arbitrary state is driven by schrdinger equation @xmath8 . assuming that , as in the absence of control , the hamiltonian is constant @xmath9 $ ] , we can evaluate the extent of the deviation induced by the time evolution in an infinitesimal time @xmath10 after switching off the control  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12|\\psi ( t)\\rangle -\\tilde{e } ^2}$ ] and @xmath13|\\psi ( t)\\rangle$ ] correspond respectively to the energy fluctuations and the energy of the hamiltonian in absence of control . then from eq .",
    "( [ psi_ev : eq ] ) it is clear that an arbitrary state is stabilized by minimizing the quantity @xmath14 . in particular , by reaching the condition @xmath15 , the system is also prepared in an eigenstate of @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "+ our protocol relies on the use of optimal control implemented through the chopped random basis ( crab ) technique@xcite .",
    "the crab method consists in expanding the control field onto a truncated basis ( e.g. a truncated fourier series ) and in minimizing an appropriate cost function with respect to the weights of each component of the chopped basis ( see  @xcite for details of the method ) .",
    "+ in particular , for the esu protocol a crab optimization is performed with the goal of minimizing the cost function @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents a measure of entanglement , @xmath20 is a lagrange multiplier , and the cost function is evaluated on the optimized evolved state @xmath21 produced with a control process active in the time interval @xmath3 $ ] . as discussed previously and shown in the following , the inclusion in @xmath17 of the constraint on the energy fluctuations is the crucial ingredient to stabilize the result of the optimization also for times @xmath22 , that is once the control has been switched off .",
    "+ we conclude this section stressing a couple of important advantages of our protocol with respect to possible other approaches to the problem , like for instance evaluating all the eigenstates of the system and picking up among them the state(s ) with the desired properties .",
    "first , in our protocol we never compute the whole spectrum of the system , but we simply require to evaluate the energy and the energy fluctuations into the evolved state , see eq .",
    "( [ cost_f : eq ] ) ; therefore our procedure can be applied also to situations in which it is not possible to compute all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( e.g. many - body non integrable systems or dmrg simulations or experiments including a feedback loop ) .",
    "furthermore it can occur that none of the eigenstates of the system owns the desired property we would like to enhance ; then by simply considering the eigenstates one could not gain any advantage . on the contrary ,",
    "also in this situation , with our protocol it is possible to identify states that , even though different from exact eigenstates , anyway show an enhanced robustness , like the optimal state found in the considered scenario , see sec .",
    "[ ising : sec ] .",
    "we decided to apply the protocol to the lipkin - meshkov - glick model@xcite because it represents an interesting prototype of the challenge we address : it describes different experimental setups  @xcite , and the entanglement properties of the eigenstates are in general not known .",
    "indeed , the entanglement properties of the eigenstates of one - dimensional many - body quantum systems have been related with the corresponding conformal field theories  @xcite ; however for the lmg model , to our knowledge , this study has never been performed and a conformal theory is not available  @xcite . finally , the optimal control problem we address is highly non - trivial as the control field is global and space - independent with no single - site addressability  @xcite .",
    "the lmg hamiltonian describes an ensemble of spins with infinite - range interaction and is written as@xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total number of spins , @xmath25 s ( @xmath26 ) are the pauli matrices on the @xmath27th site and @xmath28 is a constant measuring the intensity of the spin - spin interaction . by introducing the total spin operator @xmath29 , the hamiltonian can be rewritten , apart from an additive constant and a constant factor as @xmath30    ( from now on we set @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the symmetries of the hamiltonian imply that the dynamics is restricted to subspaces of fixed total magnetization @xmath33 and fixed parity of the projection @xmath34 ; a convenient basis for such subspaces is represented by the dicke states @xmath35 with @xmath36  @xcite . in the thermodynamical limit the system undergoes a 2nd order qpt from a quantum paramagnet to a quantum ferromagnet at a critical value of the transverse field @xmath37 .",
    "there is no restriction to the reference value @xmath7 and to the initial state @xmath38 : we choose @xmath39 , corresponding to the paramagnetic phase and as initial state @xmath2 , the ground state of @xmath16 $ ] , i.e. the separable state in which all the spins are polarized along the positive @xmath40-axis  @xcite . a convenient measure of the entanglement in the lmg model is given by the von neumann entropy @xmath41 associated to the reduced density matrix @xmath42 of a block of @xmath43 spins out of the total number @xmath24 , which gives a measure of the entanglement present between two partitions of a quantum system  @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we consider two equal partitions , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "note that the maximally entangled state at a fixed size @xmath24 is given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ lmg_central_eig_ent_vs_size_1:fig ] we report the entanglement @xmath47 of the eigenstates deeply inside the paramagnetic phase at @xmath48 , for systems of different sizes .",
    "clearly , also far from the critical point @xmath49 many eigenstates possess a remarkable amount of entanglement that scales with the system size .",
    "the effect is shown more clearly in fig .",
    "[ lmg_central_eig_ent_vs_size_2:fig ] , where the entanglement of the central eigenstate ( red full circles ) at @xmath50 is compared with the entanglement of the ground state at the critical point ( full blue diamonds ) .",
    "both sets of data show a logarithmic scaling with the size , but the entanglement of the central eigenstate is systematically higher and grows more rapidly .    _",
    "dynamics._ we initialize the system in the non - entangled ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath51 so that in the absence of control , i.e. for @xmath52 independent of time , the state @xmath38 does not evolve apart from a phase factor . after the action of the crab - optimized driving field @xmath1 for @xmath53 $ ] the state is prepared in @xmath54 ( a typical optimal pulse is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ent_inf_vs_timewl64_2:fig ] ) , and we observe the evolution of the state over times @xmath22 . the behavior of the entanglement is shown in fig .",

    "on the contrary , if the energy fluctuations are included in the cost function ( @xmath58 ) , the optimal driving field steers the system into entangled eigenstates of @xmath16 $ ] , as confirmed by the absence of the oscillations in the entanglement and by the entanglement eigenstate reference values ( empty blue circles ) .",
    "these results are confirmed by the survival probability in the initial state @xmath59 reported in fig .",
    "[ ent_inf_vs_timewl64_2:fig ] : the state prepared with @xmath56 decays over very fast time scales @xmath60 , while for @xmath58 it remains close to the unity for very long times @xmath61 .",
    "the small residual oscillations for @xmath55 and @xmath62 are due to the fact that in this case the optimization leads to a state corresponding to an eigenstate up to @xmath63 .",
    "we repeated the optimal preparation for different system sizes and initial states , and show the entanglement of the optimized states for @xmath56 ( empty green triangles ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 empty red circles ) for different system sizes in fig .",

    "a logarithmic scaling with the size is achieved .",
    "a reliable esu should be robust against external noise and decoherence even when the control is switched off , in such a way that it could be used for subsequent quantum operations . in order to test the robustness of the optimized states , we model the effect of decoherence by adding a random telegraph noise and we monitor the time evolution in such noisy environment  @xcite . in particular we study the evolution induced by the hamiltonian @xmath67j_x^2-\\tilde{\\gamma } [ 1+i_{\\beta}\\beta ( t ) ]   j_z \\label{ham_noise : eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 are random functions of the time with a flat distribution in @xmath69 $ ] ( @xmath70 ) , changing random value every typical time @xmath71 .",
    "the case @xmath72 corresponds to a noiseless evolution .",
    "the first important observation is that the frequency @xmath73 of the signal fluctuations is crucial in determining its effects  @xcite . indeed in fig .",

[ ent_inf_vs_timewl64_1:fig ] ) .",
    "when @xmath73 is either too low ( empty circles ) or too high ( full diamonds ) the effect of the noise is reduced ; however around a resonant frequency @xmath77 ( dashed line with crosses ) its effect is enhanced and the state is quickly destroyed .",
    "we checked that the resonant frequency is the same for different eigenvalues , different sizes , and different noise strengths ( data not shown ) , reflecting the fact that in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath78 ) the gap separating the eigenstates is proportional to @xmath7 independently of the size of the system and of the state itself , see eq .",
    "( [ ham_lmg : eq ] ) . therefore we analyze this worst case scenario , setting @xmath79 from now on . in fig .",
    "[ comparison_inf_vs_timenl64r0r1.8_2:fig ]    we compare the survival probability @xmath74 for three instances of the disorder at the resonant frequency with an intensity of the disorder @xmath80 .",

    "[ lifetime_vs_i_fig ] we study the decay times of the survival probability @xmath74 studying the time @xmath82 needed to drop below a given threshold @xmath83 as a function of the system size @xmath24 and of the intensity of the disorder @xmath84 ( inset ) .",
    "these results clearly show that @xmath82 for esu states is almost independent from the system size , reflecting the fact that the energy gaps in this region of the spectrum are mostly size independent .",
    "notice that , on the contrary , @xmath82 for maximally entangled states decays linearly with the system size and that there are more than four orders of magnitude of difference in the decay times @xmath85 and @xmath60 . finally , the inset of fig .",
    "[ lifetime_vs_i_fig ] shows that the scaling of @xmath82 with the noise strength for esu states is approximately a power law and again depends very weakly on the system size @xmath24 .",
    "in our previous discussion we focused our attention onto the optimization of the von neumann entropy of eigenstates other than the ground state of the lmg model , in order to show the effectiveness of our protocol in controlling the dynamics and unexplored properties of many - body systems .",
    "however aiming at demonstrating the generality of the method , in this section we would like to present briefly the application of our protocol to a different situation , closer to the typical problems encountered in quantum information : in particular we are showing how it is possible to stabilize the concurrence between the extremal spins of an open ising chain . + the hamiltonian of the ordered one - dimensional ising model with nearest neighbor interaction is given by : @xmath86 where the transverse field @xmath87 is our control field .",
    "we assume that the system can be easily prepared in the ground state at a large value of the control field @xmath50 , in which all the spins are polarized along the positive @xmath40-direction .",

    "the concurrence between two spins is defined as @xmath88 , where the @xmath89 s are the eigenvalues in decreasing order of the hermitian matrix @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the reduced density matrix of the two extremal spins , and @xmath92 is the spin - flipped state  @xcite .",
    "+ at a large value of the transverse field , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are the classical states represented by all the possible up - down combinations of @xmath24 spins , and states with the same numbers of flipped spins , though in different positions , are degenerate . a naive approach to build stable entangled states",
    "would then require a search for possibly entangled states in each degenerate subspace at a given energy .",
    "such a search however represents a highly non trivial task , due to the strong constraint imposed by requiring non vanishing concurrence : again a suitable recipe for such a search should be provided and is non - trivial to find . on the contrary our protocol proposes an answer to the task without requiring any diagonalization , while automatically performing the search , therefore offering a clear advantage . + we perform a crab optimization in the time interval @xmath3 $ ] minimizing the function @xmath93 , in which now @xmath19 is the concurrence ; then at the time @xmath94 the control is switched off , the value of the field is kept constant ( @xmath95 for @xmath22 ) , and we observe the evolution of the optimized state . in fig .  [ ising_n10_fig ] we show the behavior of the concurrence @xmath57 and of the survival probability @xmath96 , excluding ( @xmath56 black continuous line ) and including ( @xmath97 red dot - dashed line ) the energy fluctuation term in the optimization procedure . as shown in the picture , although , as expected , the concurrence is smaller when @xmath58 , the survival probability is stabilized by a factor bigger than @xmath98 in time with respect to the @xmath56 case .",
    "exploiting optimal control we proposed a method to steer a system into apriori unknown eigenstates satisfying desired properties .",
    "we demonstrated , on a particular system , that this protocol can be effectively used to build long - lived entangled states with many - body systems , indicating a possible implementations of an entanglement storage unit scalable with the system size .",
    "the presented method is compatible with different models ( e.g. lmg and ising ) and measures of entanglement ( e.g. von neumann entropy and concurrence ) and it can be extended to any other property one is interested in , as for example the squeezing of the target state  @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to different systems with apriori unknown properties : optimal control will select the states ( if any ) satisfying the desired property and robust to system perturbations . we stress that an adiabatic strategy is absolutely ineffective for this purpose , as transitions between different eigenstates are forbidden . applying this protocol to the full open - dynamics description of the system , e.g. via a crab optimization of the lindblad dynamics as done in  @xcite ,",
    "will result in an optimal search of a decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) with desired properties  @xcite .",
    "if no dfs exists , the optimization would lead the system in an eigenstate of the superoperator with longest lifetime and desired properties  @xcite .",
    "although the state so prepared may be unstable over long times , it represents the best and most robust state attainable , and additional ( weak ) control might be used to preserve its stability . finally , working with excited states",
    "would reduce finite temperature effects , relaxing low temperatures working - point conditions , simplifying the experimental requirements to build a reliable esu .",
