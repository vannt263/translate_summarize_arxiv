    "an important recent development that has spurted a new direction for the physics of bose - einstein condensation has been the observation of condensation phenomena for polaritons in semiconductor microcavities @xcite at much higher temperatures than ultracold atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . in the setting of exciton - polariton becs , the condensing `` entities '' are excitons , i.e. , bound electron - hole particles .",
    "when confined , these develop strong coupling with light , forming exciton - photon mixed quasi - particles known as polaritons @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature formation of polariton condensates leads the quasi - particles to also possess a finite lifetime : in fact , they can only exist for a few picoseconds in the cavity before they decay into photons .",
    "hence , thermal equilibrium can never be achieved and the system produces a genuinely far - from - equilibrium condensate , in which external pumping from a reservoir of excitons counter balances the loss of polaritons due to the above decay mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , numerous key features of the superfluid character of the exciton - polariton condensates have been established , including the flow without scattering ( analog of the flow without friction ) @xcite , the existence of vortices @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for vortex dipole dynamics ) , the collective dynamics @xcite , as well as remarkable applications such as spin switches @xcite and light emitting diodes @xcite operating even near room temperatures .",
    "the pumping and damping mechanisms associated with polaritons enable the formulation of different types of models .",
    "one of these , proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite suggests the use of a single partial differential equation ( pde ) for the polariton condensate incorporating the above mentioned loss - gain mechanisms .",
    "this model features a localized ( within a pumping region ) gain and a nonlinear saturating loss of polaritons ; these are the fundamental differences of this setting from the standard pde mean - field model , namely the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) used in the physics of atomic becs @xcite . in another class of models , which has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the polaritons are coupled to the evolution of the exciton population ; such models also display nonlinear diffusive spatial dynamics for the excitons .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to consider the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) dynamics of polariton becs and to illustrate their _ fundamental differences _ from the more standard alkali - atom condensates . at this point",
    "we should mention that polariton condensates considered so far ( also experimentally ) have been intrinsically two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , using tight confinement along one , transversal , direction ( i.e. , highly anisotropic variants of the traditional parabolic traps ) we envision rendering the polariton condensate effectively 1d @xcite .",
    "in addition , a broader perspective for our considerations is that understanding the nonlinear dynamics and pertinent phenomenology in the 1d setting , may pave the way towards subsequently generalizing relevant considerations to the more realistic 2d case .",
    "the key phenomena that are reported herein are : a wide parametric interval of destabilization of the fundamental nodeless state of polariton becs ; a partial stability within this interval of excited states , in the form of dark solitons ; the spontaneous production of higher excited ( multi - soliton ) states from lower ones or even from nodeless states ; the production of dark soliton trains by dragging of a defect through the polariton bec ( cf .  the recent relevant 2d experimental results in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; and finally the formation of long - lived dark multi - soliton dynamical states through the interference of two separated polaritonic condensates in analogy with the atomic bec case of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our model and setup , providing also a brief description of our methods .",
    "section iii is devoted to our detailed numerical investigations , and section iv concludes our work , including some suggestions for possible future studies .",
    "in our analysis below , we consider the modified complex gross - pitaevskii model developed in refs .",

    "the differences of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyn ] ) from the standard gpe appearing in the physics of atomic becs can be traced to the presence of ( i ) the spatially dependent gain term with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the step function generating a symmetric spot of `` radius '' @xmath6 and strength @xmath7 for the gain and ( ii ) the nonlinear saturation loss term of strength @xmath8 .",
    "estimates of the relevant physical time and space scales , as well as physically relevant parameter values , are given in ref .",
    "we should also note in passing that although our results below are given in the context of eq .",

    "in addition , in what follows , we have considered dynamical scenarios under which nonlinear excitations , such as single- or multiple - dark - solitons @xcite can arise in the context of polariton becs .",
    "such excited states have been extensively studied in the context of atomic becs @xcite , while they have been amply considered in recent experimental investigations in this context @xcite .",
    "additionally , motivated by relevant studies in atomic becs @xcite and recent experiments in polariton condensates @xcite , we consider the nucleation of dark solitons by a moving defect , modeled by a ( localized ) potential ; the latter , is assumed to be produced by a narrow laser beam of gaussian shape , namely : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the amplitude , speed , and width of the potential , respectively .",
    "we consider the fixed point solution of the modified gpe ( [ eq : dyn ] ) in the presence of this second defect potential ( in addition to the harmonic trap @xmath2 ) at the center of the trap .",
    "then we evolve the system in time starting from this solution , dragging the defect through the system .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the recent experiments of ref .",

    "we hereby explore the existence , stability and dynamical properties of the nodeless cloud ( nc ) as well as of excited states exhibiting a single - node , namely dark solitons ( dss ) .",
    "the above mentioned states ( nc and ds ) are the most fundamental nonlinear states of the system , whose profiles for different parameter combinations are displayed in fig .",

    "[ fig : profiles1 ] depicts the nc and ds profiles for a constant saturation coefficient @xmath26 and constant pumping spot strength @xmath24 , and a varying radius of the pumping spot @xmath6 .",
    "we observe that , for given values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , there is a critical value of @xmath6 above which the shapes of the ncs and dss remain unchanged . in the example depicted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles1 ] , the profiles for @xmath38 are indistinguishable from each other ( see profiles for @xmath25 and @xmath28 ) . this effect is due to the fact that for large @xmath6 , the pumping spot covers a larger portion than the saturated size of the cloud when loss and gain are balanced .",
    "this cloud size is the analogue of the thomas - fermi radius for an atomic condensate .",
    "the saturation of the cloud size is equivalent to the saturation of the chemical potential @xmath10 as @xmath6 is increased , as shown below ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : dyn1 ] and [ fig : dyn2 ] ) . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles1 ] we depict the nc and ds profiles for a constant pumping spot radius @xmath25 and a varying pumping spot strength .",
    "note that , in this case , the size of the cloud continuously expands ( in amplitude and width ) with increasing spot strength .",
    "we now proceed to provide a characterization of the existence and stability properties of the nc and ds profiles with respect to the various parameters at hand . in what follows , in order to offer a picture of the relevant parameter space , we have varied the gain parameters @xmath7 and @xmath6 whereas the coefficient of the saturating nonlinear loss @xmath37 has been kept fixed .",

    "( [ eq : stat ] ) .",
    "the nc and ds configurations exist for all parameter combinations , as it is the case for atomic condensates .",
    "nevertheless , as far as the stability and dynamical properties of nc and ds states are concerned , we can observe _ fundamental _ differences between the pumped - damped polariton becs and atomic becs .",
    "in particular , the nodeless cloud ( which was _ always _ stable in the hamiltonian case of atomic becs @xcite ) _ is now stable only below a critical value of the pumping spot size _ @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "also remarkably , even the single ds is stable only in a limited range , while it was _ always _ stable in quasi-1d harmonically trapped atomic becs ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , in a very unusual manifestation of stability inversions , not only can the nodeless state be stable while the dark soliton is not , but also vice versa : the state with a node can be stable while the one without a node is not . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] we show the details of the bogolyubov spectra of both states . these showcase the dissipative nature of the dynamics",
    "being associated with frequencies chiefly with negative imaginary part ; moreover , they also illustrate the potential instabilities arising in the system through hopf bifurcations and oscillatory instabilities associated with complex eigenfrequencies , or through zero crossings ( and purely imaginary eigenfrequencies ) .",
    "this second scenario only appears for dark solitons . from an intuitive viewpoint",
    ", this phenomenology can partially be understood on the following grounds .",
    "the condensate in the absence of the external driving has an intrinsic length scale selected by the trap ( and the chemical potential ) .",
    "the presence of the external forcing over the radius @xmath6 introduces an additional length scale competing with the former one .",
    "hence , when this forcing becomes fairly ( spatially ) extended , it favors a spatially wider state .",
    "this is manifested through the instability of a group of `` background '' spectral modes ( which are not the lowest modes of the condensate close to the spectral plane origin ) in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] . on the contrary",
    ", the dark soliton or multi - soliton states may become unstable through the same mechanism , or they may also become unstable through their `` internal modes '' @xcite which lead to the isolated instability through the zero crossing .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn1 ] we show a continuation of the nodeless state , for a fixed value of @xmath36 .",

    "the values shown are in the unstable domain of the nc .",
    "there are two types of behavior .",
    "the first behavior , for @xmath40 , corresponds to the nc decaying into multiple - dark - solitons , by means of oscillatory transients ( even in the region of stability of the single ds ) .",

    "we have checked that this breathing behavior persists for very long times ( larger than several thousands ) without any apparent decay .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for these parameter values , the steady state sawtooth configuration is unstable ( see the spectrum depicted in the inset of the top panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : dynfinger ] ) and thus the cloud can not decay to this state . for other parameter values ,",

    "one possible nucleating mechanism for dark solitons is by _ dragging an obstacle _ in the form of the potential of eq .",

    "[ fig : def1 ] , although three ( or even four ) ds can be seen being emitted out of the defect path , through collisions they eventually decay down to two , that continue to interact .",
    "the ds nature of these structures can be seen through the phase jump of @xmath62 shown ( together with its profile ) in the inset .",
    "chains of dark solitons ( alias `` dark soliton trains '' ) can be produced by this dragging defect mechanism if one chooses a weaker harmonic trap @xmath63 [ instead of @xmath2 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyn ] ) ] , with a trap strength @xmath64 sufficiently small . if fact , as depicted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : def1 ] , a weaker trapping with @xmath50 ( corresponding to a considerably wider condensate ) allows for the formation of a train of dss that propagates initially in the opposite direction of the dragging defect .",
    "however , contrary to the hamiltonian case of atomic becs where the distance between the generated dss appears to be approximately constant @xcite , here dss interact strongly with each other and with the background cloud , setting it in oscillation .",
    "this might also be due to the unstable nature of the underlying nc cloud for this parameter set .",
    "again the ds nature is visible from the @xmath62 phase jump at each of the nonlinear excitations shown in the inset .",
    "another possible nucleation mechanism for dss is by nonlinear interference ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion in the context of atomic becs ) .",
    "this mechanism can be realized by splitting the condensate into two fragments by adiabatically inducing a potential barrier in the central portion of a stationary nodeless cloud , and subsequently releasing the fragments by suddenly removing the barrier that separates them .",
    "this `` nonlinear interference method '' was used in atomic bec experiments to demonstrate the generation of vortex structures @xcite ( see also theoretical work in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and dark solitons @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dw1 ] depicts two samples of this nucleation mechanism where two polariton condensates , initially placed in a double well potential , are released in the harmonic trap and allowed to interfere .",
    "again we show the scenarios of strong ( top ) and weak(er ) harmonic confinement ( bottom ) .",
    "we considered an initial situation where a barrier of the same shape as ( but wider than ) the obstacle considered before [ cf .",
    "eq .  [ obs ] ) ] is superposed at the center of the harmonic trap . at @xmath65",
    "the barrier is removed , thus allowing the two portions of the condensate to mix and interfere . as can be seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dw1 ] , a pair of dark pulses is formed ; but contrary to the case of the soliton trains nucleated by the dragging defect , we observe that the dss nucleated by the nonlinear interference mechanism move relatively fast away from each other towards the edge of the condensate .",
    "notice that , as again shown in the inset , the phase jumps of approximately @xmath62 indicate that these are pairs of genuine dss .",
    "the bottom panel shows the case of weaker confinement where in this case more than one pair of nonlinear excitations is produced by the nonlinear interference .",
    "in this work , we considered and studied a complex gross - pitaevskii model describing the quasi - one - dimensional dynamics of polariton condensates .",
    "our motivation was to understand the fundamental differences between polariton condensates and their atomic ( hamiltonian becs ) counterparts .",
    "we found that the specific pumping and damping terms that have been argued as being relevant to polariton condensates case offer a wide range of unexpected features when compared to atomic condensates .",
    "the fundamental nodeless state ( regarded as the `` ground state '' ) of the system was found to become unstable through a variety of mechanisms , while excited states in the form of single- or multiple - dark solitons were found to result from the instability of the nodeless state .",
    "the fundamental excited state , namely the single dark soliton was also found to be subject to instabilities , leading to either spontaneous formation of multi - dark soliton states or even to emergence of a `` dark - soliton - turbulence '' ( when highly unstable ) .",
    "all these are dynamical manifestations which significantly distinguish the polaritonic case from the atomic bec variant of the problem , yet we have intuitively attributed them to the emerging competition of length scales ( among the intrinsic length scale of the trapped system and the length scale of the applied forcing ) .",
    "we also observed the emergence of _ stable asymmetric _ sawtooth - like configurations which are not present in atomic becs .    finally , other techniques , namely nucleation of dark solitons by dragging an obstacle through the condensate and through nonlinear interference of colliding condensate fragments , have been studied .",
    "these were adapted from the atomic condensate case in order to produce fundamental nonlinear excitations in the form of dark solitons .",
    "it was shown that both techniques were efficient in doing so .",
    "there are numerous interesting avenues that this work opens in the way of future directions . on the one hand",
    ", it would be useful to try to develop analytical tools to understand the instability of dark solitons in polariton condensates , as well as that of the backgrounds ( i.e. , the nodeless clouds ) on which these `` live '' .",
    "on the other hand , it would be interesting to extend some of the present considerations , such as the spectral analysis of stationary states , or the nonlinear interference technique for producing coherent structures in the 2d case to examine some of the theoretical and potentially even experimentally relevant ( in the latter case ) results thereof .",
    "such studies are currently in progress and will be reported in future publications .",

    "<S> it is also observed that for suitable parametric choices , the instability of single dark solitons can nucleate multi - dark - soliton states . </S>",
    "<S> also , for other parametric regions , _ stable asymmetric _ sawtooth - like solutions exist . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the dragging of a defect through the condensate and the interference of two initially separated condensates , both of which are capable of nucleating dark multi - soliton dynamical states . </S>"
