    "in 1977 jaffe predicted a deeply bound 6-quark state with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 from the bag - model , called the @xmath0-dibaryon @xcite . subsequently , many experimental searches for the @xmath0-dibaryon were carried out , but so far no convincing signal was found @xcite .",
    "however , recently evidence for a bound @xmath0-dibaryon was claimed based on lattice qcd calculations @xcite . extrapolations of the simulations , performed for pion masses @xmath7 mev , to the physical mass suggest that the @xmath0-dibaryon could be either loosely bound or move into the continuum @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze various issues related to these lattice results in the framework of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) for the baryon - baryon ( @xmath8 ) interaction at leading order ( lo ) in the weinberg counting .",
    "this scheme has proven successful for the few data on hyperon - nucleon scattering @xcite and also for the bounds that exist on the @xmath8 interactions with strangeness @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "there is one low - energy constant ( lec ) in the @xmath9 sector , corresponding to the su(3 ) flavor - singlet channel , that can not be fitted by hyperon - nucleon data and can be fine - tuned to produce a bound @xmath0 with a given binding energy .",
    "this framework also allows us to study the quark mass dependence of the binding energy of the @xmath0 , see the calculations of the quark mass dependence of the deuteron binding energy in @xcite .",
    "another important issue to be addressed here is how this quark mass dependence is affected when the su(3 ) breaking manifested in the masses of the octet baryons is accounted for . in the real world",
    "the @xmath8 thresholds are not degenerate but they all differ for the relevant @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 systems and that has very definite dynamical consequences , as we will show in what follows .",
    "the pertinent results of our study can be summarized as follows :    * we have analyzed the effective range expansion for the @xmath10 @xmath12 channel , assuming a loosely bound @xmath0 dibaryon .",
    "it shows a very different behaviour to the case of the deuteron in the neutron - proton @xmath13 channel .",
    "in fact , any attraction supplied by the flavor - singlet channel contributes with a much larger weight to the @xmath2 interaction than to @xmath10 , according to su(3 ) flavor symmetry , so that the @xmath0-dibaryon should predominantly be a @xmath2 bound state .",
    "* we observe that , for pion masses below 400  mev , the dependence of the binding energy of the @xmath0 is linearly decreasing with decreasing pion mass , in agreement with the findings in ref .",
    "in particular , a @xmath0 binding energy ( be ) adjusted to the value found by nplqcd @xcite at @xmath14mev , is reduced by 7  mev at the physical pion mass . for larger pion masses ,",
    "this dependence is weakened .",
    "note , however , that for such large pion masses this should only be considered a trend as the chiral eft is constructed for masses / momenta well below the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "* we find a much more drastic effect caused by the su(3 ) breaking related to the values of the three thresholds @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath2",
    ". for physical values the be of the @xmath0 is reduced by as much as 60  mev as compared to a calculation based on degenerate ( i.e. su(3 ) symmetric ) @xmath8 thresholds . translating this observation to the situation in the hal qcd @xcite calculation , we see that the bound state has disappeared at the physical point . for the case of the nplqcd calculation",
    ", a resonance in the @xmath10 system might survive .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we recall the basic formalism of the @xmath8 interaction in the framework of chiral eft .",
    "[ sec:3 ] contains a detailed discussion of the quark mass dependence of the be of the @xmath0 and the influence of the su(3 ) breaking through the various two - baryon thresholds . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we try to make direct contact to the results published by the nplqcd and hal qcd collaborations .",
    "for details on the derivation of the chiral @xmath8 potentials for the strangeness sector at lo using the weinberg power counting , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we just briefly summarize the pertinent ingredients of the chiral eft for @xmath8 interactions .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the lo @xmath15 invariant contact terms for the octet @xmath8 interactions that are hermitian and invariant under lorentz transformations follow from the lagrangians @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the dirac indices of the particles , @xmath19 is the irreducible octet ( matrix ) representation of @xmath15 , and the @xmath20 are the usual elements of the clifford algebra @xcite . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to lo the lagrangians in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) give rise to only six independent low - energy coefficients ( lecs ) , the @xmath21s in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) , due to @xmath15 constraints .",
    "they need to be determined by a fit to experimental data .",
    "it is convenient to re - express the @xmath8 potentials in terms of the @xmath22 irreducible representations , see e.g. refs .",
    "then the contact interaction is given by @xmath23 and the constraints imposed by the assumed @xmath15 symmetry on the interactions in the various @xmath8 channels for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 partial waves can be readily read off from table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the lowest order @xmath15 invariant pseudoscalar - meson  baryon interaction lagrangian embodying the appropriate symmetries was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the invariance under @xmath15 transformations implies specific relations between the various coupling constants , namely @xmath24 here @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nucleon axial - vector strength and @xmath27 is the weak pion decay constant .",
    "we use the values @xmath28 and @xmath29  mev . for @xmath30 , the @xmath31-ratio @xcite",
    ", we adopt the su(6 ) value : @xmath32 , which is consistent with recent determinations of the axial - vector coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the spin - space part of the lo one - pseudoscalar - meson - exchange potential is similar to the static one - pion - exchange potential in chiral eft for nucleon - nucleon interactions , see e.g. @xcite ( recoil and relativistic corrections give higher order contributions ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the exchanged pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the transferred and average momentum , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are defined in terms of the final and initial center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "momenta of the baryons , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the calculation we use the physical masses of the exchanged pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the explicit @xmath41 breaking reflected in the mass splitting between the pseudoscalar mesons and , in particular , the small mass of the pion relative to the other members of the octet leads to sizeable differences in the range of the interactions in the different channels and , thus , induces an essential dynamical breaking of @xmath41 symmetry in the @xmath8 interactions .",
    "the @xmath42 meson was identified with the octet @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and its physical mass was used .",
    "the reaction amplitudes are obtained from the solution of a coupled - channels lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the interaction potentials : @xmath44 the label @xmath45 indicates the particle channels and the label @xmath46 the partial wave .",
    "@xmath47 is the pertinent reduced mass .",
    "the on - shell momentum in the intermediate state , @xmath48 , is defined by @xmath49 .",
    "relativistic kinematics is used for relating the laboratory energy @xmath50 of the hyperons to the c.m . momentum .    in @xcite",
    "the ls equation was solved in the particle basis , in order to incorporate the correct physical thresholds .",
    "since here we are only interested in the @xmath0 dibaryon we work in the isospin basis . then for @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath9 we have to consider the three coupled channels @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we use the following ( isospin averaged ) masses @xmath51 mev , @xmath52 mev , @xmath53 mev , and @xmath54 mev so that the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 thresholds are at 2231.2 , 2257.7 , and 2385.0  mev , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the potentials in the ls equation are cut off with a regulator function , @xmath55 $ ] , in order to remove high - energy components of the baryon and pseudoscalar meson fields @xcite .",
    "we consider cut - off values in the range 550 , ... , 700 mev , similar to what was used for chiral @xmath56 potentials @xcite .",
    "the imposed @xmath41 flavor symmetry implies that only five of the six lecs contribute to the @xmath57 interaction , namely @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , cf .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "these five contact terms were determined in @xcite by a fit to the @xmath57 scattering data .",
    "since the @xmath56 data can not be described with a lo eft , @xmath41 constraints from the @xmath56 interaction were not implemented explicitly . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a good description of the 35 low - energy @xmath57 scattering can be obtained for cutoff values @xmath63 mev and for natural values of the lecs .",
    "the sixth lec ( @xmath64 ) is only present in the @xmath9 channels with isospin zero , cf .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "there is scarce experimental information on these channels that could be used to fix this lec , but it turned out that the quality of the existing data do not really allow to constrain its value reliably @xcite .",
    "even with the value of the sixth lec chosen so that @xmath65 , agreement with those data can be achieved . in this case",
    "a scattering length of @xmath66  fm @xcite is obtained .",
    "analyses of the measured binding energy of the double - strange hypernucleus @xmath67 @xcite suggest that the @xmath1 scattering length could be in the range of @xmath68 to @xmath69 fm @xcite .",
    "chiral effective field theory itself does not allow one to make any predictions with regard to the existence of the @xmath0 dibaryon because , as stated , one of the contact terms ( @xmath70 ) occurs just in the channel in question , cf .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] , and has to be determined from there . if we take over the values for @xmath58 and @xmath61 as fixed from the @xmath71 data and assume that @xmath72 then we find no bound state for @xmath10 - neither in lo @xcite nor based on the preliminary nlo results @xcite .",
    "however , if we assume that @xmath73 and vary its value then in both cases a near - threshold bound state can be produced for values of natural size .    at the same time",
    ", the framework of chiral effective field theory in which our @xmath10 interaction is derived is very well suited to shed light on the general characteristics of a @xmath0-dibaryon , should it indeed exist .",
    "in particular , it allows us study the implications of the imposed ( approximate ) su(3 ) flavor symmetry and to explore the dependence of the properties of an assumed @xmath0-dibaryon on the masses of the relevant mesons and baryons .",
    "the latter aspect is a rather crucial issue in view of the fact that the available lattice qcd calculations were not performed at the physical masses of the involved particles .    to start our discussion ,",
    "let us assume that the @xmath0-dibaryon is a ( loosely ) bound @xmath8 state and that its binding energy @xmath74 is similar to that of the deuteron @xmath75 .",
    "for pedagogical purposes we fix the value of the flavor - singlet lec @xmath70 in such a way that @xmath76fm ( @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is either @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) , because of the well - known relation between the binding energy and the effective range parameters @xcite @xmath81 this relation is very well fulfilled for the deuteron and the corresponding neutron - proton @xmath13 scattering length ( @xmath82fm ) and effective range ( @xmath83fm ) . one would naively expect that the same should happen for the @xmath0-dibaryon .",
    "however , it turns out that the corresponding results for @xmath1 in the @xmath12 partial wave are quite different , namely @xmath84fm and @xmath85fm . specifically , the effective range is much larger and , moreover , negative",
    ". clearly , the properties of the @xmath0-dibaryon are not comparable to those of the deuteron , despite the fact that both bound states are close to the elastic threshold .",
    "indeed , if one recalls the expressions for the relevant potentials as given in table [ tab:1 ] , @xmath86 one can see that the attraction supplied by the su(3 ) flavor - singlet state ( @xmath64 ) contributes with a much larger weight to the @xmath2 channel than to @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the presumed @xmath0-dibaryon could be predominantly a @xmath2 bound state .",
    "we have confirmed this conjecture by evaluating explicitly the phase shifts in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels , cf .",
    "the discussion in the next section .",
    "indeed , one finds that the phase shift for the @xmath2 channel is rather similar to the @xmath56 @xmath13 case . specifically , the @xmath2 ( @xmath12 ) phase shift @xmath87 fulfills @xmath88 in agreement with the levinson theorem . the @xmath1 ( @xmath12 )",
    "phase behaves rather differently and satisfies @xmath89 .",
    "note that there have been earlier discussions on this issue in the context of @xmath9 baryon - baryon interactions derived within the quark model @xcite .",
    "let us now consider variations of the masses of the involved particles .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 binding energy on the pion mass @xmath90 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] ( left ) . for the case",
    "considered above , enlarging the pion mass to around 400 mev ( i.e. a value corresponding to the nplqcd calculation @xcite ) increases the binding energy to around 8 mev and a further change of @xmath90 to 700 mev ( corresponding roughly to the hal qcd calculation @xcite ) yields then 13 mev , cf . the solid line . readjusting @xmath91 so that we predict a @xmath0 binding energy of 13.2 mev for @xmath92 mev , corresponding to the latest result published by nplqcd  @xcite , yields the dashed curve .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] includes also results of a calculation where @xmath91 was fixed in order to reproduce their earlier value of around 16 mev @xcite ( dash - dotted curve ) , to facilitate a more direct comparison with chiral extrapolations  @xcite based on that value .",
    "it is obvious that the dependence on @xmath90 we get agrees well  at least on a qualitative level  with that presented in ref .",
    "specifically , our calculation exhibits the same trend ( a decrease of the binding energy with decreasing pion mass ) and our binding energy of 9 mev at the physical pion mass is within the error bars of the results given in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we clearly observe a non - linear dependence of the binding energy on the pion mass . as a consequence , scaling our results to the binding energy reported by the hal qcd collaboration @xcite ( 30 - 40 mev for @xmath93  mev ) yields binding energies of more than 20 mev at the physical point , which is certainly outside of the range suggested in ref .",
    "however , we note that for such large pion masses the lo chiral eft can not be trusted quantitatively .",
    "we remark that in our simulations the curves corresponding to different binding energies remained roughly parallel even up to such large values as suggested by the hal qcd collaboration .",
    "our finding that any @xmath0-dibaryon is very likely a bound @xmath2 state rather than a @xmath1 state , which follows from the assumed ( approximate ) su(3 ) symmetry of the interaction , suggests that not only the pion mass but also the masses of the baryons play a significant role for the concrete value of binding energy . indeed",
    ", the physical difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 thresholds of around 26  mev implies that the @xmath0-dibaryon considered above is , in reality , bound by roughly 28  mev with respect to its `` proper '' threshold .",
    "accordingly , one intuitively expects that in a fully su(3 ) symmetric case , where the masses of all octet baryons coincide , the bound state would remain basically fixed to the @xmath2 threshold and then would lie also about 28 mev below the @xmath1 threshold . in the concrete case of @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 we are dealing with three coupled channels , namely @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . since we know from our experience with coupled - channel problems @xcite that coupling effects are sizeable and the actual separation of the various thresholds plays a crucial role we investigated also the dependence of the @xmath0 binding energy on the thresholds ( i.e. on the @xmath94 , and on the @xmath95 and @xmath96 masses ) .",
    "corresponding results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] on the right side .",
    "the solid curve is again the result based on our reference case with a binding energy of -1.87  mev for physical masses of the pion and the baryons .",
    "when we now decrease the @xmath94 mass so that its nominal threshold of 2385  mev moves downwards and finally coincides with the one of the @xmath1 channel ( 2231.2  mev ) , we observe a rather drastic change in the @xmath0 binding energy .",
    "note that the direct interaction in the @xmath11 channel is actually repulsive for the low - energy coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath61 fixed from the @xmath57 data plus the pseudoscalar meson exchange contributions with coupling constants determined from the su(3 ) relations eq .",
    "( [ su3 ] ) . and",
    "it remains repulsive even for @xmath64 values that produce a bound @xmath0-dibaryon .",
    "but the coupling between the channels generates a sizeable effective attraction which increases when the channel thresholds come closer .",
    "the dashed curve is a calculation with the contact term @xmath64 fixed to simulate the binding energy ( -13.2  mev ) of the nplqcd collaboration at @xmath97mev .",
    "as one can see , the dependence on the binding energy on the @xmath94 mass is rather similar .",
    "the curve is simply shifted downwards by around 4.5  mev , i.e. by the difference in the binding energy observed already at the physical masses .",
    "the asterisks and crosses represent results where , besides the variation of the @xmath11 threshold , the @xmath2 threshold is shifted to coincide with that of the @xmath1 channel .",
    "this produces an additional increase of the @xmath0 binding energy by 20  mev at the physical @xmath11 threshold and by 9  mev for that case where all three @xmath8 threshold coincide .",
    "altogether there is an increase in the binding energy of roughly 60  mev when going from the physical point to the case of baryons with identical masses .",
    "this is significantly larger than the variations due to the pion mass considered before .",
    "note that we have kept the pion mass at its physical value while varying the @xmath8 thresholds .",
    "after these exemplary studies let us now try to connect with the published @xmath0 binding energies from the lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by the hal qcd collaboration are obviously for the su(3 ) symmetric case and the corresponding masses are given in table i of ref .",
    "thus , we can take those masses and then fix the lec @xmath91 so that we reproduce their @xmath0 binding energy with those masses . to be concrete ,",
    "we use @xmath98mev and @xmath99mev , and fix @xmath91 so that @xmath100mev .",
    "when we now let the masses of the baryons and mesons go to their physical values the bound state moves upwards , crosses the @xmath1 threshold , crosses also the @xmath2 threshold and then disappears .",
    "in fact , qualitatively this outcome can be already read off from the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] by combining the effects from the variations in the pion and the baryon masses . based on those results",
    "one would expect a shift of the @xmath0 binding energy in the order of 60 to 70  mev for the mass parameters of the hal qcd calculation .    in case of the nplqcd calculation",
    "we take the values provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath101mev , @xmath102mev , @xmath103mev , and @xmath104mev .",
    "those yield then 17  mev for the @xmath2-@xmath1 threshold separation ( to be compared with the physical value of roughly 26  mev ) and 77  mev for the @xmath3-@xmath1 separation ( physical value around 154  mev ) . with those baryon masses",
    "we fix again the lec @xmath91 so that we reproduce the @xmath0 binding energy given by the nplqcd collaboration , namely @xmath105  mev @xcite .",
    "we use also @xmath14mev , but we take the physical masses for the other pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath106 and @xmath42 ) . again",
    "we let the masses of the baryons and of the pion go to their physical values . also here",
    "the bound state moves upwards and crosses the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "however , in the nplqcd case the state survives and remains below the @xmath2 threshold at the physical point .",
    "specifically , we observe a resonance at a kinetic energy of 21  mev in the @xmath1 system or , more precisely , a quasi - bound state in the @xmath2 system around 5  mev below its threshold .",
    "the results reported so far were all obtained with the lecs as fixed from the @xmath57 data for the cutoff value @xmath107  mev @xcite . in order to investigate the stability of our results we considered also variations of the cutoff mass @xmath108 in the ls equation eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) between 550 and 700  mev , as in @xcite , and repeated the exercise described above .",
    "those variations led to changes of the predicted resonance energy in the order of 1  mev only .",
    "even an exploratory calculation that utilizes the low - energy coefficients determined in a preliminary nlo study of the @xmath57 system @xcite yielded practically the same result .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the chiral extrapolation of the lattice qcd results performed by shanahan et al .",
    "@xcite yields results that are similar to ours . in that reference",
    "the authors conclude that the @xmath0-dibaryon is likely to be unbound by 13@xmath10914 mev at the physical point .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that our values are not really comparable with theirs . in our analysis",
    "we assume that the @xmath0-dibaryon is actually a bound @xmath8 state  which seems to be the case also in the lattice qcd studies @xcite . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the @xmath0 is a compact , multi - quark state rather than a loosely bound molecular state .",
    "how such a genuine multi - quark state would be influenced by variations of the @xmath8 thresholds is completely unclear .",
    "it depends , among other things , on whether and how strongly this state couples to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 channels .",
    "so far there is no information on this issue from lattice qcd calculations . clearly , in case of a strong and predominant coupling to the @xmath1 alone , variations of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 would not influence the @xmath0 binding energy significantly .",
    "however , should it couple primarily to the @xmath2 and/or @xmath3 channels then we expect a sensitivity to their thresholds comparable to what we found in our study for the case of a bound state",
    ".    finally , for illustrative purposes , let us show phase shifts for the @xmath12 partial wave of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] .",
    "the solid line is the result for our reference @xmath8 interaction that produces a loosely bound @xmath0 dibaryon with @xmath110 mev .",
    "the phase shift for the @xmath2 channel ( left side ) is rather similar to the one for the @xmath13 @xmath56 partial wave where the deuteron resides , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "specifically , it starts at @xmath111 , decreases smoothly and eventually approaches zero for large energies , fulfilling the levinson theorem .",
    "the result for @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) ( left side ) behaves rather differently .",
    "this phase commences at zero degrees , is first negative but becomes positive within 20 mev and finally turns to zero again for large energies .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the interaction that was fitted to the result of the hal qcd collaboration and reproduces their bound @xmath0 dibaryon with their meson and baryon masses .",
    "the phase shift of the @xmath2 channel , calculated with physical masses , shows no trace of a bound state anymore .",
    "still the phase shift rises up to around @xmath112 near threshold , a behavior quite similar to that of the @xmath12 @xmath56 partial wave where there is a virtual state ( also called antibound state @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , such a virtual state seems to be present too in the @xmath2 channel as a remnant of the original bound state .",
    "the effect of this virtual state can be seen in the @xmath1 phase shift where it leads to an impressive cusp at the opening of the @xmath2 channel , cf .",
    "the dashed line on the left side . in the @xmath2 phase shifts for the nplqcd case ( dash - dotted curve )",
    "the presence of a bound state is clearly visible .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 phase shift exhibits a resonance - like behavior at the energy where the ( quasi - bound ) @xmath0 dibaryon is located .",
    "given the present uncertainties of the lattice qcd results for the @xmath0 dibaryon binding energy we have focused here primarily on qualitative features of the @xmath0 that can be inferred from chiral effective field theory .",
    "clearly , once more precise lattice data become available one should also perform a careful assessment of the uncertainties involved in the eft calculation .",

    "<S> we analyse the quark mass dependence of the binding energy of the @xmath0-dibaryon in the framework of chiral effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the su(3 ) breaking effects induced by the differences of the pertinent two - baryon thresholds ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) have a very pronounced impact that need to be incorporated properly in future lattice qcd simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that if the @xmath0-dibaryon is a two - baryon bound state , its dominant component is @xmath2 rather than @xmath1 , which is a consequence of the approximate su(3 ) flavor symmetry of the two - baryon interactions . </S>"
