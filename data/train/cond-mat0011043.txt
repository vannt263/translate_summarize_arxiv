    "two of the most versatile and most accurate semi - analytical formalisms of microscopic quantum many - body theory ( qmbt ) are the coupled cluster method @xcite and the correlated basis function ( cbf ) method @xcite . in recent years",
    "such qmbt methods , together with various quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques , have been applied with a great deal of success to lattice quantum spin systems at zero temperature .",
    "some typical recent examples of such applications include refs .",
    "@xcite for the ccm , refs .",
    "@xcite for the cbf method , and refs .",
    "@xcite for the various qmc techniques .",
    "current state of the art is such that these methods are sufficiently accurate to describe the various quantum phase transitions between the states of different quantum order that exist in such abundance for spin - lattice systems .",
    "however , each of the above methods is characterised by its own strengths and weaknesses . hence",
    ", a fuller and more complete understanding of such strongly interacting systems as the lattice quantum spin systems is expected to be given by the application of a range of such techniques than by the single application of any one of them . in this article",
    "we wish to apply the ccm , the cbf method , and the variational quantum monte carlo ( vqmc ) method to the spin - half transverse ising model ( for reviews of this model see , for example , refs .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model on a lattice of @xmath0 sites , each of which has @xmath1 nearest - neighbours , is given by @xmath2 where the @xmath3-operators are the usual pauli spin operators and @xmath4 indicates that each of the @xmath5 nearest - neighbour bonds on the lattice is counted once only .",
    "we work in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath6 .",
    "we note that this model has an exact solution in one dimension@xcite ; and approximate techniques , such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite and exact cumulant series expansions@xcite , have also been applied to it for lattices of higher spatial dimensionality . for @xmath7 , we note furthermore that the model contains two distinct phases , with a critical coupling strength @xmath8 depending on lattice type and dimensionality .",
    "for @xmath9 there is non - zero spin ordering in the @xmath1-direction , and hence this regime will be referred to here as the ferromagnetic regime . by contrast , for @xmath10 , all of the ferromagnetic ordering is destroyed , and the classical behaviour of these systems is that the spins lie along the positive @xmath11-axis .",
    "hence , the @xmath10 regime will be referred to here as the paramagnetic regime . in sec .",
    "ii the technical aspects of applying the ccm , the cbf , and the vqmc methods to the spin - half transverse ising model are presented , and in sec .",
    "iii the results of these calculations are discussed . finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section , we firstly describe the general ccm formalism @xcite , and then proceed to apply it to the specific case of the spin - half transverse ising model .",
    "the exact ket and bra ground - state energy eigenvectors , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , of a many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath14 , @xmath15 are parametrised within the single - reference ccm as follows : @xmath16 the single model or reference state @xmath17 is required to have the property of being a cyclic vector with respect to two well - defined abelian subalgebras of _ multi - configurational _ creation operators @xmath18 and their hermitian - adjoint destruction counterparts @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 plays the role of a vacuum state with respect to a suitable set of ( mutually commuting ) many - body creation operators @xmath18 , @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the identity operator .",
    "these operators are complete in the many - body hilbert ( or fock ) space , @xmath22 also , the _ correlation operator _",
    "@xmath23 is decomposed entirely in terms of these creation operators @xmath18 , which , when acting on the model state ( @xmath24 ) , create excitations from it .",
    "we note that although the manifest hermiticity , ( @xmath25 ) , is lost , the intermediate normalisation condition @xmath26 is explicitly imposed .",
    "the _ correlation coefficients _",
    "@xmath27 are regarded as being independent variables , even though formally we have the relation , @xmath28 the full set @xmath27 thus provides a complete description of the ground state . for instance , an arbitrary operator @xmath29 will have a ground - state expectation value given as , @xmath30 we note that the exponentiated form of the ground - state ccm parametrisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ensures the correct counting of the _ independent _ and excited correlated many - body clusters with respect to @xmath17 which are present in the exact ground state @xmath12 .",
    "it also ensures the exact incorporation of the goldstone linked - cluster theorem , which itself guarantees the size - extensivity of all relevant extensive physical quantities .",
    "the determination of the correlation coefficients @xmath27 is achieved by taking appropriate projections onto the ground - state schrdinger equations of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , they may be determined variationally by requiring the ground - state energy expectation functional @xmath31 , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , to be stationary with respect to variations in each of the ( independent ) variables of the full set .",
    "we thereby easily derive the following coupled set of equations , @xmath32 { \\rm e}^s|\\phi\\rangle   = 0 , \\;\\ ; i \\neq 0 \\;\\ ; . \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq7 ] ) also shows that the ground - state energy at the stationary point has the simple form @xmath33 it is important to realize that this ( bi-)variational formulation does _ not _ lead to an upper bound for @xmath34 when the summations for @xmath23 and @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) are truncated , due to the lack of exact hermiticity when such approximations are made .",
    "however , it is clear that the important hellmann - feynman theorem _ is _ preserved in all such approximations .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) represents a coupled set of nonlinear multinomial equations for the _ c_-number correlation coefficients @xmath36 . the nested commutator expansion of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian , @xmath37 + { 1\\over2 ! } [ [ h , s],s ] + \\cdots   \\;\\ ; ,   \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] together with the fact that all of the individual components of @xmath23 in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) commute with one another , imply that each element of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is linked directly to the hamiltonian in each of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "thus , each of the coupled equations ( [ eq7 ] ) is of linked cluster type .",
    "furthermore , each of these equations is of finite length when expanded , since the otherwise infinite series of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) will always terminate at a finite order , provided ( as is usually the case ) that each term in the second - quantised form of the hamiltonian @xmath14 contains a finite number of single - body destruction operators , defined with respect to the reference ( vacuum ) state @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the ccm parametrisation naturally leads to a workable scheme which can be efficiently implemented computationally .",
    "it is also important to note that at the heart of the ccm lies a similarity transformation , in contrast with the unitary transformation in a standard variational formulation in which the bra state @xmath38 is simply taken as the explicit hermitian adjoint of @xmath12 .",
    "the ccm formalism is exact in the limit of inclusion of all possible multi - spin cluster correlations for @xmath23 and @xmath39 , although in any real application this is usually impossible to achieve .",
    "it is therefore necessary to utilise various approximation schemes within @xmath23 and @xmath35 .",
    "the three most commonly employed schemes previously utilised have been : ( 1 ) the sub@xmath40 scheme , in which all correlations involving only @xmath40 or fewer spins are retained , but no further restriction is made concerning their spatial separation on the lattice ; ( 2 ) the sub@xmath40-@xmath41 sub - approximation , in which all sub@xmath40 correlations spanning a range of no more than @xmath41 adjacent lattice sites are retained ; and ( 3 ) the localised lsub@xmath41 scheme , in which all multi - spin correlations over distinct locales on the lattice defined by @xmath41 or fewer contiguous sites are retained .",
    "the specific application of the ccm to the spin - half transverse ising model in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes is now described .      in the paramagnetic regime , a model state",
    "is utilised in which all spins point along the @xmath11-axis , although it is found to be useful to rotate the local spin coordinates of these spins such that all spins in the model state point in the ` downwards ' direction ( i.e. , along the negative @xmath1-axis ) .",
    "this ( canonical ) transformation is given by , @xmath42 such that the transverse ising hamiltonian of eq .",

    "in these local coordinates the model state is thus the `` ferromagnetic '' state @xmath45 in which all spins point in the downwards direction . in order to reflect the symmetries of this hamiltonian ,",
    "the cluster correlations within @xmath23 are explicitly restricted to those for which @xmath46 ( in the rotated coordinate frame ) is an even number .",
    "hence , the lsub2 approximation is defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 covers all nearest - neighbour lattice vectors .",
    "the ground - state energy is now given in terms of @xmath49 by , @xmath50 it is found that this expression is valid for any level of approximation for @xmath23 .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) it is found that , @xmath51 and hence an approximate solution for the ground - state energy at the lsub2 approximation level purely in terms of @xmath52 may be obtained .",
    "the sub2 approximation contains all possible two - body correlations , for a given lattice , and is defined by @xmath53 where the index @xmath54 indicates a lattice vector .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) may once again be utilised to determine the sub2 ket - state equations .",
    "hence the ccm sub2 ket - state equation corresponding to a two - body correlation characterised by index @xmath55 is given by , @xmath56 we note that this equation is meaningful only for @xmath57 as we may only ever have one pauli raising operator per lattice site .",
    "this equation may be solved by performing a fourier transformation .",
    "( details of how this is achieved in practice are not given here and the interested reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite . ) an alternative approach , however , is to use eq .",
    "( [ sub2 ] ) in order to fully define the sub2-@xmath41 equations .",
    "this is achieved by truncating the range of the two - body correlations ( i.e. , by setting @xmath58 ) , and the corresponding sub2-@xmath41 equations may be solved numerically via the newton - raphson technique ( or other such techniques ) .",
    "we note that coupled sets of high - order lsub@xmath41 equations may be derived using computer - algebraic techniques , as discussed in ref .",
    "the technicalities of these calculations are not considered here , but the interested reader is referred to ref .",
    "a full discussion of the ccm results based on the paramagnetic model state is deferred until sec .",
    "iii .      in the ferromagnetic regime",
    ", a model state is chosen in which all spins point ` downwards ' ( along the negative @xmath1-axis ) , and so the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) may therefore be utilised directly within the ccm calculations .",
    "the lowest order approximation is the now sub1 approximation ( in which case , @xmath59 ) and the ground - state energy is given in terms of @xmath60 by , @xmath61 it is again noted that this expression is valid for any level of approximation in @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", it is found that the solution of the sub2 approximation collapses onto the lsub2 solution due to the simple nature of the hamiltonian and model state , although it is again possible to perform high - order lsub@xmath41 calculations .",
    "furthermore , the lattice magnetisation ( i.e. , the magnetisation in the @xmath1-direction ) , @xmath62 , is defined within the ccm framework by , @xmath63 which may be determined once both the ket- and bra - state equations have been solved at a given level of approximation .",
    "again , the discussion of the results for this model state is deferred until section iii .",
    "the treatment of the transverse ising model by the cbf method is begun by defining the lattice magnetisation ( i.e. , again the magnetisation in the @xmath1-direction ) , given by @xmath64 for a ground - state trial wave function , @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , the ` transverse ' magnetisation is given by , @xmath66 it is also found to be useful to define a spatial distribution function ( which plays a crucial part in any cbf calculation ) in the following manner , @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding approximation to the ground - state energy per spin is given by @xmath69 where the function @xmath70 is equal to unity when @xmath71 is a nearest - neighbour lattice vector and is zero elsewhere .",
    "it is noted that the distribution function @xmath72 may be decomposed according to @xmath73 such that @xmath74 now contains the short - range part of the spatial distribution function and vanishes in the limit @xmath75 .",
    "the magnetisation , @xmath62 , and the transverse magnetisation , @xmath29 , may now be expressed in a factorised form in terms of a ` spin - exchange strength ' , @xmath76 , such that , @xmath77 the energy functional is now expressed in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath76 as , @xmath78 note that in the mean - field approximation @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) is set to zero ( for all @xmath71 ) and @xmath76 is set to unity .",
    "in order to determine the ground - state energy and other such ground - state expectation values , a hartree - jastrow ansatz is now introduced , given by @xmath79 the reference state @xmath80 is a tensor product of spin states which have eigenvalues of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath82 .",
    "the correlation operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 are written in terms of pseudopotentials , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 the pseudopotential @xmath90 is independent of the lattice position by translational invariance , and the pseudopotentials , @xmath85 and @xmath87 , similarly depend only on the relative distance , @xmath91 .",
    "the jastrow correlations are determined via a cluster expansion of the various quantities in the hamiltonian , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite . a common approximation yields the hypernetted chain ( hnc/0 ) equations , which one may solve iteratively in order to determine the hartree - jastrow pseudopotentials .",
    "one then wishes to determine the expectation values such as the ground - state energy , and in the paramagnetic regime an explicit assumption is made that @xmath92 . however , in the ferromagnetic regime @xmath62 is taken to be a variational parameter with respect to the ground - state energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "there are now two ways of determining the pseudopotentials from the hnc equations .",
    "the first such approach is to assume that the pseudopotential has the simple parametrised form , @xmath93 where @xmath70 is unity if @xmath71 is a nearest - neighbour lattice vector and is zero otherwise .",
    "this approach is henceforth denoted as the parametrised hnc cbf method .",
    "the @xmath94-number @xmath95 is taken to be a variational parameter with respect to which the ground - state energy is minimized . in the paramagnetic regime ,",
    "the minimum of the energy surface as a function of @xmath95 is sought , at a given value of @xmath52 .",
    "this is easily performed computationally , and the solution is readily tracked iteratively , starting from the trivial limit @xmath96 and then moving to smaller values of @xmath52 . in the ferromagnetic regime , one again searches for a minimum of the energy surface , but this time with respect to both @xmath95 and @xmath62 , at a given value of @xmath52 . in this case , one tracks from the trivial limit of @xmath97 to higher values of @xmath52 . in previous articles@xcite ,",
    "this was achieved by analytically determining the derivative of the energy with respect to @xmath62 , although in this article a computational minimisation of the energy is performed with respect to both variables .",
    "the second such approach allows one to find the optimal pseudopotential within the cbf / hnc framework from a functional minimisation , @xmath98 within the context of this article , this is henceforth denoted as the _ paired phonon approximation _",
    "( ppa ) ( or , more precisely , the paired magnon approximation ) , and the corresponding equations are the ppa equations .",
    "note that in this article the ppa calculation is only performed in the paramagnetic regime , although ppa results in the ferromagnetic regime have also been performed previously@xcite .",
    "( indeed , results for the phase transition points predicted by the ppa cbf approach of ref.@xcite are quoted in the table [ tab1 ] . ) a full discussion of the results of the cbf calculations presented in this section , in comparison to the corresponding results of the ccm and the vqmc method , is given in section iii .",
    "although the specific variational calculations presented in this article concentrate on the spin - half transverse ising model , we note that the formalism presented in this section is given in a generalised form and that the treatment of other spin models would follow a similar pattern .",
    "we shall specifically consider here the transverse ising model in the ferromagnetic regime where the relevant hamiltonian is defined by eq .",

    "however , such a calculation is soon limited by the rapidly increasing set of ising states and the amount of computational power available .",

    "a discussion of the results of the variational calculations discussed here is given in section iii .",
    "in this section we consider how the results of each method are determined in the infinite lattice limit .",
    "firstly , it is noted that the ccm method produces expectation values which are size - extensive ( i.e. , the numerical values of each expectation value scale linearly with @xmath0 ) , and we always deal with an infinite lattice in all calculations from the very outset . furthermore , the ` raw ' ccm lsub@xmath41 results based on the ferromagnetic model state are found to converge rapidly with increasing lsub@xmath41 approximation level @xmath41 over most of the ferromagnetic regime except for a region very near to the phase transition point . in order to obtain even better results for the ccm method across the whole of this regime , a simple extrapolation of the lsub@xmath41 data in the limit",
    "@xmath142 has also been carried out at each value of @xmath52 separately .",
    "the results of the extrapolation using a leading - order ` power - law ' dependence ( see appendix a for details ) are denoted as extrapolated(1 ) ccm results and results of a pad approximation for @xmath143 ( again , see appendix a for details ) are called extrapolated(2 ) ccm results . in the paramagnetic regime ,",
    "the results for the ground - state energy are found to converge extremely rapidly with lsub@xmath41 approximation level over the whole of this regime and so no extrapolation of these results is necessary .    for the cbf method , although the treatment presented here is formally valid for any lattice size ( including the infinite lattice case ) , the results presented have been obtained for finite - sized lattices .",
    "the results are found to converge extremely rapidly with increasing lattice size , and the results of the 20@xmath14420 square lattice ( used in the figures given below ) are found to be essentially fully converged for all @xmath52 except for a region very near to the critical point .",
    "the results for the vqmc method presented below have been obtained for a 16@xmath14416 square lattice , where the number of monte carlo iterations was set to 50000 . as for the cbf calculations , the 16@xmath14416 lattice is again expected to be large enough for the vqmc results to be essentially fully converged to the infinite lattice limit for all values of @xmath52 except for a region near to the critical point . by comparing the results of a 10@xmath14410 lattice vqmc calculation with those of a 16@xmath14416 lattice it was found that this was indeed true .",
    "furthermore , we note that for small @xmath52 the variational minimum of the ground - state energy was found to be rather flat with respect to the variational parameters @xmath60 and @xmath112 , and the ground - state energy was also highly converged with increasing lattice size .",
    "however , as the phase transition point is approached one finds that a precise evaluation of the position of the variational minimum with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath112 becomes harder to determine .",
    "the results for the ground - state energy per spin of the spin - half transverse ising model on the square lattice in the ferromagnetic regime are shown in fig .",
    "we see from this figure that excellent correspondence between the results of the ccm , cbf , and vqmc methods for the ground - state energy is obtained in this regime .",
    "we note , however , that the extrapolated ccm results appear to lie very slightly lower than the other two sets of results , especially near to the phase transition point .",
    "this indicates the increasing importance of higher - order correlations for the ground - state energy near to the phase transition point .",
    "the results for the lattice magnetisation @xmath62 obtained using the ccm , cbf , and vqmc formalisms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( and also fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in appendix a ) for the spin - half transverse ising model on the square lattice .",
    "we note that the ` raw ' ccm lsub@xmath41 results for the lattice magnetisation do not become zero at any value of @xmath52 for any finite value of the truncation index @xmath41 , because all of the ferromagnetic order inherent in the model state must be destroyed in order for @xmath62 to be zero in this case . in practice",
    "this is a difficult thing for the ccm to achieve with this model state .",
    "however , we may see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the extrapolated ccm results are in excellent agreement with those results of the cbf and vqmc methods .",
    "in addition , it is possible to imagine other ccm model states , such as a spin - flop model state or a mean - field model state , in which the lattice magnetisation with respect to this state is not _ a priori _ fully saturated for all @xmath52",
    ". furthermore , we remark that a treatment of this problem with the ferromagnetic model state using the extended coupled cluster method ( eccm ) @xcite would present an interesting challenge .    in the paramagnetic regime , the ground - state energy per spin for the transverse ising model on the square lattice",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "the ` raw ' ccm lsub@xmath41 results for the ground - state energy are already highly converged with increasing truncation index @xmath41 , even up to the phase transition point . we note again that an extrapolation in the limit @xmath142 is therefore not necessary .",
    "indeed , good correspondence between the results of the different methods is seen although it is noted that ccm lsub4 and lsub6 ground - state energies lie lower than those predicted by the cbf .",
    "this indicates that high - order order correlations become increasingly important the nearer one gets to the phase transition point .",
    "however , this could be rectified , in principle , for the cbf method by the inclusion of higher - order ( than pairwise jastrow ) correlations in the ground - state wave function .",
    "we note that in practice , however , the inclusion of such higher - order correlations in the ground - state wave function in the cbf and vqmc methods is a difficult and unresolved question .",
    "it is also possible to determine the second - derivative of the ground - state energy per spin with respect to @xmath52 for the ccm calculations based on the paramagnetic model state , defined by @xmath145 it is found that @xmath146 diverges at some critical value @xmath8 for the sub2 approximation in any dimension , and for sub2-@xmath41 and lsub@xmath41 ( with @xmath147 ) approximations for spatial dimensionality greater than one .",
    "again , this behaviour is associated with a phase transition in the real system and the point at which this occurs is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "correspondingly , ccm results for @xmath9 based on the paramagnetic model state do no exist , and hence @xmath8 acts as a terminating point for the calculation in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "also , it is found that the sub2-@xmath41 results for @xmath8 as a function of @xmath41 scale with @xmath148 and a simple linear extrapolation gives the full sub2 result for the critical point to within a @xmath149 accuracy . by analogy , this rule has also been used for the lsub@xmath41 results to extrapolate to the limit @xmath142 , and the results thus determined are shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the values thus obtained are also in good agreement with the points at which @xmath150 from the extrapolations in the ferromagnetic regime discussed above ( and see fig . 2 for the square lattice case ) .    for the cbf and vqmc methods the point , in terms of @xmath52 , at",

    "in this article , results of the ccm , cbf , and vqmc approaches for the ground - state energy , the lattice magnetisation , and the position of the critical point of the spin - half transverse ising model on various lattices have been presented .",
    "these results have been seen to be in excellent agreement both with each other and with those results of exact calculations for the linear chain and those of exact cumulant series expansions for higher spatial dimensionality . indeed , by treating these systems using three separate approaches , it has been shown that each set of results has been mutually supported and reinforced by those of the other approaches .",
    "furthermore , we have gained some insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach .",
    "this is exemplified in the different parametrisations of the ground - state wave function .",
    "the cbf and vqmc approaches both utilise jastrow wave functions and their bra states are always the explicit hermitian adjoints of the corresponding ket states .",
    "hence , for the cbf and vqmc approaches , an upper bound to the true ground - state energy is , in principle , obtainable , although the approximations made in calculating the energy may destroy it .",
    "by contrast , the ccm uses a bi - variational approach in which the bra and ket states are not manifestly constrained to be hermitian adjoints and hence an upper bound to the true ground - state energy is not necessarily obtained .",
    "also , the ccm uses creation operators with respect to some suitably normalised model state in order to span the complete set of ( here ) ising states .",
    "the other approaches , in essence , use projection operators to form the hartree and the jastrow correlations . for the cbf case ,",
    "this is with respect to a reference state , whereas for the vqmc case , the hartree - jastrow ansatz is encoded within the expansion coefficients of the ground - state wave function with respect to a complete set of ising states . in some sense , the ccm is found to contain _ less _ correlations than the others at ` equivalent ' levels of approximation ( e.g. , the ccm lsub2 approximation versus hartree and nearest - neighbour jastrow correlations ) . a fuller account of the different parametrisations of the ground - state wave function within the ccm and cbf methods has been given in ref . @xcite .",
    "however , in practice the other methods are difficult to extend to approximations which contain more than two - body or three - body correlations . by contrast",
    ", the ccm is well - suited to treat such higher - order correlations via computational techniques , as has been demonstrated here .",
    "furthermore , the ccm requires no information other than the approximation in @xmath23 and @xmath39 in order to determine an approximate ground state of a given system .",
    "the cbf method , however , may require that only a certain subset of all possible diagrams are summed over ( e.g. , the hnc/0 approximation ) .",
    "the vqmc approach also often requires an intimate knowledge of the manner in which the two - body correlations behave with increasing lattice separation if all two - body correlations are to be included .",
    "this information may be approximated , for example , by use of the results of spin - wave theory . in any case",
    ", it is often necessary to reduce the minimisation of the variational ground - state energy with respect to @xmath0 parameters to much fewer parameters .",
    "another potential application of all of the methods presented here is the use of their ground - state wave functions as trial or guiding wave functions in ( green function or similar ) quantum monte carlo calculations .    finally , encouraged by these results for the transverse ising model ,",
    "we intend to extend them to other models of interest , such as systems with higher quantum spin number or those with complex crystallographic lattices .",
    "a further goal is to extend the treatment of this and other spin models , via these methods , to non - zero temperatures .",

    "in this appendix , we explain how we extrapolate a set of lsub@xmath41 data points , @xmath154 , in the limit @xmath155 at each value of some parameter ( @xmath52 ) within the hamiltonian separately .",
    "note that the number of data elements to be extrapolated is given by the index @xmath156 .",
    "the value of @xmath157 is now set to be @xmath158 and @xmath159 is set to be the corresponding value of an expectation value ( for example , the lattice magnetisation ) determined using the ccm at this level of approximation at a given value of @xmath52 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath41 must increase with increasing index @xmath111 , although @xmath41 and @xmath111 do not have to be equal .",
    "before the extrapolation procedures are given in detail , we define some useful quantities .",
    "firstly , the mean value of a set @xmath160 is denoted by @xmath161 and of a set @xmath162 is denoted by @xmath163 .",
    "secondly , the linear correlation , @xmath164 , of a set of two - dimensional points , @xmath165 , is defined by @xmath166 we are now in a position to outline the the first extrapolation procedure .",
    "this procedure firstly assumes that the data scales with a leading - order `` power - law '' dependence , given by @xmath167 we set @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath154 is the lsub@xmath41 data set at some fixed value of a parameter within the hamiltonian .",
    "hence the best fit of the data set , @xmath154 , to the power - law dependence of eq .",
    "( [ app2 ] ) is obtained when the absolute value of @xmath164 is maximised with respect to the variable @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , we make the assumption that this value of @xmath60 is then taken to be the extrapolated value of the @xmath159 in the limit @xmath170 ( in which case , @xmath171 ) .    the second extrapolation procedure of the lsub@xmath41 data uses pad approximants .",
    "this is achieved by firstly assuming that the set of data can be modeled by the ratio of two polynomials , given by @xmath172 note that when @xmath143 , this is a simple integral power series .",
    "this furthermore implies that , @xmath173 we now wish to determine the coefficients @xmath174 and @xmath175 in order to find the polynomials in eq .",
    "( [ app3 ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ app4 ] ) is rewritten in terms of a matrix given by , @xmath176 the inverse of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ app5 ] ) is now obtained and the coefficients @xmath174 and @xmath175 are determined .",
    "( note that @xmath177 . )",
    "however , we also note that because @xmath171 as @xmath155 , @xmath178 gives us the extrapolated value of @xmath179 in the limit @xmath142 .",
    "furthermore , using this method with @xmath143 we found that a previous extrapolated result@xcite of ccm lsub@xmath41 data for the _ sublattice magnetisation _ of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice was reproduced . in this previous calculation@xcite",
    ", the sublattice magnetisation was extrapolated in the limit @xmath142 by fitting the lsub@xmath41 points ( with @xmath180 ) to a quadratic function in @xmath158 thus giving an extrapolated value of about @xmath181 .    in this article , we have already plotted extrapolated ccm lsub@xmath41 results for the lattice magnetisation of the square lattice spin - half transverse ising model in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and these results were seen to be in excellent agreement with those results of cbf and vqmc calculations . however , a further discussion of the extrapolated ccm results presented here is also useful in order to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the extrapolation procedures outlined in this appendix .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] below that the results for the pad approximant extrapolation with @xmath182 contains a zero in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ app3 ] ) at about @xmath183 such that the results show a divergence for @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which is simply an _ artifact _ of the extrapolation procedure .",
    "this is because an assumption is made as to the scaling of the lsub@xmath41 data with @xmath158 to some functional form .",
    "the validity of this assumption is unknown as no exact scaling laws are known , as yet , for the behaviour of ccm lsub@xmath41 results as functions of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the empirical evidence in fig . [ fig4 ] suggests that this is a reasonable assumption over much of the ferromagnetic phase , except , of course , for those points at which the pad approximant results demonstrate this ` artificial ' divergence .",
