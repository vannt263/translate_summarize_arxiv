    "the @xmath0 deformation of the @xmath1 superstring @xcite is a deformation of the semi - symmetric space supercoset action of @xcite with @xmath10-deformed @xmath3 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the construction generalises the deformation of two bosonic models , the principal chiral @xcite and the symmetric space sigma model @xcite .",
    "the theory remains integrable and has a form of @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "as such it was a natural candidate to describe a type iib green - schwarz superstring , recovering the familiar @xmath1 model in the undeformed limit .    whether this deformation of the @xmath1 superstring is itself a superstring theory has by now been thoroughly investigated",
    "the first approach taken was to determine the metric and @xmath12-field @xcite and , investigating certain limits and truncations @xcite , attempt to find a dilaton and r - r fluxes that complete the ns - ns fields to a type iib supergravity solution @xcite .",
    "this approach was partially successful , however it was unclear whether the resulting backgrounds matched the expansion of the supercoset action or corresponded to an integrable worldsheet sigma model . in @xcite the deformed semi - symmetric space supercoset action was expanded to quadratic order in fermions and the r - r fluxes extracted .",
    "it transpired that there is no dilaton that completes the ns - ns fields and r - r fluxes to a type iib supergravity solution .    while this story has been partially understood by considering the t - dual background , which is a type iib@xmath13 supergravity solution , albeit with a dilaton breaking the isometries @xcite , there are other puzzling aspects to the results of @xcite .",
    "the first is the so - called mirror , or contraction , limit , in which the deformation parameter is taken to infinity .",
    "taking this limit in the deformed metric and @xmath12-field gives the t - dual of @xmath14 with vanishing @xmath12-field @xcite .",
    "this background matches the bosonic background of the mirror @xmath1 superstring , the background of the sigma model that is related to the @xmath1 one by a worldsheet double wick rotation once a light cone gauge is fixed .",
    "this limit was inspired by the mirror duality of the exact @xmath10-deformed @xmath6-matrix @xcite  meaning its invariance under inversion of the deformation parameter combined with a mirror transformation ( double wick rotation )  which at a geometric level extends to the deformed bosonic background @xcite .",
    "based on this structure a conjecture was made for the form of the r - r fluxes and dilaton in this maximal deformation limit @xcite , matching the double wick rotation of the @xmath1 fermions @xcite .",
    "however , the limit of the r - r fluxes found in @xcite does not match the conjecture of @xcite and furthermore does not respect the geometric mirror duality of @xcite which would naturally imply the algebraic one of the exact @xmath6-matrix @xcite .",
    "the converse  mirror duality of the @xmath6-matrix implying geometric mirror duality  does not hold , but it is natural to expect it to be the case .",
    "this is related to the second puzzle just below .",
    "algebraically , this maximal deformation limit can be understood as a contraction of the @xmath10-deformed symmetry algebra to a @xmath11-poincar type algebra @xcite .",
    "in particular , in this limit the symmetry algebra of the @xmath0-deformed @xmath1 superstring is a contraction of the @xmath10-deformed @xmath3 that contains the light - cone gauge symmetry of the mirror model as a subalgebra @xcite .",
    "the second puzzle relates to the light - cone gauge @xmath6-matrix itself . considering a bmn - type light - cone gauge ,",
    "the two - particle tree - level @xmath6-matrix elements for two bosons and two fermions were computed in @xcite .",
    "the four boson amplitudes were computed earlier in @xcite . as a consequence of the new amplitudes",
    "the tree - level @xmath6-matrix no longer satisfies the classical yang - baxter equation .",
    "a two - particle change of basis was constructed that relates the tree - level result to the @xmath6-matrix that follows from symmetries and satisfies the classical yang - baxter equation .",
    "however , it remains to be understood if this change of basis can be extended to arbitrary orders and an arbitrary number of excitations .",
    "the deformed model depends on a constant antisymmetric solution of the modified classical yang - baxter equation ( mcybe ) for the superalgebra @xmath3 .",
    "a particular solution was considered in @xcite and henceforth much of the investigation into the deformation has been based on this choice . however , there are other inequivalent options .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the effect of considering these different choices on both the background geometries and the light - cone gauge @xmath6-matrices , in particular to see if they could help to resolve the puzzles of @xcite    we will focus on the deformed bosonic @xmath1 model .",
    "therefore the action of interest is the deformation of the symmetric space sigma model for the coset @xmath15",
    "@xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the would - be effective string tension , @xmath18 is the worldsheet metric with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the field @xmath21 takes values in the group @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an appropriately normalised invariant bilinear form . as @xmath15 is a symmetric space",
    ", @xmath24 has a @xmath25 outer automorphism , with the grade @xmath26 space given by the subalgebra @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 then denotes the projector onto the grade @xmath29 space .",
    "the operator @xmath30 is a linear map from @xmath31 to itself .",
    "provided it is antisymmetric , @xmath32 and satisfies the non - split or split mcybe @xmath33 - r([r(m),n ] + [ m , r(n)])=\\pm[m , n ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the deformed model is classically integrable . here",
    "the plus sign corresponds to non - split and the minus sign to split . in the non - split case",
    "we use the deformation parameter @xmath34 of @xcite , which is related to the parameter @xmath0 of @xcite by @xmath35 and to that of @xcite by @xmath36 . in the split case",
    "we use the deformation parameter @xmath37 . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume these to be positive .",
    "when these parameters are set to zero we recover the action for the symmetric space sigma model as expected .    using the bilinear form",
    "the operator @xmath30 can be represented by an @xmath2 matrix , i.e. @xmath38 with @xmath39 where the @xmath40 are generators of @xmath31 and the @xmath41 . in this article",
    "we will refer to both the operator @xmath30 and its matrix representation @xmath2 as the @xmath2 matrix , where the latter satisfies the mcybe in the form @xmath42+[r_{12},r_{23}]+[r_{13},r_{23 } ] = \\pm \\omega \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath43 denotes the matrix realisation of @xmath2 acting in spaces @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the triple tensor product , while @xmath46 is the canonical invariant element of @xmath47 with its overall scale fixed such that the plus ( respectively minus ) sign in corresponds to the non - split ( respectively split ) mcybe .",
    "the @xmath2 matrices we study in this article are those for @xmath4 and @xmath48 , the isometry algebras of @xmath5 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "furthermore , we will focus on inequivalent solutions of the mcybe , that is up to inner automorphisms , and also up to compatible solutions of the classical yang - baxter equation ( cybe ) @xmath50 - r([r(m),n ] + [ m , r(n)])= 0 \\ .\\ ] ] in particular , we fix the latter requirement by the condition @xmath51 ( where the minus sign corresponds to the non - split case and the plus sign to the split case ) .    both @xmath4 and @xmath48 are real forms of the complex lie algebra @xmath52 . to the best of our knowledge @xcite",
    "there are three inequivalent solutions of the non - split and one of the split mcybe for the real form @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , for the compact real form @xmath48 there is a single solution of the non - split mcybe and no split solutions .",
    "therefore , while the three non - split @xmath4 @xmath2 matrices can be extended to inequivalent solutions for @xmath3 , the same is not true for the split case .",
    "even so , considering the latter is still useful due to the existence of non - trivial limits in which it solves the cybe .",
    "such limits also exist for the non - split @xmath2 matrices .",
    "these @xmath2 matrices can be extended to solutions of the cybe for @xmath3 , which can also be used to define deformations of the @xmath1 superstring @xcite .",
    "the limits turn out to be particularly useful for investigating in which cases these deformations correspond to type iib superstrings @xcite .",
    "this class of deformations of the principal chiral , symmetric space and semi - symmetric space sigma models based on solutions to the cybe and mcybe are referred to as yang - baxter deformations @xcite . here , to distinguish these two cases we will refer to those based on the mcybe ( respectively cybe ) as inhomogeneous ( respectively homogeneous ) yang - baxter deformations .",
    "we will also refer to the specific model studied in @xcite and subsequent papers as the @xmath0 deformation .",
    "we consider the three non - split solutions and one split solution of the mcybe for @xmath4 and the corresponding deformations of @xmath5 .",
    "in section [ sec : deformations ] , for each @xmath2 matrix we extract the geometry and @xmath12-field , with the sign of the latter defined by @xmath53 furthermore , in the non - split case we show that the three backgrounds are related by real diffeomorphisms , although there are still three regions separated by singularities .",
    "the section is concluded with three more general discussions .",
    "in the first we explore the contraction limits of the deformed models .",
    "the second outlines how one could use analytic continuations and the results of @xcite to conjecture the corresponding r - r fluxes for the various @xmath2 matrices , while the third demonstrates , for the @xmath54 case , how the different backgrounds appear as limits of the gauged - wzw deformation @xcite . in section [ sec : smat ]",
    "we return to @xmath1 and the three non - split @xmath2 matrices .",
    "computing the bosonic two - particle tree - level @xmath6-matrices for four inequivalent bmn - type light - cone gauges ( discussed in the appendix ) we find differing results .",
    "however the @xmath6-matrices are related by momentum - dependent one - particle changes of basis .",
    "we finish in section [ sec : conclusions ] with some concluding remarks and open questions .",
    "in this section we will discuss the various inhomogeneous yang - baxter deformations , non - split and split , of @xmath5 .",
    "the isometry group of @xmath5 is @xmath55 . in each case",
    "the deformation only preserves a cartan subgroup , i.e. three commuting isometries . in the non - split case",
    "this symmetry is @xmath56 while in the split case it is @xmath57 .",
    "the defining matrix representation of the algebra @xmath58 can be taken as @xmath59 for which we use the following basis @xcite @xmath60 \\ , \\qquad    m^{i5 } = - m^{5i } = \\frac12 \\gamma^i \\ , \\qquad i = 0,\\ldots,4 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the generators @xmath64 then satisfy the standard @xmath65 commutation relations @xmath66",
    "= \\eta^{jk}m^{il } - \\eta^{ik}m^{jl } - \\eta^{jl } m^{ik } + \\eta^{il}m^{jk } \\",
    ", \\qquad i , j , k , l = 0,\\ldots , 5 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the metric with which we raise and lower indices .",
    "the symmetric space @xmath5 is equivalent to the coset @xmath68 .",
    "we take the gauge algebra @xmath69 to be generated by @xmath64 , @xmath70 , and hence @xmath28 in projects onto the space spanned by @xmath71 .",
    "our starting point for the discussion of non - split @xmath2 matrices for @xmath4 , equivalently @xmath65 , and the associated deformations of @xmath5 is the case much studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "decomposing a matrix @xmath44 taking values in the @xmath4 representation into its diagonal and upper and lower triangular parts ( denoted @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively ) , the standard @xmath2 matrix acts as @xmath75 which one can check preserves the defining relations , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "new @xmath2 matrices can then be constructed from the canonical one using a constant element @xmath79 , however elements proportional to the identity will give the same @xmath2 matrix . ]",
    "( given here by invertible elements of @xmath80 with unit determinant ) @xmath81 for the resulting @xmath82 to be a non - split @xmath2 matrix for @xmath4 , it should preserve the defining relations . furthermore , we say two @xmath2 matrices are equivalent if @xmath83 since the corresponding transformation can then be understood as an inner automorphism of the algebra .",
    "alternatively in the deformed action the matrix @xmath84 can be absorbed into the definition of the group - valued field @xmath21 .",
    "the problem of classifying inequivalent non - split @xmath2 matrices for non - compact real forms is an open question .",
    "therefore , here we will consider the three inequivalent non - split @xmath2 matrices for the algebra @xmath4 discussed in @xcite .",
    "these are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 \\ , \\qquad p_2 = \\begin{psmallmatrix } 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & i \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & i & 0 & 0 \\end{psmallmatrix } = \\exp\\big[-\\frac{i\\pi}2 ( m^{04 } - m^{35})\\big ] \\ , \\qquad\\ ] ] from these expressions we can immediately see that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not in @xmath89 , however , one can check they do preserve the defining relations .",
    "they are related to the permutations of @xcite by @xmath89 transformations and multiples of the identity .",
    "one can check that their action on the signature matrix @xmath90 takes the expected form @xmath91 written in terms of the basis , the @xmath2 matrices associated to the operators @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are @xmath95    another way to arrive at these @xmath2 matrices is to start from the unique @xmath52 @xmath2 matrix of the form @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are positive and negative roots , and fix the real form @xmath4 , which can be done in multiple inequivalent ways . in a twist on this picture , we can first fix the compact real form @xmath48  for which there is only one non - split @xmath2 matrix up to inner automorphisms  and analytically continue to @xmath4 . in @xcite . ] in our conventions this @xmath2 matrix is @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , are the generators of @xmath48 .",
    "it arises from the @xmath52 @xmath2 matrix by identifying the roots of @xmath52 in terms of the generators @xmath100 .",
    "this can be done in many ways as any permutation of the indices @xmath102 or @xmath103 transformation gives an admissible @xmath2 matrix . however , the former leave the @xmath2 matrix invariant up to inner automorphisms , while the latter are just inner automorphisms themselves .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the non - compact case these choices do not affect the @xmath2 matrix .    to analytically continue from @xmath104 to @xmath58",
    "we can think in terms of the @xmath105 associated to @xmath106 , and analytically continue a two - plane to obtain the @xmath107 of @xmath65 .",
    "note that up to inner automorphisms ( and hence permutations of indices ) of the @xmath48 @xmath2 matrix we can choose this two - plane to be associated to the span of any two indices , where analytic continuation corresponds to `` multiplying these indices by @xmath108 '' .",
    "we need this continuation to result in a real @xmath2 matrix , so that we obtain a real non - split @xmath2 matrix for @xmath4 .",
    "starting from this can be done in three inequivalent ways : if we analytically continue @xmath109 we are forced to choose @xmath110 , if we continue @xmath111 we are forced to choose @xmath112 , and finally if we continue @xmath113 we also need @xmath114 . up to inconsequential signs and reshuffling of indices within the timelike and spacelike sets ,",
    "this gives precisely the three @xmath2 matrices and nothing more .",
    "while it seems unlikely there are further inequivalent non - split @xmath2 matrices , we have not proven that this procedure is exhaustive .",
    "for the @xmath2 matrix @xmath115 we use the parametrisation of the @xmath116 coset of @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 with isometric coordinates @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and non - isometric coordinates @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath124 as observed in @xcite , for the @xmath2 matrices @xmath125 and @xmath126 this choice of parametrisation leads to a non - diagonal metric .",
    "here we instead use the coset parametrisations is obtained from the original by permuting indices @xmath26 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath29 , matching the relation between the @xmath2 matrices . regarding @xmath129 we first note that the corresponding permutation , i.e. exchanging @xmath26 with @xmath130 and @xmath128 with @xmath131 in @xmath132 , does not provide a good representation of the coset . however , using the gauge and global symmetry we can find an alternative form of @xmath132 @xmath133 such that the permutation does give a good representation . ]",
    "@xmath134 which directly lead to diagonal metrics .",
    "here we have labelled the coordinates as before , however the non - isometric coordinates are now both non - compact @xmath135    for the @xmath2 matrix @xmath115 the resulting metric and @xmath12-field are given by @xmath136 while for @xmath125 they take the form @xmath137 and finally for @xmath126 we find @xmath138    for the allowed ranges of @xmath122 and @xmath123 given in and the three metrics in , and all have signature @xmath139 .",
    "however , each describes a certain number of disconnected regions separated by curvature singularities .",
    "these regions can be classified by whether @xmath119 is a timelike or spacelike isometry and whether the ns - ns flux @xmath140 is electric or magnetic :    * the metric has two coordinate singularities , one at @xmath141 and one at @xmath142 . therefore , the space - time is split into two regions as shown in figure [ fig0 ] . *",
    "the metric has two coordinate singularities , one at @xmath143 and one at @xmath142 or @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the space - time is again split into two regions as shown in figure [ fig1 ] . *",
    "the metric has only one coordinate singularity at @xmath142 or @xmath144 and hence there is only a single region as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
