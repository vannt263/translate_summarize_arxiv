    "the dynamics of electrons in ordered semiconductor superlattices driven by electric fields has received a great deal of attention .",

    "xp1 furthermore , behavior such as negative differential conductance , on fractional wannier - stark ladders , fws excitonic franz - keldysh effect , fke among others , have been the focus of recent work .",
    "of particular recent interest are the localization and delocalization behavior of electrons in the presence of external electric fields , which have direct effect on the macroscopic transport properties of the system .",
    "for example , in a system with both ac and dc fields , an appropriate ac field will delocalize the wannier - stark ladder states induced by a strong pure dc field .",
    "ol an intense ac field can by itself also lead to _ dynamical localization _ of the carriers .",

    "it is widely known that localization due to disorder plays a fundamental role in a variety of physical situations .",

    "the role of structural correlations in the sequence disorder in dna molecules has also been studied recently , @xcite as this represents a real system that exhibits structural correlations between the diagonal and off - diagonal elements in a tight - binding representation .    in this rich context , it is important to study the competition between dynamic localization ( due to ac field ) , anderson localization ( due to disorder ) and the correlation in the disorder , and to investigate the role of external fields on the transition from the localized to the delocalized state in 1d systems . in this paper , we concentrate on the short range correlations of the random dimer model , and study the localization - delocalization transition driven by external ac electric fields .",
    "we find that ac electric fields induce a transition from extended to localized states under suitable conditions , and find the transition point analytically in the high frequency limit .",

    "the schrdinger equation i ( x , t)=h ( x , t ) can then be written as    i c_n(t)=(_n- ) c_n(t)+ r(c_n+1+c_n-1 ) + ned e_1 ( t ) c_n . [ 4 ] since the term containing the electric field is proportional to @xmath12 , it is not suitable to perform perturbative calculations .",

    "these equations ( [ these ] ) can be further simplified , and in conjunction with ( [ 10 ] ) , we find that ( b_n+1-b_n-1 ) ( 1- ( ) ^2 ) = ( a^0_n+1+a^0_n-1 ) + + ( ) ^2 ( b_n+3-b_n-3)-(a^0_n+3+a^0_n-3 ) ,    where we have defined @xmath29 .",
    "thus the higher fourier component corrections to the effective bandwidth @xmath30 are of higher order in @xmath31 , which of course makes them small in the high frequency limit , @xmath32 . in this limit , the model with ac field behaves essentially as a system _ without _ electric field , except for a rescaling of the bandwidth given to the lowest order by @xmath33 .    in the random dimer model without ac field ,",
    "the localization - delocalization transition occurs when @xmath34 is twice the bandwidth .",
    "dunlap we then intuitively expect that @xmath35 would be the transition point between localized and delocalized states in the presence of the ac field . before giving numerical evidence for this transition in the full random dimer system",

    "it is instructive to see what happens when only one impurity - dimer is involved in an otherwise periodic 1d chain .",
    "we consider both the cases with and without an ac field for comparison .",
    "let us first consider the scattering effects introduced by a single _ site_-impurity in a chain , in the absence of ac field .",
    "dunlap we let all site energies be @xmath36 , except for site 0 where it is @xmath5 . from the eigenvalue equation ( _ n- ) c_n+r(c_n+1+c_n-1)=0 , we can get the transmission probability |t|^2= , where @xmath37 is the wave vector of the incoming bloch wave , and @xmath38 measures the impurity _ detuning _ , and as such is a measure of the  disorder \" or impurity strength .",
    "one can see that for this one - impurity case , @xmath39 for @xmath40 . in a random multi - impurity system ,",
    "a series of @xmath12 scattering events would naturally lead to @xmath41 , and very small amplitude for the outgoing wave , resulting in localization in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if instead , we assign a pair of sites 0 and 1 with energy @xmath5 to form a single dimer impurity , the transmission probability is dunlap |t|^2=1- . in this",
    "_ one impurity - dimer _ case , @xmath42 , whenever @xmath43 .",
    "this is a sort of resonance effect due to the internal structure of the impurities .",
    "thus , in the presence of the peculiar kind of short - range correlated disorder described by the random dimer model , there are states with unity transmission probability , which clearly have an extended character ( even if they only appear at a single value of the energy ) .",
    "this one impurity - dimer calculation , makes intuitive the appearance of extended states in the random multi - dimer system at peculiar energy values , and captures qualitatively the reason for the unusual behavior of the random dimer model [ ] .",
    "we now turn to explore what happens when an ac electric field is turned on .",
    "et al_. studied the system of an isolated defect driven by strong electric fields .",
    "one2 we will make use of green s functions in terms the floquet formalism .",
    "we consider the resolvent operator as a function of the complex frequency @xmath44 g(z)==g^0(z)+g^0(z)vg(z ) , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath47 is the impurity potential , and @xmath48 . in the representation of wannier states , the green s function is g_jl = g^0_jl+g^0_jjv_jlg_ll . in the high frequency limit , @xmath32 , @xmath49 is one2 g^0_jl= , where @xmath33 , and q= .",
    "the sign is chosen such that @xmath50 falls inside the unit circle .",
    "for an isolated defect with @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the case of different site energy ) , the probability @xmath53 for the defect state ( with energy @xmath54 ) to occupy the @xmath55 site is determined by the residue of @xmath56 .",
    "one finds that one2 p(l)=(- ||)^2|l| .",
    "notice that @xmath53 falls exponentially from the site @xmath26 where the defect is localized , with a characteristic decay length that is reduced for increasing @xmath57 , as one might suspect .",
    "now we consider a one - dimer model , with @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . after some calculation , we find g_ll = g_ll^0+g_l0 ^ 0g_0l+g_l1 ^ 0 g_1l + g_0l= + g_1l= , so that g_ll = aq+a^2 q^2l , where @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 .",
    "defining @xmath62 , for the pole at @xmath63 , we get p(l)~(q_1)^2l , and since @xmath64 , this corresponds to a localized state . for the pole @xmath65 , one gets p(l)~(q_2)^2l .",
    "when @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and this corresponds to a localized state with localization length @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 approaches 1 from above , the localization length diverges , indicating a transition to a delocalized state .",
    "thus the single dimer impurity in an ac field yields the same conclusion as in the high frequency case , and the transition from localized to extended states occurs at the point @xmath70 .",
    "most of our numerical calculations were performed on a chain with 1501 sites .",
    "we solved equation ( [ 4 ] ) with initial condition @xmath71 , and analyze the subsequent development .",
    "the site energies were chosen from a bi - valued distribution , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with probability @xmath74 .",

    "one can see in curve ( a ) that when @xmath88 , the mean - square displacement @xmath89 .",
    "this is known as the _ superdiffusive transport _ regime .",

    "on the other hand , curve ( d ) for @xmath91 shows how the mean square displacement is increasingly bounded ( subdiffusive ) , @xmath92 . further increasing @xmath93 , as shown in curve ( e)(@xmath86 ) results in completely bounded motion @xmath94const .",
    ", as anticipated from the analytical discussion above .",
    "we believe the subdiffusive behavior for @xmath95 is a crossover behavior due to finite size effects , masking the anticipated extended @xmath96 localization transition at @xmath35 .",

    "it is very difficult to go beyond the crossover regime by numerical simulations , as it requires simulations in very large system sizes , with longer equilibration times , requiring longer simulation time to obtain accurate values of the self - averaged quantities in a @xmath106 fashion . scaling studies of this transition would be interesting .    the structure of fig .",
    "1 is similar to that shown in [ ] in the absence of ac fields . for a fixed ac electric field amplitude",
    ", there is a transition from extended to localized state behavior with increasing disorder .",
    "the role of ac electric fields can be seen to effectively decrease the hopping constant , thus contributing to the localization of carriers .",
    "for example , for @xmath107 , in the case _ without _ electric fields , results in extended states ( and diffusive transport ) .",
    "dunlap however , when an ac electric field ( with @xmath108 ) is turned on , the mean squared displacement is suppressed .",
    "this localization - delocalization transition is clearly induced by the ac electric field , as the transition shifts to @xmath109    it is interesting to see the situation for a stronger field @xmath110 , ( the first root of @xmath111 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath112 , and we expect that even for very weak disorder the state will be localized . our results in fig .  2 ( with very small disorder , @xmath113 )",
    "show that this is indeed the case .",
    "this is also in agreement with the fact that even in the limit of @xmath114 , i.e. when there is no disorder , the states are localized when band collapse occurs ( i.e. @xmath112 ) .",
    "ol this is nothing but the well - known dynamical localization .",
    "dy in fig.2 one notices that there are oscillations in the mean square displacement .",
    "this is the manifestation of the time dependence of the electric field in this case of weak disorder .",
    "in fact these oscillations also exist in figs .  1 and 3 , except that they are nearly invisible in those cases because the disorder @xmath115 and the displacements being larger ,  hide \" the oscillations .     for @xmath110 , @xmath116 , in the high frequency regime , @xmath76",
    "the effective hopping constant is @xmath112 , and @xmath117 .",
    "notice even weak disorder results in bounded displacement , characteristic of localization . ]       for varying amounts of disorder in the low frequency regime @xmath119 .",
    "the amplitude of ac electric field is @xmath108 .",
    "the effective hopping constant is @xmath120 .",
    "( a ) @xmath121 shows extended , superdiffusive behavior ; ( b ) @xmath122 shows near localization well below the critical value of @xmath35 for high frequency . ]    in fig .",
    "3 we show the transition from localized to extended state in the low frequency limit .",
    "one can see that the transition point is no longer the same as in the high frequency regime @xmath123 .",
    "for example , for @xmath124 ( curve b ) the state is sub - diffusive , with @xmath125 . as expected , when @xmath126 is small enough , for example @xmath127 ( curve a ) , the state is extended and shows superdiffusive behavior .",
    "these results are of course different from the high frequency limits , since in this regime our previous analysis fails .",
    "furthermore , in the extreme low frequency limit , the system tends to that with a dc field : it is known that localized states have a power - law behavior in dc field , instead of the more typical exponential localization in 1d disordered systems .",
    "dc      to understand more clearly how the ac electric field controls the degree of localization , it is useful to extract information from the floquet states for the system driven by periodic electric fields .",
    "the floquet states @xmath128 can be expanded with respect to the wannier states @xmath129 , u_m(t)=_l=1^n c_l^(m)(t ) _",
    "we calculate the averaged inverse participation ratio @xmath130 , p=^n_l=1^t_0 dt |c^(m)_l ( t)|^4 . if a floquet state is nearly localized at individual wannier states , @xmath130 tends to 1 , while @xmath130 vanishes as @xmath131 if the state is extended ; the larger @xmath130 characterizes a more localized state . in fig .  4",
    ", we show @xmath130 for different values of @xmath132 and dimer concentrations versus electric field strength @xmath133 in the high frequency regime , @xmath134 .",
    "we find sharp peaks at @xmath135 , as this value results in @xmath112 , and thus the effective hopping along the chain vanishes .",
    "we can enhance the degree of localization in the random dimer model by increasing the detuning @xmath115 or the dimer concentration @xmath6 .",
    "for cases ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  4 , @xmath6 is the same ( @xmath136 ) , but @xmath115 changes from 0.16 in ( a ) to 0.07 in ( b ) .",
    "in contrast , for ( b ) and ( c ) , the value @xmath115 is the same , but @xmath137 is smaller in ( c ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath130 is larger overall for the more disordered systems , and although a peak appears always at @xmath138 , decreasing disorder suppresses the peak value and overall amplitude of @xmath130 .",
    "one can also observe that there is a relatively sudden enhancement of @xmath130 for the system in ( a ) for @xmath139 , while for ( b ) and ( c ) this occurs between @xmath140 , and 3.3 . from our previous discussion , we know that the localization - delocalization transition occurs at @xmath123 .",
    "from this formula , we find that the transition point for ( a ) is in fact at @xmath141 , while for ( b ) and ( c ) it occurs for @xmath142 , and 3.33 .",
