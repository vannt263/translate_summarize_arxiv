    "one of the most interesting observations in central heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the suppressed production of hadrons with large transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been attributed to the radiative energy loss of quark and gluon jets , produced from initial hard scattering of incoming nucleons , as they traverse through produced quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that elastic scattering of quark and gluon jets in the qgp also leads to an appreciable loss of their energies @xcite . because of its larger color charge , a gluon jet is expected to lose more energy than quark and antiquark jets . since the ratio of high momentum protons and antiprotons to pions produced from the fragmentation of a gluon jet is much larger than that from a quark jet and there are more gluon than quark jets in proton - proton collisions , a larger gluon than quark energy loss would lead to smaller @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios at high transverse momentum in central heavy ion collisions than in proton - proton collisions at same energy @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios at intermediate transverse momentum where they are enhanced in central heavy ion collisions as a result of quark coalescence or recombination @xcite .",
    "experimentally , data from the star collaboration have indicated , however , that @xmath2 and @xmath4 ratios at high transverse momentum in central au+au collisions @xcite approach those in p+p and d+au collisions @xcite .",
    "this observation implies that the ratio of final quark and gluon jets at high transverse momentum is similar to that of initial ones .",
    "a possible mechanism for reducing the effect due to different quark and gluon jet energy losses in qgp is to allow conversions between quark and gluon jets via both elastic @xmath5 and inelastic @xmath1 scatterings with thermal quarks and gluons in the qgp .",
    "the idea of a quark jet converting to a gluon jet has previously been considered in refs.@xcite for deeply inelastic scattering . in the present paper ,",
    "we study this effect in the lowest - order in qcd .",
    "we find that conversions between quark and gluon jets indeed lead to an increase in the final number of gluon jets in central heavy ion collisions than the case without conversions but the effect is not large enough to explain the experimental observation . to bring the resulting @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios at high transverse momentum to the values observed in p+p collisions at same energy",
    "requires a factor of four or larger in the increase of the net quark to gluon jet conversion rate obtained from the lowest - order qcd .",
    "the conversion rate of a quark jet to a gluon jet or vice versa due to two - body scattering with quarks and gluons in a qgp is given by the collisional width @xmath6[1\\pm f({\\bf p}_4)]\\overline{|{\\cal m}_{12\\to 34}|^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&(2\\pi)^4\\delta^{(4)}(p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] divided by @xmath7 . in the above , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , energies of the jet before and after conversion , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are those of quarks and gluons with degeneracy @xmath12 in the qgp ; @xmath13 is the thermal distribution with @xmath14 and @xmath15 referring to gluons and quarks , respectively ; and @xmath16 is the squared scattering amplitude after averaging over the spins and colors of initial partons and summing over those of final partons and is well - known for both the elastic scattering @xmath0 and the inelastic scattering @xmath1 . to ensure that the quark ( gluon ) jet is converted to a gluon ( quark ) jet in elastic scattering , the gluon ( quark ) in the final state is required to have a larger momentum .",
    "since both elastic and inelastic scattering are dominated by forward - peaked @xmath17 and backward - peaked @xmath18 channel diagrams , the momentum of the converted jet is very close to that of the initial jet . neglecting the effect due to the soft parton in a conversion process",
    "is thus justified .",
    "[ width1 ]    to take into account medium effects , we include the thermal masses @xmath19 @xcite for quarks and gluons in a qgp at temperature @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the qcd coupling constant . with @xmath22 ,",
    "appropriate for energy scales considered here , calculated collisional widths for gluon to quark jet ( upper panels ) and quark to gluon jet ( lower panels ) conversions in a chemically equilibrated qgp are shown in fig.1 for jets of momentum 6 ( left panels ) , 8 ( middle panels ) , and 10 ( right panels ) gev/@xmath23 . because of larger ( about a factor of two ) quark than gluon densities in the chemically equilibrated qgp with thermal quark and gluon masses , contributions from elastic ( dashed lines ) and inelastic ( dotted lines ) scattering to conversion of gluon jets to quark jets are comparable , while inelastic scattering is more important than elastic scattering for quark to gluon jet conversion . adding both contributions leads to a larger total conversion rate for the quark jet than for the gluon jet , particularly at high transverse momentum , as shown by solid lines in fig.1 .",
    "as in our study of heavy quark energy loss @xcite , the momentum degradation of a quark or gluon jet in the qgp depends on its drag coefficient , which is given by averages similar to that for the collisional width , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momenta of the jet before and after a collision , respectively , and the sum is over all scattering processes . since the present study is mainly concerned with conversions between gluon and quark jets in the qgp , we only consider explicitly the contribution of two - body scattering to their energy losses and mimic the effect of the more important radiative energy loss by introducing a phenomenological multiplication factor @xmath27 .    in fig.[drag ]",
    ", we show the gluon and quark drag coefficients @xmath28 due to non - conversion ( upper panels ) and @xmath29 due to conversion ( lower panels ) scatterings as functions of their momentum in a qgp at temperatures @xmath30 mev ( left panels ) or @xmath31 mev ( right panels ) .",
    "it is seen that the drag coefficients due to non - conversion scattering are much larger than those due to conversion scattering .",
    "while the drag coefficient for the gluon jet is about a factor of two large than that for the quark jet in non - conversion scattering , they are similar in conversion scattering . enhancing the calculated drag coefficients due to two - body scattering by a factor @xmath32",
    ", we find that both their values and transverse momentum dependence are consistent with those extracted from the energy loss formula derived in ref.@xcite for radiative energy losses of quark and gluon jets in a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we have also checked that with such enhanced drag coefficients , the observed quenching of high transverse momentum pions at rhic can indeed be described .",
    ".parameters for initial minijet parton distributions given in eq.([jet ] ) at midrapidity from au+au at @xmath33 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ parameters ]    to see the effect of conversions between quark and gluon jets on their energy losses in qgp , we consider central au+au collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath33 gev .",
    "the initial transverse momentum spectra of quark , anti - quark , and gluon jets at mid - rapidity are obtained from multiplying those from pythia for p+p collisions at same energy by the number of binary collisions ( @xmath34 ) in central au+au collisions .",
    "the resulting transverse momentum spectra of initial partonic jets can be parameterized by @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath21 . with transverse momentum @xmath37 in unit of gev/@xmath23 ,",
    "values of the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 in above equation are given in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "for the dynamics of formed qgp , we follow that of ref.@xcite by assuming that it evolves boost invariantly in the longitudinal direction but with an accelerated transverse expansion .",
    "specifically , its volume expands in the proper time @xmath41 according to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the transverse radius with an initial value @xmath44=7 fm , @xmath45=0.6 fm/@xmath23 is the qgp formation time , and @xmath46/fm is the transverse acceleration . starting with an initial temperature @xmath47 mev , time dependence of the temperature is obtained from entropy conservation , leading to the critical temperature @xmath48 mev at proper time @xmath49 fm/@xmath23 .    for a quark or gluon jet moving through the qgp ,",
    "the rate for the change of its mean transverse momentum @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 in obtaining the last expression of above equation , we have neglected the dispersion of the jet momentum during its propagation and thus assumed that @xmath52 .",
    "this is expected to be a reasonable approximation for high transverse momentum particles .",
    "because of conversion scatterings , a quark or gluon jet can be converted to a gluon or quark jet with a rate given by corresponding collisional width .",
    "these effects are modeled by introducing a large number of test quark and gluon jets that are distributed in the transverse plane according to that of underlying binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "their transverse momentum distribution is taken to be uniform with directions pointed isotropically in the transverse plane . a test jet of a given kind with certain transverse momentum is assigned a probability that is proportional to the corresponding jet momentum spectrum with the proportional constant determined by requiring that the sum of the probabilities for all test jets of this kind is equal to their total number . motions of the jets",
    "are then followed via straight trajectories .",
    "after a small time step @xmath53 , which is usually taken to be 0.1 fm/@xmath23 , a random number @xmath54 is chosen and compared with @xmath55 . if @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath56 , then the jet is converted to a different kind with a reduction of its momentum @xmath37 by @xmath57 but without changing its associated probability . otherwise , the jet loses a momentum @xmath58 .",
    "this sequence of processes is repeated until the smaller of the time when the qgp phase ends and the time for the jet to escape the expanding qgp .",
    "the final momentum distributions of quark and gluon jets are obtained from those of test jets by multiplying with their associated probabilities .",
    "the ratio of final quark or gluon jet spectrum to its initial spectrum , defined as its nuclear modification factor @xmath59 , is shown in fig.[raa ] .",
    "upper and lower dash - dotted lines are those for the quark and gluon jets using drag coefficients from two - body elastic scattering that are enhanced by the factor @xmath32 but without jet conversions .",
    "the smaller @xmath59 for gluons than for quarks is a result of their larger energy loss .",
    "although final high transverse momentum quark and gluon jets are initially produced near the surface of the qgp fireball , quark jets tend to originate from a region that is deeper inside the fireball than that for gluon jets as a result of their smaller drag coefficients . with the larger quark to gluon conversion width than that for gluon to quark conversion , it is thus more likely for quark jets to convert to gluon jets than for gluon jets to convert to quark jets . including conversions between quark and gluon jets through conversion scatterings",
    "thus reduces the difference between the quark and gluon @xmath59 as shown by dotted lines in fig.[raa ] .    to obtain the proton , antiproton and pion spectra at high transverse momentum from those of quark and gluon jets",
    ", we use the akk fragmentation function @xcite , which has been shown to reproduce measured charged pion , proton , and antiproton spectra at high transverse momentum in p+p and d+au collisions at @xmath60 gev . in particular , the resulting @xmath61 ratio at high transverse momentum in p+p collisions is about 0.7 and agrees with the observed value .",
    "while protons and antiprotons are equally produced from gluon fragmentation , fragmentation of quark and antiquark jets is known to produce mainly protons and antiprotons , respectively @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that no antiprotons are produced from a quark jet and no protons are produced from an antiquark jet as in ref.@xcite .",
    "results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios in central au+au collisions at @xmath33 gev are shown in the left and right panels fig.[ratio ] , respectively .",
    "dash - dotted lines are for the case without conversions between quark and gluon jets , and they are significantly smaller than those in p+p collisions shown by dash - dot - dotted lines .",
    "including conversions between quark and gluon jets increases @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios , as shown by dotted lines , but are still below those from p+p collisions .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios are increased or the difference between the quark and gluon @xmath59 is reduced if the conversion widths shown in fig.1 are enhanced by a factor @xmath62 . as shown in figs .",
    "[ raa ] and [ ratio ] , with @xmath63 ( dashed lines ) , similar to the enhancement factor @xmath27 for quark and gluon drag coefficients , and larger , e.g. , @xmath64 ( solid lines ) , the quark and gluon nuclear modification factors become closer and final @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios are also more similar to those in p+p collisions .",
    "we note that quark and gluon jet conversions have a larger effect on the @xmath3 ratio than the @xmath2 ratio .",
    "this is due to the smaller number of antiquark jets than quark jets in heavy ion collisions and the assumption that quark and antiquark jets fragment only to protons and antiprotons , respectively .",
    "including some admixture of proton and antiproton production from quark jets as well as from antiquark jets would reduce the difference in the jet conversion effect on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios .    as to the effect of using different fragmentation functions , we do not expect them to change our conclusions .",
    "for example , if we use instead the kkp fragmentation function @xcite , which describes the pion spectrum well but underestimates the proton and antiproton spectra at high transverse momentum by about a factor of three , jet conversions are still needed to obtain same @xmath2 and @xmath4 ratios in both cental au+au collisions and p+p collisions at same energy .",
    "of course , their values are about a factor of three smaller than measured ones .",
    "we have studied the effect of both elastic and inelastic two - body scatterings of quark and gluon jets in a quark - gluon plasma not only on their energy loss but also on the conversions between them .",
    "although inelastic two - body scatterings of quark - antiquark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion always lead to conversions between quark and gluon jets , elastic two - body scatterings can be non - conversion scatterings if the momentum of the quark or gluon jet remains to be the one with a larger transverse momentum after the scattering . to mimic the effect of radiative energy loss of quark and gluon jets in the quark - gluon plasma",
    ", we have multiplied the drag coefficients calculated from two - body scattering by a factor of four .",
    "we have found that two - body conversion scatterings lead to a small net conversion of the quark jets to the gluon jets , resulting in slightly larger @xmath2 and @xmath65 ratios than in the case without including conversions between gluon and quark jets but not large enough to bring these ratios in central au+au collisions to those in p+p collisions at same energy . a large conversion enhancement factor of more than four , similar to that needed for the jet drag coefficients to describe the jet energy loss ,",
    "is needed to explain the experimental observations .",
    "we note that somewhat smaller enhancement factors would be needed if the time for starting the interactions of initial jets with the qgp is earlier , such as the formation time @xmath66 of the jets , instead of 0.5 fm/@xmath23 used in present study .",
    "for example , with a starting time of @xmath67 fm / c reduces the enhancement factors by about 20% .    in our study",
    ", we have assumed that the qgp produced at rhic is in chemical equilibrium with about twice many quarks and antiquarks than gluons .",
    "if the produced partonic matter is a pure gluon matter , resulting @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios in central au+au collisions turn out to be slightly smaller than those from a chemically equilibrated qgp as the gluon matter enhances the conversion of gluon jets to quark jets via the inelastic scattering @xmath68 . on the other hand ,",
    "a pure quark and antiquark matter gives slightly larger @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios than from a chemically equilibrated qgp as the rate for the inelastic conversion process @xmath69 is enhanced .",
    "as for a chemically equilibrated qgp , none of these two scenarios is able to increase the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios at high transverse momentum in central au+au collisions to approach those in p+p collisions at same energy without requiring a large enhancement factor for the net quark to gluon jet conversion rate .",
    "our results that the net quark to gluon jet conversion rate in central heavy ion collisions at rhic is much larger than that given by the lowest - order in qcd may not be surprising as the jet drag coefficients from the lowest - order qcd need to be enhanced by a similar factor to describe their energy losses in qgp .",
    "also , previous studies using the multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model @xcite , that includes only two - body scattering among partons , have shown that a much larger parton scattering cross section than that given by the lowest - order qcd is needed to describe many other experimental observations at rhic such as the the large elliptic flows of hadrons made of light quarks @xcite or heavy quarks @xcite and the two - pion correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the large enhancement factor over the lowest - order qcd results can be considered as an effective parameter for taking into account effects not considered in present study such as higher - order contributions and multi - body scattering .",
    "a preliminary study of jet conversions via higher - order radiative scatterings with thermal partons shows that they lead to similar quark and gluon jet conversion widths as the lowest - order two - body scatterings considered in present study .",
    "also , using the qcd coupling constant at finite temperature as extracted from the lattice qcd studies @xcite , which is about a factor of two larger than that from the perturbative qcd , further increases the quark and gluon jet conversion widths , resulting in a conversion enhancement factor close to the needed one .",
    "our results thus could be another indication for the strongly coupled qgp that has been produced in central heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite .",
