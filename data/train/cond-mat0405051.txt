    "furthermore , hydrodynamic interactions give rise to interesting collective behavior , e.g. , periodic or almost periodic motions in time @xcite or even transient chaotic dynamics in the sedimentation of particles @xcite . and they lead to pattern formation of rotating motors @xcite with a possible 2d melting transition of biological motors like atp - synthase embedded in a membrane @xcite .",

    "in particular , we identify a limit cycle which is governed by drafting of particle doublets .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in",
    ", we first define our model system of particles moving in a ring - like trap and summarize the basic equations for the description of the dynamics .",
    "the stability of regular @xmath0-particle clusters in the ring is investigated in by means of a linear stability analysis . then describes the nonlinear dynamics of perturbed clusters .",
    "we introduce the periodic limit cycle of the three - particle system and perform a harmonic analysis .",
    "the influence of the trap strength on the dynamics is discussed .",
    "furthermore , we briefly address the dynamics in fairly weak traps .",
    "finally , in , we present the particle velocities as a function of ring radius and particle number .",
    "we consider non - brownian , equal - sized spherical particles suspended in a viscous fluid in the regime of low reynolds numbers whose mutual interactions are solely of hydrodynamic origin .",
    "we mimick the basic features of particles captured in an optical vortex by applying a constant tangential force @xmath1 to each particle and by keeping the particles on a ring of radius @xmath2 by means of a harmonic radial trap with force constant @xmath3 ( ) . the particle motion is effectively two - dimensional in the plane of the ring ( @xmath4 ) ; thus , the particle positions are best described by polar coordinates , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . with the radial and tangential unit vectors at the position of particle @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the total external force acting on particle",
