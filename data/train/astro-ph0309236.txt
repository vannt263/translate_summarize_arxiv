    "since the very first attempt of modeling a protoplanet interacting with its primitive nebula by @xcite , two decades have passed .",
    "seventeen years had to go by for tackling this problem with the strength of new and more powerful computational tools @xcite . as a consequence of the mounting interest in extrasolar planets , boosted by eight years of uninterrupted new detections ,",
    "the scientific community has made an extraordinary effort , over the past four years , to analyze disk - planet interactions by means of numerical calculations .    yet ,",
    "regardless of the processes accounted for in the implemented numerical models , limitations and restrictions remain an issue to deal with . as a matter of fact",
    ", numerical calculations still lag behind the present knowledge of the possible physical effects which occur in a circumstellar environment containing massive bodies .",
    "thereupon , simplifying assumptions are always demanded .",
    "nonetheless , steps forward have been made in many directions to reduce their number .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) disks containing jupiter - size objects have been investigated by @xcite and , including also magnetic fields , by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) carried out global two - dimensional ( 2d ) high - resolution simulations of jupiter - mass as well as earth - mass planets , resolving also the flow structure within the planetary s roche lobe by applying a resolution enhancement strategy .",
    "this study has been lately extended to the 3d space by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) and by @xcite , who used instead a single grid with variable step size .",
    "@xcite performed 2d computations , considering the effects due to disk self - gravity . @xcite",
    "have investigated the interactions between a planet and an optically thin disk with local simulations in the shearing sheet approximation , in order to determine the one - sided gravitational torque acting on the planet .    with the present work we intend to relax the widely adopted local - isothermal approximation , i.e. , that of treating a disk as a system having a fixed temperature distribution which depends neither on time nor on any other system variable . yet",
    ", we will preserve the global viewpoint which we believe to be crucial because disk - planet interactions can be highly non - local .",
    "many of the sophisticated accretion disk studies adopt 2d or 1 + 1d schemes due to the difficulty of dealing with all the necessary ingredients in a full 3d space . until very recently , in fact , radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mixtures of gas and dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and chemical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been treated via two - dimensional models .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations generally involve parameter studies , because many physical quantities are poorly known .",
    "thereby , with a restricted number of dimensions , one is at least able to acquire a spectrum of possible approximate solutions .    in order to overcome the local - isothermal hypothesis and to maintain a global approach at the same time",
    ", we introduce an energy transport in 2d ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) models .",
    "we include all the supposedly major causes responsible for generation , transfer , and loss of energy in low - temperature circumstellar disk environments .",
    "we take advantage of the small aspect ratio of the disk , and assume that all the radiation transport is effective only in the vertical direction .",
    "such approximation works reasonably well in accretion disks , away from the boundary and surface layers ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "though such an approach relies on the `` slimness '' assumption , it is as well appropriate in the local environment around a protoplanet .",
    "in fact , around there , the disk becomes even thinner when the planet s gravitational action is accounted for .",
    "hence , the amount of energy transported by radiation in the vertical direction still overwhelms that transported horizontally .",
    "although this represents a simplistic kind of thermal description , it allows to investigate processes which have not been considered thus far , i.e. , the joint thermo - hydrodynamical evolution of disk - planet interactions . furthermore , since these simulations benefit of a nested - grid numerical technique ( paper  i , paper  ii ) , though relying on the global approach we are capable of achieving resolutions large enough to accurately describe the system within the planetary s roche lobe .",

    "henning , & w. kley the outline of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we introduce the physical formulation of the problem , focusing on the equation for the thermal energy density and related issues .",
    "section  [ sec : esolver ] concerns the numerical method utilized to solve the energy equation along with a series of tests . in   [ sec : parameters ] we specify the adopted parameters and other various details . sections  [ sec : global ] and [ sec : pstructure ] describe , respectively , global and local properties of models with different masses and viscosity regimes . in   [ sec : accmig ] we report the results for mass accretion and orbital migration .",
    "our conclusions are presented in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as mentioned before , we are going to tackle the problem of energy transfer in an accretion disk with an embedded planet .",
    "since solving the full set of equations in three dimensions and simultaneously achieving sufficient resolution around the protoplanet is computationally difficult at the moment , we restrict to two - dimensional disk models .",
    "the reason for this choice is two - folded . on the one hand , with affordable computational times and sufficiently high resolutions , it allows to investigate the coupling between hydrodynamics and thermodynamics both in the disk and nearby the embedded body . on the other ,",
    "it permits to adopt a strategic assumption in writing the energy equation , i.e. , that the horizontal energy transport can be neglected compared to the vertical one .",
    "in other words , in a 2d disk one can assume that radiation transport is only effective along the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the system .",
    "hence , let us describe the disk material through the navier - stokes equations for the surface density @xmath11 , the linear momentum ( density ) @xmath12 , and the angular momentum ( density ) @xmath13 , where we choose as working coordinate frame a cylindrical one @xmath14 .",
    "the origin is located at the center of mass of the star and the planet while the disk lies in the plane @xmath15 .",
    "the hydrodynamics equations have been already stated , by using the same notations , in paper  i.    as in most of the computations performed so far , we avoid dealing with the poisson equation and rather assume that the gravitational field is determined only by the star and the planet , neglecting the self - gravity of the disk material .",
    "this is allowed by the circumstance that the toomre @xmath16-parameter is well beyond @xmath8 in all of our models .",
    "@xcite found that some effects indeed arise when disk self - gravity is taken into account .",
    "however , we note that they consider disk masses ten times as large as those considered here .",
    "thereby , we rely on a smoothed point - mass gravitational potential , which well reproduces more realistic protoplanetary gravitational potentials ( paper  ii ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the radius vectors indicating the positions of the star and the planet , respectively .",
    "as done in paper  ii , we set the parameter @xmath20 as a constant length ( see   [ sec : parameters ] for details ) .",
    "the thermal structure of the fluid has been usually fixed through a power law of the distance @xmath9 .",
    "thereupon , the set of equations has been closed by adding an equation of state which connects the local gas ( two - dimensional ) pressure to the surface density by means of a local isothermal sound speed @xmath21 @xmath22 thus , the mach number of the flow is considered constant throughout the system s evolution , constrained solely by the disk aspect ratio @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite did some simulations using a polytropic equation of state of the type @xmath24 .",
    "however , the evolution of the thermal properties of the system have not been generally considered .    in the present calculations we use an ideal equation of state which directly ties the gas pressure @xmath25 to the thermal energy density ( energy per unit area ) @xmath26 @xmath27 where the adiabatic index @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "furthermore , if we suppose that disk material behaves as a perfect gas , then the temperature is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath31 is the hydrogen mass , and @xmath32 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed is given by @xmath33    equation  ( [ eq : es ] ) implicitly assumes that radiation pressure @xmath34 is negligibly small compared to gas pressure .",
    "such hypothesis is connected to the relatively low temperature regimes we deal with ( in fact @xmath35 ) and its validity was checked afterward . in all of the models presented here ,",
    "the ratio @xmath36 never exceeds @xmath37 .      equations for energy transport differ according to the processes that have to be included for a correct description of the energy budget of fluid elements . in our case , we suppose that a parcel of disk fluid can gain or lose thermal energy only because of flow advection , compressional work , viscous dissipation , and dissipative effects due to radiation transport . in this sense , rather than strictly treating the transfer of radiation in the disk , we will account only for the cooling effects that radiation causes .",
    "then , the energy equation takes the following form @xmath38 in equation  ( [ eq : eneq ] ) we indicated with @xmath39 the dissipation function and with @xmath40 the radiated energy . in two dimensions ,",
    "either of these quantities is an energy flux .",
    "both functions are always positive , thereby the former acts as a heating source , whereas the latter as a cooling term . in this study",
    "we do not consider convection because we do not expect it to be a major energy source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we neglect irradiation from the central star which is presumably an effective heating mechanism only in the upper layers of circumstellar disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose effects however are reduced by small disk scale heights .",
    "more importantly , as a consequence of the gap formation and the protoplanet s gravity , circumplanetary material is shielded from stellar radiation , as it will be clarified later .",
    "the function @xmath39 can be directly computed from the components of the viscous stress tensor @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 @xmath44 the divergence term @xmath45 in the equation arises because a three - dimensional definition of stress tensor * * is adopted .",
    "in fact , the reduction from three to two dimensions is merely achieved by setting the vertical component of the flow field @xmath46 and the derivative operator @xmath47 to zero .    in a three - dimensional disk ,",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : eneq ] ) is equal to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the frequency - integrated radiation flux @xmath50 in the above equation @xmath51 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath52 is a frequency - integrated opacity coefficient and @xmath53 is the mass density . as mentioned before , we suppose that the amount of energy transported by radiation in the vertical direction is much larger than that transported horizontally , i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 since the vertical disk structure is not meant to be accounted for , it is possible to equate the pressure scale height to the photospheric scale height and assume that all the radiation is liberated at @xmath56 . thereupon , equation  ( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) becomes @xmath57 in 2d disks it is useful to measure the emitted flux by means of an _ effective temperature _ : @xmath58 , therefore @xmath59 the factor @xmath60 indicates that in a disk radiation escapes from both of its sides .    a simple relation between the midplane temperature and the emergent radiation flux can be found by writing @xmath61 \\nonumber\\\\         & \\approx &                              \\frac{8}{3 }                              \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{r}}}{\\kappa\\,\\rho\\,h }                              \\left[t^4(0)-t^4(h)\\right ] .",

    ", the quantity @xmath66 refers to the disk midplane temperature .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : teff_c ] ) represents a fairly good approximation when the medium is very optically thick , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "this is indeed the case in those regions of unperturbed accretion disks which we simulate , because @xmath11 is large enough . yet , because of the action of massive bodies , in our case deep density gaps form where material is very diluted .",
    "in addition there are zones , where the disk spirals interact with the circumplanetary disk spirals , which can have very low densities ( see paper  i , fig .",
    "12 and 13 ) .",
    "such conditions make equation  ( [ eq : teff_c ] ) not always applicable .",
    "@xcite found a more rigorous relation between the effective and midplane accretion disk temperature , which represents a generalization of the _ gray model _ of classical stellar atmospheres in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",

    "the quantity @xmath70 is equal to the ratio between the rosseland and the planck mean opacities .",
    "this quantity can be also roughly interpreted as the ratio of _ total extinction _",

    ", we set @xmath72 because we checked that we can neglect radiation scattering ( see   [ ssec : tests ] ) .",
    "thus , no distinction is made between the extinction and the absorption coefficients .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) mimics the radiative losses of both optically thick and optically thin media , and therefore is very suitable to our purposes .",

    "since we simulate a distance range where disk material can be relatively cold , dust opacity is crucial for an accurate estimation of radiative losses @xcite . because of this",
    ", bell s opacity includes grain absorption as tabulated by @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of comparison we ran some test cases ( see   [ ssec : tests ] ) with a new opacity coefficient developed by semenov and collaborators ( 2002 , private communication ) and based on the improved grain opacity tables provided by @xcite .",
    "they aimed at coupling gas and dust opacities , focusing on the temperature range proper to protostellar disk environments .    in either case , the midplane temperature @xmath66 and mass density @xmath53 have to be provided in cgs units . in turn",

    ", we assume that @xmath75 in the next section we explain how the disk scale height @xmath74 is calculated in a fashion such to account also for the gravitational influence of the planet .",
    "this guarantees a more refined and consistent modeling of the system .      inside a circumstellar disk",
    "it is natural to assume that material is in hydrostatic equilibrium along the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "let @xmath76 be the gravitational acceleration in the @xmath77-direction within the disk , then the hydrostatic equilibrium reads @xmath78 the factor @xmath60 is necessary because the midplane pressure sustains both sides of the disk .    when the temperature distribution is not coupled to the rest of the dynamical variables , equation  ( [ eq : h1 ] )",
    "is used to obtain the disk pressure from the density and the pressure scale height , assuming that @xmath79 and omitting the planet gravitational attraction .    in the present study",
    ", we compute the pressure directly from the thermodynamical processes occurring in the gas ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : es ] ] ) , thus we can use equation  ( [ eq : h1 ] ) to estimate the disk scale height @xmath74 in a consistent fashion .",
    "this quantity , in fact , is needed to obtain the mass density from the surface density , as explained above .",
    "since the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : h1 ] ) is equal to @xmath80 , we can integrate the right - hand side in order to get an implicit function of @xmath74 .",

    "non - linear effects in wave propagation inevitably lead to shock formation .",
    "this is indeed the case in disk - planet simulations . in ideal fluids shocks",
    "are mathematical discontinuities .",
    "therefore , in finite - differencing schemes , they must extend only over one or two grid points . in order to provide the correct jump conditions , ahead and behind a shock front",
    ", dissipative terms have to be present in the equations .",
    "this is usually done by introducing a non - linear viscous pressure otherwise known as _",
    "artificial viscosity_. since the pressure gradient is no longer proportional to the density gradient , shocks stronger than those observed in local - isothermal computations ( see , e.g. , paper  i ) may develop .",
    "therefore , the physical viscosity might not be sufficient to provide the correct jump conditions across shock fronts .",
    "the most rigorous treatment of shocks in a multidimensional space , with a generic metric tensor , requires the definition of an isotropic viscous stress tensor * * @xcite , which can be written as @xmath97 , \\label{eq : q}\\ ] ] being * * the unit tensor .",

    "this is usually fixed to the maximum grid spacing .",
    "the coefficient @xmath100 is positive only for compression and zero for expansion , so the artificial viscosity is large in shocks and negligibly small elsewhere .",
    "since the artificial viscous tensor acts as a pseudo - pressure , it affects both momentum and energy equations through the terms @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( meant as a tensor product ) , respectively .",
    "the aforementioned equations are updated , by using the correct components @xmath103 , as explained in @xcite .",

    "the general numerical method employed to solve the hydrodynamical equations on a hierarchy of nested grids , applied to simulations of disk - planet interactions , has been explained in paper  i. in contrast to previous calculations , thermal energy density @xmath26 now appears as an independent variable .",
    "here we outline how the source terms ( right - hand side of eq .  [",
    "[ eq : eneq ] ] ) are dealt with . in the framework of the nested - grid scheme ,",
    "whenever required , @xmath26 is interpolated from a finer to a coarser grid and _ vice versa _ , according to the procedures outlined in paper  i(see also paper",
    "the energy equation ( eq .  [ [ eq : eneq ] ] ) is solved by means of a multi - step operator splitting method .",
    "the first step takes care of the energy advection and this is done in the same fashion as the advection of the other dynamical quantities , i.e. , through the van leer s algorithm . viscous dissipation and radiative cooling",
    "are treated by means of a predictor - corrector scheme , which is second - order accurate in time , where heating and cooling terms are considered simultaneously for better accuracy and stability .    during the course of the first experiments , it was discovered that , due to very high pressures and large values of the flow divergence ( in the wake of the circumplanetary spirals ) the compressional work could lower the thermal energy by a large amount . consequently , the predictor - corrector procedure applied to this equation term occasionally occurred to be unstable , producing negative energy values .",
    "therefore we decided to take advantage of equation  ( [ eq : es ] ) and use an analytic solution for updating the energy .    in the framework of the operator - splitting approach , in order to correct the energy because of the gas compression / dilation , we have to solve numerically the equation @xmath105 with the aid of the state equation , this becomes @xmath106 equation  ( [ eq : step1 ] ) has an analytic solution , given by @xmath107}$ ] , where @xmath108 is a time interval over which the divergence @xmath45 has not appreciably changed .",

    "it is easy to prove that equation  ( [ eq : pceqiv ] ) is equivalent to a predictor - corrector scheme .",
    "the above equation also shows that the second - order correction always increase the thermal energy .",
    "although the procedure in equation  ( [ eq : compup ] ) is not so general as the predictor - corrector algorithm , it is more accurate and unconditionally stable . furthermore , contrary to what may seem at first glace , from the computational viewpoint it is faster than the other because it requires less mathematical operations .",
    "we have tested the equation energy solver from both the numerical and the physical point of view . here",
    "we present some of these tests .",
    "the first test is intended to check whether the equation of energy furnishes physically consistent results by comparing the computed temperature to that derived from some analytical solutions of equation  ( [ eq : eneq ] ) .",
    "if we deal with a stationary keplerian disk then the energy budget simplifies enormously .",
    "in fact , in a pure keplerian flow both energy advection and compressional work are negligibly small .",

    "if we additionally assume that the disk is optically thick then the emitted flux can be approximated to @xmath118 as implied by equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) , when @xmath67 .",

    "figure  [ f : mtest ] ( right panel ) shows how the calculated averaged temperature @xmath135 ( crosses ) fits to this analytic estimation .    for the sake of completeness",

    "although not reported here , we also tested the complete algorithm against convergence stability , i.e. , we checked that it always converges to the same solution whatever the initial conditions are .",
    "two simulations were set up in which the full form of equation  ( [ eq : eneq ] ) is solved along with equation  ( [ eq : upsilon ] ) , equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) , and the bell s opacity coefficient (   [ ssec : opacity ] ) .",

    "finally , we examine some implications related to the opacity tables .",
    "a simulation was performed with the same parameterization as the `` hot '' model mentioned above . but instead of choosing bell s opacity , this model is based on the new tables by semenov and collaborators ( 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the resulting surface density distribution , at equilibrium , is hardly distinguishable from that obtained with the `` hot '' model .",
    "furthermore , not much difference is measured between the stationary averaged temperature profiles , as demonstrated in figure  [ f : dbtest ] .",
    "the result is not surprising , since already @xcite tested the influence of different opacity tables on the vertical structure of accretion disks and found that the change in disk structure , due to an improved opacity coefficient , is hardly perceivable when compared to the uncertainties connected with the general disk parameterization .",
    "hence , throughout these simulations we use the opacity coefficient by @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to note that this opacity table is well tested and has been extensively adopted in accretion disk studies godon1996,bell1997,klahr1999,armitage1999,papa1999,nomura2002 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) contains the quantity @xmath70 which can be interpreted as the ratio of extinction to the absorption coefficient .",

    "the resulting temperature profile is hardly distinguishable from the thick line in figure  [ f : dbtest ] .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis @xmath146 is quite correct in our applications .",

    "disk spirals are probably too elusive to be captured by present - day ground - based instruments , as shown by the flux maps .",

    "the quantity @xmath131 is very similar to that illustrated in left panel of figure  [ f : gst ] ( long - dashed line ) whereas @xmath217 is only slightly different ( near the inner border ) from the one in the right panel of the same figure .",
    "some more important deviations from what has been seen thus far are instead encountered in the a3-model , as displayed in figure  [ f : a3 ] .",
    "the averaged surface density shows a significant hump ( top - left panel , solid line ) , inside the gap region , not observed in the other viscosity regimes .",
    "this is not caused by the mass accumulation around the planet but it is produced by material lingering around lagrangian points l4 and l5 , as it appears from the ring - like traces in the middle of the density gap in the top - right panel figure  [ f : a3 ] .",
    "this also appear to be a persistent feature , in fact no change is measured over the last 50 orbital periods .",
    "l4 and l5 points are equilibrium locations for the restricted three - body problem .",
    "hence , one can expect that the thermal energy is larger near such points than anywhere else in the gap . in turn ,",
    "viscous torques , which are enhanced by the locally increased kinematic viscosity are more efficient in contrasting gravitational torques . thereby , material is more likely forced to evolve on the much longer viscous time scale @xmath218 .    as for the temperature ( fig .",

    "[ f : gsh ] ) .",

    "[ tb : gaps ] we report the gap occurrence and depth for some of the models .",
    "one reason why the above criterion could not properly apply to our calculations lies in the fact that it was derived for simple polytropic disks , while we simulate also the thermal evolution of the system .",
    "as implied by the profiles in the top - left panel of figure  [ f : a3 ] , it is even harder to predict the gap presence when the kinematic viscosity depends on the local fluid temperature .",

    "it should be noted that only the model a3 presents optically thin regions toward the edges of the sub - disk .",
    "accreted matter also contributes to the energy budget of the circumplanetary disk via dissipation of gravitational energy into heat .",
    "this source of energy is not treated explicitly in these simulations .",
    "however , it is considered implicitly as a compression work term arising from the removal of matter in the accreting region .",
    "@xcite assumed the dissipation of gravitational energy as the only heating source and derived temperature profiles of sub - disks with different sound - speed regimes , performing local simulations with an isothermal equation of state .",
    "they found that the temperature would scale as @xmath342 , independently of the planetary mass .",
    "we have to point out that , since radial transport of radiation is not treated here , one should expect large temperature gradients to be smoothed out .",
    "but we have seen that temperature profiles are not extremely steep , in the range of distances covered by these models , hence correction by radial transfer should not be dramatically relevant , as we are going to demonstrate .",
    "since the temperature gradient in the vicinity of a protoplanet may be quite steep , one of the hypothesis used in   [ ssec : energyeq ] might locally break down .",
    "we refer to the assumption that the radiative flux in the vertical direction overwhelms those in the horizontal direction . with a semi - analytical analysis it is possible to make an _ a posteriori _ check of that hypothesis and",
    "shed some light over this matter . for simplicity",
    "we will suppose that the temperature distribution has a cylindrical symmetry around the planet , which is indeed what is observed in all of the models .",
    "hence the total flux of energy transferred via radiation is @xmath343\\ ,            { \\mathrm{d}}z        = \\lambda_z + \\lambda_{{s } } , \\label{eq : lambda2d}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the distance from the planet .",
    "the two terms on the right - hand side can be written as @xmath344 and @xmath345 equation  ( [ eq : lambda_z ] ) was obtained by setting @xmath346 in equation  ( [ eq : lambda2d ] ) , whereas equation  ( [ eq : lambda_s ] ) was derived by adopting equation  ( [ eq : syntt ] ) , which we have checked to hold as long as @xmath347 .",
    "the validity of the relation  ( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) , namely that @xmath348 , depends on the ratio of the left - hand sides of equations  ( [ eq : lambda_z ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda_s ] ) : @xmath349    according to equation  ( [ eq : lratio0 ] ) , only when @xmath350 the radiative cooling ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : lambda ] ] ) included in the energy equation is also locally a good approximation . as shown in figure  [ f : avhs ] , this seems indeed to be the case in models involving jupiter - size planets . to cast the above ratio in a more explicit form",
    ", one can use the expression for @xmath74 ( eq .  [ [ eq : h ] ] ) in the limit @xmath90 , which yields @xmath351 by using the form of the sound speed in equation  ( [ eq : cs ] ) , one gets @xmath352 therefore , because of the assumption made above on the temperature profile , equation  ( [ eq : lratio0 ] ) becomes @xmath353 since the distance @xmath96 is constrained by the applicability range of equation  ( [ eq : syntt ] ) , the ratio given by equation  ( [ eq : lratio ] ) is supposedly meaningful roughly for @xmath354 $ ] , for the models considered here . with the appropriate values ,",
    "the ratio  ( [ eq : lratio ] ) becomes @xmath355 equation  ( [ eq : lratiosim ] ) is an evaluation of equation  ( [ eq : lratio ] ) at a distance @xmath96 from the planet , whose length shortens as @xmath356 .",
    "since the squared sub - disk aspect ratio grows as @xmath357 , the flux ratio goes as @xmath358 . from table",
    "[ tb : synttav ] , we see that @xmath359 is between @xmath360 and @xmath361 in c - models and between @xmath362 and @xmath363 in h - models . therefore , the right - most term in equation  ( [ eq : lratiosim ] ) can be considered as a unity term .",
    "thus , around @xmath364 , @xmath365 for the jupiter - mass h - model and a factor two as small for the c - model .",
    "similar small numbers are obtained from both the a2 and a3 model . for @xmath366 ,",
    "the ratio increases , respectively , to @xmath367 and @xmath368 , which is consistent with the applicability limit of the two - dimensional approximation .",
    "thereby , apart from regions closer than @xmath369 to the accreting planet which , probably , can not be properly investigated by these computations , radiation transport in the radial direction does not play a major role in the energy budget of circumplanetary disk material .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard scenario of the late stages of protojovian disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accreting models assume that the planetary accretion rate can adjust to the rate at which matter can be supplied by the surrounding environment .",
    "we now investigate the opposite situation , namely when no further accretion onto the protoplanet is allowed .",
    "the overall flow structure and density distribution of non - accreting protoplanets are drastically different from those of accreting ones .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure  [ f : zpic3 ] , where we show the surface density and the flow field for @xmath164 ( upper panels ) and @xmath241 ( lower panels ) objects .",
    "the standard scenario of a keplerian - like sub - disk is completely altered . this is a consequence of the large pressure gradient , built up by the large density gradient , which allows matter to move on orbits not constrained by the centrifugal balance .",
    "therefore , the two - arm spiral feature is replaced by a more complex system of multiple shock fronts across which material is first deflected toward the planet and then ejected outward , as also indicated by the sign of the in - fall velocity @xmath279 within the region .",
    "the flow strongly diverges in a zone that has a radius equal to @xmath370 in the upper - left panel ( h - jupiter model ) and to @xmath371 in the upper - right panel ( c - jupiter model ) .",
    "the average surface density inside of @xmath372 is between one and two and a half orders of magnitude larger than that measured in accreting models .",
    "the mass collected in @xmath373 is @xmath374 and @xmath375 for the jupiter - mass h - model and the c - model , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal average of the circumplanetary density , around jupiter - size objects , can be approximated to @xmath376 ( h - model ) and to @xmath377 ( c - model ) .",

    "a major difference can be also observed in the sub - disk circulation of low - mass models ( fig .",
    "[ f : zpic3 ] , lower panels ) . in fact",
    ", the fluid rotates in a clockwise direction . in general , the direction of rotation in sub - disks is determined by the balance among the coriolis force , the pressure gradient , and the gravitational attraction by the planet .",
    "basically , referring to the lower - right panel of figure  [ f : zpic3 ] , the coriolis force deflects fluid elements , orbiting at @xmath378 , rightward .",
    "therefore , it forces matter to cross the gap and to reconnect to the other side , while still moving in a position upstream of the perturber body . in contrast , the term @xmath379 , supposedly positive , opposes to reconnection when fluid is upstream of the planet s location but favors it when matter is downstream of the planet .",
    "the prograde rotation that has been encountered so far indicates that the coriolis deflection overwhelms the pressure gradient .",
    "for this reason reconnection across the gap always occurs upstream of the planet . evidently , in the low - mass models ( @xmath163 ) displayed in the bottom panels of figure  [",
    "f : zpic3 ] , the pressure gradient drives material , flowing from upstream , past the planet s position and forces it to circulate clockwise around the perturber .",
    "consequently , matter entering the hill sphere has an angular momentum anti - parallel ( in the planet s frame ) to that of the circumstellar disk . in the range from @xmath0 to @xmath380 ,",
    "the magnitude of the rotational velocity @xmath381 increases roughly as @xmath382 .",

    "<S> with a series of numerical simulations , we analyze the thermo - hydrodynamical evolution of circumstellar disks containing jupiter - size protoplanets . in the framework of the two - dimensional approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an energy equation that includes viscous heating and radiative effects in a simplified , yet consistent form . </S>",
    "<S> multiple nested grids are used in order to study both global and local features around the planet . by means of different viscosity prescriptions , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate various temperature regimes . a planetary mass range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is examined . </S>",
    "<S> computations show that gap formation is a general property which affects density , pressure , temperature , optical thickness , and radiated flux distributions . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains a prominent feature only when the kinematic viscosity is on the order of @xmath2 or lower , though it becomes rather shallow for @xmath3 perturbers . around accreting planets , a circumplanetary disk forms that has a surface density profile decaying exponentially with the distance and </S>",
    "<S> whose mass is @xmath4@xmath5 orders of magnitudes smaller than jupiter s mass . </S>",
    "<S> circumplanetary disk temperature profiles decline roughly as the inverse of the distance from the planet , matching the values measured in the gap toward the border of the roche lobe . </S>",
    "<S> temperatures range from some @xmath6 to @xmath7 . moreover , circumplanetary disks are generally opaque , with optical thickness larger than @xmath8 and aspect ratios around a few tenths . </S>",
    "<S> non - accreting protoplanets provide quite different scenarios , with a clockwise , i.e. , reversed flow rotation around low - mass bodies . planetary accretion and </S>",
    "<S> migration rates depend on the viscosity regime , with discrepancies within an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> coorbital torques increase as viscosity increases . </S>",
    "<S> for high viscosities , type  i migration may extend to larger planetary masses . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of growth and migration time scales inferred by these models are on the same orders of magnitude as those previously obtained with locally isothermal simulations , both in two and three dimensions . </S>"
