    "t - splines @xcite have been introduced as a free - form geometric technology and were the first tool of interest in adaptive isogeometric analysis ( iga ) .",
    "although they are still among the most common techniques in computer aided design , t - splines provide algorithmic difficulties that have motivated a wide range of alternative approaches to mesh - adaptive splines , such as hierarchical b - splines @xcite , thb - splines @xcite , lr splines @xcite , hierarchical t - splines @xcite , amongst many others .    one major difficulty using t - splines for analysis has been pointed out by buffa , cho and sangalli @xcite , who showed that general t - spline meshes can induce linear dependent t - spline blending functions .",
    "this prohibits the use of t - splines as a basis for analytical purposes such as solving a discretized partial differential equation .",
    "this insight motivated the research on t - meshes that guarantee the linear independence of the corresponding t - spline blending functions , referred to as _ analysis - suitable t - meshes_. analysis - suitability has been characterized in terms of topological mesh properties @xcite and , in an alternative approach , through the equivalent concept of dual - compatibility @xcite . while dual - compatibility has been characterized in arbitrary dimensions @xcite , analysis - suitability as a topological criterion for linear independence of the t - spline functions is only available in the two - dimensional setting .    in this paper , we introduce analysis - suitable t - splines for those 3d meshes that are refinements of tensor - product meshes , and propose an algorithm for their local refinement , based on our preliminary work in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we generalize the algorithm from @xcite by introducing a grading parameter @xmath0 that represents the number of children in a single elements refinement .",
    "this allows the user to fully control how local the refinement shall be .",
    "choosing @xmath0 large yields meshes with very local refinement , while a small @xmath0 will cause more wide - spreaded refinement .",
    "the former yields a smaller number of degrees of freedom , while the latter reduces the overlap of the basis functions and hence provides sparser galerkin and collocation matrices .    this paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : refinement ] defines the initial mesh and basic refinement steps and introduces our new refinement algorithm . section  [ sec : adm meshes ] then characterizes the class of ` admissible meshes ' generated by this algorithm . in section  [ sec : tspline def ] we give a brief definition of trivariate odd - degree t - splines . in section",
    "[ sec : as ] we give an abstract definition of analysis - suitability in the 3d setting and prove that all admissible meshes are analysis - suitable . in section  [ sec : dc ]",
    "we define dual - compatible meshes , and prove that analysis - suitability and dual - compatibility are equivalent , and that all dual - compatible meshes provide linear independent t - spline functions .",
    "( figure  [ fig : overview ] illustrates this `` long way '' to linear independence . ) section  [ sec : complexity ] proves linear complexity of the refinement procedure , and conclusions and an outlook to future work are finally given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "let @xmath1 be a dc t - mesh .",
    "then the set of functionals @xmath2 is a set of dual functionals for the set @xmath3 .",
    "the proof below follows the ideas of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.1 ) and ( * ? ? ? * proposition  7.3 ) .",
    "let @xmath4 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath5 with @xmath6 representing the kronecker symbol .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are disjoint ( or have an intersection of empty interior ) , then at least one of the pairs @xmath9 has an intersection with empty interior .",
    "assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that @xmath10 , then @xmath11 assume that @xmath7 and @xmath8 have an intersection with nonempty interior .",
    "since the mesh @xmath1 is dc , the two nodes overlap in at least two dimensions . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume the index vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 overlap .",
    "proposition  [ prp : overlap ] yields @xmath14 the above identities immediately prove if @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "if on the contrary , @xmath17 and @xmath16 , then @xmath18 and @xmath19 are aligned in @xmath20-direction , this is , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are both vectors of @xmath23 consecutive indices from the same index set @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath18 and @xmath19 must overlap also in @xmath20-direction .",
    "again , proposition  [ prp : overlap ] yields @xmath25 which concludes the proof .",
    "let @xmath1 be a dc t - mesh .",
    "then the set @xmath3 is linear independent .",

    "this section is devoted to a complexity estimate in the style of a famous estimate for the newest vertex bisection on triangular meshes given by binev , dahmen and devore @xcite and , in an alternative version , by stevenson  @xcite .",
    "linear complexity of the refinement procedure is an inevitable criterion for optimal convergence rates in the adaptive finite element method ( see e.g.  @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "we have generalized the concept of analysis - suitability to three - dimensional meshes that originate from tensor - product initial meshes , and proved that it guarantees linear independence of the t - spline blending functions .",
    "we introduced a local refinement algorithm with adjustable mesh grading , and proved that it has linear complexity in the sense that the overhead for preserving analysis - suitability is essentially bounded by the number of marked elements .",
    "we expect that these results also generalize to even - degree and mixed - degree t - splines . in order to achieve this ,",
    "a universal definition of anchor elements is needed , based on the techniques from @xcite .",
    "open questions that have not been investigated in this paper address the overlay ( this is , the coarsest common refinement of two meshes ) , the nesting behavior of the t - spline spaces , and more general meshes . as in our preliminary work @xcite , we expect that the overlay has a bounded cardinality in terms of the two overlaid meshes , and that it is also an admissible mesh .",
    "nestedness of t - spline spaces is not evident in general @xcite , but we expect nestedness for the meshes generated by the proposed refinement algorithm .",
    "a first step in this issue will be a characterization of three - dimensional meshes that induce nested t - spline spaces .",
    "a generalization of this paper to a more general class of meshes will most likely require a manifold representation of the mesh , and use recent results on dual - compatibility in spline manifolds @xcite .",
