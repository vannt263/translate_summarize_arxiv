    "statistical properties of time intervals between successive earthquakes , henceforward the interoccurrence times and the recurrence times , have been frequently studied in order to predict when the next big earthquake will happen .",
    "previous papers have been focused on the determination of the probability distribution and the presentation of the scaling law , as shown in the works of  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the weibull distribution  @xcite , the exponential distribution  @xcite , the brownian passage time ( bpt ) distribution  @xcite , the generalized gamma distribution  @xcite , and the log normal distribution  @xcite are candidates for the distribution function of interoccurrence times and recurrence times .",
    "also , in the stationary regime , a unified scaling law was proposed by corral  @xcite and then obtained by analyzing the california aftershock data  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the time interval statistics have been studied by numerical simulations of earthquake models  @xcite , because real earthquake data are limited .",
    "for example , both the conceptual spring - block models  @xcite and the sophisticated virtual california model  @xcite show the weibull distribution of the recurrence times .",
    "one of the authors ( th ) also reported that the survivor function of interoccurrence times in the 2d spring - block model can be described by the zipf - mandelbrot type power law  @xcite , which has been observed by abe and suzuki  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a statistical feature of the interoccurrence times , the weibull - log weibull transition , was proposed by analyzing the japan meteorological agency ( jma ) catalog  @xcite .",
    "we found that the probability distribution of interoccurrence times can be very well fitted by the superposition of the log - weibull distribution and the weibull distribution .",
    "in particular , the distribution of large earthquakes obeys the weibull distribution with exponent less than unity indicating that the process of large earthquakes is long - term correlated .",
    "our earlier results emphasize that the interoccurrence time statistics basically contain both weibull and log - weibull statistics , and as the threshold of magnitude @xmath2 is increased , the predominant distribution could change from the log - weibull distribution to the weibull distribution .",
    "those statistical properties , including the weibull - log weibull transition , can be also found in synthetic catalogs produced by the 2d spring - block model  @xcite .",
    "however , the applicability to other tectonic regions of the weibull - log weibull transition remains unsolved .    in this study , we further investigate the interoccurrence time statistics by analyzing the southern california and taiwan earthquake catalogs .",
    "together with previous results from the jma and synthetic catalogs , we show the universal weibull - log weibull transition obtained in all of the catalogs .",
    "we also demonstrate that a crossover magnitude , @xmath0 , between the superposition regime and the pure weibull regime is proportional to the plate velocity , and at the end of this paper we elucidate its implication in the geophysical sense .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have studied the interoccurrence time statistics of natural and synthetic earthquakes by analyzing the jma , scedc , tcwb , and synthetic catalogs and found the universal weibull - log weibull transition of the interoccurrence distribution .",
    "we emphasize that interoccurrence time statistics contain both weibull statistics and log - weibull statistics . and ,",
    "in this paper , we demonstrate the transition does occur for different tectonic settings .",
    "we also observe the area - independent scaling relation , namely @xmath1 .",
    "still the origin of the log - weibull distribution and the weibull - log weibull transition remains open .",
    "our present work represents the first step to fully understand the interoccurrence time statistics and the weibull - log - weibull transition for real earthquakes .    although the scaled crossover magnitudes @xmath3 is area - independent , the crossover magnitude @xmath0 from the superposition regime to the pure weibull regime depends on the tectonic region . the geophysical implication for the area - dependent @xmath0 could be exposed when comparing the plate velocity with _",
    "averaged _ @xmath0 . as clearly seen from table  [ table4 ]",
    ", @xmath0 is on the average proportional to the plate velocity .",
    "that means the magnitude of the largest earthquake , @xmath4 , for a tectonic region is more or less proportional to the plate velocity since @xmath5 .",
    "ruff and kanamori showed a relation stating that the magnitude of characteristic earthquake which occurs in subduction - zone is proportional directly to the convergence rate  @xcite , which is thus consistent with our results .",
    "this study therefore suggests a possible physical interpretation for earlier observation about the velocity - dependence of the characteristic earthquake size .",
    "we would like to thank the jma , scedc , and tcwb for allowing us to use the earthquake data .",
    "the effort of the taiwan central weather bureau to maintain the cwb seismic network is highly appreciated .",

    "ccc is also grateful for research supports from the national science council ( roc ) and the department of earth sciences at national central university ( roc ) .",
