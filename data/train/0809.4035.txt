    "one of the primary goals of modern condensed matter physics is the characterization of strongly correlated quantum systems . a large class of such materials is represented by frustrated antiferromagnets , which are believed to exhibit a variety of novel states of matter at sufficiently strong coupling .",
    "growing experimental evidence indicates that layered materials such as @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite can be adequately described by an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with frustrating next- and next - next - nearest neighbor interactions . as a result ,",
    "the study of low - dimensional magnets and their frustration - driven quantum phase transitions have attracted a lot of theoretical attention in the last decade @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic system , illustrating the effects of frustrating couplings , is the spin-@xmath5 heisenberg model on a square lattice with competing nearest ( @xmath0 ) , and next - nearest ( @xmath1 ) neighbor antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions ( @xmath0-@xmath1 model ) . despite numerous analytical and numerical efforts ,",
    "its phase diagram , which exhibits a two sublattice nel af , quantum paramagnetic , and a four sublattice columnar af states , continues to stir certain controversy ( for a review of recent achievements , see ref . ) .",
    "while existence of the nel - ordered phase at small frustration ratio @xmath6 , and of the columnar af state at large @xmath6 is widely established , properties of the intermediate non - magnetic phase , which occurs around the maximum frustration value @xmath7 , are still under debate .",
    "particularly , the correlated nature of the intermediate state and the kind of quantum phase transition separating it from the nel state , attract most attention .",
    "various methods have been recently applied to characterize the quantum paramagnetic phase , such as green s function monte carlo @xcite , coupled cluster methods @xcite , series expansions @xcite and field - theoretical methods @xcite . as a result , several possible candidate ground states were proposed , namely : spin liquid @xcite , preserving translational and rotational symmetries of the lattice , as well as various lattice symmetry breaking phases , out of which the dimer @xcite , and the _ plaquette resonating valence bond _ phases @xcite are worth mentioning .    not surprisingly , the nature of the quantum phase transition separating the nel - ordered and quantum paramagnetic phases is also under scrutiny .",
    "the most dramatic , and at the same time original , scenario @xcite is believed to violate the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm of phase transitions @xcite which revolves around the concept of an order parameter .",
    "such point of view is based on the observation that there are different spontaneously broken symmetries in the nel and quantum paramagnetic phases , which thus can not be connected by a group - subgroup relation .",
    "the former , of course , breaks the @xmath8 invariance of the hamiltonian and lattice translational symmetry @xmath9 @xcite , but preserves the four - fold rotational symmetry of the square @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the paramagnetic phase is known to restore the spin - rotational symmetry and is believed to break @xmath9 and @xmath10 , due to spontaneous formation of dimers along the links of the lattice @xcite .",
    "it follows then , that these two phases can not be joined by the usual landau second - order critical point .",
    "this phase transition can either be of the first - order @xcite ( the latest coupled cluster calculations @xcite , however , seem to rule out this possibility ) , or represent an example of a second order critical point , which can not be described in terms of a bulk order parameter , but rather in terms of emergent fractional excitations ( spinons ) , which become deconfined right at the critical point @xcite .",
    "however , evidence regarding the structure of the non - magnetic phase is quite controversial .",
    "indeed , the results of spin - wave calculations @xcite , large-@xmath11 expansions @xcite , and calculations using the density matrix renormalization group combined with monte - carlo simulations @xcite are believed to indicate the emergence of a dimer order . on the other hand ,",
    "monte - carlo @xcite and coupled cluster calculations @xcite , and analytical results @xcite seem to support the presence of @xmath10 symmetry ( plaquette - type ordering ) in the paramagnetic phase . in the absence of a reliable numerical or analytical proof of existence of any particular order in the non - magnetic region",
    ", there is no apparent reason to believe in the exotic deconfined quantum criticality scenario .",
    "although there apparently exists numerical evidence @xcite , at the moment of writing the authors are unaware of a local hamiltonian in space dimensions larger than one , rigorously proven to exhibit the type of quantum critical point discussed in ref . .",
    "interestingly , it was demonstrated in ref . that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice model can possess a _",
    "first order _ quantum critical point , which exhibits deconfined excitations .",
    "all in all , the complexity of methods used to infer properties of the paramagnetic phase and the variety of different conclusions have created a certain degree of confusion .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to try to clarify some of this controversy by proposing a controlled and manifestly symmetry preserving method , geared to computing ground state properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "our approach is based on the recently proposed systematic methodology to investigate the behavior of strongly coupled systems @xcite , whose main idea consists of identifying _ relevant _ degrees of freedom and performing an educated approximation , called the hierarchical mean - field ( hmf ) , to uncover the phase diagram and other properties of the system of interest . in a future work",
    "these ideas will be coupled to a new , variational with respect to the energy , renormalization group approach , which thus adapts to the concept of relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "-@xmath1 model , summarizing our results .",
    "in each phase we show spontaneously broken ( framed symbols ) and unbroken symmetries ( usual symbols ) . the translational invariance is broken along both directions in the nel and paramagnetic phases , and only along the @xmath12direction in the columnar phase",
    "this fact is indicated by the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath12 after @xmath9 .",
    "conclusions regarding the order of the phase transition , separating nel and plaquette crystal phases , as well as symmetries of various phases , are based upon extrapolation of our results towards the thermodynamic limit . ]    in the present work we construct hmf approximations for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the crux of our method is the identification of a _ plaquette _ ( spin cluster @xmath14 or even larger @xmath15 ( _ superplaquette _ ) symmetry - preserving cluster ) as the relevant elementary degree of freedom , which captures necessary quantum correlations to represent essential features of the phase diagram .",
    "the importance of this degree of freedom was realized only recently in the present context @xcite , and somewhat earlier in connection with @xmath16 spin - orbital @xcite , and hubbard @xcite models . besides being variational",
    ", our formalism has the attractive feature of preserving fundamental lattice point symmetries and the @xmath8 symmetry of the hamiltonian , by utilizing the schwinger boson - type representation and racah algebra technology . remarkably , such simple mean - field calculation already yields all known results , concerning the phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , with a good accuracy , namely : existence of a nel - ordered phase with antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath17 and spin - wave type excitations for @xmath18 , a non - magnetic intermediate gapped phase , separated by a second order quantum phase transition , and a first order transition point , which is characterized by the discontinuous disappearance of the energy gap and connects the paramagnetic state with the columnar antiferromagnetic phase at @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "we emphasize that our investigation primarily focuses on the symmetry analysis of the various phases . out of many possible coarse graining scenarios , such as covering of the 2d lattice with plaquettes , dimers and crosses , only the @xmath10-_symmetry preserving _ plaquette ( or superplaquette ) covering ( which reproduces the original bravais lattice ) displays the correct phase diagram . in particular , the intermediate paramagnetic phase is shown to be a _",
    "plaquette crystal _ , which preserves spin and lattice rotational symmetries . for all other scenarios ,",
    "including dimerized ( bond - ordered ) phases , we were unable to reproduce all known quantum phase transition points of the model .",
    "we notice that the hmf coarse graining procedure leads to an explicit breaking of a particular translational symmetry . as a result",
    ", one can not draw rigorous conclusions on the order of the phase transitions , based solely on a fixed coarse graining . nevertheless , it is still possible to make some predictions , using a finite - size scaling of the relevant degree of freedom towards the thermodynamic limit , where the effects associated with coarse graining should disappear .",

    "in fact , we can say , that it is a property of our hmf approximation , rather than a numerical evidence .",

    "one obtains the phase diagram , shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "these observations imply that the coarse graining prescriptions ( c)-(e ) are probably a bad starting point for any approximation scheme .",
    "in this section we would like to put our main results in perspective by making several summarizing remarks .",
    "it should be emphasized , that the discussion below is based on our finite - size scaling results .",
    "first of all , from our analysis it follows that dimer ( bond ) order is always unfavorable in the non - magnetic phase .",
    "notice that even when the plaquette coverings were considered such an order did not occur , although spontaneous dimerization was not explicitly prohibited .",
    "instead , the quantum paramagnetic phase prefers to preserve the lattice rotational symmetry , which makes the phase transition separating it from the nel phase fit perfectly well within the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm .",
    "the data presented for the staggered magnetization , fig . [ fig_mag_2x2_4x4 ] , and symmetry - breaking observables , fig .",
    "[ fig_order_parameters ] , indicate that the symmetry group of the nel state is a subgroup of the symmetry group in the paramagnetic phase , as both phases break @xmath9 and preserve @xmath10 , but the latter also preserves @xmath8 . on the contrary",
    ", there is no such group - subgroup relation between the paramagnetic and columnar antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "consequently , the transition between these two states is first order .",
    "these observations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_phase_diagram ] . indeed , starting from the known symmetry in the nel state and assuming validity of the landau theory",
    ", one can unambiguously rule out dimerized structures in the paramagnetic phase , since they break lattice rotational symmetry .",
    "therefore , our results do not favor the scenario of deconfined quantum criticality , advocated in refs . .",
    "as already discussed in the previous section , our method explicitly breaks a particular lattice translational symmetry : the ground state in eq .",
    "( [ hf_wavefunction ] ) at @xmath64 ( af phase ) , is not invariant under a @xmath135 $ ] lattice translation .",
    "one way to cure this problem is to consider variational wavefunctions of the `` resonating plaquette '' type : @xmath136 which restore that symmetry , with @xmath137 the translation operator along the @xmath135 $ ] direction in the lattice .",
    "this state describes two resonating plaquette configurations , shifted with respect to each other along [ 11 ] .",
    "results of calculations using this wavefunction for systems up to @xmath138 spins indicate that for @xmath139 the ground state has long - range nel order and is paramagnetic for @xmath100 .",
    "the intermediate phase has a plaquette crystal order , but with partially restored translational invariance .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath85 is still of the second - order , which is not surprising , as it can be described solely in terms of the @xmath8 order parameter .",
    "however , based on these system sizes , we can not definitively conclude whether this phase transition remains of the second - order or becomes weakly first - order in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "next , we observe that despite profound differences between the 2d and 1d equivalent @xmath0-@xmath1 models , their non - magnetic phases present some similarities . the one - dimensional model is known to be quasi - exactly solvable @xcite at the point @xmath140 and exhibits a paramagnetic ground state with short - range correlations for @xmath1 above the critical value @xcite @xmath141 ( however , due to the peculiar physics in one dimension , the critical point @xmath142 is an essential singularity and , therefore , not obviously accessible for the hmf approximation of the type presented here ) . in this non - magnetic region",
    "the ground state is doubly degenerate , corresponding to two possible coverings of a 1d lattice with dimers , in accordance with the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a finite - size scaling calculation for the gap between the lowest and first excited energy levels , based on exact diagonalization of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 clusters with periodic boundary conditions , does not provide a definitive answer to the question on whether the ground state of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model becomes degenerate in the region @xmath143 .",
    "this is indeed what one would expect on the basis of a generalization of the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem to higher space dimensions ( see , e.g. ref . ) . at the hf level",
    ", it is true that different _ plaquette _ coverings of the lattice have the same energy ( simply because each plaquette is in its singlet ground state ) .",
    "however , the total number of such configurations grows _ sub - exponentially _",
    "@xmath23 , which should be contrasted with the dimer covering problem , where this number is known @xcite to be exponentially large . based on this distinction",
    ", one may speculate that if our plaquette picture is valid , there are not enough different plaquette configurations for the paramagnetic phase to become a spin liquid ( i.e. , a _ resonating plaquette state _ ) .",
    "this statement , certainly , requires a separate investigation .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the main goal of this work is to investigate the fundamental symmetries of the phases exhibited by the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "although the energies presented for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 plaquette cases are different from those , obtained by more sophisticated numerical methods , they can be systematically improved by considering correlated trial wavefunctions or by using more complex methods , which build upon the results reported here .",
    "however , we expect that symmetry - wise our conclusions will remain unchanged .",
    "one of such methods suited for computing the phase diagram of the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which received significantly less attention , amounts to applying the wilson renormalization group procedure @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite .",
    "application of the latter faces serious difficulties in 2d ( see ref . for a related discussion ) and requires a mapping of the 2d system onto a chain , which introduces a certain bias to the final results @xcite .",
    "while formulation of a practical and efficient dmrg approach to 2d systems is yet to be developed , we note that our results may provide a useful and rational initial input for such an algorithm .",
    "in summary , we analyzed the phase diagram of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a square lattice , focusing on symmetries of the various phases .",
    "we showed that in this model the hierarchical language @xcite is defined by identifying the _ plaquette as a relevant degree of freedom_. using an unbiased and manifestly symmetry - conserving mean - field approach we compared it with several other possible candidates : dimer and cross degrees of freedom , as well as different ways to cover a 2d lattice with plaquettes .",
    "our results indicate that the plaquette ( and superplaquette ) covering , which preserves the lattice rotational symmetry has the best energy among considered coarse graining scenarios and it is the only one to reproduce known facts , such as the intermediate phase with gapped excitations , concerning the phase diagram of the model , while other configurations fail to exhibit all quantum phase transition points .",
    "superplaquette degree of freedom .",
    "each spin carries two indices : a @xmath14 plaquette number and a coordinate within this plaquette . ]",
    "consistent with the previous work on the subject , we found the quantum paramagnetic phase in the interval @xmath144 .",
    "main controversies revolve around the nature of this intermediate non - magnetic phase and of the quantum critical point separating it from the nel  ordered state .",
    "we found that the paramagnetic phase is a _ plaquette crystal _ , preserving both lattice and spin rotational symmetries .",
    "extrapolation of our numerical results to the thermodynamic limit suggests that the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm of phase transitions is perfectly applicable in this case .",
    "indeed , within the hmf , there is a group - subgroup relation between symmetries of the non - magnetic and nel phases , which are thus separated by a second - order phase transition . on the contrary , such relation does not exist between the plaquette crystal and columnar antiferromagnetic phases , so the corresponding transition is of the first order .",
    "our plaquette crystal is quite different from the usually proposed dimerized ( bond - ordered ) phases in this non - magnetic region .",
    "we also proposed a way to include fluctuations around the hf ground state and showed that properties of the collective excitation spectrum are consistent with the overall picture of spontaneously broken symmetries .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that the quantum paramagnetic state is characterized by a finite gap in the excitation spectrum , which vanishes in the nel and columnar phases , producing a doubly degenerate goldstone mode .",
    "although currently there exists no known material whose ground state realizes the paramagnetic phase of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , in the future momentum - resolved measurements , such as neutron diffraction methods , can be used to identify the plaquette crystal phase of the type proposed here .",

    "<S> we study the quantum phase diagram and excitation spectrum of the frustrated @xmath0-@xmath1 spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> a hierarchical mean - field approach , at the heart of which lies the idea of identifying _ relevant _ degrees of freedom , is developed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by performing educated , manifestly symmetry preserving mean - field approximations , we unveil fundamental properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare various coverings of the square lattice with plaquettes , dimers and other degrees of freedom , and show that only the _ symmetric plaquette _ covering , which reproduces the original bravais lattice , leads to the known phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase is shown to be a ( singlet ) _ plaquette crystal _ , connected with the neighbouring nel phase by a continuous phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce fluctuations around the hierarchical mean - field solutions , and demonstrate that in the paramagnetic phase the ground and first excited states are separated by a finite gap , which closes in the nel and columnar phases . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the quantum phase transition between nel and paramagnetic phases can be properly described within the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm . </S>"
