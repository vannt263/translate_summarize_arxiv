    "from the neutrino oscillation experiments , we currently know for sure that the neutrinos have tiny but non - zero masses and mix with each other through the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) mixing matrix .",
    "in particular , the mixing pattern of the mns matrix is almost coincident with the so - called tribimaximal ( tbm ) mixing@xcite , given by @xmath1 however , there is no definitive theory to generate the neutrino masses and tbm mixing yet .",
    "the ( type - i ) seesaw mechanism is one of the most plausible extensions of the standard model ( sm ) to produce tiny neutrino masses while as a bonus it can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) through the leptogenesis mechanism@xcite . in the leptogenesis scenario , cp asymmetry is an essential ingredient and it is related to the dirac and majorana phases in the mns matrix .",
    "nevertheless , it is usually very hard to connect them directly because the model also includes some high - energy phases@xcite , which are associated with the heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos , and the cp asymmetry of the leptogenesis depends on the phases as well . in order to establish a direct relation between the cp asymmetry and phases in the mns matrix ,",
    "we need to reduce as many complex parameters as possible in the model . in refs .",
    ", a family symmetry is used to minimize the number of arbitrary parameters in the yukawa sector .",
    "another possibility along this direction is to consider the so - called two - right - handed neutrino ( 2rhn ) seesaw model@xcite , in which the number of parameters is less numerous than the ordinary seesaw model . in addition , spontaneous@xcite and dynamical@xcite cp violating approaches have been proposed .    in this talk",
    ", we introduce the friedberg - lee ( fl ) symmetry@xcite for the neutrino sector and show our results based on ref . .",
    "the fl symmetry is a translational ( hidden ) family symmetry and some detailed analyses for the neutrino sector have been discussed in refs . and .",
    "remarkably , as pointed out in ref . , the introduction of the fl symmetry to the right - handed neutrinos ( rhns ) suggests the existence of a non - interacting massless rhn , and the theory comes down to the 2rhn seesaw model .",
    "this , in fact , motivates us to examine the leptogenesis in the context of the fl symmetry .",
    "we will consider the @xmath0 symmetric fl symmetry@xcite and show that the tbm mixing can be explained by the specific pattern of the fl translation .",
    "in particular , we apply our scheme to the seesaw mechanism and address the bau via the leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "we start our discussion with the lagrangian of the majorana neutrino mass term @xmath2 where the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for family indices . here , we take @xmath5 as a real matrix and consider the diagonal basis of the charged leptons . in this basis",
    ", we impose the fl symmetry on the majorana neutrinos as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a space - time independent grassmann parameter , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are c - numbers .",
    "the mass matrix takes the form @xmath11 we note that the mass matrix has one zero - eigenvalue@xcite , which is ensured by the fl symmetry to keep the invariance . in other words ,",
    "the three - dimensional vector @xmath12 corresponds to the eigenvector of the zero - eigenvalue . ] .",
    "according to the procedure in ref . , we have assumed the relation @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , the mns matrix can be expressed with only @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the pattern of the neutrino mixing is governed by the fl symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fl ] ) .",
    "thus , by comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : fl - mns ] ) with the neutrino oscillation data , we can deduce the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the tbm mixing pattern corresponds to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "interestingly , in this case , the relation assumed above becomes @xmath19 and it can be realized by imposing the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "namely , the fl symmetry , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , combined with the @xmath0 symmetry can naturally lead to the tbm mixing .",
    "so , we define the symmetry as follows @xmath20 and call it twisted fl symmetry@xcite .",
    "note that the shift part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : twfl ] ) is multiplied by a factor of @xmath21 because the overall factor is irrelevant in this discussion .",
    "we apply the twisted fl symmetry to the conventional ( type - i ) seesaw framework with three rhns . the relevant lagrangian is given by @xmath22 where we have omitted family indices .",
    "we assume the diagonal charged lepton mass matrix again and impose the twisted fl symmetry on both the right- and left - handed neutrinos .",
    "due to the symmetry , the majorana mass matrix takes the form @xmath23 in addition to the twisted fl symmetry , we introduce a @xmath24 symmetry for the lepton doublet and charged singlet of the first family in order to reproduce a realistic neutrino mass hierarchy . as a result",

    "( [ eq : mr ] ) can be diagonalized by the tbm matrix in eq .",

    "( [ eq : yd ] ) becomes @xmath28 note that @xmath29 can always be real by suitable redefinitions of the left - handed leptons . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", in this basis , the rhn of the first family can be regarded as a non - interacting massless neutrino . by omitting this field",
    ", we can move to @xmath30 dimensional dirac mass matrix basis and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : yr ] ) as @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the mass matrix of the light neutrinos is written as @xmath33 this matrix can be diagonalized with only one maximal angle and has only one non - zero eigenvalue",
    ". hence , there are two interacting and one non - interacting massless neutrinos and no cp violating phase in the mns matrix .",
    "clearly , it is inconsistent with the experimental data of existing at least two massive light neutrinos and large mixing angles .    in order to obtain a realistic model , we introduce symmetry breaking terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yd ] ) , given by @xmath34 note that the breaking terms violate both the permutation symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twfl ] ) and the @xmath24 symmetry , but still preserve the translational symmetry so that the first family light neutrino remains massless . note",
    "also that although we could introduce breaking terms for the majorana mass matrix as well , we only focus on the effect from the dirac mass matrix in the following discussions .    in the diagonal basis of the rhns , the dirac mass matrix can again be reduced to an @xmath35 dimensional matrix and becomes @xmath36 in what follows , we consider the basis where @xmath29 is real but @xmath37 is complex , @xmath38 .",
