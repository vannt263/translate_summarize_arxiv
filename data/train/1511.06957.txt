    "redshift drift observation directly measures the expansion rate of the universe in the  redshift desert \" of @xmath2 , which is not covered by existing cosmological observations .",
    "therefore , it could be an important supplement to the other cosmological observations . in 1962 , sandage first proposed to directly measure the variation of the redshift of distant sources  @xcite .",
    "then in 1998 , loeb suggested the possibility of detecting redshift drift by decades - long observation of the lyman-@xmath1 forest in the spectra of distant quasars ( quasi - stellar objects , qsos ) @xcite .",
    "thus , redshift drift measurement is also referred to as the sandage - loeb ( sl ) test .",
    "the 39-m european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) ( under construction ) is equipped with a high - resolution spectrograph called codex ( cosmic dynamics experiment ) , which is designed to collect such sl test signals .",
    "a great amount of work has been done on the effect of the sl test on cosmological parameter estimation  @xcite . as far as we know , in most existing works , the best - fit @xmath7 cold dark matter model is usually chosen as the fiducial model in simulating the mock sl test data . when these simulated sl test data are combined with other actual data , tension may exist inside the combined data .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we quantified the impact of future redshift drift measurement on parameter estimation for different dark energy models .",
    "this work was based on 30 qsos , because only about 30 qsos will be bright enough or lie at a high enough redshift to allow observation of the redshift drift using a telescope such as the e - elt , according to a monto carlo simulation  @xcite . to simulate mock sl test data that are consistent with other actual observations , we choose the best - fit dark energy models as the fiducial models in the fit to current data .",
    "we find that the sl test data alone can not tightly constrain dark energy models because of the lack of low - redshift data .",
    "however , when combined with other actual observations , the sl test can effectively break the existing parameter degeneracies in current observations and greatly improve the precision of parameter estimation for widely studied dark energy models  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that aside from the theory of dark energy  @xcite , other explanations for cosmic acceleration exists ; one of the most popular is a modification of einstein s general relativity , i.e. , modified gravity ( mg )  @xcite .",
    "hence , we are very curious about the possible impact of the sl test on cosmological constraints for mg theories .",
    "if the sl test can also effectively improve the constraint results of mg models , we may further affirm the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite that the improvement of parameter estimation by sl test data is independent of the cosmological models in the background . in this paper",
    ", we focus on one popular type of mg theory , @xmath0 theories . in @xmath0 gravity , the torsion scalar @xmath8 in the lagrangian density",
    "is replaced by a generalized function @xmath0 , thus producing a possible mechanism for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "we take two typical models as examples , the power - law model @xmath3 @xcite and the exponential - form model @xmath4 @xcite , and quantify the impact of redshift drift measurement on parameter estimation for these models .",
    "we adopt the @xmath3 model with the form @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the model parameter , and @xmath11 where @xmath6 is the hubble constant .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath12 are the present - day density parameters for the matter and radiation , respectively .",
    "we adopt the @xmath4 model with the form @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the model parameter , @xmath15 , and @xmath16",
    "we first constrain the @xmath0 models using a combination of current data and then choose the best - fit models as fiducial models in producing 30 mock sl test data . finally , we constrain the @xmath0 models again using the simulated sl test data combined with the current data and quantify the improvement in the parameter estimation .    in our analysis ,",
    "the most typical and commonly used current observations are chosen , i.e. , the type ia supernovae ( sne ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , and direct measurement of the hubble constant @xmath6 .",
    "we use the snls3 compilation with a sample of 472 sne  @xcite for the sn data .",
    "we use the bao data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the @xmath17 measurements from the 6dfgs  @xcite , sdss - dr7  @xcite , sdss - dr9  @xcite , and wigglez  @xcite surveys .",
    "because we focus on the geometric measurements in this work , for the cmb data , we use the planck distance priors in ref .",
    "we use the direct measurement of @xmath6 from the hubble space telescope , @xmath18 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19  @xcite .    in the redshift drift measurement",

    ", we can conclude that for the considered @xmath0 models , future sl test data can efficiently break the strong degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath6 existing in the current observational data and thus can greatly improve the precisions of these parameters .",
    "the results are consistent with those of our previous studies on dark energy models @xcite .",
    "thus , we can further confirm that the improvement of parameter estimation by sl test data should be independent of the cosmological models in the background .",
    "it is very significant and necessary to include sl test data in future cosmological constraints .",
    "the sl test directly measures the temporal variation of the redshift of qso lyman-@xmath1 absorption lines in the so - called `` redshift desert '' ( @xmath36 ) , which is not covered by any other cosmological observation . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we performed a serious synthetic exploration of the impact of future sl test data on dark energy constraints .",
    "it was shown that the sl test can break the parameter degeneracies in existing dark energy probes and significantly improve the precision of dark energy constraints .",
    "in particular , combination with the sl test can constrain @xmath5 and @xmath6 to a high precision for all the considered dark energy models .    in this paper , we quantified the impact of future sl test data on one popular type of mg theory , the @xmath0 gravity theories . taking the power - law model @xmath3 and the exponential - form model @xmath4 as examples , we found that by using a 30-year observation of the sl test , the strong parameter degeneracies of @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be effectively broken . for the @xmath3 model ,",
    "the precisions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 based only on current data are constrained to the 4.70% and 2.40% level , whereas those based on current+sl 30-year data are constrained to the 0.97% and 0.93% level , respectively . for the @xmath4 model , the precisions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 based only on current data are constrained to the 4.13% and 1.41% level , whereas those based on current+sl 30-year data are constrained to the 0.94% and 0.44% level , respectively .",
    "thus , the constraint precisions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be improved enormously for the considered @xmath0 models .",
    "however , a 30-year observation of the sl test can improve the precision of the model parameter @xmath10 for the @xmath3 model only moderately and evidently can not affect the precision of the model parameter @xmath14 for the @xmath4 model .",
    "the results for @xmath0 theories are consistent with those for the dark energy models .",
    "we conclude that the improvement of the constraint precision by sl test data is independent of the cosmological models in the background . to make this conclusion more convincing ,",
    "more mg models other than the @xmath0 models should be explored , such as the dvali - gabadadze - porrati model  @xcite and different @xmath37 models  @xcite .",
