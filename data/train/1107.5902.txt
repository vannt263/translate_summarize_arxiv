    "now we consider the origin of dust in the ii zw 40 centre .",
    "one of the natural explanations for the dust mass derived above ( @xmath13@xmath70 ) is production in previous episodes of star formation ( i.e.  preexisting ) .",
    "first , before investigating the possibility of preexisting dust , we examine how much dust can be produced in the current star formation activity . because the age is young , sne are the only source of dust grains and evolved low - mass stars such as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are negligible @xcite .",

    "thus , we expect that the properties of fir dust emission and radio free ",
    "free emission in the ii zw 40 centre are different from global galaxy properties . in this section , we examine this expectation quantitatively by using the results in the above sections .",

    "[ fig : sed_fir ] ) .",

    "<S> the central star - forming region in a blue compact dwarf galaxy , ii zw 40 , was observed in the 340  ghz ( @xmath0 ) band at @xmath1 arcsec ( 250 pc ) resolution with the submillimetre array ( sma ) . a source associated with the central star - forming complex </S>",
    "<S> was detected with a flux of @xmath2 mjy . </S>",
    "<S> the structure is more extended than the beam in the east  west direction . </S>",
    "<S> the sma 880 @xmath3 flux is analyzed by using theoretical models of radio spectral energy distribution along with centimetre interferometric measurements in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we find ( i ) that the sma 880 @xmath3 flux is dominated ( @xmath4 per cent ) by free  </S>",
    "<S> free emission from the central compact star - forming region , and ( ii ) that the contribution from dust emission to the sma 880 @xmath3 flux is at most @xmath5 mjy . </S>",
    "<S> we also utilize our models to derive the radio  fir relation of the ii zw 40 centre , suggesting that free  free absorption at low frequencies ( @xmath6 several ghz ; @xmath7 several cm ) and spatial extent of dust affect the radio  fir relation .    </S>",
