    "ghmann , klmper and seel derived @xcite ( see also @xcite ) a multiple integral formula of matrix elements of a density matrix of a finite segment of arbitrary length @xmath2 of the anti - ferromagnetic spin @xmath3 @xmath0 heisenberg infinite chain at finite temperature in a finite magnetic field by combining the quantum transfer matrix approach @xcite-@xcite and the algebraic bethe ansatz technique .",
    "their formula generalizes the multiple integral formulae for zero temperature @xcite to finite temperature case .",
    "this is a fundamental quantity since thermal average of any operators acting non - trivially on the segment of length @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of their formula .",
    "thus it is an important problem to perform this multiple integral and extract concrete numbers from it .",
    "their formula contains an auxiliary function , which is a solution of a nonlinear integral equation .",
    "this nonlinear integral equation is essentially same as the one for the free energy @xcite .",
    "thus to evaluate their formula consists of two non - trivial tasks : to solve the nonlinear integral equation and to integrate the multiple integrals . in our previous paper @xcite , we applied the high temperature expansion ( hte ) method to a multiple integral formula @xcite of the emptiness formation probability @xmath4 for the @xmath5 model , which is the probability of @xmath2 adjacent spins being aligned upward , and succeeded to obtain the coefficients of @xmath6 up to the order of 42 .",
    "as for zero magnetic field case , there is also numerical calculation @xcite for the multiple integral for @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to expand our previous results on the hte for @xmath4 @xcite to more general correlation functions for the spin @xmath3 isotropic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field @xmath8 . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the multiple integral formula of the matrix elements of the density matrix @xcite . in section 3 , we evaluate this multiple integral by the hte method . based on the result of the hte of the density matrix , we will calculate the hte of two point correlation functions ( [ 2ndzz])-([2ndpm ] ) .",
    "in particular for zero magnetic field case , we have succeeded to obtain the coefficients of the hte of a 3rd neighbor correlation function up to the order of 25 ( cf .",
    "( [ 3rdh=0 ] ) ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath3 isotropic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field @xmath8 is given as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the pauli matrices which act non - trivially on the @xmath13-th lattice site in a chain of length @xmath14 . here",
    "the periodic boundary condition @xmath15 is assumed .",
    "let us introduce @xmath16 matrices : @xmath17 these matrices are embedded into the space @xmath18 on which the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) acts : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the above pauli matrices can be written in terms of these matrices : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we also put @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "ghmann , klmper and seel derived @xcite an integral representation of the density matrix of the @xmath0 chain at finite temperature @xmath28 .",
    "the isotropic ( @xmath5 ) limit of their formula is given as follows .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are solutions of the following integral equations .",
    "@xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are sequences of @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "we define the number of @xmath36 in @xmath34 as @xmath38 and the position @xmath39 of @xmath13-th @xmath36 in @xmath34 as @xmath40 : @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we also define the number of @xmath37 in @xmath35 as @xmath43 and the position @xmath39 of @xmath13-th @xmath37 in @xmath35 as @xmath44 : @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "we shall put @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the contour @xmath51 surrounds the real axis anti - clockwise manner .",
    "@xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 .",
    "the emptiness formation probability is a special case of this density matrix element : @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", the multiple integral formula ( [ density ] ) reduces to the one in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we will calculate the hte of the following two - point correlation functions for finite magnetic field @xmath8 : @xmath55 at @xmath56 , one can express nearest neighbor and 2nd neighbor correlation functions in terms of @xmath57 : @xmath58 , @xmath59",
    ". then we can immediately calculate the hte of these correlation functions up to the order of 42 from the results in @xcite .",
    "we can also calculate the hte of @xmath60 up to the order of 42 from the relation @xmath61 which holds for isotropic model ( @xmath5-model ) at @xmath56 .",
    "moreover one can calculate the nearest neighbor correlation functions by taking the derivative of the free energy of the @xmath0-chain with respect to the anisotropy parameter . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath1 can not be expressed only in terms of @xmath4 even at @xmath56 . at first",
    ", we will calculate the hte of @xmath30 from the nlie ( [ nlie1 ] ) . note that this calculation is similar to the one for the hte for the free energy @xcite .",
    "we assume the following expansion for small @xmath62 : @xmath63 substituting ( [ a - ex ] ) into ( [ nlie1 ] ) , and comparing coefficients of @xmath64 on both sides , we obtain the following integral equation for each @xmath2 ( @xmath65 ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is made of @xmath68 : @xmath69 we can solve ( [ nlie1-mth ] ) recursively .",
    "the first few terms of @xmath70 are @xmath71 one sees that only @xmath72 has a pole at the origin .",
    "one can also solve the integral equation ( [ nlie2 ] ) based on the results of ( [ nlie1 ] ) .",
    "we assume the following expansion for small @xmath62 : @xmath73 substituting ( [ ex - g ] ) into ( [ nlie2 ] ) , we can obtain the coefficients .",
    "the first few terms of @xmath74 are @xmath75 one see that only @xmath76 has a pole at @xmath77",
    ". taking note on the above results and substituting ( [ a - ex ] ) and ( [ ex - g ] ) into ( [ density ] ) , we can calculate the coefficients of the hte for the density matrix in a finite magnetic field @xmath8 only by taking residues at the origin .",
    "then we can calculate the hte of the two point functions ( [ 2ndzz])-([2ndpm ] ) by using the result on the hte of matrix elements of the density matrix .",
    "for example , the hte of a 3rd neighbor correlation function at @xmath56 up to the order of 25 is given as follows : @xmath78 where we put @xmath79 .",
    "we also calculated the hte of @xmath80 for finite magnetic fields @xmath81 up to the order of 30 ; @xmath82 for @xmath81 up to the order of 20 ; @xmath83 for @xmath81 up to the order of 30 . in @xcite ,",
    "the hte of correlation functions for zero magnetic field were calculated up to the order of 19 by other method .",
    "it is remarkable that we can also treat nonzero magnetic field case and the orders of our hte are higher than the ones in @xcite .",
    "we have plotted the pad approximations of the hte of these correlation functions for finite magnetic fields @xmath8 in figures [ zz2af]-[htegreenf ] .",
    "once we introduce the hte , we can also consider @xmath84 case by analytic continuation , though original multiple integral formula ( [ density ] ) was defined for @xmath85 case .",
    "we have also plotted quantum monte carlo simulation ( qmc ) data by shiroishi @xcite based on the open source software in the alps project @xcite .",
    "the system size of the simulations is @xmath86 .",
    "our hte results agree well with these qmc data except in the very low temperature regions .",
    "at least in the region where the pad approximation seems to converge , @xmath80 for @xmath85 at @xmath56 and for @xmath84 , @xmath82 for @xmath84 and @xmath83 at @xmath56 monotonously decrease with respect to temperature ( here we omit a figure of @xmath80 for @xmath84 ) ; @xmath82 for @xmath85 at @xmath56 monotonously increases with respect to temperature . when @xmath87 in figures [ zz2af],[hteaf],[htegreenf ] , peaks appear at non - trivial temperatures .",
