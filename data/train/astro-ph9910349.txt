    "absorption lines in qso spectra offer a direct means of tracing the nature and distribution of gaseous matter in the universe .",
    "the presence of metal lines in these systems ties the absorbing gas to the processes of galaxy formation and evolution . associated absorption systems  those with the absorption redshift , @xmath15 , close to the qso emission redshift , @xmath16  have been classified separately from the general class of ( @xmath17 ) narrow - line absorption systems , and their origin remains uncertain .",
    "these systems are characterized by highly ionized absorption lines and are generally defined by the convention that the relative velocity between the emission redshift and the absorption redshift is @xmath18  km  s@xmath19  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "identifying the mechanism for associated absorption has potentially important implications for galactic formation and evolution .",
    "if the associated systems originate in regions local to the qso , then they provide a direct probe into the inner regions of active galaxies .",
    "associated systems may arise in the halos of neighboring galaxies or the host galaxy of the qso itself with a scale length of tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "foltz et al .",
    "( 1986 ) observed a correlation between associated systems and radio - loud qsos .",
    "the fact that the environments surrounding radio - loud qsos tend to have more nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) may be construed as evidence that @xmath1 systems originate in neighboring galactic structures . however , anderson et al .",
    "( 1987 ) report that although a high incidence of associated systems occur in radio - loud qsos , there is no statistically significant correlation between the two .",
    "barthel , tytler , & thomson ( 1990 ) combined a study with previous work ( @xcite ) and found @xmath1 systems biased towards neither radio - loud nor radio - quiet qsos .",
    "some associated absorption systems show evidence of being intrinsic to the qso engine .",
    "these systems are typically highly ionized given the presence of lithium  like , , and which implies the gas is photoionized by the qso .",
    "in several studies with high quality data , the metallicities of these systems have been solar to several times solar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if these systems originate near the central regions of the qso host galaxy , then the high metallicities agree with predictions of galactic chemical evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see hamann & ferland 1999 for a recent review ) and with the metallicities of qso environments derived from studies of broad absorption line ( bal ) systems and qso emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the poorly understood effects of the covering fraction of the source by the absorber , and inherent line saturation effects produce systematic uncertainties in converting the observed column densities to metallicities .    more evidence for a class of intrinsic , narrow - lined absorption systems comes from dynamical observations .",
    "studies of some bal and associated systems show time variability in their absorption profiles . assuming the qso is the ionizing source , time variability in the absorber implies either that a variable qso flux has changed the ionization state of the cloud , or that the density has changed due to motions not along the line of sight .",
    "either scenario requires small distance scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "multi - epoch observations of q0835 + 5804 and q1157 + 0128 by aldcroft , bechtold , & foltz ( 1997 ) show line strength variability in intrinsic absorption features on the time scale of a few years . in q2343 + 125 , hamann et al .",
    "( 1997a ) observe temporal variations in the @xmath1 absorber between two epochs separated by @xmath20 yr .",
    "they derive covering factors less than unity which indicates that the absorber does not completely occult the emission source . partial coverage of small , dense absorbers produce shallow absorption features with multiplet line equivalent width strength ratios of order unity ( petitjean et al.1994 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . both multi - epoch variations and partial covering factors give strong support to the idea that the absorption originates near the qso emission source .",

    "caution must be used when interpreting the results of the photoionization code since it assumes the absorber is in photoionizational equilibrium .",
    "this is not established _ a priori _ and may produce misleading results ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "the column densities which were deduced in  3.2 provide constraints on the permitted conditions of the absorbing material . assuming these values are a good approximation of the true column densities ( i.e.  no substantial , hidden columns exist ) ,",
    "the conditions of the absorber are almost uniquely reproducible ( aside from systematic effects ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ cloudy_results ] the cloudy results for the single  zone absorption model with a total hydrogen column density , @xmath310  @xmath8 , and metallicity , @xmath311 .",
    "the column densities calculated by the model are shown versus a range of ionization parameters , @xmath308 .",
    "based on the relative velocity  ionization energy relation which we observe in this absorption system ( see  4.3.2 ) , it is unlikely that a single - zone model is a completely adequate description .",
    "the results presented here are , therefore , a simple paradigm for the ionization in this absorber .",
    "the model simultaneously reproduces the observed column densities for @xmath312 and corresponding electron temperature , @xmath313  k.    the derived ionization parameter corresponds to spatial dimensions of @xmath314  pc .",

    "however , as discussed in  4.1 , these features are not exclusive to intrinsic absorbers .",
    "an investigation of the time - variability nature of the absorption lines could provide a useful upper limit on the recombination time , ( @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is the recombination coefficient ) , which in turn would establish a lower limit on the electron density and thus a constraint on the distance from the ionizing source .",
    "the ionization state of the system alone does not distinguish the location of the absorber .    since the derived column densities only provide constraining lower limits , the model depicted in figure  [ cloudy_results ] is not unique .",

    "however , the contribution of neutral hydrogen from the milky way is estimated to be @xmath6@xmath318  @xmath8 , meaning that any further absorption would come from a column of @xmath319  @xmath8 .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath320  @xmath8  is therefore not inconsistent with the x - ray data . since",
    "our derived column densities are only estimates due to the nature of the fos observations , there is a degeneracy between the total column density and the metallicity in the absorption models . using our results from cloudy , for @xmath321 @xmath8 , the metallicity must be significantly higher to account for the observed columns .",
    "subsolar metallicities are likewise not completely excluded , but substantially more @xmath6@xmath322 is expected relative to the metallic columns derived from the fos data in this case .",
    "the positive relative velocity for the @xmath3 absorption system implicitly indicates the absorbing gas is infalling toward the central agn , yet the systemic redshift could be slightly larger than that adopted for q0122 + 0338 , and outflow can not be entirely excluded .",
    "infall has been observed in several other @xmath1 metal systems ( savaglio et al .",
    "1997 ; @xcite ) and in several ly@xmath4absorption systems in a ly@xmath4  emission line survey of radio galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption lines in this system contain varying velocities relative to the emission redshift ( @xmath323  km  s@xmath19 ) and span a wide range of ionization .",
    "furthermore , these properties are correlated in the sense that the centroids of the more highly excited lines have higher relative velocities .",
    "if the absorption system contains multiple components , then the ionization state depends on the density and distance from the ionizing source for each component ( in this case the qso engine ) .",
    "we quantify this relationship by comparing the relative velocity of each line with the _ creation ionization potential energy _",

    ", we plot the velocity of each ion , relative to the emission redshift , versus the cip .",
    "an explanation for this correlation is that the more highly ionized absorption line components are shifted blueward of less ionized ones . clearly , the cip is related to the ionization parameter since at higher values of @xmath308 , more ionizing photons are available to produce the more highly excited ions . using the relationship in equation ( 4 ) , the more blueward line components have lower values of @xmath326 .",
    "the simplest model has two absorption components , with higher and lower levels of ionization , and a velocity separation of @xmath277 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "the convoluted sum of these components results in a shift of the observed absorption line centroids .",
    "the column densities of the lower ionization species ( e.g. , , ) result mostly from the less ionized component and the column densities with the highest ionization ( e.g. , ) result mainly from the higher ionized component with little contribution from the other .",
    "it is interesting that the relative velocity of the lines do not follow the correlation and are approximately equal to the value of the doublet . in the context of a two - component model ,",
    "most of the absorption occurs from the highly ionized line component .",
    "this is plausible since , unlike the other elements in this system , there are no higher ionization states for hydrogen .",
    "it is also possible that if the more highly ionized component occults the other and is not optically thin , then it may shield the lower ionization component from part of the ionizing continuum .",

    "<S> we have studied a spectrum of q0122 + 0338  ( @xmath0 ) obtained by the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present the analysis of three associated ( @xmath1 ) absorption systems at @xmath2 , 1.199 and 1.166 . </S>",
    "<S> the most complex of these at @xmath3 shows strong absorption from the highly ionized transitions of ly@xmath4 , ly@xmath5 , , , , , and possibly . </S>",
    "<S> we derive ( minimal ) ionic column densities for this system of @xmath6@xmath7  @xmath8 , @xmath6@xmath9  @xmath8 , @xmath6@xmath10  @xmath8 , @xmath6@xmath11  @xmath8 , and @xmath6@xmath12  @xmath8 . by comparing the derived column densities with those predicted from numerical photoionization models </S>",
    "<S> , we find that conditions in the absorbing gas are consistent with an absorber with a metallicity @xmath13 and a total absorbing column density of @xmath14  @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the absorption lines in the @xmath3 system suggest that a correlation exists between the relative velocity and the creation ionization potential energy for each transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is evidence that a complex , multi - component absorber exists . </S>",
    "<S> althought the location of the absorber is uncertain ( intrinsic versus intervening ) , we consider the origin of this absorption system using the available data and discuss how the high - ionization , and high - metallicity indicate that the absorber may be intrinsic to q0122 + 0338 . </S>"
