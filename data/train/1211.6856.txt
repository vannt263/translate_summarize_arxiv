    "photoionized nebulae , such as planetary nebulae ( pne ) and h  ii  regions , provide much of our knowledge of elemental abundances in the milky way and other galaxies . accurate measurements of electron temperatures ( @xmath0 ) and densities ( @xmath1 ) are essential for reliable determination of elemental abundances . until recently , the principal means of determining elemental abundances in nebulae has been from the measurement of collisionally excited lines ( cels ) .",
    "the emissivities of these lines relative to a hydrogen line are very sensitive to @xmath0  under typical physical conditions of photoionized nebulae , and thus are much affected by the errors in electron temperatures .",
    "these electron temperatures are in turn derived from the traditional method based on the cel ratios ( @xcite ) , such as the [ o  iii ] @xmath34363/(@xmath34959  +  @xmath35007 ) and [ n  ii ] @xmath35755/(@xmath36548  +  @xmath36584 ) nebular - to - auroral line ratios .",
    "an alternative method of nebular abundance determinations is to ratio the intensity of an optical recombination line ( orl ) of helium or a heavy element with that of hydrogen . unlike cels , such as the [ o  iii ]   and [ n  ii ]  nebular lines ,",
    "whose emissivities relative to a hydrogen recombination line increase exponentially with @xmath0 , the emissivities of heavy element orls relative to a hydrogen recombination line change weakly with both @xmath0  and @xmath1 , as the emissivities of recombination lines have only a similar , power - law dependence on @xmath0  and @xmath1 , apart from the parentage effects to be discussed in section2.2 , and are essentially independent of @xmath1  under typical nebular physical conditions ( e.g. @xcite , b ) .",
    "consequently , the method based on orls is much less affected by temperature measurement errors , and the results in principal should be more conclusive .",
    "it is possible to use the intensity ratio of two orls originating from the recombination of different ion parents to estimate @xmath1  ( @xcite ) , since the density sensitivity of the parent populations is partially reflected in the resultant orl relative intensities .",
    "while emissivities of heavy element orls have only a relatively weak , power - law dependence on @xmath0 , this dependence varies for lines originating from levels of different orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the relative intensities of orls can be used to derive electron temperature , provided that very accurate measurements can be secured ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the sensitivity of the orl ratios to electron temperature and density is very weak , in order to obtain @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s of the nebular regions where orls arise , one needs to acquire high - precision measurements of these orls .",
    "however , given the low nebular abundances of heavy elements ( @xmath510@xmath610@xmath7  or even lower relative to hydrogen ) and the relatively long time scales for a heavy element ion to recombine with an electron under the physical conditions of gaseous nebulae ( @xcite ) , the heavy element orls are very weak compared to the cels and low - order hydrogen lines .",
    "therefore , high - precision measurements of those orls are required .    although several deep spectroscopic surveys have been carried out during the past decade for several dozen galactic disk and bulge pne ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and for a number of galactic and extragalactic h  ii  regions ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , most of the orl measurements are still not accurate enough for nebular analysis , due to either relatively low signal - to - noise ratios or line blending .",
    "currently only a limited number of objects ( mainly nearby galactic pne ) have deep enough spectra for recombination line analysis ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in nebular astrophysics ,",
    "there has been a long - standing dichotomy in abundance determinations and plasma diagnostics . for a given pn , the abundances of heavy - element ions ( c@xmath8 , n@xmath8 , o@xmath8 , and ne@xmath8 ) relative to hydrogen derived from the nebular orls are all higher than the corresponding abundance values derived from their cel counterparts .",
    "the electron temperatures derived from the h  i  balmer jump are also systematically lower than those derived from the cels .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this dichotomy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but have failed to provide a consistent interpretation of all observations , especially for those pne with dramatically large abundance discrepancies ( e.g. @xmath910 , 20 ) . a bi - abundance nebular model postulated by @xcite",
    "provides a more natural explanation of this dichotomy . in this model ,",
    "the orls heavy element ions arise mainly from  cold \" h - deficient inclusions , while the strong cels are emitted predominantly from the warmer ambient ionised gas of  normal \" ( @xmath5solar values ) chemical composition .",
    "deep spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and orl analysis of individual nebulae in the past decade ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have yielded strong evidence for the existence of such a  cold \" component ( recent reviews on this topic are given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed that a @xmath10-distribution for electron energies , which is a departure from the conventional assumption of a maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium energy distribution , can explain the dichotomy in both h  ii  regions and pne .    despite the paucity of high - quality observational data of the heavy element orls as well as the lack of the atomic data that are adequate enough for nebular analysis ,",
    "plasma diagnostics have been carried out for a number of pne and preliminary results have been obtained . using the radiative recombination coefficients of @xcite , @xcite derived electron temperatures using the o  ii  orls for 6 galactic pne , and found an average @xmath0(o  ii  orls )  value of @xmath11  k. @xcite derived @xmath0(o  ii  orls )  for 18 pne , and found an average value of @xmath12  k. @xcite derived electron temperatures for a dozen norther galactic pne using the o  ii  orl ratios @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and v1/@xmath34089 .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath0(o  ii  orls ) for 11 galactic pne using the o  ii  @xmath17  line ratio , and gave an average value of @xmath18  k. however , many of the recombination line intensities used for diagnostics were not corrected for line blending , and the derived electron temperatures could be problematic .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new approach to plasma diagnostics using the n  ii  and o  ii  orls for a sample of pne and h  ii  regions , which are selected from previous optical recombination line surveys and individual - object studies .",
    "the most recent effective recombination coefficients are utilised for the analysis . for each ion",
    ", we use one set of detected orls with the most reliable measurements to constrain @xmath0  and @xmath1  simultaneously , by comparing the observed intensities with the predicted ones .",
    "the primary purpose of the current paper is to show that the plasma diagnostic method employed here is applicable to all emission nebulae , provided that more and more accurate measurements of the n  ii  and o  ii  orls are available in the future .",
    "in this section , we compare the intensities of the observed n  ii  and o  ii  lines with theoretical predictions over a wide range of electron temperatures and densities .          during the past two decades , several deep optical spectroscopic surveys have been carried out and published for several dozens of galactic disk , bulge and halo pne and for a number of galactic and extragalactic h  ii  regions .",
    "these allow for detailed nebular plasma diagnostics and abundance analyses using the relatively weak hydrogen and helium recombination lines / continua and orls from heavy element ions . in total , over 100 pne and 40 h  ii  regions have been studied using orls .",
    "the current paper makes use of the samples from the literature listed in tables 1 and 2 .      of the physical condition and elemental abundance distributions across the nebulae .",
    "@xcite carried out a dedicated study of three galactic pne ( ngc5882 , ngc6153 and ngc7009 ) by means of optical integral field spectroscopy using the fibre large array multi element spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt / flames ) .",
    "the ratio of the abundances derived from orls and cels , which is called the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) , was studied across the nebulae for doubly - ionised oxygen , o@xmath8 .",
    "very small values of the temperature fluctuation parameter @xmath19 ( defined by @xcite , @xcite ) in the plane of the sky were found in all three objects .",
    "most recently , @xcite published results from integral field spectroscopy of a field located near the trapezium cluster in the orion nebula using the potsdam multi - aperture spectrophotometer ( pmas ) .",
    "detailed studies of one of the three most prominent protoplanetary disks ( proplyds ) show that the adf of o@xmath8 is close to one in the proplyd , while the background emission still yields the typical adf(o@xmath8 ) observed in the orion nebula .          since the 1990s",
    ", it has been possible to obtain reliable measurements of the faint orls emitted by heavy element ions for bright nebulae",
    ". however , atomic data are necessary to analyse these spectral features , in particular the effective recombination coefficients .",
    "orl ratios from states of different orbital angular momenta do show some temperature dependence and therefore can be used to measure the average temperature under which the lines are emitted ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "relative populations of the fine - structure levels of the ground term of a recombining ion , such as n@xmath8  in the case of n  ii  and o@xmath8  in the case of o  ii , deviate from the boltzmann distribution and vary as a function of electron density in low - density nebulae .",
    "this variation in the level population is reflected in the emissivities , and thus in the effective recombination coefficients of the recombination lines that are formed from different parent levels .",
    "in essence , the intensity ratio of two such lines can be used to determine electron density ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "high - precision quantum mechanical calculations of the effective recombination coefficients for n  ii  ( @xcite ) , and o  ii  lines ( storey , unpublished ) have been completed .",
    "both calculations improve those from previous work ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest and best - observed lines for n  ii  so far have been those from multiplets v3 3p  @xmath20d ",
    "3s  @xmath20p@xmath21 and v39a , b 4f  g[7/2,9/2 ] ",
    "3d  @xmath20f@xmath21 . for o",

    "fig.1 shows the theoretical fractional intensities of the fine - structure components of the o  ii  multiplet v1 2p@xmath233p@xmath24d@xmath21 ",
    "2p@xmath233s@xmath24p  as a function of electron density at four temperature cases . the same can be seen for the n  ii  multiplet v3 2p3p@xmath20d  2p3s@xmath20p@xmath21 in fig.@xmath25 from @xcite .",
    "fig.2 shows the loci of the o  ii  recombination line ratios i(@xmath34649)/i(@xmath34662 ) and i(@xmath34649)/i(@xmath34089 ) for different @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s .",
    "the same can be seen for n  ii  recombination line ratios i(@xmath35679)/i(@xmath35666 ) and i(@xmath35679)/i(@xmath34041 ) in fig.@xmath26 from @xcite . using the accurate measurements of the n  ii  and o  ii  line ratios",
    ", we can determine @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s simultaneously from the loci .",
    "since different orl ratios of n  ii  or o  ii  have different sensitivity on @xmath0  and @xmath1 , this will affect the reliability of the results .",
    "given the different temperature - dependence of diagnostic lines , individual diagnostic line ratios are expected to yield differing results if the nebulae are not isothermal . while the small values of @xmath27 appear to suggest there are no large temperature variations where the cels are emitted , the discrepancies between the cel and orl diagnostic results definitely exist , thereby suggesting that the gas is not isothermal . while the authors believe that the bi - abundance nebular model is a satisfactory explanation of the abundance ( and temperature ) discrepancies , an alternative explanation involving non - equilibrium electron energies has also been proposed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to @xcite , physical processes such as magnetic reconnection , injection of high - energy electrons through photoionization by a ",
    "hard \" photon spectrum , may generate such non - equilibrium electrons .",
    "the role of shockwaves in generating the discrepancies also needs to be explored .",
    "the choice of abundance discrepancy model , however , does not impact on the validity of the orl diagnostics proposed here .    the traditional method , which uses one line ratio to determine an electron temperature or a density , has the disadvantage that the density or temperature is undefined .",
    "although a temperature - sensitive recombination line ratio is usually quite insensitive to electron density , some density - sensitive line ratios , to a noticeable extent , may vary with electron temperature .",
    "as an example , fig.3 shows the o  ii  @xmath34649/@xmath34662  ratio as a function of electron density . from the figure",
    "one can see that at low densities ( @xmath283.6 ) , the electron density yielded by the observed line ratio may differ by as much as 0.6 dex when the logarithmic temperature @xmath29  increases from 2.6 to 3.6 . instead of using a single line ratio ,",
    "we present our new method using one set of n  ii  or o  ii  orls to constrain the electron temperature and density simultaneously .",
    "our method is based on the fact that the intensity ratio of two of these selected orls is temperature - sensitive , while the ratio of the other ( two ) lines of this group should be density - sensitive ."
