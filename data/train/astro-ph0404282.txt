    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provides a snapshot of the early universe .",
    "the cmb radiation last interacted directly ( i.e. , non - gravitationally ) with matter during the epoch of recombination , the period when the universe became cool enough for atomic nuclei to capture and hold electrons for the first time .",
    "therefore , the cmb provides a sensitive test to any variations in the standard model of recombination .",
    "a number of authors have looked at cmb constraints on variations in standard recombination @xcite .",
    "here we reexamine this question in the light of recent , high - quality data from the wmap satellite @xcite , acbar @xcite , and cbi @xcite , following the parametrization presented in ref .",
    "the wmap data represents a significant improvement over data used in most previous calculations , and significantly tightens the resulting constraints .",
    "in addition , we include the analysis of polarization data in the search for constraints on recombination . the only previous analysis to use the recent wmap data has been given by bean , et al .",
    "@xcite , who examined changes in the ionization history induced by lyman-@xmath7 photons and ionizing photons .",
    "our approach is somewhat different ; we have attempted a more general , model - independent investigation , based on the discussion in ref .",
    "hence , the constraints we derive are not tied to any particular model for altering recombination , but are potentially more general .",
    "further , we have used additional data from acbar and cbi .",
    "in addition to using the te cross - correlation data , we investigate the ability of the e - mode polarization power spectrum to further constrain recombination .    in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] we describe a parameterization of the epoch of recombination and the details of how we obtain constraints on the parameters . in section",

    "the ionization fraction @xmath8 is the fraction of ionized hydrogen present in the universe , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number density of free electrons and @xmath11 is the number density of all hydrogen atoms , both ionized and neutral .",
    "the evolution of @xmath8 is given by the ionization equation and describes the progress of recombination .",
    "the evolution of @xmath8 is given by @xcite @xmath12.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is peebles correction factor , @xmath14 is the recombination coefficient , @xmath15 is the ionization coefficient , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the binding energies if the first two levels of hydrogen , and @xmath18 is the number density of free protons plus hydrogen atoms .",
    "it is our goal to constrain recombination in a general way , rather than investigating specific mechanisms . to that end , we follow the framework presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for modeling a general change in the evolution of the ionization fraction as a function of time .",
    "we modify the ionization history by inserting two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , into equation ( [ eqn : ionizationfraction ] ) : @xmath19.\\ ] ] the constant @xmath0 multiplies the overall rates of both recombination and ionization , while the constant @xmath1 multiplies the binding energies of hydrogen .",
    "the values @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 are the case of standard recombination .",
    "we neglect any corresponding change in helium recombination , as that effect is small and for most models helium recombination is finished by the time hydrogen recombination begins . very roughly",
    ", a change in @xmath0 alone will change the duration of recombination , while keeping the onset of recombination fixed , while altering @xmath1 shifts the onset of recombination to earlier or later redshifts .",
    "our goal is to find a range of recombination histories  that is , regions in parameter space  which are capable of predicting cmb power spectra compatible with the observed cmb power spectra .",
    "we create a grid in , and for each point in this space , we allow a set of five cosmological parameters to vary , as well as the overall normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "the vector of free parameters that we vary is @xmath23=\\{@xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 } : the matter density relative to critical @xmath24 , the baryon matter density @xmath30 , the hubble parameter @xmath26 ( in units of 100 km sec@xmath31 mpc@xmath31 ) , the spectral tilt @xmath27 , the optical depth to the surface of last scattering @xmath28 , and the overall normalization of the power spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "we assume priors for several of these cosmological parameters .",
    "for the hubble parameter , we impose the constraint @xmath32 , consistent with estimates obtained from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project and observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite .",
    "the baryon density is taken from bbn constraints @xcite : @xmath33 .",
    "our estimate for the total matter density comes from supernovae studies @xcite and x - ray observations of the gas mass fraction of relatively relaxed galaxies @xcite .",
    "we combine these , using generous error bars , to get @xmath34 .",
    "these are all taken to be gaussian , with uncertainties at the @xmath6 confidence level . for the spectral tilt @xmath27",
    "we impose a uniform prior of @xmath35 .",
    "values of @xmath27 beyond this range are disallowed .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath27 is generally not well known ; indeed , the best estimates for the value of @xmath27 come from the cmb itself @xcite .",
    "thus we use generous bounds which are theoretically motivated . we do not include priors for the optical depth @xmath28 or the overall normalization of the power spectra @xmath29 .",
    "we additionally restrict our models to a flat @xmath36cdm universe ( @xmath37 ) and adiabatic initial density perturbations .",
    "we then use ` cmbfast ` @xcite to produce a cmb anisotropy spectrum from our model , as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath23 . for each point in space",
    "we vary @xmath23 to minimize @xmath38 , giving the combination of free parameters which is best able to reproduce the observed cmb power spectra for a given @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    for our data we use a combined set consisting of the wmap temperature @xcite and te cross - correlation @xcite data , along with smaller scale temperature data from acbar @xcite and cbi @xcite .",
    "we follow the lead of ref . @xcite in combining the wmap temperature data with the higher @xmath39 data from acbar and cbi .",
    "a calibration uncertainty of @xmath40 is assumed for acbar and @xmath41 for cbi .",
    "although acbar has a @xmath42 beam width uncertainty , this effect is extremely small compared to the calibration uncertainty and we neglect it .",
    "we minimize @xmath38 using the combination of temperature and te power spectra .",
    "altering @xmath0 or @xmath1 from their standard values has a direct effect on how recombination proceeds . the easiest way to see",
    "this is by looking at the ionization fraction @xmath8 as a function of time .",
    "the ionization fraction determines the optical depth , @xmath43 due to thomson scattering , @xmath44",
    "which in turn gives the visibility function , @xmath45 : @xmath46    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure [ fig : xe_vary_ab ] shows the ionization fraction versus redshift for a variety of recombination histories ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) . in each case , the free parameters @xmath23 are fixed at the values \\{@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51}. as @xmath0 increases , recombination has a longer duration , though it starts at about the same time . beyond a certain limit , roughly @xmath52 , recombination proceeds as rapidly as possible , and increasing",
    "@xmath0 has no further effect because in the limit of high @xmath0 , recombination proceeds in equilibrium . as @xmath1 increases , the primary effect is that the onset of recombination shifts to earlier epochs .",
    "a secondary effect is that the duration of recombination increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting visibility functions of the models used in figure [ fig : xe_vary_ab ] are shown in figure [ fig : g_vary_ab ] .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , the redshift of recombination , @xmath53 , moves to more recent times , and the width @xmath54 of the last scattering surface ( lss ) increases .",
    "( we define @xmath53 to be the redshift at which the visibility function is peaked , while @xmath54 is the full - width half - maximum of the visibility function ) . the degeneracy of models with sufficiently high values of @xmath0 is clearly seen . as @xmath1 decreases , the peak of the visibility function and @xmath53 move toward lower redshifts , just as with decreasing @xmath0 . however , with decreasing @xmath1 , unlike decreasing @xmath0 , the width @xmath54 decreases .",
    "thus , at the expense of allowing @xmath54 to change , changing @xmath0 and @xmath1 in opposite directions allows @xmath53 to remain relatively unchanged .",
    "changes to the recombination history have a direct effect on the temperature and polarization anisotropy spectra of the cmb .",
    "decreasing @xmath0 effectively increases the width of the last scattering surface @xmath54 , and to a lesser extent also decreases @xmath53 .",
    "the increase in @xmath54 leads to increased diffusion damping of the anisotropies at large scales so that the peaks in the temperature , polarization , and te cross - correlation power spectra at large scales are all less pronounced .",
    "the decrease in @xmath53 shifts the features of all three power spectra to larger scales .",
    "decreasing @xmath1 primarily decreases @xmath53 and also leads to a slight decrease in the value of @xmath54 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath53 will again shift the features of the power spectra to larger scales . in this case",
    "the relative amplitudes of the peaks vary considerably , whereas when @xmath0 is varied , the relative amplitudes remain fairly constant : as @xmath1 is increased , the height of the even peaks relative to the odd peaks is also increased .",
    "this is due to the change in the ratio of @xmath55 to @xmath56 caused by later recombination . because @xmath54 increases only slightly as @xmath1 is increased ,",
    "diffusion damping at small scales for higher values of @xmath1 is less significant .      , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 regions .",
    "]    the region in parameter space which is consistant with the cmb observations is displayed in figure [ fig : abcontour_wmap+_ttte ] .",

    "it is interesting to examine the manner in which the various cosmological parameters change in order to compensate for changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the shape of the cmb power spectrum is sensitive to changes in each of the cosmological parameters @xcite . increasing the baryon density",
    "suppresses the even peaks with respect to the odd peaks because the increased baryon mass contributes more gravity to the potential wells , lessening the effect of the rarefaction phase of the acoustic oscillations .",
    "increasing the hubble constant will lead to matter - radiation equality happening earlier and an increased expansion rate , thus the power spectrum will tend to have suppressed even peaks and move to slightly lower values of @xmath39 .",
    "an increase in the total matter density keeping the total density fixed at @xmath66 , or equivalently a decrease in the dark energy density , again moves matter - radiation equality to earlier times , which tends to move the spectra to lower @xmath39 and increase the late isw effect .",
    "an increase in the scalar spectral index gives more power to smaller scales , and will tilt the cmb power spectrum , increasing the amplitude at large @xmath39 compared to small @xmath39 . finally , increasing the optical depth due to reionization will decrease the power at small scales by a factor @xmath67 .",

    "an increase in @xmath26 tends to move the peaks to larger scales , counteracting the effect of a higher @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , increasing @xmath1 will enhance the height of the even peaks by increasing @xmath53 , thus lowering the ratio of the baryon to photon density .",
    "this is compensated by a higher values of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , which tend to suppress the height of the even peaks .",

    "in fact , our values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 are quite similar to the wmap values ; this is a reflection of the fact that standard recombination is an excellent fit to the data and is approximately in the center of the distribution of the allowed variant recombination histories .",

    "the range in e - mode polarization power spectra corresponding to recombination histories from this region is very similar to the range in temperature and te cross - correlation power spectra , and is unlikely to be useful in breaking degeneracies in parameter space .",
