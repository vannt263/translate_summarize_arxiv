    "softly broken low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) has many attractive features @xcite .",
    "for example , unlike the standard model ( sm ) , it provides an elegant mechanism for stabilizing the gauge hierarchy with respect to the effects of radiative corrections and a natural weakly - interacting dark matter ( dm ) candidate , in addition to facilitating gauge coupling unification , predicting the existence of a light higgs boson and potentially making a desirable contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "susy has to be ( softly ) broken in order to make contact with reality , which even in the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) introduces a large number of new free parameters , such as the soft susy - breaking ( ssb ) masses , mixings and complex phases in the couplings . because of susy s natural link with grand unified theories ( guts ) , one often explores susy models in which various boundary conditions are imposed on the ssb parameters at the gut scale",
    ".    atlas and cms have already made great strides in searches for susy with @xmath1  fb@xmath2   of data each  @xcite .",
    "however , the presentation of the experimental results from searches for supersymmetric particles or other kinds of new physics at the lhc necessarily involves a certain dependence on the assumed model of new physics .",
    "results from susy searches are usually presented either within the parameter space of a specific susy model or as cross section limits or limits on the masses of particles of `` simplified models ''  @xcite . while the latter approach provides in principle information that is less model - dependent",
    ", the former approach has the advantage that the specific susy models can be confronted also with other constraints , such as limits from higgs searches and searches for dark matter as well as constraints from electroweak precision data and flavour physics .    in order to allow the interpretation of the experimental results in terms of different possible manifestations of susy it is useful to consider certain benchmark models that have fewer free parameters than the most general incarnation of the mssm . for this purpose",
    "we consider several models with gut - scale boundary conditions on the ssb parameters that have frequently been studied up to now in the context of collider and dark matter searches . as an alternative",
    ", we also consider a version of the mssm with 19 parameters , as well as models with r - parity violation and the nmssm . within those models we propose some benchmark subspaces that could be useful for the presentation of experimental results",
    ". we also define specific benchmark points that illustrate different possible experimental signatures and may serve for more detailed detector performance tests and comparisons .",
    "we choose those benchmark points along certain lines in the parameter spaces that share distinctive experimental signatures , which may differ from those in the models most commonly studied to date .",
    "if the susy exclusion limits advance , one can move to the next benchmark point along any of these lines .",
    "this could be useful for investigating the prospective experimental sensitivity or for optimising the search in the relevant parameter region , etc .",
    "a commonly studied model within this broad class of gut - based models is the constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite , in which not only gaugino soft masses unify to a common value @xmath3 at the gut scale , but also the ssb masses of all the sfermions and higgs doublets unify to a common value @xmath4 .",
    "these parameters , along with a common tri - linear ssb parameter @xmath5 , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath6 and the sign of the higgs mixing parameter , sign(@xmath7 ) , form the four continuous and one discrete parameters of the model : @xmath8 the unified parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are thought to appear via some gravity - mediated mechanism , and are defined at the gut scale @xmath9 , whereas @xmath6 ( and sign@xmath10 ) are defined at the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "the cmssm is assumed to conserve multiplicatively the discrete r - parity , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spin of the particle , @xmath13 the lepton number and @xmath14 the baryon number .",
    "this ensures that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and a natural cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate , often thought to be the lightest neutralino .",
    "the cmssm , like many other simple unified models , is a minimal flavor - violating ( mfv ) scenario with no additional flavor - violating terms beyond those in the sm .",
    "additional assumptions may be imposed beyond those in the cmssm .",
    "for example , in the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) there is a specific relation between the trilinear and bilinear ssb parameters and the universal scalar mass : @xmath15  , as may be ascertained by comparing the signs of the gauge and yukawa contributions to the renormalization group equations of the @xmath16 parameters .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite . ]  and the gravitino mass @xmath17 is fixed to be equal to the common scalar mass before renormalization , @xmath18  @xcite . hence , the model has just three free continuous parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath6 is now fixed by the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking conditions .    relaxing the condition on the gravitino mass leads to the very constrained mssm ( vcmssm )  @xcite , which has the same set of free parameters as msugra but may evade the restrictive cosmological and astrophysical constraints due to late decays of neutralinos into gravitinos  )",
    "are often applied at the unification scale @xmath20 , though the underlying theory may enforce them at some other scale such as the planck scale , and renormalization of the ssb parameters between this scale and @xmath20 could be significant . ] .",
    "because of its economy , the cmssm ( and _ a fortiori _ more restricted versions ) may be missing some features of unified models with less restrictive boundary conditions at the unification scale .",
    "in particular , the assumption of unification of the ssb higgs mass with those of the sfermions may easily be relaxed without prejudice to mfv  @xcite . depending on whether the two soft ssb parameters of the higgs sector are the same ( nuhm1 ) or not ( nuhm2",
    ", often simply termed the nuhm ) the free parameters of this model are @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the unified ssb parameter in the higgs sector at @xmath20 , or @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the two independent soft ssb parameters in the higgs sector at @xmath20 .",
    "equivalently , one can trade the new gut scale parameters for one or two parameters at the ew scale . in the nuhm1",
    ", @xmath22 can be traded for @xmath26 _ or _",

    ".      the gauge - mediated susy - breaking ( gmsb ) model is constructed from a gut - scale scenario for susy - breaking mediation in which communication to the visible sector is via gauge interactions  @xcite .",
    "minimal gmsb ( mgmsb ) models have four continuous parameters , namely the messenger field mass - scale , @xmath27 , the visible - sector ssb scale , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( a factor for the gravitino mass ) as well as a discrete parameter , @xmath31 , representing the number of @xmath32 representations of the mediating fields : @xmath33 the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) plays an important role in the phenomenology , since cascade decay chains of each produced sparticle will typically end in the nlsp .",
    "it is commonly the stau , which decays to a tau plus gravitino , or a neutralino , which often decays to a photon plus a gravitino .",
    "depending on the parameters , the nlsps can range between being stable on the time - scales taken to cross a detector , to being prompt and decaying at the interaction point .",
    "for example , in the case of a neutralino nlsp , its decay length is approximately given by  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the photino component of the neutralino . here",
    "@xmath28 sets the sparticle mass scale , and varying @xmath27 changes the decay length according to eq .  [ length ] .",
    "we include in our list of proposed benchmarks below a model with a quasi - stable neutralino nlsp . according to eq .",
    "[ length ] , this can be arranged by increasing @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath27 is close to the gut scale , the resulting spectra can closely resemble those of the cmssm  @xcite , but an intermediate @xmath27 can yield spectra that significantly differ from typical cmssm ones .",
    "some similar features may be found in models that assume universal ssb parameters at a scale below the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly - mediated susy - breaking ( amsb ) model is constructed from a gut - scale scenario for susy - breaking mediation in which communication to the visible sector arises from the super - weyl anomaly  @xcite . in minimal amsb ( mamsb ) models",
    "there are three parameters : a parameter , @xmath4 , contributing to the squared scalar masses at the gut scale which would otherwise be negative ; the vacuum expectation value of the supergravity field representing the sparticle mass scale , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 @xmath38      mixed modulus - anomaly - mediated susy breaking scenarios are inspired by models of string compactification with fluxes  @xcite . in these scenarios",
    "the soft terms receive contributions from both gravity - mediated and anomaly - mediated susy breaking  @xcite , whose relative sizes are characterized by a phenomenological parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this mixed scenario is also known as  mirage mediation \" , since it appears that the gaugino masses unify at an intermediate scale well below @xmath20 .",
    "mm - amsb models are specified by the parameters @xmath40 where @xmath39 determines the relative weight of anomaly and gravity mediation , the @xmath41 are the modular weights of the visible sector matter fields , and @xmath42 appears in the gauge kinetic function  @xcite . in mm - amsb models",
    "the relative size of the gaugino masses @xmath43 and @xmath44 is determined by the parameter @xmath39 , and different values of @xmath39 thus correspond to different mass patterns for the strongly- and weakly - interacting gauginos .",
    "a complementary framework to the above gut - scale models for susy breaking is the phenomenological mssm , with all of its many free parameters specified at the electroweak scale . in order to make a phenomenological analysis of its vast parameter space manageable",
    ", various well - motivated simplifying assumptions have been made .",
    "on the other hand , some of the main assumptions used in the previous sections in reducing the number of mssm parameters to construct the gut - scale models , namely , the physics behind susy breaking , the mediation mechanism and the renormalization group ( rg ) running of the parameters from the ssb scale are not relevant for , and hence decoupled from , typical mssm parametrizations .",
    "one mssm parametrization that has been recently extensively studied involves 19 free parameters of the mssm ( p19mssm )  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the resulting number of ssb parameters are derived from the parent 105 parameters of the mssm by removing all sources of cp violation and generation mixing beyond the sm : assuming the parameters to be real , that all off - diagonal elements in the sfermion mass matrices are equal to zero , and that first- and second - generation soft terms are equal . only the trilinear couplings most relevant for susy effects , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 are included as free parameters .",
    "the other @xmath48 are set to zero .",
    "the free parameters of the p19mssm model are @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the ssb parameters in the gaugino and gluino sector , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the diagonal ssb parameters in the sfermion sector ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) , and @xmath55 denote the trilinear higgs - sfermion coupling in the third generation .",
    "an alternative choice of parameterisation would be to replace the cp - odd neutral higgs mass parameter , @xmath26 , and the higgs doublet mixing parameter , @xmath56 , by the two ssb parameters in the higgs sector , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "other versions of the mssm with different choices of simplifying assumptions , leading to either a reduced or enlarged number of free parameters , have also been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "for some recent work done in the context of the lhc , see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite .        as stated above , in the cmssm r - parity @xmath59",
    "is assumed to hold .",
    "initially , the justification for this symmetry was that it guarantees the stability of the proton , and another attractive feature is that it leads to a good dark matter candidate such as the lightest neutralino .    in the rpv",
    " mssm the discrete symmetry r - parity is replaced by a different symmetry ( such as baryon  triality , or lepton - parity ) , which guarantees proton stability but allows for either lepton  number violation or baryon  number violation .",
    "the lsp is then not stable , and can decay inside or outside the detector , depending on the size of the coupling .",
    "another particle such as the axion , axino or gravitino  @xcite must then comprise the dark matter in the universe .",
    "on the other side , the advantage is that the neutrino masses are automatically included and naturally light @xcite .",
    "the extra possible couplings in the superpotential are @xmath60 + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{xyz}\\lambda_{ijk } ''",

    "the parameters of the constrained rpv  mssm ( rpv - cmssm ; corresponding to the cmssm ) are @xcite @xmath65 where the cmssm parameters are all defined at the unification scale , and @xmath28 corresponds to exactly one of the r - parity violating parameters @xmath66 note that in the cmssm version discussed in  @xcite , @xmath28 was defined at @xmath20 , whereas here we define it at @xmath67 , in order to make the analysis of the possible topologies easier . for the bilinear terms @xmath68 , @xmath69 at the unification scale .",
    "there are however other models that have just one bi - linear term , non  zero at the unification scale : @xmath70 : see for example ref .",
    "note furthermore , that even though just one rpv  coupling is non  zero at the unification scale in these models , the rges generate other non  zero couplings at the weak scale .",
    "due to the diverse phenomenology that may arise from the rpv couplings , we summarize here its general features   ` block softsusy ` parameter ` 8 ` , as described in the ` softsusy ` manual  @xcite . ] .      in the rpv mssm",
    "the lsp typically decays promptly in the detector for couplings larger than about @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting number of different possible new signals coming from the rpv mssm is large , since there are 48 new couplings , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , one can obtain single sparticle production , unlike in the r - parity conserving case , if one assumes that @xmath72 or @xmath73 is at least larger than about @xmath74 , for first - generation incoming quarks ( @xmath75 ) and even larger otherwise .",
    "for many values of @xmath76 , large rpv couplings are strongly bounded from above by existing low - energy data , depending upon sparticle masses .",
    "we therefore concentrate here on the small rpv coupling case , where there should be no contradiction with experimental rpv bounds over regions of mssm parameter space that are viable in the r - parity conserving limit .",
    "we now list some possible signatures . with small rpv couplings ,",
    "one tends to have the usual two - sparticle production via gauge couplings , in particular strong production of gluinos and squarks .",
    "these go through the usual cascade decays until the lsp is reached , which decays via the rpv coupling into standard model particles .",
    "note , however , that the lsp need not be the neutralino . for small rpv couplings there are also large regions of parameter space where the stau is the lsp .",
    "this is for small @xmath4 and large @xmath3 .",
    "these regions also exist in the r - parity conserving cmssm , but are not considered on cosmological grounds . for a neutralino lsp ,",
    "the experimental topologies are as those in the r - parity conserving limit , but instead of missing transverse momentum , additional leptons and jets are obtained from the lsp decay .",
    "for a stau lsp there are typically additional tau leptons in the final state .",
    "whatever the lsp , if the rpv coupling is very small , much less than @xmath71 , one gets delayed lsp decays , leading to displaced vertices , and for the stau a potentially charged track .",
    "we shall first consider how the rpv couplings change the r - parity conserving topologies in the case with a neutralino lsp and strong sparticle production .",
    "the minimal case is di - squark production , where each squark decays to a jet and a neutralino , which then decays via the rpv coupling .",
    "producing gluinos , which then decay via squarks , can add additional jets , and there may be other particles in the chain leading to the additional emission of leptons , weak gauge bosons or jets .",
    "these features suggest inclusive searches , where one allows these particles in addition to the ones listed .",
    "since the cascades are usually decaying on - shell particles , one can examine distributions of invariant masses of the final state particles in order to reconstruct bumps over the backgrounds .",
    "there is no expectation of flavour democracy among the couplings , so flavour subtraction may be used if backgrounds must be beaten down .    for @xmath77 couplings",
    ", a neutralino lsp decays into two charged leptons and a neutrino .",
    "thus the inclusive minimal signature is two jets , two leptons of one flavour , two leptons of another flavour ( which may be the same flavour as the first pair ) and a moderate amount of intrinsic missing energy .",
    "the leptons may or may not be taus for each case .    for @xmath72 couplings , a neutralino lsp decays to a lepton ( approximately half the time into a charged lepton and half the time into a neutrino which yields a small amount of missing transverse momentum ) plus two jets .",
    "thus , the inclusive signal is 4 jets and two leptons",
    ". the lepton may be either a tau or electron or muon .    in the case of @xmath73 couplings",
    ", a neutralino lsp decays to three jets via a virtual squark . in the case",
    "that @xmath78 or @xmath79 are 3 , the jets could be @xmath80 or @xmath81 quarks .",
    "thus , the difficult minimal inclusive signal in this case is ( from di - squark production , where each squark decays to a jet and a neutralino lsp ) eight jets with no intrinsic missing transverse momentum . as mentioned above",
    ", two of the jets may be @xmath81 jets , and two may be replaced by decaying tops .",
    "next , we consider the stau  lsp case . again",
    "the production is dominated by squark and/or gluino pair production .",
    "the cascade decay will typically go via a virtual lightest neutralino , which is usually the nlsp .",
    "this then decays to a tau and the stau lsp . in the case",
    "that @xmath82 is involved with the rpv superpotential coupling directly , then the stau lsp decays directly into two particles as follows : in the case of @xmath83 it decays into two jets , whereas in @xmath77 where @xmath84 or @xmath85 , it decays into a lepton and a neutrino .",
    "thus , these topologies are covered by just assuming a neutralino lsp and using the signature given above in the @xmath72 or @xmath77 paragraphs .",
    "finally , we discuss the case that @xmath82 does _ not _ appear in the rpv coupling . in this case",
    ", the stau decays through a four - body decay  @xcite into a tau and whatever decay products the neutralino would decay to , as specified above . for @xmath77 , the stau will decay to a tau , two charged leptons and a neutrino .",
    "the inclusive signal is thus four charged leptons ( @xmath86 ) , two taus and some missing transverse momentum . for @xmath72",
    "the stau decays to a tau and a lepton ( neutral or charged ) and two jets .",
    "the inclusive signal is therefore 4 jets , two leptons and two taus .",
    "for @xmath73 the stau will decay to a further tau plus 3 jets .",
    "the signature is thus as in the neutralino  lsp case ( 8 jets )",
    "supplemented by four taus . with good",
    "tau  id the additional taus could help search for the most difficult scenario . on the other hand , cases where one can obtain electrons or muons from the cascade decay chain are likely to be more feasible in terms of discovery .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm with a scale invariant superpotential : the @xmath7-term in the superpotential of the mssm is replaced by a coupling to a gauge singlet superfield @xmath12 , whose vev generates automatically an effective @xmath7-term of the order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "the superpotential of the nmssm contains the terms @xmath87 and the nmssm specific soft terms are a soft mass @xmath88 for the scalar components of @xmath12 as well as trilinear couplings @xmath89 . just like the mssm",
    ", the nmssm solves the gauge hierarchy problem , provides a dm candidate , and leads to gauge coupling unification .",
    "the presence of @xmath12 implies an extended higgs sector ( 3 neutral cp - even and 2 neutral cp - odd states ) and an extended neutralino sector ( 5 neutralinos including the singlino ) . in cases where the lsp is singlino - like",
    "there will be significant modifications of all sparticle decay cascades as compared to the mssm",
    ". the extended higgs sector can include light cp - odd or cp - even states implying dominant higgs - to - higgs decays , and higgs production in sparticle decay cascades .",
    "because of a larger number of both superpotential and soft susy breaking parameters than in the cmssm , there are more options for selecting unified boundary conditions at the gut scale .",
    "in particular , one can make less restrictive assumptions on the higgs sector soft terms at the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is entirely possible that the soft terms for the singlet differ from those for the matter residing in complete su(5 ) multiplets .    in the most constrained version , dubbed cnmssm  @xcite , _ all _",
    "soft terms are assumed to be universal at the gut scale just as in the cmssm .",
    "the cnmssm has as many free parameters as the cmssm : the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath14 are replaced by @xmath90 and @xmath91 . with @xmath91 being determined by @xmath67 , one is left with @xmath92 however , phenomenological constraints imply that @xmath4 and @xmath90 are small @xcite ; with @xmath5 being determined by the dm relic density , one is left with @xmath3 as the only essential free parameter ( as a function of which also @xmath93 is determined @xcite )",
    ".    in the cnmssm on the other hand one allows @xmath94 to differ from @xmath4  @xcite , in which case the free parameters are @xmath95    even more relaxed boundary conditions in the higgs sector have been considered .",
    "leaving @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath94 as free parameters and allowing as well non - universality for the higgs soft masses squared lead to a very much broader range of possible phenomenologies as compared to the cnmssm .",
    "for example , it is easy to find fully consistent scenarios with a singlino - like lsp _ and _ light neutral higgs bosons .",
    "once @xmath91 is determined by @xmath67 and @xmath94 by @xmath93 , the parameter space of the semi - constrained snmssm can be taken as @xcite @xmath98     +",
    "one may consider two distinct approaches to the specification of benchmarks for future susy searches at the lhc and elsewhere .",
    "one possible approach is based directly on the latest available experimental information .",
    "this has the advantage of incorporating all the relevant experimental constraints , but also the disadvantage of potentially becoming outmoded as the experimental constraints evolve .",
    "the other approach is to define specific benchmark scenarios that illustrate specific phenomenological possibilities , as exemplified by the sps points and lines defined a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "these have the advantage that many applicable studies have already been made , but on the other hand these points and lines may incorporate the present experimental constraints only partially .",
    "for example , respect of the cosmological dm density constraint is not guaranteed , though one should bear in mind that there are alternative sources of dm , and that in some models , e.g. , the rpv mssm , the dm particle might not be found among the spartners of sm particles .",
    "the most commonly used benchmark scenarios for early lhc searches were defined in  @xcite , where lines and points in the cmssm , mgmsb and mamsb were specified , as well as in the cmssm with non - universal @xmath3 .",

    "as indicated there , all the cmssm points and the cmssm - like point have now been excluded by early lhc data . on the other hand , the mgmsb points and the mamsb point , which have a larger splitting between the coloured and the colour  neutral part of the spectrum , continue to be valid also in view of the limits from lhc susy searches with up to @xmath992  fb@xmath2 .    in this section",
    "we propose new benchmark planes , lines and points , guided also by global susy fits . in our proposal",

    "we propose updated parameter points and lines for the cmssm , and we incorporate also further susy scenarios that were not considered in the sps benchmarks . in addition , we extend our consideration of benchmark lines and points to the nmssm and to rpv models , which , as described above , can allow for significantly different phenomenology as compared to the mssm benchmarks .",

    "the @xmath114 decays 68% of the time to the invisible singlinos and 20% of the time into @xmath122 , where the @xmath112 decays 74% of the time to @xmath123 , with @xmath124 decaying 92% of the time to @xmath125 . as a result ,",
    "15% of all @xmath114 decays and 2% of all left - handed squark decays result in a final state containing eight @xmath81 quarks .",
    "this point serves to illustrate the huge range of scenarios that are possible in the context of the * snmssm*. it will be quite challenging to discover such a scenario .",
    "the same applies to many other `` exotic '' scenarios that are possible within the * snmssm * on the basis of limits on either higgs or supersymmetric particles .",
    "we have proposed in this document various benchmark scenarios for future susy searches at the lhc .",
    "these benchmark subspaces of the mssm could be useful for the presentation of experimental results , and the specific benchmark points illustrate different possible experimental signatures for testing and comparing detector performances . in making our proposals ,",
    "we have been guided by the impressive reaches already demonstrated by the lhc experiments , which already exclude large domains of the parameter spaces of some well - studied models .",
    "on the other hand , even larger domains of parameter space remain to be explored with the increases in luminosity and centre - of - mass energy currently envisaged .",
    "we include in our selection of benchmarks parameter planes that have already been partially explored as well as embedded lines and discrete points , some of which have already been explored by the lhc and other experiments but may serve as useful points for comparison .",
    "the points are defined on parameter lines such that they can be extended to higher masses .",
    "thus as one point becomes excluded , a new point is already defined ( the lightest one not ruled out by an lhc experiment to 95@xmath126 confidence level ) .",
    "our most detailed proposals have been for the cmssm and related models , but we have also made proposals in the contexts of alternative scenarios for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "these proposals are less developed and detailed than in the cmssm , reflecting the fact that , historically , the phenomenologies of these models have been studied less . in view of the increasing pressure applied by the lhc to the cmssm , such alternative models may merit more phenomenological attention in the future . in order to encourage this",
    ", we also provide explicit proposals for benchmark points and parameter planes in the mgmsb , mamsb , and the @xmath59-violating cmssm .",
    "we also include some simplified models with specific collider topologies by exploiting a 19-dimensional parameterisation of a phenomenologically parameterised weak - scale mssm , the p19mssm .",
    "we note that many of the supersymmetric signatures ( for example jets plus missing transverse momentum ) are insensitive to the presence of higgs scalars , as long as their couplings are not too large so as to change the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "thus , some features of our planes , lines and points may apply also to the nmssm , as well as to mssm - based models .",
    "however , it is likely that higgs signals appearing in cascade decays would be different in the nmssm and singlino lsps could extend the length of the cascades .",
    "further , if the lhc should discover a sm - like higgs above about 140 gev , which is above the upper limit of the mssm but not the nmssm , the focus of susy searches would obviously shift away from the mssm to non - minimal realisations of susy .",
    "the same would apply should a relatively light higgs boson be observed decaying to a pair of still lighter scalars .",
    "we have included proposals for benchmark points and a parameter line in the nmssm , in order to illustrate the potentially more `` exotic '' phenomenology in this model .",
    "we thank c. lester , f. moortgat , l. pape , p. pralavorio , g. redlinger , d. stuart and a. tapper for their input and feedback to the proposals presented here .",

    "<S> we define benchmark models for susy searches at the lhc , including the cmssm , nuhm , mgmsb , mamsb , mm - amsb and p19mssm , as well as models with r - parity violation and the nmssm . within the parameter spaces of these models , we propose benchmark subspaces , including planes , lines and points along them </S>",
    "<S> . the planes may be useful for presenting results of the experimental searches in different susy scenarios , while the specific benchmark points may serve for more detailed detector performance tests and comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe algorithms for defining suitable benchmark points along the proposed lines in the parameter spaces , and we define a few benchmark points motivated by recent fits to existing experimental data .    </S>",
