    "molecular clouds are embedded in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy where most of the gas is in an atomic form .",
    "the atomic gas is mostly located in two phases that are in pressure equilibrium , the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) with temperatures of @xmath5  k and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) with @xmath6  k @xcite .",
    "some of the cold atomic gas is also associated with the denser molecular clouds , possibly forming an extended halo or envelope @xcite .",
    "far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons ( @xmath7  ev ) from ob stars produce photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) either at the interface between the  region and the molecular cloud ( classical high density pdrs ) or in neutral components ( atomic or molecular ) of the diffuse interstellar medium ( diffuse pdrs ) .",
    "pdrs are defined as neutral regions where the chemistry and heating are regulated by the fuv photons @xcite .",
    "current understanding of pdrs suggest chemical stratification in which with increasing depth from the surface of the pdr , the dominant carbon - bearing species changes from  through c@xmath8 to co. observations of , and co lines tracing the different layers of pdrs is thus a useful tool to constrain various conditions of the pdrs .",
    "ionized carbon in dense star forming regions is mainly traced using the @xmath2p@xmath9@xmath2p@xmath10 fine structure line at 158  @xcite .",
    "the radio observations of carbon recombination lines ( rrls ) provide a very good alternative way to trace the spatial distribution of ionized carbon .",
    "classical  regions which form part of high - excitation pdrs , are usually identified through the observation of narrow ( 4  10 ) carbon rrls at frequencies @xmath11 1 ghz toward  regions @xcite and have been well studied .",
    "the diffuse  regions which form part of low - excitation pdrs , are identified through observations of carbon rrls in absorption at frequencies below @xmath12 150 mhz and in emission above @xmath12 200 mhz @xcite .",
    "diffuse  regions were discovered more than two decades ago through the detection of carbon rrl in absorption at 26.3 mhz ( c631@xmath13 ) in the direction of cas a @xcite . since then several rrls spanning over 14 to 1400 mhz",
    "have been observed in this direction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and it remains the only diffuse  region which has been studied and modelled in such detail using c rrl .",
    "a smooth transition of lines in absorption at frequencies below 115 mhz to lines in emission at frequencies above 200 mhz has been detected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "moreover , this is the only direction in the galaxy where high resolution ( @xmath12 1 ) image of the diffuse  region in carbon rrls near 332 mhz exist ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig 2 ) .",
    "modeling the line emission in this direction shows that the carbon rrls originate in cold regions with @xmath14 = 75 k and @xmath15 = 0.02  @xcite .",
    "several molecular line studies have been performed towards the direction of cas  a. these observations do not detect much co emission from the disk of cas  a , but identify molecular clumps located primarily to the south east of the disk @xcite .",
    "the diffuse  regions could be coexistent with the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) that produce  absorption toward cas a @xcite or with the molecular component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite . in the direction of cas",

    "the upper state of the  transition at 492  ghz is only 23  k above ground . for this transition ,",
    "the critical density for collisions with h@xmath17 molecules is only 1000  @xcite .",
    "this implies that  is easily excited and also the line is easily detectable even when emitted by moderate density interstellar gas exposed only to a radiation field equal to the mean interstellar radiation field in the solar neighborhood .",
    "thus  can be used as a reliable tracer of the diffuse pdrs as well . here",
    "we present mapping observations at 492  ghz in the direction of cas  a in order to probe whether the  emission like the c rrl emission arise solely from the atomic cnm or the molecular phase also contributes to it .",
    "we have compared the  observations with the c270@xmath13 , , @xmath16co21 and @xmath18co  10 observations available in literature and have used pdr models to explain the neutral carbon and co emission wherever the two spatially overlap .",

    "the  emission does not show any strong morphological correlation with the continuum emission from cas  a. further , we do not detect any obvious broadening or strengthening of spectral lines closer to the continuum peak .",

    "we have derived hydrogen volume densities of the  emitting regions from the /@xmath16co21 intensity ratios using pdr models .",
    "we find that the local hydrogen densities vary from @xmath49  near the  peaks to @xmath50  around co peaks .",

    "we estimate the area filling factor of the  emitting regions to be @xmath51 , while the volume filling factor is on an average @xmath52% .",
