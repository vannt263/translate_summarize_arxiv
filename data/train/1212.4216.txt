    "complex dynamical systems in science and engineering often involve multiple time scales , such as slow and fast time scales , as well as uncertainty caused by noisy fluctuations .",
    "for example , aerosol and pollutant particles , occur in various natural contexts ( e.g. , in atmosphere and ocean coasts @xcite ) and engineering systems ( e.g. spray droplets ) , are described by coupled system of differential equations .",

    "however , stochastic slow manifolds are difficult to depict or visualize . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we approximate these random geometric invariant structures in the case of large time scale separation .",
    "we derive an asymptotic approximation for these stochastic manifolds , and illustrate the random slow manifold reduction by considering the motion of aerosol particles in a random cellular fluid flow .",
