    "mixing of different baryonic states in nuclear systems remains a topic rather exciting but being far from sophisticated understanding .",
    "a long time ago , it was speculated that a nucleus is not generally a pure nucleonic system . due to @xmath11 and @xmath12 transitions",
    ", a nuclear wave function incorporates some admixture of states with one ( or even more ) @xmath13 baryon(s ) @xcite . strictly speaking , also heavier baryons should be taken into account .",
    "admixtures of @xmath14 states in @xmath15 hypernuclei probably are more important for hypernuclear dynamics .",
    "the @xmath16 mass difference ( 80 mev ) is rather less than the @xmath17 difference ( 300 mev ) .",
    "moreover , pionic exchange between @xmath15 and @xmath18 necessarily gives rise to virtual @xmath14 because of zero @xmath15 isospin .",
    "it was suggested a long ago @xcite that the @xmath19 coupling is responsible for the so - called @xmath20he overbinding problem , which was confirmed recently in a consistent study of @xmath21-shell hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "probably , the @xmath19 coupling plays the crucial role in binding of hypertriton @xcite .",
    "the coupling contributes greatly to the @xmath15 binding in nuclear matter @xcite .    however , there are no direct unambiguous measurements of the baryonic admixtures so far .",
    "various processes are considered to detect @xmath13 admixtures in ordinary nuclei , but discrimination between @xmath13 components preexisting in a nucleus and @xmath22 baryons produced in a reaction is a difficult problem ( for some recent attempts , see @xcite ) . for contributions of @xmath19 mixing to @xmath15 hypernuclear binding energies , alternative",
    "dynamical pictures without explicit @xmath23 admixtures usually exist .",
    "for instance , when a single channel @xmath24 interaction is described in terms of correlated two - pion exchange , it is probable that the dynamics of virtual intermediate @xmath14 s is included implicitly .",
    "also effective @xmath25 force can mimic effects of the @xmath26 coupling without explicit @xmath14 degrees of freedom .",
    "several other implications of the @xmath19 coupling providing in principle ways to identify the @xmath14 admixtures , have been discussed .",
    "it was suggested that measurement of hypernuclear magnetic moments is promising for this aim @xcite .",
    "the probability of the rare @xmath27 channel of hypernuclear weak decay is sensitive to @xmath28 admixture @xcite .",
    "the coupling can lead in some cases to the reverse order of spin doublet levels @xcite .",
    "also production of neutron - rich @xmath15 hypernuclei from @xmath29 and @xmath30 reactions can proceed via @xmath31 admixture as a doorway state @xcite .",
    "relevant data are not available so far . moreover , in all of these cases , some background effects [ as meson charge exchange in the @xmath27 decay as well as in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 reactions ] occur , which can hinder detection of @xmath32 admixture .",
    "the @xmath33 coupling in double - strangeness hypernuclei is of particular interest , since the relevant mass difference ( about 25 mev ) is lowest among all possible known baryonic couplings .",
    "however , experimental information on double - strangeness systems is rather scarce so far , and no definite knowledge of the coupling exists yet .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath33 coupling in @xmath34 hypernuclei hypernucleus '' in this context means a state of an @xmath35 hypernucleus with dominant @xmath34 component . ]",
    "have been considered by several groups @xcite . mostly , hypernuclei observed experimentally have been studied , namely , @xmath36he @xcite , @xmath37be , @xmath38b @xcite .",
    "with meson - exchange coupling potentials , probabilities of @xmath39 admixtures less than 1% were obtained . contributions of the coupling to the binding energies are as small as several tenths of mev except the case of extremely strong @xmath34 attraction providing @xmath34 bound state @xcite , when the contribution can reach several mev .",
    "much larger coupling has been obtained @xcite within a quark model predicting free bound @xmath40 dibaryon . in this case , not only @xmath41 , but also @xmath42 component is of a great weight ( more than 10% ) .    myint and",
    "akaishi @xcite argued that the @xmath43 coupling is considerably enhanced in five - baryon hypernucleus @xmath0h .",
    "a proton , appearing from the @xmath44 transition , can be bound rather strongly in the @xmath45 particle .",
    "thus , the difference between the thresholds of channels @xmath46 and @xmath47 is reduced to 8 mev from 29 mev for free @xmath34 and @xmath48 pairs . myint and",
    "akaishi @xcite obtained 1% for the @xmath49 admixture probability and 0.5 mev for the binding excess appearing due to the coupling .",
    "these values are larger than those typically obtained by other authors for other hypernuclei , but still small to provide more or less unambiguous signature of the coupling .    in the studies performed in the 1990s , nijmegen hard - core model d ( nhc - d ) @xcite has been used popularly as a standard meson - theoretical model for @xmath35 interactions .",
    "the reason was that this model is compatible with strong @xmath34 attraction ( @xmath505 mev ) supported by earlier data on @xmath51 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "this strong @xmath34 attraction of nhc - d is due to its specific feature that only the scalar singlet is taken into account . in the cases of the other nijmegen models incorporating the whole scalar nonet , the meson - exchange parts of the @xmath52 interactions are much weaker than those of nhc - d . in the case of the hard - core model f ( nhc - f )",
    "@xcite , for instance , the strength of that part is about a half of nhc - d . of course ,",
    "in these models the hard - core radii can be treated as adjustable parameters to reproduce any strength of @xmath51 interactions .",
    "then , it is difficult to discriminate between strong and weak meson - exchange attraction compensated by small and large hard - core radii , respectively , in @xmath51 single - channel treatment .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath33 coupling of nhc - d is relatively weak because of small contributions of strange mesons , which leads to small @xmath39 admixtures appeared in structure calculations of double-@xmath9 hypernuclei @xcite . in the case of nhc - f , for instance , the @xmath33 coupling has been known to be stronger by about two times than that of nhc - d . as shown later ,",
    "the strength of the @xmath33 coupling of nhc - d is the weakest among the various nijmegen models due to the above - mentioned specific feature .",
    "since the discovery of nagara event identified uniquely as @xmath53he @xcite in 2001 , @xmath34 attraction is believed to be rather less ( @xmath54 mev ) . on the basis of this new datum , hiyama _ et al .",
    "_  have performed the systematical analysis for light double-@xmath9 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the strength of obtained @xmath51 interaction is very similar to the meson - exchange part of nhc - f .",
    "even if nhc - d is used , it is possible to reproduce @xmath55 mev by taking a larger value of its hard - core radius appropriately .",
    "however , weak @xmath51 attraction consistent with @xmath56 mev can be obtained more plausibly by the other nijmegen models .",
    "therefore , it is likely that their stronger @xmath57 coupling interactions are more realistic and the mixing in @xmath34 hypernuclei is more significant than it was speculated earlier from nhc - d .",
    "very recently , myint _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a new study of the five - baryon @xmath34 hypernuclei ( @xmath0h as well as @xmath0he ) and showed that the coupling effect in @xmath58he exceeds considerably that in @xmath0h . since @xmath59 is lighter than @xmath60 by 6.4 mev , the threshold difference of channels @xmath61 and @xmath62 is as small as 2.4 mev .",
    "so the @xmath39 admixture is probably greatest in @xmath0he , and remarkable difference between @xmath0he and @xmath58h binding energies appears .",
    "similar suggestions have been made also in @xcite .    in this paper",

    "accurate five - body calculations for hypernuclei @xmath66h and @xmath0he are available so far only in the single - channel approach without baryonic mixings @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "three - body models were utilized with free two - baryon @xmath35 potentials ( more precisely , their phase - equivalents ) .",
    "since we also do not solve the five - body problem directly , we use effective ( @xmath6-matrix ) two - body @xmath67 and @xmath63 interactions instead of free - space ones . here",
    ", we adopt the hartree - fock ( hf ) description , which is not only simpler , but also is suitable for the @xmath6-matrix formalism defined in a single - particle model space .    because density distributions of the lightest nuclei are known to be described poorly in the hf approximation",
    ", we do not apply the hf description for all the five baryons .",
    "instead , we treat the hypernuclei as @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the @xmath34 and @xmath39 channels , respectively .",
    "the nuclear cores are treated as inert , and hyperon - nucleus interactions are described fully by @xmath65z and @xmath70he potentials .",
    "this hf approach is similar to that in @xcite , but it is extended to incorporate the second channel .",
    "we adopt the wave function of the five - baryon hypernucleus as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are the three - nucleon core wave function and single - particle wave functions of @xmath9 , nucleon ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath76 components appear from the @xmath77 transition . for brevity ,",
    "spin parts are not shown explicitly in the wave function above .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the single @xmath74 state corresponding to the ground state @xmath78 particle and also to the @xmath79 states of the hyperons . since all the baryons are in @xmath21 states , the kinetic energy term containing scalar product of gradients acting on @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite vanishes identically . excluding c.m .",
    "motion in the usual way and neglecting at that instance the difference between c.m .",

    "the threshold - energy difference @xmath86 is taken as 8.4 ( 2.4 ) mev for @xmath0h ( @xmath0he )",
    ". then , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the diagonal potentials , whereas @xmath89 is the nondiagonal one , where the nucleon radial wave function @xmath90 is calculated in the same potential as in @xcite .",

    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 correspond to @xmath9-core , @xmath8 , @xmath4 diagonal and @xmath94 coupling interactions , respectively . if @xmath72 and @xmath74 are normalized to unity , the normalizing condition for @xmath95 and @xmath96 is @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 and @xmath99 depend on @xmath83 , the system must be solved self - consistently as usually in hf approaches .    in ( [ e2 ] ) , only one state ( @xmath100 ) is kept .",
    "generally , it is an important problem how to take account of other states beyond the @xmath79 shell .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath63 coupling contributes to the @xmath101he binding energy sizably ( though not so much for realistic interactions ) @xcite , despite that all the nucleonic @xmath79 states are occupied . in our approach , highly - excited components are renormalized into the effective @xmath51 interactions in some approximate way , as commented in the end of subsec .",

    "usually , the isle - type potentials are treated as more realistic for light hypernuclei .",
    "however , it is instructive that there exists such a high sensitivity of the coupling effect to the shape of the @xmath15-core and @xmath64 potentials .",
    "though the coupling effect in the calculation with the org - type potentials is probably overestimated , it is still possible that the true effect is somewhat larger than that obtained with the isle - type potentials .",
    "we studied properties of mirror hypernuclei @xmath0h and @xmath58he in the two - channel approach with @xmath6-matrix effective interactions .",
    "the @xmath33 coupling is particularly efficient in these hypernuclei owing to the small energy - differences between the @xmath51 and @xmath41 states .",
    "most importantly , the coupling in @xmath0he is substantially larger than in @xmath0h .",
    "the @xmath33 coupling leads to considerable difference of the binding energies of @xmath0he and @xmath58h .",
    "this difference hardly can be explained by any other reasons and can be a clear signature of the baryonic mixing .",
    "possibly , it is the most unambiguous signature of baryonic mixing among various suggestions considered so far for ordinary nuclei as well as hypernuclei .    essentially , the effect analyzed here is a charge symmetry breaking effect of an unusual ( many - body ) nature .",
    "namely , the @xmath34 interaction in the mirror @xmath34 hypernuclei appears to be different due to electromagnetic mass difference of @xmath60 and @xmath59 , since different nucleonic states in the mirror cores are occupied .",
    "another charge symmetry breaking mechanism for free @xmath24 interaction , originating from the mass difference of @xmath28 and @xmath190 , has been suggested by dalitz and von hippel @xcite ( for further studies , see @xcite ) . by contrast , our mechanism is essentially many - body , existing only due to the nuclear environment .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that detailed knowledge of the @xmath142 and @xmath65z potentials is needed in order to extract the @xmath33 coupling strength quantitatively from future data on @xmath0h and @xmath0he . whereas the @xmath9-nucleus interaction",
    ", though being far from complete understanding , is recognized to a large extent , @xmath39-nucleus interaction is known quite poorly at present .",
    "our consideration exhibits that generally there are no separate branches of @xmath34 and @xmath39 hypernuclear dynamics , but rather the unified field of @xmath35 hypernuclei .",
    "we showed the example when not only the @xmath33 coupling interaction , but also the @xmath39-nucleus diagonal potential , is essential for @xmath34 hypernuclear properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the same @xmath33 potential is responsible for conversion widths of @xmath39 hypernuclei whereas branching ratios of conversion channels depend substantially on the @xmath162 potential @xcite .    due to the small mass difference of the @xmath41 and @xmath162",
    "pairs , the @xmath41 admixtures in @xmath34 hypernuclei are not only important , but rather its importance is drastically different in different hypernuclei ( and , probably , in different states ) . evidently , the @xmath41 mixing in the five - baryon @xmath34 hypernuclei is considerably larger than in @xmath191he .",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath33 coupling effect in @xmath192h is also large @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that baryonic spatial distributions in @xmath192h are expectedly rather extended .",
    "we showed here that it is an unfavorable factor for the coupling .",
    "this problem is very interesting in view of the question whether @xmath193h is bound or not , which was answered oppositely in two recent studies @xcite basing on comprehensive four - body ( however , single - channel ) calculations .",
    "lastly , some comments on the possible observation of the five - body @xmath162 hypernuclei are in order",
    ". the @xmath0h hypernucleus can be produced both from @xmath60 capture reactions @xcite or the @xmath194li@xmath195 reaction @xcite and detected by characteristic @xmath196 emission @xcite though detection by the @xmath197 weak decay suggested in @xcite is problematic in view of recent calculations @xcite predicting very small branching ratios for the @xmath14 emission channel .",
    "on the other hand , production rates of @xmath0he from @xmath138 capture by various nuclei are much smaller @xcite .",
    "possibly , @xmath0he can be produced with a detectable probability from @xmath60 capture by lithium .",
    "however , the detection of @xmath58he is rather difficult since its @xmath196 decay is expectedly rather improbable .",
    "the technique to detect @xmath0he is , therefore , an open problem ."
