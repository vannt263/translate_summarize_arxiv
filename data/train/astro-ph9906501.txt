    "very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray astronomy , ( defined here as observations at energies above 300gev and below 100tev ) became viable with the development of the atmospheric cherenkov imaging technique which crossed the vital detection threshold with the detection of the crab nebula ten years ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "although at the periphery of the observable electromagnetic spectrum , the vhe band must now be considered a legitimate astronomical discipline with established sources , both steady and variable , both galactic and extragalactic , a growing number of observatories , and the promise of significant advances in detection techniques in the next few years .",
    "the confirmation of the detection of the crab nebula by more than eight groups over the past decade has given credibility to the existence of sources of tev @xmath0-rays and led to a rapid improvement in the sensitivity of ground - based @xmath0-ray detection techniques .",
    "the challenge therefore in this short review , which is aimed at the general astronomical community , is to convince the reader that there are viable methods of detecting @xmath0-rays of energy 300gev and above from the ground , that a population of credible sources of various classes have been detected , and that these detections make a significant contribution to the astrophysics of high energy sources .",
    "although , as we shall see later , there are plans to extend the ground - based detection techniques down to energies of 20gev , and there are viable air shower experiments that operate at energies of 50tev and above , this review will focus on observations in the 300gev to 30tev energy range ; this has been the most studied energy band because it is easily accessible to the atmospheric cherenkov imaging technique .",
    "the physics involved in the interaction of photons with matter is well established . at energies above 10mev",
    "the predominant interaction is pair production in which a @xmath0-ray is converted into an electron - positron pair in the presence of a nucleus : e@xmath1 m@xmath2c@xmath3 + m@xmath4c@xmath3 .",
    "the electron and positron carry information about the direction , energy and polarization of the primary @xmath0-ray and hence detection methods focus on the observation of these secondary particles .",
    "the interaction length of photons in matter is 30g - cm@xmath3 and the earth s atmosphere is 1030g - cm@xmath3 thick , so the preferred ( only ) method of unambiguously detecting high energy @xmath0-rays is from space vehicles ( from balloons initially but now from satellites ) .",
    "the basic elements of a space - borne @xmath0-ray detector are therefore ( 1 ) a particle detector in which the @xmath0-ray interacts and the resulting electron pair tracks are recorded ; ( 2 ) a calorimeter in which the electrons are absorbed and their total energy recorded ; ( 3 ) an anti - coincidence shield surrounding the tracking detector which registers ( and rejects ) the incidence of charged cosmic - ray particles ( which are about 10,000 times more numerous than the @xmath0-rays ) . in most of the telescopes flown to date ,",
    "the tracking detector has been a spark chamber , the calorimeter a sodium iodide crystal and the anti - coincidence detector a thin sheet of scintillator .",
    "the resulting telescope is a sophisticated device which can unambiguously identify @xmath0-rays , has an energy resolution of about 15% , an angular resolution of 1@xmath6 and a field of view of 20@xmath6 to 40@xmath6 half angle .",
    "unfortunately this sophistication does not come cheaply ; the effective collection area is only a small fraction of the total telescope area so that in the largest telescope flown to date , the hugely successful energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the effective collection area was only 1,500cm@xmath3 ( about the size of two pages of this journal ! ) whereas the actual physical instrument was about the size of a compact car .",
    "all of the @xmath0-ray telescopes flown to date ( the sas - ii telescope in 1973 , the cos - b telescope in 1975 , egret in 1991 ) have had the same functional form ; the next generation space telescope , the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , scheduled for launch in 2005 ( @xcite ) has the same general features but will use solid state detectors with a factor of 10 - 30 improvement in sensitivity .",
    "the third egret catalog ( based on some four years of observation by egret ) ( @xcite ) contains a listing of more than 250 sources of @xmath7100mev @xmath0-rays , more than half of which are unidentified with any known astronomical object .",
    "in addition to a detailed map of the diffuse emission along the galactic plane , there is evidence for more than 100 galactic sources , a small number of which have been identified with pulsars and possibly with supernova remnants . the bulk of the sources away from the plane are extragalactic and have been identified with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , almost all of which are blazars . some of the sources are variable indicating that the high energy @xmath0-ray sky is a dynamic place .",
    "many of the identified sources ( pulsars , agns ) have very flat spectra and have luminosities that peak in the high energy region of the spectrum .",
    "the egret sensitivity extends to 10 gev but is limited by the calorimeter ( at the highest energies the cascade from the electron - positron pair is not contained and charged particles from the cascade can reach the anti - coincidence detector , causing a veto of the event ) .",
    "since the source flux almost invariably decreases as energy increases , it is only possible to extend observations by building larger telescopes . even for a flat spectrum source ( power law with differential spectral index -2.0 )",
    ", the power sensitivity of egret falls off with energy .",
    "the earth s atmosphere is as opaque to photons of energy @xmath7300gev as it is to photons in the _ cgro _ range ( 100kev to 30gev ) . however , at these higher energies the effects of atmospheric absorption are detectable at ground level , either as a shower of secondary particles from the resulting electromagnetic cascade or as a flash of cherenkov light from the passage of these particles through the earth s atmosphere . as in the _ cgro _ range ,",
    "@xmath0-ray observations are severely limited by the charged cosmic particle flux which gives superficially similar signals at ground - level and , for a given photon energy , is 10,000 times more numerous .",
    "it is not possible to veto out the charged cosmic - ray background with an anti - coincidence shield . as such",
    ", it might seem impossible to do @xmath0-ray astronomy with such indirect techniques .",
    "however there are small , but significant , differences in the cascades resulting from the impact of a photon and a proton on the upper atmosphere ; also the electromagnetic cascade retains the original direction of the photon to a high degree , and the spread of secondary particles and cherenkov photons is so large so that a simple detector can have an incredible ( by space - based @xmath0-ray detector standards ) collection area .    in practice",
    "the most successful detectors are atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescopes ( acits ) which record the images of the cherenkov light flashes and which can identify the images of electromagnetic cascades from putative sources with 99.7% efficiency ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "originally proposed in 1977 ( @xcite ) , the technique was not demonstrated until ten years later when the whipple observatory 10-m reflector ( figure  [ 10m - fig ] ) was equipped with a primitive imaging camera and used to detect the crab nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "the technology was not new ( arrays of fast photomultiplier tubes in the focal plane of large optical reflectors with readout through standard fast amplifiers , discriminators and analog - to - digital converters ) but the technique was only fully exploited in the past decade .",
    "compared to high energy space telescopes such as egret , acits have large collection areas ( @xmath750,000m@xmath3 ) and high angular resolution ( @xmath80.1@xmath6 ) .",
    "acits also have reasonably good energy resolution ( @xmath9 ) , but small fields of view ( fov ) ( @xmath105@xmath11 ) and a background of diffuse cosmic electrons which produce electromagnetic cascades identical to those of @xmath0-rays .",
    "acits also have low duty cycles ( @xmath1010% ) because the cherenkov signals are faint and produced at altitudes of several kilometers , requiring cloudless , moonless skies for observations .",
    "most of the results reported to date have been in the energy range 300gev to 30tev .    in recent years",
    "vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy has seen two major advances : first , the development of high resolution acits has permitted the efficient rejection of the hadronic background , and second , the construction of arrays of acits has improved the measurement of the energy spectra from @xmath0-ray sources . the first is exemplified by the whipple observatory 10-m telescope with more modern versions , cat , a french telescope in pyrenes ( @xcite ) , and cangaroo , a japanese - australian telescope in woomera , australia ( @xcite ) . the most significant examples of the second are hegra , a five telescope array of small imaging telescopes on la palma in the canary islands run by an armenian - german - spanish collaboration ( @xcite ) , and the seven telescope array in utah , which is operated by a group of japanese institutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "these techniques are relatively mature and the results from contemporaneous observations of the same source with different telescopes are consistent ( @xcite ) .",
    "vigorous observing programs are now in place at all of these facilities .",
    "a vital observing threshold has been achieved whereby both galactic and extragalactic sources have been reliably detected .",
    "many exciting results are anticipated as more of the sky is observed with this present generation of telescopes .",
    "the atmospheric cherenkov imaging technique has now been adopted at a number of observatories whose properties are summarized in table  [ tels - table ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the crab nebula is a somewhat unique object and hence one could not confidently predict what other supernova remnants might be detectable . the crab is a member of that sub - class of supernova remnants known as plerions in which a bubble of relativistic particles is powered by a central pulsar .",
    "no other plerions have been seen by telescopes in the northern hemisphere ( @xcite ) ( table  [ plerion - table ] ) .",
    "however two have been detected in the southern hemisphere by the cangaroo group .",
    "they first reported a detection of psr1706 - 44 at tev energies in 1993 ( @xcite ) based on sixty hours of observation in the summer of 1992 . psr1706 - 44 is identified with a pulsar ( of period 102 ms ) and appears to be associated with a supernova remnant , possibly a plerion . at gev energies",
    "it has a very flat spectrum .",
    "the energy spectrum is hard with a flux above 1 tev of about @xmath12-@xmath13-s@xmath14 .",
    "there is no evidence that the signal is periodic .",
    "the detection has been confirmed by the university of durham group working in narrabri , australia ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cangaroo group have also reported the detection of a 6@xmath15 signal from the vicinity of the vela pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the integral @xmath0-ray flux above 2.5 tev is @xmath16 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 .",
    "again there is no evidence for periodicity and the flux limit is about a factor of ten less than the steady flux .",
    "the signal is offset ( by 0.14@xmath11 ) from the pulsar position which makes it more likely that the source is a synchrotron nebula . since",
    "this offset position is coincident with the birthplace of the pulsar it is suggested that the progenitor electrons are relics of the initial supernova explosion and they have survived because the magnetic field was weak .",
    "the power spectra of most of the @xmath0-ray pulsars ( @xcite ) are extremely flat with maximum power often coming in the gev energy range ( see figure  [ pulsars - fig ] ) . because pulsar models often involve electrons with energies up to 10@xmath17ev , it would come as no surprise if tev @xmath0-rays should emerge from the pulsar magnetosphere and be detected .",
    "although there is , as yet , no established model for high energy @xmath0-ray emission from pulsars , it appears that , in general , the detection of pulsed tev @xmath0-rays would favor outer gap ( @xcite ) over polar cap ( @xcite ) models .",
    "this is because , in the latter models , the tev @xmath0-rays are attenuated by pair - production interactions with the intense magnetic fields near the pulsars .",
    "sensitive upper limits have been obtained for emission by the crab pulsar ( @xcite ) , geminga ( @xcite ) and the vela pulsar ( @xcite ) ; in general these confirm the steepening of the spectra seen at 10gev energies .",
    "the radio pulsar psr1951 + 32 is particularly interesting because the power spectrum indicates that the maximum power occurs at energies of at least a few gev ( figure  [ pulsars - fig ] ) ; in the egret measurements there is no evidence for a high energy cut - off .",
    "in fact , the flux continues to rise with energy up to the highest energy observation .",
    "outer gap models suggest that the pulsar should be detectable at higher energies .",
    "observations of psr1951 + 32 by the whipple group reported only an upper limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "this upper limit to the pulsed flux is two orders of magnitude below the flux extrapolated from the egret measurements .",
    "this represents the most dramatic turn - over in the spectrum of a @xmath0-ray pulsar and hence puts the most severe constraints on the models .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are widely believed to be the sources of hadronic cosmic rays up to energies of approximately @xmath18ev , where @xmath19 is the nuclear charge of the particle ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the arguments in support of this statement are two - fold .",
    "first , supernova blast shocks are some of the few galactic sites capable of satisfying the energy required for the production of galactic cosmic rays , although even these must have a high efficiency , @xmath810%  30% ( e.g. , drury , markiewicz & vlk 1989 ) , for converting the kinetic energy of supernova explosions into high energy particles .",
    "second , the model of diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which provides a plausible mechanism for efficiently converting the explosion energy into accelerated particles , naturally produces a power - law spectrum of @xmath20 .",
    "this is consistent with the inferred spectral index at the source for the observed local cosmic - ray spectrum of @xmath21 , after correcting for the effects of propagation in the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origins of cosmic rays can not be studied directly because interstellar magnetic fields isotropize their directions , except perhaps at the highest energies ( @xmath22ev ) .",
    "thus , we must look for indirect signals of their presence from astrophysical sources .",
    "that snrs accelerate _",
    "electrons _ to high energies is well - established from observations of synchrotron emission in the shells of snrs at radio and , more recently , x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) wavelengths .",
    "however , it is difficult to extrapolate from these data to inferences about the nature of the acceleration of hadrons in these same objects .",
    "evidence of shock acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays in snr shells could come from measurements of @xmath0-ray emission in these objects .",
    "collisions of cosmic - ray nuclei with the interstellar medium result in the production of neutral pions which subsequently decay into @xmath0-rays .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum would extend from below 10mev up to @xmath81/10 of the maximum proton energy ( @xmath23tev ) , with a distinctive break in the spectrum near 100mev due to the resonance in the cross - section for @xmath24 production .",
    "as @xmath0-ray production requires interaction of the hadronic cosmic rays with target nuclei , this emission should be stronger for those snr located near , or interacting with , dense targets , such as molecular clouds .",
    "the cosmic - ray density , and hence the associated @xmath0-ray luminosity , will increase with time as the snr passes through its free expansion phase , will peak when the snr has swept up as much interstellar material as contained in the supernova ejecta ( the sedov phase ) and gradually decline thereafter ( drury , aharonian & vlk 1994 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0-ray bright snrs should be `` middle - aged . ''    from the calculations of drury",
    "et al . ( 1994 ) , the luminosity of @xmath0-rays from secondary pion production may be detectable by the current generation of satellite - based and ground - based @xmath0-ray detectors , particularly if the objects are located in a region of relatively high density in the interstellar medium . in support of this hypothesis ,",
    "egret has detected signals from several regions of the sky consistent with the positions of shell - type snrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the egret detections alone are not sufficient to claim the presence of high energy hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "for instance , the relatively poor angular resolution of egret makes difficult to definitively identify the detected object with the snr shell .",
    "because of this , embedded pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; harrus , hughes & helfand 1996 ) and an x - ray binary ( @xcite ) consistent with the positions of some of these egret sources have been suggested as alternative counterparts . in addition , significant background from the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission complicates spectral measurements . to complicate matters further , with the detection of x - ray synchrotron radiation from snr shells ,",
    "the possibility that @xmath0-rays could be produced via inverse compton scattering of ambient soft photons has been realized ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . bremsstrahlung radiation may also be a significant source of @xmath0-rays at mev - gev energies ( @xcite ; gaisser , protheroe & stanev 1998 ) .",

    "vhe @xmath0-ray telescopes have much better angular resolution than egret , reducing the source confusion associated with any detection .",
    "also , because the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission has a relatively steep spectrum , @xmath28 ( @xcite ) , compared with the expected @xmath29 spectrum of @xmath0-rays from secondary pion decay , contamination from background @xmath0-ray emission should be less in the vhe range .",
    "thus , in recent years , searches for emission from shell - type snrs have been a central part of the observation program of vhe telescopes .",
    "the whipple collaboration has published the results of observations of six shell - type snrs ( ic443 , @xmath0-cygni , w44 , w51 , w63 , and tycho ) selected as strong @xmath0-ray candidates based on their radio properties , distance , small angular size , and possible association with a molecular cloud ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the small angular size was made a requirement due to the limited field of view ( @xmath30 diameter ) of the whipple telescope at that time .",
    "vhe telescopes can also detect fainter @xmath0-ray sources if they are more compact , because they can reject more of the cosmic - ray background .",
    "ic443 , @xmath0-cygni , and w44 are also associated with egret sources ( @xcite ) . despite long observations , no significant excesses",
    "were observed , and stringent limits were derived on the vhe flux ( see table  [ snruls ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the upper limits derived by the northern hemisphere telescopes , the cangaroo collaboration has recently reported evidence for tev @xmath0-ray emission from the shell - type snr , sn1006 ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations taken in 1996 and 1997 indicate a statistically significant excess from the northeast rim of the snr shell ( see figure  [ sn1006_tev ] ) .",
    "the position of the excess is consistent with the location of non - thermal x rays detected by the _ asca _",
    "experiment ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this object is confirmed as a tev @xmath0-ray source , it represents the first direct evidence of acceleration of particles to tev energies in the shocks of snrs .",
    "if the egret detections do indicate the presence of @xmath0-rays produced by secondary pion decay , the measured flux can be compared with the vhe upper limits . these vhe upper limits and the egret measurements",
    "are compared to the predicted fluxes from the model of drury et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in figure  [ snrlims_fig ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solid curves are normalized to the integral @xmath7100mev flux detected by egret assuming a source cosmic - ray spectrum of @xmath31 , so they assume that the egret emission is entirely due to cosmic - ray interactions and that the cosmic - ray spectrum at the source has the canonical spectrum . in the cases of @xmath0-cygni , ic443 , and w44",
    ", the whipple upper limits lie a factor of @xmath825 , 10 , and 10 , respectively , below the model extrapolations and require either a spectral break or a differential source spectrum steeper than @xmath32 for @xmath0-cygni and @xmath33 for ic443 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the measured egret spectra , while consistent with a spectral index of about 2 , do not show the flattening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum near 100mev which would be expected if the @xmath0-rays result from secondary pion decay .",
    "gaisser et al . (",
    "1998 ) performed multiwavelength fits to the egret and whipple results and concluded that if the egret detections are truly from the shells of the snrs , the egret data must be dominated at low energies by electron bremsstrahlung radiation , but the source spectrum at high energies must still be relatively steep ( @xmath8e@xmath34 ) to account for the whipple upper limits ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the @xmath7100mev emission results from some other emission mechanism , such as the interactions of high energy electrons accelerated by embedded pulsars or in the snr shocks , the egret results should not be compared to the whipple data . instead , the whipple data must be considered alone in the context of the secondary pion decay models .",
    "this possibility was also investigated by buckley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and is shown by the dashed curves in figure  [ snrlims_fig ] .",
    "the dashed curves represent a conservative estimate of the range of allowable parameter values for the drury et al .",
    "( 1994 ) model , without reference to the egret detections . for this comparison",
    ", there is still room for the models to work in these objects .",
    "however , the upper limits in some ( e.g. , ic443 ) are beginning to strain the limits of the available parameter space .",
    "it will take more sensitive measurements with future telescopes to fully span the allowable parameter space and see if we need to reconsider our assumptions about the sources of cosmic rays within our galaxy .    the tev emission from sn1006 detected by the cangaroo group",
    "also does not require the presence of hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "in fact , the most common explanation for the detected emission is inverse compton scattering of electrons with cosmic microwave background photons ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main arguments for this are that the emission is centered on one of the regions where the synchrotron emission was detected with _",
    "asca _ and the lack of evidence for a nearby molecular cloud needed to boost the tev @xmath0-ray flux to a detectable level . under the assumption that the emission is from inverse compton scattering , tanimori et al .",
    "( 1998a ) have combined their data with the _ asca _ results to derive an estimate of 6.5 @xmath35 2@xmath36 g for the magnetic field within the snr shell .",
    "the observations also provide an upper limit on the acceleration time .",
    "thus , the tev observations provide previously unknown parameters for models of the shock acceleration in snrs .",
    "unfortunately , the possibility of inverse compton emission from the shells of snrs also confuses the issue for using @xmath0-rays as a probe of cosmic - ray acceleration in snrs .",
    "future measurements will need to provide accurate spectra and spatial mapping of the @xmath0-ray emission from snrs in order for the source of the @xmath0-ray emission to be unambiguously resolved .",
    "in recent years , high energy @xmath0-rays have come to play an important role in the study of agns . before the launch of _ cgro _ in 1991 , the only known extragalactic source of high energy @xmath0-rays was 3c273 which had been detected with the cos - b satellite 20 years ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "the egret detector on the _ cgro _ has identified more than 65 agns which emit @xmath0-rays at energies above 100mev ( @xcite ) , and a substantial fraction of those sources which remain unidentified in the egret catalog are likely to be agns as well .",
    "in addition , the whipple observatory @xmath0-ray telescope has discovered three agns which emit at energies above 300gev ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and there are recent detections of two other agns with cherenkov telescopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . during flaring episodes",
    ", the @xmath0-ray emission can greatly exceed the energy output of the agns at all other wavelengths .",
    "thus , any attempt to understand the physics of these objects must include consideration of the @xmath0-ray emission .    all of the agns detected in high energy @xmath0-rays are radio - loud sources with the radio emission arising primarily from a core region rather than from lobes .",
    "these types of agns are often collectively referred to as `` blazars , '' and include bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects , flat spectrum radio - loud quasars ( fsrqs ) , optically violent variables , and superluminal sources .",
    "the emission characteristics of blazars include high polarization at radio and optical wavelengths , rapid variability at all wavelengths , and predominantly non - thermal emission at most wavelengths .",
    "the emission from blazars is believed to arise from relativistic jets oriented at small angles to our line of sight .",
    "if so , the observed radiation will be strongly amplified by relativistic beaming ( @xcite ) .",
    "direct evidence for relativistic beaming of the radio emission comes from very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations of apparent superluminal motion in many blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rapid variability and high luminosities of the detected @xmath0-ray sources imply that the @xmath0-rays are also beamed ( see   [ agnimps ] ) .",
    "there is a growing consensus that blazars are all the same type of object , perhaps differing only in intrinsic luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) or some combination of luminosity and viewing angle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , for this work we will continue the practice of referring to bl lac objects and fsrqs as distinct objects : bl lac objects are those blazars which have optical emission lines with equivalent width @xmath37  and fsrqs are the remaining blazars .",
    "as we will see , this distinction may be important in explaining why only bl lac objects are detected at very high energies .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of blazars appears to consist of two parts .",
    "first , a low energy component exhibits a power per decade distribution that rises smoothly from radio wavelengths up to a broad peak in the range spanning infrared ( ir ) to x - ray wavelengths , depending on the specific blazar type , above which the power output rapidly drops off .",
    "second , a distinct , high energy component , which does not extend smoothly from the low energy component , is often seen .",
    "it typically becomes apparent in the x - ray range and has a peak power output in the @xmath0-ray range between @xmath81mev and 1tev ( e.g. , @xcite ) , again depending on the specific blazar type . when plotted as e@xmath3dn / de ( or equivalently @xmath38f@xmath39 ) the spectral energy distribution shows a two - humped shape , though some objects show evidence of a third component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "though there is no general consensus on the origin of these emission components , it is generally agreed that the low energy component arises from incoherent synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons within the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported most strongly by the high - level , variable polarization observed in these objects at radio and optical wavelengths .",
    "the origin of the high energy emission is a matter of great interest .",
    "there are many variations of the models and here we only briefly mention a few which are most often invoked to explain the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the most popular models at this time are those in which the @xmath0-rays are produced through inverse compton scattering of low energy photons by the same electrons which produce the synchrotron emission at lower energies .",
    "synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which the seed photons for the scattering are the synchrotron photons already present in the jet , must occur at some level in all blazars , but models in which the @xmath0-ray emission arises predominantly from inverse compton scattering of seed photons which arise outside of the jet , either directly from an accretion disk ( dermer , schlickeiser & mastichiadis 1992 ) or after being re - processed in the broad - line region or scattering off thermal plasma ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) , appear to fit the observations satisfactorily as well .",
    "another set of models proposes that the @xmath0-rays are produced by proton - initiated cascades ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as we will show in  [ agnimps ]",
    ", the @xmath0-ray observations strain both types of models , but do not , at present , rule any out .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the status of vhe observations and the emission characteristics of the detected objects (  [ vhestat ] ) , the results of multi - wavelength campaigns on the detected objects (  [ multi ] ) which are the best probe of the physics of blazars , and finally briefly discuss some of the implications of these observations on our understanding of the physics of the blazars and on the models which purport to explain them .",
    "the bl lac object markarian421 ( mrk421 , @xmath40 ) was detected as the first extragalactic source of vhe @xmath0-rays in 1992 using the whipple observatory @xmath0-ray telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "a two - dimensional image of the emission from mrk421 is shown in figure  [ m4 - 2d - fig ] .",
    "although mrk421 had previously been part of an active program of observing extragalactic sources ( @xcite ) by the whipple collaboration , the observations which led to the detection of mrk421 at tev energies were initiated in response to the detection of several agn by the egret experiment .",
    "the initial detection indicated a 6@xmath15 excess and the flux above 500gev was approximately 30% of the flux of the crab nebula at those energies .",
    "mrk421 has been confirmed as a source of vhe @xmath0-rays by the hegra collaboration ( @xcite ) , the telescope array project ( @xcite ) , and the shalon telescope ( @xcite ) and , as discussed in  [ multi ] below , multi - wavelength correlations have confirmed that the vhe source is indeed mrk421 and not some other object .    with the successful detection of mrk421 ,",
    "the whipple collaboration initiated a search for vhe emission from several other blazar - type agns , concentrating at first on those objects detected by egret , but also spending a substantial amount of time observing radio - loud blazars which were not detected by egret .",
    "this broad approach led to the detection of the bl lac object mrk501 ( @xmath41 ) by the whipple collaboration in 1995 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a two - dimensional map of the vhe emission from mrk501 is shown in figure  [ m5 - 2d - fig ] . because mrk501 had not been detected as a significant source of @xmath0-rays by egret , this was the first object to be discovered as a @xmath0-ray source from the ground .",
    "hence , vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy was established as a legitimate channel of astronomical investigations in its own right , not just an adjunct of high energy observations from space .",
    "the flux of mrk501 during 1995 was , on average , 10% of the vhe flux of the crab nebula , making it the weakest detected source of vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "mrk501 was confirmed as a source of vhe @xmath0-rays in 1996 by the hegra telescopes ( @xcite ) , the cat telescope ( @xcite ) , the telescope array project ( @xcite ) , and tactic ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the confirmed detections of mrk421 and mrk501 , three other objects have recently been reported as sources of vhe @xmath0-rays , but remain to be verified by detections from independent @xmath0-ray telescopes . the bl lac object 1es2344 + 514 ( @xmath42 )",
    "was detected at energies about 350gev by the whipple observatory in 1995 ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the emission comes from a single night , december 20 , in which a flux of approximately half that of the crab nebula was detected with a significance of 6@xmath15 .",
    "other observations during that year revealed an excess of 4@xmath15 ; subsequent observations have yielded no significant signal .",
    "1es2344 + 514 is not detected by egret ( @xcite ) so if this detection is confirmed it is another instance of a @xmath0-ray source being first detected by a ground - based telescope .",
    "pks2155 - 304 ( @xmath43 ) , often considered the archetypical x - ray selected bl lac object , was detected at energies above 300gev at the 7@xmath15 level by combining observations from 1996 and 1997 by the durham group ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flux was approximately 40% of the vhe flux of the crab nebula and corresponded to an active x - ray emission period .",
    "pks2155 - 304 is an egret source with an average flux at @xmath44mev comparable to that of mrk421 .",
    "finally , the bl lac object 3c66a ( @xmath45 ) has been reported as a source of @xmath7900gev @xmath0-rays based on a 5@xmath15 excess seen in observations in 1996 by @xmath0-ray telescopes at the crimean astrophysical observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average flux during these observations was approximately 120% of the flux of the crab nebula at these energies .",
    "3c66a is an egret source ( @xcite ) .",
    "extreme variability on time - scales from minutes to years is the most distinctive feature of the vhe emission from these bl lac objects .",
    "variability in the emission is a surprising feature in some respects because it implies a small emission region .",
    "if low energy photons ( e.g. , infrared , optical , and ultraviolet ) are produced in the same region , the vhe photons would pair produce with these photons and would not escape .",
    "also , if the variability occurs near the base of the jet , there is likely to be considerable ambient radiation present which can attenuate the @xmath0-ray signal .",
    "this opacity problem is reduced considerably if the emission is beamed toward us ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and this has been one of the main arguments for @xmath0-ray beaming in these objects ( see  [ agnimps ] ) .    the first clear detection of flaring activity in the vhe emission of an agn came in 1994 observations of mrk421 by the whipple collaboration ( @xcite ) where a 10-fold increase in the flux , from an average level that year of approximately 15% of the crab flux to approximately 150% of the crab flux , was observed .",
    "subsequent analysis of mrk 421 data indicated evidence for less prominent episodes of variability during 1992 and 1993 as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggested that variability could be present on a fairly frequent basis in the vhe emission . in order to characterize this variability , the whipple collaboration began systematic monitoring of mrk421 in 1995 which continues to the present day .",
    "the observations of mrk421 in 1995 , shown in figure  [ m4_1995_lc ] , revealed several distinct episodes of flaring activity , like in previous observations , but , perhaps more importantly , indicated that the vhe emission from mrk421 was best characterized by a succession of day - scale or shorter flares with a baseline emission level below the sensitivity limit of the whipple detector ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time - scale of the flaring is derived from the fact that , for the most part , the flux levels measured each night varied fairly randomly with no evidence of a smooth pattern .",
    "thus , though no significant intra - night variability was discerned in these observations , it seemed clear that it could occur .",
    "the hypothesis that the vhe emission of mrk421 could flare on sub - day time - scales was borne out in spectacular fashion in 1996 , with the observations of two flares by the whipple collaboration ( figure  [ m4_fastvars ] ; @xcite ) . in the first flare ,",
    "observed on may 7 , the flux increased monotonically during the course of @xmath82 hours of observations , beginning at a rate twice as high as any previously observed flare and reaching a counting rate @xmath4610 times the rate from the crab , at which point observations had to stop because of moonrise .",
    "this flux is the highest observed from any vhe source to date .",
    "the doubling time of the flare was @xmath81 hour .",
    "follow - up observations on may 8 showed that the flux had dropped to a flux level of @xmath4630% of the crab nebula flux , implying a decay time - scale of @xmath101 day .",
    "the second flare , observed on may 15 , although weaker was remarkable for its very short duration : the entire flare lasted approximately 30 minutes with a doubling and decay time of less than 15 minutes .",
    "_ these two flares are the fastest time - scale variability , by far , seen from any blazar at any @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "_    systematic observations of mrk501 sensitive to day - scale flares have been conducted since 1995 with the whipple observatory @xmath0-ray telescope ( @xcite ) and since 1997 with the telescopes of the hegra ( @xcite ) , cat ( @xcite ) , and telescope array ( @xcite ) collaborations .",
    "the results of these observations indicate a wide range of emission levels ( figure  [ m5 - 4yr - fig ] ) and some very interesting similarities and differences with the vhe emission from mrk421 .",
    "the observations in 1995 indicate a flux which is constant , with the exception of one night , mjd 49920 , when the flux was approximately 4.6@xmath15 above the average ( approximately 5 times the flux during the remainder of the season ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations in 1996 by the whipple observatory show that the average flux of mrk501 had increased to approximately 20% of the crab nebula flux above 300gev indicating a two - fold increase in the average flux over the 1995 observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "hegra observations indicated an average flux of approximately 30% of the crab flux above 1.5tev , perhaps indicating a harder emission spectrum than that of the crab nebula .",
    "the whipple observations show no clear flaring episodes but the probability that the average monthly flux levels are drawn from a distribution with a constant flux level is 3.6@xmath4710@xmath48 , clearly indicating that the emission is varying on at least month - scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is no significant evidence for day - scale variations within each month in 1996 .    in 1997 , the vhe emission from mrk501 changed dramatically . after being the weakest known source in the vhe sky in 1995 and 1996 , it became the brightest , with an average flux greater than that of the crab nebula ( whereas previous observations had never revealed a flux @xmath750% of the crab flux ) .",
    "also , the amount of day - scale flaring increased and , for the first time , significant hour - scale variations were seen .",
    "two clear episodes of hour - scale variability were detected with the whipple observatory telescope ( figure  [ m5_hourly ] ) and a search for intraday variability revealed several other nights which , considered alone , would not have been considered significant but , when combined , indicated frequent intra - day variability which was just below the sensitivity of the whipple telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of data from the hegra ( @xcite ) and telescope array ( @xcite ) projects revealed no statistically significant intra - night variations , but the two nights in the hegra data with the smallest statistical probability of having constant emission are the same nights seen to have significant variability in the whipple data .",
    "perhaps the most important aspect of the observations of mrk501 in 1997 was that , for the first time , cherenkov telescopes other than the whipple telescope consistently detected a significant excess from mrk501 on a nightly time - scale .",
    "this permitted more complete vhe light - curves to be obtained ( which it is expected will eventually lead to a better understanding of the vhe emission from blazars ) and also provided confirmation that different vhe telescopes could obtain consistent results from a variable source ( see figure  [ m5_1997_lc ] ) .",
    "in addition to the establishment of the flaring itself , the telescope array collaboration performed a periodicity search with their vhe observations of mrk501 in 1997 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they show evidence for a quasi - periodic signal in the data which has a period of approximately 12.7 days .",
    "this is disturbingly close to half the lunar cycle .",
    "if real this would be an extraordinary result , given the very short time - scale of the quasi - periodicity .",
    "the only published results on observations of mrk501 in 1998 are those of the whipple observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average emission level was approximately 30% of the crab flux",
    "but there was considerably more variability in the emission than in 1996 or 1995 .",
    "two distinct , very high flux flares were observed , one with the highest flux ( approximately 5 times the crab flux ) ever observed from mrk501 with the whipple telescope .",
    "the monthly average flux was also variable , with three months showing emission levels similar to the 1995 flux , approximately 10% of the crab nebula .",
    "a natural question to ask about the variability in mrk501 is whether the degree of variability seen changes as a function of the mean flux level .",
    "that is , whether mrk501 is really more variable when its average flux is higher or whether it is an artifact of the telescopes being more sensitive to variations when the average flux is higher ? to test this , quinn et al .",
    "( 1999 ) performed simulations to see if the day - scale variability observed with the whipple telescope in 1997 ( when the average vhe flux was 1.3 times that of the crab ) would have been detectable in 1996 and 1995 ( when the average vhe flux was 20% and 10% that of the crab , respectively ) and also tested whether the month - scale variations in 1997 and 1996 would have been detectable in 1995 .",
    "their simulations indicate that the day - scale flaring in 1997 would have been detectable in the 1996 data , but not the 1995 data , and the month - scale variations in 1996 would have been detectable in 1995 , while the 1997 month - scale variations would not have been detectable .",
    "thus , it appears that the higher state emission levels have different variability characteristics than the lower emission levels .",
    "the other unconfirmed sources are , if they are indeed sources , also variable emitters of vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "1es2344 + 514 was only detected with high statistical significance on one night , but has never been detected since , with flux limits of approximately 10% of the crab flux ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "pks2155 - 304 has also been claimed to be variable ( @xcite ) , although the statistical probability that the emission is constant is not quoted .",
    "finally , 3c66a must be variable , or else observations with the whipple observatory telescope ( @xcite ) and the hegra telescope ( @xcite ) would have easily detected this object at the flux level quoted by the crimean group .",
    "the high flux vhe emission from mrk421 and mrk501 has permitted detailed spectra to be extracted .",
    "accurate measurements of the vhe spectrum are important for a variety of reasons .",
    "first , the shape of the high energy spectrum is a key input parameter of agn emission models , particularly as it relates to the mev - gev measurements by egret .",
    "second , how the spectrum varies with flux , compared to longer wavelength observations provide further emission model tests .",
    "third , spectral features , such as breaks or cut offs , can indicate changes in the primary particle distribution or absorption of the @xmath0-rays via pair - production with low energy photons at the source or in intergalactic space ( see  [ ebl ] ) .    for mrk421 , the only detailed spectra published at this time come from observations of high state emission with the whipple observatory telescope ( figure  [ m4_m5_whip_spect ] ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the spectra obtained from observations of flares on 1996 may 7 and 15 and observations of high state emission taken at large zenith angles in 1995 june indicate that , within the statistical uncertainties , the spectra are all consistent with a simple power law spectrum : @xmath49 ( @xcite ) . when combined , these three data sets are consistent with a simple power law spectrum for mrk421 of the form ( @xcite ) @xmath50 where e is in tev .",
    "observations of mrk421 in 1997 and 1998 with the hegra system of cherenkov telescopes reveal a significantly different spectrum ( @xcite ) @xmath51 than observed with the whipple telescope .",
    "the emission level for the hegra observations was approximately 0.5 times the crab flux , much lower than the fluxes ( 1  10 times the crab flux ) used in the whipple observations .",
    "this may indicate that the spectrum in mrk421 becomes softer with decreasing flux . however , hegra observations show no evidence of variability between observations at fluxes above the crab flux and those between one - sixth and one - half the crab flux and the whipple results show no variations in spectral index despite using observations spanning a 10-fold range of fluxes .",
    "further studies may help resolve these differences .    as with the studies of the variability of its vhe flux , the high state emission detected from mrk501 in 1997 allowed detailed spectra to be derived by several experiments , permitting studies of the time - dependence of the spectra and providing all - important cross - checks of the methods used to derive energy spectra .",
    "because of the rapid variability of the emission , again the normalization of the spectra are not of fundamental importance , except perhaps in the context of multi - wavelength studies which are discussed in  [ multi ] below .",
    "the most detailed energy spectra published at this time come from whipple observations between 250gev and 12tev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and hegra data spanning 500gev to 20tev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the telescope array collaboration has also derived a spectrum over a slightly narrower energy range ( 600gev to 6.5tev ) ( @xcite ) . a search for variability in",
    "the spectrum revealed no significant changes in spectrum with flux or time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , allowing large data sets to be combined to derive very detailed energy spectra spanning large ranges in energy .",
    "the spectra derived by whipple and hegra deviate significantly from a simple power law . for whipple ,",
    "the @xmath52 probability that a power law is consistent with the measured spectrum is @xmath53 .",
    "this is the first significant deviation from a power law seen in any vhe @xmath0-ray source and any blazar at energies above 10mev .",
    "the whipple spectrum is : @xmath54 and the hegra spectrum is : @xmath55\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where e is in units of tev .",
    "the form of the curvature term in the spectra has no physical significance as the energy resolution of the experiments is not sufficient to resolve particular spectral models .",
    "the whipple spectral form is simply a polynomial expansion in loge v. log(dn / de ) space .",
    "the hegra form was chosen presumably because attenuation of the vhe @xmath0-rays by pair - production with background ir photons could produce an exponential cut - off .",
    "in fact , the whipple and hegra data are completely consistent with each other as shown in figure  [ m5_spectra ] .",
    "the telescope array collaboration derived a spectrum which is well fit by a simple power law ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the data from this spectrum are also consistent with the whipple and hegra spectra .",
    "some of the most exciting results on vhe @xmath0-ray sources have come through observations where several telescopes operating at different wavelengths simultaneously monitor the activity in a blazar .",
    "these multi - wavelength campaigns have involved the larger astronomical community in the study of vhe sources and served the subsidiary purpose of confirming the source identifications of the vhe @xmath0-ray emitting blazars .",
    "the first evidence of correlated variability between vhe @xmath0-rays and lower energy emission came from a multi - wavelength campaign on mrk421 in 1994 april / may ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations were conducted with the whipple telescope , egret , the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ) in x rays , the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) , the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) , the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in the mm waveband , and the university of michigan 26-m radio telescope ( umrao ) in the 4.8  14.5ghz frequency range .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray , _ asca _ , and egret observations are shown in figure  [ m4_lc_1994 ] .",
    "the vhe observations reveal the rising edge of a flare that developed over approximately 4 days with the peak flux detected on may 15 ( ut ) being approximately 9 times the mean flux measured during that observing season and approximately 1.4 times the flux of the crab nebula .",
    "observations had to be halted after may 15 because the phase of the moon precluded further observations .",
    "observations taken with _",
    "asca _ on may 16/17 ( @xcite , 1996 ) indicated a flux approximately 20 times the quiescent x - ray flux of mrk421 , and the time coincidence between the two observations of unprecedented high states is the basis for the claim of a correlation in this campaign .",
    "interestingly , egret observations taken between 1997 may 10 and 17 did not detect the strong day - scale variability seen in vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "the average flux during this period was approximately twice the average flux measured in 1994 april , so there is some evidence of a higher emission state , but it is not significant enough to claim a correlation . the observations at uv , ir , mm , and radio wavelengths showed no evidence of variability during this period .",
    "because of the offset in time of the observations between the vhe @xmath0-rays and the x rays , detailed comparisons of the variability in those wavebands are not possible .    spurred by this result , another multiwavelength campaign was organized in 1995 to better measure the multiwavelength properties of mrk421 .",
    "this campaign revealed , for the first time , correlations between vhe @xmath0-rays and x rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations were conducted between april 20 and may 5 with the whipple telescope , egret , _ asca _ , the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) , an optical telescope , an optical polarimeter , and umrao .",
    "observations with egret did not result in a detection of mrk421 .",
    "the 2@xmath15 flux upper limit for e@xmath7100mev is @xmath57 @xmath13 s@xmath14 , somewhat below the level detected in 1994 .",
    "the light curves for some of these observations are shown in figure  [ m4_multi_95 ] .",
    "the optical data have the contribution from the host galaxy of mrk421 subtracted off . as in the 1994 multiwavelength campaign",
    ", mrk421 underwent a large amplitude flare in vhe @xmath0-rays during the observations .",
    "the flare is also clearly seen in the _ asca _ and _ euve _ observations .",
    "there is some evidence for correlated variability in the optical flux and polarization , but the statistics are not good enough to be confident about claiming such an association .",
    "the x rays and vhe @xmath0-rays appear to vary together , limited to the one day resolution of the vhe observations , and the amplitude of the flaring is similar , @xmath8400% difference between the peak flux and that at the end of the observations .",
    "the euve and optical data ( assuming it also is correlated ) are consistent with the flare being delayed by approximately 1 day relative to the x rays and vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "the amplitude of the flare also decreases with decreasing energy .",
    "the xuv flux varies by @xmath8200% during the observations and the optical flux varies by about 20% .",
    "the b - band percent polarization varies by nearly a factor of two in the observations .",
    "the observations of mrk421 in 1994 and 1995 were clearly undersampled , limiting the conclusions that could be drawn concerning correlations between wavelengths and emission models .",
    "two multiwavelength campaigns organized in 1998 attempted to improve these measurements through more dense observations in x rays and vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "improvement in the vhe measurements came about through longer vhe exposures with individual telescopes , to search for hour - scale variations , and coordination of vhe observations between cat , hegra , and whipple .",
    "thus , light curves of 12  16 hours could in principle be achieved , allowing much more detailed measurements of the vhe emission .",
    "these observations yielded immediate improvements in the measurements of flaring activity and correlations between vhe @xmath0-rays and x rays .",
    "the first campaign , conducted in late 1998 april , was centered at x - ray wavelengths on observations with the _ bepposax _ satellite and established the first hour - scale correlations between x rays and @xmath0-rays in a blazar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lightcurve for the observations by _ bepposax _ in three x - ray bands and whipple above 2tev is shown in figure  [ m4_1998_sax_lc ] .",
    "the vhe threshold here is higher than typical of whipple data because observations were taken at a wide range of elevations , causing the energy threshold and sensitivity to vary with time .",
    "these effects were corrected in the light curve through the use of simulations and analysis cuts to normalize the collection area and energy threshold .",
    "thus , the vhe lightcurve rate variations are intrinsic .",
    "as figure  [ m4_1998_sax_lc ] shows , a flare is clearly detected in x rays and tev @xmath0-rays on the first day of observations .",
    "the peaks in the lightcurves occur at the same time , within 1 hour , but the fall off in the x - ray flux is considerably slower than the tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "also , the tev @xmath0-rays have a larger variability amplitude ( @xmath84-fold ratio between average and peak ) than the x rays ( @xmath82-fold ) . both the faster vhe flux decrease and the larger amplitude variability have not been seen previously in mrk421 .",
    "these observations provide the first clear indication that x rays and vhe @xmath0-rays may not be completely correlated on all time - scales .",
    "the second multiwavelength campaign started in late 1998 april , immediately after the observations discussed above , and was centered around a seven day continuous observation of mrk421 with _",
    "asca _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the light curves for the x - ray observations and vhe observations by whipple , cat , and hegra are shown in figure  [ m4_1998_asca_lc ] . had these observations been conducted as in 1994 and 1995 , with short x - ray exposures and just whipple observations , the results would have shown nothing new : similar variability scale between the x rays and vhe @xmath0-rays and some sub - dayscale x - ray variability with amplitude too low to be resolved with the whipple observations . instead , the x - ray observations reveal the complete cycle of about 10 flares , the first time this has been done for mrk421 . also , these observations seem to confirm the supposition of buckley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the vhe emission from mrk421 is primarily the result of flares , with little steady emission evident .",
    "finally , the combination of vhe data from these telescopes confirms the sub - day - scale correlations seen in the whipple/_bepposax _ observations .",
    "detailed comparisons of the vhe @xmath0-ray and x - ray data will require more sophisticated normalization of the vhe data ( e.g. , to common threshold energies ) and investigation of systematics in the measures of variability , but the data hold the promise of significantly advancing our study of vhe - emitting @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "they also clearly demonstrate the benefits of operating multiple vhe @xmath0-ray installations in understanding the nature of variable sources .",
    "the first multi - wavelength observations of mrk501 which included vhe observations were conducted in 1996 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were conducted with the whipple telescope , egret , _ asca _ , and an optical telescope .",
    "the light curve for these observations is shown in figure  [ m5_lc_1996 ] .",
    "the observations were too undersampled , or insensitive in the case of egret , to clearly establish any correlations , but these observations have two very important results .",
    "first , follow up observations in 1996 may established the first detection of mrk501 by egret , with a marginal significance of 4.0@xmath15 above 100mev but a significance of 5.2@xmath15 above 500mev indicating a hard photon spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the claim of a 3.5@xmath15 detection by egret during a small part of the multiwavelength campaign ( the region between the dashed lines in figure  [ m5_lc_1996 ] ) seems speculative , given the lack of any increased activity in other wavebands during that period .",
    "second , the observations established a baseline spectral energy distribution for mrk501 during a relatively low emission state which could be compared to observations of the high state emission in 1997 ( see below for discussion of spectral energy distributions ) .",
    "multiwavelength observations of mrk501 during its high emission state in 1997 revealed , for the first time , clear correlations between its vhe @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission ( @xcite ) . observations were conducted with whipple ( nightly , from april 7 - 19 ) , egret and oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ) on _ cgro _ ( april 9  15 ) , _ bepposax _ ( april 7 , 11 , 16 ) , _ rxte _ ( twice nightly april 3  16 ) , and the whipple observatory 1.2-m optical telescope ( nightly , april 7  15 ) .",
    "the optical and x - ray observations were serendipitously scheduled at this time , and the _ cgro _ observations were a public target of opportunity observation initiated in response to the high vhe emission state .",

    "[ m5_1997_mw_lc]e , _ dashed line _ ) to indicate the significant ( @xmath5810% ) increase in flux between march and april .",
    "an 11 day rise and fall in flux is evident in the vhe and x - ray wavebands , with peaks on april 13 and 16 .",
    "150kev flux detected by osse also increases between april 9 and 15 , with a peak on april 13 .",
    "the optical data may show a correlated rise , but the variation is small ( at most 6% ) .",
    "subtraction of the galaxy light contribution will increase the amplitude of this variation , but it should still remain lower than in x rays , given that the r - band contribution of the galaxy light is @xmath875% ( @xcite ) and the u - band contribution should be much less .",
    "egret observations indicated an excess of 1.5@xmath15 , not a significant detection .",
    "the ratio of the fluxes between april 13 and april 9 are 4.2 , 2.6 , 2.3 , and 2.1 for the vhe @xmath0-ray , osse , _ rxte _ , 15  25kev , and _ rxte _ 2  10kev emission , respectively .    the results of this campaign show that for mrk501 , like mrk421 , the vhe @xmath0-rays and the soft x rays vary together and the variability in the synchrotron emission increases with increasing energy .",
    "however , osse has never detected mrk421 despite several observations ( @xcite ) , while the mrk501 detection had the highest 50 ",
    "150kev flux ever detected by osse from a blazar .",
    "a likely explanation of the osse detection is that the synchrotron emission in mrk501 extends to 100kev , compared with the @xmath81kev cutoff seen in mrk421 .",
    "this explanation was first confirmed by the observations with _ bepposax _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the day scale variations for mrk501 are larger in @xmath0-rays than in x rays , unlike mrk421 .",
    "so , despite the similarity of mrk421 and mrk501 in some respects , these multi - wavelength campaigns are beginning to reveal differences in the two objects .    in these short multi - wavelength campaigns",
    ", there appears to be a correlation between the x rays and vhe @xmath0-rays . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether this is always true , or only during certain situations .",
    "an attempt to answer this question has been made by the hegra collaboration by comparing their observations of mrk501 above 500gev to those by the _",
    "rxte _ all - sky monitor , measuring 2  12kev photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "a cross - correlation analysis of the daily average flux measured by the all - sky monitor with the daily average flux measured by hegra reveals a peak in the correlation function at @xmath59 day .",
    "however , the peak in the cross - correlation function is only @xmath80.4 and the significance of the peak is only 2@xmath15  3@xmath15 . whether this indicates that the x - ray / tev correlation is _ not _ present is unclear",
    "because the asm data have large statistical and significant systematic uncertainties for day - scale measurements of this relatively dim x - ray source ( i.e. , compared to the x - ray binaries the asm was designed to monitor ) . also ,",
    "because hegra sits on the falling edge of the high energy spectrum and the asm sits ( for mrk501 in 1997 ) on the rising edge of the synchrotron spectrum , it is possible that the emission detected by these two instruments will not be completely correlated , particularly for day - scale variations .",
    "comparison of longer - term variability between the measurements might help resolve such issues .",
    "figure  [ seds_fig ] shows the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , expressed as power per logarithmic bandwidth , for mrk421 and mrk501 derived from contemporaneous multi - wavelength observations and an average of non - contemporaneous archival measurements .",
    "both have a peak in the synchrotron emission at x - ray frequencies , as is typical of x - ray selected bl lac objects , and a high energy peak whose exact location is unknown but must lie in the 10  250gev range .",
    "both the synchrotron and high energy peak are similar in power output , unlike the egret - detected flat - spectrum radio quasars which can have high energy peaks well above the synchrotron peaks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , during flaring episodes , the x - ray spectrum in both objects tends to harden significantly ( @xcite , 1999 ; @xcite ) while the vhe spectrum is not observed to change .",
    "the seds of the two sources do , however , exhibit important differences .",
    "most prominent among these is that the combination of contemporaneous _ rxte _ and osse observations of mrk501 in 1997 clearly confirm the initial measurements of pian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the synchrotron spectrum extended well - beyond the @xmath81kev typical of x - ray selected bl lac objects .",
    "they also establish that the peak power output of the synchrotron emission occurs at @xmath8100kev .",
    "this is in contrast to the 1996 observations of mrk501 reported by kataoka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where the synchrotron power peak is at @xmath82kev . for mrk421",
    ", the x - ray spectral peak does shift to higher energies during flaring activity , but the changes are much smaller than in mrk501 , and the peak was never observed to extend beyond @xmath81kev .",
    "this peak is followed by a sharp cutoff which produces a deficit in the osse range , preventing the detection of mrk421 by this instrument .    whether the shift in the location of the synchrotron peak for mrk501 is also accompanied by a shift in the onset of the @xmath0-ray emission to higher energies",
    "is not clear .",
    "any increase in the mev - gev flux in 1997 was not as great as at tev energies , or egret would have easily detected mrk501 .",
    "but , because the sensitivity of egret in 1997 was substantially poorer than in 1996 , a shift in the onset of the spectrum or a flux variation that increases with increasing energy could explain the non - detection by egret .",
    "the fact that the vhe spectrum of mrk501 is harder than that of mrk421 below @xmath81tev ( see figure  [ m4_m5_whip_spect ] ) may also indicate that the high energy peak of mrk501 is shifted to slightly higher energies .",
    "however , it could also simply indicate a slower fall off in the progenitor particle spectrum above the peak power output .",
    "a second difference in the spectral energy distributions for these two objects is that the power output for mrk501 in the vhe range can be considerably less than in x rays when it is in a low emission state .",
    "in contrast , mrk421 seems to maintain a similar output at x - ray and @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "these differences are illustrated in table  [ sed_ratios ] which gives the ratio of contemporaneously measured fluxes for x rays and @xmath0-rays for these two objects .",
    "whether the difference in power output for mrk501 reflects a change of the energy at which the peak in the high energy spectrum occurs or something related to the flaring process is not clear , due to the poor spectral measurements in the low emission states and the lack of coverage of the peak region of the spectrum .",
    "however , the lack of spectral variability in @xmath0-rays argues against a significant short - term shift of the @xmath0-ray spectral peak .",

    "the @xmath7100mev fluxes are near ( mrk 421 , mrk 501 ) or below ( 1es2344 + 514 ) the egret sensitivity limit , meaning that the @xmath0-ray power output does not peak in that energy range as it does for many of the egret - detected agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , vhe observations already augment the catalog of @xmath0-ray sources compiled by space - borne telescopes .",
    "finally , all three of the whipple - detected bl lac objects are x - ray selected bl lac objects ( xbls ) .",
    "the extension of the synchrotron spectra to x - ray energies in xbls implies that they produce high energy electrons , making them good candidates for vhe emission if the vhe @xmath0-rays are produced via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of these same electrons .",
    "egret s tendency to detect more radio - selected bl lac objects ( rbls ) than xbls ( @xcite ) also supports this tenet because rbls would be expected to have spectra which peak in the mev - gev range ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bl lac objects in general have been suggested as better candidates for vhe emission than other blazars because the absence of optical emission lines in bl lac objects may indicate less vhe - absorbing radiation near the emission region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other two objects detected at vhe energies , pks2155 - 304 and 3c66a , are similar in some respects to the whipple sources .",

    "in addition , both pks2155 - 304 and 3c66a are at much higher redshifts than the whipple sources , implying quite low ir backgrounds . thus ,",

    "for example , the rapid variability indicates either very low accretion rates and photon densities near the nucleus ( celotti , fabian & rees 1998 ) or , conversely , requires the @xmath0-ray emission region to be located relatively far from the nucleus to escape the photon fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the observations have helped resolve the nature of the differences between rbls and xbls .",
    "based on their smaller numbers and higher luminosities , maraschi et al .",
    "( 1986 ) proposed that rbls were the same as xbls but with jets aligned more closely with our line of sight .",
    "however , the rapid variability and tev extent of the xbl emission point to the differences between the two sub - classes being more fundamental , as originally proposed by padovani & giommi ( 1994 ) : the xbls have higher maximum electron energies and lower intrinsic luminosities .",
    "simultaneous measurements of the synchrotron and vhe @xmath0-ray spectra also constrain the magnetic field strength ( @xmath66 ) and doppler factor ( @xmath67 ) of the jet . if the correlation between the vhe @xmath0-rays and optical / uv photons observed in 1995 from mrk 421",
    "indicates both sets of photons are produced in the same region of the jet , @xmath68 is required for the vhe photons to escape significant pair - production losses ( @xcite ) . if the ssc mechanism produces the vhe @xmath0-rays , @xmath69 and @xmath70 g for mrk 421 ( @xcite ; tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 ; @xcite ) and @xmath71 and @xmath72 g for mrk 501 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to match the variability time - scales of the correlated emission , proton models which utilize synchrotron cooling as",
    "the primary means for proton energy losses require magnetic fields of @xmath73 g for @xmath74 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mrk 421 values of @xmath67 and @xmath66 are extreme for blazars , but they are still within allowable ranges and are consistent with the extreme variability of mrk 421 .    in addition , the vhe observations have constrained the types of models that are likely to produce the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "for instance , the correlation of the x - ray and the vhe flares is consistent with ic models where the same population of electrons radiate the x rays and @xmath0-rays .",
    "the absence of flaring at egret energies may also follow in this context ( @xcite ) because the lower energy electrons which produce the @xmath0-rays in the egret range radiate away their energy more slowly than the higher energy electrons which produce the vhe emission",
    ". the mev - gev emission could then be the superposition of many flare events and would therefore show little or no short - term variation .    in the mechanism of sikora et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which produces @xmath0-rays through the comptonization of external photons , the external photons must have energies @xmath100.1ev ( in the ir band ) to avoid significant attenuation of the vhe @xmath0-rays by pair production .",
    "sikora et al .",
    "( 1994 ) point out that there is little direct observational evidence of such an ir component in bl lac objects , but the existence of such a field has been predicted as a product of accretion in agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "models which produce the @xmath0-ray emission from proton progenitors through @xmath75 cascades originating close to the base of the agn jet have great difficulty explaining the tev emission observed in mrk421 because the high densities of unbeamed photons near the nucleus , such as the accretion disk or the broad line region , required to initiate the cascades cause high pair opacities to tev @xmath0-rays ( coppi , kartje & knigl 1993 ) .",
    "such models also predict that the radius at which the optical depth for @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production drops below unity increases with increasing @xmath0-ray energy ( @xcite ) and therefore the vhe @xmath0-rays should vary either later or more slowly than the mev - gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "this is in contradiction to the observations of mrk421 in both 1994 ( @xcite ) and 1995 ( @xcite ) .      in traversing intergalactic distances",
    ", @xmath0-rays may be absorbed by photon - photon pair production ( @xmath76 ) on background photon fields if the center of mass energy of the photon - photon system exceeds twice the rest energy of the electron ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cross - section for this process peaks when @xmath77 where e@xmath78 is the energy of the @xmath0-ray , @xmath79 is the energy of the low energy photon , @xmath80 is the collision angle between the two photons , @xmath81 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath82 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "thus , for photons of energy near 1tev , head - on collisions with photons of @xmath80.5ev have the highest cross - section , though a broad range of optical - to - ir wavelengths can be important absorbers because the cross - section for pair production is rather broad in energy and spectral features in the extragalactic background density can make certain wavebands more important than the cross - section alone would indicate .",
    "the presence of extragalactic background light ( ebl ) limits the distance to which vhe @xmath0-ray telescopes can detect sources .",
    "this has been put forth as an explanation of the lack of detection of many of the egret - detected agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as discussed above .",
    "the difficulty in understanding the effect of the ebl on the opacity of the universe to vhe @xmath0-rays is that not much is known about the spectrum of the ebl at present , nor how it developed over time .",
    "star formation is expected to be a major contributor to the ebl ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , with star formation contributing mainly at short wavelengths ( 1  15@xmath36 m ) and dust absorption and re - emission contributing at longer wavelengths ( 15  50@xmath36 m ) .",
    "so , measurements of the ebl spectrum can serve as important tracers of the history of the formation of stars and galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "other , more exotic processes , such as pre - galactic star formation and some dark matter candidates , might also contribute distinctive features to the ebl ( e.g. , @xcite , 1991 ) .",
    "thus , measurements of the ebl have the potential to provide a wealth of information about several important topics in astrophysics .",
    "experiments that attempt to measure the ebl by directly detecting optical - ir photons , such as the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) , are plagued by foreground sources of ir radiation . emitted and scattered light from interplanetary dust , emission from unresolved stellar components in the galaxy , and dust emission from the interstellar medium",
    "are all significantly more intense than the ebl and must be carefully modelled and subtracted to derive estimates of the ebl .",
    "currently , ebl detections are available only at 140@xmath36 m and 240@xmath36 m ( @xcite ) .",
    "tentative detections at 3.5@xmath36 m ( @xcite ) and 400  1000@xmath36 m ( @xcite ) have also been reported .    because vhe @xmath0-rays are attenuated most by optical - ir photons , measurements of the spectra of agns",
    "provide an indirect means of investigating the ebl that is not affected by local sources of ir radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the signs of ebl absorption can be cutoffs , but also simple alterations of the spectral index ( e.g. , @xcite ) , depending on the spectral shape of the ebl and the distance to the source . like direct measurements of the ebl , this technique has difficulties to overcome .",
    "for instance , it requires some knowledge of or assumptions about the intrinsic spectrum and flux normalization of the agns or the ebl .",
    "also , the agns themselves produce dense radiation fields which can absorb vhe @xmath0-rays at the source and thereby mimic the effects of the intergalactic ebl attenuation .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "the accurate measurement of vhe spectra with no obvious spectral cut - offs from just the two confirmed vhe - emitting agns , mrk421 and mrk501 ( see  [ vhestat ] ) , has permitted stringent limits to be set on the density of the ebl over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "these limits have been derived from two approaches : ( 1 ) assuming a limit to the hardness of the intrinsic spectrum of the agns and deriving limits which assume very little about the ebl spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and ( 2 ) assuming some shape for the ebl spectrum , based on theoretical or phenomenological modelling of the ebl , and adjusting the normalization of the ebl density to match the measured vhe spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter can be more stringent , but are necessarily more model - dependent .",
    "the limits from these indirect methods and from the direct measurements of ebl photons are summarized in figure  [ ir - lims ] . at some wavelengths ,",
    "the tev limits represent a 50-fold improvement over the limits from dirbe .",
    "these limits are currently well above the predicted density for the ebl from normal galaxy formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but they have provided constraints on a variety of more exotic mechanisms for sources of the ebl ( e.g. , @xcite ) . they also show that ebl attenuation alone can not explain the lack of detection of egret sources with nearby redshifts at vhe energies , as the optical depth for pair - production does not reach 1 for the stringent limits of biller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) until beyond a redshift of @xmath83 ( see figure  [ irdist_lim ] ) . with the detection or more agns , particularly at higher redshift , and improvements in our understanding of the emission and absorption processes in agns , vhe measurements have the potential to set very restrictive limits on the ebl density , and perhaps eventually detect it .",
    "although the @xmath0-ray burst phenomenon is usually associated with energies of 100 kev to 1 mev ( hard x rays to low energy @xmath0-rays ) results from egret show that there is a component at high energies and thus the phenomenon has the potential to be observed in the tev range .",
    "the power spectrum certainly peaks in the lower energy ranges but the observations at high energies really provide the strongest constraints on the emission models and may ultimately expose the underlying emission mechanism .",
    "the detection of a single photon of energy 18gev from grb970217 , 1.5 hours after the onset of the burst ( @xcite ) , has opened the possibility of delayed emission of gev - tev photons ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although acits have , to date , only presented upper limits ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is possible that in the near future wide field air shower detectors like milagro or the tibet array might detect a prompt vhe emission component and rapid slew acits might do the same with greater sensitivity for any delayed emission .",
    "it is clear that to fully exploit the potential of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy the detection techniques must be improved",
    ". this will happen by extending the energy coverage of the technique ( with good energy resolution ) and by increasing its flux sensitivity ( improved angular resolution and increased background rejection ) .",
    "ideally one would like to do both but in practice there must be trade - offs . reduced energy threshold can be achieved by the use of larger , but cruder , mirrors and this approach is currently being exploited using existing arrays of solar heliostats : stacee ( @xcite ) , celeste ( @xcite ) and solar-2 ( @xcite ) . a german - spanish project ( magic )",
    "( @xcite ) to build a 17-m aperture telescope has also been approved .",
    "these projects will achieve thresholds as low as 20 - 30 gev where they will effectively fill the current gap in the @xmath0-ray spectrum from 20 to 200 gev .",
    "ultimately , this gap will be covered by glast ( @xcite ) .",
    "extension to higher energies ( @xmath710 tev ) can be achieved by atmospheric cherenkov telescopes working at large zenith angles and by particle arrays on very high mountains .",
    "an interesting telescope that has just come on line and will complement these techniques is the milagro water cherenkov detector in new mexico which will operate 24 hours a day with a large field of view and will have good sensitivity to @xmath0-ray bursts and transients ( @xcite ) .",
    "veritas , with seven 10-m telescopes arranged in a hexagonal pattern with 80 m spacing ( figure  [ cam - fig ] ) , will aim for the middle ground between those techniques listed above , with its primary objective being high sensitivity observations in the 100gev to 10tev range ( @xcite ) .",
    "it will be located in southern arizona and will be a logical progression from the whipple telescope .",
    "it is hoped to begin construction in 1999 and to complete the array by 2004 .",
    "the german - french - italian experiment hess , initially four and eventually perhaps sixteen 12 m class telescopes in namibia ( @xcite ) , and the japanese super cangaroo array , with four 10-m telescopes in australia , ( t. kifune , private communication ) will have similar objectives . in each case",
    ", the arrays will exploit the high sensitivity of acits and the high selectivity of the array approach .",
    "the projected sensitivities of magic , hess , supercangaroo and veritas are somewhat similar and we refer to them collectively as next generation gamma - ray telescopes ( nggrts ) .",
    "the relative flux sensitivities for existing and planned @xmath0-ray telescopes as a function of energy are shown in figure  [ main - senscomp - fig ] , where the sensitivities of the wide field detectors are for one year and the atmospheric cherenkov telescopes are for 50 hours . in all cases , a 5@xmath15 point source detection is required .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that , on the low energy side ( @xmath101tev ) , the nggrts will complement the glast mission and will overlap with the solar arrays . at the highest energies to which they are sensitive , nggrts will overlap with the tibet air shower array ( @xcite ) .",
    "they will cover the same energy range as milagro but with greater flux sensitivity .",
    "the wide field coverage of milagro will permit the detection of transient sources which , once detected , can be studied in more detail by the northern nggrts .",
    "these same telescopes will complement the coverage of neutrino sources to be discovered by amanda / ice cube ( @xcite ) at the south pole .",
    "finally , if the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays are localized to a few degrees by hires ( @xcite ) and auger ( @xcite ) , the nggrts will be powerful instruments for their further localization and identification .",
    "the recent successes in vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy ensure that in the inevitable interval between the death of egret and the launch of the next generation @xmath0-ray space telescope , there will be ongoing activity in gev - tev @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "observations by glast and the nggrts in this energy region will make important contributions to our understanding of agns , supernova remnants , and pulsar and @xmath0-ray burst studies . although the number of tev sources detected so far is small , the new and varied phenomena observed indicate that vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy is not merely an extension of mev - gev @xmath0-ray astronomy but is a discipline in its own right . with the advent of new telescopes , the catalog of vhe @xmath0-ray sources will dramatically expand with detailed time histories and accurate energy spectra available .",
