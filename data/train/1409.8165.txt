    "the nature of dark matter  ( dm ) in the universe is one of the big open questions in science .",
    "even though no direct evidence for the particle nature of this non - luminous but gravitationally interacting form of matter has been found yet , dark matter is embraced by the particle physics community as one of the most pressing issues demanding an extension of the well - established standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics . a particle candidate for dark matter",
    "has to be stable or at least long - lived on cosmological time scales .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to understand dynamically the stability of the dark matter .",
    "symmetries provide a nice way to guarantee the stability of a dark matter candidate , but often such a symmetry is only imposed by hand in a particular dark matter model , without following from an underlying principle .",
    "there is a long history of attempts to consistently gauge the accidental global symmetries of baryon and lepton numbers  @xcite of the sm lagrangian .",
    "recently , simple realistic versions of such theories for local baryon and lepton numbers have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "anomaly cancellation requires the introduction of additional fermions , and new fields charged under @xmath0 and @xmath1we refer to them as `` lepto - baryons''provide a simple solution  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter stability is automatic in these theories since after symmetry breaking there is a remnant @xmath2 symmetry in the new sector that forbids the decay of the lightest new particle with fractional baryon number .",
    "these theories have a rich phenomenology and it is worthwhile to study them in more detail .",
    "one of the most interesting predictions is that when local baryon number is broken at the low scale the proton is stable and there is no need to postulate the existence of a large desert .",
    "the cosmological aspects of these models have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that even though baryon number is broken at the low scale , a non - zero baryon asymmetry can be generated in agreement with the experiment .    in this article",

    "we present their decay properties as well as possible production channels at the lhc .",

    "recently , simple theories where the baryon and lepton numbers are local gauge symmetries have been proposed and investigated in some detail  @xcite .",
    "these theories are based on the gauge group @xmath3 there are two simple realistic versions of these theories : one can add new vector - like fields with baryon and lepton numbers to cancel all the anomalies  @xcite , see the particle content beyond the standard model in table  [ tab : modeli ] , or have new fields with majorana masses after symmetry breaking  @xcite .",

    "the lagrangian of the model is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lagrangian for the sm fields .",
    "since all quarks have baryon number , their kinetic term is modified , taking into account an additional coupling to the new gauge boson related to baryon number .",
    "the new part of the lagrangian , @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 field strength tensor and @xmath13 is the @xmath0 field strength tensor .",

    "the term @xmath15 contains the couplings of the new fermions , @xmath16 where the standard model higgs field @xmath17 and the additional scalar boson @xmath18 transform as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the term @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22    the baryon numbers @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the new fermions are constrained by the conditions of anomaly cancellation ( see the detailed discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and one finds that all relevant anomalies are cancelled for any choice of @xmath23 and @xmath24 which satisfy the condition @xmath25 we will therefore treat @xmath26 as a free parameter in the rest of the article . notice that couplings that generate majorana masses for the sm singlet fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 after symmetry breaking such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 would be allowed for @xmath31 .",

    "this is a key result which tells us that the great desert is not needed to suppress proton decay and the cutoff of the theory can be low .    a few comments regarding the @xmath35@xmath36 mixing are in order .",

    "see appendix  [ app : kineticmixing ] for more details , where the loop - induced kinetic mixing is calculated and shown to be within the experimental limits easily .",
    "we will therefore neglect the kinetic mixing @xmath14 in the remainder of the article .",
    "let us also comment on the spectrum of the theory .",
    "after spontaneous breaking of baryon number , we have four charged and four neutral new fermions in the theory .",
    "these fermions carry baryon number , see table  [ tab : modeli ] , and do not couple directly to sm quarks and leptons .",
    "therefore , no new sources of flavor violation in the sm quark and lepton sectors are introduced .",
    "there is a remnant @xmath2 symmetry after breaking of the local @xmath0 under which the new fermions are odd whereas all other fields are even .",
