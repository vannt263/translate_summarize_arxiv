    "<S> based on symmetry constraint that leads to the appearance of nodes in the wave functions of 3-electron systems at regular triangle configurations , it was found that , if the parameters of confinement are skillfully given and if a magnetic field is tuned around the first critical point of  the singlet - triplet transition , a 2-electron quantum dot can be used as  a highly sensitive switch for single - electron transport .    the corresponding author .    </S>",
    "<S> modern experimental techniques , e.g. , using electrostatic gates and etching , allow a certain number of electrons ( from a few to a few thousand ) to be confined in quantum dots.@xmath0  as a kind of systems different from those existing in nature , rich physics is contained .  </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they attract certainly the interest of academic research .  on the other hand , the properties of the dots can be controlled , e.g. , by changing the gate voltage or by applying an external magnetic field , etc . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these systems  have a great potential in application .  in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the dots can be used as a single - electron switch to control the electric microcurrent .  making use of the coulomb blockade @xmath1 , current switches have already been designed by a number of authors ( refer to ref.8 and 9 , and references therein ) .  </S>",
    "<S> this kind of efforts is crucial for developing microtechniques .  in general , there are two factors harmful to the sensitivity of this kind of device , one is thermal fluctuation , another is quantum tunneling .  </S>",
    "<S> the former can be effectively reduced by lowering the temperature , the latter can not .  in order to eliminate the quantum tunneling </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an idea of a new mechanism in this paper .  </S>",
    "<S> related theoretical evaluation has been  performed , however , technical details are not involved .    </S>",
    "<S> let us review briefly the main physics of coulomb blockade .  </S>",
    "<S> let a dot be connected to a source and a drain by tunnel barriers .  </S>",
    "<S> a gate - voltage @xmath2 is applied on the dot , while bias - voltages @xmath3 and @xmath4  are applied on the source and drain , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> let  @xmath5electrons be confined in the dot with the ground state energy @xmath6 .  </S>",
    "<S> if an extra electron comes in from the source , the lowest energy of the ( n+1)-electron system is denoted as @xmath7 .  </S>",
    "<S> the extra electron is driven by the bias - voltage @xmath8 .  </S>",
    "<S> thus the condition of coulomb blockade  is  @xmath9 @xmath10 ( where the constant @xmath11 is introduced by foxman et al.@xmath12 ,  however the actual value of @xmath13  is not essential to the following discussion ) .  </S>",
    "<S> whereas if @xmath14 , the blockade is released and the extra electron would go through the dot to the drain .  by increasing @xmath15 @xmath16  can be reduced as shown schematically in fig.1a .  when @xmath2 increases and arrives at a critical value , the condition @xmath17 holds ,  and resonant transmission occurs .  </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that @xmath16 is changed continuously with @xmath2 .  </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even when @xmath18 , the leak of current might occur due to quantum tunnelling .  </S>",
    "<S> thus , the blockade is not strict , and the sensitivity of the device as a switch is more or less spoiled .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   in the usual device of coulomb blockade  ( a ) , and in an improved device ( b ) .  when @xmath19 , resonant transmission occurs .  </S>",
    "<S> x in ( b ) is a quantity to control the variation of @xmath16 ( not yet specified)@xmath20,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , if one can design a device so that @xmath16 varies abruptly as shown in fig.1b , the quantum tunnelling would be remarkably suppressed and the sensitivity would be greatly improved .  to achieve the abrupt change </S>",
    "<S> ,  we suggest a source - dot - drain device with the following three features .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(1 ) the dot is axial symmetric and contains two electrons .  </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates states have the orbital angular momentum @xmath21 and total spin @xmath22 to be conserved .  </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ground state has @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and energy @xmath25  .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) @xmath2 is fixed at a skillfully prescribed value ( see below ) , while an adjustable external magnetic field @xmath26 is applied and tuned around a critical point @xmath27 so that the ground state undergoes singlet - triplet transitions@xmath28 .  </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , @xmath29 jumps to @xmath30  , or reversely , while the corresponding ground state energies @xmath25  and @xmath31  are identical at the critical point . for convenience , the region @xmath32 is called region i ( ii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) the bias - voltage is low and the extra electrons are controlled so that they are coming slowly one - by - one , the incoming electron is so slow that it is , relative to the center of the dot , in s - wave .    </S>",
    "<S> let us see how this device works .  </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath26  is tuned in region i ,  if the third electron can come in and form a 3-electron system , then the quantum numbers of the 3-body final state are denoted as @xmath33 and the energy as @xmath34 .  </S>",
    "<S> once the partial wave is limited to s - wave , 0nly @xmath35 and @xmath36  are allowed , accordingly @xmath37 @xmath38(if more than one final states are allowed , the higher states are not involved due to the low bias - voltage ) .  </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath39 is in region ii , since the quantum numbers of the 2-electron ground state has already been changed , @xmath33  are accordingly changed to @xmath40 with the energy @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , after the transition , we have @xmath42 .  </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath43  at the critical point , however in general  @xmath44 , therefore @xmath45 .  </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a jump of  @xmath16 occurring at the critical point as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> the realization of the abrupt variation of @xmath16alone is not sufficient .  </S>",
    "<S> in addition , two more conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are required so that quantum tunnelling is nearly zero and @xmath16 jumps down exactly to the right place to initiate the resonant transmission as plotted in fig.1b .  </S>",
    "<S> it was found that , due to the help of symmetry constraint as explained below , these two conditions can be realized if the parameters of confinement are specially designed .  </S>",
    "<S> this is shown by a theoretical study of a model as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   the label @xmath29  is marked by the associated curve@xmath20,title=\"fig : \" ]    for simplicity ,  the model dot is assumed to be 2-dimensional .  </S>",
    "<S> the potential of confinement  is an axial - symmetric square well  @xmath48 if @xmath49 , or  @xmath50 elsewhere ,  where  @xmath51 is positive .  </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a uniform magnetic field @xmath26  is applied perpendicular to the x - y plane ,  the hamiltonian reads    @xmath52 @xmath53    where @xmath54 ,  @xmath5 is the number of electrons ( equal to 2 or 3 ) , the zeeman term is included .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55=0.067@xmath56 , the dielectric constant @xmath57=12.4 ( for a gaas dot ) , and the units @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60  are used through out this paper .  </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is diagonalized to obtain the eigenenergies by using the methods as outlined in 18 , 19 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]  , the critical point of singlet - triplet transition , as a function of  @xmath51  when @xmath61  is fixed ( for a gaas dot)@xmath20,title=\"fig : \" ]    the ground state energies @xmath25 calculated with  @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( just as an example ) are plotted in fig.2 as a function of @xmath26 .  </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative feature of fig.2 would remain unchanged if  @xmath51 and @xmath61 vary inside a large reasonable region . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the increase of @xmath26 causes a number of singlet - triplet transitions and totally three critical points appear .  </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the vicinity of the first critical point , denoted as @xmath27 ( equal to @xmath64 in fig.2 ) is suitable for our purpose .  </S>",
    "<S> we shall concentrate in the vicinity of @xmath27 .  in region </S>",
    "<S> i  ( @xmath65 ) and ii , ( @xmath66 = @xmath67 and ( 1,1 ) , respectively .  </S>",
    "<S> it was found that , when @xmath61 is given , the value of @xmath27 depends on @xmath51 nearly linearly .  </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , when @xmath68  when @xmath69  .  the larger the @xmath51 , the larger the @xmath70 , while the larger the @xmath61 , the smaller the @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath26 is given in region i , if the third electron with s - wave can come in , ( @xmath71 ) should be ( 0,1/2 ) .  selected values of @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> are calculated and plotted as functions of @xmath26 as shown in fig.3 .  on the other hand , from dynamical consideration , </S>",
    "<S> if the three electrons form a regular triangle ( rt ) , the total potential energy can be minimized . </S>",
    "<S> thus the rt is a favorable configuration .  </S>",
    "<S> however , from the study of symmetry constraint @xmath73 ,  it was known that  the spatial wave function of a 3-electron state @xmath74 would be zero at the rts if @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,  or if @xmath77  and @xmath78 ,  where @xmath79  = 0 , 1 , 2 , @xmath80 .  </S>",
    "<S> this is called a prohibition of regular triangle ( prt ) , and will definitely cause serious effect .    </S>",
    "<S> let us prove the prt when @xmath78 .  in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 is totally antisymmetric .  </S>",
    "<S> when the three electrons form an rt , a rotation of the system by @xmath82 is equivalent to a cyclic permutation of particles .  </S>",
    "<S> the rotation leads to an extra factor @xmath83  , while the permutation is equivalent to two interchanges and thus causes nothing . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the equivalence leads to    @xmath84    this equation holds only at the rt configurations .  evidently , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath85 , the first factor of ( 2 ) is nonzero , therefore @xmath86 must be zero at the rt .  </S>",
    "<S> it implies the appearance of an inherent node at the rt , and the prt  holds .  </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath76 can be similarly proved@xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   and @xmath88  with respect to @xmath26 in the vicinity of  @xmath27 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is fixed at @xmath89  , and @xmath51 is given at a number of values ( in mev)@xmath20,title=\"fig : \" ]    when prt holds , the inherent node at the rt will remarkably increase the kinetic energy , and at the same time push the wave function away from the area of lower potential energy .  </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the associated energy @xmath90  is considerably higher than those free from the prt .  for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath91  is in general high .  by adjusting @xmath51 or @xmath61 ,  @xmath91 </S>",
    "<S> can be easily much higher than @xmath92resulting in a large @xmath93 as confirmed by fig.3 .    in region </S>",
    "<S> ii , the s - wave limitation leads to two choices ( @xmath94 ) = ( 1,1/2 ) and ( 1,3/2 ) .  </S>",
    "<S> due to the prt ,  @xmath95  is considerably higher and therefore can be neglected .  </S>",
    "<S> whereas , due to being free from the prt ,  @xmath96 is remarkably lower ,  this leads to a small @xmath97 @xmath98as plotted in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the prt assures  @xmath46 , this leads to the great jump shown in fig.3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second condition @xmath47 can also be satisfied by adjusting the parameters of confinement .  in what follows @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> is assumed due to the very low bias - voltage .  when @xmath63 , we know fom fig.3 that @xmath100  holds if @xmath101 .  in general , for a given @xmath61 , there is a corresponding @xmath102 so that the pair  of parameters @xmath103 and @xmath61 gives  @xmath104 at @xmath105 .  </S>",
    "<S> based on our numerical results ( @xmath106 ) , a nearly linear relation @xmath107 was found .  </S>",
    "<S> the larger the @xmath61 , the smaller the  @xmath103 .  when other types of confinement ( e.g. , a parabolic potential with a limited height ) are used , special set of parameters can also be found to assure  @xmath100 at @xmath105  ( not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can conclude that , if the parameters of confinement are skillfully chosen , due to the symmetry constraint and making use of the singlet - triplet transition , when @xmath26 is tuned in the vicinity of its first critical point ( @xmath27 ) , the two - electron dot can work as a highly sensitive switch at very low temperature .  </S>",
    "<S> the regions i and ii are associated with  off  and  on  , respectively .    for a further discussion , a typical low - lying spectrum of the 2- and 3-electron dots in the vicinity of @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> is given in fig.4 ( where @xmath51 is a little larger than @xmath103 ) .  </S>",
    "<S> for these systems the levels not appearing in the figure are much higher .  if @xmath51 is given considerably larger than @xmath103 ,  @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> would become considerably lower and lead to  @xmath108 .  in this case the intruding electron  may find some way to release its energy ( e.g. , by emitting a photon or a phonon ) and falls into the level @xmath96 .  </S>",
    "<S> if this occurs , the intruding electron can not go out again but remain inside , thereby the previous mechanism of transport would be spoiled .  </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath51 is better given at @xmath109 this leads to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case a resonant transmission takes place and the intruding electron has no chance to remain inside .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   versus  @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath110the parameters @xmath103 and the associated  @xmath61 together assure the condition of resonant transmission , i.e. , @xmath111 , ( here @xmath112 is assumed ) @xmath113,title=\"fig : \" ]    if the confinement potential contains non - symmetric component @xmath114 , @xmath21 is no more strictly conserved .   in region </S>",
    "<S> i ( in the status  off  ) </S>",
    "<S> if the 2-body ground state contains a small @xmath115 component , this component can absorb the incoming s - wave electron and goes to the @xmath96 level , thereby a leak may occur . alternatively , </S>",
    "<S> if the 2-body ground state contains a small @xmath116 component , this component can not absorb the extra s - wave electron because the level @xmath117 is quite high ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 ) .  </S>",
    "<S> this fact implies that only the kind of @xmath114 with odd parity would cause a leak , this kind should be diminished as far as possible ( e.g. , in the technical aspect , the two pipes connected to the dot are placed by the two sides as symmetric as possible ) .  </S>",
    "<S> a representative  @xmath118 with odd parity can be written as  @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the original one in eq.(1 ) .by using the perturbation theory , for two representative cases , the ratio of the weights of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 components in the 2-body ground state is @xmath123 if @xmath63 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ;  and @xmath126 if @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and@xmath129  .  from this evaluation ,  </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath130 and @xmath131 are in the order of 10@xmath132 ,  @xmath118 would not cause a serious problem .  besides , a smaller @xmath61 would lead to a larger level - spacing @xmath133 , and therefore a smaller @xmath134 .  the kondo effect would do no harm in this device .  </S>",
    "<S> this effect ceases to exist in the status  off  because the spin of the dot is meanwhile zero , while this effect is promotive in  on  .  </S>",
    "<S> however , the thermal fluctuation might spoil the sensitivity of the device .  in the status </S>",
    "<S>  off  , if the 2-electron state has been raised up from the ground state to the level @xmath135 by thermal fluctuation , the third electron may come in and the system may fall to the level @xmath96 , and thus the  off  is no more strict .  </S>",
    "<S> let us define@xmath136 @xmath137 which is the ratio of the probabilities of staying in the levels @xmath135 and @xmath138 , respectively , and is plotted in fig.5 as a function of @xmath26 , where @xmath139  is given at a number of values .  from this figure , we know that , if @xmath140 0.01k , when @xmath141 the thermal fluctuation is negligible .  therefore , in this temperature ,  a change of @xmath26 in the order of 0.01 around @xmath27  is sufficient to initiate the  on  or  off  of the switch .  </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath142 is much smaller than 0.01k , a very small change of @xmath26 is sufficient to initiate the  on  or  off  , thus the switch becomes highly sensitive .    </S>",
    "<S> the s - wave limitation is a basic requirement .  to evaluate in a semi - classical way , </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that a classical electron comes in with a velocity @xmath143 along a straight pipe with a radius @xmath144 aiming at the center of the dot .  </S>",
    "<S> then the angular momentum is @xmath145 and the s - wave limitation is @xmath146  , or @xmath147 , where @xmath144 is in @xmath59 , and @xmath148 is the velocity of light in vacuum .  on the other hand , the thermal velocity @xmath149 , where @xmath142 is the temperature in @xmath150 .  </S>",
    "<S> thus , the requirement can be rewritten as @xmath151  .  if @xmath152 even @xmath143 is as large as @xmath153  , the requirement , namely @xmath154  can be realized with the present technics of fabrication . as final remarks , </S>",
    "<S> two distinguished features of the suggested device as a sensitive switch are noticeable .  </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the quantum tunneling has been greatly suppressed .  </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the device is highly sensitive to the variation of @xmath26 at low temperature ,  this is the superiority .  </S>",
    "<S> however , since very low temperature together with the s - wave limitation and good axial symmetry of the dot are required , the effectiveness of the switch depends on the technical aspect , and remains to be checked .  </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it is believed that the idea proposed in this paper , i.e. , making use of the effect of symmetry constraint and phase transition , is in general useful in the design of various microdevice . </S>"
