    "expanding herbig - haro ( hh ) flows arising from protostellar objects are among the most spectacular observed phenomena during the star formation process @xcite",
    ". hh flows , which can extend over parsec scale distances @xcite , are signposts of interaction of the protostellar activity with the ambient cloud medium . at scales of a fraction of parsec from the powering protostar",
    ", they appear collimated showing a jet - like morphology @xcite . however ,",
    "at parsec scales the collimation is less evident because first , the possible precession can enhance an s - shaped morphology for the flow and , second , the common presence of multiple outflow sources in star forming clouds may cause contamination by neighboring flows @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the measurement of the actual length of hh flows can be sometimes controversial , since it is not easy to associate distant and tentative hh objects to a specific hh flow without further evidence ( e.g. through proper motions or physical properties of the object ) .",
    "a peculiar case , the hh 80/81/80n jet , is found in the region ggd 27 @xcite , located in sagittarius at a distance of 1.7  kpc @xcite .",
    "the jet is powered by a young , high - luminosity protostellar object , iras 18162@xmath12048 with a total luminosity of @xmath2  @xmath3 , derived from the iras survey . recently ,",
    "@xcite detect compact millimeter emission towards this source , which is interpreted by these authors as arising from a massive ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) , and compact ( @xmath6  @xmath7  300  au ) disk .",
    "vla observations carried out towards iras 18162@xmath12048 by @xcite reveal that this source is elongated , pointing to the south toward hh 80 and 81 , the brightest herbig - haro objects known .",
    "hh 80n is located 3  pc north of iras  18162@xmath12048 and is the northern counterpart of hh 80 and 81 .",
    "hh 80n has only been detected at radio wavelengths due to the possible high extinction of this region @xcite .",
    "these authors have also found several radio knots aligned with the central source and the hh objects , which indicates that these condensations probably trace a highly collimated jet .",
    "evidence of wiggling of the flow axis suggests that the driving source is precessing , and preserving the collimation up to scales of @xmath8  5  pc , being one of the largest collimated jet systems known so far @xcite .",
    "the high outflow velocities of 500  km  s@xmath9 , derived from proper motions measurements @xcite , suggest that the emission arising from the radio jet is due to very strong shocks @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation , indicating the presence of relativistic electrons , has been recently found in this jet @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report the results of recent cm continuum observations carried out with the jansky very large array ( jvla)/very large array ( vla ) toward the northern lobe of the hh 80/81/80n jet aimed at looking for knots further away than hh 80n . up to date , hh 80n",
    "is assumed to be the head of the hh 80/81/80n jet .",
    "determining the true size and age of the jet is crucial , as it can be an important supplier of energy and momentum to the cloud .",
    "therefore , the hh 80/81/80n jet is a good target to investigate the effects of pc scale jets on star formation in molecular clouds .",
    "jvla / vla continuum observations of the northern part of the hh 80/81/80n radio - jet were carried out on june 2009 in the c configuration ( 6 and 20  cm bands ) and october 2009 in the d configuration ( 6  cm band ) .",
    "the phase center was always set at the position of the hh 80n object , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , except for the d configuration observations , for which we performed a two point mosaic with one field centered on the hh 80n position and the other offset ( 81 , 328 ) . a bandwidth of 100  mhz ( for the two polarizations ) was employed .",
    "the flux calibrator was always 3c286 and the phase calibrators were j1820@xmath1254 at 6  cm and j1833@xmath1210 at 20  cm .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated using the aips package of nrao .",
    "the maps were highly contaminated by the emission of a strong radio source , j1819@xmath12036 , located at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this source was first reported by @xcite from a radio continuum survey at 11  cm obtained with the effelsberg  100 m antenna ( their source num . 359 ) .",
    "the flux density measured in our 6 and 20  cm maps is @xmath14 and @xmath15  mjy , respectively . in order to avoid the strong sidelobes generated by this source ,",
    "its clean components were subtracted from the visibility dataset of each block .",
    "the resulting final maps of the ggd  27 region are shown in figure  [ vla_cm ] .",
    "figure  [ vla_cm ] shows that iras  18162@xmath12048 is elongated , pointing to hh 80n .",
    "a few marginal knots appear in the map connecting both objects following the shape of a jet .",
    "this is best seen in the 6  cm map obtained with the d configuration .",
    "the 6  cm map in the c configuration proves that the jet is very well collimated . at 20",
    "cm , contamination at short baselines , probably due to galactic background emission , prevented the proper imaging of the extended emission .",
    "table  [ vla_fluxes ] gives the measured position , flux at 6 and 20  cm , and the spectral index of the sources belonging to the hh 80/81/80n radio - jet .",
    "our flux values are systematically slightly lower than those reported in table  2 of @xcite , possibly due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "the spectral indices are consistent with those derived by @xcite except for hh 80n , for which we found a spectral index slightly more negative .",
    "all spectral indices are well below the minimum value required for having free - free emission ( -0.1 , @xcite ) , which suggests that the contribution of synchrotron emission is significant @xcite .",
    "source 33 has very negative spectral index ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this source is not aligned with the jet path and is likely extragalactic .",
    "source 34 , detected at the 6 and 20  cm bands with no associated counterparts at any other wavelength , appears to be located about 6  north of hh 80n ( @xmath17  from iras 18162 - 2048 ) , roughly in the direction of the hh 80/81/80n radio jet .",
    "this source , not reported before , has a negative spectral index of @xmath18 , similar to the values found for hh 80 , hh 81 and hh 80n , and characteristic of the jet . the d configuration map at 6  cm ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows that this source is elongated in the north - south direction aligned roughly with the direction of the jet .",
    "what is the a priori probability that source 34 is a background source unrelated to the star forming region ?",
    "we will assume that we would have considered the source associated with the outflow if it appeared anywhere inside a rectangular box with dimensions of @xmath19 with its major dimension along the outflow axis .",
    "the solid angle of this rectangle is 5 square arcmin .",
    "following @xcite the a priori probability of finding a 1  mjy background source at 6 cm inside such a solid angle is only @xmath80.03 .",
    "we then consider unlikely that source 34 is not associated with the star forming region .",
    "@xcite found that the different radio knots of the hh 80/81/80n radio jet are not completely aligned but rather follow locations compatible with a precessing jet . in order to test",
    "if source 34 is part of the hh 80/81/80n jet , we extrapolated the expected path of the jet modeled by @xcite assuming that the jet is precessing with the jet axis in the plane of sky . using the coordinates @xmath20 , with @xmath21 perpendicular to the jet axis and @xmath22 along the jet axis , the @xmath21 position of a knot",
    "is given by the sinusoidal expression .",
    "@xmath23    where @xmath24 is the half - opening angle of the jet , @xmath25 is the initial precession phase angle for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the wavelength of the wiggles in the plane of sky .",
    "table  [ jiggling_results ] gives the results of the fit of the expression ( 1 ) to the knots of the hh 80/81/80n jet , without including source 34 ( i.e. aimed at reproducing the results of @xcite , model a ) and including this source ( model b ) . in this analysis",
    "we also employed @xcite data obtained from observations in the c configuration at 6  cm , which have a field of view covering the jet from hh 80n to hh 80/81 , in order to include source 13 , hh 81 and hh 80 .",
    "the resulting sinusoidal path for both models are shown in figure  [ jiggling ] .",
    "this figure shows the map resulting from the observations reported in @xcite combined with the new data reported in this letter obtained in the c configuration at 6  cm .",
    "the parameters of model a have values similar to those obtained in @xcite as expected ( note that the precession angle in @xcite is the full opening angle , i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , the sinusoidal path resulting from this fit misses source 34 by about 20  ( see blue line of fig .  [ jiggling ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "model b yields a jet path close to source 34 ( see red line of fig .  [ jiggling ] ) .",
    "the parameters of both models have similar values except for @xmath25 and @xmath27 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ jiggling ] , in the model b , the jet has longer wiggles in the plane of the sky with respect to model a.",
    "given the symmetry of the hh 80/81/80n radio knots , it is plausible that source  34 has a counterpart in the southern lobe .",
    "we inspected the 20  cm map but did not detect any emission above 1.6 mjy at the expected counterpart position .",
    "note that this is not a stringent upper limit due to the contamination at low baselines caused probably by galactic extended emission .",
    "we also checked surveys observed at wavelengths suited to detect hh shock emission ( e.g. h@xmath29 supercosmos ) but found no emission around the expected counterpart position . also , this position falls outside the field of view of the 6 cm band observations .",
    "nevertheless , observations of hh complexes show that they are not necessarily strictly symmetric ( hh  111 : @xcite ; hh  34 : @xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetry of the hh 80/81/80n jet could be caused by the fact that the southern lobe of the jet moves beyond the edge of the cloud , changing the flow appearance further away than hh 80 because it enters in a low pressure medium . the projected distance from hh 80n to the southern bow shock beyond hh 80 at a distance of 1.7",
    "kpc is 7.5  pc @xcite .",
    "if source 34 belongs to the hh 80/81/80n jet then its total extent to the plane of sky is 10.3  pc . correcting from inclination effects using @xmath30 for the value of the angle of the jet axis to the plane of the sky @xcite",
    ", we derive 18.4  pc of total extent of the hh system .",
    "this updated size is 5.0  pc larger than the size previously stablished by @xcite .",
    "the extraordinary collimation of the hh 80/81/80n jet extending from the new reported source 34 to hh 80 and 81 is in agreement with the idea that the ejection mechanism of the jet operates similarly as in the low luminosity protostars .",
    "however , the results presented here show that the collimation and symmetry of pc scale jets tend to break at some point because the chances of finding a heterogeneous medium are higher as the jet propagates far away in the cloud .",
    "iras 18162@xmath12048 also reveals similarities with low luminosity protostars .",
    "continuum mm observations towards this source suggest that the emission arises from a massive and compact disk surrounding the driving source of the hh 80/81/80n jet @xcite .",
    "the derived mass ratio between the disk and the central star is @xmath31 0.3 @xcite , which seems to be consistent with the typical values found for low mass protostars .",
    "these authors also obtained a crude estimate for the mass accretion rate of the disk onto the central powering protostar of @xmath32  @xmath5  yr@xmath9 . adopting a mass for the central object of @xmath33  @xmath5  @xcite ,",
    "the accretion phase must have started between @xmath34  yr ago .",
    "assuming that hh 80n is the northern end of the hh 80/81/80n jet and all its condensations move ballistically with a constant spatial velocity of 625  km  s@xmath9  ( obtained using the average tangential velocity of hh 80 and hh 81 and the angle of the jet axis to the plane of sky of @xcite ) , we derive a dynamical age of @xmath35  yr for the jet .",
    "however , if source 34 belongs to the hh 80/81/80n jet , the dynamical age increases to @xmath36  yr .",
    "furthermore , the hh 80/81/80n jet may be decelerating as a consequence of the loss of kinetic energy as the jet passes through the cloud , as indicated by the high mechanical luminosity of hh 80n ( a few @xmath37  @xmath3 , @xcite ) . for this case",
    ", the dynamical age must be @xmath0  yr , consistent with the upper limit for the age of the accretion phase of iras 18162@xmath12048 derived above .",
    "ahead of hh 80n there is a dense core extensively studied by our team with signatures of star formation and supersonic infall velocities @xcite . given the close location of the core to the most powerful jet known and its peculiar kinematics ,",
    "it has been suggested that the star formation of this core has been triggered or at least sped up by the hh 80/81/80n jet @xcite .",
    "the estimated age of the protostar embedded in the hh 80n core ( @xmath38  yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) falls in the range comprised between the lower limit of the estimated dynamical age of the jet and the upper limit of the age of the main accretion phase of its energy source , @xmath39  yr . moreover , our observations of high density tracers in the hh 80n region ( masqu et al . 2012 , in prep . )",
    "suggest that there is a dynamical interaction between hh 80/81/80n jet and the hh 80n core : the velocity gradients of the high density gas are consistent with the possibility that part of the core is being swept by the hh 80/81/80n jet in the process of dissipating energy .",
    "this could turn some regions in the core gravitationally unstable .",
    "this possibility appears also evident in the high angular resolution continuum maps of the hh 80n core @xcite , which show that the hh 80n core is fragmenting into several condensations , one of them clearly associated with the embedded object in the core .",
    "therefore , the hh 80/81/80n jet may play a role in the star formation process of the hh 80n core .",
    "conclusive evidence for this possibility would provide an illustrative case of sequential star formation in a cloud occurring at scales of parsecs ."
