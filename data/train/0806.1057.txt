    "it is often stated that the lhc is a machine for discovery of new physics and we will need a new lepton collider to find out what the actual underlying theory is .",
    "this is because most of new physics signals at the lhc involve multiple jets in final states which are not simple objects to deal with .",
    "it is also true that studies of events with missing momentum at hadron colliders are more challenging compared to those at lepton colliders because we can not use the momentum conservation in the beam direction .",
    "moreover , unfixed energies of the initial partons are another obstacle in studying the exclusive processes . for this reason ,",
    "most studies are limited to forming lorentz ( or boost ) invariant quantities out of visible objects to look for peaks , endpoints or excesses above expected backgrounds .",
    "such kinds of observables do not usually give enough information to determine the lagrangian parameters .",
    "although lepton colliders generally offer a better environment for the studies of exclusive processes , at hadron colliders it is not impossible to carry out a detailed study of new - physics events if the final states are clean enough .",
    "in fact , one of the best - motivated models of new physics , supersymmetry ( susy ) , may provide such an opportunity . in the case where the scalar tau lepton ( @xmath4 ) is lighter than the neutralinos and",
    "sufficiently long - lived , final states of susy events have two charged tracks of @xmath4 rather than a missing momentum associated with escaping neutralinos .",
    "the presence of such a long - lived charged particle significantly improves the capability of the lhc to study susy models .    although the light @xmath4 scenario has been treated as an alternative and exotic possibility , it is actually neither theoretically exotic nor cosmologically problematic .",
    "since the right - handed @xmath4 carries only the u(1)@xmath5 quantum number , quantum corrections to its mass through gauge interactions are small whereas colored and su(2 ) charged sfermions obtain large positive contributions .",
    "in addition , the yukawa interaction tends to give a negative contribution to the mass .",
    "therefore , it is pretty reasonable to assume that the @xmath4 is the lightest among the superpartners of the standard model fields . in such a case",
    ", the lifetime of @xmath4 can be very long although the estimate depends on the detail of the model ; it can decay into a gravitino and a tau lepton through a suppressed interaction if it is kinematically allowed or into two standard model fermions if @xmath6-parity is violated .",
    "there are cosmological constraints on such a long - lived charged particle  @xcite ( @xcite for related works ) , but those can be evaded as long as we do not assume an extremely long lifetime .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent realistic scenario of supersymmetry which predicts a long - lived @xmath4 and naturally explains dark matter of the universe by gravitinos . )",
    "there have been studies of the long - lived @xmath4 at the lhc , and dramatic differences from the stable neutralino scenario have been reported . in ref .",

    "we assume the lifetime of @xmath4 is sufficiently long ( @xmath10  ns ) so that most of the produced @xmath4 s reach the muon system where their three - momentum can be measured .",
    "combined with mass measurements  @xcite , one can reconstruct the four - momentum of the @xmath4 s .",
    "we mainly focus on the chargino - neutralino production process since it has the largest cross section among the electroweak production processes and the final state is rather simple but rich enough to be reconstructed on an event - by - event basis .",
    "a particularly interesting process is @xmath11 , where it is required that the neutralino decays into @xmath4 with the opposite charge to the one from the chargino to avoid a combinatorial background .",
    "the leptonically decaying @xmath12 s are selected so that we can easily measure the charge of @xmath12 .",
    "the leptonic mode is also cleaner than @xmath12-jets with which we need to worry about uncertainties such as fake jets and the energy scale .",
    "the final state ( two opposite - sign @xmath4 s , a lepton and a missing momentum ) is clean enough to be compared directly with the theoretical calculation .",
    "we present a formula of the cross section taking into account the spin correlations and demonstrate that various distributions can be seen at the lhc experiments .",
