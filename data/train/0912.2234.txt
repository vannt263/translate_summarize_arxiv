    "lasers are widely used in many fields of applied and fundamental research . however , for some applications , a serious drawback is their residual frequency instability .",
    "free - running lasers without any measures of active or passive frequency stabilization exhibit frequency fluctuations ( laser linewidths ) much larger than the schawlow - townes limit  @xcite and are subject to continuous frequency drifts .",
    "for example , free- running diode lasers show a laser linewidth of about 100  mhz and frequency drifts of up to many 10  mhz / h , due to temperature and air pressure fluctuations in the laboratory , diode current instabilities etc .  @xcite .",
    "whereas the linewidth of a diode laser can be narrowed to typically less than 1  mhz using the passive optical feedback from a grating  @xcite , the unwanted frequency drifts on longer time scales are more difficult to eliminate . a common technique is to actively stabilize the laser onto an external high - finesse fabry - perot interferometer ( fpi ) or , alternatively , onto suitable atomic or molecular transitions . for the latter ,",
    "transition lines of various substances , e.g. , alkaline atoms or molecules like iodine or tellurium , have been widely in use .",
    "the thorough investigation of the iodine spectrum by gerstenkorn et al .",
    "@xcite together with the ease with which an iodine vapor cell can be handled make iodine a particularly attractive element for this purpose @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there are also a number of drawbacks : the main spectrum of iodine ranges from 500 to 900  nm , and within this range the number of strong lines is limited so that for many frequencies of interest no excitation lines for the laser frequency stabilization are available . in this case",
    "it is principally always possible to use an external fpi to stabilize the laser .",
    "however , to set up an external fpi may entail considerable experimental efforts and , moreover , can not completely eliminate the unwanted residual frequency drifts .",
    "therefore , if possible , it is usually advantageous to use atomic or molecular transitions as a reference for the active laser frequency stabilization since the atomic excitation frequencies do not change in time .",
    "apart from iodine , there is thus a high demand to search for other atoms or molecules suitable for this purpose .    in this paper , we investigate a hitherto unexplored element in use for active laser frequency stabilization , namely the atom praseodymium . because of its five outer valence electrons , the energy spectrum of praseodymium exhibits an extremely rich level structure starting already @xmath3 above the ground state . since the spectrum resembles more that of a solid than that of an atom , it is sometimes also called ` quasi - continuous ' .",
    "the praseodymium spectrum has been well investigated by several groups over the last few decades @xcite .",
    "so far , more than 1200 energy levels and transition lines are known in the spectral range from 320  nm to 3.5  @xmath4 m of which one third has been classified so far .",
    "this multitude of excitation lines , including a rich hyperfine structure ( hfs ) for each resonance , in combination with the comprehensive knowledge of the spectrum make praseodymium an attractive element for the frequency stabilization of laser sources .    in what follows ,",
    "we report the first active frequency stabilization of a laser onto a praseodymium resonance .",
    "several praseodymium transitions between 1105  nm and 1123  nm were systematically investigated for this purpose , corresponding to the tuning range of the diode laser used in the experiment .",
    "the transitions were excited in a hollow cathode lamp ( hcl ) and recorded via laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) .",
    "active frequency stabilization of the diode laser was demonstrated using standard laser locking techniques . in this way ,",
    "the frequency drift of the diode laser of more than 30  mhz / h was eliminated and its frequency continuously stabilized to within 1.4(1 )  mhz .",
    "in addition , one new strong praseodymium transition close to the 4@xmath5  sub - harmonic of the d@xmath1  transition  of mg@xmath2  at was found , making it possible to actively lock the diode laser at this wavelength .",
    "after frequency quadruplication this will allow the continuous excitation of the mg@xmath2  d@xmath1  transition at .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sects .",
    "[ pr ] and [ setuplif ] we present the element praseodymium and introduce the experimental setup used to obtain the praseodymium lif spectra . in sects .",

    "[ conclusion ] we finally draw conclusions .",
    "the chemical element praseodymium ( pr ) belongs to the lanthanide series ( rare earths group ) and is placed between the elements cerium ( ce ) and neodymium ( nd ) .",
    "one of the prominent pr electron configurations with three valence electrons inside the @xmath6 shell is [ xe]@xmath7 .",
    "the lowest term under a total of 17 terms of this configuration is a @xmath8 , where @xmath9  corresponts to the electronic ground state of pr .",
    "hereby , the designation @xmath9  describes the coupling of the three equivalent electrons in the open @xmath6 shell in ls - notation ( ls - coupling nomenclature : @xmath10 denotes the parity of the level and @xmath11 in this case ) .",
    "the naturally occurring pr is composed of only one stable isotope pr with nuclear spin @xmath12 .",
    "the hyperfine interaction causes a hyperfine level splitting determined by the magnetic dipole coupling constant @xmath13 and the electric quadrupole coupling constant  @xmath14 ( magnetic dipole moment @xmath15 = 4.2754(5 )  @xmath16 @xcite , electric quadrupole moment @xmath17 = -0.0024  b @xcite ) . for a hyperfine sublevel characterized by the quantum number @xmath18 the shift @xmath19 with respect to the corresponding fine structure level energy",
    "can be written in first order perturbation theory in the form    @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath18 are the nuclear spin , the total electron and total atom angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "eq.([hfs ] ) is usually called _",
    "casimir s formula_. since the pr nucleus is almost spherical , the electric quadrupole term can be largely neglected in eq.([hfs ] ) .",
    "the hyperfine splitting leads to a manifold of hfs sublevels .",
    "the number of sublevels is given by : @xmath24 if at least one of the @xmath23-values of the combining fine structure levels is greater than 5/2 , then the hyperfine structure shows a flag pattern with six main ( diagonal ) hyperfine components . besides these main components two additional groups of weaker off - diagonal hyperfine components can be observed where the number of off - diagonal elements depends on @xmath25 . if @xmath26 one can find 10 off - diagonal components",
    "whereas if @xmath27 there are only 9 off - diagonal components can be observed . since the frequency spacing between neighboring hyperfine components is typically on the order of 2  ghz and with doppler - widths of approximately 400  mhz at 1115  nm the full spectrum of the hfs can be usually resolved . to obtain the spectra the spectroscopic method of lif",
    "is employed using a specially designed hcl .",
    "the active laser frequency stabilization onto a particular pr transition can be roughly divided into two parts .",
    "the first part deals with the generation of a strong lif signal in the hcl with high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the second part refers to the laser frequency stabilization itself , i.e. , the stabilization of the laser onto a particular lif resonance .",
    "both parts will be discussed in more detail in the following three sections .     increases the population of the upper level @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the fluorescence intensity of the light stemming from the spontaneous decay of this level is modified .",
    "this modification is recorded and used for the active laser frequency stabilization . the fluorescence light is usually composed of a set of different fluorescence channels with wavelengths @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ,  , which give information on the excited state .",
    "each energy level is characterized by four parameters , namely @xmath32 , @xmath23 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "this set of parameters represents an atomic fingerprint of an energy level and can be calculated from the observed lif spectrum .",
    "this information in connection with the set of measured lif wavelengths allows to classify the transition.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "lif spectroscopy in combination with an hcl is a sensitive and technique of recording the spectra of various gaseous substances .",
    "the broad - band excitation in the hollow cathode discharge leads to a highly - excited plasma with a local thermodynamic equilibrium of the population distribution among the atomic energy levels .",
    "therefore , lif in an hcl makes it also possible to investigate the level schemes of high - lying energy states , in the case of pr of up to above the ground state .        the basic principle of lif spectroscopy is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : prinzip_lif ] .",
    "the laser beam with wavelength @xmath33 is led through the plasma column of the hollow cathode discharge and is slowly scanned over the spectral range of interest .",
    "the selective absorption of the laser beam increases the population of the upper level @xmath28 when hitting a resonance .",
    "this change in the population distribution can be detected by measuring the rise of fluorescence light intensity at the wavelengths @xmath34 , emitted by the spontaneous decay from the upper level @xmath28 to corresponding lower levels ( lif ) .",
    "a lif signal will only be recorded if the laser frequency is in resonance with a dipole allowed transition between certain hyperfine sublevels @xmath18 of the lower level @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the upper level @xmath28 . a tunable monochromator ( spectral bandwidth @xmath37  =  0.2  nm ) which registers the fluorescence light makes it possible to separate all decay channels of the fluorescence spectrum . at the same time , the wavelength band - pass filter of the monochromator avoids an overload of the photomultiplier tube caused by the bright light emitted by the hollow cathode plasma over the whole spectral region .",
    "there are two conceptionally different kinds of lif experiments , depending on the operation of the monochromator .",
    "for the first type of experiments , the laser frequency is tuned to an optical resonance , so that the monochromator can be used to analyze the lif emission spectrum . since every energy level decays spontaneously into particular final states depending on the selection rules , the monitored fluorescence light can give information on the position , parity and quantum number @xmath23 of the upper state .",
    "in the other type of experiment , the monochromator is tuned to a strong lif line and the laser frequency is then scanned over a frequency region of interest to obtain the hyperfine structure of the excitation line . in this way , the entire hfs of a spectral line can be studied .",
    "both lif methods are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : prinzip_lif_2arten ] .",
    "the last mentioned method has been applied mostly in this work .    the experimental setup for the generation of the lif spectra is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_lif ] . a commercial diode laser from toptica photonics ( dl 100 ) at 1115",
    "nm center wavelength is used for the excitation of pr atoms produced by sputtering inside the hcl .",
    "the grating - stabilized extended cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) has a linewidth of less than 1  mhz which is sufficiently narrow to record the doppler - broadened pr resonances .",
    "the ecdl has a maximum output power of 83  mw at 208  ma and is tunable over a range of almost 20  nm , from 1105 to 1123 nm ; without mode hopping the laser can be tuned in single mode over 20  ghz .",
    "the internal collimator lens of the ecdl is used to focus the laser beam into the hcl to yield optimum illumination of the reaction volume . in order to prevent unwanted optical feedback from the hcl and other optical elements an optical isolator with isolation @xmath38  60  db",
    "is installed in front of the ecdl .",
    "a beam splitter placed behind the optical isolator feeds parts of the laser light into a wavemeter and an fpi .",
    "both devices are used to determine the laser frequency .",
    "the wavemeter ( uncertainty  50  mhz ) is used for the absolute frequency calibration of the lif spectra whereas the fpi ( free spectral range 2.109(12 )  ghz ) serves as an additional frequency marker in order to linearize the recorded lif spectra .",
    "the non - commercial hcl especially designed for this experiment consists of several parts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hcl ] ) .",
    "the central element of the symmetrical hcl is a copper tube into which an axially hollowed cathode of 20 mm length is screwed , filled on the inner walls with pr .",
    "in addition , axially hollowed anodes made from aluminum are fixed at both ends of the copper tube .",
    "the inner diameter of the hollow cathode , best for the investigation of neutral pr , has been found to be 3  mm .",
    "the copper tube together with the cathode and the two anodes is placed inside a glass cylinder , sealed at both ends with brewster windows to allow maximum transmission of the laser beam through the hcl .",
    "the hcl was operated with a buffer gas ( argon ) at a pressure of 0.5  mbar . in order to obtain a constant discharge current of about 60  ma , a voltage of 300",
    "v was applied . under these conditions",
    "one can assume that the fraction of atomic pr in the plasma amounts to more than 90  percent , the rest of the sputtered material being mainly singly ionized pr@xmath2 .    in order to achieve a more stable discharge ,",
    "the hcl can be cooled with liquid nitrogen . the nitrogen cooling results in an internal temperature of the hcl of about 100 to 200  @xmath39c ( boltzmann temperature ) which greatly reduces the doppler - widths of the spectra down to typically 350 to 400  mhz at 1115  nm .",
    "passing laser radiation through the gas discharge yields a new population distribution among the two energy levels of pr participating in a resonance .",
    "the fluorescence light that leaves the hcl in case of resonant laser excitation is collected by a pin - hole mirror ( placed on the side of the incoming laser beam ) and is directed to the entrance slit of the monochromator by a set of mirrors and lenses .",
    "the monochromator with a tuning range from 300  to  900  nm and a resolution of @xmath40 can be used to filter single lif lines out of the total fluorescence spectrum .",
    "a photomultiplier with high sensitivity for the visible spectrum is mounted at the exit slit of the monochromator allowing the detection of extremely low fluorescence signal changes .",
    "in addition , a mechanical chopper ( 280  hz ) placed inside the laser beam enables a phase - sensitive detection and amplification of the lif signals by use of a lock - in amplifier ( lia ) .",
    "even very low - intensity lif signals in an extremely noisy environment can thus be observed and recorded .    the lif signal together with the marker signal from the fpi",
    "are simultaneously recorded and stored in a computer .",
    "the acquired lif spectra can then be processed by an especially designed evaluation program @xcite .",
    "this program serves to determine the hfs parameters of the measured lines by fitting the experimentally recorded spectra by a theoretical curve composed of a specified number of voigt profiles using the method of least- squares .",
    "fitting parameters of the theoretical curve are the hyperfine constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the involved lower and upper energy levels , the linewidths of the gaussian and lorentzian parts of the voigt profiles , and the relative intensities of all hyperfine components .",
    "the total angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath23 and @xmath41 of the lower and upper levels can be chosen separately before the algorithm of the fit is carried out .",
    "the choice of specific @xmath23 values defines the number of hyperfine components and is therefore a prerequisite for a good theoretical reconstruction of the recorded hfs patterns . as the positions of a maximum of 16 ( if @xmath42 ) or 15 ( if @xmath27 ) hfs components obey the casimir relations ( see eq.([hfs ] ) ) , only one additional parameter ( the center of gravity position of the line ) is needed . the final fit and the experimental spectrum are plotted together .",

    "the ultimate frequency stability of the laser is determined by the s / n ratio of the lif signal .",
    "since the lif signal is relatively low and furthermore obscured by the bright fluorescence background of the hcl , it is necessary to work with a lock - in amplifier ( lia ) ( see sect .  [ setuplif ] ) .",
    "the lif signal , after amplification by the lia , is fed into the lir to produce the error signal for the active frequency lock ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_lif_lock ] ) . since the laser frequency is also modulated for the lock - in detection unit of the lir , a too large time constant of the lia actually improves the s / n of the lif signal but at the same time also averages over the lir modulation and thus suppresses the lir error signal . a good compromise between a reasonable s / n of the lif signal and an acceptable error signal of the lir is therefore mandatory . for this purpose the modulation frequency of the lir was reduced to the smallest selectable value ( 8.2  hz ) .",
    "the bandwidth of the locking loop , given approximately by half of the modulation frequency of the lir , therefore corresponded to about 4  hz .",
    "this allows mainly the compensation of the low - frequency instabilities of the laser , i.e. , the laser drift .",
    "in the previous section we presented the active frequency stabilization of a diode laser onto a particular hyperfine transition of pr at . the selected pr line served however merely as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of locking a laser onto a pr resonance using lif spectroscopy . in principle , the diode laser could have been stabilized onto any other suitable pr line in the range from 1105 to 1123  nm .    by frequency quadrupling the stabilized infrared diode laser , in the range 276 to 281  nm can be produced .",

    "<S> we present a new possibility for the active frequency stabilization of a laser using transitions in neutral praseodymium . because of its five outer electrons , this element shows a high density of energy levels leading to an extremely line - rich excitation spectrum with more than known spectral lines ranging from the uv to the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the active frequency stabilization of a diode laser on several praseodymium lines between 1105 and 1123  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation signals were recorded in a hollow cathode lamp and observed via laser - induced fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> these signals are strong enough to lock the diode laser onto most of the lines by using standard laser locking techniques . in this way , the frequency drifts of the unlocked laser of more than 30  mhz / h were eliminated and the laser frequency stabilized to within 1.4(1 )  mhz for averaging times @xmath0  s. frequency quadrupling the stabilized diode laser can produce in the range from 276  to  281  nm . in particular , using a strong hyperfine component of the praseodymium excitation line  at  makes it possible - after frequency quadruplication - to produce laser radiation at , which can be used to excite the d@xmath1  line in mg@xmath2 . </S>"
