    "<S> we present a model addressing the orientation transition of symmetric block copolymers such as ps / pmma on smooth and rough surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion free energy of parallel and perpendicular lamellar phases in contact with a rough solid surface is calculated as function of the surface roughness amplitude and wavelength , as well as the polymer lamellar periodicity ( molecular weight ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find an analytical expression for the orientation transition . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is compared and agrees well with recent experiments done with six different polymer molecular weights and surface preparations .    as self - assembling systems </S>",
    "<S> become better understood , more emphasis is being given to finding ways to control the assembled structure , i.e. to orient ordered phases in a certain direction or anneal defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> block copolymers ( bcp ) are excellent model systems , which provide a good balance between price and chemical versatility , and are being extensively studied for technological applications as well as from a basic scientific viewpoint @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous ways to affect the bcp phase - behavior and orientation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , using shear flow @xcite , confinement between two solid surfaces @xcite , or application of an external electric field @xcite .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we consider a lamellar phase of symmetric diblock copolymers ( each block has a mole fraction of @xmath0 ) on top of a rough surface . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude and periodicity of surface modulations determine if the lamellae will be parallel or perpendicular to the substrate @xcite , as has been recently shown experimentally by sivaniah et al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this new and alternative method to orient bcps can be advantageous to the methods mentioned above because of its simple experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this note is to extend results of a previous theoretical modelling @xcite showing its direct applicability to the experimental findings @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface roughness is modelled by a single one - dimensional corrugation mode , whose height in the @xmath1-direction above an @xmath2 reference plane is given by @xmath3 . as is shown on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the wavenumber and amplitude of the surface roughness , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the bcp is put above the substrate in the half - space @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath7 is the wavenumber of the bulk lamellae of width @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the interfacial interaction ( per unit area ) between the a and b blocks in the polymer chain , and @xmath10 is the surface tension difference between the substrate and the two types of polymer blocks .        </S>",
    "<S> we start by examining the order - parameter of lamellae oriented perpendicular to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the presentation follows the same lines as of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath11 this is the deviation of the a - monomer relative concentration from its average value @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of sinusoidal variation , @xmath12 , depends on the degree of segregation and vanishes at the order - disorder temperature ( odt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath13 is a slowly - varying function that describes surface - induced perturbations of the lamellae from their perfect shape . </S>",
    "<S> we write the bulk part of the free energy , in complete analogy with the elastic energy of smectic liquid crystals @xcite : @xmath14 { \\rm d}^3r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the bending modulus and @xmath18 is the compression modulus .    </S>",
    "<S> several assumptions are made regarding the length scales and energies involved , as are explained in more detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath19 and @xmath20 we will be mainly interested in the poly(styrene)/ poly(methylmethacrylate ) system , where the a - block is chosen as the ps and the b - block as pmma . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding parameters are @xmath21 mn / m for the surfaces considered below , and @xmath22 mn / m , so eq  [ valid2 ] roughly holds . </S>",
    "<S> the inequalities in eq  [ valid1 ] are not satisfied in all the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath23 is indeed larger than @xmath24 , @xmath23 is between 1 and 4 and is not smaller than unity as assumed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath25 does not strictly hold . nevertheless , using the above inequalities we were able to make simple analytical predictions by minimizing the energy with respect to the distortion field @xmath26 . up to numerical prefactors , the bulk free energy of the perpendicular state is @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the surface area .    </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the same calculation as above but now for parallel lamellae . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter is given by @xmath29 and the bulk free - energy is @xmath30 { \\rm d}^3r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we minimize the distortion field @xmath26 in the same limits as in eqs  [ valid1 ] and [ valid2 ] , and find @xcite @xmath31 equations  [ fperp_old ] and [ fpara_old ] , use the surface energy to obtain the distortion field @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we now add this substrate - bcp interfacial tension and compare the gain and loss in the total free energy of the two states , including the bulk distortion and interfacial tension terms . </S>",
    "<S> this was not done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the case of perpendicular lamellae , </S>",
    "<S> the substrate is approximately equally covered by the a and b monomers ( the symmetric case of ps / pmma ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , adding the interfacial - tension term to eq  [ fperp_old ] results in the following free - energy @xmath32 the extra factor @xmath33 is the ratio between the real surface profile @xmath3 and the flat one , @xmath34 , for small surface corrugations .    for parallel lamellae </S>",
    "<S> , we have a surface in contact with a layer rich in b monomers ( pmma ) . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting surface proximity effects , we consider that this layer has a concentration of b - monomer with amplitude @xmath35 and a - monomers ( ps ) with amplitude @xmath36 , recalling that @xmath12 is the deviation of the order parameter from @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy is @xmath38 , and the total parallel free - energy becomes @xmath39 \\left(1+\\frac14(q_sr)^2\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to find the orientation transition , we equate @xmath40 to @xmath41 [ eqs  [ fperp ] and [ fpara ] ] while estimating @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition value of @xmath43 is given by : @xmath44 note that this equation includes the information of the melt segregation via @xmath12 ( @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , as the temperature approaches the odt , @xmath12 tends to zero the energetic difference between the parallel and perpendicular states goes to zero as well .    in order to compare these predictions of the lamellar orientation dependence on the various roughness parameters , we used some of the results reported in ref .  @xcite . in that paper sample orientation </S>",
    "<S> was determined by a combination of cross - sectional tem microscopy , atomic force microscopy and dynamic secondary - ion mass spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the principle result was to demonstrate that an increase in the substrate roughness amplitude , @xmath5 , led to a transition from parallel to perpendicular orientation , while other substrate parameters were untouched .    </S>",
    "<S> six observations of orientation were also made with three molecular weights of symmetric ps - pmma block copolymer ( of different @xmath46 ) on four substrates of different @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we can use these observations to test the validity of our current theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> the bcp samples are denoted 18k-18k , 38k-36.8k and 50k-54k , according to the molecular weight of ps and pmma blocks in the chain , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the four substrates are : super - critically rough indium tin oxide ( sc - ito ) , under - critically rough ito ( uc - ito ) , smooth ito ( s - ito ) and super - critically rough polyimide ( sc - pim ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the experimental parameters are summarized in table i. the prefixes of @xmath47 and @xmath48 were used to denote the degree of roughness of the substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the sc - pim substrate was made by imprinting a polyimide surface with a sc - ito surface . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , sc - pim and sc - ito had identical topological features . </S>",
    "<S> contact angle measurements at @xmath49c on all of the substrates revealed that there was no large difference in the wetting properties of ps and pmma on all of these substrates . for more details </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> an assumption of identical substrate surface energy allows all six observations to be collated onto a single orientational phase diagram . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we plot the experimental points and the transition lines predicted by eq  [ gov_eq ] on three types of plots . in part </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) , @xmath7 is used to scale the two other parameters : @xmath4 and @xmath5 and to produce two dimensionless parameters for the plot : @xmath50 and @xmath24 . in the range of experimental parameters , the transition line between parallel and perpendicular states , eq  [ gov_eq ] , is very close to a straight line ( up to about @xmath51 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for a fixed @xmath46 , @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> our above findings should be compared with a previous model by turner and joanny @xcite that predicted an orientation transition at @xmath53 and independent of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the limited number of experimental systems , it is hard to rule out any theoretical fit . </S>",
    "<S> however , it looks that the latter prediction does not fit well the experiments summarized in fig .  2 . in our model </S>",
    "<S> the limit of @xmath54 is obtained by formally setting @xmath55 in eq  [ gov_eq ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that the validity of our model , as well as the experiments , is in the opposite limit of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 ( a ) shows that all samples found to be in the parallel morphologies in the experiments lie indeed above the theoretical transition line and all perpendicular morphologies lie below it , with the exception of the sc - ito 50k-54k sample , which lies a little inside the parallel region , although it is measured as a perpendicular state . </S>",
    "<S> the same information is presented differently in parts ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . in ( b ) we think of @xmath4 as the rescaling factor and plot @xmath57 as function of @xmath24 . from eq  [ gov_eq ] and under the condition @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath59 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( b ) we see again that beside the sc - ito 50k-54k sample , all other data points fit with the theoretical prediction . and finally in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  2 ( c ) , @xmath46 and @xmath4 are rescaled by @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams in parts ( b ) and ( c ) may seem counter - intuitive at first sight . at a given surface roughness @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the parallel phase to the perpendicular one occurs as @xmath8 decreases ( or @xmath46 increases ) . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising behavior can be understood by looking at the dependence of the distortion field @xmath13 on the distance @xmath1 from the surface . for perpendicular lamellae , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> hence distortions relax at a distance from the substrate comparable to the lamellar spacing . </S>",
    "<S> undulations in the parallel phase , however , are given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> as the bcp molecular weight decreases , @xmath8 decreases , @xmath64 increases , and @xmath65 decreases , resulting in a longer extent of the distortion @xmath26 field in the @xmath1 direction . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the accumulated frustration of parallel lamellae leads to their relative instability towards the perpendicular phase . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the smaller the molecular weight is , the more stable the perpendicular lamellae tend to be .    </S>",
    "<S> more experiments should be carried out so that the phase - diagram can be fully mapped . in particular the above - mentioned effect should be further explored , giving special attention to the possible creation of island and holes or other defects which are not included in this simple theoretical framework . </S>"
