    "in 1987 , bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) @xcite proposed the concept of self - organized criticality ( soc ) in order to understand the automatic ( i.e. without a tuning parameter , such as temperature ) appearance of abundant self - similar structures and scaling quantities in nature .",
    "btw also proposed a lattice sandpile model and used monte carlo simulations to simulate this model on square and simple cubic lattices .",
    "they did observe self - similar structures and scaling quantities in the simulation data without tuning any parameter .",
    "since 1987 , many natural phenomena have been related to soc , such as earthquakes @xcite , forest fires @xcite , biological evolution @xcite , rice pile dynamics @xcite , turbulence @xcite , etc .",
    "many lattice models have also been proposed to illustrate the behavior of soc or avalanche processes @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the btw s sandpile model is abelian @xcite and some quantities for this model could be calculated exactly @xcite . the btw s abelian sandpile model ( asm )",
    "@xcite has been considered to be a prototypical model for soc .",
    "many ideas about behavior of soc models , such as universality and scaling @xcite , or new methods for studying soc models , such as renormalization group theory @xcite , are often first tested in the btw s asm . in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a computer algorithm which is useful for carrying out renormalization group transformations for the btw s asm .",
    "the btw s asm on a lattice @xmath3 of @xmath4 sites is defined as follows .",
    "each site of @xmath3 is assigned a height integer ; the @xmath5-th site is assigned @xmath6 for @xmath7 . in the beginning of the simulation , the height integer at each site",
    "is randomly chosen to be 0 , 1 ,  , or @xmath8 , where the critical height is @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "for each time interval @xmath10 , one particle falls on a randomly chosen lattice site , say the @xmath5-th site ; the height @xmath6 then becomes @xmath11 .",
    "if the new @xmath12 , then randomly choose a site again , say the @xmath13-th site , to add a particle ; if @xmath14 , then the @xmath5-th site topples and its height @xmath6 becomes @xmath15 .",
    "at the same time , each of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites of the @xmath5-th site receives one particle , i.e. , @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the label of the @xmath19th nn site of the @xmath5-th site .",
    "this relaxation procedure takes time @xmath20 and we assume @xmath21 .",
    "if some of the new @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath19 , are equal or larger than @xmath9 again , these sites are denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "then , the toppling process continues in parallel for each @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath13-th nn site of the @xmath25-th nn site of the @xmath5-th site .",
    "the relaxation time for these parallel toppling and receiving processes between @xmath24 and @xmath28 takes another time @xmath20 .",
    "usually , the open boundary conditions are used so that when a boundary site topples , the particle can leave the system .",
    "the dynamical process continues until the heights of all sites are less than @xmath9 . in general ,",
    "if the last toppling site is @xmath29 , the total toppling process takes time @xmath30 . in this way , a series of toppling processes with toppling area @xmath31 ( i.e. , the total number of toppled sites ) and relaxation time @xmath32 appears and forms an avalanche which has no characteristic size .    after repeating many times the process of adding one particle on a randomly chosen site with subsequent relaxation when the height of the site is equal or larger then @xmath9",
    ", we can obtain a distribution of toppling area @xmath33 and calculate the average relaxation time @xmath34 for avalanches with toppling area @xmath31 .",
    "it has been found that @xmath35 with the avalanche exponent @xmath1 and @xmath36 with the dynamical exponent @xmath2 .",
    "manna @xcite used monte carlo simulations to calculate @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the btw model on the square ( sq ) lattice .",
    "majumdar and dhar conjectured that @xmath39 which is consistent with their own numerical simulations @xcite , and priezzhev et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath40 . by scaling argument , tebaldi et al .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath41 .",
    "many investigations have been just focused on numerical simulations or exact results for height probabilities and exponents for the sq lattice and there is little attention to other kinds of lattices .",
    "it is not clear whether the sandpile model on two dimensional lattices have the same set of critical exponents .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) theory has been used successfully to calculate critical exponents , order parameters , etc , of ordinary phase transition models , e.g. the ising model @xcite , the potts model @xcite and the percolation model @xcite ; it has also been used to understand universality and scaling in ordinary phase transition models .",
    "it is of interest to know whether one can also use rg theory to calculate critical exponents for lattice soc models , e.g. the btw sandpile model . in 1994 ,",
    "pietronero , vespignani , and zapperi ( pvz ) @xcite first proposed a rg theory to calculate critical exponents of the btw sandpile model on the sq lattice .",
    "they used a stationary condition to provide a feedback mechanism that drives the system to its critical state .",
    "in fact , in their approach , the height of a site @xmath6 is reduced to only three cases corresponding to three classes : stable for @xmath42 , critical for @xmath43 , and unstable for @xmath14 .",
    "the obtained renormalization group equations allow them to get an attractive fixed point . at this fixed point",
    ", they obtained avalanche exponent @xmath1 = 1.253 and dynamical exponent @xmath2 = 1.168 . in 1995 , pvz @xcite described in more details their rg approach to the btw sandpile model . in 1996 ,",
    "ivashkevich @xcite generalized pvz s rg scheme with real height parameters @xmath6 by kinetic equations and used the technique of generating function to construct rg equations to obtain the exponent @xmath1 = 1.248 and height probabilities .",
    "in addition , ivashkevich found that for the sq lattice critical particle transfer probabilities are close to branching probabilities for spanning tree .",
    "however , papoyan and povolotsky @xcite pointed out that such connections could be wrong and used the example of the plane triangular ( pt ) lattice to illustrate their ideas . in 1996 ,",
    "vespignani , zapperi , and loreto @xcite proposed a real space dynamical driven renormalization group to provide a theoretical basis for previous rg studies of the asm . in 1997 ,",
    "lubek and usadel used extensive monte carlo simulations to find that @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "one important step in the rg approach to a lattice sandpile model is the exact enumeration of all possible toppling processes of sandpile dynamics inside a cell for rg transformation .",
    "pvz and ivashkevich divided the height configurations inside a rg cell into subsets with the same number of critical height by hand .",
    "after this procedure , for each height configuration , pvz counted the possible toppling events by hand and ivashkevich did this by the technique of generating function .",
    "based on refs .",
    "@xcite , in the present paper we formulate a computer algorithm for rg studies of the btw sandpile model on the sq , pt , and honeycomb ( hc ) lattices .",
    "the advantage of our method is that we do nt need to classify all height configurations inside a rg cell into different subsets by hand which is different for different kinds of lattices and rg cell sizes .",
    "therefore , it is easier for us to extend the same algorithm to different cell sizes and different kinds of lattices .",
    "another advantage of our method is that we can study larger rg cells .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite , they have only carried out @xmath45 cell to one site and 5-site cell to one site rg transformations for the sq lattice , and we can carry out @xmath0 cell to one site rg transformation ( rgt ) for the sq lattice .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider both pvz and ivashkevich rgts .",
    "using the pvz reduced height rg equations , we calculate the density of critical sites @xmath46 , the probability for one site to transfer sands to @xmath5 different nearest neighbors @xmath47 , the avalanche exponent @xmath1 and the dynamical exponent @xmath2 by @xmath45 and @xmath0 cells to one site rgts for the sq lattice , and 3 sites cell to one site rgt for the pt lattice . using the ivashkevich s real height rg equations",
    ", we calculate the critical height probabilities , the critical sand transfer probabilities , the avalanche exponent @xmath1 , and the dynamical exponent @xmath2 by @xmath45 cell to one site rgt for the sq lattice and 3 sites cell to one site rgt for the pt lattice .",
    "we find that our calculated height probabilities are consistent with the exact and numerical simulations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the reduced height rg equations . here , we extend pvz s formulation for the sq lattice to a general lattice . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a systematic computer algorithm for the exact enumeration of all possible toppling processes of sandpile dynamics inside a cell for rgt . by using this algorithm , we present the obtained fixed points of reduced height rg equations and the critical exponents in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we apply real height rg equations to the btw model on sq and pt lattices . for a different definition of rg cell for the hc lattice , in sec .",
    "vi we calculate the critical sand transfer probabilities and find that they are different from branching probabilities of spanning trees on the same ( hc ) lattice .",
    "this result confirms papoyan and povolotsky s result @xcite for the pt lattice .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss problems for further studies in sec . vii .",
    "in this section we extend pvz s formulation of rg transformation @xcite for the sq lattice to a general lattice @xmath3 and present a simplified version which is useful for realization by a computer program .",
    "then , we propose an algorithm for counting events of rg procedure . in the next section",
    ", we will show that this calculation is basically consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite for a @xmath45 cell of the square lattice . however , there are some mistakes in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as in ordinary real space rg transformations for the spin and percolation models",
    "@xcite , in the rg transformation for the btw sandpile model on the lattice @xmath3 with lattice constant @xmath48 , we first divide @xmath49 into @xmath50 cells , then consider the transformation from each @xmath50 cell into a cell with a smaller number of sites or a supersite . in the present paper , we consider only the later case . from the relationship between the cell and the supersite , the properties of the specified cell can be approximately represented by the supersite .",
    "after the first step of rg transformation , we have a lattice , call @xmath51 , of supersites with lattice constant @xmath52 .",
    "we can carry out the second step rg transformation on @xmath53 to obtain a new lattice @xmath54 with lattice constant @xmath55 and we can continue such rg transformation to obtain a series of lattices @xmath56 with lattice constant @xmath57 .",
    "examples of rg cells for sq and pt lattices are shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively , whose linear dimensions ( i.e. @xmath58 values ) are 2 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "here we briefly review pvz s rg approach to the btw s asm @xcite .",
    "if we consider a sandpile rg cell with @xmath60 sites , the initial height @xmath6 of each site @xmath5 inside a rg cell can take integer values @xmath61 or @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the coordination number of lattice @xmath3 ; for example figs 1(a ) and 1(b ) correspond to the sq and the pt lattices , with @xmath64 4 and 6 , respectively . after adding one particle to one lattice site ,",
    "say site @xmath5 , if the site @xmath5 is unstable ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , the site @xmath5 will topple and transfer particles to @xmath65 different nearest neighbors . in general , @xmath65 can take values @xmath66 or @xmath63 after rg transformation which is different from @xmath67 for the original sandpile evolution on @xmath68 . as an illustration ,",
    "the pictures of @xmath65 for the sq lattice are shown in fig .",
    "the toppling rule @xmath65 can be described by the transferring probability @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the probability that the unstable site @xmath5 transfers particles to @xmath65 different nearest neighbors ; if @xmath65 is smaller than @xmath63 , one should also specify which directions the particles go into , which will be explained in more details in the next section . in general , the evolution of the asm at the initial stage @xmath68 , is characterized by the initial height configuration set @xmath71 = @xmath72 = @xmath73 @xmath74 or @xmath75 and the toppling rule @xmath76 = ( @xmath63 , @xmath63 , ... , @xmath63 ) . that is @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 at this stage .",
    "for example , for the asm model on the original square lattice , the height and transferring probability can take value @xmath81 , 1 , 2 or 3 and @xmath82 ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ) , respectively . on the other hand , after the rg transformation , the height configuration set and toppling rule configuration set are @xmath71 and @xmath83 , respectively , where @xmath83 = @xmath84 = @xmath85 @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "in this way , the transferring probability @xmath88 and the initial height probability @xmath89=@xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the probability that the height of the supersite is @xmath5 , are useful to characterize the properties of the coarse grained sandpile dynamics .",
    "we use @xmath92 = @xmath93 and @xmath94 = @xmath95 to denote the transferring probability and initial height probability on lattice @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 are linked by the @xmath13-th rg transformation . instead of @xmath98 = 0 for @xmath99 and @xmath100=1 and @xmath101 in the original level , the normalized condition @xmath102 and @xmath103 are used in the coarse grained level .    in order to simplify the rg transformation ,",
    "pvz reduced the height of a site @xmath6 to only three cases corresponding to three classes : @xmath104 which is stable for @xmath42 , @xmath105 which is critical for @xmath43 , and @xmath106 which is unstable for @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 will be replaced by @xmath107 = @xmath108 = @xmath109 @xmath110 or 1 , @xmath111 , the evolution rule is as follows : if a critical site @xmath5 with height @xmath105 receives one particle , its height is now @xmath112 and site @xmath5 becomes unstable .",
    "then , this unstable site will transfer particles to neighboring sites with the transferring probability @xmath80 . after this action ,",
    "this toppled site becomes stable with @xmath104 . in this approach ,",
    "the stable site is still stable even if this site receives more than one particle .",
    "it means that the multi - toppling process of one site is omitted in pvz s rg approaches .",
    "since pvz used height configuration @xmath107 and toppling rules configuration @xmath83 to describe the rg sandpile evolution , the height probability vector @xmath89 can be simplified to one parameter @xmath46 , which is the probability of critical sites , and @xmath96 becomes @xmath113 .",
    "an avalanche event specifies how a toppling process goes on .",
    "figure 3 shows a typical avalanche event of a sandpile evolution on a three - site cell of the pt lattice .",
    "the labels of sites and toppling directions are shown in fig .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows a starting height configuration with site 1 being critical , site 2 being critical and site 3 being stable , i.e. , @xmath114=(1 , 1 , 0 ) .",
    "this starting height configuration appears with a probability @xmath115 .",
    "when we add one particle to site 1 , site 1 becomes unstable and transfers one particle to site 2 via directions 2 and out of cell via direction 6 .",
    "note that the probability of adding one particle to site 1 is 1/3 since there are 3 sites inside the rg cell and the probability of transferring particles to directions 2 and 6 from site 1 is @xmath116 since there are @xmath117 possible toppling rules for transferring two particles to six directions .",
    "after site 2 receives one particle from site 1 it becomes unstable and transfers one particle to site 1 via direction 5 , one particle to site 3 via direction 6 , and two particles out of cell via directions 1 and 2 ; the probability of transferring particles to four nn sites from site 2 via directions 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 is @xmath118 . since site 1 will not topple again and site 3 is a stable site , the toppling process stops . in summary , the probability of the avalanche event and the relaxation time ( @xmath119 ) of fig .",
    "3(b ) are @xmath120 and 2 ( we set @xmath121 ) , respectively .",
    "under rg transformation , each three - site cell of @xmath122 transfers into one supersite of @xmath56 as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "3(c ) ; a site of @xmath122 can transfer particles to six directions shown in the right - hand side of fig .",
    "3(a ) and a supersite of @xmath56 can transfer particles to six directions shown in the right - hand side of fig .",
    "3(c ) , which correspond to six outgoing directions of fig .",
    "1(d ) . in the avalanche event of fig .",
    "3(b ) , the particles which leave the cell in directions 6 , 1 , and 2 contribute to outgoing particles in directions 5 , 1 , and 2 , respectively , in the figure at the right - hand side of fig .",
    "3(c ) ( see also fig .",
    "thus the avalanche event of fig .",
    "3(b ) in @xmath122 contributes to @xmath123 for the supersite of @xmath56 .    in general , the probability of one avalanche event is determined by the initial height configuration , the starting site of the avalanche , and the detail of the toppling process .",
    "if the initial height configuration is the @xmath19-th element of @xmath107 and contains @xmath124 critical sites , the starting site is site @xmath125 , the toppling process consists of @xmath126 unstable sites which transfer @xmath13 particles to @xmath13 different directions for @xmath127 , the probability of this avalanche event is @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 ... , and @xmath132 are zero or positive integer and @xmath133 which is the total number of toppled sites .",
    "since we do nt consider multiple toppling events ( i.e. , one site can topple at most once ) , @xmath134 should be equal to or smaller than @xmath135 .    to construct rgt",
    ", we should first collect all possible events on a rg cell of @xmath122 .",
    "consider the set of events @xmath136 which are initiated by the @xmath19-th initial height configuration of @xmath107 and starting site @xmath125 , have relaxation time @xmath119 , topple @xmath126 times by toppling rule with @xmath13 directions .",
    "for the set @xmath137 we count the number of events on @xmath122 which topple @xmath5 directions in point of view of site on @xmath56 .",
    "this number is denoted by @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath139 @xmath140 is the summation of probability of toppling events on @xmath122 which evolve under the @xmath19-th initial configuration on @xmath122 and contribute to the @xmath141 on @xmath56 .",
    "note that it is possible to have toppling processes inside a cell but transfer nothing outside a cell .",
    "pvz omits all of these events and ivashkevich et .",
    "al . @xcite simply assumed these events appear with probability @xmath142 .",
    "now the properties of the system are fully characterized by the distribution @xmath143 at this scale .",
    "then , the rg equation can be written as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the total number of configurations in @xmath107 which could contribute to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rg1 ] ) , @xmath146 , the weight of the @xmath19-th element of @xmath107 , is a function of @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the normalized constants of @xmath150 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "this rg equation can be well understood by the transition rate and master equation of sandpile evolution @xcite .",
    "another important assumption is the inflow of particles equals the flow of particles out of the system , i.e. , in the stationary state , @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath147 is a function of @xmath155 for @xmath19 from 1 to @xmath63 and can be written as @xmath156 replacing @xmath147 in @xmath146 and @xmath148 of eq .",
    "( [ rg1 ] ) by eq .",
    "( [ rg2 ] ) , @xmath157 is a pure function of @xmath155 for @xmath19 from 1 to @xmath63 . from rg assumption , at @xmath158 , the critical transferring probability @xmath159 = @xmath160 and the critical density @xmath161 can be obtained .",
    "in lattices @xmath56 for @xmath162 obtained after rg transformations , one site can transfer particles to one , two , ... , or @xmath63 different directions with probabilities @xmath163 , @xmath164 , ... , and @xmath165 , respectively .",

    "a site can transfer one particle or nothing to a specified direction @xmath169 which is denoted by the variable @xmath170 with values @xmath171 or 0 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the toppling rules of sites are exactly determined by the vector @xmath172 . since one unstable site sends nothing to its neighbors",
    "is omitted in pvz rg transformation , @xmath173 = @xmath174 is forbidden . for a given @xmath175 ,",
    "the site will send @xmath176 particles to @xmath19 different directions .",

    "there are two possible reasons .",
    "the first reason is that we do nt consider the multiple toppling events in the rg calculations .",
    "the errors arising from the multiple toppling events are larger for @xmath0 cell . therefore , when the cell size increases , we should consider the multiple toppling events in order to get accurate values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this can not be done easily in exact enumeration approach to rg transformations , but can be done by monte carlo rg calculations .",
    "another possible reason is that the critical exponent @xmath1 is not well defined for the btw sandpile model and therefore rgt can not be used to obtain the critical exponent .    for the pvz approach ,",
    "the critical density of sites , @xmath161 , is equivalent to height probabilities , @xmath306 , in the ivashkevich approach . if we compare the value of @xmath161 with the numerical or exact @xmath306 , we find that @xmath161 is larger than @xmath306 .",
    "this is related to the rule that in pvz approach the stable site will not topple even the stable site receive more than one particles .",
    "therefore , the obtained @xmath161 must be larger to compensate the loss of stable sites which have the potential of toppling . again",
    ", when the cell size is larger , the compensation effect is also larger .",
    "for example , @xmath161 obtained from @xmath0 cell of the square lattice is larger than that obtained from the @xmath45 .",
    "there is no such kind of problem in ivashkevich s approach .",
    "we find the @xmath301 is consistent with the numerical simulations and exact results .    in summary",
    ", it is worthwhile to consider the multiple toppling events in the real height rg treatment in order to answer the question discussed above .",
