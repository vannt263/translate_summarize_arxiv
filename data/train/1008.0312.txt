    "a three - dimensional cone - manifold is a metric space obtained from a collection of disjoint simplices in the space of constant sectional curvature @xmath2 by isometric identification of their faces in such a combinatorial fashion that the resulting topological space is a manifold ( also called the underlying space for a given cone - manifold ) .",
    "such the metric space inherits the metric of sectional curvature @xmath2 on the union of its 2- and 3-dimensional cells . in case",
    "@xmath3 the corresponding cone - manifold is called spherical ( or admits a spherical structure ) . by analogy , one defines euclidean ( @xmath4 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath5 ) cone - manifolds .",
    "the metric structure around each 1-cell is determined by a cone angle that is the sum of dihedral angles of corresponding simplices sharing the 1-cell under identification .",

    "it follows from the paper @xcite that the spherical dodecahedron space ( i.e. poincar homology sphere ) is a cyclic @xmath21-fold covering of @xmath9 branched over @xmath16 .",
