    "weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) , i.e. , the coherent distortion of images of faint distant galaxies by the gravitational tidal field of the intervening matter distribution @xcite , has been established as a powerful cosmological tool [ see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ] . since",
    "this effect is purely gravitational , it directly probes the matter distribution along the line of sight , thus providing a way to understand the nature and the evolutionary history of the universe that is relatively insensitive to how light or baryons trace dark matter . since the earliest measurements of wl by galaxy clusters @xcite ,",
    "wl by large - scale structure , known as `` cosmic shear '' , has been detected based on optical @xcite and radio observations @xcite .",
    "future wl surveys , such as the _ large synoptic survey telescope _ ( lsst ) , will measure the cosmic shear field with great precision over half the sky .",
    "recent attention has focused on how best to extract information from the shear / convergence field in order to constrain cosmological parameters . the primary focus",
    "so far has been using the standard two - point statistics @xcite , which probes the underlying matter power spectrum in projection . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use a simple , direct observable : the fraction of high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) points detected in wl surveys , as another discriminator of cosmology .",
    "we utilize the results of an n - body simulation to quantify both the theoretical predictions and the observational uncertainties of this statistic .",
    "as is well - known , the common two - point statistics do not contain all the statistical information of the wl convergence field , as the nonlinear gravitational instability induces non - gaussian signatures in the mass distribution and hence in the wl convergence field as well .",
    "unfortunately , there is no complete statistical analysis in practice for the underlying matter density field in the nonlinear regime .",
    "previous studies of weak lensing statistics on small angular scales , correspondingly , were restricted to the low - order statistics , using the halo model [ see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ] , or the `` scaling ansatz '' @xcite , later extended and calibrated by n - body simulations @xcite , for the nonlinear evolution of clustering .",
    "these low - order statistics include : the two - point correlation function or equivalently the power spectrum , at small scales @xcite , the three - point correlation function or the bispectrum @xcite , the third - order moment : skewness @xcite and the fourth - order moment : kurtosis @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the redshift distribution of nonlinear object abundance @xcite , such as shear - selected galaxy cluster samples @xcite , using the press - schechter prescription @xcite with calibration by n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the `` ratio - statistic '' @xcite has been constructed to use the geometrical information from tomographic shear / convergence power spectra on small scales .",
    "these analyses have shown that comparable information may be contained in the linear and in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the statistics mentioned above are by no means a full characterization of the convergence field , yet they all face challenges , either from the theoretical or the observational side , which need to be addressed . including higher - order statistics",
    "might give a substantial increase in information , but they are in practice noisy and computationally intensive . to take advantage of the synergy between these statistics , one needs to account for their covariance , which is difficult to calculate analytically .",
    "one hope is to run large simulations and directly measure this covariance .",
    "galaxy cluster samples selected optically , by their x - ray flux or by their sunyaev - zeldovich effect signatures , are limited by the uncertain astrophysics when modeling the mass - observable relations and require `` self - calibration '' @xcite , as the mass function is exponentially sensitive to errors of limiting mass . shear - selected galaxy clusters , on the other hand , have the advantage that the selection function can be determined ab initio by n - body simulations , since only gravity is involved .",
    "however , projection effects result in false detections , missing clusters @xcite , and producing significant uncertainty in the cluster mass derived from the shear signals @xcite , degrading the cosmological information content .    in this paper , we instead focus on the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the wl convergence field .",
    "there are three main motivations .",
    "first , the one - point pdf is a simple yet powerful tool to probe non - gaussian features , and since the non - gaussianity in the convergence field is induced by the growth of structure , it holds cosmological information @xcite .",
    "these previous works have shown that the one - point pdf is capable of discriminating cosmologies with different @xmath1 , such as an open cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , a flat cosmological constant - dominated ( @xmath2)-cdm model , and a standard cdm model .",
    "second , and the primary motivation of this work , is that the fractional area statistic we propose in this paper takes into account projection effects by construction .",
    "determined by the high - convergence tail of the pdf , it is an analog of press - schechter formalism , thus similar to the abundance of galaxy clusters but without contamination due to projection effects .",
    "this statistic also utilizes information mainly from the nonlinear regime and complements the well - established statistics in the linear regime .",
    "the goal of our work is to give a more quantitative assessment of the statistical information in the nonlinear regime ( particularly focusing on the properties of dark energy ) provided by this fractional area statistic and its complementarity to other probes of cosmology , e.g. , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "third , besides utilizing the cosmic shear field @xcite which we will focus on in this paper , there are several other observational techniques which could be used to map out the convergence pdf .",
    "for example , with forthcoming large samples of high redshift supernovae from lsst - like or joint dark energy mission ( jdem)-like surveys , one could measure the magnification distribution of these standard candles due to lensing by the large scale structure in the foreground , and construct the convergence pdf @xcite ; it is also possible to measure the convergence field through the statistics of cosmic magnification @xcite , using , for instance , 21cm - emitting galaxies @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our basic calculational methodology , including a calibration of the ( co)variance using simulation outputs , is described in   [ sec : ii ] .",
    "results of using the fractional area statistic for an lsst - like wl survey are presented in   [ sec : iii ] , with discussions of its complementarity to other dark energy probes , as well as of various uncertainties .",
    "conclusions and implications of this work are given in ",
    "[ sec : iv ] . finally , in a series of appendices , we show the details of our calculations .",
    "consider some source galaxies detected in a wl survey , with a redshift distribution of @xmath3 and a surface density of @xmath4 .",
    "the shear field is measured from the distortion of their images .",
    "a convergence field , or sometimes called mass map , can be reconstructed from the shear field @xcite , smoothed over scale @xmath5 with a gaussian window function @xmath6 .",
    "this map is a sum of the true , smoothed convergence field and the noise field due to the randomly oriented intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies : k()=_(s)()+_(n ) ( ) .",
    "[ eq : s+n ] both fields are assumed to have zero mean and are statistically isotropic ( ensemble average is same along each line of sight ) .    under the assumption that the correlation of intrinsic ellipticities and the clustering of the source galaxies can be neglected , and no other systematic errors are present , @xcite has shown that the noise field @xmath7 can be modeled as a gaussian random field with variance : ^2_(n)_(n)^2= , [ eq : varn ] where @xmath8 is the root - mean - square value of the intrinsic ellipticity of source galaxies .",
    "the two - point correlation function of @xmath7 induced by the smoothing is c_(n)()=^2_(n ) ( - ) , where @xmath9 is the angular separation between two points in the field .",
    "the true convergence field , on the other hand , is essentially non - gaussian .",
    "its one - point pdf is skew , because @xmath10 has a minimum value , corresponding to an totally empty path between the source and the observer .",
    "the convergence without smoothing , by using born approximation , is a weighted projection along a particular line of sight of the mass density perturbation field @xcite : ( ) = ^_0d ( ) ( , ) , where @xmath11 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the over - density at comoving distance @xmath11 .",
    "taking @xmath14 everywhere along the line of sight , gives the minimum value of @xmath10 : _",
    "( s)min=_min=-^_0d ( ) , [ eq : kmin ] as the smoothing has no effect on a constant '' for a smoothed field . ] . for a fixed source plane at redshift @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath16 , the weight function",
    "is given by ( assuming a flat universe for simplicity ) : ( , _ s)=_m()^2 ( 1+z)(1-)(_s- ) , [ eq : wink ] where @xmath17 denotes the comoving distance to the source plane and @xmath18 is the heaviside step function .",
    "note that this quantity @xmath19 , which is a source of the non - gaussianity of the convergence field , depends on the source redshift and on cosmology .",
    "the covariance and the correlation function of the smoothed convergence field , using limber s approximation , are given in appendices a and c as eq .",
    "( [ eq : varkpa ] ) and ( [ eq : acfln ] )",
    ".    points with high @xmath0 in the convergence field are of both experimental and theoretical interest : not only are they related to the underlying physical density field at high fidelity , but they capture the important features of the nonlinear regime as well .",
    "mathematically , they correspond to the so - called `` excursion set '' , whose properties have been studied extensively in other similar contexts ( most famously to describe the halo mass function , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "let us consider the excursion set @xmath20 of the true smoothed convergence field at redshift @xmath15 , defined as the union of all points with @xmath21 ( see   [ sec : iii ] for including the noise field ) .",
    "the fractional area of @xmath20 is then given by ( , z_s)= d^2 , where @xmath22 is the area of the excursion set @xmath20 , and @xmath23 is the total sky coverage of a survey .",
    "@xmath10 is a statistical quantity , so the fractional area has a mean value of ( , z_s)== _ _ ( n)^d_(s)p_1(_(s ) ) , [ eq : mfa ] where @xmath24 is the one - point pdf of @xmath10 .",
    "the spatial integration cancels with @xmath25 because of the statistical isotropy of the field .",
    "similarly , the fractional area has a variance determined by the two - point pdf , which is given in appendix c by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmpcov ] ) .",
    "let us first focus on the one - point pdf of @xmath10 at different redshifts : @xmath26 , which determines the mean fractional area @xmath27 .",
    "several works have used the `` stable - clustering ansatz '' @xcite to derive the one - point pdf of the true convergence , with @xcite and without @xcite smoothing , calibrated by n - body simulations .",
    "the important conclusion of these works is that there exists a universal one - point pdf , well approximated by a two - parameter family : the variance of the reduced convergence @xmath28 and the minimum convergence @xmath19 .    in this section ,",
    "we concentrate on the constraint equations of the one - point pdf required by the normalization , the mean , and the variance @xcite . by normalizing @xmath10 to @xmath29",
    ", the constraints can be written as _",
    "-1^dp_1()&=&1 , + _ -1^dp_1()&=&0 , + _ -1^dp_1()^2&= & _ ( s)^2/^2_min .",
    "we consider three different fitting formulae for the one - point pdf of the convergence field from the literature . in the next section",
    ", we will use wl simulation outputs to assess the accuracy of the high convergence tail of these three models .",
    "the first model we consider is the log - normal distribution studied in @xcite , and is given by & & p_1(_(s))d_(s)= + & & \\{-}. only one parameter , @xmath30 , is needed to satisfy the constraint equations .",
    "the second model is the stretched gaussian distribution proposed in @xcite , p_1(_(s))d_(s)=c_norm\\{-^2}. here we closely follow the original notation , except the pdf is now written in terms of @xmath10 instead of @xmath31 . as stated earlier , the four fitting parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend only upon @xmath28 [ see eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite ] .",
    "the complication of this model is that there is a need to impose an upper limit of the convergence @xmath36 in order to get the correct variance .",
    "the third model takes the form of a modified log - normal distribution as proposed in @xcite : & & p_1(_(s))d_(s)= + & & n\\ { -}. given @xmath28 , we can uniquely specify @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 by numerically solving the three constraint equations .",
    "the dependence of these three parameters on the variance is plotted in figure  2 of @xcite .    for the analysis in this paper",
    ", we emphasize that the cosmological dependence of these pdfs , i.e. , information on dark energy , enters only through the variance of the reduced convergence , the rms value of the matter density fluctuations .",
    "however , one should keep in mind the essential difference that here the convergence variance is calculated using the nonlinear power spectrum , whereas for the cluster mass function , the variance is calculated using the linear matter power spectrum . ] : @xmath28 , and through the minimum : @xmath19 as an additional scaling factor .",
    "once the form of the convergence pdf is specified , the mean fractional area is determined by its integral [ eq .  ( [ eq : mfa ] ) ] .",
    "the ( co)variance of the fractional area for various thresholds and redshifts , @xmath40 $ ] , on the other hand , requires knowing the joint two - point pdf of the convergence field , as we can see , e.g. , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmpcov ] ) . to the best of our knowledge , among the three cases considered above",
    ", the two - point function can be computed analytically only in the log - normal model ; the results are presented in appendix c. note that we do not use the covariance matrix of the log - normal model for our actual calculations  we will instead utilize simulation outputs to directly measure the ( co)variance . the results for the log - normal model will be used only for comparison , and to justify extrapolations from simulations , as we discuss in the next section .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "before we present the results , it is useful to keep several numbers in mind .",
    "the variance of the noise field @xmath41 due to the intrinsic ellipticities of the source galaxies is the same for each redshift bin ; the variance of the true smoothed convergence field @xmath42 is @xmath43 , 0.017 and 0.025 for @xmath44 , 1.1 and 1.9 respectively .",
    "the lowest threshold @xmath45 is chosen so that the points considered are all in the tail of the underlying pdf : @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for restricting ourselves to the tail instead of using the full pdf is that the points which lie within @xmath47 of the mean probe the linear regime , where the shear field can be well approximated as gaussian . in this regime",
    "the power spectrum , which has already been studied extensively , should contain essentially all of the statistical information .",
    "figure  [ fig : dif ] shows how the fractional area statistic depends on the cosmological parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the data points in each panel are the fractional areas above different thresholds for each redshift bin in the fiducial cosmology .",
    "the lines are calculated by varying the parameter in question by @xmath50 ( and leaving all other parameters unchanged ) . for reference ,",
    "we have also shown , as the error bars , the variance measured directly from the simulations .",
    "the dependencies revealed on this figure make intuitive sense : decreasing @xmath51 ( or equivalently , increasing @xmath52 ) , increasing @xmath53 , or making @xmath49 more negative all affect the growth of structures in the direction of having larger amplitudes , which increase the shear .",
    "table  [ tab : all ] summarizes our main results for an lsst - like survey alone , as well as its combination with planck .",
    "we follow the `` self - calibration '' approach , in which we assume @xmath54 and @xmath55 are unknown , and fit separately in each redshift bin . to account for the uncertainties of the six extra nuisance parameters , instead of three @xmath0 bins , we utilize seven bins extending from @xmath56 to @xmath57 in increments of @xmath58 .",
    "we consider two scenarios for the convergence systematics : the top half of table  [ tab : all ] shows a rather pessimistic projection of the survey , where we adopt @xmath59 priors on @xmath54 and @xmath55 , corresponding to the additive and multiplicative errors already achieved by current surveys @xcite ; the bottom half of table  [ tab : all ] represents a more optimistic projection of an lsst - like survey , where we adopt a @xmath60 prior on @xmath54 and a @xmath61 prior on @xmath62 , which is the accuracy goal of future surveys .",
    "note that in the last column , we adopt a conservative approach and only include independent priors on @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ( the diagonal approximation instead of the full cmb fisher matrix ) .",
    "these three parameters are expected to be constrained by planck alone to @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively @xcite .    as noted above",
    ", the cosmological dependence of the fractional areas , similar to galaxy cluster abundance , comes in through two quantities : ( 1 ) the variance of the reduced convergence , @xmath69 , thus most sensitive to the amplitude of the density fluctuation @xmath53 ; ( 2 ) the minimum value of the convergence , @xmath19 , thus most sensitive to the matter content @xmath1 , or @xmath51 as a flat universe is assumed .",
    "however , the fractional - area statistic also provides good constraints on the dark energy equation of state , for the following reason . with planck priors for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , which are all below the @xmath59 level",
    ", an lsst - like survey can determine @xmath51 and @xmath53 very well ( to a few percent accuracy ) by using the fractional area statistic , which in turn breaks the degeneracies in the growth of structure between these two parameters and the dark energy equation of state parameters : @xmath49 and @xmath70 .",
    "we follow the _ dark energy task force _ ( detf ) report @xcite and calculate the pivot scale - factor @xmath71 , or equivalently the pivot redshift @xmath72 , where the dark energy equation of state @xmath73 is best constrained . in the pessimistic case , we find @xmath74 with @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for lsst with planck prior , where @xmath77 .",
    "this is improved to @xmath78 with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) in the optimistic case .",
    "the corresponding `` figure of merit '' is @xmath81 for the pessimistic projection , which is at the interesting level [ compared to the various stage - iii experiments ; see @xcite ] , and 760 for the optimistic scenario ; the best - constrained pivot point is also at somewhat higher redshift than other proposed probes , which gives a different degeneracy direction on the @xmath49-@xmath70 plane , so we expect good synergy between the fractional area statistic and other dark energy probes .",
    "it is also different from the main degeneracy direction for cmb anisotropies , the angular diameter distance degeneracy , which gives @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for our fiducial cosmology .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ell ] , we show the two - dimensional marginalized error contours of various cosmological parameters . as shown in the bottom panel",
    ", there is still a strong degeneracy between @xmath51 ( or equivalently @xmath1 , as we have assumed a flat universe ) and @xmath53 in the self - calibration case .",
    "consequently , this degrades the constraints of @xmath49 and @xmath70 by large factors , as shown in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : ell ] .",
    "we have found that , comparing the pessimistic scenario with the optimistic one , there is respectively , a factor of 2 and 2.5 degradation for the constraint on @xmath84 and @xmath70 ( when planck priors are added ; the degradation is more significant for the convergence - statistic only case ) .",
    "as illustrated by @xcite , the prior information of the intrinsic ellipticity noise can help to restore the dark energy constraints .",
    "we also note that the prospects for self - calibration of systematic errors of an lsst - like wl survey would be further improved if the extra information from the tomographic power spectrum or bispectrum were added in the analysis .",
    "the numbers quoted above should be interpreted as the lower bound of the cosmological sensitivities one can get from an lsst - like survey using the statistics described ( with planck priors ) . in reality , various systematics have to be considered , which we discuss next .    for an lsst - like survey",
    ", most of the source galaxies will only have photometric redshift information . to check the sensitivity of the fractional area statistic to the redshift uncertainties , we calculated the change in the source redshift which would cause a shift of the fractional area by more than its @xmath85 error .",
    "it is estimated using @xmath86 @xmath87}$ ] , where @xmath88 is the derivative of the mean fractional area with respect to source redshift .",
    "we have found that the systematic error ( bias ) of photometric redshift of the source galaxies needs to be below @xmath89 for low redshift and @xmath90 for @xmath91 , which is within the expectations of lsst [ see assumption in @xcite ] .",
    "the requirement on the photometric redshift scatter will not be a major problem , because many source galaxies for each redshift bin are needed to reconstruct the convergence field .",
    "there are also several theoretical uncertainties about the use of the fractional area statistic .",
    "one important issue is the theoretical understanding of the one - point pdf of the smoothed convergence field .",
    "similar to the case of the universal halo mass function , the one - point pdf has not been tested extensively for different cosmologies .",
    "for instance , the expression given by @xcite , though in excellent agreement with n - body simulations , has only been checked for one flat @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath92 .",
    "as the above discussion indicates , the theoretical prediction for the pdf has to be accurate at the @xmath93 1 percent level .",
    "it is conceivable that the universality might break down at this precision .",
    "however , the one - point pdf is such a simple statistic and its derivation adds almost no extra computational cost , once wl simulations are made . we expect our work will inspire currently on - going or planned large wl simulations to obtain accurately calibrated formulas for the pdf .",
    "the baryons can cool and collapse into dense regions , which changes the matter distribution within the virialized objects . the effect on the two - point statistics",
    "has been shown to be significant @xcite , and will therefore have to be modeled in the interpretation of future wl surveys .",
    "this baryonic effect would also alter the pdf tail , and thus the fractional area statistic , especially when small smoothing angles are used .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that it is possible to take into account this uncertainty through `` self - calibration '' , i.e. , constraining simultaneously the dark energy properties and the uncertain halo profile due to baryonic physics , e.g. , halo concentration .",
    "we hope to explore the utility of a similar self - calibration technique for the one - point statistic , using the halo model approach @xcite in the future .",
    "the mass - sheet degeneracy of weak lensing is not an uncertainty for the fractional area statistic .",
    "because the full pdf is measured , any offset can be determined as the mean should be zero .",
    "besides , one can in principle use the one - point pdf of the filtered tangential shear @xcite directly instead of the convergence pdf .",
    "it is also important to compare the fractional area statistic with other wl statistics .",
    "we have found that the fractional area statistic , in combination with cmb anisotropy measurements , may be able to reach a cosmological sensitivity closely approaching those from using a sample of @xmath94 shear - selected galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the two methods are very similar and related in practice , as the majority of the high @xmath0 points are candidates for being real galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the most important gain for our approach is that projection effects are not a contamination , since they depend on cosmology , and therefore serve as a source of information instead .",
    "the fractional area statistic does not suffer from the missing or false cluster problem , which is indeed the main motivation of this work .",
    "the trade - off , however , is that counting the number of clusters as a function of redshift plays a crucial role to constrain the evolution of dark energy , while the convergence field is a two - dimensional projection of all the structures along the line of sight",
    ". the tomography of the source galaxies does help , but the broad lensing kernel entangles the information from a wide range of redshifts ; tomography is also limited by the number of faint galaxies detected within each redshift bin ( in order to reconstruct a convergence field that is not shot - noise dominated ) .    the wl power spectrum tomography @xcite and the bispectrum tomography @xcite have been shown to be very powerful cosmological probes and sensitive to the evolution of dark energy . for example , @xcite find that an lsst - like survey can deliver constraints of @xmath95 and @xmath96 from lensing alone .",
    "the fractional area statistic must include additional information from higher order statistics , because the one - point pdf is determined by all orders of cumulants @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in analogy with cluster counts , the fractional area statistic is helped by the exponential sensitivity of the tail of the pdf to the cosmological parameters .",
    "the scale information , imprinted in different multipole moments of power spectrum , can be retrieved with different smoothing scales for the fractional area statistic : the linear regime of the power spectrum should be recovered by using various larger smoothing angular scales and the nonlinear regime by smaller scales . however , unlike in fourier space where different modes are independent , using different smoothing scales in real space produces mass maps that are correlated with each other . in this work ,",
    "we only utilize one particular smoothing scale @xmath97 arcmin , which is within the nonlinear regime .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in the linear regime , most of the statistical information is already contained in the two - point correlation function .",
    "interesting future work includes studying how to correctly take advantage of the information from the scale - dependence of the fractional area statistic , and its complementarity to other wl statistics .",
    "finally , we note that the fractional area statistic is known as the first minkowski functional . in the two - dimensional case , there are two other functionals : the length and the genus of the excursion set .",
    "these three minkowski functionals , which are additive and are invariant under translations as well as rotations , completely characterize the morphological properties of the high convergence regions .",
    "these functionals have been extensively studied for cmb as useful tests of the gaussianity of the primordial density perturbation field [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] . since the convergence field is definitely non - gaussian , including the other two functionals which depend on derivatives of the convergence field must yield additional cosmological information @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , in future wide field weak gravitational lensing surveys , a simple one - point statistic  the total fractional area of high @xmath0 points in the convergence field  is a promising probe of cosmology .",
    "it is sensitive to the total matter content of the universe and the amplitude of the density fluctuations , which helps breaking the intrinsic degeneracies in the growth of structure between cosmological parameters , thus constraining the properties of dark energy .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the fractional area statistic provides constraints on cosmological parameters similar to the redshift distribution of galaxy cluster abundance , but without suffering from the projection effects .",
    "indeed , the statistic is explicitly constructed to take advantage of projections as part of the signal .",
    "we expect the fractional area statistic will help achieve the goal of `` precision cosmology '' and shed light on the mystery of dark energy .",
