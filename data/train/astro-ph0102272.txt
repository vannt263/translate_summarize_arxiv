    "w ursae majoris over - contact binaries ( contact binaries here - after ) are comprised of two stars which are sufficiently close that they both overfill their roche equipotential surfaces .",
    "they are observed in the field ( e.g. rucinski 1997 , hendry & mochnacki 2000 ) , in open clusters ( rucinski & kaluzny 1994 ) and in globular clusters ( mateo et al . 1990 ; kaluzny & krzeminski 1993 ; yan & mateo 1994 ; rubenstein & bailyn 1996 ; kaluzny 1997 ; mazur , krzeminski & kaluzny 1999 ; mirabal & mateo 1999 ; thompson et al . 1999 ) . in these studies ,",
    "contact binaries typically represent roughly a tenth of a percent of the sample size .",
    "w  uma s are of great interest to the study of stellar populations because they can be used as a test of distance ( rucinski & duerbeck 1997 , rubenstein & bailyn 1996 , edmonds et al .",
    "1996 , yan & mateo 1994 ) , because even a tiny fraction of binaries can qualitatively alter the dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems ( heggie & aarseth 1992 ) , and because they are the most frequently observed type of common envelope objects .",
    "the internal structure of contact binaries is complicated due to such factors as : the tidal deformation of the components , heat flow and mass transfer between the stars , possible thermal relaxation oscillations , chromospheric activity etc .",
    "rahunen & vilhu 1977 ; webbink 1979 ; rahunen 1983 ; sarna 1991 ; jianmin 1993 ) .",
    "however , many of their properties can be derived from spectroscopic observations or via light - curve modeling ( see comprehensive text kallrath & milone 1999 ) , especially when the two are used together ( hilditch , king & mcfarlane 1988 ) . in particular , the inclination angle ( @xmath0 ) , mass ratio ( @xmath1 ) and fill - out ratio ( f ) can be described by study of the fourier components of the light - curve ( rucinski 1993 ) .",
    "wilson - devinney ( 1971 & 1973 ) type light - curve fitting ( including recent improvements kallrath , milone , terrell & young 1998 ) allows us to derive several additional stellar properties such as the surface temperature of the common envelope , and star - spot sizes , locations , and temperatures as well as @xmath0 , @xmath2 , & f ( see kallrath & milone 1999 and references within ) . as a result of these robust analyses , we have learned much about the underlying physics of contact systems .",
    "for example , we understand the origin of the period - color relation ( hereafter pcr ; eggen 1967 ) , the observation that w  uma systems which are bluer have longer orbital periods .",
    "briefly , a binary containing a massive star will be bluer than a binary comprised of lower mass stars .",
    "since massive stars are physically larger than low mass stars , binaries containing a higher mass component must have a greater orbital separation to accommodate the greater stellar volume within its roche lobe .",
    "this larger separation results in a longer period for these bluer systems .    however , the discovery of w  uma s in globular clusters ( gc s ) made it apparent that the pcr depends upon additional factors .",
    "yan & mateo ( 1994 ) demonstrated that the reduced line blanketing of metal - poor stellar atmospheres accounted for some of the difference in the gc w  uma s positions in the pcr compared to field binaries .",
    "rucinski ( 1995 ) recognized that metallicity variations will change the stellar radii and therefore the resulting orbital period of w  uma systems .",
    "he parameterized this effect by including a metallicity dependent term and found that @xmath3 [ fe / h ] for metallicity in the range @xmath4 } < + 0.5 $ ] while for [ fe / h]@xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "rucinski & duerbeck ( 1997 ) have since propagated that parameterization to the pcr ( their equations 1 - 3 ) , though they note that the significant scatter in their figure  1 arises from variations in stellar age and the resulting structural changes .",
    "recently , rucinski ( 2000 ) , used the metallicity - radius relation of castellani , deglinnocenti & marconi ( 1999 ) to determine the period changes produced by much lower than solar composition of w  uma s .",
    "he found that the period decrease was consistent with the deviation of the population ii w  uma s from the population - i binaries in the period - color plane .    in  2 of this work",
    ", i will discuss the relationship between the period and the color of w  uma systems , taking into account evolution of the components as well as structural changes arising from variations in the chemical composition of systems .",
    "i will discuss the results derived for systems comprised of equal mass components which are critically filling their inner critical surfaces .",
    "two example applications of these metallicity - age dependent period - color relations are given in  3 .",
    "the more general case of non - equal mass components and arbitrary fill - out ratios will be discussed in a forthcoming paper as will the consequences of rapid rotation .",
    "rather than try to determine what combination of `` corrections '' would translate the position of the pop  ii w  uma s onto the pop  i period - color relation ( pcr ) , it is more enlightening to determine what the location of the pcr should be for a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "the envelopes of low metallicity stars have lower opacities than those of higher metallicity stars .",
    "as noted previously ( yan & mateo 1994 , rucinski 1995 ) , this reduced opacity results in a higher effective temperature , t@xmath7 , and a bluer color .",
    "however , the lower opacity also results in a smaller stellar radius for a given mass and evolutionary state .",
    "therefore , the components of a low metallicity contact binary must be closer together than their pop  i counterparts in order to maintain a contact configuration .",
    "the resulting orbital period is shorter .",
    "the combination of these factors shifts the expected location of w  uma systems in the period - color plane . merely correcting for the reduced line - blanketing of metal - poor stellar atmospheres does not adequately model this shift ( c.f .",
    "yan & mateo 1994 and rubenstein & bailyn 1996 ) .",
    "however , the pcr for a given metallicity can be calculated using the roche lobe geometry constraint and stellar models which provide the radii of the stars of different masses and ages .",
    "specifically , the volume of the stars and the volumes of their respective roche lobes must be equal for the stars to be in critical contact ( both stars touching the inner roche potential ) . for the case of marginal contact",
    ", a unique period can be calculated for a given pair of masses and radii ( eggleton 1983 ) :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and radius of a component of the binary ( eggleton 1983 ) .",
    "the dimensionless radius , @xmath12 , and is eggleton s eq .",
    "# 2 ; @xmath13 is the stellar radius divided by the separation of the stars centers of mass . by using models which span a range of masses",
    ", the locus of a pcr can be calculated .",
    "one pcr is derived for each set of age and composition .    to study the variation of the pcr over a range of age and chemical composition , i have used stellar models from the yale isochrones ( chaboyer et al .",
    "1995 ; hereafter yi95 ) to determine the stellar radii for stars . in this work",
    "i consider stars below the main - sequence turn - off at solar composition as well as for [ fe / h]=-0.7 , -1.0 , -1.5 , -2.0 & -3.0 dex .",
    "i calculated the orbital period expected for cases where two equal mass stars are both in contact with their inner critical potential .",
    "this period and the b - v color of the stars ( from yi95 ) then define the pcr for stars having the same age and composition .",
    "the curves in the four panels of figure  [ pcol_byage ] show the pcr for these compositions at 2 , 5 , 10 & 15 gyr .",
    "how reasonable are the equal mass component and marginal contact assumptions ? most w  uma s are not in critical contact and have mass ratios significantly less than one .",
    "certainly the variation of system properties is important .",
    "however , these two restrictions serve as a useful starting point . in any event , many w  uma s are , in fact , fairly close to critical contact ; in rucinski & duerbeck s ( 1997 , hereafter rd97 ) table  1 , 15 out of 33 systems have @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e.  _ nearly in critical contact . to determine how reasonable the case of critical contact is , let us consider the variation in expected properties between an idealized system in marginal contact and a second system with an overcontact of 15% ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "the 11% variation in stellar volume between these two cases corresponds to a difference in radial separation of less than 4% ( c.f .",
    "procedure detailed in mochnacki 1984 & 1985 ) .",
    "the orbital period difference is then less than 6% ; this factor is negligible compared to the effects of both metallicity and age .",
    "furthermore , the important comparison is between systems of various age / metallicity pairs for a given degree of contact , so only the _ differential _ change in orbital period at different age / composition values is relevant and this is an even smaller effect .",
    "while the bulk of w  uma s have mass ratios significantly different from unity , there are exceptions .",
    "rd97 s table  1 indicates that three out of 33 systems have q@xmath16 .",
    "the fractional volume difference of two primaries having q=1.0 and 0.75 is only 6% , of course the period difference will be larger .",
    "as before , the procedure delineated above depends upon the differential period change between systems having different system parameters .",
    "the first order structural changes are calculated in this work .",
    "the next paper will correct for these second order effects .",
    "do solar composition w  uma s fit these calculated pcr s ?",
    "the asterisks in figure  [ pcol_byage ] mark local w  uma s from mochnacki ( 1981 ) and rucinski ( 1983 ) and the pluses mark rucinski s ( 1998 ) baade s window systems .",
    "these calibration systems are plotted in the two and five gyr panels only as it is believed that the mean age of the local w  uma s is approximately a gyr ( duerbeck 1984 ) . clearly",
    "this application of yi95 models to equal - mass component , contact configuration binaries adequately fits the calibration data for systems having approximately solar composition .",
    "what can we learn about metal - poor w  uma s ?",
    "as expected , models of metal - poor w  uma s occupy the region further to the blue / with shorter period than the more metal - rich calibration w  uma s .",
    "the solid black dots in each panel correspond to the location in the period - color plane for specific models ( 0.5 , 0.6 & 0.7 m@xmath17 , left to right ) .",
    "these show that at smaller ages , low metallicity w  uma s have shorter orbital periods for all masses . indeed , even for ages of 15 gyr , metal - poor binaries with masses @xmath18 m@xmath17 have shorter orbital periods than more metal rich systems .",
    "however , for ages typical of globular clusters , evolution _ of those stars at the turn - off _ leads to slightly _ longer _ orbital periods for critical - contact , metal - poor systems .",
    "we would like to be able to compare the observationally - based results of rd97 to those expected from these models .",
    "unfortunately , rd97 and the preceding papers by rucinski ( 1994 , 1995 and 1997 ) do not include age as a parameter since they are working with calibration objects of approximately known distance , but unknown age , rather than stellar models .",
    "likewise , rucinski ( 2000 ) does not discuss the age of components as it impacts upon the pcr .",
    "to see what the rd97 relations might look like with various age stars , the yi95 models are combined with the rd97 relationships .",
    "the luminosity and stellar volume for a given mass , age , and metallicity define a particular model . using that model ,",
    "an inferred orbital period is calculated as above , and the expected b - v color is determined from rd97 s equation # 1 .",
    "figure  [ pcol_bycomp ] shows this comparison of the metallicity - age dependent ( mad ) pcr s and rd97 s observationally based metallicity / color parameterization .",
    "the solar composition models yield nearly identical results for stars more massive than 0.4 m@xmath17 ; the deviations at smaller mass are presumably due to our limited understanding of stellar opacities for low temperature stars . in each panel , the bold lines show the relevant mad - pcr while the thin lines show the results of rd97 .",
    "the solid lines are 2 ( 5 ) gyr on the left ( right ) panels and the dashed lines are 10 ( 15 ) gyr on the left ( right ) panels .",
    "the deviations between the mad - pcr and rd97 lines are not significant since rd97 s reported @xmath19 uncertainty in magnitude is @xmath20 , implying a color uncertainty of 0.35 mag .",
    "it is therefore apparent that the structural changes which arise from the reduced opacity of pop  ii stars accounts for a significant fraction of the pcr differences for pop  i and ii stars .",
    "indeed , the shortened orbital period combined with the reduced line blanketing seem to explain the location of pop  ii contact binaries , at least given the current limited range of binary component properties .",
    "with many hundreds of field w  uma s and more than 50 systems in metal - poor globular clusters ( rucinski 2000 and references therein ) , we are strongly motivated to better test the mad - cpr s against real data .",
    "as noted above , the bulk of w  uma s have mass ratios significantly different from 1 ; for example , rd97 s table  1 indicates that three out of 33 systems have q@xmath16 . at present",
    "i will demonstrate the results of comparing two systems to the b - v mad - pcr s calculated above , and a more exhaustive comparison of known w  uma systems with this technique will be made after the current model s restrictions are relaxed .",
    "the planned work will also include v - i mad - pcr s since many contact systems are studied in those filters .    in the 15 gyr panel of figure  [ pcol_byage ]",
    "the large unfilled triangle shows the position of v1 in ngc  6397 ( rubenstein & bailyn 1996 ) .",
    "v1 falls on the mad - pcr for [ fe / h]=-2 , consistent with the composition of this globular cluster ( zinn & west 1984 ; djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "the observational errors are smaller than the size of the symbol .",
    "the agreement between the metallicity derived from this work and the cluster s known composition and estimated age ( @xmath21 gyr chaboyer , demarque & sarajedini 1996 ) is encouraging even though rubenstein & bailyn s best estimate of v1 s mass ratio is @xmath22 , rather than this work s implicit mass ratio of 1.0 .",
    "another indication of the role which future mad - pcr s might fill follows .",
    "covarrubias , duerbeck & maza ( 2001 ) found a w  uma binary roughly 1.4 kpc above the galactic plane but were uncertain whether it is a pop  i or ii object .",
    "this spectroscopically - confirmed binary has an orbital period of 0.35 day and ( b - v)@xmath23 .",
    "inspection of figures  [ pcol_byage ] & [ pcol_bycomp ] suggest that the object is likely a pop  ii binary with [ fe / h]@xmath24 dex , however , [ fe / h]@xmath25 for an age of only 2 gyr can not be ruled out on this basis .",
    "metallicity - age dependent period - color relations have been calculated to understand why population  ii contact binaries are observed to be too blue / have too short an orbital period compared to their pop  i analogs .",
    "this work confirms that the structural changes which arise from the reduced opacity of metal poor stars leads directly to shorter orbital periods .",
    "the mad - pcr s calculated agree with the empirically derived corrections ( rucinski & duerbeck 1997 ) to the period - color relation to within 1-sigma ( @xmath26 mag in b - v ) down to at least p@xmath27d .",
    "however , their parameterization does not include the effect of evolution .",
    "therefore , the predictions deviate to a greater degree as stellar age increases .    figures  [ pcol_byage ] & [ pcol_bycomp ] show the mad pcr s for a range of ages and compositions . the position of the w  uma binary `` v1 '' from the metal - poor globular cluster ngc  6397 ( rubenstein & bailyn 1996 ) is shown in the 15 gyr panel of figure  [ pcol_byage ] and the [ fe / h]=-2.0 panel of figure  [ pcol_bycomp ] .",
    "this object lands almost precisely on the mad pcr appropriate to this cluster .",
    "the success in recovering v1 s age and metallicity by looking for a best fit mad pcr suggests that this technique may provide an additional way to derive approximate cluster parameters .",
    "however , mass transfer may alter the surface abundance of he and metals in the envelope of the accreting star .",
    "therefore , any age / metallicity determinations based on this technique can only be applied to the cluster as a whole for those w  uma s which have a mass ratio close to unity to ensure that little mass transfer contamination has occurred .",
    "since most w  uma s do not have mass ratios close to unity ( rucinski & duerbeck 1997 ) , only a small fraction of contact binaries can be used to obtain age / metallicity values for their host clusters . in most instances ,",
    "this technique would be used to determine the properties of contact systems for which an age and metallicity were not known ( see  3 ) .",
    "the planned follow - up work includes extending the range of mass ratios and degree of contact to more accurately test this technique against systems with known q & f. additional stellar models having a range of helium abundance will also be calculated to determine if this technique is sensitive to the helium enhancement which likely occurs in the late stages of mass transfer , though structural changes may make this determination difficult . in any event , contact systems with mass ratios close to unity might be able to provide insight into the relative rates of chemical enrichment of helium and iron among open clusters with supra - solar abundances .",
    "finally , models of rapidly rotating stars will be used to account for changes in stellar radius and effective temperature .",
