    "nowadays , the frustrated spin systems are the subject of intensive study .",
    "@xcite the interest on them is stimulated by recent progress in synthesizing corresponding magnetic materials .",
    "@xcite in these models , due to competing interactions , the classical ground state can not be minimized locally and usually possesses a large degeneracy .",
    "the frustration can be caused by the geometry of the spin lattice or by the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "in contrast , the ground states of classical models on bipartite lattices are nel ordered and are unique up to the global spin rotations .",
    "the bipartitness means that the lattice can be divided into two sublattices @xmath0 and @xmath1 , so that all interactions within the same sublattice are ferromagnetic while the interactions between different sublattices are antiferromagnetic . for the nel state ,",
    "all spins of @xmath0 have same direction while all spins of @xmath1 are aligned in opposite direction .",
    "the quantum fluctuations destroy nel state and the quantum model , in general , has more complicated ground state .",
    "however , for bipartite spin systems , the quantum ground state inherits some properties of its classical counterpart . in particular , lieb and mattis proved that the quantum ground state of finite - size system is a unique multiplet with total spin @xmath2 , which coincides with the spin of the classical nel state . here ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the highest possible spins on corresponding sublattices .",
    "@xcite this feature of bipartite systems looks natural , since in the limit of large spin values the quantum model approaches to the classical one .",
    "moreover , a simple general rule that the energy increases with increasing spin , which is conventional for classical antiferromagnets , makes a sense in this case , too .",
    "more precisely , the lowest energy @xmath5 in the sector , where the total spin is equal to @xmath6 , is a monotone increasing function of the spin for any @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite this property is known as lieb - mattis theorem about antiferromagnetic ordering of energy levels .",
    "lieb - mattis theorem is very important because it provides information about the ground state and spectrum of bipartite spin systems without exact solution or numerical simulation .",
    "recently , it has been generalized to su(@xmath8 ) symmetric quantum chain with defining representation and nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "@xcite a ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels has been formulated and proven also for xxx heisenberg chains of any spin .",
    "@xcite    more limited number of exact results is available for frustrated quantum spin systems .",
    "it is difficult to treat even their classical ground states as was mentioned above .",
    "the usual lieb - mattis theorem is no longer valid for frustrated systems .",
    "recently , however , lieb and schupp proved rigorously that a reflection - symmetric spin system with antiferromagnetic crossing bonds possesses at least one spin - singlet ground state .",
    "@xcite moreover , under certain additional conditions , all ground states become singlets .",
    "a lot of frustrated spin systems satisfy the conditions of lieb - schupp approach .",
    "two - dimensional pyrochlore antiferromagnet having checkerboard lattice structure is an example of such type of system .",
    "@xcite another example is well - known two - dimensional antiferromagnetic @xmath9 model , namely , the heisenberg model on square lattice with diagonal interactions , which has been studied recently .",
    "@xcite note that this approach does not provide any information about the degeneracy of ground states .",
    "thus , for frustrated spin systems , this question still remains open .",
    "we mention also that the method used in refs .   and",
    "is restricted to the systems , which do not have a spin on their symmetry axis .    at the same time , recently , certain signs in favor of lieb - mattis theorem for frustrated spin systems have appeared . for @xmath9 model ,",
    "the number of arguments based on exact diagonalization and spin - wave approximation had been presented in support of the fact that the antiferromagnetic ordering of energy levels is preserved under weak frustration caused by diagonal couplings .",
    "@xcite recently , for the same model , the condition @xmath2 for the ground state spin has been tested numerically in ref .  .",
    "the authors came to the conclusion that it remains true provided that the frustration is sufficiently weak in order to destroy ground - state nel order .",
    "the lieb - mattis property had been observed also at finite size spectrum of the heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattices .",
    "@xcite all these investigations suggest that in many cases , even a relatively strong frustration can not destroy the antiferromagnetic ordering of energy levels .",
    "on the other hand , recently , the spin ladder systems have attracted much attention .",
    "the interest to them has been generated by significant progress made within the last years in fabrication of such type of compounds having a structure similar to the structure of two - dimensional high - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite ladder systems are simpler for study than their more complex two - dimensional counterparts .",
    "moreover , the powerful theoretical and numerical methods , elaborated for one - dimensional models , can be applied to study them .",
    "the two - leg ladder frustrated by diagonal interactions is one of the simplest frustrated spin systems .",
    "it can be viewed as a quasi - one - dimensional analog of @xmath9 model .",
    "together with various generalizations , it has been investigated intensively during the last decade .",
    "@xcite the ground - state phase diagram consists of two topologically distinct haldane phases separated by the curve ( or surface ) of phase transition",
    ".    inspired by aforementioned activities , in this paper we generalize the lieb - mattis ordering theorem to two - leg spin-1/2 ladder model with diagonal interactions .",
    "we consider the system , which rests invariant under the reflection with respect to the longitudinal symmetry axis of the ladder . up to our knowledge , this is the first exact result related to the energy level ordering of a frustrated spin system .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : open ] , we formulate and prove an analog of lieb - mattis theorem for frustrated spin-1/2 ladder with free boundaries . the reflection symmetry spits the total space of states into two invariant sectors , composed correspondingly from reflection - symmetric and reflection - antisymmetric states .",

    "the nondegeneracy of most levels is proved also . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gs ] , using the ordering rule and the results of lieb and schupp @xcite on reflection - symmetric spin systems , the total spin and reflection quantum numbers of the ground state are derived .",

    "we briefly summarize the results obtained in this paper . in appendix",
    ", we apply the general results for reflection - symmetric spin systems obtained in refs .   and to the frustrated ladder model .",
    "in this paper we consider two finite identical antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains coupled by rung and diagonal interactions .",

    "fig : ladder ] ) :    ladder.eepic    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the spin operators of the first and second chains respectively . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are rung and diagonal interchain couplings , while @xmath15 are intrachain couplings .",
    "the open boundary conditions are applied here .",
    "all couplings depend on site .",
    "their choice corresponds to a model possessing the reflection symmetry @xmath16 with respect to the longitudinal symmetry axis .",
    "the reflection just permutes the spins of two chains : @xmath17 .",
    "we do not put any restriction on the rung couplings @xmath18 and consider antiferromagnetic intrachain couplings only .",
    "we suppose also that the diagonal spin interactions are weaker than intrachain interactions , i.e. , @xmath19 note that the condition above is not too restrictive for antiferromagnetic values of @xmath14 because the system remains invariant under the exchange of rung and diagonal couplings @xmath20 belonging to @xmath21th box .",
    "the resulting model corresponds to a ladder obtained by permutation @xmath22 of two spins in all rungs positioned on the right from @xmath21th rung ( i.e. , for all @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is topologically equivalent to the original model .",
    "therefore , one can consider the couplings subjected to @xmath24 only without loss of generality . note that the condition excludes the values of diagonal couplings @xmath14 equal to @xmath25 .",
    "one must mention that we call the model a frustrated ladder , but , in fact , it becomes bipartite for some couplings .",
    "in particular , it is bipartite for ferromagnetic diagonal or rung interactions .",
    "these cases will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the hamiltonian preserves the total spin @xmath26 of the system .",
    "since @xmath16 and @xmath27 are compatible , the eigenstates of ( [ h ] ) can be chosen to be parametrized by the spin ( @xmath28 ) , spin projection ( @xmath29 ) , and reflection ( @xmath30 ) quantum numbers .    in order to make easier the use of the reflection symmetry",
    ", we introduce the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of two spins on each rung : @xmath31 the symmetrized spin @xmath32 describes the total spin of @xmath21th rung .",
    "it remains unchanged under reflection , i.e. @xmath33 , while the antisymmetrized rung spin acquires minus sign , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "now we express the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in terms of these operators . after omitting nonessential scalar term , the hamiltonian takes the following simple form : @xmath35 here , we have introduced the symmetrized and antisymmetrized couplings , which are antiferromagnetic due to the condition imposed above on the intrachain and diagonal couplings : @xmath36 note that does not contain terms , which mix symmetrized and antisymmetrized spin operators .",
    "this fact is a consequence of the reflection symmetry of the model .",
    "we mention also that similar decomposition for frustrated ladder hamiltonian was applied also in refs .   and .    in terms of lowering and rising operators @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 the hamiltonian reads @xmath39    further , in this section , we will show that for @xmath40 the minimal energy levels @xmath41 in the symmetric ( @xmath42 ) as well as in the antisymmetric ( @xmath43 ) spin-@xmath6 sectors are nondegenerate and ordered antiferromagnetically , i.e. , are increasing functions of @xmath6 .",
    "this is an extension of lieb - mattis ordering theorem @xcite to the frustrated ladder model . here",
    ", we briefly outline the steps of the proof .",
    "first , we construct a basis , in which all nonzero off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian become negative . in the next step ,",
    "we show that the matrix of hamiltonian being restricted to the subspace of states with fixed values of spin projection @xmath44 and reflection @xmath45 quantum numbers is connected . then according to perron - frobenius theorem , the lowest - energy state in every such subspace , called a _ relative ground state _ , is nondegenerate .",
    "as we will show , the relative ground state in most cases has total spin value equal to absolute value of its @xmath46 projection ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "together with the total spin symmetry of the hamiltonian this implies that the multiplet , to which the relative ground state belongs , possesses the lowest energy value among all spin-@xmath6 multiplets .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordering between lowest energy levels @xmath41 follows then directly from their nondegeneracy .",
    "the existence of a basis , where all off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are nonpositive , is not obvious as it is for nonfrustrated models .",
    "the spin flip applied on one sublattice @xcite is adopted for bipartite systems and does not lead to the desired basis for frustrated systems . in this subsection",
    ", we construct nonpositive basis for the frustrated ladder model .",
    "the first step is the use of the basis consisting of combined spin states on each rung instead of the standard ising basis consisting of on - site spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "then we apply a unitary shift to the hamiltonian , which makes all nonvanishing off - diagonal elements arising from the symmetric part of negative . in the final step ,",
    "all basic states are multiplied by a sign factor making all nonvanishing off - diagonal matrix elements negative .",
    "it is rather difficult to trace out the sign of matrix elements of @xmath48 in the ising basis , consisting of on - site spin states .",
    "instead , we start with a more suitable basis consisting of combined spin states on every rung .",

    "the total space of states is spanned by the basic states @xmath54 here @xmath55 is one of the four rung states defined above .",
    "the reflection operator @xmath16 is diagonal in this basis .",
    "its quantum number is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number of singlets in .",

    "the odd - rung lowering - rising operators change the sign ( @xmath63 ) , while the others remain unchanged .",
    "recall that for bipartite models , a similar unitary shift applied to the spins of one sublattice makes all off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian nonpositive .",
    "@xcite in our case , the hamiltonian ( [ h - spm ] ) transforms to @xmath64 it is easy to see that @xmath65 part of the hamiltonian , presented by the last sum in ( [ h - u ] ) , is diagonal in the basis because it consists of the squares of rung spin operators .",
    "the next observation is that @xmath66 part of the hamiltonian @xmath67 gives rise to negative off - diagonal elements .",
    "indeed , the symmetrized spin operators describe the spin of rung state and act separately on singlet and triplet states in the usual way .",
    "all their off - diagonal matrix elements are positive : @xmath68 taking into account the fact that the coefficients @xmath69 are antiferromagnetic [ see ] , it is easy to see that all nonvanishing off - diagonal elements of the shifted hamiltonian , which are generated by terms containing symmetrized spin operators , are negative .    finally , we consider the matrix elements produced by the antisymmetric local terms of hamiltonian . in",
    "contrary to symmetric case , the antisymmetrized spin operators mix triplet and singlet states .",

    "the sign factor does not affect on other matrix elements .",
    "the remaining action just permutes the singlet and @xmath78 triplet states . in order to make this term negative ,",
    "introduce the ordering between pair of rung states @xmath79 and @xmath80 inside multirung state .",
    "we say that a pair is ordered if @xmath80 is located on the left - hand side from @xmath79 .",
    "denote by @xmath81 the number of disordered pairs in , i.e. , the number of pairs @xmath82 , where @xmath79 is on the left - hand side from @xmath83 .",
    "note that the nearest - neighbor actions change the ordering of only one pair .",
    "therefore , if we multiply a basic state by another sign factor @xmath84 , all matrix elements generated by will change the sign and become negative . at the same time",
    ", other matrix elements will hold unchained .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see , that the nearest - neighbor permutations @xmath85 and @xmath86 do not change the number of disordered pairs @xmath81 while pair creations and annihilations ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) change its value on _ even _ number .",

    ". keeping the terminology , we call it @xmath90 subspace .",
    "below , we outline the proof that the matrix of the hamiltonian in basis being restricted on every @xmath90 subspace is connected .",
    "note that due to all local actions considered in , contribute in the hamiltonian with nonvanishing coefficients .",
    "it is easy to verify using , , and that any two adjacent states @xmath91 and @xmath92 are connected by the @xmath21th local terms of the hamiltonian provided that their quantum numbers are subjected to the conservation laws . in other words",

    "this rule can be generalized by induction to any two basic states . in fact",
    ", any symmetric ( @xmath42 ) basic state after successive applications of the local terms in can be transformed to state @xmath93 , where plus ( minus ) sign holds for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath94 .",
    "similarly , any antisymmetric ( @xmath43 ) state is connected to state @xmath93 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the connectivity .",
    "now all conditions of perron - frobenius theorem @xcite are fulfilled and one comes to the following result .",
    "the state @xmath95 must have a definite value @xmath96 of total spin quantum number .",
    "otherwise , it could be presented as a superposition of independent states with different spins but the same energy .",
    "this would be in contradiction with the uniqueness condition established above .",
    "it is evident that if some spin-@xmath6 state overlaps with the relative ground state @xmath95 then @xmath97 .",
    "below , we use this property in order to determine @xmath96 .    due to the spin reflection symmetry @xmath98 .",
    "so , one can consider only non - negative values of @xmath94 .",
    "first , we suppose that @xmath99 .    if @xmath100 , then the state @xmath101 , which is the highest weight state for a spin @xmath102 multiplet , contributes in the sum .",
    "therefore , it overlaps with the relative ground state . according to the arguments above , @xmath103 for this case .    else",
    "if @xmath104 , then both states @xmath105 and @xmath106 are also presented in the decomposition of @xmath95 with _ positive _ coefficients . according to the definition of basic states , their sum , up to a nonessential sign factor , can be presented as @xmath107 and , of course , overlaps with . in fact , @xmath108 has a definite spin value , which we will determine now .",
    "remember we are currently working with the hamiltonian , obtained from the original one by unitary shift .",
    "turning back to @xmath48 representation , we have to shift the states back .",
    "thus , the original state is @xmath109 up to an overall sign factor .",
    "the first term of the product is the highest state of the triplet in the decomposition of two triplets , while the second term is the highest state of @xmath110 multiplet .",
    "together they form an @xmath102 multiplet . therefore ,",
    "@xmath103 in the case of @xmath104 , too .",
    "consider now the two subspaces with @xmath111 .",
    "if @xmath112 , the state constructed from rung singlets participates in the sum , so the relative ground state is a spin singlet too : @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 , the triplet state @xmath115 enters in the sum , and , therefore , the relative ground state is a triplet , i.e. , @xmath116 .    summarizing the results , we arrive at the following conclusion :      consider now the restriction of the hamiltonian to the sector containing states with fixed values of the total spin and reflection quantum numbers .",
    "apparently , the relative ground state @xmath95 is also the lowest - energy state in the sector characterized by @xmath117 and @xmath45 .",
    "denote by @xmath41 the lowest energy level in that sector . according to the previous subsection ,",
    "the relative ground state is unique on @xmath90 subspace .",
    "therefore , the level @xmath41 with @xmath117 must be nondegenerate , i.e. , it must contain only one spin-@xmath6 multiplet with parity @xmath118 .",
    "this is just the multiplet , which encloses the state @xmath95 itself .",
    "using , it is easy to see that any level @xmath41 is nondegenerate in this regard , except perhaps the one with @xmath119 and @xmath114",
    ".    moreover , every @xmath90 subspace contains a representative from any multiplet with parity @xmath118 and spin @xmath120 .",

    "its spin has the value @xmath121 provided that @xmath122 .",
    "the uniqueness of relative ground state then implies that all levels @xmath41 with spin @xmath123 are higher than the level with @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , @xmath41 is a monotone increasing function of @xmath6 . if @xmath114 , then the last equation is true for @xmath124 only and , hence , @xmath41 increases in the range @xmath125",
    "finally , we arrive at the following conclusion .",
    "the ordering rule above enables to determine the total spin of the minimum - energy states in the symmetric and antisymmetric sectors . in other words , for frustrated ladder with even number of rungs ,",
    "the ground state in the symmetric sector is a singlet state , while in the antisymmetric sector , it is formed by the three states of a triplet . in contrary , for odd number of rungs , it is a singlet in the antisymmetric sector , while in the symmetric sector , it consists of three triplet states .",
    "the ordering rule does not compare energy levels in symmetric ( @xmath42 ) sector with the levels in antisymmetric ( @xmath43 ) sector .",
    "it is clear that the total ground state coincides with the minimum - energy state in either symmetric or antisymmetric sector . if the lowest levels in both sectors coincide , the total ground state becomes degenerate .",
    "using also the results of previous section , we come to the following conclusion .",
    "the frustrated ladder in certain parameter region belongs to a large class of reflection - symmetric models considered recently by lieb and schupp .",
    "@xcite in appendix , the rigorous results obtained in ref .",

    "in contrast to the model with free boundary conditions studied in sec .  [ sec : open ] , here we can not apply the lieb - schupp results @xcite in order to choose the valid quantum numbers for the ground state .",

    "@xcite this is in agreement with our results , which assert that it should be _ at most _ doubly degenerate . therefore , the relative ground states in symmetric and antisymmetric @xmath94 subspaces have the same energy levels .",

    "hence , there is a @xmath122 singlet among the ground states if two interchain coupling constants satisfy @xmath278 this relation can be generalized to the ladder model with site - dependent couplings .",
    "setting @xmath279 , one reduces the general region to @xmath280 here , as before , the boundary conditions @xmath281 and @xmath282 are applied for open and periodic ladders correspondingly .",
    "another important property of reflection - symmetric spin systems established exactly in refs .   and",
    "is that for any crossing bond , the expectation of the spin of its all sites , weighted by their coefficients , vanishes for _ any _ ground state @xmath283 . using this feature of ground states",
    ", it was proved that in a system with sufficient symmetry , so that every spin can be considered to be involved in a crossing bond , _ all _ ground states are spin singlets .",
    "as was already mentioned , for frustrated ladder , there are rung bonds and square bonds , which are described correspondingly by the first and second term in .",
    "the aforementioned condition means that @xmath284",
    "if @xmath285 and @xmath286 , where @xmath32 is the spin operator of @xmath21th rung . therefore , if @xmath287 , then the expectation of total spin of each square bond vanishes also , i.e. , @xmath288 . applying this to the ladder with site - independent spin exchange , one can ensure that all its ground states are singlets provided that the interchain couplings satisfy @xmath289 indeed , using aforementioned parametrization of @xmath290 and taking sum over all square bonds , we get @xmath291 for periodic ladder and any ground state @xmath283 .",
    "for the open ladder , one must add two boundary rung bonds with coefficients @xmath292 and @xmath293 in order to obtain the last equation .",
    "so , if @xmath294 , then any ground state is a singlet .",
    "consider now the ladder with site - dependent spin exchange and set again @xmath279 in .",
    "note that if all @xmath295 , which makes strict the inequality sign in , then due to the discussions above the mean value of the spin of every rung vanishes for any ground state .",
    "therefore , all ground states are singlets if @xmath296 .",
    "then the ground - state mean value of the total spin of each such bond vanishes as has been mentioned above .",
    "taking the sum over all square bonds for the periodic ladder and the sum over half of square bonds in checkerboard order for the open ladder with even number of rungs , we obtain the zero expectation for the total spin of the model provided that @xmath297    for the open ladder with odd number of rungs , one of the boundary rung spins must be added to that sum .",
    "the ground state then is a singlet if the corresponding coefficient [ @xmath298 or @xmath299 in ] is nonzero .",
    "this means that the inequality in one of the two boundary relations in must be strict , i.e. , @xmath300 or @xmath301 .        c.  lhuillier and g.  misguich , in _ high magnetic fields : applications in condensed matter physics and spectroscopy _ , lecture notes in physics vol .",
