    "in the local universe , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has greatly enhanced our understanding of galaxy properties .",
    "studies of sdss data have revealed insights into the nature of star formation and quenching ( e.g. , goto et al .",
    "2003 ; brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 ) , properties of clusters and their member galaxies ( e.g , gmez et al .  2003 ; hansen et al .  2009 ; von der linden et al .",
    "2010 ) , relationships between fundamental observable quantities ( e.g. , bernardi et al .  2003 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ; blanton et al .",
    "2005 , la barbera et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and their host galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .  2003 ; kewley et al .  2006 ; yan et al .",
    "such studies , however , are , by themselves , of limited use in the context of galaxy evolution as they provide only a snapshot of the result of galaxy processing over a hubble time .",
    "it is only by comparing such galaxies to those at higher redshifts that galaxy evolution can be fully investigated",
    ".    at high redshifts , there exist several surveys ( e.g. , zcosmos , deep2 , vvds ) that contain both large samples of uv / optical spectra necessary to characterize star - formation activity , stellar ages , and metallicities and the high - resolution multiwavelength data necessary to characterize morphologies , agn contributions , and stellar masses .",
    "these surveys have been instrumental in probing the nature of galaxy evolution both in the field and intermediate - density regimes ( e.g. , ilbert et al .",
    "2005 ; cooper et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; faber et al .  2007 ;",
    "prez - montero et al .",
    "2009 ; cucciati et al .",
    "2010 ) . by comparing the evolution of fundamental relationships , such as , e.g. , mass - metallicity , morphology / color@xmath7density , and star formation rate ( sfr)@xmath7density , between @xmath1 and the present day ,",
    "a picture of galaxy evolution in such environments has begun to emerge .",
    "the number density of star - forming , blue late - type galaxies in group environments decreases significantly from @xmath1 to @xmath4 , with a corresponding rise in the number density of red , quiescent early - type galaxies ( etgs ; poggianti et al .",
    "2008 ; balogh et al .  2009 ;",
    "tasca et al .  2009 ; wilman et al .",
    "2009 ; mcgee et al .",
    "similarly , the red / early - type fraction correlates weakly with local density at @xmath1 , with red galaxies only slightly preferring overdense environments . at lower redshifts",
    "this correlation becomes stronger ; the fraction of red galaxies in low - mass group environments increases significantly from @xmath1 to lower redshifts , while remaining essentially unchanged in field environments ( e.g. , cooper et al .  2007 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the highest density environments present in such surveys ( i.e. , low - mass groups ) play the most prominent role in this picture .",
    "however , the limited range of environments present in such surveys limits the conclusions that can be drawn from these data .",
    "due to the scarcity of massive galaxy associations , these surveys contain limited information on intermediate - density ( i.e. , rich group ) and high - density ( i.e. , cluster ) environments .",
    "this is problematic for galaxy evolution studies , as it has long been known ( butcher & oemler 1984 ) that such environments are instrumental in the transformation of galaxies . in the last half decade ,",
    "surveys of higher redshift clusters extending to several times the virial radius at @xmath80.5 ( e.g. , treu et al .  2003 ; dressler et al .  2004 ;",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "2006 ; ma et al .  2008 , 2010 ;",
    "oemler et al .  2009 ) and the innermost cores of clusters at @xmath1 ( e.g. , postman et al .",
    "2005 ) seem to support this claim , as galaxies in rich groups and clusters show strong differential evolution relative to the field over the last @xmath9 gyr .    the lack of comprehensive data sets of cluster galaxies at the same redshift range as these surveys means that the processes responsible for driving this evolution in galaxy clusters and high mass groups are still not well understood .",
    "this is partly due to the sheer number of processes that galaxies are subjected to in high - density environments that are either not present or less effective in the field ( e.g. , ram - pressure stripping , harassment , strangulation , tidally induced merging , and tidal stripping ) .",
    "the overlapping spheres of influence of each effect and the requirement of high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectral data necessary to precisely quantify star formation histories ( sfhs ) , separate from the effects of stellar mass and metallicity , make disentangling these processes both extremely complicated and observationally expensive . though several studies have attempted such analyses , there is significant disagreement as to the primary mechanism responsible for driving galaxy evolution in cluster environments ( see , e.g. , the literature review in oemler et al .",
    "this disagreement is likely due , at least in part , to the spread in global properties of cluster galaxy populations , as well as the varying galaxy selection functions for each study and the clustocentric radius to which they extend .",
    "furthermore , as discussed extensively in moran et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the dominant mechanism responsible for galaxy transformation in the cluster environment is likely to vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "processes like ram - pressure stripping will be more effective in virialized , massive clusters , while merging and low - velocity tidal interactions should be more prevalent in lower mass systems . as such , in order to gain a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution in these environments from @xmath1 to the present day , it is necessary to study the galaxy populations of high - redshift clusters that encompass a wide range of both dynamical states and masses .",
    "one manifestation of cluster - specific evolution is the cluster red sequence . at lower redshifts ,",
    "massive virialized galaxy clusters are marked by a tight sequence of red galaxies observed in color@xmath7magnitude space ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1992 ; van dokkum et al.1998 ; terlevich et al .  2001",
    "; lpez - cruz et al .",
    "2004 ; haines et al .  2006 ) . at higher redshift",
    ", clusters observed to be dynamically young and x - ray underluminous show increasing scatter in their red sequences as well as a significant deficit of low - luminosity red - sequence galaxies ( rsgs ; e.g. , de lucia et al .",
    "2004 , homeier et al .  2006a ; mei et al .",
    "2009 ) , a clear sign that the red sequence is still being assembled .",
    "the question of which primary mechanism is responsible for building up the red sequence , a question intimately related to the transformation of blue late - type galaxies into quiescent etgs , is , however , still not settled ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    "standard galaxy scenarios predict the bulk of star formation to occur in brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) primarily at @xmath10 , with fainter luminosity red - sequence members forming the bulk of their stars at progressively later epochs . thus , by studying galaxy clusters at @xmath1 , only 4 gyr after the nominal formation epoch of bcgs , it is possible to observe clusters in their early stages of assembly .",
    "this paper is the first in a series studying the spectral , color , and morphological properties of galaxy clusters and high- to intermediate - mass groups at @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we present the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) magnitude , color , and morphological properties as well as the composite keck i / ii low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) and deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",

    "in addition , we present stellar masses of the galaxy populations that comprise the eight groups and clusters of the cl1604 supercluster .",
    "these stellar masses are used to investigate the buildup of the red sequence in these structures independent of star - formation effects , as even small amounts of star formation can significantly alter galaxy magnitudes ( bruzual 2007 ) . in future papers we will extend this work to investigate the sfr@xmath7density and morphology / color@xmath7density relationships of cl1604 galaxies as well as galaxy populations of other @xmath1 large scale structures as part of the observations of redshift evolution in large scale environments ( orelse ) survey ( lubin et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter l09 ) .",
    "the virtues of the current observational data sets in the orelse fields include multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy across large areas , extending to several virial radii in most fields , and uniform field - to - field selection functions used to target galaxies for spectroscopy .",

    "since many of the results presented in this paper rely on the comparison of the member galaxy populations of the eight spectroscopically confirmed clusters and groups in the cl1604 supercluster , we define here our criteria for cluster or group membership .",
    "our general philosophy is to err on the side of being overly inclusive , such that we include all galaxies that could potentially be associated with the cluster and to include a large range of environments . for the majority of the cluster and group systems we consider a galaxy a member of a particular system if it satisfies @xmath56 @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the velocity offset of a galaxy from the systemic velocity of the group or cluster and @xmath59 is the group or cluster velocity dispersion , and @xmath60 @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the projected radial offset of a galaxy from the group or cluster center and @xmath63 is the virial radius .",

    "thus , we choose to ignore this error for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the virial radius for each system is defined in terms of the radius at which the mean density is equal to 200 times the critical density of the universe at the redshift of that group or cluster ( @xmath64 ) , such that @xmath65 ( biviano et al .",

    "this observation is consistent with preliminary velocity dispersion measurements of the members of group c using new data obtained since the publication of k11 . in this measurement",
    "we observe a significant increase in the velocity dispersion relative to the value reported in k11 , suggesting that we have underestimated the virial radius of group c by adopting the k11 value . as such",
    ", we relax the projected radius criterion for this group , considering any galaxy a member if it lies within @xmath57 and @xmath72 of the group center . using these and",

    "( ii ) _ be directly or indirectly responsible for both the quenching and the morphological transformation of this population , with the morphological transformation occurring over a longer timescale than the quenching of star formation . while it has been shown that in field environments at @xmath1 merging activity is largely not responsible for quenching processes associated with populations transitioning onto the red sequence ( mendez et al .",

    "2007 ) , the relative number of blue ellipticals and red passive spiral / s0 galaxies in these systems suggests that _ in lower mass clusters and groups the quenching of star formation occurs prior to morphological transformation in only roughly @xmath174% of cases_.    it is not clear what exactly makes the morphological and color transformations of the constituent galaxies of cluster b different from those of the other clusters and groups .",
    "cluster b is the only system in the supercluster which exhibits both a bright icm and a galaxy population that is dynamically unrelaxed .",
    "it is possible that the confluence of these two physical conditions results in transformations that do not occur when only a dominant icm ( as in cluster a ) or a dynamically unrelaxed galaxy population ( as in cluster d ) is present .",

    "( 2007 ) , in which galaxies on the red sequence transition there through both early and late quenching processes and buildup mass through dry mergers .",
    "the relative importance of these early and late quenching processes seems , however , to vary greatly from system to system in the cl1604 supercluster .",
    "while the mass of the typical galaxy affected by late quenching processes correlates well with the global dynamical state of a system , the efficiency of early quenching does not seem to correlate well with either the global dynamical state or the optically derived mass of the system . in all systems",
    "it appears that dry merging or minor mixed merging likely plays a significant role in building up the mass of the bcg from @xmath1 to @xmath4 , but it is unclear how important such processes are in the mass evolution of low- to intermediate - mass rsgs . to fully characterize the relative importance of quenching and merging processes at @xmath1 , as well as to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for these processes ,",
    "it is necessary to study a statistical sample of high - redshift groups and clusters . in a future paper",
    "we will use the full orelse sample , consisting of over 40 high - redshift group and cluster systems , to investigate these questions .",
    "in this paper we studied the properties of the 525 spectroscopically confirmed members of the cl1604 supercluster at @xmath0 , focusing in particular on the 305 member galaxies of the eight clusters and groups that comprise the supercluster . with this spectroscopic sample ,",
    "unprecedented for large scale structures at this redshift , we explored the magnitude , color , stellar mass , spectral , morphological , and radial properties of cluster and group galaxies at @xmath0 . through this exploration",
    "we gained a cohesive picture of galaxy evolution and the buildup of the red sequence in the cl1604 supercluster .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * considering the color and magnitude properties of the cl1604 members , we found that a large fraction of the rsgs ( and nearly all of the bright ones ) are contained within the group and cluster environments .",
    "the red - sequence fraction of _ both _ the cluster and composite group populations is 47% , compared with only 23% in the supercluster  field \" .",
    "many bright rsgs are observed in several of the group systems , suggesting significant pre - processing is occurring in these environments at @xmath0 . * measuring the composite spectral properties of member galaxies of the cl1604 clusters , we found the average cluster galaxy at @xmath0 exhibited features indicative of a star - forming galaxy , forming stars at a level roughly between field galaxies at @xmath1 and cluster galaxies at @xmath107 .",
    "while the average galaxy in the groups of the cl1604 supercluster exhibited a large variety of spectral properties , combining all group galaxies in to a single population , we found that the average group galaxy at @xmath0 was undergoing a starburst . *",
    "an analysis of the red - sequence lf of the member galaxies of the three cl1604 clusters and a composite population of the member galaxies of the five cl1604 groups ( i.e. , the  groups \" sample ) revealed differences in the number of bright galaxies in each of the systems .",
    "bright ( @xmath208 ) red galaxies were observed in the two most massive clusters ( a & b ) as well as the groups .",
    "however , such galaxies were noticeably absent from the least massive cluster ( cluster d ) .",
    "we also observed a significant deficit of low - luminosity ( @xmath209 ) red - sequence galaxies in all systems except the most relaxed cluster of the cl1604 supercluster ( cluster a ) , suggesting that low - luminosity galaxies have largely not transitioned onto the red sequence by @xmath0 . * while bright blue galaxies are observed in all systems , massive ( @xmath210 ) blue galaxies are observed almost exclusively in cluster d and the groups .",
    "the few massive blue galaxies that belong to the galaxy population in cluster b tend to avoid the cluster core .",
    "the bright blue galaxies observed in the two most massive cl1604 clusters ( a & b ) are primarily low - mass galaxies at low clustocentric radii .",
    "this population has an average ssfr considerably higher than the low - mass galaxies observed in cluster d and the groups , suggesting that the cores of these massive clusters are inducing star formation in such galaxies . * a large fraction of brightest and most massive rsgs in the cl1604 cluster systems",
    "are observed at low clustocentric radii . in the group systems ,",
    "massive and bright rsgs are observed in a continuous distribution out to a projected distance @xmath71 from the group centers .",
    "a large population of bright , lower mass [ @xmath211 rsgs is observed at the center of cluster d , suggestive of a population that has recently transitioned onto the cluster red sequence . * a large fraction of the rsgs observed in both the clusters and groups",
    "was found to be morphologically early type .",
    "transitional populations of red passive disks and blue etgs are observed in differing amounts in all systems , primarily in the stellar mass range @xmath168-@xmath171 , suggesting that this mass range is instrumental in the buildup of the red sequence at @xmath0 . in cluster b",
    "we found that galaxies transitioning to the red sequence were quenched of their star formation largely prior to their morphological transformation . in the lower mass cluster and the group systems the quenching of star formation",
    "was found to occur prior to morphological transformation for only @xmath212% of transitional galaxies . *",
    "the average stellar populations of rsgs within @xmath180 of the two most massive cl1604 clusters are broadly consistent with formation through a single burst of star formation at @xmath183 .",
    "surprisingly , the average stellar population of the group rsgs within @xmath180 of the group centers are found to be consistent with formation through a single burst at even higher redshifts ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "in contrast , the average red galaxy in the cluster d , the least massive cl1604 cluster , is found to have only recently transitioned on to the cluster red sequence .",
    "* massive cluster galaxies [ @xmath201 ] with properties similar to those observed in bcgs at @xmath4 are absent from all cl1604 clusters and groups at @xmath0 .",
    "we suggest that either dry merging or minor mixed merging may be important in building up such galaxies from @xmath0 to @xmath4",
    ". this topic will be the subject of a future study .",
    "* galaxies transitioning on to the red sequence were found to be at significantly different masses in each of the cluster and group systems in the cl1604 supercluster .",
    "furthermore , this mass was found to correlate well with the dynamical state of the system , in that the typical mass of such a galaxy decreased with increased virialization .",
    "we presented evidence for  dynamical downsizing \" , a process in which massive blue cloud galaxies are quenched earliest in the most dynamically relaxed systems and at progressively later times in dynamically unrelaxed systems .",
    "while this work represents only a case study of galaxy evolution in dense environments at @xmath0 , it is important to note that the supercluster structure contains three clusters and five groups at essentially a single epoch .",
    "furthermore , the cl1604 clusters and groups are largely isolated from one another and are in very different stages of assembly . though we stress that conclusions drawn from a study of a single structure or even several groups and clusters at high redshift are limited in their capacity to constrain the processes governing galaxy evolution , the comprehensive dataset available for this system has allowed us to study the galaxy population in this particular collection of groups and clusters in great detail . in future work",
    "we will extend this analysis to the remaining 19 orelse fields , minimizing the effects of cosmic variance and allowing us to study galaxy evolution in a statistical sample of groups and clusters at high redshift .",

    "2009 , , 508 , 1217      initial photometry of the lfc @xmath18 imaging of the cl1604 field was performed with sextractor run in dual - image mode .",
    "this process involved the use of a deep combined @xmath18 frame for object detection , while magnitudes were measured in the individual band images .",
    "variable diameter elliptical apertures were used , with major axis radius 2@xmath214 , where @xmath214 is the kron radius ( kron 1980 ; bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , outputted as mag_auto in sextractor .",
    "these apertures are determined in the deep images and used to extract the photometry in each of the individual band images .",
    "the virtue of this process is that a single , identical aperture is used for the photometry in all three bands , which reduces biases introduced to color measurements by integrating the light within the same physical scale for each galaxy ( lubin et al .",
    "2000 ) . a full discussion of this process can be found in gal et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    following these initial steps ,",
    "the lfc data were calibrated to sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) imaging , which spanned the entirety of our two lfc pointings in the cl1604 field .",
    "the lfc @xmath18 magnitudes were compared to sdss  _ modelmags _ \" for all objects that were detected in both the lfc and sdss imaging .",
    "the sdss _ modelmags _ have the advantage that , while still using a single aperture to measure the photometry in each band , a s@xmath215rsic model ( i.e. , either an exponential disk or a de vaucouleurs profile ) is fit to each object in the @xmath20 band and applied to each individual band image to correct for the effects of using a finite aperture .",
    "the model is truncated for each galaxy measurement such that @xmath21699.3% of the ( model dependent ) flux from each galaxy is recovered in the @xmath20 band , with a similar percentage recovered in the other bands . while the sdss imaging does not go nearly as deep as our own lfc imaging , this calibration process allowed us to make bulk corrections to our lfc magnitudes , which results in more self - consistent photometry and less aperture - induced bias when comparing our optical magnitudes to those in the nir .",
    "further details on this calibration process can be found in g08 .",
    "the photometry of the wirc @xmath217 imaging was obtained by running sextractor on the final images , with object detection performed on a @xmath218 pixel gaussian smoothed image .",
    "all objects with more than 8 contiguous pixels above @xmath219 were cataloged . the photometric zero point for each deep image",

    "magnitudes from the wirc data were drawn from the sextractor output mag_auto .",
    "it is important to note that , since this reduction was done independently of the lfc reduction , the physical scale of the aperture used to compute the wirc magnitudes is not necessarily the same one used in the optical imaging . however , a comparison of the @xmath222-corrected @xmath23 wirc magnitudes and ukirt @xmath25-band magnitudes ( which are aperture corrected , see below ) for a subset of the spectroscopically confirmed members of the cl1604 supercluster exhibits only a small systematic offset ( @xmath223 mag ) in the wirc magnitudes for the very brightest and faintest galaxies in the supercluster . for a majority of the supercluster members",
    "there is no systematic offset between the two sets of magnitudes .",
    "we also make further attempts to correct zero - point offsets between filters when performing the sed fitting ( see  [ sedfitting ] ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that the small systematic offsets between the @xmath23 band and magnitudes measured from our other imaging does not introduce significant biases into our fitting process , especially in the case of supercluster members .    _",
    "spitzer _ irac 3.6/4.5/5.8/8.0@xmath27 m photometry was obtained with sextractor run in dual - image mode . for these data",

    "the only important feature of this photometry is that it be self - consistent between the two _ hst _ acs bands , which we have ensured by choosing a common aperture to measure the magnitudes in each band .    the ukirt @xmath25-band imaging , as with the _ hst _ acs data , was not used in our sed fitting .",

    "photometry catalogs of the ukirt observations are provided by the cambridge pipeline .",
    "an aperture corrected magnitude with a fixed aperture of 2@xmath24 (  kapermag3 \" in the cambridge nomenclature ) was chosen for all cl1604 member galaxies as it most closely resembled the methodology used for obtaining magnitudes in the other imaging data . while we again did not make any attempt to match the apertures of the ukirt @xmath25-band magnitudes to those in other bands , the aperture correction performed on these magnitude measurements should , in principle , allow for consistent comparison between these data and those in other bands .",
    "was performed on the member galaxies within a certain range of colors and magnitudes ( gladders et al .",
    "1998 ; stott et al.2009 ) .",
    "the color range was defined by an initial  by eye \" estimate of the color range of the red sequence of each system , while the magnitude limits were defined as the limit at which photometric errors were reasonably small ( @xmath226 ) . for most systems these resulted in a magnitude limit of @xmath94 and a color range of @xmath227 . following the results of the fitting",
    ", the color slope of each system is removed and the resulting  corrected \" color distribution of the galaxies in each system is fit to a single gaussian using iterative @xmath228 clipping .",
    "the formal red sequence is then defined as the color@xmath7magnitude envelope bounded by a @xmath229 departure from the relationship given in equation [ eqn : rs ] .",
    "the slope , intercept , and width of the red sequence for each of the three cl11604 clusters are given in table [ tab : rsparameters ] .",
    "fitting was performed on galaxies within a projected radius of @xmath63 , 1.5@xmath63 , and 2@xmath230 , but we find that there is little difference between the three fits . in this paper",
    "we used the values derived using @xmath160 , as there is minimal contamination from bluer galaxies in most of the systems at these radii .    while we performed red sequence fitting on the individual populations of each of the three clusters ( i.e. , a , b , & d ) , there are too few members in any individual group system for us to perform the fitting on a single group .",
    "instead , the individual group populations were combined into one  group \" sample .",
    "red sequence fitting was performed on this composite population in each of the three radial bins ( @xmath63 , 1.5@xmath230 , and 2@xmath230 ) using the methodology described above . a single  group",
    "\" red - sequence fit is reported in table [ tab : rsparameters ] .",
    "this fit is used to discriminate red and blue galaxies in each of the individual group systems .    since the cl1604 groups contain populations of galaxies at moderately different redshifts , the _ hst _ acs observations probe slightly different rest - frame colors for each group , which tends to artificially inflate the scatter in the combined cmd .",
    "however , we compute a maximum difference of @xmath231 for an elliptical template ( maraston 1998 , 2005 ) spanning the redshift range of the cl1604 groups . this value does not change significantly when",
    "an equivalent model from bruzual ( 2007 ) is used .",
    "while this effect is not trivial for precision measurements , here we simply adopted the best - fit relation in observed color@xmath7magnitude space for the combined group sample and used the @xmath232 departure from this relation as the boundaries of the group red sequence .",
    "the choice of the latter is motivated by the redshift effects discussed above , which artificially inflate the observed color scatter at roughly the @xmath233 level .",
    "the @xmath234 width of the group red sequence corresponds to a slightly higher width than the @xmath228 width of any of three cl1604 clusters , which may be expected of systems still in the process of formation ( i.e. , homeier et al .",
    "2006a ; mei et al .",
    "2009 ) .      to estimate the error and any possible biases spectroscopic",
    "selection effects and incompleteness might have on the quantities measured from composite spectra [ i.e. , ews and @xmath85 ] we performed a bootstrap analysis on the composite spectra of all cl1604 groups and clusters .",
    "bootstrap analysis was performed using a combination of the _ hst _ acs photometry and the deimos / lris spectroscopic information in the following manner .",
    "the observed acs cmd for the cl1604 supercluster was separated into bins spanning 0.5 mag in color and 1 mag in brightness . for the @xmath235 magnitude bin and the @xmath236 color bin ,",
    "the redshift probability distribution function , @xmath237 , is defined as :      where @xmath239 is defined as any galaxy in that bin with a secure spectroscopic redshift within the range of the supercluster , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 is defined as any object in that bin with a secure redshift outside this range .",
    "this probability was calculated in each bin over the color range @xmath242 and a magnitude range of @xmath243 .",
    "the number of supercluster members missed by our spectroscopy is then :      where @xmath245 is the number of photometrically detected objects within that color@xmath7magnitude bin that were not targeted for spectroscopy and @xmath246 is the number of low quality spectra in that bin for which the redshift was uncertain . for almost all of the 42 color@xmath7magnitude bins defined in this manner we have obtained spectral information on some non - zero fraction of the photometric objects in that bin . for those color@xmath7magnitude bins",
    "that are highly populated with cl1604 members ( i.e. , @xmath247 , @xmath248 ) the fraction of photometrically detected objects for which we have spectral information is quite high , ranging from @xmath1730% to greater than 80% .    for each cl1604 group and cluster ,",
    "the effect of this incompleteness on ew ( [ ] ) , ew(h@xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 values measured from our composite spectra is estimated in the following way .",
    "for all color@xmath7magnitude bins in which @xmath249 , the spectra of @xmath250 galaxies were randomly drawn from the observed supercluster members in that color@xmath7magnitude bin .",
    "these randomly drawn galaxies are included in a new  completeness - corrected \" composite spectrum along with the original members of that particular system such that the number of galaxies in the new composite spectrum is :      for each structure the completeness - corrected composite spectrum is generated 500 times and the ew ( [ ] ) , ew(h@xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 are measured for each realization . while the number of randomly drawn supercluster members used to make the completeness correction remains constant in each realization for a particular structure , the galaxies used to make the completeness correction change for each realization .",
    "for each structure , a distribution of ew ( [ ] ) , ew(h@xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 values is generated from the 500 realizations of the completeness corrected composite spectrum .",
    "the  incompleteness error \" is calculated from the second moment of this distribution for each structure and is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "this error is added in quadrature to the random errors on the ews and the @xmath85 measurements in cases where the full cl1604 galaxy sample is used ( i.e. , not subsets of brighter galaxies , as in  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "in addition to performing this analysis for each of the eight groups and clusters of the supercluster , an identical analysis was performed on a composite spectrum which included members of all five of the cl1604 group systems ( the  groups \" sample ) .",
    "the galaxies included when estimating the effects of completeness are drawn not only from the denser regions of the supercluster ( i.e. , @xmath252 from a group or cluster center ) but from all environments .",
    "in such a way we attempt to simulate the _ maximum possible variance _ of the spectral quantities measured from the composite spectra due to incompleteness . by using such a method",
    "we are inherently assuming that the spectral properties of observed supercluster members in any given color@xmath7magnitude bin are similar to those supercluster galaxies for which we do not have spectral information . if the spectroscopically undetected supercluster members have significantly different spectra , this method loses its effectiveness .",
    "however , in any given color@xmath7magnitude bin we observe significant variance of the spectral properties of confirmed member galaxies , which gives us confidence that this method is a reasonable approximation of the true error due to our incomplete spectral sampling ."
