    "colloidal suspensions are interesting experimental realizations of many - particle systems because , in contrast to molecules , they are directly accessible to observations and the interactions can be tuned in a wide range by means of the preparation procedure and the experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of colloidal suspensions , however , implies many system parameters to be specified , such as size and shape of the colloids as well as strength and functional form of the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "in addition , the number of parameters increases enormously if one considers mixtures of different colloidal species instead of a pure system of only one type of colloid .",
    "moreover , the dimension of the phase diagram increases in parallel with the number of colloidal species in the suspension .",
    "the high dimensionality of the parameter space and the phase diagrams call for a simple theory to get an overview of the global phase behavior of colloidal suspensions because a systematic scan by means of experiments or computer simulations is precluded .    in the present work",
    "such a simple theory is formulated for the case of binary mixtures of spherical colloids of the same radius and opposite charges of equal magnitude .",
    "the global phase diagrams for this setting are in terms of the temperature , the pressure , and the composition and there is only one additional parameter describing the screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the reason to consider this comparatively low - dimensional problem here is that the reliability of the approach should be assessed with respect to available results on special cases obtained by means of computer simulations @xcite and madelung sum calculations @xcite .",
    "an extension of the method to multi - component , size- and charge - polydisperse colloidal suspensions is readily achieved along the same lines .",
    "the proposed mean - field - like formalism correctly interpolates between the hard - sphere limit at high temperatures and a madelung - type description at low temperatures . as a mean - field theory",
    ", the present approach underestimates fluctuations such that critical phenomena and quantitative aspects of phase transitions are covered in lowest order only .",
    "the over - all topology of the phase diagram , in particular the types of phases present , however , is not expected to be influenced qualitatively .",
    "the simple and transparent formalism turns out to be in semi - quantitative agreement with the computer simulation results of ref .",

    "the expressions involve a priori unknown constants which are fixed by fitting to the well - known hard - sphere fluid - crystal transition .",

    "the reliability of the method has been checked by comparison with computer simulation results @xcite for one single composition and screening strength as well as with madelung sum calculations @xcite in the low - temperature limit",
    ". limitations of the present formalism can be understood as a result of the absence of fluctuations within mean - field theories and properties of the mean - spherical approximation ( msa ) .",
    "the influence of the screening strength on the stability of crystalline phases has been discussed , which has implications , e.g. , on the preparation procedure and the choice of experimental conditions .",
    "an extension of the presented theory to multi - component , size- and charge - polydisperse colloidal suspensions along the lines described in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] is straightforward as the free volume equation of state used for the solid phases does not explicitly depend on the colloid radii and more general formulations of the msa are available @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a matter of choosing an appropriate set of candidate solid structures ( see tab .",
