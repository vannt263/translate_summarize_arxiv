    "the ability to create large clouds of metastable ( @xmath0 ) h atoms in a magnetic trap makes it possible to study the rich collisional physics of cold metastable h. in an encounter between two metastables , the possible outcomes include penning ionization , the formation of molecular ions , excitation transfer to short - lived @xmath11 states , and hyperfine transitions @xcite . if the @xmath0 atoms are generated from a background @xmath8 gas , then several @xmath8-@xmath0 collision processes may also occur .",
    "though these states of h are among the simplest atomic states in nature , an accurate description of their inelastic collisions at low energies remains a theoretical challenge @xcite .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the rate of quenching collisions between metastables is small enough to allow dense ( @xmath12  @xmath3 ) @xmath0 clouds to exist for tens of milliseconds , which is an appreciable fraction of the 122  ms natural lifetime of the @xmath0 state .",
    "such a cloud can serve as an atom source for precision spectroscopy of transitions originating in the @xmath0 state .",
    "in particular , the absolute frequencies of transitions from the @xmath0 to higher - lying states can be combined with the well - known @xmath8-@xmath0 interval to simultaneously determine the @xmath8 lamb shift ( a sensitive test of qed ) and the rydberg constant ( which relates several more fundamental constants ) @xcite .",

    "we have been able to generate metastable h clouds which are larger and longer - lived than in our previous work @xcite . in this paper , we report results from decay studies of trapped @xmath0 clouds , conducted at temperatures ranging from a few mk to below 100  @xmath4k .",
    "these results include the first experimental determinations of the @xmath0-@xmath0 two - body loss rate constant @xmath14 and upper limits for the @xmath8-@xmath0 inelastic rate constant @xmath10 . in the case of @xmath14 , we have observed a temperature dependence below 230  @xmath4k which is not predicted in the current theory for cold metastable h collisions @xcite .",

    ", the detection efficiency can be inferred from the total number of signal photons counted and the initial number of atoms @xcite . the corrections account for other loss mechanisms , for the branching ratio back to the trapped ground state , and for reabsorption ( `` radiation trapping '' ) of the lyman-@xmath13 photons by the ground state cloud .",
    "the photons emitted by the quenched metastables have a frequency which is detuned from a 100  mhz - wide @xmath8-@xmath11 absorption resonance by only 1.1  ghz , and at the densities achieved in our experiments , the effects of radiation trapping are significant . using monte carlo simulations of lyman-@xmath13 propagation in experimentally realistic cloud geometries , it was determined that typically @xmath30% of potential signal photons are absorbed and scattered in the atom cloud @xcite .",
    "other factors , such as the small detection solid angle ( @xmath31  sr ) , the transmission of two mgf@xmath32 windows between the atoms and the mcp , and the mcp quantum efficiency , lead to the small overall detection efficiency .    based on the detection efficiency , we can estimate @xmath33 , the population of the metastable cloud , and @xmath34 , the peak metastable density in the trap . in a very cold sample ( 87  @xmath4k ) , as many as 150 lyman-@xmath13 photons",

    "the background , which is typically small compared to the metastable signal , decays in a few milliseconds to a negligible level . to establish a background correction for our decay data ,",
    "the laser is tuned far off resonance at the end of each trapping sequence .",
    "the background fluorescence is then recorded for the same cycle of wait times used when generating metastables .    in earlier experiments , performed in an entirely nonmetallic cell",
    ", we found that stray electric fields limited metastable lifetimes to 1  ms or less . in the current version of the apparatus , a copper film has been added to the inside surface of the trapping cell .",
    "the film is thin enough to allow rf to penetrate the trapping cell from outside coils , yet thick enough to significantly suppress stray dc fields . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ efield](a ) , the copper film has been divided into several contiguous electrodes which are used to apply both the quench pulses and a compensating dc field .",
    "the dc voltage which best compensates for stray fields is found by measuring the metastable decay rate in a low density sample for several applied voltages . as shown in fig .",
    "[ efield](b ) , we observe the expected quadratic dependence of the decay rate on electric field . with optimal stray field compensation , metastable lifetimes as long as 100  ms have been observed , approaching the natural lifetime of the @xmath0 state .",
    "our decay measurements have focused on metastable clouds generated in four magnetic trap configurations , spanning a range of temperatures and ground state densities .",
    "these trap configurations are designated traps w , x , y , and z , and each has its own standard evaporation sequence for sample preparation . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , decay measurements were repeated in each trap over several consecutive trap cycles .",

    "x , y , and z is estimated to be 10% .",
    "our investigation of inelastic @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions was initiated by observations of how the decay behavior depended on metastable density . in each of the standard",
    "traps the @xmath0 density was varied by generating metastables at different laser detunings and also by exciting different @xmath8 densities as the ground state sample decayed .",
    "the decay curves were binned according to the total number of metastable signal counts in each decay curve . since , to a first approximation",
    ", the signal is proportional to the metastable density , this means that decay curves corresponding to approximately the same initial @xmath0 density were averaged together . for a preliminary analysis ,",
    "the average decay curves were fit to a simple exponential function , with only the decay rate and initial amplitude as free parameters .",
    "figure  [ decayrateswxyz ] shows the results of this analysis . in the two coldest traps , w and x",
    ", the decay rate clearly increases with increasing metastable density , consistent with the presence of two - body inelastic loss processes .",
    "furthermore , among the four traps , the decay rate is largest in trap w , where the highest metastable densities are achieved .",
    "the peak @xmath0 densities achieved in each trap can be estimated from the number of signal counts observed , but the uncertainty is large , reflecting significant uncertainties in both the metastable cloud shape and the detection efficiency .",
    "the shape of the @xmath0 cloud depends sensitively on the location of the laser beam waists with respect to the magnetic trap . for the density values listed in fig .",
    "[ decayrateswxyz ] , a detection efficiency of @xmath29 was assumed , and the counterpropagating laser beams were assumed to be perfectly overlapped and well - aligned with the atom cloud ; with a plausible misalignment , the actual densities could be a factor of 3 smaller .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ decaycurves ] , a comparison of the average decay curves at high and low metastable signal provides further evidence for two - body loss at high densities . at low @xmath0 densities ,",
    "the decay curves are well described by an exponential decay . by contrast , the decay curves at high @xmath0 densities deviate significantly from a simple exponential .",
    "they are better fit by a `` one - plus - two '' model with a free two - body decay parameter and a one - body decay rate fixed at its low density value .",
    "the one - plus - two model is described further in sec .",
    "[ sec : determination ] .    in principle , three - body inelastic collisions could also contribute to the observed density dependence of the decay .",
    "however , the three - body loss rate constant for metastables would have to be unexpectedly large to play a significant role at our experimental densities ( @xmath39  @xmath3 ) @xcite . in the following analysis",
    ", we assume that two - body effects dominate .",
    "in this section , we derive the rate constant @xmath14 for two - body loss of metastables based on decay data of the form @xmath40 , the number of signal counts observed when quenching at wait time @xmath41 .",
    "the constant is defined as follows to give the rate of change of the local @xmath0 density @xmath42 due to two - body processes : @xmath43 if the relative distribution of metastables in the trap is not changing in time ( `` static approximation '' ) , @xmath14 is the product of the metastable detection efficiency , a factor describing the cloud geometry , and a two - body decay parameter extracted from fits to @xmath40 . after analyzing the decay process in the static approximation , we introduce dynamic corrections to obtain final results for @xmath14 .",
    "given the geometry of our apparatus and the ground state densities achieved , it is a reasonable first approximation to assume that the metastable cloud does not change shape as it decays .",
    "the initial extent of the metastable cloud along the trap axis , about 2  cm between the @xmath44 points , is defined by the depth of focus of the laser .",
    "this is shorter than the thermal length of the ground state cloud , which ranges from 4  cm in trap w to 23  cm in trap z. on the time scale of the decay , the @xmath0 atoms collide frequently with @xmath8 atoms . at the peak ground state density in trap w ,",
    "for example , the @xmath0 mean free path is 100  @xmath4 m , and the mean time between collisions is 70  @xmath4s .",
    "( to calculate these values , we use the theoretical value for @xmath45 , the elastic @xmath8-@xmath0 scattering length @xcite . )",
    "thus , the metastables diffuse slowly along the trap axis .",
    "numerical simulations of the time evolution of the @xmath0 cloud have shown that over a cloud lifetime of 100  ms , the shape of the initial axial distribution does not change dramatically @xcite . in the radial direction",
    ", the cloud shape evolves even less , although for a different reason . due to the geometry of the magnetic trap ,",
    "the metastable cloud is cylindrically symmetric and confined to the same thermal radius as the ground state cloud .",
    "this thermal radius , about 110  @xmath4 m for trap w , is comparable to the @xmath0 mean free path . in a time shorter than the 2  ms excitation pulse , the metastables establish an equilibrium spatial distribution across the short radial dimension .",
    "the relative spatial distribution of metastables is quasi - static , then , because ( 1 ) axial diffusion through the @xmath8 gas is slow and ( 2 ) radial equilibrium exists over the lifetime of the @xmath0 cloud .    in the static approximation",
