    "a new class of one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnetic compounds with the general formula a@xmath0xyo@xmath1 ( a = sr , ca ; x , y = transition metals ) has attracted particular interest recently .",
    "@xcite these materials crystallize in a k@xmath4cdcl@xmath1-type rhombohedral structure , which consists of infinite chains built up of alternating face - sharing yo@xmath1 octahedra and xo@xmath1 trigonal prisms . these yo@xmath1-xo@xmath1 chains",
    "are separated from each other by a@xmath5 cations and constitute a hexagonal cross - sectional arrangement perpendicular to the chain direction .",
    "depending upon the nature and the oxidization states of the cations at the x and the y sites , these materials present a range of low dimensional magnetic phenomena .",
    "@xcite in this class of materials , sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 is reported to be a spin half heisenberg antiferromagnet ( afm ) chain compound .",
    "@xcite    from a crystallographic point of view , sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 does not constitute an ideal linear spin chain structure  @xcite .",
    "firstly , due to the presence of cu@xmath5 cations at the x site , the k@xmath4cdcl@xmath1-type rhombohedral structure undergoes a monoclinic distortion .",
    "the pt@xmath6 ions stay at the center of the pto@xmath1 octahedra maintaining a linear structure , whereas the cu@xmath5 ions move from the center of the cuo@xmath1 trigonal prisms to their faces .",
    "successive cu@xmath5 ions on a chain are displaced away from the chain axis in opposite directions , resulting in a zigzag chain structure with a cu - cu bond angle of 160.94@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "secondly , along each chain , neighboring @xmath2 cu@xmath5 ions are separated by a pt@xmath6 ion . in the presence of a strong octahedral crystal field ,",
    "the pt@xmath6 ions adopt a low spin ground state with zero effective spin .",
    "this results in a @xmath80@xmath80@xmath9 ..... type of spin chain structure in which the @xmath2 inter - spin separations parallel and perpendicular to the chains are almost equal .",
    "prompted by this fact , claridge _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the magnetic susceptibility data of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 considering both intra - chain ( @xmath10 ) and inter - chain ( @xmath11 ) couplings among the cu@xmath5 ions . from their analysis , using a modified bonner and fisher model  @xcite , they reported that @xmath10 = 24.7 k and @xmath11 = 7.3 k. since @xmath10/@xmath11 @xmath3 3 , they concluded that the compound should not be considered as a 1d magnetic system .",
    "however , the broad maximum observed in the magnetic susceptibility data  @xcite gives a strong indication that the compound does indeed have the characteristics of a low - dimensional magnetic system . as a result",
    ", the magnetic status of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 remains unclear .    in this paper , we present the results of a thorough investigation of the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity behavior of single crystal samples of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 .",
    "while there have been studies of the magnetic susceptibility of this compound  @xcite , the present paper reports the first investigation of the heat capacity of this material .",
    "despite the fact that heat capacity can provide important information about the magnetic character of spin chain systems , very little heat capacity data have been published to date for the a@xmath0xyo@xmath1 class of compounds  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model of bonner and fisher has been successfully used in the past to fit the experimental susceptibility data for @xmath2 spin chain systems  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the extrapolation of numerical calculations for a finite number of spins ( @xmath12 11 ) and is valid in a limited temperature range ( @xmath13 , where @xmath10 is the intra - chain coupling constant in kelvin ) .",
    "recently klmper , johnston , and co - workers  @xcite have used the bethe anstatz approach to formulate a model for the @xmath2 heisenberg spin chain system , which should be valid over the entire temperature range .",
    "this model is an extension of previous theoretical work  @xcite . in the present paper , the majority of the fitting has been carried out using this new analytical model proposed by johnston and co - workers ( hereafter called the johnston model )  @xcite . the bonner - fisher model has also been used for comparison . throughout the paper ,",
    "we have adopted the convention where the spin hamiltonian , @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath14 = @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-th spin on the chain and @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the needle shaped crystals of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 used in this investigation were prepared by a k@xmath19co@xmath0 flux method as described in reference  @xcite .",
    "the crystals were analyzed by x - ray diffraction using mo @xmath20 radiation on a bruker nonius kappa ccd single crystal x - ray diffractometer .",
    "the cell refinement showed that the crystals have a monoclinic structure ( space group c2/c ) with lattice parameters @xmath21 = 9.34(1 )  , @xmath22 = 9.64(1 )  , @xmath23 = 6.68(1 )    and @xmath24 = 91.91(5)@xmath25 , which are in good agreement with the literature  @xcite .",
    "the rod axis of the crystals was found to be along the [ 201 ] direction , which coincides with the cuo@xmath1-pto@xmath1 chain direction .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a quantum design squid magnetometer in the temperature ( @xmath26 ) range 2 - 400 k with the applied magnetic field ( @xmath27 ) parallel to the chain direction . the zero field heat capacity ( @xmath28 )",
    "measurements were performed by a relaxation method using a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the @xmath28 versus @xmath26 data in the temperature range 1.9 to 300 k were recorded with a conventional @xmath29he insert , whereas , the data collected below 1.9 k were recorded using a @xmath30he refrigerator option .",
    "since the mass of each crystal is typically @xmath3 1 - 2 mg , an assembly of 6 crystals , with their rod axis aligned , were used for both the magnetization ( @xmath31 ) and the heat capacity measurements .    in order to obtain information about the short range magnetic correlations from the heat capacity data ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate the lattice contribution to the heat capacity ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is therefore , important to measure a non - magnetic reference compound with the same crystal structure and containing elements with similar masses .",
    "for this purpose , a ceramic sample of the isostructural compound sr@xmath0znpto@xmath1 was prepared by the usual solid state reaction technique  @xcite .",
    "this compound was found to be essentially nonmagnetic .",
    "the small curie constant @xmath33 emu / k - mol , derived from the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature data for sr@xmath0znpto@xmath1 , corresponds to only 0.1% of the pt@xmath34 ions on the prismatic sites being in the high - spin ( @xmath35 = 2 ) magnetic state .",
    "figure 2 shows the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath36 ) versus temperature data of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 in the temperature range 2 - 400 k with the applied magnetic field ( 10 koe ) along the [ 201 ] direction .",
    "the low temperature @xmath37 data show a rise with decreasing temperature below 10 k , similar to that observed in a previous investigation  @xcite on this compound .",
    "such a feature has also been observed in a number of other spin chain compounds  @xcite and it is generally thought to arise from the presence of broken chains and/or paramagnetic impurities ; both effects lead to a curie like term .",
    "@xcite at intermediate temperatures , the susceptibility versus temperature data shows a broad peak around 32 k , which is typical of short range magnetic order in a spin chain system .",
    "the high temperature data ( 250 - 400 k ) shows curie - weiss behavior along with a temperature independent positive term @xmath38 .    for a quantitative analysis of the susceptibility versus temperature data ,",
    "we express @xmath39 as a sum of three terms as in reference  @xcite with @xmath40    the term @xmath41 = @xmath42 is a curie - like term coming from broken chains or paramagnetic impurities in the system .",
    "the term @xmath38 is a combination of the van vleck paramagnetic term and the diamagnetic contributions from the atomic cores .",
    "@xmath43 is the contribution coming from the 1d magnetic correlations among the spins .",
    "this can be approximated using the johnston model ( equation ( 50 ) of reference  @xcite ) for the @xmath2 uniform linear chain system where we write @xmath44 = @xmath45 where @xmath10 and @xmath46 ( land @xmath46 factor ) are the free parameters . with these considerations ,",
    "we have fitted our @xmath37 data to equation  [ chiterms ]  in the temperature range 2 - 400 k ( solid line in figure 2 ) .",
    "the good quality of the fit over the full temperature range indicates that the johnston model can be used to describe the susceptibility behavior of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 .",
    "the parameters obtained from the fitting are : @xmath10 = 25.7(1 ) k , @xmath46 = 2.050(3 ) , @xmath38 = 8.1 ( 7)@xmath4710@xmath48 emu / mol , @xmath49 = 0.0055(1 ) emu - k / mol and @xmath50 = -0.14 ( 5 ) k. similar fitting for @xmath51 13 k ( @xmath52 ) , using the bonner - fisher model for @xmath53 , produces a value of @xmath10 = 25.3(1 ) k , which compares well with the result obtained using the johnston model .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is also in good agreement with the value ( 26.1 k ) estimated by nguyen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using the bonner - fisher model .",
    "the curie constant associated with @xmath41 corresponds to a moment of 1.73 @xmath54 residing on @xmath3 1.5% of the cu atoms present in the sample .",
    "the value of @xmath41 remains practically unchanged if one sets @xmath50 = 0 . this concentration of free cu@xmath5 ions is comparable with the values previously reported in some other cu@xmath5 based spin chain compounds  @xcite .    at high temperatures ( 250 - 400 k ) , the 1/(@xmath55 ) versus @xmath26 plot ( see inset of the upper panel ) is found to be linear with the value of @xmath38 obtained from the global fitting ( 2 - 400 k ) of our data to equation  [ chiterms ] .",
    "this is expected , because at high temperatures , @xmath41 becomes negligible and @xmath53 reduces to a curie - weiss term .",
    "additional confidence in the reliability of this @xmath38 value comes from fitting the high temperature @xmath55 data to a simple curie - weiss expression , where one finds an effective moment @xmath56 = 1.77(2 ) @xmath54/cu@xmath5 , which is close to the theoretical value ( 1.73 @xmath54 ) , and a paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath57 = -26 ( @xmath58 2 ) k that compares well with the @xmath10 value as expected for an @xmath35 = @xmath8 spin chain system .",
    "the lower panel of figure 2 is an expanded view of the susceptibility data below 60 k , showing the total @xmath37 ( filled circles ) , the @xmath43 data ( open circles ) and a fit using the johnston formula ( solid line ) .",
    "it should be noted that even on this expanded scale , the overall agreement of the @xmath43 data to the johnston fitting is found to be good .",
    "however , below @xmath3 20 k a discrepancy between the experimental data and the fitted line appears .",
    "in fact , the change in the slope expected in the johnston model around @xmath59 0.4@xmath10 k ( about 10 k in the present case ) , is not present in our data .",
    "given the fact that sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 has an unconventional chain structure , some departures in the magnetic behavior from the theoretical model are not unexpected .",
    "nevertheless , it must also be borne in mind that in the temperature range considered here , the @xmath43 data is very sensitive to the subtraction of @xmath41 , which may introduce some uncertainty in the resulting @xmath43 values .    in order to better understand the low temperature behavior of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 ,",
    "it is useful to investigate the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of this system , which is expected to be much less affected by additional contributions from broken chains or paramagnetic impurities .",
    "the total heat capacity of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 as a function of temperature ( 1.9 - 300 k ) is shown in figure 3a ( inset ) .",
    "this data contains no signature of long range magnetic ordering in this temperature range .",
    "figure 3 also depicts the @xmath60 of the nonmagnetic isostructural compounds sr@xmath0znpto@xmath1 . at low temperatures ( below about 50 k ) , @xmath61(sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 ) is larger in value than @xmath61(sr@xmath0znpto@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is clearly due to an additional contribution to the heat capacity of magnetic origin for the cu compound .",
    "it is expected that the magnetic contribution to @xmath61(sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 ) should tend to zero at high temperatures .",
    "there is a difference between @xmath61(sr@xmath0znpto@xmath1 ) and @xmath61(sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 ) even at 300 k , which is due to the mass difference of the cu and the zn atoms . in order to calculate the lattice contribution , @xmath32 , of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 from the heat capacity data of sr@xmath0znpto@xmath1",
    ", a careful mass correction to the data is required . in the present case",
    "we have used a phenomenological scaling of the debye temperature ( @xmath62 ) with two scaling factors ( see appendix ) to obtain the @xmath32 from the heat capacity of the non - magnetic reference sample .",
    "it should be noted that the scaling for @xmath32 has only a weak effect at low temperatures .",
    "@xmath32(sr@xmath63cupto@xmath64 ) is almost superimposed onto @xmath61(sr@xmath63znpto@xmath64 ) below about 40 k. since this is the region of interest for the analysis of the 1d magnetic features , these should not be significantly affected by any imperfection in the model used to derive @xmath32(sr@xmath63cupto@xmath64 ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure 3 shows the magnetic contribution to the heat capacity of sr@xmath63cupto@xmath64 , @xmath65 , that was obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution @xmath66 from the total heat capacity @xmath67 . the main feature is a broad peak at low temperature , as expected in a 1d magnetic system  @xcite . in their theoretical investigation of @xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains ,",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed analytical expressions for the temperature dependence of the heat capacity .",
    "the solid line in figure 3 is the curve predicted by this model ( equations 54a - c of reference  @xcite ) for @xmath68 k. it is worth emphasizing that there are no free parameters other than @xmath10 in this model . on the scale of figure 3 ,",
    "only curves obtained using a narrow range ( @xmath58 0.5 k ) of @xmath10 values around 25.5 k provide good overall agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the curve corresponding to @xmath10 = 25.5 k gives the best fit for @xmath69 and the quality of the agreement is quite satisfactory up to about 40 k. above @xmath70 k , the @xmath65 data clearly departs from the model , a behavior which can be ascribed to the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath32 ( for instance , at @xmath59 60 k , the expected magnetic contribution is just 2% of the measured total heat capacity ) . in the bonner - fisher model",
    ", the intra - chain coupling is related to the temperature @xmath71 corresponding to the maximum in @xmath65 data as @xmath72 0.962@xmath10 . considering @xmath71 in the range 24 - 25.5 k ,",
    "one obtains @xmath10 value lying between 25 k and 26.5 k , which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath10 given by the johnston model above .",
    "the inset in the lower panel of figure 3 displays the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy derived by @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite one observes that the calculated entropy saturates slightly below the theoretical value , @xmath74 = 5.76 j / mol - k , expected for @xmath35 = 1/2 . this apparent _ missing _",

    "this may be a signature of three dimensional ( 3d ) long range magnetic ordering or of a spin - peierls - like transition .",
    "however , the occurrence of such a transition appears to be in contrast with the work of irons _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who reported the absence of any anomaly in the a.c .",
    "susceptibility measurements down to 0.27 k on a polycrystalline sample of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 . in order to understand the significance of this feature ,",
    "further investigations based on neutron scattering measurements are required . for the present analysis",
    ", we decided to restrict ourselves to the temperature range @xmath77 2 k , for which @xmath76 is presumably related to the short range intra - chain coupling only .    in case of an afm spin chain system like sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 , @xmath76 is expected to show a linear @xmath78 dependence , @xmath79 , at low temperatures ( approximately , @xmath80 which is below 5 k in our case ) . our @xmath65 data in figure 4 ( inset ) shows a quasi - linear behavior in the temperature range 2 - 6 k , but clearly extrapolates to a finite @xmath26 intercept of about 0.5 k at @xmath76 = 0 .",
    "such a behavior suggests the possibility of a small gap of @xmath81 0.5 k in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "although , a spin gap should not exist in case of a uniform @xmath2 spin chain system , the possibility of a gap can not be ruled out in the case of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 , with its unconventional spin chain structure .    in figure 4 , we have shown @xmath75 behavior predicted by the johnston model ( down to @xmath26 = 1 k ) with @xmath10 = 25.5 k along with the experimental data .",
    "while the johnston model well represents the experimental data down to 5 k , a deviation is visible in the low temperature data .",
    "the experimental @xmath75 contains a clear downward curvature below 5 k , which is absent in the johnston model that shows a rather constant @xmath82 behavior consistent with the expected linear @xmath26 dependence of the @xmath76 data in this temperature range ( 1 - 5 k ) .",
    "this departure from the johnston model behavior around 5 k can not be simply attributed to the small feature observed around 1.5 k. if a spin gap is responsible for such a departure , to a first approximation , it can be accounted by a phenomenological relation @xmath83 at low temperatures .",
    "the dotted line in figure 4 shows the fitting of @xmath84 to the data in the temperature range 2 - 5 k along with an extrapolation slightly below and above 2 k and 5 k respectively .",
    "the parameters estimated by the fitting are found to be @xmath85 = 0.128 jk@xmath86mol@xmath87 and @xmath88 = 0.64 k. this phenomenological spin gap model can account for the downward curvature in the @xmath82 data below 5 k. according to the johnston model , for a @xmath2 afm spin chain , the coefficient of the linear term ( @xmath89 ) in @xmath76 is related to the intra - chain coupling parameter as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the universal gas constant .",
    "although , strictly speaking , this relation is valid for an ideal gap - less spin chain system , we have used the relation in the present context to estimate the value of @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 , obtained by inserting the value of @xmath85 in the above relation , is found to be 22.2 @xmath58 0.5 k , which is close to the values of @xmath10 obtained from other methods .",
    "the present magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity investigations on single crystals of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 show that there is a good overall agreement between our experimental data and the theoretical predictions for an @xmath35 = @xmath8 heisenberg afm spin chain system .",
    "the values of the characteristic coupling parameter @xmath10 , obtained from different measurements , are reasonably consistent .",
    "such good agreement with standard spin chain models is rather surprising for a compound whose one - dimensional magnetic character was recently questioned  @xcite .",
    "the doubts raised were based upon the large value of the inter - chain coupling parameter ( @xmath11 ) , derived from an analysis of the magnetic susceptibility , leading to a ratio @xmath92 3 .",
    "our susceptibility analysis discussed so far in the text has been performed without considering any inter - chain coupling parameter ( i.e. , @xmath11 = 0 ) . in order to get an idea of the inter - chain coupling parameter",
    ", we have reanalyzed our susceptibility data with the relation proposed by hatfield  @xcite and previously used by claridge _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we found that this mean field approach can improve the quality of the fitting with the addition of an afm inter - chain coupling parameter .",

    "_ et al . _",

    ", such a large value of @xmath11 appears to be inconsistent with the global magnetic behavior , particularly the absence of long range magnetic order down to 2 k. a finite value of the inter - chain coupling should eventually lead to a three dimensional ordering at a temperature @xmath93 and theoretical models have established relationships between @xmath93 and the coupling parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) for the weakly coupled linear chain systems . for @xmath35 = @xmath8 afm heisenberg chains , the model proposed by oguchi  @xcite , based on a green s function method , has been used extensively  @xcite .",
    "recently , schulz  @xcite has proposed another model relating @xmath93 , @xmath10 and j@xmath94 for weakly coupled @xmath35 = @xmath8 chains , which is based on a mean - field approximation for the inter - chain coupling and exact results for the resulting effective 1d problem .",
    "both these models deal with a square lattice of the spin chains and as outlined by lines _",

    "one obtains the _ lower boundary _ of the ratio of the intra - chain and inter - chain coupling parameters to be approximately 130 ( @xmath97 130 ) and this ratio is more consistent with the 1d magnetic character of sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 .",
    "now the question is how to reconcile such a large @xmath98 ratio with the fact that the distance between two neighboring cu@xmath5 ions is approximately the same along and perpendicular to the chain .",
    "it is well known that the strength of the exchange coupling not only depends upon the distance , but also on the nature of the exchange pathway . from the viewpoint of the mediation of the exchange interaction between cu@xmath5 ions , the situation is very different parallel and perpendicular to the chains .",
    "although the pt@xmath6 ions located in between the cu@xmath5 ions along the chains are in the low spin state ( @xmath35 = 0 ) , they possess unfilled 3@xmath99 orbitals and can thus participate in the exchange interaction .",
    "a similar mechanism can not be expected for the sr@xmath5 ions located in between the cuo@xmath1-pto@xmath1 chains .",
    "such a difference in the exchange pathway can qualitatively explain the large @xmath98 ratio in sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 .",
    "finally , let us consider the low temperature ( 0.35 - 6 k ) heat capacity data for sr@xmath0cupto@xmath1 , which revealed some deviation from the @xmath2 1d afm heisenberg model . although , they are also visible in @xmath43 data ( figure 3 ) , such deviations can be studied more precisely in @xmath76 data",
    ". the latter data led us to propose the existence of a small energy gap in the spin excitation spectra .",
    "a uniform half - odd integral spin chain system is supposed to be gapless  @xcite .",
    "one simple explanation for the origin of a small gap is a weak modulation in the strength of the exchange interaction along the chain  @xcite .",
