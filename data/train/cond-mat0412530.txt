    "this has been interpreted @xcite as an indication of certain fraction of fe not contributing to the ferromagnetic long range order ( lro ) .",
    "these authors have also performed mossbauer experiments in order to ascertain the oxidation states of fe in the host semiconductor znga@xmath0o@xmath1 . for a @xmath11 doped sample they observed the presence of only fe@xmath12 states with some of them displaying a paramagnetic signal ( doublet ) and the rest showing magnetically ordered fe@xmath12 .",
    "we note at this point that in the context of fe@xmath7o@xmath1 , it has already been argued that above the verwey transition @xcite an fe@xmath2 cation can be viewed as an fe@xmath12 ion plus a delocalized electron .",

    "hence the system is not likely to be a candidate for description in terms of a kondo impurity model @xcite .",
    "it is rather much more reasonable to assume that the electrons hop between doped sites via mainly the oxygen orbitals in the same way as in the double exchange mechanism in the manganites @xcite .",
    "we would like to note here that in the case of manganites each mn ion is surrounded by oxygen atoms in an octahedral environment and these octahedra are corner shared .",
    "the double exchange mechanism then operates through a path of the type mn - o - mn giving rise to a ferromagnetic order among the mn spins . in the present system",
    "we observe that for the doping considered in our band structure calculation there exist paths of the type fe - o@xmath20-o@xmath20-fe where o@xmath20 is one of the two nonequivalent oxygens which surrounds fe in a tetrahedral environment as described in the previous section .",
    "this assumption of electron transport via oxygen orbitals is supported by our band structure calculations where we see that there exists a small but finite hybridization between the doped fe and o@xmath20 at the fermi level ( see fig . [ figure1](a ) ) .",
    "note that the contribution of zn , ga and o@xmath0 is negligible at the fermi level and hence are very unlikely to take part in the electronic transport .",

    "we would like to emphasize though that the fe doped znga@xmath0o@xmath4that we are considering here is not strictly a dms as the doping level is quite high .",
    "let us consider first the case where all the doped fe are in tetrahedral positions . in fig .",
    "2 we draw a schematic energy level diagram of fe 3@xmath24 orbitals together with the valence and conduction band of the host semiconductor .",
    "we discuss in the following three limits of the problem , ( i ) all or most of the fe are fe@xmath12 , ( ii ) fe is in both fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath12 oxidation states and ( iii ) the limit of high fe@xmath2 concentration .",
    "in the situation when neighbouring doped tetrahedral sites are all fe@xmath12 , there are 5 electrons of the same spin in each site due to hund s rule .",
    "if the spins at these neighbouring doped sites are ferromagnetically aligned then hopping of an electron between sites is blocked by the pauli principle . if instead , they are antiferromagnetically aligned the system gains superexchange energy by a virtual process of electron transfer between the fe ions .",

    "if the 5 electrons in fe@xmath2 ( all aligned ) are in an antiferromagnetic configuration with the spins of the neighbouring fe@xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) ) , then an electron in fe@xmath2 has to pay an amount of energy equal to the hund s coupling ( @xmath28 ) in order to hop from one fe@xmath2 site to a neighbouring fe@xmath12 site . in the limit of large @xmath28",
    "this is practically forbidden and the system will try to gain the superexchange energy , approximately @xmath27 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the appropriate hopping integral between the relevant orbitals @xcite . on the contrary , in a ferromagnetic arrangement(fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) ) , the minority spin electron in fe@xmath2 can move to a neighbouring fe@xmath12 site without paying extra energy and the system gains kinetic energy ( ke ) in this process . from the above discussion",
    ", it is evident that when @xmath28 is large , the system will prefer to be in the ferromagnetic state rather than the antiferromagnetic one . if @xmath28 is moderate then all these energy scales are comparable and the competition between kinetic energy , superexchange energy ( se ) and @xmath28 will decide the phase boundaries .",
    "it is useful to make a note at this point that the fe@xmath2 ion with 3 electrons in its @xmath3 orbitals is likely to be jahn - teller ( jt ) active , i.e. the doubly - occupied orbital stabilizes over the singly occupied one , whereas fe@xmath12 with two electrons in the two @xmath3 orbitals is not jt active . in this case",
    "one can then work with only one @xmath3 orbital for fe@xmath2 ( the jahn - teller stabilized one ) with electrons hopping through this orbital .",
    "the mechanism of magnetic exchange due to electron delocalization goes through without loss of generality as outlined above ( with possible reduction in the overall @xmath3 bandwidth , which can be scaled away ) .",
    "the third @xmath3 electron in the fe@xmath31 site and the corresponding @xmath3 orbital can be ignored .",
    "but as we will see in the following , this single orbital model is not sufficient to describe the case where all ( or most of the ) doped fe are in a fe@xmath2 state .",
    "one has then to take into account both @xmath3 orbitals and the hopping among them .",
    "here we consider two neighbouring tetrahedral fe ions , both in fe@xmath2 configuration .",
    "since each of them have 3 electrons in their @xmath3 orbitals , one @xmath3 orbital is full and the other has one electron .",
    "therefore the only way electrons can hop is via this half - filled orbital . in this case",
    ", there are several possibilities arising from the relative values of the jt stabilization energy ( @xmath32 ) and the bandwidth ( @xmath33 ) of the e@xmath23 bands ( @xmath34 for the system under consideration ) .",
    "consider the situation when @xmath35 . in this case",
    "ferromagnetism is inhibited if the hopping matrix is diagonal .",
    "if , however , there exists off - diagonal hopping @xmath36 ( which , in general , depends on the orbitals involved and the symmetry of the lattice ) , then ferromagnetism could stabilize via a virtual hopping with a gain of ferromagnetic exchange energy @xmath37 .",

    "the fm state is stabilized by the ke of the e@xmath23 electrons since the superexchange energies are less than the ke .",
    "the underlying ground state , though , will be different when only diagonal hopping is allowed . in this case , in order to gain the ke , the fe@xmath2 ions will remain in a cooperative , staggered jt distorted arrangement which costs additional energy which depends on @xmath32 and may not be stable if afm superexchange energy is larger @xcite .    .",

    "[ figure4 ] we show the situation arising in the case @xmath40 with the @xmath3 orbitals in a cubic environment and nonzero overlap among them .",
    "one electron ( either up or down ) from the doubly occupied @xmath3 orbital of fe@xmath2 on one site can always move to the singly occupied @xmath3 orbital on the next fe@xmath2 site . in case of antiferromagnetic alignment ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4](a ) ) , the hopping of an electron from one fe@xmath2 site to the next costs @xmath28 amount of energy .",
    "the superexchange mechanism through virtual hopping is the only energy gain . in the ferromagnetic state ( fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) ) , however , the initial and final states are degenerate and the system gains kinetic energy due to resonance .",
    "it is also evident that the physics for large fe@xmath2 concentration is different from the low fe@xmath2 concentration limit . in the low concentration limit",
    ", an effective single orbital model captures the physical situation well , while in the high concentration limit , two bands are crucial for its understanding .",
    "this situation is somewhat reminiscent of the manganites where in the electron - doped side ( hole concentration @xmath41 0.5 ) the two @xmath3 orbitals and the hopping between them play a crucial role in determining@xcite the competition between the different magnetic phases whereas in the hole - dope side ( x @xmath42 0.5 ) , a model with only the jahn - teller stabilized single orbital is adequate .",
    "based on the above discussion we write down the following effective hamiltonian for fe - doped znga@xmath0o@xmath4 assuming a cubic environment    @xmath43    here we treat the t@xmath22 electrons as localized and @xmath3 as itinerant because the density of states ( fig .",
    "1 ) clearly shows that the @xmath3 down band is at the fermi level , whereas the fully filled @xmath26 up band is well below .",

    "we have not considered this geometrical frustration in the present calculation because the experimentally observed ratio of fe to ga is fairly small ( 1:6 ) .",
    "the fe atoms are assumed to be arranged in a cubic environment for the present calculation and hence there is no frustration .    in the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "[ h0 ] the orbital indices @xmath97 and",
    "@xmath98 now take the values 1,2 and 3 which represent @xmath99,@xmath100 and @xmath101 orbitals respectively .",
    "this hamiltonian will reduce in * k*-space to the form of eq .",
    "[ h1 ] as in the case of tetrahedral doping except from the fact that now @xmath102 is a 3x3 matrix with the elements given by @xmath103    here @xmath104 is the magnitude of the hopping integral between the neighbouring @xmath68-bonded @xmath99 orbitals in the x , y direction .",
    "note that the inter - orbital overlaps turn out to be zero in this case @xcite .",
    "following similar procedures outlined in the tetrahedral case we calculate the ground state magnetic phase diagram and observe that ( as shown below ) the ferromagnetic phase is stable in a wide range of parameter space in this case as well . however , we have not considered the coulomb interactions ( @xmath48 in eq . [ h0 ] ) in the present calculation of the phase diagram .    ) for fe in an octahedral environment in the @xmath105 plane with @xmath106 . in the inset",
    "we show the shift of the afm - fm phase boundary compared to that of the tetrahedral case ( x - axis is rescaled such that @xmath107 corresponds to all fe@xmath12 and @xmath108 to all fe@xmath2 in order to make a comparison ) , width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] we present the ground state phase diagram in the plane @xmath105 with a fixed value of @xmath106 .",
    "the three t@xmath22 orbitals have been taken as degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) and @xmath69 is the electron concentration in the @xmath26 levels ranging from @xmath109 ( corresponding to all fe@xmath12 ) to @xmath110 ( all fe@xmath2 , 4 electrons in @xmath26 ) . a comparison with the earlier phase diagram , for fe in a tetrahedral position ( fig .  [ figure5 ] ) , is shown in the inset .",
    "we observe a shift of the afm - fm phase boundary towards higher concentration of fe@xmath2 in the octahedral case .",
    "the absence of off - diagonal hopping among the t@xmath22 orbitals ( eq . [ eq5 ] ) reduces the effective ke gain in the double exchange mechanism .",
    "this , in turn , makes the fm phase less stable compared to the tetrahedral case .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase , therefore , stabilizes over a wider region in the phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless , we still observe a stable ferromagnetic phase in a moderate to high range of doping by fe@xmath2 ions .",
    "finite jt splitting of t@xmath22 orbitals may have interesting effects on the stability of the ferromagnetic phase in the high fe@xmath2 limit .",
    "since the inter - orbital hopping is zero , even a small but finite jt splitting may induce a cooperative staggered jt distorted order of the fe@xmath2 ions in the ferromagnetic phase to maximize the ke .",
    "this would make the ferromagnetic phase increasingly destabilized against the afm phase , depending on the value of @xmath32 , as well as against defects and other impurities present in the system@xcite .",
    "coulomb correlations , particularly the inter - orbital coulomb correlation ( @xmath50 ) , is expected to have a strong effect in stabilizing the afm phase in this case due to the reduced mobility of the carriers in the @xmath26 orbitals as argued above . following the arguments in sec .",
    "v , the afm phase at the right top corner in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] is expected to appear at a lower value of @xmath50 now .",
    "we observe from the above study of fe doped znga@xmath0o@xmath4that ferromagnetism could result from a delicate competition between double exchange , favouring the fm spin order , and superexchange , favouring afm order , when both fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath12 valence states are present .",
    "though the present experimental situation in this system does not make the limit of all fe@xmath2 in tetrahedral positions a very relevant one , there is nevertheless a rich underlying physics connected with the interplay between dominant jahn - teller , double exchange and superexchange interactions in this limit .",
    "finally , a special note is in order for the case where the doped fe ions go to both tetrahedral and octahedral environments replacing zn and ga ions respectively . in this mixed situation",
    ", it is necessary to first find out the extended and localized states from a careful density functional calculation .",
    "as the @xmath3-@xmath26 orbital overlap is negligible , it could be possible that in the mixed situation the double exchange mechanism would operate within the fe ions that belong entirely to one kind of crystalline environment ( i.e. , either in the tetrahedral or in the octahedral positions ) and hence only a fraction of the fe that are doped into the system would take part in the ferromagnetic long range order @xcite",
    ". however , the model is expected to work as long as there are mobile electrons coupled to a relatively localized spin background .",
    "we have been discussing in this work the carrier - mediated ferromagnetism which is believed to explain the magnetic properties of various dilute magnetic semiconductors with available free charge carriers @xcite . for relatively localized systems with no free carriers other alternative mechanisms such as that of the bound magnetic polaron model have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "one such example is ga(mn)n where it has been suggested that the mn ions are in d@xmath111 configuration plus a localized hole and this localized hole forms a singlet with a mn d - electron ( zhang - rice polaron ) which then moves through the mn sublattice and mediates ferromagnetic order@xcite .    the system we consider in this work is different from other iii - iv or ii - vi semiconductors in some respects .",
    "first of all the doping concentration ( 50@xmath17 or 25@xmath17 ) is quite high compared to , for example , the 6@xmath17 doping in ga(mn)n .",
    "secondly there is a possibility of fe having a mixed valence state of fe@xmath2/fe@xmath12 .",
    "thirdly the existence of two kinds of crystalline environment to which fe can be doped is not present in the known dms semiconductors .",
    "dms systems like ga(mn)as have indeed shown dependence of t@xmath112 on the so called antisite defects .",
    "long range order in dms systems is known to show sensitivity to disorder as well .",
    "but in the present context , disorder ( which we did not consider ) may not be that crucial for the underlying mechanism of magnetism proposed . unlike the usual dms materials , the doping is fairly high to be in the impurity dominated regime",
    ". the disorder may affect the values of exchange interaction and electron mobility , thereby shifting the phase boundaries slightly , but the overall topology of the ground state phase diagram will remain unaffected .",
    "therefore , we believe that at least to a first approximation , effects of disorder could be neglected .    finally , concerning the model ( eq . [ h0 ] ) , there are also very interesting issues related to it like the possibility of phase separation and canted spin structures , possible orbital ordering and low dimensional spin orders which have not been investigated here .",
    "in conclusion , based on the band structure results we have presented an effective model for magnetism in fe doped znga@xmath0o@xmath4which predicts a stable ferromagnetic phase when both fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath12 valence states are present . if only fe@xmath12 is present -as reported in the mossbauer spectroscopy@xcite- it is not possible to get ferromagnetism via this model , an insulating afm state would have been the most likely ground state . as the system is not very dilute and the transition temperature is quite high , it is likely that ferromagnetism in this system is driven by the kinetic energy of mobile electrons via double exchange rather than interaction between localized impurities .",
    "a high degree of delocalization of the extra electron in fe@xmath2 could also explain the observation of only fe@xmath12 states in the mossbauer experiments .",
    "more experiments are needed to be done in order to unambiguously detect the states of fe in znga@xmath0o@xmath4 .",
    "a study of the ground states for a range of doping concentrations would be very useful .",
    "photoemission experiments backed by detailed first principle calculations are also indispensable to delineate the relevant orbitals that participate in the double exchange mechanism .",
