    "the description of the odderon @xcite within qcd @xcite was in recent years the subject of several studies @xcite .",
    "being a partner of the pomeron @xcite which carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum and which is well known from the study of diffractive processes , the odderon still remains a mistery .",
    "although it differs from the pomeron only by its charge conjugation property and from the point of view of general principles one could expect that its exchange leads to effects of a comparable magnitude to those with the pomeron exchange , the odderon still escapes experimental verification .",
    "the qcd predictions lead to a rather small cross section for the diffractive @xmath1production @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies of exclusive @xmath2production at hera @xcite show also a very small cross section for this process , which stays in contradiction with theoretical predictions based on the stochastic vacuum model @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "because of these difficulties a new approach to odderon search is required . in ref .  @xcite it was proposed to search for odderon effects by studying the charge asymmetries in open charm production , which are linear in the odderon scattering amplitude",
    ". these ideas were further developed in @xcite where it was proposed to study odderon effects in the soft photoproduction of two pions .",
    "in two recent papers @xcite we proposed to study the diffractive electroproduction of a @xmath3 pair to search for the qcd - odderon at the amplitude level .",
    "the main difference of our studies of the electroproduction process with respect to refs .",
    "@xcite is to work in a perturbative framework which we believe enables us to derive more founded predictions in an accessible kinematical domain .",
    "we study the electroproduction of @xmath0 pair which proceeds through a virtual photon - proton reaction @xmath4    in the born approximation the pomeron exchange is described by two gluon exchange in a colour singlet state ( see fig .  1 ) and the scattering amplitude in the impact representation has the form of a convolution in the 2-dimensional transverse momentum space    @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the impact factors for the transition @xmath9 via pomeron exchange and of the nucleon in the initial state @xmath10 into the nucleon in the final state @xmath11 .    the corresponding representation for the odderon exchange , _",
    "i.e. _ the exchange of three gluons in a colour singlet state , is given by the formula ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding impact factors for the same transitions via odderon exchange .    the impact factors in eqs .",
    "( [ pom ] ) and ( [ odd ] ) involve hard parts calculated perturbatively by standard methods and nonperturbative light - cone generalized distribution amplitudes ( gda ) @xcite describing the transition of a @xmath17 pair into the @xmath18 final state .",
    "the choice of appropriate two pion gdas is a point of crucial importance .",
    "we parametrize them according to results of recent studies @xcite .",
    "the gpd related to the odderon exchange involves ( see @xcite for details ) the @xmath19 and @xmath20 partial waves contributions corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 meson poles in the @xmath23 elastic scattering .",
    "the gpd coupled with pomeron exchange involves a @xmath24 partial wave described by the phase shift and breit - wigner formula for the @xmath25meson",
    ".    the second important point of our approach is the choice of the impact factor describing the pomeron and the odderon coupling to the target nucleon .",
    "here we are forced to use phenomenological models derived to fit hadronic data @xcite .",
    "the charge asymmetry is defined as @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where the differential cross section @xmath29 is a function of the cms scattering energy square @xmath30 , the photon virtuality @xmath31 , the momentum transfer square @xmath32 , the invariant mass of the pion pair @xmath33 , the longitudinal momentum fraction of the initial electron carried by the photon @xmath34 , the polar decay angle ( in the cms of the pion pair ) @xmath35 , the azimuthal angle @xmath36 between the leptonic plane and the plane of reaction ( [ gp ] ) and of the helicity of the scattered electron @xmath37 .",
    "this asymmetry is a measure of the difference between the number of events in which the @xmath38 is produced in forward hemisphere ( in the cms of the pion pair ) and in the backward hemisphere .    introducing the reduced scattering amplitude @xmath39 for transversely polarized photons : @xmath40 the numerator @xmath41 and denominator @xmath42 of the asymmetry have the forms @xmath43 \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath44 @xmath45 + 2(1+(1-y)^{2}+2(1-y)\\cos 2\\alpha ) \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath46 \\label{nomca}\\ ] ] and    @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 + ( 1+(1-y)^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath50    as one example of our results we present in fig .  2 a plot of the charge asymmetry as a function of the two pion invariant mass @xmath51 and for the typical for hera values of the other parameters .",
    "the error band corresponds to a variation of @xmath52 and the soft coupling constant in the impact factor @xmath53 .",
    "the characteristic @xmath54dependence of the asymmetry is completely understood in terms of the @xmath55 phase shifts @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and its dependence on them @xmath59 .",
    "the important source of corrections to above prediction is due to the effects of @xmath60 threshold in description of asymmetries for @xmath61gev .",
    "the example of their magnitude is presented in fig .  3 which shows the effect of taking into account the inelasticity factor @xmath62 @xcite in the scattering amplitude .",
    "we see that the charge asymmetry still remains sizable and it has a characteristic pattern .",
    "the spin asymmetry related to the polarizations of incomming electron and it is defined as @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 with the numerator given by @xmath66 @xmath67 \\label{nomsa}\\ ] ] while @xmath42 is of course the same quantity as in the case of the charge asymmetry ( [ denca ] ) . in fig .",
    "3 we show the plot of spin asymmetry . comparing it with fig .",
    "2 we conclude that the magnitude of spin asymmetry is quite small .",
    "l. szymanowski : the motivation of our work was rather reverse : we tried to evaluate asymmetries assuming that we know gdas .",
    "of course if the data on asymmetries will be precise enough one could also think to do what you ask .",
