    "the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) acquires properties akin to those of ordinary polarizable matter when subjected to strong electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these fields can couple to electron - positron fluctuations inducing nonlinear interactions ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . the spatial and temporal scale associated to these electron - positron fluctuations",
    "is set by the compton wavelength @xmath0 and the compton time @xmath1 of the electron respectively , where @xmath2 denotes the electron mass . at leading order in the field strengths prominent signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities such as vacuum magnetic birefringence @xcite and direct light - by - light scattering @xcite",
    "are mediated by an effective four - photon interaction .",
    "the resulting nonlinear interactions among laboratory electromagnetic fields are suppressed by powers of the field strength ratio @xmath3 , with @xmath4 denoting the electric / magnetic field amplitude and @xmath5 the critical field strength .",
    "hence , experimental verifications @xcite have so far been limited to high - energy experiments probing vacuum nonlinearities in the strong coulomb fields in the vicinity of highly charged ions ( delbrck - scattering @xcite and photon splitting @xcite ) .",
    "vacuum nonlinearities in macroscopic electromagnetic fields have not been directly verified so far .",
    "direct searches of vacuum magnetic birefringence in macroscopic magnetic fields @xcite for instance , have already demonstrated that a combination of both high field strength as well as a high signal detection sensitivity will eventually be needed for a first discovery , see @xcite for a recent proposal .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent technological advances in the development of high - intensity lasers have begun to access new extreme - field territory .",
    "the perspective to directly probe quantum vacuum nonlinearities in all - optical pump - probe type set - ups is most promising : one high - intensity laser ( `` pump '' ) generates a strong electromagnetic field pulse polarizing the quantum vacuum in its focus , which is then probed by a second high - intensity laser .",
    "a prominent example is the fundamental physics program within the hibef project @xcite , which plans to combine a near - infrared petawatt ( pw ) laser as pump and the european xfel as probe laser aiming to detect vacuum birefringence @xcite , see also @xcite for related work .",
    "while the advantage of using ultra - intense lasers is obvious from the accessible field strengths , important progress also has been made on the detection side in the form of high - purity x - ray polarimetry @xcite .",
    "further attractive theoretical proposals have focused on optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities based on interference effects @xcite , photon - photon scattering in the form of laser - pulse collisions @xcite and quantum reflection @xcite .    in some of these studies ,",
    "a new ingredient in addition to extreme fields and high detection efficiencies has been identified : as laser pulses feature an intrinsic spatio - temporal structure , these spacetime inhomogeneities allow for a richer variety of quantum vacuum signatures that remains invisible in the idealized theoretical limit of constant homogeneous fields .    to this end ,",
    "recently a representation of the one - loop photon polarization tensor @xmath6 ( photon two - point function ) in the limit of low energies and momenta and for slowly varying but otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic field inhomogeneities has been derived @xcite .",
    "note that essentially all macroscopic electromagnetic fields attainable in the laboratory fall into this category , as they vary on scales much larger than the compton wavelength and time of the electron .",
    "this result facilitates a straightforward investigation of photon propagation effects in high - intensity laser fields .",
    "whereas constant electromagnetic fields only affect a probe photon s polarization properties , inhomogeneous fields may additionally alter its frequency and wave vector , which can be employed to physically separate the ( tiny ) amount of photons carrying the signature from a large background consisting of probe photons unaffected by quantum vacuum nonlinearities ; inhomogeneities thus become the key ingredient for some phenomena such as quantum reflection @xcite .    besides propagation effects , photons in strong electromagnetic fields",
    "can also experience splitting @xcite and merging @xcite .",
    "photon splitting describes processes where a single photon splits into two or more outgoing photons under the influence of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "photon merging can be viewed as the inverse process : two or more photons merge under the influence of the external field , yielding a single outgoing photon .",
    "the first detailed investigation of photon splitting has been performed by adler in 1971 @xcite , who considered this process in a constant , purely magnetic background field .    in this work",
    "we aim at adopting the strategy devised in @xcite to study photon splitting and merging in the strong , inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields attainable with high - intensity laser experiments .",
    "for this , we start in sect .  [",
    "sec : poltensor ] by deriving the `` three - photon polarization tensor '' @xmath7 to one - loop order in the limit of low energies and momenta and for weakly - varying but otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "this quantity describes the effective interaction between three photon fields facilitated by vacuum fluctuations in the presence of external electromagnetic fields .",

    "sec : mergsplit ] , we consider a specific field amplitude profile and compare the magnitudes of the numbers of photons experiencing photon splitting and merging in this field inhomogeneity .",

    ", this lagrangian can now be applied locally . in the present work ,",

    "an analogous idea has originally been adopted by adler @xcite and bialynicka - birula @xcite in the 1970s to study photon splitting .",
    "still , it is important to realize that the same line or reasoning also applies to slowly varying fields with parametrically suppressed errors which are quantified below .",
    "the photon polarization tensor derived in this way is manifestly restricted to low four - momentum transfers ; i.e. , also the probe photons have to be slowly varying .",
    "let us emphasize that this procedure manifestly preserves gauge invariance and therefore retains complete information about the polarization properties of the involved photons for any given slowly varying background field inhomogeneity .",

    "<S> we put special emphasis on deviations from the well - known constant field results , also revisiting the selection rules for these processes . in the context of high - intensity laser facilities , we analytically determine compact expressions for the number of merged / split photons as obtained in the focal spots of intense laser beams . for the parameter range of a typical petawatt class laser system as pump and a terawatt class laser as probe </S>",
    "<S> , we provide estimates for the numbers of signal photons attainable in an actual experiment . the combination of frequency upshifting , polarization dependence and scattering off the inhomogeneities renders photon merging an ideal signature for the experimental exploration of nonlinear quantum vacuum properties . </S>"
