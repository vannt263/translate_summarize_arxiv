    "in general , it is expected that the surface impedance of high - temperature superconducting ( hts ) thin films will increase as a function of applied dc or mw field .",
    "this nonlinearity was believed to be mainly contributed by weak links and vortex dynamics in the hts films @xcite . besides",
    ", other sources of nonlinearity , such as intrinsic pairbreaking , local heating of grain boundaries and thermal switch of superconducting grains , were also introduced to explain the diverged experimental data@xcite .",
    "recently , several anomalous microwave responses , i.e. surface resistance r@xmath4 and ( or ) surface reactance x@xmath4 change non - monotonically with applied mw or dc magnetic field , were observed @xcite .",
    "choudhury @xmath11 @xmath12 . reported an anomalous field dependence of surface resistance r@xmath4 of a ybco suspended line resonator in the presence of a weak , perpendicular dc magnetic field at 10k .",
    "they found a sharp decrease of r@xmath4 at small h@xmath3 ( @xmath135 gauss ) with subsequent increase at higher fields .",
    "hein @xmath11 @xmath12 . observed a correlated reduction in r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 of epitaxial ybco films in both dc and mw magnetic fields of the scale 20 mt at frequencies f=8.5 and 77 ghz and temperatures t=77 and 4.2k , respectively .",
    "the field effects on r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 were found to correlate within the framework of the two - fluid model ( tfm ) . the reduction in r@xmath4 and",
    "x@xmath4 was attributed to magnetic field - induced suppression of the spin - flip scattering rate .",
    "similar effects were also reported by kharel and his colleagues . besides correlated changes in r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 , uncorrelated non - monotonic field dependence was also observed in their measurement of ybco coplanar resonators at 8.0ghz and different temperatures ( 15 , 35 and 75k ) . as far as we know , the origins of these anomalous microwave responses are still pending and the experimental data are very limited .",
    "more experimental investigations are needed to give enough clues for learning the mechanisms underneath the anomalous effects .    in this work",
    ", we employed a microstrip resonator technique to measure r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 of ybco thin films in dc magnetic fields h@xmath3 up to 200 gauss at 77k .",
    "it was observed that r@xmath4 decreases as h@xmath3 raises from zero and this is followed by a monotonically increase of r@xmath4 at higher h@xmath3 .",
    "correlatively , x@xmath4 show a similar behaivior .",
    "the effects were investigated at different mw amplitudes and frequencies in different dc field alignments .",
    "the experimental data have been examined with several theoretical models .",
    "the double - sided ybco thin films were prepared by on - axis pulsed - laser deposition ( pld ) technique on polished laalo@xmath14 ( 100 ) substrates with the size of 15@xmath1510@xmath150.5 mm@xmath16 .",
    "the films are 400 nm thick and show a strong preferential orientation with the c - axis perpendicular to the film surface .",
    "the afm results show that the grain sizes of both faces of the double - sided films are around 1@xmath17m@xmath151@xmath17 m and the root - mean - square ( rms ) surface roughness of both faces in a 50@xmath17m@xmath1550@xmath17 m area are similar , around 170 nm while their mean roughness are also similar , which are around 130 nm . the dc critical current density j@xmath5 is in excess of 10@xmath18a/@xmath19 at 77k and the transition temperature t@xmath5 is around 90k with a narrow transition width , 0.5@xmath131k .",
    "employing a dielectric resonant cavity @xcite , the surface resistances of the films were measured at 10.66ghz , 77k before patterning .",
    "the resultant r@xmath4 are around 1 m@xmath20 and the difference of the surface resistance between the two sides is smaller than 5% .    the design of the microstrip resonator was done with the help of a commercial full wave electromagnetic simulator , ie3d , and the quasi - tem analytical formulations @xcite for microstrip resonator .",
    "the resonator geometry is chosen so that it has a characteristic impedance of 50@xmath20 .",
    "the meandering microstrip has a width of 169 @xmath17 m and is coupled with the outer circuits by a capacitive gap of 500 @xmath17 m .",
    "the traditional wet etching method was employed to fabricate the microstrip resonator .",
    "we have checked the geometry of the resonator after the etching process and found the actual strip width is around 4@xmath17 m narrower than the designed value .",
    "the microwave responses of the resonators were measured at 77k using a vector network analyzer and the dc magnetic field was applied by a copper solenoid .",
    "there is no remanent field in the measurements since all the experimental set - ups are made of teflon except the copper solenoid .",
    "the changes in surface impedance associated with the application of dc magnetic field are extracted from the measured quantities as follow @xcite : @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a geometric factor determined from the sample dimensions , f@xmath23 and @xmath24f@xmath25 are the resonance frequency and the @xmath263db ( half power ) bandwidth of the resonance peak , respectively . the loaded quality factor q@xmath27 of the resonator can be easily obtained from f@xmath23 and @xmath24f@xmath25 , q@xmath27=f@xmath23/@xmath24f@xmath25 .",
    "we replace q@xmath27 with unloaded quality factor because the coupling is very weak ( insertion loss@xmath830db ) .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the typical data for @xmath24f@xmath25 , which is proportional to r@xmath4 , of the fundamental resonant peak as a function of applied dc field h@xmath3 .",
    "the input mw power was fixed at @xmath2610dbm and the sample was initially cooled in a zero - field state where the earth magnetic field ( @xmath130.3 gauss ) was neglected .",
    "we do not give absolute values of r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 because @xmath22 is difficult to be determined for the current in the microstrip is highly non - uniform @xcite .",
    "fortunately , only the functional dependence of @xmath24z@xmath4 and the ratio of @xmath24r@xmath4 and @xmath24x@xmath4 are of importance to learn the mechanisms of microwave nonlinearity and they can be determined without the geometric factor . for the case h@xmath3 was applied parallel to the @xmath28-axis of the film ( namely , perpendicular to the surface of the film ) , r@xmath4 drops dramatically as h@xmath3 is increased from zero . after passing through a minimum , r@xmath4 begin to increase monotonically when h@xmath3 is further raised .",
    "the minimum depth is 23% of the r@xmath4 value in zero dc field and the crossover field ( h@xmath29 ) is 4.5 gauss , which is of the same order of that reported by choudhury @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the shift of the resonant frequency , f@xmath23 , shown in figure 1(b ) reveals that the change of x@xmath4 is correlated with that of r@xmath4 .",
    "the resonant peak initially shifts to higher frequency ( x@xmath4 decreases , correspondingly ) and then shifts down .",
    "the h@xmath29 value determined from x@xmath4(h@xmath3 ) is the same as that from r@xmath4(h@xmath3 ) within 1.5 gauss .",
    "the general features observed above were presented again for h@xmath3@xmath30@xmath28 while the crossover field h@xmath31 is of the order 80@xmath1390 gauss .",
    "the difference between h@xmath31 and h@xmath32 may come from the serious demagnetizing effect and the anisotropy of the hts film .",
    "the insets in fig.1 show the curves normalised with h@xmath31 and h@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the two curves almost collapse to one .",
    "the implication of this result will be discussed below .",
    "similar effects are observed as the input power is varied .",
    "fig.2 shows the @xmath24f@xmath25 versus h@xmath3 with different orientations when the input mw power is fixed at @xmath2620dbm .",
    "no shift of the crossover field h@xmath5 , which represents h@xmath3@xmath30@xmath28 or h@xmath3@xmath33@xmath28 , at different mw power levels is observed within the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "it means that h@xmath5 is independent of the amplitude of the input microwave signal .",
    "however , the decrease in r@xmath4 is more prominent than that of p=@xmath2610dbm .",
    "the minimum depth in this case is as large as 43% of the zero - dc field r@xmath4 value .",
    "the same measurements were also carried out for different resonant modes ( second and third harmonics ) , shown in fig.3(a ) .",
    "the field dependencies of r@xmath4 for different resonant modes are qualitatively the same . r@xmath4 first decreases with h@xmath3 and then increase after h@xmath3 reaches the crossover field h@xmath5 .",
    "the crossover fields h@xmath5 measured from the second and third modes are almost the same as that from the fundamental mode .",
    "thus h@xmath5 is also independent of the frequency of the input mw signals .",
    "as is well known , the frequency dependence of r@xmath4 is an important key in the determination of the microwave loss mechanism . to shed some light on the microwave loss mechanism in the applied dc magnetic field with different magnitudes",
    ", we chose three typical h@xmath3 : zero dc field , h@xmath5 and a field larger than h@xmath5 to plot the @xmath263db bandwidth as a function of the harmonic numbers , as shown in fig.3(b ) .",
    "nearly linear frequency dependencies of r@xmath4 are found for all the three values of h@xmath3 and even the slopes of the three curves are almost independent of h@xmath3 .",
    "the similarity in the frequency dependence of r@xmath4 would suggest the microwave loss mechanisms at the three dc fields are essentially the same as each others .",
    "the linear frequency dependence rules out the loss mechanisms with f@xmath34 dependence , such as two fluid model @xcite , bcs theory @xcite and weakly coupled grain model @xcite .",
    "and it implies that the hysteretic losses due to pinning and nucleation of josephson fluxons @xcite may play an important role in the loss mechanism .",
    "although the loss mechanism is almost same in our measurements , the effect of h@xmath3 on the loss mechanism is totally different for the case h@xmath3@xmath6 h@xmath5 and h@xmath3@xmath8h@xmath5 . to illustrate the effect of the applied dc field",
    ", we adopt an impedance plane analysis , which has been proven to be a powerful approach in distinguishing between various nonlinear mechanisms of superconductors , in terms of r - parameter @xcite . here",
    "the dc field - induced changes in the surface impedance are characterised by a dimensionless r@xmath9 which is defined as the ratio of the change of surface resistance and reactance with varing h@xmath3 at fixed input mw powers , i.e. , r@xmath9 = @xmath24r@xmath4(h@xmath3)/@xmath24x@xmath4(h@xmath3 ) .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates @xmath24f@xmath25 versus f@xmath23 dependencies at p@xmath35=@xmath2610dbm for varied h@xmath3 values and for different orientations of the applied dc magnetic field .",
    "the r@xmath9-parameter can be easily extracted from the slopes of the curves ( r@xmath9 is one - half of the slope ) .",
    "the obtained value for r@xmath9 is about 0.6 if h@xmath3 is below h@xmath5 , while r@xmath9@xmath130.1 if the dc field is above h@xmath5 .",
    "the transition of r@xmath9 happens within a narrow field range at the crossover dc field .",
    "the prominent difference in the values of r@xmath9 implies that the dc field below h@xmath5 plays a different role with that above h@xmath3 in determining the surface impedance .",
    "it is noted that the r@xmath9@xmath130.1 at h@xmath3@xmath8 h@xmath5 is consistent with the r@xmath9 values ( 0.1 - 0.2 ) reported by other groups @xcite .",
    "the impedance plane analysis at p@xmath35=@xmath2620dbm presents a similar behavior .",
    "it shound be stressed that fig.4 is qualitatively different from the similar analysis given in fig.5 of ref .",
    "this suggests that the anomalous response reported by hein @xmath11 @xmath12 . and",
    "what observed in this work may come from different origins .",
    "in addition , fig.4 shows that for different orientations of h@xmath3 ( h@xmath3@xmath33@xmath28 and h@xmath10@xmath30@xmath28 ) the two sets of data points essentially coincide with each other on the same curve .",
    "as shown in the insets of figure 1 , the r@xmath4(h@xmath3 ) and x@xmath4(h@xmath3 ) curves with different h@xmath3 orientations can also be normalised to coincide with each other . combining these observations together ,",
    "we conclude that the effects of h@xmath3 on the surface impedance are essentially independent on the orientations of the applied dc magnetic field .",
    "three samples were measured in this work . though quantitative differences are found , the features of the data are essentially the same as mentioned above .",
    "the quantitative diferences may come from the differences on growth , deposition and patterning of the films .",
    "the results show that h@xmath5 is independent of both the amplitude and frequency of the applied microwave signal .",
    "it implies that h@xmath5 may be related to some characteristic parameters of the ybco films . since the effects of dc magnetic field change dramatically at h@xmath5",
    ", one could naturally expect that the observed h@xmath5 in the measurements is simply a manifestation of h@xmath36 , the lower critical field of the superconducting ybco films .",
    "below h@xmath5 , the external dc field causes a decrease in r@xmath4 for some reasons . above h@xmath5",
    ", the dc fluxons begin to penetrate into the samples and produce additional loss with a large increase of the surface impedance .",
    "this may give an qualitative description on some features of the anomalous effect mentioned above .",
    "however , we can not definitely clarify the relationship of h@xmath5 to h@xmath36 while the origin of the drop in r@xmath4 is still not known .",
    "the conception , which says the observed h@xmath5 is a manifestation of h@xmath36 , needs to be further studied .",
    "recently , several groups proposed that magnetic field - induced recovery of superconductivity might account for the anomalous microwave response @xcite .",
    "magnetic impurities are likely to be present in most hts materials .",
    "the interaction between localised magnetic moments of magnetic impurities and cooper pairs which are in the singlet state destroys the pair correlation and is accompanied by spin - flip scattering @xcite .",
    "an external magnetic field forces the localised magnetic moments to align , frustrates the spin - flip scattering , and leads to a reduction of pair breaking . according to two - fluid model the increase of pair electrons can lead to the decrease of r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 .",
    "this mechanism has been proven to be effective in explaining some of the experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , it is obvious that the feature of fig.4 is qualitatively different from that of the similar analysis given in fig.5 of ref.[17 ] .",
    "so it is doubtful that the anomalous response we observed comes from the same origin as that in ref.[17 ] .",
    "in addition , a phenomenological description is proposed in terms of this mechanism @xcite .",
    "simulation shows that quantitative fitting of the experimental data with this model requires a large increase of pair density ( @xmath850% ) with a relatively small change of external field ( 80@xmath1390 gauss ) .",
    "so the applicability of this mechanism to the present experimental results is questionable .",
    "a phenomenological model of the nonlinear microwave response of a superconducting weak link was proposed by velichko to describe the effect of both dc and mw magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the results show that the value of z@xmath4(h ) of both `` the non - shunted '' and `` the shunted wl '' can fall with increased h under certain conditions .",
    "however , the observed correlated decrease in r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 still can not be explained by the model .",
    "for `` the non - shunted wl '' , r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 initially increase as h raises from zero and then decrease with elevated magnetic field , which is inconsistent with our experimental observation .",
    "for `` the shunted wl '' , a decrease in r@xmath4 is accompanied by an increase of x@xmath4 .",
    "this is also inconsistent with our data .",
    "as shown by herd @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    ", however , if a network of weak links with a distribution of the i@xmath5r@xmath37 products was considered , the decrease of x@xmath4 with h can be expected @xcite .",
    "it is not sure whether a network of `` the shunt wl '' can account for the decrease of both r@xmath4 and x@xmath4 .",
    "similar effects were once observed by thompson @xmath11",
    "@xmath12 @xcite . in the measurements of ac hysteretic losses in nb@xmath1ge material . with fixed ac amplitude ,",
    "the ac loss was observed initially decrease and then increase with elevated dc - bias magnetic field after passing through a minimum .",
    "the decrease of ac losses was explained in terms of abrikosov vortex - antivortex annihilation within the frame of critical state model @xcite .",
    "one of the central features of this theory lies in an ac amplitude - dependent h@xmath5 at which ac loss reaches its minimum . while this feature was observed in thompson s experiment , it is opposite to our observation . as we mentioned above ,",
    "h@xmath5 is almost independent of the amplitude of the input mw signal .",
    "so far the observed anomalous microwave response can not be explained consistently by any of the proposed models .",
    "it is generally expected that both of the intrinsic and extrinsic effects in the hts thin films may have their contributions to the microwave loss . to get a clear understanding of the anomalous effect",
    ", all these effects should be taken into account .",
    "the high value of r@xmath4 ( @xmath13 1m@xmath20 at 10.66 ghz , 77k ) shows that the films used in this work are highly granular and most likely consist of a microbridge - type weak links .",
    "the weak links may play an important role in the anomalous effects though the mechanism is not known at present .",
    "as we know , granularity has been ruled out as a general source of the anomaly observed in their experiments since their films showed well - established qualities and excellent power handling capabilities .",
    "this can also explain why fig.4 is qulitatively different from the fig.5 in ref.17 .",
    "this suggest that the anomalous effects may have more than one source .",
    "we have observed an anomalous microwave response in hts thin - film microstrip resonators .",
    "the main results of this work are summarized as follows : ( a ) the surface resistance and reactance show a correlated non - monotonic behavior in the presence of a weak dc magnetic field .",
    "the r@xmath4 drops as h@xmath3 raises from zero , after passing through a minimum , it increases gradually as h@xmath3 is further increased .",
    "the x@xmath4 presents a similar behavior ; ( b ) the crossover field h@xmath5 , at which r@xmath4 reaches its minimum , is independent of the amplitude and frequency of the input microwave signal within the ranges of measurements ; ( c ) the qualitative effects of h@xmath3 on the surface impedance are essentially independent of dc field orientation , microwave amplitude and frequency , while prominently different at h@xmath3@xmath6h@xmath5 ( r@xmath9@xmath130.6 ) and at h@xmath3@xmath8h@xmath5 ( r@xmath9@xmath130.1 ) ; ( d ) at a fixed h@xmath3 and p@xmath35 , the frequency dependence of the surface resistance is almost linear .",
    "this linear frequency dependence and even the slope of r@xmath4-f are unchanged at varied h@xmath3 magnitudes ( @xmath6h@xmath5 , @xmath7h@xmath5 and @xmath8h@xmath5 ) .",
    "several mechanisms were examined and they can not give a satisfactory explanation on the results .",
    "the origin of the observed anomaly is still not clear .",
    "further efforts should be addressed to understand it fully .",
