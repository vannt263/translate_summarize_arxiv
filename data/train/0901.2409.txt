    "in the 1960s , one of the mysteries of strong interactions was the enormous proliferation of strong interacting particles or hadrons , which in addition , exhibit a striking property : the more massive the particles , the higher their spin with a linear correlations between the square of the particle mass and its spin . in regge theory",
    "@xcite this correlation is described in the complex angular momentum plane by linear regge trajectories . in this phenomenological approach diffraction",
    "corresponds to the exchange of the pomeron trajectory , which has the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "pomeron trajectory exchanges dominate at high energies and its parameters have been derived from fits to the data of soft hadron - hadron interactions  @xcite .",
    "the study of the hadronic structure performed at large centre - of - mass energies in @xmath0 collisions at the tevatron and in deep inelastic @xmath1 scattering ( dis ) at hera offer unique way to understand diffraction in terms of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd)(see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . within the qcd framework",
    "diffractive events can be interpreted as processes in which a colour singlet combination of partons is exchanged .",
    "the structure of the colour singlet can be studied using a qcd approach based on the hard scattering collinear factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "it states that the diffractive cross section is a product of diffractive proton parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) and partonic hard scattering cross sections .",
    "dpdfs are universal for diffractive @xmath1 dis processes ( inclusive , dijet and charm production ) and obey the dglap evolution equations .",
    "their extraction from inclusive diffractive processes and application to the analysis of diffractive dijet and charm production provides a test of qcd factorisation .",
    "moreover , dijet and charm production data , directly sensitive to the gluon density in the colour singlet , can help in constraining the dpdfs when included in global fits .",
    "the h1 and zeus experiments at hera study processes of electron - proton dis , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hadronic final state .",
    "a considerable part of the dis cross section ( @xmath4 ) comes from diffractive processes which are characterized by the presence of a leading proton in the final state carrying most of the proton beam energy and by a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) in the forward ( proton ) direction .",
    "r0.25        figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows a schematic diagram of the diffractive process @xmath5 together with the relevant kinematic variables : the photon virtuality , @xmath6 , the photon - proton centre - of - mass energy , @xmath7 , and the square of the four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , @xmath8 .",
    "relevant kinematic variables in diffraction are the fraction of the proton longitudinal momentum carried by the exchanged colour singlet object , @xmath9 , and the fraction of the exchanged momentum carried by the quark coupling to the virtual photon , @xmath10 .    in analogy with the structure function @xmath11 for inclusive dis",
    "the cross section of diffractive @xmath1 scattering is parameterized in terms of the diffractive structure function @xmath12 .",
    "diffractive processes at hera are selected in several ways : by requiring the presence of a large rapidity gap ( lrg method  @xcite ) , by observing a leading proton in the final state by means of a dedicated leading proton spectrometer ( lp method  @xcite ) or by studying the hadronic mass spectrum observed in the central detector ( @xmath13 method  @xcite ) to determine the diffractive contribution statistically .",
    "the different methods treat in different ways the contribution of non - diffractive processes , like exchanges of the sub - leading regge trajectories , and the background from proton dissociation processes .",
    "the zeus experiment presented  @xcite the diffractive inclusive dis results obtained with all the three experimental methods  @xcite , and their comparison to h1 recent results obtained with the lrg and lp methods  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with the three methods were compared in bins of @xmath13 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 in terms of the diffractive reduced cross section , @xmath14 .",
    "the latter coincides with the diffractive structure function , @xmath15 , if the ratio of the cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarised virtual photons is neglected . the reduced cross section @xmath16 is integrated over @xmath8 for the lrg and @xmath13 methods which do not allow a direct measurement of @xmath8 , possible only with the lp method .",

    "these issues are addressed in a certain approximation by a dipole model and a @xmath118 factorization method , which foundations are closely related to the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) formalism for a resummation of large logarithms of energy .",
    "these approaches look particulary attractive since they allow to incorporate unitarity corrections in a simple , though still model dependent , way .",
    "k. kumeriki reported new leading twist qcd analysis of dvcs @xcite .",
    "this process considered to be the cleanest way to access generalized parton densities ( gpds ) . the level of sophistication in the description of exclusive dvcs process is reaching now the one we have for the inclusive dis .",
    "the analysis was performed including in some approximation the perturbative corrections up to the next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "this work relies on an expansion in series of the conformal moments and a subsequent analytical continuation in the moment index .",
    "this procedure has much in common with the known complex angular momentum techniques and allows not only to build effective numerical algorithms but also to get a new insight into the modeling of gpds .",
    "good fit to the low-@xmath111 zeus and h1 data was reached .",
    "the main conclusion is that the perturbative corrections seem to be under control in the hera kinematic region . though the convergency of the perturbative series for dvcs depends much on the input for the gluon gpd at the initial scale of the qcd evolution .",
    "it becomes in general progressively worse when one approaches the region of very low-@xmath111 .",
    "exclusive vm production processes provide another exiting insight into gpd physics .",
    "contrary to the dvcs case the gluon gpd enters in the description of neutral vm production at the leading order .",
    "this allows to constrain gluon .",
    "the quality of data for exclusive vm is impressive .",
    "however , from the theory site it is harder to analyse them , as both the known nlo perturbative corrections @xcite and the existing model predictions for higher twist effects are much larger than for dvcs .",
    "p. kroll presented a comprehensive study of vm production @xcite . in this approach",
    "the @xmath119 channel exchange is treated collinearly , in the frame of leading order gpd formalism , whereas the transition of a virtual photon into vm is described in a modified factorization scheme , similar to the one proposed by lee and sterman for more simple exclusive reactions @xcite .",
    "it allows to describe electroproduction of transversely polarized vm , which is of higher twist , and it provides a model for power suppressed contributions in vm production .",
    "the results of @xcite reproduce fairly well many features of the data from both the fixed target and the hera collider experiments .",
    "m. diehl presented an overview of some recent developments ( mostly not presented at the workshop ) in the theory and phenomenology of gpds .",
    "it concerns both the gpd modeling and the extraction of gpds from the exclusive reactions data @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that the twist 4 contribution to the longitudinal part of inclusive diffraction structure function @xmath120 dominates the leading twist 2 one at @xmath121 ( i.e. at small diffractive masses , @xmath122 ) ; the twist 2 vanishes as @xmath121 , while its the higher twist counterpart not .",
    "k. colec - biernat reported the analysis @xcite of the diffractive hera data which includes this important twist 4 contribution to @xmath120 within the model provided by @xcite .",
    "the most important result of this study in comparison to the standard qcd leading twist fit is that the higher twist significantly enhances @xmath120 at @xmath123 and leads to the extracted twist 2 gluon diffractive distribution which is strongly peaked near @xmath124 .",
    "it calls for a direct measurement of @xmath120 at large @xmath10 in hera experiments .",
    "hard diffraction in hadron collisions in general and especially a description of central exclusive production processes represents the real challenge for a theory .",
    "there is no factorization theorem for these reactions .",
    "therefore we relay here more on a physical intuition and on a phenomenological experience rather than on some systematic expansion .",
    "valery khoze presented an approach developed by the durham group @xcite .",
    "it was used for the predictions of cep of higgs boson ; both in the standard model @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "the cross section of cep di - jet production predicted within this approach agrees with recent cdf measurement @xcite .",
    "valery stressed that the method involves a number of nontrivial steps which may be tested to some extend separately , studying various diffraction processes in early lhc data .",
    "in particular it involves an assumption that the rescattering effects are related with the soft pomeron exchanges of the eikonal type and can be parameterized using elastic and quasy - elastic proton - proton scattering data .",
    "however , more complicated rescattering mechanisms that involve the pomeron loops were found in @xcite .",
    "j. miller presented the model calculation of such enchanced pomeron loop diagrams .",
    "effectively it results in a much larger prediction for the gap survival suppression @xcite .",
    "more discussion of these issues were given by m. diehl @xcite .",
    "j. nystrand discussed the exclusive vm production in ultra - peripheral photon collisions at the lhc and tevatron @xcite , including an interesting interference effect between the photon - pomeron and the pomeron - photon production mechanisms .",
    "the outlook for the lhc is promising .",
    "the theory predictions depend strongly on the input for vm photoproduction amplitude in the energy region not explored so far in hera experiments .",
    "these processes should be a good testing ground for both our knowledge of the gluon at low - x and for our understanding of the production mechanism .",
    "another exiting possibility is related with the photon - photon induced processes at the lhc .",
    "o. kepka showed that the potential of @xmath125 collisions can be used to put stronger constrains on the anomalous @xmath126 triple gauge boson vertex @xcite .",
    "g. watt discussed the exclusive photo- and electroproduction processes within the color dipole picture @xcite . in this case",
    "it requires a modeling of the impact parameter dependent dipole - proton cross section .",
    "good description of both the dis and exclusive vm production hera data was achieved .",
    "it allows to estimate the impact parameter dependent saturation scale parameter , which found to be less than @xmath127 in the hera kinematic regime . using these results the predictions for exclusive vm and @xmath128 boson production processes at lhc",
    "were given .",
    "k. tuchin presented arguments that saturation effects may be very important for the hard diffractive processes in pa collisions @xcite . in particular , diffractive hard gluon production in onium- nucleus scattering was studied .    the other line of development is related with the @xmath119 channel picture for diffractive processes in perturbative qcd .",
    "its main building block is the reggeized gluon exchange .",
    "two interacting gluons in the color singlet state form the hard pomeron .",
    "it is described by the bfkl equation and is known at present with the next - to - leading @xmath129 accuracy ( nla ) .",
    "the impact factors are the other important ingredients which represent the coupling of the reggeized gluons to the external particles .",
    "it seems to be extremely important to understand the role of subleading energy logarithms in the bfkl approach .",
    "a. papa @xcite considered the forward amplitude for the production of two vm in the collision of two virtual photon , @xmath130 .",
    "this amplitude can be presented in a closed analytical form since the @xmath131 impact factor is known at the nla accuracy .",
    "the sensitivity of the amplitude to the scheme choice , the renormalization and the energy scales was systematically analyzed .",
    "stable results for the amplitude were found applying optimization of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the optimal value of the scales turns out to be much larger than the kinematical one , given by @xmath132 virtuality .",
    "this should be a manifestation of large corrections subleading to nla .",
    "these effects were studied approximately , applying known collinear improvement method to the kernel of bfkl equation .",
    "it is interesting that after collinear improvement the optimal value of the renormalization scales gets much closer to the kinematical one .",
    "this may indicate that collinear improvement method catches the essential sub - nla dynamics .",
    "a excellent probe of the bfkl dynamics may be given by mueller - navelet jets at hadron colliders .",
    "a. sabio - vera presented the analysis for the azimuthal angle decorrelation of the jets and provided estimates for the tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "l. motyka addressed the problem of unitarity corrections for the high energy baryon scattering in perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the consideration is relied on the model for a light cone wave function that encodes the nontrivial baryon quantum numbers .",
    "the impact factors describing the coupling of a baryon to the states of up to four reggeized gluons and their energy evolution are studied .",
    "new structures in the interaction of a baryon with reggeized gluons were found .",
    "it may indicate that the pattern of unitarisation for baryon amplitudes is more complex as compared to scattering of the color dipole .",
