    "entanglement is perhaps the most puzzling feature of quantum mechanics and in the last two decades it became the key resource in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "entangled qubits prepared in pure , maximally entangled states are required by many quantum - information processes . however , in a mundane world , a pure maximally entangled state is an idealization as , e.g. , a plane wave in classical optics .",
    "in fact , interaction of qubits with the environment leads to decoherence that may cause a pure entangled state to become less pure ( mixed ) and less entangled .",
    "thus , any _ realistic _ quantum - communication / computation protocol must cope with entangled mixed states and it is desirable to attain the maximum amount of entanglement for a given degree of mixedness .",
    "states that fulfill this condition are called maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) and , recently , they have been the subject of several papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in this article",
    "we propose a new method to create mems from a pair of photons initially prepared in the singlet polarization state .",
    "kwiat and coworkers @xcite were the first to achieve mems using photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "they induced decoherence in spdc pairs initially prepared in a pure entangled state by coupling polarization and time degrees of freedom of the photons . at the same time , a somewhat different scheme was used by de martini and coworkers @xcite who instead used the spatial degrees of freedom of spdc photons to induce decoherence .",
    "however , both the kwiat and the de martini method require operations on _ both _ photons of the spdc pair . on the contrary",
    ", our technique has the advantage to require only _ local _ operations upon one of the two photons .",
    "this article is structured as follows : in the first part of sec .",
    "ii we show the relation existing between a one - qubit quantum map and a classical - optics setup on the laboratory bench . in the second part of sec .",
    "ii , we exploit this knowledge to design a simple linear - optical set - up to generate mems from a pair of photons via local operations and postselection .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii we provide an experimental demonstration of our method , using entangled photons from parametric down - conversion . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec",
    "we begin by giving a brief description of the connection between classical polarization optics and quantum mechanics of qubits , as recently put forward by several authors @xcite .",
    "most textbooks on classical optics introduce the concept of polarized and unpolarized light with the help of the jones and stokes - mueller calculi , respectively @xcite . in these calculi ,",
    "the description of classical polarization of light is formally identical to the quantum description of pure and mixed states of two - level systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "mathematically speaking , there is an isomorphism between the quantum density matrix @xmath0 describing a qubit and the classical _ coherency matrix _ @xmath1 @xcite describing polarization of a beam of light : @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath1 is an hermitean , positive semidefinite @xmath3 matrix , as is @xmath0 . a classical linear optical process ( as , e.g. , the passage of a beam of light through an optical device ) , can be described by a @xmath4 complex - valued matrix @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , where , from now on , we adopt the convention that summation over repeated latin indices is understood . moreover",
    ", we assume that all latin indices @xmath7 take the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while greek indices @xmath10 take the values @xmath11 . in polarization optics",
    "one usually deals with the real - valued mueller matrix @xmath12 which is connected to @xmath5 via a unitary transformation @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 is often written as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , are known as the _ polarizance vector _ and the _ diattenuation vector _",
    "( superscript @xmath16 indicates transposition ) , respectively . note that @xmath17 is nonzero only for dichroic media , namely media that induce polarization - dependent losses ( pdl ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is a @xmath19 real - valued matrix",
    ". it should be noticed that if we choose @xmath20 ( this can be always done since it amounts to a trivial _ polarization - independent _ renormalization ) , the mueller matrix of a non - dichroic optical element ( @xmath21 ) , is formally identical to a non - unital , trace - preserving , one - qubit quantum map ( also called channel ) @xcite .",
    "if also @xmath22 ( pure depolarizers and pure retarders @xcite ) , then @xmath12 becomes identical to a unital , one - qubit channel @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to show that any linear optical device that can be represented by @xmath5 ( or @xmath12 ) , can also be described by a set of at most four distinct optical elements in parallel as @xmath23 , where the four @xmath3 _ jones _ matrices @xmath24 , represent four different non - depolarizing optical elements and @xmath25 @xcite . from the results above it readily follows that the most general operation that a linear optical element can perform upon a beam of light can be written as @xmath26 . since @xmath25 , the previous equation is formally identical to the kraus form @xcite of a completely positive one - qubit quantum map @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , if a single photon encoding a polarization qubit passes through an optical device classically described by the mueller matrix @xmath28 , its initial state @xmath29 will be transformed according to @xmath30 .    now that we have learned how to associate a quantum map to a set of at most four optical elements , we can apply this knowledge to design a simple optical scheme suitable for mems production .",
    "suppose to have two qubits ( encoded in the polarization degrees of freedom of two spdc photons , say @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , initially prepared in the state @xmath33 .",

    "( [ eq50 ] ) in the two - qubit basis @xmath38 , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath39",
    ". then , from the definition of @xmath5 it easily follows that @xmath40 . by reshuffling @xmath41 ,",
    "this last result can be written in matrix form as @xmath42 which displays the very simple relation existing between the _ classical _ mueller matrix @xmath5 and the _ quantum _ state @xmath41 . via a direct calculation , it is possible to show that if @xmath0 represents two qubits in the singlet state @xmath43 @xcite , then the proportionality symbol in the last equation above can be substituted with the equality symbol : @xmath44 .",
    "note that this pleasant property is true only for the singlet state .",
    "however , if the initial state @xmath0 is different from the singlet one , then @xmath5 must be simply renormalized by imposing @xmath45 .    now , suppose that we have an experimental setup producing pairs of spdc photons in the singlet state @xmath46 , and we want to transform @xmath46 into the target state @xmath47 via a local map @xmath48 .",
    "all we have to do is first to invert the latter equation to obtain @xmath49 and then to decompose @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we get the ( at most four ) jones matrices @xmath52 representing the optical elements necessary to implement the desired transformation .",
    "this is the main theoretical result of this article .",
    "our technique is very straightforward and we shall demonstrate its feasibility later , by applying it to design an optical setup devoted to mems generation .",
    "however , at this moment , some caveats are in order . to make @xmath50 a physically realizable mueller matrix , its associated matrix @xmath53 should be positive semidefinite @xcite .",
    "if this is not the case , then the transformation @xmath54 can not be implemented via local operations .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that if the initial state is a werner state @xmath55 and the target state is the singlet @xmath56 , then such operation ( known as _ concentration _",
    "@xcite ) can not be physically implemented by a local setup since @xmath53 has three degenerate negative eigenvalues .",
    "another caveat comes from the no - signalling constraint .",
    "since @xmath50 describes a local device operating only upon photon @xmath31 , a second observer watching at photon @xmath32 can not distinguish the initial state @xmath46 from the transformed state @xmath47 , that is : @xmath57 .",
    "this condition requires the one - qubit map @xmath58 to be trace - preserving : @xmath59 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) , a straightforward calculation shows that such condition can not be fulfilled if @xmath60 , that is if the device implementing @xmath58 contains dichroic ( or pdl ) elements .",
    "pdl is important in many commonly used optical devices as polarizers , circulators , isolators , etc .",
    ", @xcite . within the framework of quantum information theory , all these _ physical _ devices",
    "may be represented by `` _",
    "_ unphysical _ _ '' one - qubit maps @xmath58 that violate the no - signalling condition .",
    "this apparent paradox disappears if one allows causal classical communications between observers who actually measure and reconstruct the target state @xmath47 generated by the `` unphysical '' local map @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in coincidence measurements ( required to reconstruct @xmath47 ) , classical ( as opposed to quantum ) signalling between the two observers is necessary to allow them to compare their own experimental results and select from the raw data the coincidence counts . in other words , a coincidence measurement post - selects only those photons that have not been absorbed by the pdl element @xcite .",

    "detectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 perform coincidence measurements . ]    with these caveats in mind , we come to the experimental validation of our method .",
    "we choose to generate mems i states @xcite , represented by the density matrix @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , the entanglement and mixedness of the state @xmath66 change . here",

    "our experimental set - up is shown in fig.1 .",

    "are used as spatial filters to assure that the initial two - photon state is in a single transverse mode .",
    "spurious birefringence along the fibers is compensated by suitably oriented polarization controllers ( ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , total retardation introduced by the fibers and walk - off effects at the crystal are compensated by compensating crystals (: 0.5-mm thick crystals ) and half - wave plates ( @xmath80 ) in both photonic paths . in this way",
    "the initial two - photon state is prepared in the polarization singlet state @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are labels for horizontal and vertical polarizations of the two photons , respectively . in the second part of the experimental set - up ( ) the _ two - term _ decomposition of @xmath50",
    "is physically realized by a _ two - path _ optical device .",
    "a photon enters such a device through a @xmath84 beam splitter ( ) and can be either transmitted to path @xmath9 or reflected to path @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath9 a neutral - density filter ( @xmath86 ) is followed by a linear polarizer ( ) oriented horizontally ( with respect to the crystal basis ) .",

    "additionally , interference filters ( ) in front of each detector ( @xmath95 nm ) provide for bandwidth selection .",

    "experimental points with @xmath106 ( @xmath98 ) are obtained by varying the neutral - density filters @xmath107 in such a way that @xmath108 ; while points with @xmath109 are achieved for @xmath110 .",
    "note that the latter points do not represent memss , but different mixed entangled states whose density matrix is still given by @xmath66 but with the parameter @xmath103 now varying as @xmath111 .",
    "the average fidelity between the measured states @xmath98 an the `` target '' states @xmath97 , is given by @xmath112 .",
    "the main reason for its deviation from @xmath113 , is due to spurious , uncontrolled birefringence in the and the prism composing the set - up . to verify this , first we calculated the fidelity between the states @xmath114 ( obtained by applying the theoretically determined map @xmath115 to the experimentally prepared initial singlet state @xmath100 ) , with the theoretical mems @xmath116 .",

    "second , we explicitly measured the mueller matrices for both the and the prism ( matrices that would be equal to the identity for ideal non - birefringent elements ) and we actually found spurious birefringence . from such measured matrices it was possible to determine the unwanted local unitary operation induced by these optical elements @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that such operation does not change the position of our experimental points in the linear entropy - tangle plane .",
    "now , if one applies this unitary operation to our raw data and calculates once again the average fidelity , the result would be @xmath120 .",
    "however , since this `` compensation '' of the spurious birefringence is performed upon the measured data and not directly on the physical setup , we felt that it was more fair to present the uncorrected data .",
    "in conclusion , we have theoretically proposed and experimentally tested a new , simple method to create mems i states of photons .",

    "this task could appear , at first sight , impossible since it was recently demonstrated @xcite that even the most general local operation can not generate mems because this would violate relativistic causality .",
    "however , as we discussed in the text , our results do not contradict ref .",
    "@xcite since we obtained them via postselection operated by coincidence measurements .",
    "the latter are possible only when causal classical communication between detectors is permitted .",
    "still , the connection between relativistic causality , dichroic ( or , pdl ) devices and postselection , is far from being trivial .",
    "for example , suppose that a two - photon state is produced by an optical setup containing _ local _ pdl elements , and that we tomographically reconstruct it after coincidence measurements .",
    "such a reconstructed state will correctly describe the result of any other measurement involving coincidence measurements ( as , e.g. , bell measurements ) , but it will _ fail _ when describing the result of any single - photon measurement .",
    "we stress that this limitation is _ not _ inherent to our scheme , but it is shared by all optical set - ups containing pdl elements ."
