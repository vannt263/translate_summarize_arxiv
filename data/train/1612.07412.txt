    "single solid - state quantum emitters such as color centers in crystals and epitaxial quantum dots ( qds ) are being explored for a variety of purposes in photonic quantum information technology , such as triggered single photon generation .",
    "although some techniques exist for the precise location of these emitters at the stage of their formation , such as site - controlled qd growth  @xcite or implantation through nanoapertures  @xcite , much work continues to be focused on randomly positioned structures , such as naturally occurring impurity centers or self - assembled qds . in part , this is due to the optical quality of such structures .",
    "for example , qds produced by stranski - krastanov self - assembled growth  @xcite have been used in single - photon sources exhibiting essentially transform - limited emission linewidths  @xcite , which has not yet been shown for site - controlled qds . as a result ,",
    "methods to locate the spatial position of quantum emitters with respect to alignment features become necessary in order to fabricate nanophotonic structures , such as gratings , waveguides , and microcavities  @xcite , in which the quantum emitters are optimally aligned with respect to the confined optical modes . in such devices , offsets in the position of the quantum emitters of @xmath4  50  nm can result in a significant degradation in performance .    of the various techniques used to locate single quantum emitters such as qds , including atomic force microscopy  @xcite , scanning confocal microscopy  @xcite , scanning electron microscopy  @xcite , and cathodoluminescence  @xcite , photoluminescence imaging  @xcite is particularly appealing due to the ability to use wide - field illumination and multiplexed detection on a sensitive camera to interrogate a large sample area in a relatively small amount of time . in ref .  , we reported on the development of a photoluminescence imaging technique for locating single qds with an uncertainty of @xmath5  nm with respect to metallic alignment features ( @xmath6  nm when using a solid immersion lens ) , and demonstrated how this approach could be used in the creation of bright and pure triggered single - photon sources . here",
    ", we describe the performance of a second - generation setup that significantly improves upon our previous work in several ways . by working with a high numerical aperture objective housed within the closed - cycle cryostat used to interrogate the devices , we improve the collected photon flux , eliminate imaging distortion due to the cryostat windows , and ensure common mode vibration between the sample and objective .",
    "we use a more sophisticated and automated data analysis method for determining the qd position , consisting of a maximum likelihood estimate  @xcite and cross - correlation approach  @xcite to localize the qd and alignment marks , respectively . taken together , these improvements result in a that is mean positioning uncertainty ( one standard deviation value ) @xmath3  nm for an image acquisition time of 1  s , which represents more than a factor of 6@xmath0 improvement in uncertainty and 100@xmath0 reduction in acquisition time in comparison to our previous work .",
    "we interrogate samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy and consisting of a layer of low - density inas qds embedded at the midpoint of a gaas layer ( typically 190  nm thick ) , which in turn is grown on a @xmath7  @xmath2 m al@xmath8ga@xmath9as layer ( used as a sacrificial layer in the fabrication of suspended devices like photonic crystal membranes ) .",
    "we fabricate an array of alignment marks ( typically crosses with a separation of 50  @xmath2 m ) on top of the samples through electron - beam lithography , cr / au deposition , and resist lift - off .",
    "the samples are placed in a closed - cycle cryostat with top optical access and cooled to a temperature below 10  k. the cryostat also houses within it a 100@xmath0 magnification , 0.9 numerical aperture ( na ) objective lens that sits above the top of the radiation shield and below the top window that maintains the cryostat vacuum with respect to the lab environment .    -@xmath10-@xmath11 positioning stack within a 4  k closed - cycle cryostat .",
    "hanging above the sample , within the cryostat , is a 100@xmath0 magnification , 0.9 na microscope objective .",
    "two different color leds are combined on a 50:50 beamsplitter and sent into the objective in order to excite the quantum dots ( qds ) and illuminate the sample , respectively .",
    "the qd excitation led is typically chosen as 630  nm , while the illumination led depends on the specifics of the material epitaxy , in particular , the underlying layers , and is at 940  nm .",
    "emitted light from the qds and reflected light from the sample are either directed through one or more long pass filter ( lpfs ) to reject the quantum dot excitation light and wetting layer emission before going into a tube lens and an emccd camera , or are coupled into a single mode fiber and sent to a grating spectrometer for spectral analysis . in addition , a tunable wavelength , continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser is coupled into the system from single mode fiber through an 8:92 beamsplitter , to enable excitation of a small number of qds within a focused laser spot .",
    "( b ) representative image acquired by the emccd camera in a 1  s integration time .",
    "( c ) representative photoluminescence spectrum from a single qd . ]",
    "our positioning approach is based on wide - field imaging in which two led sources are used , one for excitation of the qds and the other for illumination of the sample ( see fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the light emitted by two leds is combined on a 50:50 beamsplitter and sent through two additional beamsplitters above the cryostat ( 30:70 and 50:50 ) before reaching the cryostat objective .",
    "the light emitted from the semiconductor material and reflected off its top surface consists of many different colors , namely reflected qd excitation light ( 630  nm ) , qd emission ( 900  nm to 950  nm range ) , emission from other recombination centers in the material ( typically < 860  nm , and originating from the gaas band edge , carbon acceptor states , and wetting layer states ) , and reflected illumination ( typically 940  nm ) .",
    "the 50:50 beamsplitter above the cryostat sends the reflected and emitted light towards an emccd ( electron multiplying charge coupled device ) camera in the reflected path , and through the 30:70 beamsplitter and an 8:92 beamsplitter in the transmitted path . by placing appropriate filters ( notch filters and/or edge - pass filters ) in front of the emccd camera to eliminate all light other than emission from the qd states and the reflected illumination , we obtain images such as those shown in fig .  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the emccd camera chip is 1004 pixels  @xmath0  1002 pixels , with each pixel having dimensions of 8  @xmath2 m  @xmath0  8  @xmath2 m .",
    "the 8:92 beamsplitter allows for introduction of pump light from a continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser and for collection of light emitted from the sample into a single mode fiber , where it can be sent to a grating spectrometer for spectral analysis . the focused pump spot from the ti : sapphire laser is @xmath12  @xmath2 m in diameter , and allows for selection of individual qds from within the 66  @xmath2 m  @xmath0  66  @xmath2 m field of view provided by the imaging system ( the tube lens focal length of 200  mm is larger than the nominal 165  mm for the 100@xmath0 infinity - corrected objective , resulting in an additional magnification of 1.2@xmath0 before the emcdd ) .",
    "an example photoluminescence spectrum from an individual qd is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "the system is constructed using cage - mounted commercial optical and optomechanical components , with the exception of a central aluminum block ( not shown ) that provides structural rigidity .",
    "the use of an objective within the cryostat provides several advantages and tradeoffs in comparison to setups in which the objective is held outside of the cryostat , as in ref .  ,",
    "in which a long working distance 20@xmath0 objective ( 0.4 na ) was used .",
    "the geometry of the cryostat is such that the vibrations induced by the cryocooler , which in our case is based on a gifford - mcmahon architecture , are common to both the objective and the sample .",
    "the ability to place the objective in close proximity to the sample allows for the use of a high na ( 0.9 ) , which both increases the solid angle over which emitted photons are collected , and also increases the led intensity at the sample , ensuring that saturation of all qds within the field of view can be achieved ( this was not the case in ref .  ) .",
    "the net result is to increase the collected photon flux from the qd , thereby reducing the camera gain ( no em gain is needed ) and generally improving the measurement dynamic range and signal - to - noise ratio , and reducing the required image acquisition time .",
    "finally , the absence of optical windows between the objective and the sample leads to higher quality imaging ( for example , alignment features appear sharper ) , as we discuss below . on the other hand , the larger magnification , combined with the fixed size of the emccd camera chip , results in a smaller field of view , and the limited translation range of the nanopositioners within the cryostat limits the sample area that can be covered in comparison to the previous work , where the entire microscope system could be moved independently from the sample and cryostat .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents a comparison of the results from the imaging setup described in ref .",
    "( first generation setup ) and the new system ( second generation setup ) , where the samples investigated emit in the 930  nm wavelength band .",
    "the modified system results in several readily observable differences in the collected images .",
    "first , the alignment marks in the image from the second generation setup ( fig .  [ fig2](b ) ) are noticeably sharper than those from the first generation setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) , a result of both the higher resolution of the imaging system and more importantly , the absence of image - distorting optical windows between the objective and the sample .",
    "this is seen quite clearly when considering line scans across an alignment mark ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](e)-(f ) ) , where the blurring produced by the windows results in an essentially gaussian shape for the line scan in the first generation setup , while the line scan for the second generation setup , though not perfectly rectangular , show much more abrupt edges . the higher spatial resolution provided by the larger magnification ( increased from a 40@xmath0 system magnification to a 100@xmath13 system magnification )",
    "results in the full - width at half - maximum of the qd emission being reduced from @xmath14  2  @xmath2 m to @xmath14  650  nm , which can be important in order to clearly distinguish between qds when working with higher qd density samples .",
    "the improved signal - to - noise level that results from increased collected photon flux results in significantly reduced fit uncertainties in the center positions of the qd emission and alignment marks ( the specific procedures used are detailed in section  [ sec : analysis_methods ] ) , and moreover , the acquisition time required to achieve such uncertainties is only 1  s , in comparison to 120  s for the first generation setup .",
    "this reduction significantly increases the throughput , limits the potential influence of drift during the measurements , and stands in contrast to serial detection techniques , such as scanning confocal microscopy , which require a similar integration time ( assuming equal collection efficiency ) for each pixel in the image  @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "in summary , we have presented an improved implementation of the two - color photoluminescence imaging approach used in ref .   to locate the position of single self - assembled qds with respect to alignment marks for subsequent fabrication with single qds optimally aligned within nanophotonic devices .",
    "our new approach reduces the uncertainties in the qd positions by a factor of 6 , and the image acquisition time needed to achieve those uncertainties by a factor of 100 , yielding a mean one standard deviation uncertainty in the qd location of 4.5  nm . the superior optical performance and more sophisticated and automated image analysis tools",
    "have greatly increased the throughput of this technique . as a result",
    "we believe that it will be valuable in future demonstrations of qd - based devices for integrated quantum photonics  @xcite . in the future , a combination of automated sample positioning , focus adjustment ( through the sample height ) , and stage encoder readout may enable stitching of multiple fields together , further increasing the throughput and capability of the system . moreover , we anticipate that this technique can be easily extended to study other solid - state quantum emitters , including in emerging systems such as sic  @xcite or two - dimensional semiconductors  @xcite .",
