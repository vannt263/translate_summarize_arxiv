    "color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are the striking non - perturbative phenomena in low - energy qcd , which are of particular importance in particle and nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "several scenarios of the confinement mechanism have been proposed  @xcite , where the ghost and gluon propagators in deep infrared need to be quantified , thus this requires a non - perturbative quantization of qcd .",
    "whereas this issue has been investigated extensively , it remains challenging to comprehend the non - perturbative aspects from the first - principle calculations .    in a pure su(3 ) gauge theory , the polyakov loop is an exact order parameter of the @xmath0 center symmetry and for deconfinement , which dictates a first order phase transition  @xcite . in the presence of light dynamical quarks ,",
    "the polyakov loop loses its interpretation as an order parameter and is smoothly changing with temperature .",
    "contrary to the broad polyakov loop , a particular ratio of the polyakov loop susceptibilities retain a clear remnant of the underlying @xmath0 center symmetry fairly well even in full qcd with the physical pion mass  @xcite .",
    "thus , the ratio of the polyakov loop fluctuations can serve as observables to identify the onset of deconfinement in qcd .    in the presence of light dynamical quarks , the transition from hadronic phase to quark - gluon plasma becomes crossover and accompanies partial restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is characterized by a non - vanishing condensation of quark - bilinear operators .",
    "the low - lying dirac modes , which are the eigenmodes of the dirac operator with small eigenvalues , are known to be responsible for saturating the chiral condensate of light quarks @xmath1 , through the banks - casher relation  @xcite",
    ".    in fact , at vanishing and small baryon chemical potential , the lattice qcd results suggest that there is an interplay between quark deconfinement and chiral crossovers as they take place in the same narrow temperature range  @xcite .",
    "also , in the maximally abelian gauge , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , as well as the instantons , simultaneously disappear when the qcd monopoles are removed  @xcite . on the other hand , there exist several observations that unbroken chiral symmetry does not dictate deconfinement : given a tower of hadron spectra with eliminating the low - lying dirac modes  @xcite , the hadrons keep their identity even in chirally restored phase where parity doublers are all degenerate .",
    "in addition , it has been shown in the su(3 ) lattice simulations that the low - lying modes have little contribution to the polyakov loop and to the confining force , indicating that the two features are rather independent  @xcite .    in the context of the interplay between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite",
    ", it is important to make a reliable separation of one from another , whereas those phenomena are supposed to be correlated .",
    "the apparent coincidence in change of properties of the polyakov loop fluctuation ratios and the chiral condensate and its susceptibility near the chiral crossover might indicate that there is a tied relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "however , such a possible relation has not been quantified yet .    utilizing the dirac - mode expansion method formulated on the lattice  @xcite ,",
    "the low - lying modes can be systematically removed in calculating expectation values of different operators .    in this paper , we apply the above expansion method to investigate the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in terms of the polyakov loop fluctuations and their ratios .",
    "we put our particular attention to the contribution of the low - lying dirac modes to the polyakov loop fluctuations .",
    "we derive the analytic relations between the real , imaginary and modulus of the polyakov loop and their fluctuations with the dirac modes on the temporally odd - number size lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these analytical relations are applicable to both full and quenched qcd .",
    "we show , through numerical simulations on the lattice in quenched qcd , that the low - lying dirac modes yield negligible contribution to the polyakov loop fluctuations . with these results ,",
    "also not observed is a direct relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd through the polyakov loop fluctuation ratios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we derive a set of analytic relations linking the polyakov loop fluctuations to the dirac eigenmodes . in sec .",
    "iii , we examine the role of the low - lying dirac modes in the polyakov loop fluctuations and present our numerical results within quenched lattice qcd .",

    "in addition , the derived analytic relations connecting the polyakov loop and dirac modes are mathematically exact for arbitrary odd temporal size @xmath55 .",
    "thus we expect that our conclusion is rather robust in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ambiguity of the multiplicative renormalization of the polyakov loop has been avoided in the ratio of the polyakov loop susceptibilities .",
    "yet , it is left as an important but difficult task to extrapolate these analytic relations to the continuum .",
    "in addition to the polyakov loop fluctuations , there are further observables which are linked to deconfinement properties in qcd and show abrupt , but smooth change across the chiral crossover .",
    "one of such observables is the kurtosis of the net - quark number fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "besides , the qcd monopole , in the maximally abelian gauge , is a relevant degree of freedom in the low - energy qcd  @xcite , and plays a fundamental role for non - perturbative phenomena such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , from the future perspectives , it would be of particular interest to investigate such quantities in terms of the dirac - mode expansion and to explore the influence of the low lying eigenmodes on their properties near the chiral crossover .",
