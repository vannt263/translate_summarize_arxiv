    "in the present article we analyze two methods to effectively incorporate electrostatics in symmetric disc - shaped molecules via an angle and temperature dependent coarse - grained potential .",
    "the general purpose is to provide an approach that is appropriate to describe not only fluid phases , but also stable crystalline phases for these molecules .",
    "our work builds upon a previous investigation  @xcite providing a general coarse - grained methodology for uniaxial discotics . in the present work ,",
    "we show that the relevant electrostatics can be treated separately from the remaining interactions via a direct sum . in the literature",
    "there are many different approaches to create coarse - grained molecular models for pair interactions of discotics with electrostatics based on a gay - berne model  @xcite or different interaction potentials .",
    "@xcite the simplest approach involves only one interaction site that inherits no orientational degree of freedom located at the molecules center - of - mass . for fluid phases at low densities , this kind of representation might indeed be sufficient , at least for molecules without complex internal structure .",
    "@xcite however , when considering systems at higher densities , the specific atomistic structure of the molecules yielding various degrees freedom becomes more and more important .",
    "more specifically , at the other end of coarse - graining ( before using pure quantum mechanics ) are the atomistically - resolved models .",
    "atomistic model studies for discotics have been proposed e.g. for coronene ,  @xcite benzene  @xcite or hexabenzororonene derivatives .",
    "@xcite in our investigation we make a compromise between both levels of detail .",
    "a molecular orientation vector ( uniaxial ) or tensor ( biaxial particle ) is a frequently used example to account for orientational internal degrees of freedom .",
    "such an approach also allows to model anisotropic shape .",
    "corresponding examples are the gaussian - overlap  @xcite or the gay - berne potential  @xcite as well as their derivatives .",
    "@xcite even more complexity can be reached by considering many ( instead of one central ) interaction sites .",
    "@xcite further , the treatment of electrostatics can be realized through an electric multipole attached to the interaction site in a centered  @xcite or off - centered  @xcite arrangement .",
    "moreover , by optimizing the arrangement of different electric multipoles per interaction site  @xcite one comes to more and more realistic models .",
    "@xcite a quite popular coarse - graining strategy is given by the martini force - field  @xcite which is not based on atoms but on chemical building blocks",
    ".    here we rather aim at developing a model which has as few degrees of freedom as possible , while still conserving the uniaxiality and head - to - tail symmetry of typical disc - shaped molecules .    throughout the entire analysis , we focus on coronene molecules ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cor ] ) , for which we already developed an angle- and temperature dependent model for the van der waals part with desired symmetries .",

    "various studies suggest a broad range of applications for coronene , which are outlined in the following .",
    "it can be used as a building block for graphene nanoribbons ,  @xcite as a candidate for active layer compounds in photovoltaic applications  @xcite and its derivatives  @xcite can also be used in liquid crystal displays .",
    "@xcite understanding coronene pair interactions gives further insight to graphene stacking  @xcite and growth of graphene .",
    "@xcite even more , the crystal structure gives a relation to electronic properties , like band gaps .",
    "@xcite    we now turn to the modeling approach for coronene .",
    "the angle- and temperature - dependent van der waals model ,  @xcite on which our investigation is based on , stems from a coarse - graining procedure that uses atomistic trajectory data from two - molecule simulations ( modeled with the generalized amber force - field ( gaff )  @xcite ) .",
    "this force - field was already successfully used in growth studies of another conjugated organic molecule , that is , para - sexyphenyl .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the force field yields the correct phase behavior ( for a more detailed discussion of the validation of the amber force - field for aromatics , see olivier et al .",
    "other coarse - grained potentials developed in the literature  @xcite do not take into account the full angle- and temperature dependence .",
    "in principle , the kind of coarse - graining method used in ref .   could be applied to molecules with electrostatic contributions , when ab - initio simulations are used . however , ab initio simulations are from a computational prospective very time consuming compared to atomistically - detailed simulations . a common compromise",
    "consists in using static partial charges distributed among the atoms of the underlying microscopic model in the coarse - graining procedure .",
    "@xcite by implication , as shown in previous studies involving quantum - chemical calculations ,  @xcite it is generally not sufficient to use the static atomic partial charges characterizing an isolated dimer ( except for selected configurations such as a parallel displaced one  @xcite ) .",
    "however , for static partial charges an angle and temperature dependent coarse - grained pair potential for perylene , a flat but non - discotic molecule , was already developed by babadi et al .  @xcite using constrained steered dynamics for specific configurations desired to fit an ellipsoidal soft - potential .",
    "@xcite they also present a non - temperature dependent and biaxial model for coronene which implicitly involves static partial charges .",
    "an elegant approach for the electrostatics in coronene is presented by obolensky et al .",
    "@xcite they propose a uniaxial model for coronene consisting of concentric charged rings .",
    "unfortunately , this model is not temperature dependent , it is based on static partial charges and the evaluation of the interaction potential is quite involved due to numerical integrations for each pair interaction , inconvenient for many - particle simulations .",
    "nonetheless , we also consider this electrostatic contribution , which already has the desired symmetries , namely uniaxiality and head - to - tail symmetry",
    ".    in particular , the raw model for our investigations is an additive combination of the temperature - dependent van der waals potential from ref .   and a coarse - grained electrostatic potential .",
    "the entire temperature dependence stems from the van der waals part alone .",
    "the model thus implies that the impact of slight changes in the charge distribution on the interatomic forces is small against the van der waals forces which dominate at short length scales .",
    "if these temperature effects on the charge distribution are not important , we can focus on ground state charge distributions with the desired symmetry .",
    "we introduce two different approaches to include the electrostatics in a simple model .",
    "the first approach uses the van der waals model and considers electrostatic interactions via a linear point quadrupole at the molecular center along the symmetry axis .",
    "this kind of approach was already applied for coronene  @xcite where an unusual strong repulsion for planar configurations was observed .",
    "we address this issue in more detail later in our work .",
    "nonetheless , this approach was successfully applied to benzene molecules  @xcite in the liquid phase with an additional dampening field for closed distances .",
    "similar ideas are also used to model the interaction of clay particles ,  @xcite which exhibit an electric double layer .    in the second approach ,",
    "we include the pure ring electrostatics , suggested by obolensky et al ,  @xcite implicitly in our van der waals model .",
    "we deliberately do not use any kind of point charge electrostatic implementations in the models since point charge patterns overestimate the charge localization , are long - ranged and do not fulfill our symmetry requirements .    both of the present approaches allow a better representation of the @xmath0 stacking  @xcite which is also observed in similar aromatic molecules , e.g. benzene dimers  @xcite and hexabenzocoronene crystals .",

    ", our multipole decomposition of the electrostatic potential consists of a quadrupole moment ( @xmath39 ) and higher multipoles with @xmath40 .    for molecules with continuous axial symmetry , we would only have to consider multipole moments with @xmath41 .",
    "however , the underlying atomistic model of coronene ( see fig .  [",

    "nonetheless , the sixfold symmetry suggests that the linear quadrupole moment ( @xmath42 ) is the only non - zero quadrupole moment .",

    "<S> in this article we present and compare two different , coarse - grained approaches to model electrostatic interactions of disc - shaped aromatic molecules , specifically coronene . </S>",

    "<S> phys . * 141 * , 214110 ( 2014 ) ] where we proposed , based on a systematic coarse - graining procedure starting from the atomistic level , an anisotropic effective ( gay - berne - like ) potential capable of describing van - der - waals contributions to the interaction energy . to take into account electrostatics , we introduce , first , a linear quadrupole moment along the symmetry axis of the coronene disc . </S>",
    "<S> the second approach takes into account the fact that the partial charges within the molecules are distributed in a ring - like fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we then reparametrize the effective gay - berne - like potential such that it matches , at short distances , the ring - ring potential . to investigate the validity of these two approaches , we perform many - particle molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , focusing on the crystalline phase ( karpatite ) where electrostatic interaction effects are expected to be particularly relevant for the formation of tilted stacked columns . specifically , we investigate various structural parameters as well as the melting transition . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the second approach yields consistent results with those from experiments despite the fact that the underlying potential decays with the wrong distance dependence at large molecule separations . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy can be transferred to a broader class of molecules , such as benzene or hexabenzocoronene . </S>"
