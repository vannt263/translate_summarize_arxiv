    "the purpose of this communication is to overview the results published recently in the physical review e by the krakow - orsay collaboration @xcite and devoted to the geometry of random networks .",
    "the discussion is sketchy and aimed to give the reader only a general idea of what has been achieved .",
    "all the useful details can be found in the original papers .",
    "network study is not our original field of research : we are trying to exploit the experience gained working on a different subject - quantum gravity , or , more precisely , statistical mechanics of random manifolds - in another context and to fill the gap between two communities , that are differently motivated but often confronted to manifestly similar problems .",
    "this is a status report , in the same vein as my talk at the utrecht symposium in 2001 , addressed to a similar audience @xcite .",
    "there are two complementary approaches to random networks , and actually to numerous complex systems : the diachronic and the synchronic one . in the former one",
    "focuses on the time evolution of the system .",
    "it is particularly suitable if the aim is to uncover the evolution dynamics . in",
    "the latter one works at a fixed time , considering an ensemble of related systems , with the aim of finding common structural traits . being primarily interested in the geometry of networks ,",
    "we have adopted the synchronic approach .    the goal is to develop a statistical mechanics of random networks . in the statistical mechanics of gases",
    "one starts with an ideal gas .",
    "analogously , working with uncorrelated nodes is a natural first step in our research . for definiteness",
    ", we consider undirected networks only .",
    "the model is compactly defined by writing the partition function as a formal integral @xmath0 } \\label{1}\\ ] ] the set of `` coupling constants '' @xmath1 is eventually identified with the degree distribution , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are control parameters .",
    "of course , strictly speaking , the integral does not exist . however , the perturbative series in the `` coupling constants '' is well defined and the individual terms can be , as in field theory , represented by feynman diagrams . the idea is to identify the labeled feynman diagrams of the minifield theory defined by ( [ 1 ] ) with the graphs representing the network and to attach to every such graph a weight equal to the corresponding feynman amplitude .",
    "all this is explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider the ensemble where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the number of nodes and links , respectively , are fixed .",
    "using the feynman rules one finds that the weight @xmath6 of a labeled non - degenerate graph - one without tadpoles and multiple connections between nodes - is up to an irrelevant factor given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the degree of the @xmath9-th node .",
    "this graph is , in general , not connected .",
    "it follows from the obvious identity @xmath10 that , at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 , all non - degenerate graphs are equiprobable when @xmath1 has the poisson form @xmath11 , with some constant @xmath12 .",
    "hence , in this case graphs are those of the classical erds - renyi theory @xcite . in general , the statistical ensemble discussed in this section is a generalization of the classical ensemble of random graphs to allow for an arbitrary degree distribution ( see later ) .",
    "notice , that , because of ( [ 2bis ] ) , the relative weights of microstates are invariant under the transformation @xmath13 .",
    "we shall see later that the ambiguity is lifted when one fixes the ratio @xmath14 .      in the `` quasi - classical '' limit",
    "@xmath15 only connected tree graphs contribute to @xmath16 .",
    "the integral in ( [ 1 ] ) can be calculated using the saddle - point approximation .",
    "the saddle - point condition reads @xmath17 and one easily checks that @xmath18 , which means that @xmath19 generates tree graphs with one external node marked .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can be exactly solved by lagrange inversion , it is sufficient to use a more direct approach @xcite : eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can only be satisfied when @xmath3 is smaller than some critical value @xmath20 .",
    "hence @xmath19 is a singular function of @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , only the singular part of @xmath19 is of real physical interest , since it determines the behavior of arbitrarily large trees . and this singular part is readily found directly from ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the result is used to determine the distribution of the smallest distance between pairs of nodes , the hausdorff and spectral dimensions , etc .",
    "all this is discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , among others , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are extended to the interesting case of scale - free graphs .",
    "i shall not enter into more details here .",
    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) gives a weight to each microstate .",
    "for given @xmath14 , this , in essence , defines the statistical ensemble .",
    "however , in order to make this definition being of any use , we supplement it with an explicit recipe enabling one to construct graphs , on a computer . to this end",
    "we define a local _ move _ transforming one graph into another .",
    "a succession of such moves is a markov process .",
    "the initial state of the system is rapidly forgotten and graphs are sampled with relative frequency given by ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the whole procedure is a specific application of the so - called metropolis method , widely used in other branches of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "one move consists of three steps . in ref .",
    "] first , we sample two distinct nodes , say @xmath9 and @xmath22 .",
    "second , we pick one neighbor of @xmath9 , say @xmath23 .",
    "third , we rewire @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 it is evident , that as far as the modifications of node degrees are concerned , the algorithm is identical to that defining the so called balls - in - boxes model @xcite , defined by the partition function @xmath26 and descibing @xmath27 balls distributed with probability @xmath28 among @xmath4 boxes ( in out case @xmath29 ) .",
    "the constraint represented by the kronecker delta is in the limit @xmath30 satisfied `` for free '' by virtue of the law of large numbers provided @xmath31 .",
    "when the last condition is met , the occupation number of one box @xmath32 when @xmath30 .",
    "the isomorphy of the graph and balls - in - boxes model implies that the degree distribution in the graph model tends asymptotically to @xmath1 provided @xmath33 although the relative weigths of microstates are invariant under the transformation @xmath13 , @xmath34 is not . hence , the ratio @xmath14 is fixed , once one has decided that the degree distribution should be @xmath1 .",
    "there is a problem , however .",
    "graphs generated by the above described algorithm are , in general , degenerate ( as are the objects constructed in the well - known paper by molloy and reed @xcite ; these construction is often misused in the physics literature as a method of generating graphs , without due attention to the degeneracy problem ) .",
    "our algorithm is local .",
    "the creation of degeneracies is therefore easily forbidden : it suffices to check that @xmath23 and @xmath22 are neither identical nor connected .",
    "but this check introduces a bias .",
    "the point is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the use of the metropolis method guarantees that the degree distribution approaches @xmath1 for large @xmath4 , provided one has enough statistics , when @xmath35 , even if one forbids degeneracies .",
    "however , this condition is not satisfied when @xmath1 has a fat tail",
    ". then , there are large fluctuations in the tail and introducing a constraint can bias the sample .",
    "assume that @xmath36 at large @xmath37 .",
    "at finite @xmath4 the tail of @xmath1 can not extend to infinity , because there exists some @xmath38 such that the expected number of nodes with degrees @xmath39 is less than unity . neglecting all correlations",
    "one easily finds the scaling law @xmath40 it is easily seen that @xmath41 can actually be very small well below this natural cut - off .",
    "the bias associated with rejecting degeneracies can be evaluated @xcite .",
    "consider the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath42 : the elements of say the @xmath43-th row sum up to @xmath37 , the degree of the @xmath43-th node .",
    "these elements equal either 0 or 1 when the graph is non - degenerate , they are just positive integers when the graph is degenerate .",
    "we wish to compare the number of ways the @xmath43-th node can be connected to @xmath37 other nodes , when one accepts or rejects degeneracies .",
    "the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to place @xmath37 balls in @xmath44 boxes , but is not altogether trivial , since one has to take into account the symmetry factors that appear in the weights of the degenerate graphs as well as the shape of the degree distribution .",
    "the result at large @xmath4 is @xmath45 \\label{7}\\ ] ] notice , that although @xmath46 is always small , @xmath47 may be large .",
    "we observe , that at fixed @xmath37 the rejection of degeneraties does not introduce any bias at asymptotic @xmath4 .",
    "however , at large @xmath37 the rejection of degeneracies introduces a non - uniform deformation of the spectrum .",
    "actually , there is a cut - off scaling like @xmath48 .",
    "this cut - off is smaller that the `` natural '' cut - off given by ( [ 6 ] ) when @xmath49 . and",
    "this is not a marginal case .",
    "the @xmath50 exponent is like that for most interesting networks !",
    "apparently , forbidding degeneracies introduces a kind of `` kinematic '' correlation at finite @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to stress that this is a property of the model , not a deficiency of the algorithm .",
    "let us also mention , that the conclusions of the above heuristic argument are confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "there is a mathematical conclusion of the above discussion : the alorithm is fine . to my knowledge",
    "this is the only efficient algorithm generating non - degenerate graphs with a given degree distribution .",
    "there are also physical conclusions : independently of any specific model , inter - node correlations are necessarily present in observed scale - free networks , where the tail of the degree distribution manifestly extends beyond a cut - off scaling like @xmath48 . also , the thermodynamical limit can be rather tricky for scale - free networks .",
    "i would like to mention a very nice result obtained by fronczak _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they have calculated analytically the average internode distance in graphs with uncorrelated nodes : @xmath51 this formula has been proposed earlier , by other groups , but the derivation has never been satisfactory , in my opinion .",
    "the problem is that the average shortest path has to grow like a power of @xmath4 for a generic tree with uncorrelated nodes @xcite .",
    "thus , a derivation leading to the logarithmic behavior must use arguments that do not work for trees .",
    "this condition is satisfied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but not in earlier publications claiming the same result .",
    "notice that the coefficient in front of @xmath52 diverges at the percolation threshold , when @xmath53 ( the celebrated reference @xcite ) , at the transition to the regime dominated by trees .",
    "another set of related and interesting results is presented in ref .",
    "these authors have calculated , among others , the distribution of connected components and found the size of the percolation cluster above the percolation threshold .",
    "they have also calculated the conditional degree distribution of nodes belonging to the percolation cluster .",
    "there are many other results of the classical theory that could be extended to graphs with a given degree distribution . indeed , a comprehensive discussion of the classical theory is a subject of a fat book @xcite .",
    "but , we feel we have understood some of the most salient features of the model without correlations .",
    "also , we have a numerical control of the model .",
    "hence , we are eager to move to the next item on our agenda , the problem of correlations .",
    "a comprehensive theory of correlation in networks does not exist .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the model of the preceding section , introducing pairwise correlations between degrees of neighbor nodes .",
    "specific proposals to this effect have been made , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , it seems to me , that correlations of a different nature are particularly important from the phenomenology point of view :    - correlations induced by the growth dynamics .",
    "- clustering , the fact that neighbors of a randomly chosen node are directly linked to each other more frequently than by chance .",
    "a work on clustering is in progress , but we do not have yet results significant enough to be presented here .",
    "let me only mention that we are dealing with a very specific class of matrix models .",
    "on the other hand , we have developed a synchronic approach to growth processes , which is i believe worth mentioning :    we focus our attention on trees , actually on labeled rooted trees , in order to be able to proceed analytically .",
    "we consider a static ensemble , but assume that the networks are endowed with a causal structure .",
    "we say a tree is endowed with a causal structure when the labels always appear in growing numerical order as one moves along the tree from the root towards an arbitrary node .",
    "one can imagine that these labels refer to the time of node formation .",
    "the approach is complementary to the more standard diachronic one .",
    "it turns out that the presence of a causal structure generates internode correlations , once one has summed over all possible labelings .",
    "it is , therefore , of interest to consider models where these specific correlations do not interfere with correlations of a different origin .",
    "hence , we assume that microstate weights factorize , as in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "i have no place to enter into details , which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the talk by p. bialas @xcite ) .",
    "let me shortly summarize the most significant results :    - some of the most popular growing network models , like barabasi - albert s @xcite , can be reformulated in our static formalism .",
    "the original results are recovered in an elegant fashion .",
    "this shows that the widely accepted distinction between growing and equilibrium networks is not really correct .",
    "the opposition between diachrony and synchrony is to large extent an illusion , except when one is interested is specific phenomena , like aging , intrinsically reflecting the running of time .",
    "- we derive a closed , general formula for the degree distribution .",
    "- we also derive a closed formula for the correlation between the degree of an ancestor and that of its descendent , when they are separated by a geodesic distance @xmath54 .",
    "typically , the average descendent degree falls like @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "manifestly , this implies a long - range correlation .",
    "- we further derive a general formula for the distribution of the shortest paths connecting nodes to the root . using this formula",
    "we show that , generically , the lenght of an average such path grows at most like @xmath52 , in contrast to the uncorrelated trees where the growth is power - like @xcite .",
    "i am tempted to share with you a speculation , which does not rest on any solid basis , but may animate someone s imagination .",
    "most present works on networks can be classified under the following headlines :          what is manifestly missing , as far as i know , is a study of networks whose geometry is interacting with matter living on it ( like in the models of quantum gravity , we have been working on ) .",
    "i am not sure that it would be relevant for the present day phenomenology , although some experts tell me that it might find applications in the theory of traffic and communication .",
    "nevertheless , i believe it would be interesting to develop , at least , some models of that kind .",
    "i am pretty sure they would find applications in the future .",
