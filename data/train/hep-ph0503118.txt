    "thanks to the super - kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite experiments , both solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are convincingly established .",

    "two neutrino mass - squared differences and three lepton mixing angles have been measured or constrained by current neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "a more precise determination of these parameters has to rely on the new generation of accelerator neutrino experiments with very long baselines @xcite , in which leptonic cp violation may also be observed .",
    "the terrestrial matter effects in all long - baseline neutrino experiments must be taken into account , since they can unavoidably modify the genuine behaviors of neutrino oscillations in vacuum .    to formulate the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in matter in the same form as those in vacuum",

    "the latter case is equivalently interesting in phenomenology , because our physical purpose is to determine the fundamental parameters of lepton flavor mixing from the effective ones , whose values can directly be measured from a variety of long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this paper aims to reconstruct the genuine neutrino mixing matrix @xmath3 and its unitarity triangles from possible long - baseline neutrino oscillations with terrestrial matter effects .",
    "our work is remarkably different from the existing ones @xcite in the following aspects :    * we derive a new set of sum rules between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it may perfectly complement the sum rules obtained in ref .",
    "we show that similar results can be achieved in the four - neutrino mixing scheme . *",
    "our sum rules allow us to calculate the moduli of @xmath6 ( for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) in terms of those of @xmath9 .",
    "this approach , which results in some much simpler relations between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , proves to be more useful than that proposed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the sides of three unitarity triangles can also be derived in a similar way .",
    "* we express the neutrino oscillation probabilities in terms of @xmath11 and the matter - corrected jarlskog parameter @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath3 and its unitarity triangles can then be reconstructed from possible long - baseline neutrino oscillations straightforwardly and parametrization - independently .",
    "the only assumption to be made is a constant earth density profile .",
    "such an assumption is rather reasonable and close to reality for most of the presently - proposed terrestrial long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , in which the neutrino beam is not expected to go through the earth s core .",

    "we illustrate the dependence of different oscillation terms on the neutrino beam energy and the baseline length .",
    "section v is devoted to a brief summary of our main results .",
    "in the basis where the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates , the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath3 is defined to link the neutrino mass eigenstates ( @xmath15 ) to the neutrino flavor eigenstates ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 a similar definition can be made for @xmath1 , the effective counterpart of @xmath3 in matter .",
    "the strength of cp violation in normal neutrino oscillations is measured by a rephasing - invariant quantity @xmath18 ( in vacuum ) or @xmath12 ( in matter ) , the so - called jarlskog parameter @xcite : @xmath19 where the greek subscripts @xmath20 and the latin subscripts @xmath21 run over @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the effective hamiltonian responsible for the propagation of neutrinos in vacuum or in matter can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the neutrino beam energy , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the corresponding genuine and matter - corrected neutrino mass matrices in the chosen flavor basis , @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( for @xmath30 ) stand respectively for the neutrino masses in vacuum and those in matter .",
    "the deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32 results non - trivially from the charged - current contribution to the @xmath33 forward scattering @xcite , when neutrinos travel through a normal material medium like the earth : @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the background density of electrons .",
    "subsequently we assume a constant earth density profile ( i.e. , @xmath36 = constant ) , which is a very good approximation for most of the long - baseline neutrino experiments proposed at present .",
