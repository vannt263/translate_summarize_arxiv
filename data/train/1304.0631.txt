    "topological insulators ( tis ) are a novel class of materials ( see e.g. reviews ) in which the character of electron transport varies from insulating in the interior of the material to metallic near its surface .",

    "this is clearly seen from the asymptotics of eqs.([f^s ] ) and ( [ f^p ] ) at large distances @xmath207 : @xmath208 @xmath209 unlike the @xmath0-wave amplitude ( [ f^s_1 ] ) , the @xmath1-wave one ( [ f^p_1 ] ) is proportional to the third power of the mean - free path @xmath8 in the dirty case @xmath210 .",
    "thus , the main conclusion of this study is that in dirty tis , in which the elastic mean - free path is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length ( @xmath211 ) , the induced superconductivity is predominantly @xmath0-wave like .",
    "the @xmath1-wave component is greatly suppressed compared with the @xmath0-wave one . in cleaner tis the @xmath1-wave amplitude remains always smaller than the @xmath0-wave one , albeit the difference between them may not be so drastic ( see curves b for @xmath212 in figs .",

    "both components should be observable in the presence of a modest amount of impurities .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in this work the tunneling between a superconductor and a ti has been treated as an incoherent process in which the electron momentum is not conserved .",
    "this case applies to spatially nonuniform interfaces .",
    "however , similar results for the green functions , the dos and condensate correlation functions are expected for coherent tunneling .",
