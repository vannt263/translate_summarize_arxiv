    "it is usually claimed that the quantum state of the universe is described by a wavefunction @xcite which should account for all the physical information which can be extracted from the universe .",
    "two main approaches have been followed in order to obtain such a wavefunction of the universe .",
    "first , it can be obtained as the solution of the wheeler - de witt equation @xcite .",
    "this can actually be seen as a schrdinger equation in which no time derivative appears in order to satisfy the time invariance required by the general relativity theory @xcite . secondly , a path integral approach",
    "can also be taken @xcite .",
    "then , the wavefunction of the universe is given by a sum over all geometries and field configurations which can be matched with a given value of the field configuration , defined in a spatial section of the whole space - time manifold .",
    "we make a wick rotation to euclidean time in order to obtain well - defined integrals , and then rotate back to lorentzian time to obtain the final results .    in both cases ,",
    "some boundary conditions have to be imposed @xcite .",
    "the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal @xcite represents a universe which is created from `` nothing '' , meaning by that the absence of space , time and matter .",
    "vilenkin @xcite considered a universe which is also created from nothing , but through a quantum tunneling transition instead .",
    "vilenkin argued that the idea of a universe being created from nothing is not crazier than the creation of particle in other quantum theories .",
    "thus , it seems appropriate to consider that the universe may be created as a quantum fluctuation of the gravitational vacuum .",
    "once a universe nucleates in the space - time foam @xcite , it may bubble and eventually jump into an inflationary period @xcite , which is supposed to be the origin of our current universe .",
    "therefore , we must consider a multiverse in which changes in the topology of space - time are allowed .    a variety of multiverse hypotheses have been recently considered from different cosmological viewpoints @xcite .",
    "the specific meaning which is ascribed to a single universe depends on the formalism of the relevant theory .",
    "some well - known examples include the everett s many - world interpretation of the quantum theory @xcite , the chaotic inflationary multiverse @xcite or the landscape in string theory @xcite , among others ( for an exhaustive review , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we only consider the case of a multiverse which is described by a set of quantum oscillators , each one representing a causally disconnected region of the whole space - time .",
    "topology changes were first claimed to appear in the quantum physics of black hole evaporation @xcite , and so first arose as a result of trying to take quantum physics seriously as a description of the whole universe .",
    "on pure cosmological grounds , the transition from a matter dominated universe into a space - time filled with phantom energy provides us with another example of a bifurcating topology originated from the big rip singularity which splits space - time into two disconnected regions .",
    "creation of universes and therefore topology changes are naturally contemplated in the third quantization formalism @xcite .",
    "this consists of a further quantization of the wavefunction of the universe similarly to how quantum field theory is constructed from the schrdinger wavefunction of matter fields .",
    "the computations are difficult to perform in the general case . in this paper , however , a simplified model will be presented in which such computations can in fact be carried out .",
    "moreover , the general scheme of the third quantization formalism can be applied to both , a multiverse made up of parent universes and a space - time foam filled with virtual baby universes @xcite .",
    "parent universes are defined to be large space - time regions with a hubble length of the same order as the hubble length of our universe .",
    "baby universes are considered to be virtual fluctuations of the metric in the vacuum of gravity , and their contribution to calculations of the gravitational field is extremely important at the planck length .",
    "the gravitational vacuum would be also populated with virtual lorentzian and euclidean wormholes .",
    "the former can be seen as solutions of the einstein s equations with at least two asymptotically flat regions , connecting two separate parts either of the same universe or of two different universes .",
    "the latter can be considered as euclidean sectors of a friedman space - time @xcite , whose quantum states can be seen as the exponentially decaying versions of the oscillatory universes from which they were wick rotated .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum state of gravity might also be observable as far as it could induce a loss of quantum coherence in the matter fields .",
    "the debate was centered ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and @xcite ) around the assumption of taking doubly or even multiply connected wormholes instead of simply connected ones in the quantum vacuum of gravity .",
    "equivalently , it can be placed in terms of whether virtual baby universes are created as single universes or in pairs . in the theory of the quantum multiverse , in which it has been shown that general topological changes may occur",
    ", the loss of quantum coherence in the matter field sector seems to be unavoidable .",
    "our aim in this paper is then to apply the third quantization formalism given in ref .",
    "@xcite to a simplified model of the universe , which nevertheless retains the fundamental features of the quantum theory when it is applied to the universe as a whole .",
    "it will be shown that in such a model a well - defined quantum state for the multiverse can be obtained , which satisfies the usual boundary conditions .",
    "squeezed states @xcite , which are usually interpreted as quantum states without any classical analog @xcite , are found in the context of the multiverse , and in particular they appear in the context of accelerated universes . this seems to give support to the idea that the acceleration is due to distinctively quantum mechanical effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the third quantization formalism used in this paper shows some advantages respect to other approaches which are usually taken in quantum cosmology .",
    "for instance , it can be demonstrated that the quantum state of the multiverse may be given in terms of the states of a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "dealing with frequencies instead of potentials simplifies the computations .",
    "moreover , neither a perturbative nor a semiclassical approximation needs to be taken in the model presented in this paper , and therefore the state of the multiverse which is obtained can describe the global state of the multiverse as a whole .    before going any",
    "further , however , some caveats and comments should be made about the ideas and results considered in this paper .",
    "first of all , dealing with squeezed states in the context of the quantum state of the multiverse would , at first sight , seem somewhat extraneous .",
    "actually , squeezed states can be readily interpreted both in quantum optics and in a space - time foam made up of baby universes , which are both deployed in a common space - time .",
    "baby universes can in fact be taken as tiny particles representing small perturbations of the space - time field , whose quantum state affects the vacuum state of the matter field sector , and so this theory may turn out to be testable .    it is more difficult to imagine how we could test a theory of a multiverse made up of parent universes .",
    "it looks quite different even though wormhole communications channels may exist through which microscopic particles could travel from one universe to other @xcite . furthermore",
    ", some correlations among the quantum state of different universes could also be considered .",
    "for instance , if the creation of universes would be produced in entangled pairs , whose correlations might induce some observable effects on the state of each individual universe in the pair @xcite",
    ".    squeezed states have already been studied in other cosmological contexts such as the inflationary universe and gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the gravitational vacuum is populated by gravitons which evolve into a highly squeezed state . in this paper",
    "it is also demonstrated in the context of a third quantization formalism that a space - time foam made up of baby universes is in a squeezed state .",
    "if such a result could be extrapolated to parent universes , these universes might not be independent but quantum mechanically correlated , too .",
    "the paper can then be outlined as follows : a discussion with the main features of the third quantization formalism has been also added as sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , it is obtained the wavefunction for a quantum multiverse made up of friedmann space - times filled with an homogeneous and isotropic fluid , and the appropriate fock space is defined .",
    "we then analyze the two interesting limits of the quantum state of both a large parent universe and the quantum gravitational vacuum , which turn out to be described by a squeezed state with no classical analog . in sec .",
    "iv , the quantum state of the multiverse is represented by a density matrix rather than by a wavefunction , accounting thus for mixed states as well as pure ones .",
    "three representations are employed : first , the second quantized wavefunction is used as the configuration variable , the usual boundary conditions of refs .",
    "@xcite are applied and a probability interpretation can then be used .",
    "secondly , a general squeezed number representation is taken in order to study the quantum state of the multiverse .",
    "parent universes will be represented by number states .",
    "we show that the quantum state for the vacuum of baby universes is given by a squeezed state , and that high order correlations appear among them . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we have also used the usual @xmath0 representation in terms of coherent states . in sec .",
    "v , we compare the results obtained in this paper with previous works which have considered or criticized the third quantization formalism .",
    "the conclusions are collected in sec .",
    "vi , together with some comments to extend the model to a two - dimensional wave equation which would explicitly account for other matter fields .",
    "the basic idea of the third quantization formalism is @xcite : to treat the many - universe system as a quantum field theory on superspace .",
    "however , the name third quantization may be misleading . actually , the procedure is formally similar to that of the second quantization used in the quantum field theory of matter fields ( see , fig .",
    "[ comparative ] ) .",
    "the name third quantization comes from the fact that the field which is quantized is the wave function of the universe , and it depends on _ already _ second quantized matter fields , i.e. it depends on the particles existing within the universe .",
    "broadly speaking , the third quantization procedure starts from the wheeler - de witt equation , it takes one of the fields in that equation as a time variable and then we can proceed as it is usually done in quantum field theory .",
    "however , it not clear at all that such a time variable field can be found in the general 3 + 1 dimensional theory . such a field",
    "can be found in one - dimensional cosmological models as well as in 3 + 1 dimensional models with high symmetry .",
    "therefore , let us restrict our attention in this section to those cases .",
    "let us start then with one - dimensional model ( 1 temporal + 0 spatial dimensions ) . throughout this section",
    ", we are closely following ref .",
    "@xcite . in that model ,",
    "a universe is represented by a point in space .",
    "however , if topology changes are allowed , a many - universe system is rather described by a set of points . on the other hand , time dependent matter fields within the universes",
    "are contemplated .",
    "therefore , let us start with the second quantized action for such a system .",
    "it reads , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 represent @xmath4 matter fields , @xmath5 is the supermetric in that superspace and @xmath6 is the lapse function . for simplicity ,",
    "a mass term has been chosen to be the potential of the fields in the action ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "then , we can proceed as usual by defining the conjugate momenta of the fields , @xmath7 , and the hamiltonian density of the system , i.e. @xmath8 in the canonical quantization procedure , @xmath9 , and the classical hamiltonian constraint , @xmath10 , turns out to be , @xmath11 .",
    "this is the wheeler - de witt equation for the model being considered and then , @xmath12 , represents the ( second quantized ) wave function of a single universe .",
    "to third quantize this theory , let us find an action whose variational principle leads to the wheeler - de witt equation .",
    "this can be done with the following third quantized action , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "variation of the action ( [ a3 ] ) with respect to @xmath15 leads directly to the wheeler - de witt equation and , therefore , all the information of the second quantized theory is preserved in the third quantization formalism @xcite .",
    "the usual formalism of quantum field theory can then be directly applied to the third quantization many - universe system .",
    "for instance , the three point euclidean green function can be defined as @xcite ,    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the coupling constant and @xmath18 is the two point euclidean green function , i.e. @xmath19}.\\ ] ] @xmath20 $ ] is the euclidean version of the third quantized action ( [ a3 ] ) for this interaction scheme , i.e. @xmath21 thus , the third quantization formalism provides us with a system of interacting universes .",
    "for instance , the propagator ( [ a4 ] ) would physically represent the bifurcation of one universe ( see , fig .",
    "[ bifurcation ] ) .    we can also define a wave function for the whole multiverse , i.e. @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is the field chosen as a time variable and then , @xmath24 .",
    "it is given by the solution of the third quantized schrdinger equation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the third quantized hamiltonian ( not to be confused with the wheeler - de witt operator ( [ a2 ] ) ) .",
    "this is constructed from the action ( [ a3 ] ) with the momentum conjugate to the wave function of the universe defined by @xmath27 where , @xmath28 ( in the general covariant form , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the meaning of the wave function of the multiverse given by eq .",
    "( [ a7 ] ) can then be understood as follows : let , @xmath30 , be an orthonormal basis or number states , then @xmath31 where , @xmath32 , can be seen as the probability of @xmath33 universes at _ time _",
    "@xmath23 or the probability of @xmath33 universes with field values @xmath23 @xcite .    this formalism for one - dimensional universes can be adapted for 3 + 1 dimensional universes @xcite .",
    "the formalism has to be changed to account for the gauge symmetries which are not present in the one - dimensional case .",
    "however , some of the concepts of the one - dimensional case can be applied too to the case of more realistic universes .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the third quantization scheme , our single universe is just one universe within the whole many - universe system .",
    "nevertheless , in some approximation we have to recover the single universe we inhabit .",
    "this consists of a large region of the space - time of order of our hubble length called a parent universe .",
    "nevertheless , within a single parent universe quantum fluctuations of the metric can also be considered .",
    "let us notice that the gravitational action depends on the length scale and at planck length , such fluctuations become of the same order of the metric @xcite .",
    "thus , tiny regions of the space - time of order of the planck scale can virtually tunnel out of their parent space - time .",
    "these are called baby universes .",
    "the parent universe is influenced by such quantum fluctuations of the gravitational vacuum , for instance these can be seen as the source of a non - zero vacuum energy or cosmological constant , @xmath34 . in the third quantization scheme , therefore , we may say that a parent universe propagates then in a plasma of baby universes .",
    "it can be depicted as follows : let , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , be the wave functions of a parent and a baby universe , respectively .",
    "the second quantized action for each universe is given by eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) with masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "if we consider that the difference between the mass scale of a parent and a baby universes is large , i.e. @xmath39 , then , quantum transitions from baby to parent universes are exponentially suppressed . however , feynman diagrams like those represented in fig .",
    "[ bifurcation ] can still be considered .",
    "the third quantized action which represents then a single parent universe propagating in a plasma of baby universes is given by ,    @xmath40 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d x \\left ( - ( \\nabla\\phi_p)^2 + m_p^2 \\phi_p^2 - ( \\nabla\\phi_b)^2 + m_b^2 \\phi_b^2 + \\kappa \\phi_p^2 \\phi_b + \\frac{\\lambda}{3 } \\phi_b^3",
    "\\right ) .\\ ] ]    baby universes are not observable by themselves but their effects may be observable , so it seems to be better to consider an hybrid action . to do this we deal with @xmath35 as a wave function in the second quantized formalism and with @xmath41 as an operator in the third quantized formalism",
    ". then we can interpret baby universes as tiny particles deployed in the parent space - time .",
    "the result is an effective second quantized action for the parent universe in which a potential term appears accounting for the effects of the plasma of baby universes .",
    "in such a scheme , it can be assumed an effective interaction action of the form , @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 labels the different modes of the baby universe field ( i.e. it labels different species of baby universes ) , and @xmath44 is the insertion operator at the nucleation event .",
    "it defines the space - time points of the parent universe in which the baby universes effectively nucleate .",
    "let us now sketch the third quantization formalism in a more realistic model of the universe .",
    "let us consider then the case of an homogenous and isotropic space time with some matter fields defined upon it .",
    "for the sake of simplicity let us assume just one scalar field , @xmath45 ( the generalization to account for more matter fields can easily be done ) . in that case , the second quantized action can be written as @xcite @xmath46 , \\ ] ] where , @xmath6 is again the lapse function and , @xmath47 , being @xmath48 the scale factor .",

    "thus , for homogeneous and isotropic models it is clear that the scale factor can play the role of a time variable .",
    "this can also be seen from the signature of the minisupermetric ( [ a13 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the third quantization procedure can formally be applied in a similar way to the case of one - dimensional universes .",

    "therefore , although the most probable value for the cosmological constant would be zero in the realm of the whole multiverse , if it is taken to be formed up by pairs of universes , a non - zero value for the vacuum energy could be present in each single universe due to entanglement with its partner , which could be responsible both for the currently observed accelerating expansion and for the value of the vacuum energy in the inflationary era .",
    "in this paper , we have applied a third quantization formalism to the case of a multiverse made up of homogeneous and isotropic space - times filled with a perfect fluid .",
    "a well - defined quantum state of such a multiverse has been obtained in terms of the states of a harmonic oscillator , and it satisfies the most familiar boundary conditions which are used in quantum cosmology .",
    "it can also be given in terms of a wavefunction or a density matrix , accounting for pure and mixed states .",
    "thus , the third quantization scheme can be completely well - defined in these models of high symmetry .",
    "the state of the multiverse turns out to be given by a squeezed state with no classical analog . on the one hand ,",
    "the quantum state for a gravitational vacuum which is filled with a large number of popping baby universes and wormholes connecting them , is given by a squeezed state in which quantum correlations among the number states are dominant .",
    "this result agrees with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the vacuum state of gravity is populated with relic gravitons which unavoidably evolve also into a highly squeezed state having no classical analog . on the other hand , in the case of large parent universes the quantum correlations among the number states disappear asymptotically , the number state representation turns out to be an appropriate one and the single universe approximation can be then considered .",
    "thus , once a single parent universe can be assumed , quantum transitions to larger number states are asymptotically suppressed .",
    "notwithstanding , if universes are created in pairs , then the correlations in the quantum state of a pair of universes would imply that each single universe is not independent . then , one of the main non - independence consequences might be the presence of an entanglement energy , which could account for both the large value of the cosmological constant in the inflationary period and for the small value of the vacuum energy now , because the entanglement between the pair of universes decreases as each single universe expands .",
    "finally , let us notice that the model presented in this paper can be naturally extended to include local matter fields as well as cosmological fields . in the first case , it is expected that their effect would represent a minor correction to the value of the frequency of the harmonic oscillator which quantum mechanically described the multiverse . however , in the latter case , derivatives with respect to the matter fields appear in the wheeler - de witt equation , implying that the state of the multiverse is given in terms of the modes of a wave equation in which the mass and the frequency might be scale factor dependent .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that it will be easier to work with the solutions of such a wave equation rather than with the general solutions of the second quantized theory .",
