    "within the framework of hierarchical structure formation , galaxies form within virialized dark - matter ( dm ) halos . the halo properties and their time evolution can be predicted robustly within a given cold dark matter ( cdm ) model using n - body simulations or analytic approximations .",
    "a fundamental property of a dm halo is its maximum circular velocity , which is likely to be related to the observable internal velocity of the luminous galaxy that resides in the halo .    in the local universe",
    ", it is well known that galaxies obey fundamental scaling relations , including the relation between total luminosity and internal velocity ( commonly known as tully - fisher or faber - jackson relations ) , which we will focus on here .",
    "this lv relationship surely reflects some fundamental aspect of galaxy formation , although its origin is poorly understood .",
    "an observational determination of the _ redshift evolution _ of this relationship would provide crucial clues as to its physical origin and would constitute an important constraint on models of galaxy formation .",
    "however , a direct observational determination of the internal velocities of galaxies at high redshift is extremely difficult .",
    "rotation curves have been obtained for a small number of galaxies up to redshift @xmath5 ( vogt et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "these results suggest that there is little evolution in the tully - fisher relation for objects similar to local large spirals out to @xmath5 ( but see mallen - ornelas et al .",
    "1999 ) . at higher redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , no direct observations are yet available .",
    "while galaxies of different morphological types obey different lv relations , one can define a mean lv relation for any given morphological mix .",
    "this can be used to make a direct connection between the distribution functions of galaxies in terms of their _ internal velocity _ and _ luminosity_. clearly , if the evolution of the velocity function is predicted by theory , and the evolution of the luminosity function is determined observationally , this connection can provide a constraint on the evolution of the lv relation .    determining the number density of galaxies as a function of their rest - frame luminosity is considerably easier than measuring their rotation velocities directly at high redshift . observed luminosities can be k - corrected to the rest visual frame up to @xmath7 using multi - band photometry extending into the near - ir .",
    "it has been very difficult to obtain spectroscopic redshifts in the ` desert ' regime of @xmath8 , but photometric redshifts offer a means of filling in this gap .",
    "these advances , combined with theoretical progress in predicting the number density and structural properties of dark matter halos , suggest the approach for constraining the redshift evolution of the lv relation that we exploit here .",
    "the basis of our analysis is the evolution of the velocity function of dm halos as determined via a high - resolution n - body simulation of the cosmology ( sigad et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter s00 ) .",
    "we extend these results to other cosmologies using analytic models .",
    "we consider a wide range of possibilities for the redshift evolution of the lv relation , including some motivated by the results of semi - analytic models ( cf . somerville & primack 1999 ) . we then present predictions of the corresponding redshift evolution of the comoving number density of bright galaxies , which may be compared directly with observations to provide quantitative constraints on how the lv relation evolves in time .",
    "we have calculated the velocity function of dm halos using an n - body simulation of the currently popular flat   model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , hubble constant @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the simulation ( klypin 1999 ) used a high - resolution adaptive refinement tree code ( kravtsov , klypin & khokhlov 1997 ) to follow the evolution of structure in a periodic box of comoving side 60@xmath13 , with a force resolution of @xmath14 in the densest regions .",
    "we identify bound , virialized halos using a spherical overdensity - based algorithm and the standard definition of virial density from the spherical top - hat collapse model ( cf .",

    "details of the halo finder are described in bullock ( 2000 ; hereafter b00 ) .",
    "although the virial velocity @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 ar the virial mass and radius ) is often used to approximate galactic circular velocities , a more relevant quantity observationally is the maximum rotation velocity of the halo @xmath18 , which can be related to @xmath19 via the halo density profile .",
    "over relevant radii , halo density profiles are well approximated by the nfw functional form with two free parameters ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the radius at which the log slope of the profile is @xmath22 .",

    "the value of @xmath26 is closely related to the halo mass , and for a typical dm halo surrounding a bright galaxy ( @xmath28 ) at @xmath29 , our simulations yield @xmath30 , implying @xmath31 .",
    "the concentration at a fixed mass evolves rapidly with redshift , @xmath32 ( b00 ) , implying a corresponding evolution in @xmath33 .",

    ", we note an increase of @xmath52 in the density for constant @xmath34 between @xmath29 and @xmath53 , and a gradual decline back to today s density by @xmath54 .",
    "the density of halos of a constant @xmath19 grows by a factor @xmath55 by @xmath53 , and then declines at higher @xmath40 .",
    "note that a halo with a fixed @xmath19 has a decreasing mass and virial radius at increasing redshift .",
    "compared to , the ocdm model predicts a slightly larger increase in the density of @xmath0 halos at all redshifts . in the case of @xmath46cdm ,",
    "the peak density is obtained at @xmath56 , followed by a sharper decline , but note that even in this case the comoving density at @xmath57 is comparable to the density at @xmath29 .",
    "armed with this knowledge about the evolution of the halo velocity function , we can now predict the evolution of the number density of galaxies brighter than a fixed absolute luminosity for a given model of lv evolution .",
    "a possible hitch is that the halo maximum velocity @xmath34 typically occurs at a radius @xmath58 that lies outside the luminous parts of the galaxy for which the lv quantities are measured .",
    "for example , a @xmath59 halo at @xmath29 has @xmath60kpc .",
    "the velocity due to the halo alone obviously declines at smaller radii , but the condensed baryons contribute significantly to the total circular velocity there .",
    "we therefore make the assumption that the rotation curve is roughly flat between where it is measured and @xmath58 , i.e. that the halo @xmath34 is the same as the velocity used in the observed lv relations .",
    "gonzalez ( 1999 ; g99 ) used this assumption at @xmath29 to compare the velocity function of dm halos with that obtained from observed luminosity functions and lv relations .",
    "the good agreement that they obtained is evidence that this is a reasonable approximation at low redshift .",
    "we now assume that this relation holds at high redshift as well .",
    "we parameterize the mean lv relation as : @xmath61 , where only the zero - point may evolve in time according to the parametric functional form @xmath62 we choose @xmath63 and @xmath64 , corresponding to the empirical local lv relation used in g99 .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 allow a wide range of shapes , where @xmath65 governs the behavior at @xmath67 , and @xmath66 the asymptotic shape at larger redshifts .",
    "the indications for only little evolution at @xmath68 guide us to consider mostly large positive values for @xmath65 , while the value of @xmath66 is unconstrained , and even its sign is unknown .    in figure 2",
    "we consider five different representative cases for the lv zero - point evolution @xmath69 , and show the predicted evolution of the number density of galaxies with @xmath70 , relative to their number density at @xmath29 .",
    "the case @xmath71 is the case of no evolution in the lv relation . the case @xmath72 is close to the evolution predicted for the  model if the mass - to - light ratio is constant in time . in this model , because halos of fixed @xmath34 have smaller masses at high redshift , they are fainter and therefore the predicted number of bright galaxies decreases .    the case @xmath73 is close to the prediction of a semi - analytic model ( the `` accelerated quiescent '' model of somerville , primack , & faber 2000 ) in which the efficiency of star formation scales with the inverse dynamical time of the halo .",
    "this scaling is motivated by one of the empirical recipes suggested kennicutt ( 1998 ) , based on observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "the dynamical time for a halo of a fixed velocity is smaller at high redshift ( because of the higher density ) , and so galaxies of a fixed velocity are _",
    "brighter_. this model predicts an _ increase _ in the number density of bright galaxies out to @xmath74 . although this star formation recipe is a standard choice in semi - analytic models ( e.g. , kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ) , note that it predicts fairly strong evolution in the lv relation even at @xmath5 .",

    "redshift surveys of the past decade were unable to reach the higher redshift range @xmath81 associated with the spectroscopic desert or ` high place of sacrifice ' .",
    "the results presented by dickinson ( 2000 ) , based on nicmos ( near - ir ) imaging of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) suggest that the assembly of present - day luminous galaxies may be taking place precisely in this redshift interval . using photometric redshifts , dickinson finds that there are only one - third as many galaxies with rest - frame @xmath82 in the redshift interval @xmath83 as in the interval @xmath84 . in our fiducial cosmology ,",
    "the comoving volumes of the hdf for these two intervals are equal , implying an overall drop in the comoving number density at @xmath85 of about a factor of three . taken at face value , this would correspond to dramatic evolution in the lv relation at @xmath6 , rather similar to the most extreme ` dimming ' model shown in figure  2 .",
    "probably the weakest link in our calculation is our assumption that the halo maximum velocity is the same as the measured internal velocity for a galaxy .",
    "the actual measured velocity will depend on the baryon fraction in the galaxy , the spatial distribution of the baryons , and the degree to which angular momentum is preserved in the collapse .",
    "however , note that because we expressed the space density in figure  2 _ relative _ to that at @xmath29 , our plotted results will not change by much as long as the ratio of observed velocity to the halo maximum velocity , @xmath86 , is of order unity and roughly constant with redshift .",
    "we have calculated the value of @xmath87 using a simple analytic model of disk formation , which assumes that a constant fraction of the halo mass condenses into a disk , and angular momentum is conserved ( mo , mao , & white 1998 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath88 for the redshift range @xmath89 , and falls to @xmath90 by @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests that our predictions should be reasonably robust at least out to @xmath7 .",
    "how significant is the effect seen in the hdf ?",
    "one possibility is that galaxies are preferentially missed at @xmath91 because of the @xmath92 cosmological surface - brightness dimming .",
    "dickinson ( 2000 ) claims that this is unlikely to be a large effect ; when bright hdf galaxies from @xmath93 are artificially redshifted to @xmath94 with no intrinsic luminosity evolution , most of them are still easily detectable .",
    "another possibility is that the photometric redshifts are inaccurate ; dickinson points out that there are _ no _ spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath95 where the deficit is seen . however",
    ", this would require quite a dramatic failure where _ all _ of the galaxies ( with photometric redshifts ) assigned to @xmath96 would have to be reassigned to the higher redshift range .",
    "most importantly , recall that the hdf covers a relatively small volume , and therefore random fluctuations along the line of sight are likely to be large .",
    "the observed deficit of galaxies might simply reflect large - scale `` spikes '' in the redshift distribution . although there is some evidence for a similar deficit of bright galaxies at @xmath97 in other deep optical / ir surveys ( fontana et al .",
    "1999 ) , secure confirmation of these results will require deep wide - field surveys with multi - band optical - ir photometry .",
    "several such surveys are now in progress ( e.g. the cambridge - carnegie las campanas ir survey ) .",
    "moreover , the deep survey ( davis & faber 1998 ) will obtain measured line - widths for a large number of galaxies at @xmath98 , which will provide direct constraints on the lv relation at high redshift .",
    "finally , our results may be relevant to a recent proposal by newman & davis ( 2000 ) to use velocity - selected galaxies as a tracer population in a classical @xmath99 measure of cosmological parameters .",
    "this analysis would be subject to similar uncertainties in relating the halo velocity to observable galaxy velocity , e.g. , the dependence on whether the halos are selected by @xmath34 or @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , because the proposed spectroscopic surveys are magnitude limited , the indicated evolution of the lv relation could introduce severe selection biases into the analysis .",
