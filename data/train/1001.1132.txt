    "our interest in and the eventual development of the pbm goes back many years to the early nineteen eighties .",
    "van hove s work@xcite in the early eighties considered the bubbles as small droplets of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) assumed to be produced in ultra - relativistic collisions of hadrons and/or nuclei .",
    "his work recognized that experimental detectors only see what is emitted in the final state at kinetic freezeout .",
    "therefore final state predictions of his string model work on plasma bubbles or any other theory required specific convincing predictions that are observable in the final state which can be measured by experiment .",
    "his work predicted that the final state rapidity distribution dn / dy of hadrons would exhibit isolated maxima of width @xmath4 ( single bubble ) or rapidity bumps of a few units ( due to those cases producing a few bubbles ) .",
    "these rapidity regions would also contain traditional signals of qgp formation .",
    "even this early work by van hove needed his bubbles near the surface of the final state fireball in order to experimentally measure the particles emitted in the final state at kinetic freezeout .",
    "we and other searched for these van hove bubbles , but no one ever found any significant evidence for them .",
    "our next paper@xcite was our final attempt to make a theoretical treatment of the single bubble case ( similar to the van hove case ) which could be experimentally verified .",
    "it is possible that with enough statistics one in principle could find single to a few bubble events .",
    "we developed a number of event generators which could possibly provide evidence for striking signals resulting from these bubbles .",
    "one should note that in that paper we had included in sec .",
    "11 mathematical expressions describing how charged pions are effected by strong color electric and color magnetic fields which are present and parallel in a cp - odd bubble of metastable vacuum .",
    "this section was motivated by the work of kharzeev and pisarski@xcite .",
    "for example eq . 3 - 4 of the section",
    "show the boosts of the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 we estimated .",
    "thus in 2000 we were already interested in and were investigating and publishing predictions for this phenomenon .",
    "when we considered the rhic quantum interference data in 2000@xcite it became clear that the fireball surface was rapidly moving outward .",
    "this implied a very large phase space region covered by the fireball , and also implied that it would be very unlikely for there to be only one isolated bubble ( small source size ) with a large amount of energy sitting on the surface .",
    "it seemed more likely that there would be many bubbles or gluonic hot spots around the expanding surface .",
    "this led to a paper@xcite which was our earlier version of ref.@xcite . in that paper",
    "we concluded that the behavior of the hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) measurements@xcite should be interpreted as evidence of a substructure of bubbles located on the surface of the final state fireball in the central rapidity region at kinetic freezeout .",
    "the hbt radii were decreasing almost linearly with transverse momentum and implying to us a source size of @xmath72 fm radii bubbles were on the surface and could be selected for if we considered transverse momenta above 0.8 gev / c .",
    "these momenta would allow sufficient resolution to resolve individual bubbles of @xmath72 fm radii .",
    "we further concluded that these hbt quantum interference observations were likely due to phase space focusing of the bubbles pushed by the expanding fireball .",
    "thus the hbt measurements of source size extrapolated to transverse momenta above 0.8 gev / c were images of the bubbles .",
    "the hbt correlation has the property of focusing these images on top of each other for a ring of bubbles transverse to and centered on the beam forming an average hbt radius .",
    "thus our model was a ring of bubbles sitting on the freezeout surface with average size @xmath72 fm radius perpendicular to the beam at mid - rapidity .",
    "the phase space focusing would also lead to angular correlations between particles emitted by the bubbles and be observable .",
    "1 shows the geometry of the bubbles . for the background particles that account for particles in addition to the bubble particles we used unquenched hijing@xcite with its jets removed .",
    "we assumed that most of the jets were eliminated from the central events because of the strong jet quenching observed at rhic@xcite .",
    "we investigated the feasibility of using charged - particle - pair correlations as a function of angles which should be observable due to the phase space focusing of the particles coming from individual bubbles .",
    "at that point we fully expected that these correlations would be observable in the star detector@xcite at rhic if one analyzed central au au collisions .",
    "correlation analyses are powerful tools in detecting substructures .",
    "historically substructures have played an important role in advancing our understanding of strong ( non perturbative ) interactions .",
    "our earlier paper explained the general characteristics of the angular correlation data , and was also consistent with hbt measurements in a qualitative manner .",
    "this motivated us to develop a reasonably quantitative model , the parton bubble model@xcite which is discussed in the following .",
    "in this publication@xcite we developed a qcd inspired parton bubble model ( pbm ) for central ( impact parameter near zero ) high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the pbm is based on a substructure consisting of a single ring of a dozen adjoining 2-fm - radius bubbles ( gluonic hot spots ) transverse to the collider beam direction , centered on the beam , and located at or near mid - rapidity .",
    "the at or near mid - rapidity refers to the boost invariant region that exist in the rhic heavy ion collisions which spans 2 - 4 units of rapidity .",
    "because of this spread in @xmath8 , we will use the relative spread of particles in @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in order to capture the angular correlations along the beam axis .",
    "the ring resides on the fireball blast wave surface ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we assumed these bubbles are likely the final state result of quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) formation since the energy densities produced experimentally are greater than those estimated as necessary for formation of a quark - gluon - plasma .",
    "thus this is the geometry for the final state kinetic freezeout of the qgp bubbles on the surface of the expanding fireball treated in a blast wave model .",
    "the average behavior of emitted final state particles coming from the surface bubbles at kinetic freezeout is given by the ring of twelve bubbles formed by energy density fluctuations near the surface of the expanding fireball of the blast wave .",
    "one should note that the blast wave surface is moving at its maximum velocity at freezeout ( 3c/4 ) . for central events each of the twelve bubbles have 3 - 4 partons per bubble each at a fixed @xmath10 for a given bubble .",
    "this number of partons was determined from correlation data analyzed by the star experiment@xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) distribution of the charged particles is similar to pqcd but has a suppression at high @xmath2 like the data .",
    "the bubble ring radius of our model was estimated by blast wave , hbt and other general considerations to be approximately 8 fm .",
    "the bubbles emit correlated charged particles at final - state kinetic freezeout where we select a @xmath2 range ( 0.8 gev / c @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 4.0 gev / c ) in order to increase signal to background .",
    "the 0.8 gev / c @xmath2 cut increases the resolution to allow resolving individual bubbles which have a radius of @xmath72 fm .",
    "this space momentum correlation of the blast wave provides us with a strong angular correlation signal .",
    "pythia fragmentation functions@xcite were used for the bubbles fragmentation that generate the final state particles emitted from the bubbles . a single parton using pythia forms a jet with the parton having a fixed @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "the 3 - 4 partons in the bubble which shower using pythia all have a different @xmath8 value but all have the same @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "the pbm explained the high precision au au central ( 0 - 10% ) collisions at @xmath11 200 gev@xcite ( the highest rhic energy ) .",
    "we utilize a two particle correlation function in the two dimensional ( 2-d ) space of @xmath12 vs @xmath9 . the azimuthal angle @xmath10 of a particle is defined by the angle of the particle with respect to the vertical axis which is perpendicular to the beam axis and is measured in a clock - wise direction about the beam .",
    "@xmath12 is the difference , @xmath13 - @xmath14 , of the @xmath10 angle of a pair of particles ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity @xmath8 of a particle is measured along one of the beam directions .",
    "@xmath9 is the difference , @xmath15 - @xmath16 , of the @xmath8 values of a pair of particles ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the two dimensional ( 2-d ) total correlation function is defined as :    @xmath17    where s(@xmath18 ) is the number of pairs at the corresponding values of @xmath18 coming from the same event , after we have summed over all the events .",
    "m(@xmath18 ) is the number of pairs at the corresponding values of @xmath18 coming from the mixed events , after we have summed over all our created mixed events .",
    "a mixed event pair has each of the two particles chosen from a different event .",
    "we make on the order of ten times the number of mixed events as real events .",
    "we rescale the number of pairs in the mixed events to be equal to the number of pairs in the real events .",
    "this procedure implies a binning in order to deal with finite statistics . to enhance comparison we use the same binning in our simulations as is used by the star high precision experimental analyses@xcite .",
    "the division by m(@xmath18 ) for experimental data essentially removes or drastically reduces acceptance and instrumental effects . if the mixed pair distribution was the same as the real pair distribution c(@xmath18 )",
    "would be one for all values of the binned @xmath18 . in the correlations used in this paper we select particles independent of its charge .",
    "the correlation of this type is called a charge independent ( ci ) correlation .",
    "this difference correlation function has the defined property that it only depends on the differences of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath12 ) and the beam angle ( @xmath9 ) for the two particle pair .",
    "thus the two dimensional difference correlation distribution for each bubble which is part of c(@xmath18 ) is similar for each of our 12 bubbles and will image on top of each other .",
    "the pbm fit to the angular correlation data was reasonably quantitative to within a few percent ( see fig . 4 and fig .",
    "5 ) ) .",
    "the correlation functions we employed ( like the hbt correlation functions ) have the property that for the difference in angles ( difference of momentum for hbt ) these correlations will image all 12 bubbles on top of each other .",
    "this leads to average observed angles of approximately @xmath19 in @xmath12 , @xmath20 in @xmath9 , originating from a source size of about @xmath72 fm radius which is consistent with the hbt correlation .",
    "thus the pbm generates @xmath12 vs @xmath9 charged - particle - pair correlations for charged particles with @xmath2 in the range 0.8 gev / c to 4.0 gev / c as displayed in fig . 4 and fig .",
    "we show the ci correlation in fig .",
    "5 a reasonably quantitative successful comparison with data .",
    "it should be noted that the spread in @xmath9 of the bubble is determined by the longitudinal momentum distribution of the 3 - 4 partons that make up the bubble .",
    "this distribution which is quassian in nature was adjusted to the observed @xmath9 width of correlation data analyzed by the star experiment@xcite .",
    "furthermore the model results were consistent with the hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) observations@xcite that the observed source radii determined by quantum statistical interference were reducing by a considerable factor with increasing transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the hbt radii are interpreted to reduce from @xmath76 fm at @xmath2 @xmath70.2 gev / c to @xmath72 fm at @xmath2 @xmath71 gev / c for our @xmath2 range .",
    "the generally accepted explanation for this behavior is that as @xmath2 increases radial flow increasingly focused the viewed region of the final state into smaller volumes .",
    "if just one small hbt size bubble were emitting all the correlated particles , this phenomena would lead to large spikes of particles emitted at one limited @xmath10 angular region in individual events .",
    "this is definitely not observed in the au au or other collision data at rhic .",
    "therefore , a distributed ring of small sources around the beam as assumed in the pbm is necessary to explain both the hbt results@xcite and the correlation data@xcite .",
    "the particles emitted from the same bubble are virtually uncorrelated to particles emitted from any other bubble except for momentum conservation requirements .",
    "an away side peak in the total correlation is built up from momentum conservation between the bubbles .",
    "the pbm was also recently extended to pbme@xcite which is identical to the pbm for central collisions ( 0 - 5% ) . for centralities running from 30 - 80% jet quenching",
    "is not strong enough to make jets negligible therefore , a jet component was added which was based on hijing calculations .",
    "this jet component accounts for more of the correlation as one moves toward peripheral bins , and explains all of it for the most peripheral collisions .",
    "the pbme explained in a reasonably quantitative manner ( within a few percent ) the behavior of the recent quantitative experimental analysis of charge pair correlations as a function of centrality@xcite .",
    "this further strengthened the substantial evidence for bubble substructure .",
    "the agreement of the pbm and the pbme surface emission models with experimental analyses strongly implied that at kinetic freezeout the fireball was dense and opaque in the central region and most centralities ( except the peripheral region ) in the intermediate transverse momentum region ( 0.8 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 4.0",
    "gev / c ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the observed correlated particles are both formed and emitted from or near the surface of the fireball . in the peripheral region",
    "the path to the surface is always small .",
    "the ci correlation used in fig . 4 and the pbm@xcite is also defined as the sum of two charged - particle - pair correlations .",
    "they are the unlike - sign charge pairs ( us ) and the like - sign charge pairs ( ls ) .",
    "this charge independent correlation ( ci ) is defined as the correlation made up of charged - particle - pairs independent of what the sign is , which is the average of the us plus the ls correlations .",
    "thus ci = ( us + ls)/2 .",
    "therefore the ci is the total charge pair correlation observed in the experimental detection system within its acceptance .",
    "the ci was generated for @xmath0 = 200 gev central ( 0 - 5% ) au au collisions in the @xmath2 range 0.8 gev / c to 4.0 gev / c at rhic .",
    "when the ci was compared to the corresponding experimental analyses@xcite a reasonably quantitative agreement within a few percent of the observed ci was attained .",
    "see ref.@xcite sec .",
    "4.2 , ref.@xcite sec .",
    "v , and ref.@xcite sec .",
    "vi b. this analysis and our previous work@xcite was done without using a jet trigger .",
    "in fact jet production in the central region was negligible due to strong jet quenching@xcite .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "4 the central ci correlation of @xmath12 on the near side ( @xmath12 @xmath1 @xmath21 ) , is sharp and approximately jetlike at all @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast the @xmath9 dependence is relatively flat . in the central production",
    "the average observed angles are approximately @xmath19 in @xmath12 and @xmath20 in @xmath9 .",
    "it is of interest to note that the sharp jetlike collimation in @xmath12 persists at all centralities ( 0 - 80% ) .",
    "the elongation in @xmath9 persists in the 0 - 30% centrality range and then decreases with decreasing centrality becoming jetlike in the peripheral bins .",
    "these characteristics are in reasonable quantitative agreement with the fits of the pbm and the pbme to experimental data analyses@xcite .",
    "the difference of the us and ls correlations is defined as the charge dependent ( cd ) correlation ( cd = us - ls ) .",
    "the 2-d experimental cd correlation for centralities ( 0 - 80% ) has a jetlike shape which is consistent with pythia jets ( vacuum fragmentation ) for all centralities .",
    "this clearly implies that both particle hadronization and emission occur from the fireball surface region as explained in ref.@xcite sec .",
    "a glasma flux tube model ( gftm)@xcite that had been developed considers that the wavefunctions of the incoming projectiles , form sheets of color glass condensates ( cgc)@xcite that at high energies collide , interact , and evolve into high intensity color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this collection of primordial fields is the glasma@xcite , and initially it is composed of only rapidity independent longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "an essential feature of the glasma is that the fields are localized in the transverse space of the collision zone with a size of 1/@xmath22 .",
    "@xmath22 is the saturation momentum of partons in the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "these longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields generate topological chern - simons charge@xcite which becomes a source for particle production .",
    "the transverse space is filled with flux tubes of large longitudinal extent but small transverse size @xmath7@xmath23 .",
    "particle production from a flux tube is a poisson process , since the flux tube is a coherent state .",
    "as the partons emitted from these flux tubes locally equilibrate , transverse flow builds due to the radial flow of the blast wave@xcite .",
    "the flux tubes that are near the surface of the fireball get the largest radial flow and are emitted from the surface . as in the parton bubble model these partons shower and the higher @xmath2 particles escape the surface and do not interact .",
    "these flux tubes are in the present paper considered strongly connected to the bubbles of the pbm .",
    "the method used to connect the pbm and the gftm is described and discussed in the next section v.    @xmath22 is around 1 gev / c thus the transverse size of the flux tube is about 1/4 fm .",
    "the flux tubes near the surface are initially at a radius @xmath75 fm .",
    "the @xmath10 angle wedge of the flux tube is @xmath71/20 radians or @xmath7@xmath24 .",
    "thus the flux tube initially has a narrow range in @xmath10 .",
    "the large width in the @xmath9 correlation which in the pbm depended on the large spread in @xmath9 of the bubble partons results from the independent longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields that created the glasma flux tubes .",
    "how much of these longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields are still present in the surface flux tubes when they have been pushed by the blast wave will be a speculation of this paper for measuring strong cp violation ?    it has been noted that significant features of the pbm that generated final state correlations which fit the experimentally observed correlation data@xcite are similar to those predicted by the gftm@xcite .",
    "therefore in the immediately following section we assume a direct connection of the pbm and the gtm , give reasons to justify it , and then discuss its consequences , predictions and successes .",
    "the successes of the pbm have strongly implied that the final state surface region bubbles of the pbm represent a significant substructure . in this subsection",
    "we show that the characteristics of our pbm originally developed to fit the precision star au au correlation data in a manner consistent with the hbt data ; implies that the bubble substructure we originally used to fit these previous data is closely related to the gftm .",
    "a natural way to connect the pbm bubbles to the gftm flux tubes is to assume that the final state at kinetic freezeout of a flux tube is a pbm final state bubble .",
    "thus the initial transverse size of a flux tube @xmath71/4 fm has expanded to the size of @xmath72 fm at kinetic freezeout . with this assumption",
    "we find consistency with the theoretical expectations of the gftm .",
    "we can generate and explain the triggered ridge phenomenon and data ( see sec .",
    "vi ) , thus implying the ridge is connected to the bubble substructure . we can predict and obtain very strong evidence for the color electric field of the glasma from comparing our multi - particle charged particle correlation predictions , and existing experimental correlation publications ( see sec .",
    "vii ) . we have also predicted correlations which can be used to search for evidence for the glasma color magnetic field ( sec .",
    "of course an obvious question that arises is that since a flux tube is an isolated system does a pbm bubble , that we assume is the final state of a flux tube at kinetic freezeout , also act as an isolated system when emitting the final state particles ?",
    "the near side correlations signals since the original pbm@xcite have always come virtually entirely from particles emitted from the same bubble .",
    "thus each bubble has always acted as an isolated system similar to the behavior of a flux tube .",
    "in heavy ion collisions at rhic there has been observed a phenomenon called the ridge which has many different explanations@xcite .",
    "the ridge is a long range charged particle correlation in @xmath9 ( very flat ) , while the @xmath12 correlation is approximately jet - like ( a narrow gaussian ) .",
    "there also appears with the ridge a jet - like charged - particle - pair correlation which is symmetric in @xmath9 and @xmath12 such that the peak on the jet - like correlation is at @xmath9 = 0 and @xmath12 = 0 .",
    "the @xmath12 correlation of the jet and the ridge are approximately the same and smoothly blend into each other .",
    "the ridge correlation is generated when one triggers on an intermediate @xmath2 range charged particle and then forms pairs between that trigger particle and each of all other intermediate charged particles with a smaller @xmath2 down to some lower limit .",
    "the first case we will study in this paper is a trigger charged particle between 3.0 to 4.0 gev / c correlated with all other charged particles which have a @xmath2 between 1.1 gev / c to 3.0 gev / c .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate whether the pbm can account for the ridge once we add a jet trigger to our pbm generator@xcite . however",
    "this trigger will also select jets which previously could be neglected because there was such strong quenching@xcite of jets in central collisions .",
    "a jet trigger had not been used in the pbm comparison to all previous data .",
    "we use hijing@xcite merely to determine the expected number of jets to add for our added jet trigger .",
    "these jet particles were added to our pbm generator .",
    "thus our pbm generator now had hijing generated background particles , bubbles of the pbm and added jet particles from hijing .",
    "we have already shown that our final state particles come from hadrons at or near the fireball surface .",
    "we reduce the number of jets by 80% which corresponds to the estimate that only the parton interactions on or near the surface are not quenched away , and thus at kinetic freezeout form and emit hadrons which enter the detector .",
    "this 80% reduction is consistent with single @xmath25 suppression observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find for the reduced hijing jets that 4% of the au au central events ( 0 - 5% ) centrality at @xmath11 200 have a charged particle with a @xmath2 between 3.0 and 4.0 gev / c with at least one other charged particle with its @xmath2 greater than 1.1 gev / c coming from the same jet .",
    "the addition of the jets to the pbm generator provides the appropriate particles which are picked up by the trigger in order to form a narrow @xmath9 correlation signal at 0 which is also a narrow signal in @xmath12 at 0 ( fig .",
    "this narrow jet signal is present in the data and is what remains of jets after 80% are quenched away .",
    "we then form two - charged - particle correlations between one - charged - particle with a @xmath2 between 3.0 to 4.0 gev / c and another charged particle whose @xmath2 is greater than 1.1 gev / c .",
    "the results of these correlations are shown in fig .",
    "6 is the ci correlation for the 0 - 5% centrality bin with the just above stated @xmath2 selections on charge pairs .",
    "since we know in our monte carlo which particles are emitted from bubbles and thus form the ridge , we can predict the shape of the ridge for the above @xmath2 cut by plotting only the correlation formed from pairs of particles that are emitted by the same bubble ( see fig .",
    "the charge pair correlations are virtually all emitted from the same bubble .",
    "those charge pair correlations formed from particles originating from different bubbles are small contributors which mainly have some effect on the away side correlation .",
    "7 is the ridge signal which is the piece of the ci correlation for the 0 - 5% centrality of fig .",
    "6 , after removing all other pairs except the pairs emitted from the same bubble .",
    "a very important aspect of the gftm is the boost that the flux tubes get from the radial flow of the blast wave .",
    "this boost is the same all along the flux tube and only depends on how far away from the center axis of the blast wave the flux tube is . in the pbm",
    "the partons in the bubble received a boost in @xmath2 from the radial flow field in the blast wave ; that after final state fragmentation of the bubbles gave the generated particles a consistent @xmath2 spectrum with the data . since the boost from the blast wave depended on the position of the bubble in the radial flow field , there should be a correlation between partons @xmath2 within a bubble .",
    "if one redistributed the partons with their @xmath2 boosts uniformly among the bubbles , the over all results for the generated correlations without a trigger would be unchanged .",
    "one should note none of our prior work ( i.e.pbm@xcite or pbme@xcite ) contained a trigger .",
    "we have only added a trigger here to treat the `` triggered ridge '' which obviously requires it . in our treatment of the gftm ( sec .",
    "vii ) we have removed the trigger .    once we require a trigger demanding higher @xmath2 particles , we start picking out bubbles which have more radial flow ( harder particles ) . thus correlated particles which pass our @xmath2 selection and trigger come almost entirely from the harder bubbles with more radial flow , while the softer bubbles which were subject to less radial flow mainly generate low enough @xmath2 particles that become background particles or are lost to the correlation analysis due to @xmath2 selection .",
    "figure 6 shows the result of our trigger and @xmath2 selection .",
    "if one redistributed the partons with their @xmath2 radial flow boost among all the bubbles , then all bubbles become equal and there is no longer soft and hard bubbles . with this change",
    "we can generate bubble events .",
    "we find that both the non - triggered correlation and the @xmath12 correlation are virtually unchanged in the region less than about @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "it seems that we move from the situation where we have a few bubbles with a lot of correlated particles above our @xmath2 cut to a lot of bubbles that have few correlated particles above our cuts .",
    "however there is a difference in the triggered correlation s away side or @xmath12 near the @xmath27 peak .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we discuss this away side effect and attributed this peak to momentum conservation .",
    "this is however not the whole story .",
    "the away side peak is generated by the geometry of the bubble ring which requires that for every bubble there is another bubble nearly @xmath27 away that is emitting particles .",
    "these symmetry requirements on the geometry contribute more to the away side peak especially for the case without a trigger or redistributed random partons .",
    "this geometry effect is what causes the away side correlation of elliptic flow in a peripheral heavy ion collision .",
    "in such a collision there is a higher energy density aligned with the reaction plane .",
    "on one side of the reaction plane there are more particles produced because of increased energy density , and because of the geometry of the situation . on the other side of the reaction plane",
    "there are also more particles produced for the same reasons .",
    "thus there is a correlation between particles that are near each other on one side of the reaction plane and a correlation between particles that are on both sides of the reaction plane .",
    "momentum conservation requires particle communication by bouncing into each other , while geometry has no such communication .",
    "the right hand does not need to know what the left hand is doing .",
    "however , if physics symmetry makes them do the same thing then they can show a correlation .",
    "the away side peak depends on the fragmentation of the away side bubble . for the triggered case where",
    "there is a hard bubble with a strong correlation of parton @xmath2 inside the bubble ( gftm like ) , we will have more correlated particles adding to the signal on the near side . on the other hand",
    "the away side bubble will be on average a softer bubble which will have a lot less particles passing the @xmath2 cuts and thus have a smaller signal .",
    "if we consider the case of a random parton @xmath2 bubble the particles passing the @xmath2 cuts should be very similar on the near and the away side .",
    "8 we compare the two correlations generated by the correlated and the random cases .",
    "we compare the @xmath12 correlation for the two cases ( solid is correlated and open is random)for each of the five @xmath9 bins which cover the entire @xmath9 range ( 0.0 to 1.5 ) . the vertical correlation scale is not offset and is correct for the largest @xmath9 bin , 1.2 @xmath28 1.5 , which is the lowest bin on the figure .",
    "as one proceeds upwards to the next @xmath9 bin the correlation is offset by + 0.05 .",
    "this is added to the correlation of each subsequent @xmath9 bin .",
    "the smallest @xmath9 bin on top of fig .",
    "8 has a + 0.2 offset .",
    "a solid straight horizontal line shows the offset for each @xmath9 bin .",
    "each solid straight horizontal line is at 1.0 in correlation strength .",
    "we see that the away side correlation in the @xmath12 region greater than about @xmath26 is larger for the random case .",
    "particles which come from bubbles that satisfy the trigger ( 3.0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 4.0",
    "gev / c ) are harder and have a different @xmath2 distribution compared to the case without trigger requirements . in a given",

    "<S> in an earlier paper we developed a parton bubble model ( pbm ) for rhic , high - energy heavy - ion collisions . pbm was based on a substructure of a ring of localized bubbles ( gluonic hot spots ) which initially contain 3 - 4 partons composed of almost entirely gluons . </S>",
    "<S> the bubble ring was perpendicular to the collider beam direction , centered on the beam , at midrapidity , and located on the expanding fireball surface of au au central collisions ( 0 - 10% ) at @xmath0=200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the bubbles emitted correlated particles at kinetic freezeout , leading to a lumpy fireball surface . for a selection of charged particles ( 0.8 gev / c </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 4.0 gev / c ) , the pbm reasonably quantitatively ( within a few percent ) explained high precision rhic experimental correlation analyses in a manner which was consistent with the small observed hbt source size in this transverse momentum range . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that surface emission from a distributed set of surface sources ( as in the pbm ) was necessary to obtain this consistency . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give a review of the above comparison to central au au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the bubble formation can be associated with gluonic objects predicted by a glasma flux tube model ( gftm ) that formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane of two colliding sheets of color glass condensate ( cgc ) , which pass through one another . </S>",
    "<S> these sheets create boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> a blast wave gives the tubes near the surface transverse flow in the same way it gave transverse flow to the bubbles in the pbm . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the equivalent characteristics of the pbm and gftm and connect the two models . </S>",
    "<S> in the gftm the longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields have a non - zero topological charge density @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these fields cause a local strong cp violation which effects charged particle production coming from quarks and anti - quarks created in the tube or bubble .    </S>",
