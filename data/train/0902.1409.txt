    "throughout this paper we consider a possible blow up for a model from surface growth .",
    "our main motivation is to carry over the program developed for 3d - navier stokes to this equation , in order to study the possible blow up of solutions .",
    "this paper is the starting point focusing mainly on hilbert space theory .",
    "details on the model can be found in raible et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite or siegert & plischke @xcite . in its simplest version ,",
    "it is given by @xmath0 subject to periodic boundary conditions on @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 .",
    "although the surface is not periodic , these boundary conditions together with the assumption of a moving frame are the standard conditions in models of this type .",
    "sometimes the model has been considered also on the whole real line without decay condition at infinity , even though we do not examine this case here .    from a mathematical point of view",
    "neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions are quite similar for the problem studied here .",
    "the key point ensured by any of these boundary conditions is that there is a suitable cancellation in the non - linearity , namely @xmath3 which is the main ( and probably only ) ingredient to derive useful a - priori estimates .",
    "the main terms in the equation are the dominant linear operator , and the quadratic non - linearity .",
    "sometimes the equation is considered with a linear instability @xmath4 , which leads to the formation of hills , and the kuramoto - shivashinky - type nonlinearity @xmath5 leading to a saturation in the coarsening of hills .",
    "both terms are neglected here .",
    "they are lower order terms not important for questions regarding regularity and blow up",
    ". moreover , the presence of these terms complicates calculations significantly ( cf . @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the equation is usually perturbed by space - time white noise ( see for instance  @xcite ) , which we also neglect here , although many results do hold for the stochastic pde also .",
    "for general surveys on surface growth processes and molecular beam epitaxy see barabsi & stanley @xcite or halpin - healy & zhang @xcite .",
    "there are two standard ways of treating the existence of solutions .",
    "the first one relies on the spectral galerkin method and shows energy type estimates for the approximation , which by some compactness arguments ensure the convergence of a subsequence .",
    "see @xcite , or for the stochastically perturbed equation @xcite . in all cases",
    "initial conditions in @xmath6 ensure the existence , but not uniqueness , of global solutions .",
    "the second way uses fixed point arguments to show local uniqueness and regularity using the mild formulation .",
    "see @xcite , which could not treat the optimal case . in section [",
    "s : critical ] we give a local existence , which is optimal in the sense that initial conditions are in a critical space .",
    "we also establish uniqueness among mild solutions and , less trivially , among weak solutions . for these smooth local solutions we can easily show energy estimates , and discuss possible singularities and blow - up .",
    "standard arguments assure uniqueness of global solutions using a fixed point argument in @xmath7,h^1)$ ] for sufficiently small regular data in @xmath8 .",
    "we can even go below that for uniqueness of solutions in @xmath9 for any @xmath10 .",
    "this improves results of  @xcite .",
    "but we are still not able to prove uniqueness of global solutions without smallness condition on the initial data .",
    "nevertheless , we can give easily several conditions that imply uniqueness of global solutions .",
    "all of them assume regularity in critical spaces or more regularity ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : reg ] ) .    in section [ sec : blowup ] we study possible singularities and blow up . based on energy - type estimates , we establish leray - type estimates for lower bound on blow - up in terms of @xmath9-norms . moreover , we study an upper bound on the hausdorff - dimension set of singularities in time , and show that a blow - up to @xmath11 is more likely .    all results for regularity and leray - type estimates",
    "are based on energy estimates .",
    "these are optimal in the sense that they hold also hold for complex valued solutions . furthermore ,",
    "using the ideas of @xcite , @xcite , one should be able to construct a complex valued solution with strictly positive fourier coefficients that actually blows up in finite time .",
    "this is the subject of a work in progress .",
    "this would show that results based on energy - estimates are useful to describe a possible blow - up , but they alone will never be able to rule it out .",
    "we outline the standard idea for energy estimates , which is to our knowledge the only useful idea for this equation .",
    "if we formally multiply the equation by @xmath12 and integrate with respect to @xmath13 , then we obtain using ( [ e : key ] ) , @xmath14 thus , using poincare inequality , @xmath15 as explained before this estimate is only valid for smooth local solutions , or one could use spectral galerkin approximation to verify it for global solutions . note that this regularity is lower than critical regularity .",
    "it is enough for existence of solutions , but not sufficient for uniqueness .",
    "we can prove another a - priori estimate either for smooth local solutions or via spectral galerkin approximations , @xmath16 thus , for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with some more effort ( cf .",
    "stein - winkler @xcite ) , one knows that these terms are bounded independently of @xmath20 for large @xmath21 .",
    "the positive part @xmath22 now has much more regularity than the negative part @xmath23 , so a possible blow up seems to be more likely to @xmath11 than to @xmath24 .",
    "we will illustrate this in subsection [ ss : negblow ] .",
    "but unfortunately , this is still not sufficient regularity for uniqueness of solutions .    .",
    "the hills look like parabola with sharp valleys in between . ]",
    "prior to the details on some regularity criteria for equation , we introduce the _ scaling heuristic _ which explains the formulae that relate the different exponents in the results of the paper .",
    "an account on the scaling heuristic for the navier - stokes equations can be found for example in cannone @xcite , such argument are on the ground of the celebrated result on partial regularity for navier - stokes of caffarelli , kohn & nirenberg @xcite . a recent paper by tao @xcite discusses the scaling heuristic in the framework of dispersive pde .",
    "the rationale behind the method is the following .",
    "first , notice that the equations are invariant for the scaling transformation @xmath25 if @xmath26 is a functional space for @xmath12 ( for example @xmath27 ) , we can consider how the norm of @xmath26 scales with respect to the transformation above .",
    "say the following relation holds , @xmath28 we have the three cases    1 .   _ sub - critical _ case for @xmath29 , 2 .   _ critical _ case for @xmath30 , 3 .",
    "_ super - critical _ case for @xmath31 .",
    "the super - critical case corresponds to small - scales behaviour and is related to low regularity , typically to topologies where possibly existence can be proved , but no regularity or uniqueness .",
    "for example , one gets @xmath32 ( hence , super - critical ) for @xmath33 or @xmath34 , which are the spaces where existence of global weak solutions can be proved .",
    "the general scheme is the following .",
    "consider spaces @xmath26 ( depending on the space variable ) and @xmath35 ( depending on both variables , with @xmath21 up to @xmath36 ) , then in order to have a regularity criterion based on @xmath35 , the following statements must hold ,    1 .   there is a unique local solution for every initial condition in @xmath26 , 2 .",
    "the unique local solution provided by ( 1 ) is regular , 3 .   the solution from ( 1 )",
    "can be continued up to time @xmath37 , as long as its norm in @xmath35 stays bounded .",
    "the above analysis has been extensively carried on by a large number of authors for the three dimensional navier - stokes equations ( see for examples references in cannone  @xcite ) .",
    "the first paper dealing with such aims were prodi  @xcite and serrin  @xcite , see also beale , kato & majda  @xcite .",
    "we shall mainly work in the hierarchy of sobolev spaces of hilbert type .",
    "since the equations are considered on @xmath1 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions and zero space average , we shall use the following homogeneous fractional sobolev spaces .",
    "for @xmath31 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 fourier coefficient , and @xmath41 .",
    "we shall consider the norm on @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 on @xmath42 .",
    "we also use the space @xmath44 with norm @xmath45 for the lebesgue space of functions with integrable @xmath46-th power , the space @xmath47 with norm @xmath48 for the sobolev space , where the @xmath49-th derivative is in @xmath44 , and the space @xmath50 of @xmath49-time continuously differentiable functions with the supremum - norm .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of existence and uniqueness in the critical space @xmath51 , which improves significantly some results of blmker & gugg @xcite .",
    "here we shall follow the results of fujita & kato  @xcite on the navier - stokes equations with initial conditions in the critical sobolev hilbert space .",
    "this is optimal in the sense that local existence and uniqueness with lower regularity should imply uniqueness by rescaling .",

    "indeed , @xmath12 can be discontinuous in the maximal time @xmath77 , so either @xmath80 is unbounded , or is bounded and discontinuous in @xmath77 .",
