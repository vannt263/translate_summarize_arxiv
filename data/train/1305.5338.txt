    "axion  @xcite is a scalar particle predicted in peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite which is a natural solution to the strong cp problem in qcd . in the pq mechanism",
    "there exits a compelex scalar field with global @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath7 symmetry is spontaneously broken at some scale @xmath8 and axion is a nambu - goldstone boson associated with it .",
    "the axion is also attractive in cosmology because the coherent oscillation of the axion field behaves like the nonrelativistic fluid and can be a good candidate for the dark matter of the universe  @xcite .    in the cosmological scenario , however , the axion models cause the domain wall problem  @xcite .",
    "when the cosmic temperature falls to the symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 , @xmath7 symmetry is spontaneously broken , which leads to formation of one - dimensional topological defects called axionic strings .",
    "furthermore , when the cosmic temperature cools down as low as the qcd scale , the axion potential is lifted up through the qcd instanton effect and the axion acquires its mass . since the axion potential has @xmath9 ( @xmath9",
    "is called domain wall number ) desecrate minima and the axion field settles down to one of the minima , domain walls are formed so that @xmath9 domain walls attach each string .",
    "@xmath9 is determined by qcd anomaly and it depends on details of axion models .",
    "for example , @xmath10 is the number of heavy quarks which have @xmath7 charge in the ksvz model  @xcite , while it is double of the number of generations , i.e. @xmath11 , in the dfsz model  @xcite .",
    "it is known that stable domain walls are disastrous in cosmology because they dominate the universe soon after their formation and overclose the universe , which contradicts the present observations .",
    "there are a few solutions to the domain wall problem .",
    "one is the @xmath12 model which can be realized in the ksvz model .",
    "the domain walls with @xmath12 are disk - like objects whose boundaries are strings and they collapse by their tension  @xcite .",
    "thus , string - wall networks with @xmath12 are unstable . in this case ,",
    "domain walls decay into axion particles soon after their formation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spectrum of axions radiated from strings and domain walls is calculated numerically and it was found that the axion decay constant @xmath13 , which is related with the pq breaking scale as @xmath14 , should satisfy @xmath15 in order that the axion abundance does not exceed the dark matter abundance . another solution for @xmath16 is to postulate the bias parameter which breaks the pq symmetry explicitly  @xcite . due to the bias ,",
    "the degeneracy of the potential minimum is resolved and domain walls become unstable .",
    "however , this bias also shifts the minimum of the axion potential and hence violates cp . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the phase of the bias parameter needs to be fine - tuned in order to satisfy the constraint from cp violation as well as cosmological and astrophysical constraints .",
    "the above arguments apply to the case where the pq symmetry breaking occurs after inflation . assuming that the pq symmetry is spontaneously broken before or during inflation",
    ", the domain wall problem is expected to be solved for the general domain number @xmath10 because the exponential cosmic expansion during inflation makes the value of the axion field homogeneous in the whole observable universe .",
    "breaking scale is larger than the reheating temperature in order that the @xmath7 symmetry is not restored thermally after inflation .",
    "] however , the axion field obtains fluctuation @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the hubble parameter during inflation , which leads to large isocurvature density perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the isocurvature density perturbations are stringently constrained by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the pq symmetry breaking takes place during or before inflation , we have another cosmological difficulty , i.e. , isocurvature perturbation problem . in particular , this problem is serious for the chaotic inflation model  @xcite because of its large hubble parameter during inflation and the axion model may be inconsistent with chaotic inflation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , linde proposed that the large expectation value in the radial direction of the pq field during inflation can suppress the isocurvature perturbations and it can avoid the domain wall problem simultaneously .",
    "after inflation , though , the large fluctuations of the pq field are generated by the parametric resonance  @xcite and they can lead to nonthermal restoration of the @xmath7 symmetry  @xcite . then , stable axionic strings are formed at the subsequent @xmath7 symmetry breaking and eventually the domain wall problem comes again after the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the formation of the stable strings with the nonthermal symmetry restoration was calculated using lattice simulations in the radiation dominated background after chaotic inflation with quartic potential in ref .",
    "it was found that the @xmath7 symmetry breaking scale must satisfy @xmath19 in order that the stable axionic strings which lead to the domain wall problem are not formed .. ] in this paper , we reexamine the formation of the axionic strings in linde s model using lattice simulation .",
    "we assume that the universe is matter dominated after inflation in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , which is natural when the inflaton oscillates along the quadratic potential .",
    "we find that the constraint on the pq breaking scale is much relaxed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents the initial value of the pq field .",
    "together with observational constrains , it is found that chaotic inflation is consistent with the axion model if the initial misalignment angle @xmath0 is less than @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we find that axion can be dark matter without the isocurvature perturbation problem nor the domain wall problem for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in general inflation models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : observational constraints ] describes the observational constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we summaries our conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us consider an inflaton field @xmath22 and a complex pq field @xmath23 with the potential @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the inflaton , @xmath26 is a self - coupling constant of the pq field and @xmath8 is the breaking scale of @xmath7 symmetry . here ,",
    "for concreteness we consider the chaotic inflation model and the inflaton has a value larger than planck scale during inflation .",
    "we assume that the value in the radial direction of the pq field during inflation is large enough to satisfy the observational constraint on isocurvature perturbations .",
    "when the pq field satisfies the slow - roll condition , it follows the attractor solution given by  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the inflaton value when the inflaton escapes from the stochastic region , given by @xmath29 in the chaotic inflation model , the field value of the inflaton corresponding to e - folding number @xmath30 is @xmath31 and the inflation ends at @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : attractor solution ] ) and ( [ eq : initial inflaton ] ) we obtain @xmath33 . namely , the pq field hardly move during inflation .    after inflation",
    "the universe is dominated by the oscillation of the inflaton .",
    "since the effective mass of the pq field in the radial direction is @xmath34 at the end of inflation , the pq field starts to oscillate soon after inflation .",
    "when the amplitude of the pq field is much larger than @xmath8 , the potentail of the pq field is approximately quartic and the amplitude of the pq field oscillation decreases as @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the scale factor @xmath36 when the pq field settles down to the minimum of its potential is estimated as @xmath37 where the subscript @xmath38 represents the initial time at the beginning of oscillation .",
    "hereafter we adopt the normalization as @xmath39 .",
    "until the homogeneous mode of the pq field settles down to the potential minimum , the fluctuations of the pq field grow exponentially through the parametric resonance .",
    "if the amplitude of the fluctuations @xmath40 become larger than @xmath8 , the effective potential is lifted up and the pq symmetry is restored nonthermally .",
    "after that , the fluctuations decrease by the cosmic expansion , @xmath7 symmetry is spontaneously broken again and stable cosmic strings which lead to the domain wall formation may eventually be formed .",
    "we perform lattice simulations and examine whether stable cosmic strings are formed or not . before showing the results of the numerical simulations ,",
    "let us estimate the order of the pq scale @xmath8 for strings not to be formed .",
    "we define two real scalar fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and these two fields can be decomposed into their homogeneous parts and fluctuations as @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the initial conditioins @xmath45 .",
    "when the amplitude of @xmath46 is much larger than @xmath8 , the time evolution of @xmath46 is approximately given by  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the conformal time and @xmath49 is a constant . unlike the radiation dominated universe in  @xcite .",
    "we neglect this term in the analytical estimation for simplicity . ]",
    "the linearized equations of motion of the fluctuations in fourier space are @xmath50 rescaling as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , eqs . and become mathieu equation : @xmath54\\delta x_{k}&\\simeq&0 ,     \\label{eq : real mathieu}\\\\     \\frac{d^2\\delta y_{k}}{dz^2}+\\left[a_{y}+2q_{y}\\cos2z\\right]\\delta y_{k}&\\simeq&0 ,     \\label{eq : imaginary mathieu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 here we have neglected the term which contains the decreasing factor @xmath56 for simplicity . from eq . and @xmath57 , @xmath58 is larger than unity for any momentum , on the other hand @xmath59 can be unity for an appropriate momentum .",
    "therefore the parametric resonance occurs in the first instability band for @xmath60 , but it occurs in the second instability band for @xmath61",
    ". since the resonance of @xmath60 is stronger than that of @xmath61 , the growth of the fluctuations of the imaginary part of the pq field is faster than that of the real part .",
    "this is also understood from the fact that there is no potential in the imaginary direction . neglecting the fluctuations of the real part @xmath62 for the above reason",
    ", the amplitude of the field fluctuations is estimated as @xmath63 assuming that the initial condition for the fluctuations is the flat spectrum @xmath64 which is generated during inflation , and that the first instability band dominates the momentum integration , we have @xmath65 where the typical momentum and the width in the first instability band are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the growth rate of @xmath60 in the first instability band is @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the initial conformal time is @xmath69 and the conformal time when the homogeneous mode settles down into the minimum of its potential is @xmath70 from eq . since @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the matter dominated universe . from eq .",

    "the strength of resonance @xmath76 is constant .",
    "since the hubble parameter during the chaotic inflation is @xmath77 , the above condition is @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations in the next section show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : analytic condition ] ) slightly overestimates the condition because the back reaction is not taken into account .",
    "the condition  ( [ eq : analytic condition ] ) and the result obtained in the next section is much weaker than that given in  @xcite where the universe is radiation dominated after inflation . since the scale factor @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath85 in the radiation dominated universe , the pq field oscillates @xmath86 times until it settles down to the potential minimum , which should be compared with @xmath87 in the case of the matter dominated universe .",
    "thus , the parametric resonance is more significant for the case considered in  @xcite and the more strong condition is obtained .",
    "in order to study the precise evolution of the pq field after inflation , we have performed the lattice simulation in two dimensions . from eq .",

    "strings are temporally formed and disappear soon after the homogeneous part settles , which does not lead to formation of the domain walls .",
    "thus , in this paper , adopting the criterion in  @xcite we judge stable strings are formed if strings per horizon remains almost constant . from this criterion ,",

    "@xcite because it assumed the radiation dominated universe where the parametric resonance is more significant as shown in section  [ sec : the dynamics of the fields ] . combining our numerical result with the observational constraints from the matter density of the universe and the cdm isocurvature perturbations",
    ", it is found that the axion model is consistent with chaotic inflation if the initial misalignment angle @xmath159 is less than @xmath1 . in this case",
    "axions can not be the main component of dark matter in the chaotic inflation model with hubble parameter @xmath77 .",
    "however , when we consider general inflation models axion can account for the dark matter without the domain wall problem nor isocurvature perturbation problem for @xmath2 and @xmath160 .",
    "this implies that topological inflation model  @xcite is marginally allowed since the hubble parameter during inflation is estimated as @xmath161@xcite .",
