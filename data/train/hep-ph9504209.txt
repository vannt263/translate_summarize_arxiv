    "one obvious reason is that the simultaneous study of the different distribution asymmetries provides a handle on the possible @xmath0 odd biases of a detector .",

    "the interaction with the photon does not contribute to the process we study , but is important for @xmath91 .    in order to generate a @xmath0-odd triple product correlation , we need interference between the different diagrams that give rise to each parton subprocess",
