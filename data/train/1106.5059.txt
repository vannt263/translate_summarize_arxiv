    "will we discover primordial tensor modes in the cmb ?",
    "the existence of a large - scale spectrum of tensor perturbations is widely considered to be indicative of an early period of inflation  a `` smoking gun '' signature of quasi - de sitter expansion ; however , inflation is not the only source @xcite .",
    "alternative theories of the origin of structure , like string gas cosmology or bouncing universe models , are capable of generating b - modes , as are topological defects @xcite and bubble collisions from phase transitions @xcite occurring after the big bang .",
    "these latter two sources have the potential to obscure or confuse the signal from inflation or its alternatives , but future observations should be able to disentangle the sources if the primordial signal is large enough @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate how well the different _ primordial _ sources of tensor modes  inflation , string gases , or bounces  can be resolved and supported .",
    "the tensor perturbation spectrum is typically modeled as a power law in comoving wavenumber , @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the tensor spectral index . in slow roll inflation",
    "the amplitude of tensors is determined by the hubble parameter , @xmath9 , which , together with @xmath10 in the friedmann universe , furnishes the hallmark prediction of a red spectrum : @xmath11 .",
    "meanwhile , the spectrum of metric fluctuations that arises from a string gas in the early universe is characterized by @xmath12 in the string frame @xcite , due to the growth of anisotropic stress as the radiation dominated phase is approached .",
    "a blue spectrum can also be generated during a phase of so - called superinflation @xcite , motivated , for example , by loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "yet a different picture emerges from fluctuations produced during the contracting phase of a bouncing cosmology : a matter dominated contraction with a regular bounce gives a scale invariant spectrum in the expanding radiation dominated phase @xcite . evidently , the _ sign _ of @xmath8 is a more likely indicator of inflation than the mere presence of tensors . but",
    "how large must this tilt be in order for current and future probes to detect it with confidence ?",
    "the basic question that we seek to answer in this work is how far @xmath8 must deviate from zero before one can confidently conclude @xmath4 . from the point of view of sampling statistics , this is a straightforward hypothesis test : how large must @xmath8 be in order to reject the null hypothesis , @xmath13 ?",
    "having analyzed data , @xmath14 , one determines whether the best fit value , @xmath15 , is a sufficient number of standard deviations , @xmath16 , away from @xmath17 to satisfy the chosen significance level , @xmath18 .",

    "the accepted approach to this problem is to apply bayesian inference to the space of competing models . as a definition of _ model _ , we should have in mind a collection of parameters , @xmath27 , with associated prior probabilities @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "here we have two models : @xmath31 corresponds to the null hypothesis in which @xmath17 , and @xmath32 contains @xmath8 as a parameter free to vary across some prior range , @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "bayesian analysis gives preference to the least complex model that best fits the data @xcite .",
    "models with many parameters free to vary across large prior ranges , @xmath34 , are considered more complex than models with fewer parameters and more restrictive priors .",
    "bayesian selection prefers models that are _ predictive _ : the prior and posterior parameter widths should be comparable .",

    ", we do not solely examine how well future probes might constrain @xmath8 , an analysis carried out in detail by others @xcite ; we are instead interested in going one step further , and determining whether or not , given these constraints , we are warranted in including @xmath8 as a free parameter . in the next section ,",
    "we develop the framework for performing bayesian model comparison forecasts for future experiments , following closely the approach taken by @xcite and @xcite to investigate the tilt of the scalar spectrum and the curvature of the universe , respectively .",
    "methods of bayesian inference can be applied to the problem of model selection in a manner fully consistent with probability theory .",
    "given a model , @xmath37 , and a dataset , * d * , bayes theorem gives @xmath38 where the quantity @xmath39 is the posterior probability of the model @xmath37 , and @xmath40 is the _ evidence _ for model @xmath37 .",
    "one typically assigns equal prior probabilities @xmath41 to the alternative models , and @xmath42 is independent of the model .",
    "if we again apply bayes theorem , @xmath43 we obtain the posterior probability of the parameters @xmath44 given * d*. the term @xmath45 is a function of both the parameter values and the data ; for a given dataset , it is commonly called the likelihood of the parameters , @xmath46 . the evidence from eq .",
    "( [ evidence ] ) is nothing more than a normalization constant for eq .",
    "( [ bayes ] ) , @xmath47 this expression defines the evidence to be the prior - weighted average of the likelihood over the parameter space .    for the sake of illustration ,",
    "assume that the parameter @xmath48 is well constrained by some data , * d * , so that the posterior probability @xmath49 is well - peaked within the prior range , @xmath50\\frac{1}{\\delta \\theta_j},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a step function that enforces the prior range and we have chosen a _ flat _ prior on @xmath48 ,",

    "since the posterior distribution is well - peaked , we can approximate the integral eq .",
    "( [ evidence2 ] ) using laplace s method with eq .",
    "( [ bayes ] ) : we simply multiply the height of the un - normalized posterior ( the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ bayes ] ) ) , @xmath53 , by its width , @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the point of maximum likelihood . in terms of the likelihood function",
    "this becomes , @xmath57 while only an approximation , this expression nicely reveals the essential ingredients of bayesian model selection : a high - valued maximum likelihood clearly increases the evidence in favor of the model , while the _ occam factor _ , @xmath58 , penalizes overly complex or poorly predictive models .",
    "models with a prior volume much larger than the posterior volume , @xmath59 , are not considered predictive because they can accommodate a wide range of parameter values before the data is collected .",
    "complex models with loose priors and many free parameters that are well - constrained by the data are therefore penalized by the occam factor , and will consequently have lower evidence than a simpler , more predictive model that fits the data equally well .",
    "we are now ready to do model selection : we simply compute the bayesian evidence for each model and compare .",
    "given two competing models , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , this can be done via the bayes factor , @xmath60 a rubric for scoring the significance of a model is given by the well - known jeffreys scale @xcite . the scale rates : @xmath61 ( indecisive ) , @xmath62 ( substantial ) , @xmath63 ( strong ) , and @xmath64 ( decisive ) , with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) favoring @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . in this work",
