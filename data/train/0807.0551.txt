    "in the companion paper@xcite to this work , referred to as paper i , we detailed the existence of a strong correlation between the configurational parts of pressure and energy in several model liquids .",
    "recall that ( instantaneous ) pressure @xmath0 and energy @xmath1 have contributions both from particle momenta and positions:@xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the kinetic and potential energies , respectively , and @xmath5 is the `` kinetic temperature'',@xcite proportional to the kinetic energy per particle .",
    "the configurational contribution to pressure is the virial @xmath6 , which for a translationally invariant potential energy function @xmath4 is defined@xcite by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the position of the @xmath9th particle .",
    "note that @xmath6 has dimension energy . in the case of a pair potential @xmath10 the expression for the virial becomes@xcite    @xmath11    where @xmath12 .",
    "it is the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath6 that we are interested in , quantified by the correlation coefficient    @xmath13    paper i documented the correlation in many systems , showing that this is often quite strong , with correlation coefficient @xmath14 , while in some other cases it was found to be weak or almost non - existent .",
    "the latter included in particular models with additional significant coulombic interactions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first we give a comprehensive analysis of the source of the correlation in the simplest `` strongly correlating '' model liquid , the standard single - component lennard - jones ( sclj ) fluid .",
    "paper i presented briefly an explanation in terms of an effective inverse power - law potential . here",
    "we elaborate on that in greater detail , and go beyond it .",
    "secondly we discuss a few observable consequences and applications of the strong correlations . these range from their measurement in a real system to applications to systems as diverse as supercooled liquids and biomembranes .",
    "in section  [ analysis ] we present a detailed analysis for the sclj case , first in terms of an effective inverse power - law with exponent @xmath15 .",
    "this accounts for the correlation at the level of individual pair - encounters by assuming that only the repulsive part of the potential , corresponding to distances less than the minimum of the potential @xmath16 , is relevant for fluctuations , and that this may be well approximated by an inverse power - law .",
    "the value 18 is significant since this explains the `` slope '' @xmath17 defined as    @xmath18    observed to be @xmath19 for lennard - jones systems ( paper i ) .",
    "the slope is exactly @xmath20 for a pure inverse power - law potential with exponent @xmath21 , a case with perfect @xmath22 correlation ( paper i ) .",
    "section  [ analysis ] continues with a discussion of the sclj crystal , which is also strongly correlating .",
    "this would seem to invalidate the dominance of the repulsive part , since only presumably distances around and beyond the potential minimum are important , at least at low and moderate pressure . in this case",
    "the correlation can be explained only when summation over all pairs is taken into account , thus the correlation emerges as a collective effect .",
    "there is a connection between the slope obtained in this way and that given by the effective inverse power - law ; in fact they are quite similar .",
    "the third subsection in section  [ analysis ] gives a more systematic analysis of which regions dominate the fluctuations in the liquid phase , using an eigenvector decomposition of the spatially - resolved covariance matrix .",
    "this matrix represents the contributions to the ( co-)variances of potential energy and virial from different pair separations .",
    "it is demonstrated that the region around the minimum of the potential plays a substantial role .",
    "the final subsection in section  [ analysis ] provides a synthesis of the insights from the previous subsections , resulting in an `` extended effective power - law approximation '' , which includes a linear term .",
    "the main point is that a linear term in the pair potential will contribute to the mean values , but not to fluctuations , of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , if the volume is constant .    in section  [ consequences ]",
    "we discuss some consequences , starting by considering whether the instantaneous correlations can be related to a measurable quantity in the normal liquid state , and demonstrating this with data for supercritical argon , finding a correlation coefficient of 0.96 .",
    "next we focus on consequences for highly viscous liquids , where time - scale separation implies that instantaneous correlation between virial and potential energy can be related to a correlation between the time - averaged pressure and energy .",
    "the third subsection discusses consequences for aging , while the fourth briefly discusses connections with recent work by heimburg and jackson on biomembranes .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] concludes with an outlook reflecting on the broader significance of strong correlation , and its implications for the understanding of liquids , particularly in the context of viscous liquids ( which has been our main motivation throughout this work ) .",
    "in this section we consider the sclj system , in the hope that it is simple enough that a fairly complete understanding of the cause of strong correlations is possible .",
    "recall that @xmath14 for a wide range of states ( paper i ) . in order to understand the numerology better we consider a generalized lennard - jones potential , denoted lj(a , b ) ( @xmath23 ) :    @xmath24    although the standard lj(12,6 ) case will be used for most examples .",
    "starting from the idea that short distances dominate fluctuations and that the observed correlations are suggestive of a power - law interaction , we show that at a given density , the lennard - jones potential may be approximated by a single effective inverse power law over a range from a little less than @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 changes sign ) to around @xmath16 , the location of the potential minimum ( @xmath27 for lj(12,6 ) ) , covering an energy range of approximately @xmath28 to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the well - depth . at first sight",
    ", one might expect that if this were at all the case , the effective power would be less than @xmath31 , somehow a mixture of the two exponents @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it was noticed by ben - amotz and stell,@xcite however , that the repulsive core of the lj(12,6 ) potential may approximated by an inverse power law with an exponent @xmath3318 , in agreement with our data ( paper i ) . to see how we get an exponent greater than @xmath31 , note that the exponent @xmath21 in an inverse power law can be extracted from different ratios of derivatives :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "this implies that    @xmath36    since successive differentiation gives factors of @xmath21 , then @xmath37 , etc . for a potential @xmath38 which is not an inverse power law ,",
    "these expressions provide different definitions of a local effective power - law exponent ( assuming @xmath39 as @xmath40 ) :    @xmath41    a plot of the first four of these is shown in fig .",
    "[ differentorderns ] for lj(12,6 ) .",
    "all converge to @xmath42 at short @xmath43 , as they must .",
    "all increase with increasing @xmath43 until the denominator vanishes , but more slowly , the higher the order @xmath0 . in particular , when @xmath44 diverges it is straightforward algebra to show that @xmath45 has the value @xmath46 .",
    "so @xmath47 diverges at @xmath48 where the potential is zero , and is therefore unsuitable for characterizing the range which we expect to dominate the fluctuations , from energy @xmath49 to energy @xmath28 ( it is also sensitive to the presence of an additive constant , unlike the others ) .",
    "instead we use @xmath50 , which at @xmath48 ( the zero of @xmath51 and the divergence of @xmath47 ) takes the value @xmath52 , or 18 for the lj(12,6 ) . taking the factor 3 in the denominator of the virial into account , this would explain the slope @xmath336 observed in the simulations ( paper i ) .",
    "but first we should see how well an inverse power law with this exponent actually fits the lennard - jones potential .",
    "we denote the point matching point @xmath53 . with the exponent fixed ,",
    "we are free to choose the multiplicative constant @xmath54 and the additive one @xmath35 to match the slope and value at @xmath55 ; the resulting expression is @xmath56 .",

    "note that what are actually plotted are the deviations from the respective mean values  the means @xmath94 and @xmath95 , for example , do not coincide .",
    "but the fluctuations are clearly highly correlated , and the data lie quite close to the blue dashed lines , marking slope unity . specifically , the correlation coefficients are 0.946 for the potential energy and 0.984 for the virial",
    ". we can also check how much of the variance of @xmath96 is accounted for by @xmath73 , @xmath97 , and similarly for @xmath6 .",
    "this is a sensible quantity because the pl and diff parts are almost uncorrelated for the choice @xmath98 ( cross terms account for less than 1% of the total variance in each case ) .",
    "we find 92% for @xmath4 and 95% for @xmath6 .",
    "thus we see that the power law gives to a quite good approximation the fluctuations of @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "the correlation follows from this with @xmath17 given by one third of the effective inverse power - law exponent , or 6.4 for this state point .",
    "the measured slope ( eq .  ( [ gamma_defined ] ) ) was 6.3 corresponding to an effective exponent 18.9 , about 2% smaller than the 19.3 . a simpler way to determine",
    "the exponent would be three times the slope , although for some applications it could be advantageous to optimize the fit as described here .",
    "we turn our attention now to the fact that the correlation persists even for the crystallized samples ( seen in paper i in the lower left part of fig .  4 and in fig .",
    "this is not trivial , because the physics of solids , both crystalline and amorphous systems , is generally dominated by fluctuations about mechanically stable structures , and therefore presumably ( except perhaps at very high pressure ) by the form of the potential near its minimum @xmath16 , i.e. , including distances larger than the minimum .",
    "thus the idea of the effective inverse power law would seem to be inappropriate here  in particular since the effective exponent @xmath50 diverges at @xmath16and there is apparently no reason why one should get a correlation as strong as in the liquid and with so similar a slope .",
    "in fact there is an interval of @xmath43 between @xmath16 and the minimum of the pair virial @xmath99 where @xmath38 is increasing and @xmath99 is decreasing , which would lead if anything to a negative correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath4 , when considering individual pair interactions .",
    "moreover , one would expect that a harmonic approximation of the potential near the ground - state configuration would be an accurate representation of the dynamics in the low - temperature limit , but as we will see , the harmonic approximation actually implies negative @xmath22 correlation , which is not observed . in this subsection",
    "we show why the strong positive correlation persists , and why the slope @xmath17 changes little going from liquid to crystal ( at constant volume ) . although the classical dynamics of a crystal is apparently of little importance , since in reality quantum effects dominate , it turns out to be very instructive to consider the low - temperature ( @xmath100 ) classical limit , since what we find has significance also in the liquid phase ( subsection  [ fluctuationmodes ] ) .",
    "the key ideas are ( 1 ) that the positive correlation emerges only after summing over all interactions  it is therefore a collective effect , rather than a single - pair effect , and ( 2 ) the constraint of fixed volume  it is important to recall from paper i that the virial - potential - energy correlation only appears under fixed - volume conditions ; different volumes give approximately the same slope but different offsets ( fig .  4 in paper i ) .      for maximum clarity",
    "we start by considering the simplest possible case , a one - dimensional ( 1d ) crystal with periodic boundary conditions and only nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "we also suppose that the lattice spacing @xmath101 is equal to the minimum of the potential ; this assumption is not made in the subsequent treatment of the 3d crystal . in a crystal",
    "the particles stay close to their equilibrium positions .",
    "it therefore makes sense to expand the pair energy ( we have in mind a general pair potential with a single minimum ) as a taylor series , leaving out constant terms but keeping third order terms :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the distance between particles @xmath9 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the @xmath0-th derivative of the pair potential at @xmath67 , and we introduce the notation    @xmath106    the virial is    @xmath107    which , by writing @xmath108 , can be rewritten as    @xmath109    note that @xmath4 involves @xmath110 and @xmath111 while @xmath6 also has a first - order term with @xmath112 .",
    "evaluating the sum @xmath112 is very simple : @xmath103 can be expressed in terms of displacements from the equilibrium positions @xmath113 as @xmath114 , giving for @xmath112    @xmath115    such a sum of consecutive relative displacements gives the change in separation of the two end particles .",
    "but the total sum must vanish , because by periodic boundary conditions the `` end particles '' are the same particle ( it does nt matter which one ) , therefore @xmath116 .",
    "in fact periodic boundary conditions are not necessary , only that the length is fixed . since",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath6 involve at lowest order @xmath110 , which is positive semi - definite , at sufficiently low temperature we may drop the @xmath111 terms . combining eqs .",
    "( [ u_1d ] ) and ( [ w_1d ] ) we find    @xmath117    where we have written the coefficient in terms of the @xmath118 effective power - law exponent defined in eq .",
    "( [ define_n_p ] ) . for lj(a ,",
    "b ) the coefficient evaluates to @xmath119 , which is @xmath120 for lj(12,6 ) , similar to the observed slope .",
    "this short calculation demonstrates the main point : summing over all interactions makes the first - order term in the virial vanish , and the second - order term is proportional to the second - order term in the potential energy .",
    "it is also worth noting that for a purely harmonic crystal we can take @xmath121 , in which case eq .",
    "( [ slope_1d_crystal ] ) implies that there is perfect negative correlation , with a slope of -2/3 .",
    "we now generalize this to three - dimensional crystals , which means allowing for transverse displacements .",
    "the calculation involves breaking overall sums into sums over one - dimensional chains within the crystal .",
    "we also relax the condition that the lattice constant coincides with the potential minimum , which is only realistic at low pressures .",
    "we still assume only nearest - neighbor interactions are relevant ( this will be justified in the next subsection ) .",
    "generalization to a disordered ( amorphous ) solid@xcite should be possible , since we observe the correlation to hold also in that case .",
    "the calculation would necessitate , however , some kind of disorder averaging , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "can be applied to the case of a disordered solid , explaining the high correlation also there , but it is not accurate enough to get as good an estimate for the low - temperature limit as we do our analysis of the crystal . ]",
    "we start by considering a simple cubic ( sc ) crystal of lattice constant @xmath101 , with interactions only between nearest neighbors , so that the equilibrium bond length is @xmath101 for all bonds .",
    "the fact that such a crystal is mechanically unstable is irrelevant for the calculation .",
    "we shall see later that the result applies also to , for instance , an fcc crystal .",
    "we have the same kind of expansions about @xmath122 as above for @xmath4 and @xmath6 , except a linear term is now included , since we no longer assume that @xmath123 .",

    "it is convenient to define coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 of the dimensionless quantities @xmath128 :    @xmath129    dropping the constant term @xmath130 in @xmath6 , since it plays no role for the fluctuations , we then have    @xmath131    the ratio of corresponding coefficients is given by the @xmath0th order effective inverse power - law exponent :    @xmath132    thus for in the limit of small @xmath101 , where these are all similar and close to the repulsive exponent in the potential ( fig .",

    "basic questions such as the origins of non - exponential relaxations and non - arrhenius temperature dependence are still vigorously debated in this field of research.@xcite instantaneous correlations of the kind discussed in this work would seem to be relevant only to the high frequency properties of a highly viscous liquid ; their relevance to the long time scales on which structural relaxation occurs follows from the separation of time scales as explained below .",
    "a question that is not actively debated in this research field ( but see , e.g. , refs .  ) , is whether a single parameter is enough to describe a highly viscous liquid .",
    "the consensus for more than 30 years is that with few exceptions these liquids require more than just one parameter , a conclusion scarcely surprising given their complexity .",
    "the meaning of `` having a single parameter '' can be understood as follows . following a sudden change in volume , both pressure and energy relax to their equilibrium values over a time scale of minutes or even hours , sufficiently close to the glass transition .",
    "if a single parameter governs the internal relaxation of the liquid , then both pressure and energy relax with the same time scale , and in fact the normalized relaxation functions are identical.@xcite this behavior can be expressed in the frequency domain , as a certain quantity , the dynamic prigogine - defay ratio , being equal to unity.@xcite a key feature of highly viscous liquids is the separation of time scales between the slow structural ( `` alpha '' ) relaxation ( up to of order seconds ) and the very short times ( of order picoseconds ) characterizing the vibrational motion of the molecules .",

    "similarly , the time - averaged energy equals the time - averaged potential energy plus a constant .",
    "thus the fluctuations of the time - averaged @xmath6 and @xmath4 equal the slowly fluctuating parts of pressure and energy , so these slow parts will also correlate 100% in their fluctuations . in this way we get from the non - observable quantities",

    "for example the frequency - dependent constant - volume specific heat @xmath346 is given@xcite by    @xmath347    where @xmath1 is the total energy .",

    ".,width=3 ]    the line of reasoning presented here opens for a new way of utilizing computer simulations to understand ultraviscous liquids .",
    "present - day computers are barely able to simulate one microsecond of real - time dynamics , making it difficult to predict the behavior of liquids approaching the laboratory glass transition .",
    "we find that pressure - energy correlations are almost independent of viscosity , however , which makes it possible to make predictions regarding the relaxation properties even in the second or hour range of characteristic times .",
    "thus if a glass - forming liquid at high temperatures ( low viscosity ) has very strong pressure - energy correlations ( @xmath362 ) , its eight thermoviscoelastic response functions at ultraviscous conditions may basically be expressed in terms of just one , irrespective of temperature ( or viscosity ) .",
    "we now discuss the significance of the present results for the interesting results reported in 2002 by mossa _ et al_,@xcite who studied the inherent states visited by the lewis - wahnstrm model@xcite of the glass - forming liquid orthoterphenyl ( otp ) during aging , i.e. , the approach to equilibrium .",
    "an inherent state ( is ) is a local minimum of the so - called potential energy landscape ( pel ) to which a given configuration is mapped by steepest - descent minimization.@xcite the pel formalism involves modeling the distributions and averages of properties of the is in the hope of achieving a compact description of the thermodynamics of glass - forming liquids.@xcite the thesis of ref .   and of the previous work",
    "@xcite is that an equation of state can be derived using this formalism which is valid even for non - equilibrium situations .",
    "this involves including an extra parameter , namely the average is ( potential ) energy , @xmath363 , so that the equation of state takes the form    @xmath364    where @xmath365 is the ensemble averaged inherent state pressure  for a given configuration it is the pressure of the corresponding inherent state  and @xmath366 .",
    "the usefulness of splitting in this way lies in the fact that @xmath365 does not explicitly depend on @xmath89 .    in equilibrium @xmath367",
    "is determined by @xmath78 and @xmath89 .",
    "the conclusion of ref .",
    "is that knowledge of @xmath368 in non - equilibrium situations is enough to predict the corresponding pressure ( given also @xmath89 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "this was based on extensive simulations of various aging schedules .",
    "thus the authors conclude that the inherent states visited by the system while out of equilibrium , must be in some sense the `` same '' ones sampled during equilibrium conditions .",
    "`` same '' is effectively defined by their results that averages of various inherent state properties ( @xmath78 , @xmath369 , @xmath365 , as well as a measure of the is curvature ) are all related to each other the same way under non - equilibrium conditions as under equilibrium conditions .",
    "it was similarly found that the volume could be determined from @xmath370 following a pressure jump in a pressure - controlled simulation . on the other hand , subsequent work by the same group found that this was not at all possible for glassy water during compression / decompression cycles . @xcite    now , our results ( paper i ) for the same otp model show that it is a strongly correlating liquid .",
    "thus we expect a general correlation between individual , not just average , values of @xmath365 , the inherent state pressure ( which lacks a kinetic term and therefore equals the inherent state virial divided by volume ) and @xmath369 , for a given volume .",
    "therefore , for any given collection of inherent states with the same volume  not just equilibrium ensembles  the mean values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 will fall on the same straight line as the instantaneous values .",
    "note that this would not hold if the correlation was non - linear .",
    "correspondingly for given @xmath365 , there is a general correlation between individual values of @xmath369 and @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , any two of these quantities determine the third with high accuracy , and this is true at the level of individual configurations , including inherent states .    to see how this works for cases involving fixed volume",
    ", we write the total ( instantaneous ) pressure as a sum of an inherent state part , which involves the the virial at the corresponding inherent state , plus a term involving the difference of the true virial from the inherent state virial , plus the kinetic term :    @xmath371    the first term is linearly related to the inherent state energy for a strongly correlating liquid .",
    "moreover , the difference term is similarly expressed in terms of the corresponding energy difference , @xmath372 .",
    "taking averages over the ( possibly non - equilibrium , although we assume equilibrium within a given potential energy basin ) ensemble , we expect that @xmath373 depends only on @xmath89 and @xmath78 ( a slight @xmath369 dependence can appear in @xmath17 since this is slightly state - point dependent ) .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath0 can be reconstructed from a knowledge of ( average ) @xmath369 , @xmath78 and @xmath89 , without any assumptions about the nature of the inherent states visited .",
    "in particular , no conclusion can be drawn regarding the latter .",
    "the failure of the pressure reconstruction in the case of water  @xcite is not surprising , since water models are generally not strongly correlating ( which as we saw in paper i is linked to the existence of the density maximum ) .      a completely different area of relevance for the type of correlations reported here relates to recent work of heimburg and jackson,@xcite who have proposed a controversial new theory of nerve signal propagation .",
    "based on experiment and theory they suggest that a nerve signal is not primarily electrical , but a soliton sound - wave.@xcite among other things this theory explains how anaesthesia works ( and why one can dope people with the inert gas xenon ) : anaesthesia works simply by a freezing - point depression that changes the membrane phase transition temperature and affects its ability to carry the soliton sound wave . a crucial ingredient of the theory is the postulate of proportionality between volume and enthalpy of microstates , i.e. , that their thermal equilibrium fluctuations should correlate perfectly .",
    "this should apply even through the first - order membrane _ melting _ transition .",
    "the theory was justified in part from previous experiments by heimburg showing proportionality between compressibility and specific heat through the phase transition.@xcite the postulated correlation  including the claim that is survives a first - order phase transition  fits precisely the pattern found in our liquid simulations .",

    "the time series of time - averaged , normalized @xmath1 and @xmath78 for one case are shown in fig .",
    "[ membranetimeseries ] .",
    "the necessity of time - averaging stems from the presence of water , which we know does not exhibit strong correlations .",
    "since the membrane dynamics are much slower than those of the water , they can be isolated by time averaging .",
    "in paper i and this work we have demonstrated several cases of strongly correlating liquids and some cases where the correlation is weak or absent ( at least under normal conditions of pressure and temperature ) .",
    "an important next step is to continue to document the existence or non - existence of correlations , particularly in different kinds of model systems , such as non - pair potential systems and systems with interactions computed using quantum mechanics ( e.g. , by density functional theory ) .",
    "it is noteworthy in this respect that after suitable time averaging the correlations may appear in systems where they are otherwise unexpected .",
    "one example was the square - well ( sqw ) case , where the correlation was between the time - averaged virial and potential energy . in the case of viscous liquids time",
    "averaging allowed a correlation to appear between the more accessible energy and pressure , while for the biomembranes it made it possible to remove the non strongly - correlating contributions from the water . in all cases",
    "time averaging is relevant because of a separation of time scales : the square - well system because the time scale over which the average number of neighbors changes is long compared to the time between collisions ; viscous liquids because the vibrational dynamics ( which includes the kinetic contributions ) is fast compared to the slow configurational dynamics ; biomembranes because the membrane dynamics is slow compared to those of the water .",
    "note that in this case it was necessary to consider an npt ensemble and study correlations between energy and volume , because only a part of the system is strongly correlating , and this part can not be constrained to a particular volume .",
    "it is worth noting that even with fixed volume , the correlation coefficient depends on whether the ensemble is nvt or nve , although the strongly correlating limit of @xmath384 is independent of ensemble .",
    "a point which has been mentioned , but which is worth emphasizing again , is that the replacement of the potential by an appropriate inverse power law can only reproduce the fluctuations , and not the mean - values of ( potential ) energy and virial , nor their first derivatives with respect to @xmath89 and @xmath78 .",
    "these determine the equation of state , in particular features such as the van der waals loop which are absent in a pure power - law system , even if changes in the exponent are allowed .",
    "the generalization to the extended effective inverse power - law approximation , however , allows in principle such features to be described .",
    "we are currently investigating the dependence of the parameters of the extended approximation on state point .",
    "finally , consider again viscous liquids , which are typically deeply supercooled .",
    "the most common way of classifying them involves the fragility parameter introduced by angell,@xcite related to the departure from arrhenius behavior of the temperature dependence of the viscosity .",
    "strong liquids , having the most arrhenius behavior , have traditionally been considered the easiest ones to understand , because arrhenius temperature dependence is well - understood .",
    "but it may well be that strongly correlating liquids , are in fact the simplest.@xcite the connection with the long - discussed question of whether a single - order parameter describes highly viscous liquids has been discussed briefly in subsection  [ viscousliquids ] , and is discussed further in ref .  .",
    "as an example , a direct application of the `` strongly - correlating '' property concerns diffusion in supercooled liquids .",
    "recent work by coslovich and roland @xcite has shown that the diffusion constant in viscous binary lennard - jones mixtures may be fitted by an expression @xmath385 where @xmath17 reflects the effective inverse power of the repulsive core .",
    "`` density scaling '' has also been observed experimentally.@xcite it is natural , given coslovich and roland s results , to hypothesize that the scaling exponent is connected to pressure - energy correlations , and in ref .",
    "it was conjectured that density scaling applies if and only if the liquid is strongly correlating .",
    "we have very recently studied the relationship between the two quantitatively@xcite and have found that ( 1 ) density scaling does indeed hold to the extent that the liquids are strongly correlating , and ( 2 ) the scaling exponent is given accurately by the slope @xmath17 of the correlations ( hence our use of the same symbol ) .",
    "this finding supports the conjecture that strongly correlating liquids may be simpler than liquids in general .    in summary , the property of strong correlation between the equilibrium fluctuations of virial and potential energy allows a new way to classify liquids .",
    "it is too soon to tell how fruitful this will turn out in the long term , but judging from the applications briefly presented here , it seems at least plausible that it will be quite useful ."
