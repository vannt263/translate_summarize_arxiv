    "however the first searches up to @xmath1 5 fb@xmath2 at the lhc interpreted within specific frameworks , such as constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) or minimal supergravity ( msugra ) indicate that squark and gluino masses are in excess of @xmath3 tev @xcite .    despite intense efforts over more than thirty years ,",
    "little is known from first principles about how exactly to realize or break supersymmetry . as a result one should keep an open mind as to which theoretical framework is realized in nature , if any .",
    "supersymmetry search strategies must be correspondingly re - designed if , for example , supersymmetry is realized in the absence of a conserved r parity @xcite .",
    "another major drawback of the standard model is its failure to account for neutrino oscillations  @xcite , whose discovery constitutes one of the major advances in particle physics of the last decade .",
    "an important observation is that , if supersymmetry is realized without a conserved r parity , the origin of neutrino masses and mixing may be intrinsically supersymmetric  @xcite .",
    "indeed an attractive dynamical way to generate neutrino mass at the weak scale is through non - zero vacuum expectation values of 21 singlet scalar neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the minimal effective description of r parity violation , namely brpv  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the simplest variants of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite such supersymmetric alternative has the merit of being testable in collider experiments , like the lhc  @xcite . here",
    "we analyze the lhc potential to determine the lightest neutralino properties such as mass , decay length and branching ratios , and discuss their relation to neutrino properties .",
    "the bilinear r - parity violating models are characterized by two properties : first the usual mssm r - conserving superpotential is enlarged according to  @xcite @xmath5 where there are 3 new superpotential parameters ( @xmath6 ) , one for each fermion generation   term in the mssm superpotential , the required smallness of the bilinear parameters @xmath6 could arise dynamically , through a nonzero vev , as in @xcite and/or be generated radiatively  @xcite . ] .",
    "the second modification is the addition of an extra soft term @xmath7 that depends on three soft mass parameters @xmath8 . for the sake of simplicity we considered the r - conserving soft terms as in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) .",
    "notice that the presence of the new soft interactions prevents the new bilinear terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp : brpv ] ) to be rotated away @xcite .",

    "the other two neutrino masses are generated through loop diagrams  @xcite .",
    "this model provides a good description of the observed neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "the brpv  msugra model is defined by eleven parameters @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the common gaugino mass and scalar soft susy breaking masses at the unification scale , @xmath13 is the common trilinear term , and @xmath14 is the ratio between the higgs field vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . in our analyzes the new parameters ( @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) are determined by the neutrino masses and mixings , therefore , we have only to vary the usual msugra parameters . for the sake of simplicity in what follows we fix @xmath15 gev , @xmath16 and @xmath17 and present our results in the plane @xmath18 .    due to the smallness of the neutrino masses , the brpv interactions turn out to be rather feeble , consequently the lsp has a lifetime long enough that its decay appears as a displaced vertex .",

    "in addition to these channels there is also the possibility of the neutralino decaying invisibly into three neutrinos , however , this channel reaches at most a few per - cent @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses and mixings as well as lsp decay properties are determined by the same interactions , therefore , there are connections between high energy lsp physics at the lhc and neutrino oscillation physics . for instance , the ratio between charged current decays @xmath33 is directly related to the atmospheric mixing angle @xcite , as illustrated in the right panel of figure  [ fig : correlations ] ; this relation was already considered in ref .",

    "<S> supersymmetric models with bilinear @xmath0-parity violation ( brpv ) can account for the observed neutrino masses and mixing parameters indicated by neutrino oscillation data . </S>",
    "<S> we consider minimal supergravity versions of brpv where the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> this is unstable , with a large enough decay length to be detected at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the lhc potential to determine the lsp properties , such as mass , lifetime and branching ratios , and discuss their relation to neutrino properties . </S>"
