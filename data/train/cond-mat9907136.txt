    "intrinsic josephson effects ( ije s ) in highly anisotropic high temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) such as bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 is a subject currently under intensive investigation @xcite .",
    "this is because single crystals of these materials naturally form a stack of many atomic - scale josephson junctions , i.e. , intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijj s ) and therefore strong coherence between junctions are expected .",
    "especially , if in - phase oscillation over all junctions is realized it will show superradiant properties such as remarkable increase of output power and decrease of linewidth [ 2 - 7 ] , and its realization will give a great impact on technological applications to optical communications in the near future .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we explore such superradiant conditions in josephson vortex flow states in ijj s .    in the case of the single long josephson junctions ( sljj s ) , fluxon dynamics coupled with transverse propagating josephson plasma oscillation",
    "have already been extensively investigated @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and sljj s have been employed as useful flux flow oscillators . in sljj s , the fluxons are aligned like one - dimensional chain along the junction plane and unidirectionally driven under the bias - current .",
    "this sliding motion of the fluxon chain excites the transverse propagating josepshson plasma oscillations inside the junction , and when their moving speed matches the josephson plasma mode velocity , i - v characterisitcs show a step like resonant structure , where the electromagnetic ( em ) wave radiation power becomes maximal @xcite,@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ijj s have a longitudinal propagating josephson plasma mode along the stacked direction and its dispersion relation are shown to be very different from that of the transverse mode , i.e. , the longitudinal one is almost flat while the transverse one is very dispersive .",
    "thus , ijj s can have many propagating modes with different dispersions as mixtures between transverse and longitudinal modes , and ijj systems with finite stacking height ( employed in experiments ) have the standing waves for those mixed modes along the stacked direction @xcite,@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the i - v characterisitics and the properties of em radiation in ijj s are clearly expected to exhibit a rich variety in contrast to sljj s . actually ,",
    "so far , the fluxon dynamics in ijj s have been investigated in several papers[2 - 7],@xcite to understand their dynamics and related em radiation , and complex resonant behaviors with some special modes have been reported .",
    "however , the full understanding for the behavior of the fluxons and josephson plasma oscillations has not been achieved .",
    "especially , the clear in - phase superradiant conditions in ijj s have not yet been established , and some questions still now remain concerning the stability of the superradiant flow state and its emergent region with respect to experimental variables as the magnetic field and the transport current . therefore , in this paper , we report results of the first direct large scale simulations for the fluxon dyanamics in ijj s using the coupled sine - gordon equation and clarify the superradiant conditions .",
    "furthermore , we pay attention to all dynamical flux flow states observed in various current ranges in the i - v characteristics and reveal that the i - v characteristics show three clear step - like structures corresponding to flux lattice structural transitions .",
    "thus , we distinguish flux flow states into four regions at these three step - like structures , and display the typical flux flow lattice configuration in each of the regions .",
    "the names region i @xmath4 iv ( in increasing order of the current ) will be assigned to the four regions . in order to identify the natures of the em radiations in the four regions ,",
    "the electric field oscillations at the sample edge , which characterize the properties of the emitted electromagnetic wave , are measured and their typical power spectrum in each region is given .    here",
    ", let us briefly describe the characters of the flux flow states observed in the four regions .",
    "the notable points are remarkable differences in the flux lattice configurations and power spectra for em field oscillations in those four regions . in region",
    "i , fluxons flow randomly without forming a clear lattice structure .",
    "this state is a steady state when the applied current is low enough , and the electric field oscillations at the edge exhibit a broad - band power spectrum . in region",
    "ii , wavy aligned flux flow states appear . from this region ,",
    "the vortex flow states begin to show resonances with some of the transverse propagating modes .",
    "the vortex alignments develop along the stacked direction , and the power spectrum has peak structures at a characteristic frequency and its higher harmonics . in region iii ,",
    "a perfect in - phase flux flow states emerges .",
    "the vortex alignment becomes perfect along the c - axis and fluxons form a rectangular lattice .",
    "the line - width of the power spectrum is very sharp and the power at the peak position is also very large , i.e. , the superradiant state . in region",
    "iv , triangular like lattice flux flow states are observed .",
    "its josephson frequencies due to the flux flow voltages are larger than the frequencies of any plasma modes .",
    "consequently , it is expected that the transverse plasma modes does not affect the formation of flux lattice structures and therefore energetic favorable triantular like lattice flow states appear . in order to understand the origin of the transitons between these four flux flow states , we perform an eigenmode analysis on the employed coupled sine - gordon equation . as a result , we are able to identify that the resonances between three modes and the flux flow states leads to three clear step - like structures in the i - v characteristics .",
    "thus , from this theoretical analysis , we can predict the width of the four regions , especially , the superradiant state ( region iii ) , in the i - v characteristics .",
    "also , the analysis clarifies that the superradiant state region enlarges with increasing a parameter ratio , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , superconducting and insulating layer thickness and @xmath8 is the penetration depth in the ab - plane direction .",
    "this result clearly indicates that ijj s can have remarkably wide superradinat region in i - v characterisitics .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the model equation employed is briefly introduced in section ii , and the numerical simulation results are shown in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to eigen mode analysis and discussions .",
    "we first explain our model . we perform the simulations under a configuration in which the transport current flows in the direction perpendicular to the junctions ( @xmath9 @xmath10-axis ) and the magnetic field is applied along the junctions ( @xmath9 @xmath11-axis ) as shown in fig.1 .",
    "= 9.4 cm = 7.0 cm    fig.1   a schetch of the intrinsic josephson junction .",
    "the magnetic field and the transport current are applied along the junction plane ( y - axis ) and the stacked directions ( z - axis ) , respectively .",
    "the josephson vortices move in the -x direction .",
    "the josephson vortices move parallel to the @xmath12-axis in this configuration . assuming that the superconducting layers have an atomic - scale thickness",
    ", we neglect the variation of physical quantities along the @xmath10-axis inside the superconducting layers .",
    "then , the vector potential is defined only inside the insulating layers as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for the layer index , and the electromangtic fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively given by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume maxwell s equations in the present system as follows , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the charge density at @xmath14-th superconducting layer and the dielectric constant of the insulating layers .",
    "the current , @xmath22 in eq.(1 ) is given by a sum of josephson and quasiparticle currents as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the critical current density and conductivity of the quasiparticles , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the gauge invariant phase difference defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the phase of the superconducting order parameter of @xmath14-th layer .",
    "the time and spatial derivatives for @xmath26 yield the generalized relations ,    @xmath29    where @xmath8 are the penetration depth associated with the current @xmath30 in the ab - plane and @xmath31 is the debye length @xcite @xcite . in deriving eq.(3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) , we employ the equation @xmath32 , which is analogous to the london equation and the london equation for the in - plane current , @xmath33 . in the case where @xmath34 under an external magnetic field the first term on the right hand side of eq.(3 ) gives only small contribution of @xmath35 to the dynamics of @xmath26 , which means that the incomplete screening effect for charges in the superconducting layers , namely the coupling between junctions due to the charge neutrality breaking effect @xcite,@xcite may be neglected in the presence of an external magnetic field . then , in this approximation the equation for @xmath26 is derived from eqs.(1)-(4 ) as follows @xcite , @xcite,@xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being , respectively , the josephson plasma frequency ( @xmath41 ) and the penetration depth in the @xmath42-axis direction . the parameter @xmath43 )",
    "is related the mccumber parameter @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "it is noted that eq.(5 ) gives a flat dispersion relation for the longitudinal mode along the @xmath42-axis while it leads to the dispersive one along the junctions .",
    "in this paper , we numerically solve eq.(5 ) for a finite size ijj composed of 20 junctions in which the @xmath46 cross section ( the @xmath47-plane in fig.1 ) has 2-dimensional ( 2d ) rectangular shape in the presence of an applied field ( @xmath48-axis ) and a transport current ( @xmath49-axis ) .",
    "the transport current and the magnetic field which includes the self - field are introduced through the boundary conditions at the top and bottom layers and the edges of all the layers . to perform the simulations we divide the system into 400 meshes along the @xmath50-direction .",
    "each mesh is assumed to be @xmath51 wide along the @xmath50-direction .",
    "then the system used in the simulations has the area of @xmath52 junctions if we assume @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the anisotropic parameter , which are typical parameter values in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the value of the material parameter @xmath55 is chosen as @xmath56 , which is also a typical value in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the results shown in this paper are qualitatively size - independent . we confirmed this by performing the simulations for system sizes up to @xmath57 junctions in real scale .",
    "let us now present the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the applied magnetic field used in the following calculations is fixed to a value , @xmath58 .",
    "the results for lower fields ( @xmath59 ) , which are qualitatively different , will be published elsewhere .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the @xmath60 characteristics of ijj .",
    "as seen in this figure , three clear steps appear at the voltage values indicated by arrows in the @xmath60 curve .",
    "to understand the origin of the steps , we plot the time and spatial averages of the poynting vector , @xmath61 , and the josephson current , @xmath62 in fig.2 ( b ) and ( c ) , where @xmath63 stands for the time average and @xmath64 is the area of the computational region .",
    "note that @xmath65 represents the energy flow of the transverse em field and @xmath66 gives a measure of the viscosity against the driven flux - flow .",
    "it is seen that the anomalous structures also appear in these averages , i.e. , the step - like structure in @xmath65 and the peaks in @xmath66 , at the same voltage values as in the @xmath60 characteristics .",
    "such anomalies are commonly observed in our simulations in the case where the magnetic field is greater than 1 t .",
    "thus , it is found that the vortex dynamics are directly coupled with the transverse em field and the vortex viscosity drastically changes at the step like structures . especially , it is noted that the viscosity of the josephson vortices takes maximum values at the steps . from this fact one may expect that the collective vortex dynamics changes at the steps . in the following ,",
    "we , therefore , separate the voltage region into four from i to iv at the steps as shown in fig.2(a ) and investigate the collective properties of each flux - flow state separately .",

    "note that the josephson plasma frequency at the zero temperature , @xmath71 , corresponds to @xmath72 in the figures for the power spectrum .",
    "let us study the flux - flow state in region i first . in fig.3(i )",
    "we show a snapshot of the distribution of the josephson current , @xmath73 , and the centers of the josephson vortices ( indicated by dots ) together with the power spectrum of the electric field at the left edge of the sample , @xmath74 .",
    "as seen in this figure , the vortices are distributed almost randomly and the power spectrum shows @xmath75 dependence above some frequency , which indicates the irregular motion of vortices .",
    "we confirmed this chaotic behavior of moving vortices by monitoring directly the time development of the vortex positions too . from these results",
    "one may conclude that the highly viscous flux - flow state is realized in region i. the fluxons are easily pinned by any type of imhomogeneities , e.g. , crystal imperfections , sample boundary etc . in this low driving - current regime . in the present system without imperfections the sample boundaries including the top and bottom junctions work as effective pinning centers , which is seen from the fact that the number of vortices in the top and bottom junctions is much smaller than that in other intermediate junctions .",
    "it is also noticed that the power spectrum forms a broad band in the low frequency region .",
    "thus , the chaotic viscous flux motion generates a broad - band oscillating em field in region i. the intensity of the emitted em field increases with increasing voltage values in this region .",
    "let us next turn to the region ii . as seen in the snapshot given in fig.3(ii ) , a wavy - chain - like vortex distribution is stabilized in this region .",
    "this result indicates that a correlation between vortices is developed in region ii . accordingly some characteristic frequency and its higher harmonics appear inside the broad band spectrum of the em field .",
    "these frequencies are related to the quasi - periodicity of the moving vortex lattice .",
    "it is also noted that the frequency of the highest peak seen in the figure is about eight times larger than the josephson plasma frequency at zero temperature , @xmath76 .",
    "this frequency corresponds to about 4thz in the case of @xmath53 and @xmath77 .    when the voltage is further increased and reaches the value at the boundary between the regions ii and iii , the moving vortices form a rectangular lattice as shown in fig.3(iii ) .",
    "this regular distribution of the vortices is stable and maintained throughout the region iii .",
    "it is seen that sharp peaks appear in the power spectrum of the em field .",
    "the frequencies giving the peaks are determined by the flux flow velocity and the period of the lattice .",
    "note that the phase differences of all the junctions make perfect in - phase motion in this state , that is , _",
    "the superradiant state is realized in the region iii_. in this superradiant state one may expect the strong radiation of the coherent em field from the junctions .",
    "the frequencies of the emitted em field will be tunable in a wide range by the applied magnetic field or the voltage since the region iii is broad as seen in the @xmath60 curves .",

    "the rectangular lattice of the moving vortices becomes unstable at the boundary between the regions iii and iv .",
    "the moving vortex lattice appearing in the region iv is a modulated triangular one as depicted in fig.3(iv ) . the power spectrum given in fig.3(iv ) indicates that the intensity of the em field generated in this state is greatly reduced from that in the region iii .",
    "this result is easily understood in the following way .",
    "the oscillatory components of the tunneling current on two consecutive junctions can not be in - phase in a triangular - like lattice . as a result ,",
    "the em field generated at the junction edges on consecutive junctions interfere destructively with each other and , therefore , the intensity of the power spectrum drastically decreases in this region .",
    "to understand the origin of the transitions in the moving vortex state we perform a linear analysis in the following .",

    "we plot the spatial variation of @xmath87 for four values ( n=0,1,2,and 19 ) of @xmath85 in the case of @xmath88 , which represents the standing waves along the @xmath42-axis . in the presence of an external magnetic field , @xmath89 , and a dc voltage , @xmath90 , eq.(5 )",

    "this equation has solutions showing resonances at @xmath98\\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this resonant behavior originates as a result that the josephson oscillations induced by the moving flux - line lattice match the transverse josephson plasma frequencies .",
    "note that the resonant frequencies coincide with the eigen - frequencies @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the matching voltages ( @xmath101 ) as a function of @xmath89 in the case of @xmath88 . in fig.4(b ) , we superpose the vertical lines indicating the matching voltages at @xmath102 on the @xmath60 curve .",
    "as seen in this figure , the voltages matching with the modes a ( @xmath103 ) and b ( @xmath104 ) coincide with the 3rd and 2nd steps and the lowest matching voltage is also located close to the 1st step in the @xmath60 curves .",
    "these analyses indicate that the structural transitions in the moving flux - line lattice are caused by the matching of the phase oscillations arising from the vortex motion with that of the eigen - modes of the system .",

    "( b ) the i - v characterisitcs same as fig.1(a ) .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the matching voltage of all eigenmodes , and a , b , c , and d correspond to those shown in fig.4(a ) , respectively    here , it is noted that not all the matching voltages cause clear step - like anomalies in the @xmath60 characteristics .",
    "however , we have directly observed the structural change , for example , near the voltage value at c by monitoring the vortex configuration .",
    "since the @xmath60 characteristics is given by a sum of the contribution from all the junctions , it is understood that it is not so sensitive for a slight structural change in the moving flux - line lattice , that is , in a case that the current distribution is not largely altered at the transition , a clear anomalous structure will not appear in the @xmath60 characteristics .",
    "we also notice that the matching with the modes , a and b , obtained in the above linear analyses gives the precise phase boundaries of the region iii .",
    "this fact indicates that the above analysis is sufficiently valid in this region , that is , the oscillatory part @xmath111 is only a small perturbation and the phase - locked in - phase flux - flow state , which is the moving rectangular - lattice state , is very stable .",
    "the width of the region iii is given by @xmath112h$ ] .",
    "since @xmath113 is very small in high-@xmath114superconductors , the superradiant state is expected to be very wide in ijj s .",

    "they claim that the em waves emitted from the junctions are generated by the chrenkov radiation due to the moving vortices @xcite,@xcite . from our simuration results",
    ", we may suggest two possibilities for the origin of the broad - band emission .",
    "the first one is the cherenkov - type radiation as claimed by hechtfisher et al .",
    "rough estimation for the present model indicates that the threshhold voltage for the cherenkov radiation lies in region ii , in which we really observe the broad - band spectrum in the low - frequency region as seen in fig.3(ii ) .",
    "it is noted that this result is consistent with simulation resutls by hechtfischer et al @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the step - like anomaly observed in the @xmath60 curve of bi-2212 may be identified with the boundary between the regions ii and iii in our simurations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible to interprete that the step coresponds to the boundary between the regions i and ii , which leads to another possibility for the origin of the observed broad - band emmission . in this second scenario",
    ", it is understood that the observed em field originates from the vortex state in region i. since no transverse propagating josephson plasma mode can be coupled with such the slow vortex motions in this region , one may interprete that the broad - band spectrum reflects chaotic em field oscillations due to the non - regular motion of vortices . here ,",
    "note that step structure in ivc at the boundary between the region i and ii in simulations is the most remarkable structure and it is similar with experimental results @xcite . to clarify the mechanism of the broad - band emission , we will need more detailed theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "in conclusion , we performe direct large scale numerical simulations on josephson vortex flow states in ijj s and find structural transitions of the moving flux - line lattice accompanied by the step - like structures in the i - v characteristics and changes of power spectrums of ac electric field at the sample edge .",
    "the four typical flux flow states and the corresponding power spectra are identified and the in - phase superradiant flux flow state are found to exist stably in a wide region in the i - v characteristics .",
    "the comparison between the simulation results and the eigenmode analysis for the transverse propagating josephson plasma modes show that those step - like structures in the i - v characteristics are due to resonances between flux flow motions and transverse propagating josephson plasma modes .",
    "furthermore , the analysis predict that the superradiant state region enlarges as the superconducting and insulating layer thickness is decreased compared to the magnetic pentration depth in the ab - plane direction .",
    "the collective josephson vortex flow under the presence of many propagating modes includes very rich varieties of physics , while the stable superradiant flux flow state will be a key feature in making successfully submilimeter - wave generator employing ijj s .",
