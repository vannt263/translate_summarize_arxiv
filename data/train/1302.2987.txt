    "we can expect the interplay between lattice qcd predictions and experimental measurement to be very productive in the coming years .",
    "in the case of nucleon resonances , the first positive parity excitation of the nucleon , the @xmath4 or roper resonance , has been a subject of considerable interest since its discovery in 1964 through a partial - wave analysis of pion - nucleon scattering data   @xcite .",

    "( with principal quantum number @xmath6 ) appears above the lowest - lying odd - parity @xmath7 ( 1535 ) state  @xcite , whereas in nature the roper resonance is almost 100 mev below the @xmath7 state .",
    "this presents a phenomenological challenge to our understanding of level ordering .",
    "similar difficulties occur with the @xmath8 and @xmath9 resonances .",
    "due to its surprisingly low mass , the @xmath5 state has lead to enormous curiosity and much speculation about its nature .",
    "for example , the roper resonance has been described as a hybrid baryon with explicitly excited gluon field configurations  @xcite , or as a breathing mode of the ground state  @xcite or as a five quark ( meson - baryon ) state  @xcite .",
    "significant resources have been devoted in the past from the lattice qcd perspective to find the elusive low - lying roper state , in both quenched  @xcite and in full  @xcite qcd .",
    "the ` variational method '  @xcite is the state - of - the - art approach for determining the excited state hadron spectrum .",
    "it is based on the creation of a matrix of correlation functions in which different superpositions of excited - state contributions are linearly combined to isolate the energy eigenstates .",
    "a low - lying roper state was identified with this method using a variety of source and sink smearings in constructing correlation matrices  @xcite in quenched qcd .",

    "the number of energy states revealed in the correlation matrix method depends on the number of unique operators chosen which have the quantum numbers of the desired states .",
    "hence , a clear identification of these states is necessary to observe changes in these energy - states as a function of quark mass , in principle to the physical quark mass .",
    "this allows the quark mass dependence and structure of the extracted energy eigenstates to be explored systematically .",
    "the new technique that we develop here can be used when any parameter of the theory is varied to explore how the nature of the states and energies change with that parameter .    the principal focus of this paper is to present the details of our eigenvector analysis to track the states from the heavy to the light quark mass region . in doing so",

    "we havent been able to isolate the multi - particle thresholds at our three light quark masses .",
    "we proceed under the assumption that the couplings to these 5 + quark states have relatively small overlap with our 3-quark interpolators and that the effective mass functions are largely unaffected by multi - particle states with small couplings to our interpolators . to monitor this we use the full covariance - matrix based @xmath10 in order to accurately assess the extent to which our effective mass function plateau is associated with a single state .",
    "ultimately , in addition to the 3-quark operators , one needs to include 5- or 7- or more- quark operators  @xcite in the correlation matrix to extract all the states in the spectrum .",
    "if we denote the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the lattice hamiltonian to be @xmath11 , then in an ideal world we would select @xmath11 linearly independent operators to construct our @xmath12 correlation matrix with sufficient statistical accuracy and then diagonalize this to obtain the exact @xmath11 energy eigenstates for this lattice hamiltonian . obviously and unfortunately this is not computationally feasible on any realistic lattice and the best that we can do is choose a relatively small number of operators , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",

    "then as before , we can define @xmath224 as an @xmath160 correlation matrix , then @xmath225 can be written as the upper left @xmath160 block of @xmath161 such that @xmath226,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the off - diagonal rectangular matrix @xmath227 has elements @xmath228 for @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "clearly @xmath227 mixes the upper and lower diagonal blocks .    in terms of the full @xmath12 correlation matrix @xmath161",
    "we define @xmath212 as before and it has the form @xmath231 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is of course diagonalized by the full @xmath12 unitary matrix @xmath206 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqrtgt0_gt0plusdeltat_sqrtgt0 ] ) .",
    "let us now temporarily assume that the off - diagonal elements of @xmath212 are zero , then @xmath232 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then it follows that the time independent unitary matrix can be written as @xmath233 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this will occur if and only if we have chosen our @xmath13 interpolating fields such that they span exactly the same subspace as @xmath13 of the exact energy eigenstates .",
    "but we will certainly never exactly achieve this and so mixing will occur through @xmath234 . in this case",
    "@xmath206 will not have this convenient block diagonal form .",
    "let @xmath235 diagonalize @xmath236 , i.e. @xmath235 is an @xmath160 unitary matrix defined at this particular @xmath237 . then if @xmath234 we see that @xmath238 and in general @xmath235 will not be independent of @xmath237 .",
    "note that @xmath13 linearly independent interpolating field operators will operate on the vacuum and give rise to @xmath13 linearly independent states .",
    "the more closely these @xmath13 linearly independent states come to spanning the same subspace as @xmath13 exact energy eigenstates , then the smaller will be @xmath227 and the more block diagonal will be @xmath239 and @xmath206 . we can only ensure that @xmath236 commutes with itself at all @xmath237 if @xmath206 is block diagonal , i.e. , if @xmath240 so that @xmath241 and is therefore time independent",
    ". then the smaller will be the off - diagonal elements and the smaller will be the mixing and the excited state contamination .    in practice @xmath14 , since on a lattice the dimensionality of hilbert space is in the many millions .",
    "we would like to choose the @xmath13 interpolating fields such that they span an @xmath13-dimensional subspace that has the greatest overlap possible with the subspace spanned by the @xmath13 lowest energy eigenstates @xmath242 . with the lowest energy eigenstates our numerical errors",
    "will be minimized , since by working at large euclidean times we minimize the influence of the higher excited state contamination and so optimize our extraction of the lowest @xmath13 energy eigenstates .",
    "since the interpolating fields produced states @xmath243 that were not normalized in any way , it is numerically convenient to redefine @xmath244 where there is no sum over @xmath245 . therefore , we attempt to put the strengths of our interpolating fields at a comparable level by defining @xmath246 to ensure that the matrix elements of @xmath247 are all @xmath103 to maximize numerical significance of all `` @xmath248 '' combinations .",
    "this is completely legitimate as it is simply a change to the normalization chosen for our interpolating fields , which we are free to do .",
    "the matrix @xmath247 is hermitian except for the effects of finite ensemble and round - off errors .",
    "let us define @xmath249 as an improved unbiased estimator of the ensemble average for @xmath250 . then @xmath251 is exactly hermitian .",
    "therefore , as before , we may diagonalize @xmath252 ,    \\label{eq : final_hermitian_mat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is also hermitian , as @xmath253 and @xmath254 are obviously hermitian .",
    "the eigenvectors ( @xmath129 ) obtained from diagonalizing the above matrix are therefore orthonormal .",
    "it is noted that using the @xmath255 trick  @xcite , where these @xmath206 s are links here , the hermitian correlation matrix @xmath225 is real symmetric and so the eigenvalues remain real and the eigenvectors orthogonal .",
    "again , it is important to note that the more poorly we choose our @xmath13 interpolating fields then the bigger will be the off - diagonal elements of @xmath256 .",
    "hence the more time - dependent will be the @xmath235 and the less reliable our extracted energies and eigenvectors .",
    "now we can consider @xmath257 as a function of quark mass , @xmath258 , to identify how a given state evolves with @xmath258 .",
    "if @xmath259 with @xmath260 small , we expect @xmath261 if @xmath262 and @xmath263 if @xmath264 .",
