    "the demographics of intermediate - mass black holes are of particular importance for future gravitational - wave studies , since it is expected that the most common massive black hole merger events detected by the space - based _",

    "intermediate - mass black holes that would be undetectable by dynamical measurements might still reveal their presence by their accretion luminosity .",

    "the better - known case is the nearby ( @xmath16 mpc ) , late - type , dwarf spiral galaxy ngc 4395 .",
    "@xcite found that ngc 4395 contains the least luminous known seyfert 1 nucleus . despite the fact that this galaxy has no discernible bulge , and thus might not be expected to contain a central black hole",

    "the central stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath17 km s@xmath6 , which combined with the radius of the central star cluster ( 3.9 pc ) gives a firm upper limit of @xmath18 @xmath10  for the combined mass of the central star cluster plus black hole @xcite .",

    "ksb noted the presence of a weak broad component to the h@xmath2and h@xmath34  lines but still classified pox 52 as a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "the broad components are clearly present in the keck data ; thus , pox 52 should be classified as a seyfert 1 galaxy . in the @xcite classification scheme , pox 52",

    "in contrast , the [ ] and [ ] lines appear devoid of broad components .",
    "to decompose the h@xmath2  profile into narrow and broad components , we performed a fit to the continuum - subtracted h@xmath2  line using a model consisting of a broad gaussian plus a narrow component with the same profile as the [ ] @xmath46 line .",

    "the need for a distinct broad component in the model fit is clearly apparent , and the broad component contains 34% of the total h@xmath2  flux .",

    ". however , the _ total _ ( broad + narrow ) h@xmath34/h@xmath2  intensity ratio ( which is insensitive to the broad / narrow decomposition ) , corrected for galactic extinction , is @xmath50h@xmath34@xmath51h@xmath2@xmath52 , indicating that there is little internal extinction within pox 52 .",
    "the width of the broad - line component is also rather uncertain because the model is a poor fit to the extended wings of h@xmath34 , but the best - fitting model has fwhm = @xmath53 km s@xmath6 , consistent with the broad h@xmath2  linewidth .",
    "overall , the narrow - line intensities relative to h@xmath2  are very similar to those reported by @xcite for ngc 4395 . one difference , which is apparent in figure [ specplot ] , is the ratio of the [ ] @xmath54 emission lines , indicating a lower - density narrow - line region ( nlr ) in pox 52 .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 is 1.12 in pox 52 and 0.88 in ngc 4395 , corresponding to electron densities of @xmath56 and 1000 @xmath57 , respectively , for @xmath58 k. the lower [ ] / [ ] ratio is also indicative of a lower - density nlr in pox 52 .",
    "the larger [ ] /h@xmath34  ratio in pox 52 suggests that it may have a higher nitrogen abundance than ngc 4395 ; @xcite have shown that the ngc 4395 nucleus has a low n / o ratio of about 1/3 solar .",
    "ksb found that the widths of the narrow lines in pox 52 were marginally resolved in comparison with their arc lamp spectrum , and inferred an intrinsic linewidth of fwhm = 320 km s@xmath6  for the narrow emission lines in pox 52 .",
    "the esi data show that the forbidden lines are much narrower than this estimate .",
    "the [ ] @xmath46 linewidth was measured in three different ways : by a direct measurement of the full width at half of the peak flux ( fwhm = 93 km s@xmath6 ) , by a gaussian fit ( fwhm = 102 km s@xmath6 ) , and by a lorentzian fit ( fwhm = 83 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "neither model fit proved to fit the asymmetric line profile particularly well , and we adopt fwhm = @xmath59 km s@xmath6  as the best estimate of the observed linewidth .",
    "subtracting the instrumental fwhm of 0.56   ( measured from arc lamp exposures ) in quadrature , the intrinsic linewidth is then fwhm ( [ ] ) = @xmath60 km s@xmath6 .      as a seyfert 1 galaxy ,",
    "pox 52 should contain a central x - ray source .",
    "we searched the available x - ray archives for images containing the position of pox 52 , and found only one matching dataset , from the _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "this survey scanned the sky with the _ rosat _  pspc detector ( 0.4 - 2.4 kev energy band ) , covering each point on average with a @xmath61 s integration .",
    "the typical 1@xmath62 positional uncertainty is 12 , which includes a systematic uncertainty of 6 , largely due to boresight corrections .",
    "the fwhm of the pspc point - spread function ( psf ) is 20 .",
    "the exposure time for the field surrounding pox 52 was only @xmath63 s , where the uncertainty is the range of exposure in adjacent 15  cells .",
    "there is no obvious , strong x - ray source at the position of pox 52 , but careful examination of the image does reveal a localized excess above the background count rate .",
    "the 75% energy radius ( that is , the radius which would enclose 75% of the pspc psf ) is 20@xcite . combining the 20  radius for the psf with the 6systematic uncertainty ( summed in quadrature ) , we took a region of radius 21  about the known position of pox 52 in the _",
    "rosat_data , and found two counts within it ( see figure [ rosat ] ) . in the surrounding 1800  radius region , there were 370 counts , giving a mean background level of @xmath64 counts per square arcsecond .",

    "if we permit the error circle to expand to @xmath67 ( at which point there is a third count ) the probability of chance coincidence of two counts at this location can be as high as 0.9% .",
    "examination of the properties of the two counts showed them to be of low energy , occurring in pulse - height invariant ( pi ) channels 57 and 58 , at approximately @xmath68 kev . taking only pi channels 20 - 80 for background",
    ", this decreases the background rate to @xmath69 counts per square arcsecond .",
    "subsequently , the significance for two counts within 21  becomes 0.04% , and within 30  is 0.2% .",
    "we adopt the significance of detection to be in the range of 0.04%-0.2% ( 3.0 - 3.5@xmath62 ) .",
    "the observed energy fluence from this source is approximately 1 kev . using poisson statistics to determine the counting uncertainty @xcite",
    ", the detection contains 2@xmath70 counts ( @xmath71 poisson error bars ) .",
    "the detector area at 0.5 kev is @xmath72 @xmath73 , and total flux from the source is @xmath74 erg @xmath75  s@xmath6 . for @xmath76 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to a time - averaged luminosity of @xmath77 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "note that the detection certainty is higher than indicated by the flux uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , given the shallowness of the _ rosat _  exposure and the bare 3.0 - 3.5@xmath62 significance of the source detection , the best that can be done is to extract a very rough estimate of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "it would be extremely worthwhile to observe pox 52 with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ to confirm this detection , and to properly quantify its x - ray luminosity , spectral shape , and variability , particularly in light of the extreme short - timescale variability recently found in ngc 4395 @xcite .",
    "a _ rosat _  observation of ngc 4395 by @xcite revealed a soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath78 erg s@xmath6  ( after rescaling to @xmath79 mpc ) .",
    "taking our _ rosat _  measurement at face value , pox 52 is then @xmath80 times more luminous than ngc 4395 in soft x - rays , although this is at best a rough comparison because of the large uncertainty in the _ rosat _  measurement as well as the possibility of strong x - ray variability in pox 52 .",
    "we searched for pox 52 in the nrao vla sky survey archives @xcite and did not find a source at the galaxy s position .",
    "this implies a @xmath81 upper limit of @xmath82 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the field of pox 52 was not observed in the vla first survey .",
    "numerous stellar absorption features are visible in the esi spectrum , making it possible to measure the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath83 .",
    "we determined @xmath83  from the near - infrared triplet lines , which are generally the best features for measurement of stellar kinematics @xcite , and also from the region surrounding mg  @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite have recently published high - resolution spectra of the ca triplet spectral region for ngc 4395 and determined an upper limit to its stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath17 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 4395 presented particular problems for this measurement , because the @xmath84 and @xmath85 absorption features were almost completely filled in by the paschen - series p16 and p15 emission lines .",
    "this left @xmath86 as the only uncontaminated stellar feature that could be used to measure @xmath83 .",
    "the p16 emission line is located 6 redward of @xmath86 , but in ngc 4395 the emission and absorption lines are sufficiently narrow that the two features do not overlap .",
    "the presence of higher - order paschen emission lines is an unusual characteristic of ngc 4395 and pox 52 , which have extremely narrow emission lines of relatively high equivalent width . in most seyfert galaxies the high - order p13p17 lines are not visible at all ; it is much more common to see the lines themselves in emission , particularly in nls1 galaxies having strong emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in pox 52 ,",
    "some high - order paschen - series emission lines are visible ( table [ emissionlines ] ) but their equivalent widths are smaller than those in ngc 4395 , as shown in figure [ dispersion ] .",
    "the @xmath85 line is partly filled in by p13 emission , but the 8498 and 8542   absorption lines appear to be largely uncontaminated , and we use those lines to determine @xmath83 .    the measurement was performed by a direct fit of gaussian - broadened stellar spectra to the pox 52 spectrum over the range 84708570  , following the techniques described by @xcite .",
    "the model - fitting code broadens the stellar template by convolution with a gaussian in velocity space , and allows an additive featureless continuum contribution and a multiplicative correction described by a low - order polynomial ( a quadratic in this case ) to account for reddening or other differences in overall spectral shape between the galaxy and the template star .",
    "the fit of the broadened template star to the galaxy spectrum is performed directly in pixel space so that individual spectral features such as emission lines can be masked out from the computation of @xmath87 .",
    "the result for pox 52 is @xmath88 km s@xmath6 , where the uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of the fitting error for the best - fitting template star ( hd 211645 , g9 iii ) and the standard deviation of the velocity dispersions measured from all 7 template stars .",
    "the model fits include a featureless continuum that contributes @xmath89 of the total flux in the extracted spectrum at 8500   to match the dilution of the stellar features .",
    "one concern is that weak paschen emission could be partly filling in the red wings of the 8498 and 8542 absorption lines , which would make the above result an underestimate of the true velocity dispersion . to test this possibility , we performed the measurement again , fitting only to the core and blue wing of each absorption line , and the surrounding continuum , but excluding the red wing of both ca lines from the fit ( i.e. , the regions that would be most strongly affected by paschen emission ) .",
    "the best - fitting template star then gave @xmath90 km s@xmath6 , in agreement with the @xmath71 uncertainty range of our original measurement .",
    "thus , the result @xmath91 km s@xmath6  appears to be robust even if there is slight contamination by the p15 and p16 emission lines .    as an additional check on this result",
    ", we also performed model fits to the spectral region surrounding the mg  @xmath40  absorption lines . as shown in figure [ mgb ] , the mg  @xmath40  lines are contaminated by emission from [ ] @xmath92 and from [ ] @xmath93 , as well as a broad `` bump '' in the spectrum over @xmath94   which may be a blend of weaker emission lines .",
    "therefore , we fit broadened stellar templates to the regions immediately surrounding mg  @xmath40 , from 5020 to 5320  but excluding the region 51405210   from the @xmath87  minimization .",
    "the result , @xmath95 km s@xmath6 , is consistent with the dispersion measured from the lines , and the broadened template gives a reasonable fit to the galaxy spectrum except at wavelengths affected by the emission lines .",
    "ksb found that the luminosity profile of pox 52 was best represented by an exponential disk model with a central point source , and we expected that our optical imaging data would show spiral structure or evidence for recent star formation in a host galaxy similar to ngc 4395 .",
    "however , the new images reveal a very different morphology for pox 52 .",
    "there is no obvious spiral or disklike structure in the images , and none of the images shows any obvious clumpiness such as might be expected from star - forming regions in the host galaxy . as shown in figure [ galfitfig ] , the optical structure of pox 52 is most suggestive of a small elliptical galaxy with a bright nuclear point source .    to study the structure of the host galaxy quantitatively , we fit models to the galaxy s luminosity profile using the 2-dimensional fitting code galfit @xcite .",

    "the calibration of the size - luminosity relationship is subject to some uncertainty , as discussed in detail by @xcite , as its slope for seyfert galaxies is somewhat different from that for quasars , and also dependent on whether or not the discrepant galaxy ngc 4051 is included in the fitting .",

    ". however , pox 52 and ngc 4395 are extreme cases in the sense of having very weak broad components with strong narrow components that dominate the total h@xmath2  flux . for these objects , the fwhm of the _ total _",

    "used to determine the linewidth - luminosity correlation , h@xmath2  is dominated by the broad component , sometimes containing a weak bump of narrow - line emission . for an appropriate comparison between pox 52 and the calibration sample ,",
    "the best option is to use only the broad - line component to determine @xmath123  and hence @xmath119 , following the approach used by @xcite for ngc 4395 .    from the galfit decomposition ,",

    "this mass estimate is admittedly quite uncertain .",
    "the linewidth - mass - luminosity relations have only been calibrated for masses greater than @xmath11 @xmath10  @xcite , so an order - of - magnitude extrapolation is required if this method is to be applied to pox 52 .",
    "in addition , there appears to be significant intrinsic scatter in these relations , and the h@xmath2  method may yield masses that are uncertain by a factor of @xmath132 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a further caveat is that the imaging and spectroscopic observations were not simultaneous , and the active nucleus in pox 52 could be variable on short timescales .",
    "nevertheless , even bearing these uncertainties in mind , the resulting mass estimate indicates that the black hole in pox 52 most likely has a mass well below @xmath11 @xmath10 .    with this estimate , it is possible to examine whether pox 52 follows the correlations between black hole mass and host galaxy properties . for the @xmath133  relation ,",

    "the correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity ( @xmath140 ) can also be compared with this @xmath119  estimate , since the photometric decomposition suggests that the host galaxy light is predominantly from a bulge or spheroidal component with little or no disk contribution . using the fit to the @xmath119-@xmath140correlations from @xcite and from @xcite , which use @xmath125-band bulge luminosities ,",
    "the implied value of @xmath119  is in the range @xmath141 @xmath10 .",

    "the @xmath133correlation is generally thought to have smaller scatter than the @xmath119-@xmath140  correlation @xcite , although @xcite claim that @xmath119  correlates most tightly with bulge mass rather than with @xmath83  or luminosity alone .",

    "following @xcite , we assume a distance of 4.2 mpc to ngc 4395 .",
    "using either the @xmath125-band continuum flux of the ngc 4395 nucleus @xcite or its narrow h@xmath2  flux @xcite , we find that the agn in pox 52 is approximately 200 times more luminous than the one in ngc 4395 .",

    ". then , for @xmath151 @xmath10 , the eddington ratio is in the range @xmath152 .",

    "in contrast , @xcite estimated @xmath153 for ngc 4395 .",
    "given the apparently large difference in the accretion rates of these two objects , the overall similarity in their optical spectra is somewhat surprising .    assuming that @xmath154 in pox 52 , a lower limit to @xmath119  can be derived .",
    "the smaller estimate of @xmath147  ( @xmath155 erg s@xmath6 ) implies @xmath156 @xmath10 .      what type of galaxy is pox 52 ?",

    "dwarf ellipticals , giant ellipticals , dwarf spheroidals , and globular clusters are well - segregated in @xmath160-space , as shown by @xcite and @xcite . combining our @xmath125-band host galaxy parameters with the stellar velocity dispersion , we find @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 for pox 52 .",
    "figure [ kappa ] illustrates the position of pox 52 in the @xmath160-space projections , in comparison with data from the literature .",
    "pox 52 lies closest to the family of dwarf ellipticals , although it is slightly offset from the virgo dwarf ellipticals studied by @xcite in the sense of having somewhat higher surface brightness and lower mass - to - light ratio .",
    "one possible explanation could be a younger stellar population in pox 52 than in the virgo dwarf ellipticals , but this may be unlikely given the normal @xmath157 color of pox 52 . a more likely explanation may be systematic uncertainty in the galfit decomposition ; the unusual srsic index for pox 52 could be the result of an imperfect model fit to the host galaxy resulting from the presence of the extremely bright central point source . imaging data from the _ hubble space telescope _ would provide a much more accurate decomposition into point - source and host galaxy components and a better measurement of the srsic index and the galaxy profile within the inner arcsecond . with the present data ,",
    "we conclude that pox 52 is best classified as a dwarf elliptical , although perhaps a peculiar one .    to our knowledge",
    ", no other dwarf elliptical galaxy has been found to host a seyfert nucleus .",
    "one object that has been referred to as a dwarf elliptical with an agn is the nearby galaxy ngc 3226 @xcite .",
    "its nucleus is a liner with a broad component to the h@xmath34  emission line @xcite , and it is also an x - ray source @xcite . while there is no question that ngc 3226 hosts a genuine agn , it is too massive and too large to be classified as a true dwarf elliptical galaxy .",
    "it has an absolute magnitude of @xmath167 and @xmath168 km s@xmath6  @xcite , which suggests a likely black hole mass of order @xmath169 @xmath10  from the @xmath133relation .",
    "thus , ngc 3226 appears to be a small but ordinary elliptical , probably with a fairly massive black hole that is accreting at an extremely sub - eddington rate , and it is very different from the `` dwarf agns '' in pox 52 and ngc 4395 with @xmath170 @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the stellar and gaseous linewidths in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the near equality between fwhm ( [ ] ) and @xmath171 in most seyferts suggests that the widths of the narrow lines are largely determined by virial motion in the bulge of the host galaxy , although objects with radio jets tend to have systematically broader emission lines for a given @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , pox 52 follows this trend almost perfectly , with @xmath172 km s@xmath6 , nearly equal to the [ ] fwhm of @xmath173 km s@xmath6 .",

    "pox 52 is not listed by ramella et al .  as a group member , but its recession velocity fits within this velocity range , and its projected distance from the group center is 1.3 mpc , so it is may be associated with the group although it is well outside the group s central region . the local environment does not , however , yield any clues as to why this particular dwarf galaxy should be undergoing an agn accretion episode .",
    "new spectra confirm that pox 52 is a genuine seyfert galaxy , and the broad components seen on the permitted line profiles ( first detected by ksb ) demonstrate that pox 52 should be classified as a seyfert 1 .",
    "the host galaxy morphology is most similar to that of a dwarf elliptical .",
    "this is only the second known example of a seyfert nucleus in a dwarf galaxy , and the first in a dwarf elliptical .",
    "the black hole mass , estimated from the h@xmath2  linewidth - luminosity - mass correlations for seyferts , is @xmath182 @xmath10 , and for this value of @xmath119  pox 52 falls very close to the extrapolated @xmath133relation of nearby galaxies .",
    "if this black hole mass estimate is accurate , then the agn in pox 52 is likely to be radiating at nearly its maximal rate , with @xmath183 .",
    "with only two known agns in dwarf galaxies , little can be said about the statistics or demographics of this class of objects .",
    "the small sample can be at least partly attributed to the fact that no systematic searches for agns in dwarf galaxies have been carried out .",
