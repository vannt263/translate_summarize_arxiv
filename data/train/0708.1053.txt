    "cataclysmic variables ( hereafter cvs ) are short period semidetached interacting binary systems containing a white dwarf as a primary which accretes matter from a roche - lobe - filled red dwarf companion @xcite typically via an accretion disc . a bright spot is formed in the location where the matter stream impacts on the accretion disc . in the cvs with strong magnetic primaries ,",
    "the magnetic field is strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disc .",
    "disc formation could be prevented , but accretion continues through channels as accretion flows . for a detailed description of the cv phenomenon and",
    "its subclasses see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many basic properties of cvs , such as the masses of the component stars , can not be directly determined @xcite .",
    "the orbital period @xmath6 is one of the exceptions as it is known directly from observations with a fair accuracy .",
    "orbital periods with sufficient accuracy are available now for more than 640 systems @xcite . since an orbital period distribution is a useful indicator of dynamical evolution of orbits , most studies which are interested in the evolution of cvs are mainly concentrated on the distribution of orbital periods .",
    "the most striking features of the distribution of cv periods are the period gap and a sharp cut - off at about 80 min @xcite",
    ".    galactic space and velocity distributions could be crucial for various types of objects to indicate a general scenario or a stage on a scenario about their evolution .",
    "any proposed evolutionary scheme must not be in conflict with data from stellar statistics @xcite .",
    "if the space densities of systems in various intervals of orbital periods were known this would seriously improve our understanding of cv evolution",
    ". however , observational selection effects are usually strong .",
    "therefore , even a rough estimate of space density may help to constrain the population models @xcite .",
    "standard models for the population of cvs predict a galactic space density of @xmath7 pc@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these predictions are inconsistent with the observed space densities of @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 pc@xmath8 @xcite .    from the observational point of view , the first step of deriving the space density of cvs is to collect the most truthfull cv distances in a selected sample . only after reliable distances",
    "are available , the observed surface angular density distribution of cvs on the sky could be converted to a galactic spatial distribution .",
    "previous space density estimates of cvs have been made from the samples which include cvs with distances according to various methods .",
    "the problems of those early estimations are mostly due to inadequate number of cvs with reliable distances .",
    "unfortunately , there is no single technique , no `` magic bullet '' , for distance finding to cvs @xcite .",
    "however , a single method , which is able to provide reliable distances of all cvs , would be crucial in computing the true space distribution and the space density of these objects .",
    "such a method was recently suggested by @xcite .",
    "the suggested method uses period - luminosity - colours ( pcls ) relation of cvs calibrated by _ 2mass _ photometric data and trigonometric parallaxes for a sufficient number of cvs .    nevertheless , the interstellar reddening is one of the important dilemmas in a distance determination .",
    "the reddening corrections have been made so far by using short - wavelength observations , column densities , reddening maps , in general .",
    "however , the reddening coefficients in optical wavelengths are higher than in infrared wavelengths .",
    "the distance estimation technique proposed by @xcite is less affected by interstellar reddening since it is based on infrared colours from _ 2mass _ observations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive the spatial distribution , galactic model parameters and luminosity function of cvs in the solar neighbourhood using the distances estimated by the new method proposed by @xcite , which could be applicable to all cvs with reliable periods and colours .",
    "consequently , a data sample containing 459 cvs has been collected and analysed .",
    "description of data , reddening problem , distances corrected for reddening , completeness of sample and galactic model parameters are discussed in section 2 .",
    "after the analysis regarding to space distributions and luminosity functions in section 3 , conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "table 1 contains _ 2mass _ photometric data , colour excesses and orbital periods of cvs which were collected for this study .",
    "in addition to the columns of name , type , orbital period , galactic coordinates ( @xmath13 ) , colour excess @xmath14 , apperent brightness ( @xmath3 ) and infrared colours @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are the basic observatinal data , the last two colums ( absolute magnitude , distance ) are added as predictions from the plcs relation of @xcite .",
    "a preliminary list of cataclysmic variables with orbital periods is collected from downes et al.s ( @xcite ) and ritter and kolb s ( @xcite ) catalogues .",
    "superhump periods of su uma type dwarf novae , for which the orbital periods are not known , are accepted as orbital periods .",
    "the bias introduced by using the superhump periods should be negligible since the superhump periods are only a few per cent longer than the orbital periods @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 magnitudes of the sample stars were taken from the point - source catalogue and atlas @xcite which is based on the _ 2mass _ ( two micron all sky survey ) observations .",
    "the _ 2mass _ photometric system comprises johnson s @xmath3 ( 1.25 @xmath19 m ) and @xmath17 ( 1.65 @xmath19 m ) bands with the addition of @xmath18 ( 2.17 @xmath19 m ) band , which is bluer than johnson s @xmath20-band .",
    "the limiting apparent magnitudes are 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 , for the three bands respectively @xcite .",
    "the number of cvs having an orbital period and _ 2mass _ photometric data is 541 .",
    "however , 82 of them were removed because they are beyond the limits of applicability of the plcs relation , which will be discussed later .",
    "consequently , the number of cvs selected for this study was reduced to 459 and all are recorded in table 1 .",
    "intrinsic @xmath21 and @xmath22 colours and an orbital period are the basic parameters needed for the plcs relation of @xcite to provide an absolute magnitude of a cv , from which its distance can be computed .",
    "however , unlike the observed colours , which are directly available from the photometric observations , derivation of the intrinsic colours requires one more step namely using various colour excess values , if spectroscopic observations are not available to reveal them independently . for estimating the @xmath21 and @xmath22 colours , for this study the colour excess of @xmath14 has been used .",
    "although the @xmath14 values for some cvs are given in @xcite , we have preferred to use their first order predictions from the schlegel , finkbeiner @xmath23 davis ( @xcite ) maps by using nasa extragalactic database in order to obtain a self - consistent data set .",
    "this is because those and other available colour excess values in the literature are unreliable since some of them are only assumed values , rather than a result of an investigation .",
    "@xcite maps , on the other hand , provide only the @xmath14 values according to galactic coordinates , which are modeled for any direction from sun to the edges of our galaxy as a consequence of extinction by galactic dust .",
    "those rough colour excess values according to galactic latitude ( @xmath24 ) and longitude ( @xmath25 ) towards the directions of stars are shown by @xmath26 , which symbolically means up to infinity but actually up to the edge of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the @xmath26 values have to be reduced according to the actual distance of each star . at first , a total interstellar absorption within the galaxy in the photometric @xmath27 band was computed from an available modeled value of @xmath26 for a given galactic latitude ( @xmath24 ) as    @xmath28    which could be reduced to give interstellar absorption in the @xmath27 band up to the distance @xmath29 of a cv as following @xcite @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the scaleheight for the interstellar dust which is adopted to be 100 pc as usual ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the distance of the cv is needed , but it is unknown at this point .",
    "nevertheless , a first order approximation of the distance @xmath29 , which is according to the plcs relation of @xcite relying on the observed @xmath15 and @xmath16 colours in table 1 instead of true intrinsic colours , could be used in eq . 2 for a first order estimate of the interstellar extinction in the @xmath27 band .",
    "this extinction , then , is converted to an @xmath31 value as following @xmath32 which gives the first order approximation of the colour excess @xmath14 for the associated cv .",
    "the predicted colour excess @xmath14 values by this method are given in the column 6 of table 1 .",
    "once , an approximated @xmath14 value is available for a cv , then the interstellar extinctions at @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands for it could be computed as @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 according to the equations of @xcite ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "after computing the interstellar extinctions @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the de  reddened colours @xmath21 and @xmath22 could be obtained from @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . those intrinsic colours and the orbital periods ( column 3 )",
    "were then used for computing the absolute magnitudes in column 10 of table 1 by the plcs relation of cvs .",
    "the plcs relation was established as a useful tool for predicting cv distances easily from the orbital periods and _ 2mass _ observations .",
    "after discovered by @xcite as an idea , it was calibrated and tested by the most reliable trigonometric parallaxes of 27 cvs with @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , it is especially preferred for this study over the other cv distance indicators because of its consistency , tested reliability and wide ranges of its aplicability .",
    "the open form of the plcs relation is    @xmath43    which uses intrinsic @xmath21 and @xmath22 colours and orbital periods to predict absolute magnitude of a cv .",
    "the relation was claimed to provide absolute magnitudes within the accuracy of about @xmath20.22 mag and valid for the ranges ; @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , covering the present data very well .",
    "only 15 per cent of cvs in the preliminary list is removed because of these limits when forming the list of cvs in table 1 .",
    "once absolute magnitudes in the @xmath3 band are available , the distances were then calculated by the pogson s relation as @xmath48 , where @xmath3 is observed apparent magnitude and @xmath36 is the interstellar absorption in the @xmath3 band .",
    "the distances of cvs in our sample , which are computed by the intrinsic colours , are listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "the intrinsic colours used in the plcs relation have been computed as a first order estimation as described .",
    "refinements have not been attempted since a possible correction term and its effect on the predicted distance would be too small and expected to be lost within about 10 per cent uncertainty which is equavalent to @xmath20.22 mag in the magnitude scale .",
    "disagreements between the observational and theoretical studies of cv populations could be often attributed to the incompleteness of surveys , which are mostly due to unavoidable selection effects of observational data @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the goals of cv surveys is to reduce the selection effects by observing the fainter cvs and thereby provide a more accurate picture of the actual cv population since the theory predicts the most of cvs should be intrinsically faint @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the apparent magnitude introduces a strong bias in a cv sample as the detection of faint stars is difficult .",
    "moreover , variability and amplitude of the variability are important factors which may affect the discovering probability of a cv since rare and low - amplitude erupters are harder to discover @xcite .",
    "thus , low - mass transfer rate systems are likely under - represented in the known samples of cvs because the intrinsic brightness and eruption frequency decrease with the mass transfer rate",
    ".    nevertheless , the strongest bias in the present sample may appear to be originating from the chance of finding cvs in the _",
    "2mass _ observations . because this bias mostly depends on the apparent magnitudes , it should not be counted as a new kind of bias on the studies which aim to find the space densities in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this is because the systems fainter than the limiting magnitude of the _",
    "2mass _ database are expected to be very distant objects .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the _ 2mass _ survey are 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 in @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands , respectively @xcite . therefore , we had to remove 114 systems from our primary sample , which was including more than 640 systems , as they do not exist in the _",
    "2mass _ database mostly because they are dimmer than the limiting magnitudes . additionally , we had to remove 46 systems more from the preliminary sample due to the application limits of the plcs relation concerned with the de - reddened colour indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as well ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "another important bias in our sample is introduced by the orbital periods .",
    "although this bias is magnitude dependent too , it could be counted as one of the biases that stands out independently because it is easier to measure shorter periods .",
    "the selection effects due to the orbital periods are more pronounced for magnetic systems since these objects are preferred in the follow - up observations to measure the orbital period @xcite . it should be noted that the upper and lower application limits of the plcs relation concerned with the orbital period ( see section 2.2 ) do not introduce an additional bias in the cv sample of this study , because almost all cvs with known orbital periods are included in the period limits of the plcs relation .    only 24 stars were removed because of the period limits of the plcs relation .",
    "the cvs discovered in globular clusters were removed from the sample , as well .",
    "after these removing processes , the number of systems in the final sample drops to 459 .",
    "table 1 contains all of the cvs in the final sample .",
    "the orbital period distribution of cvs in the final sample is shown in figure 1 . shaded and",
    "white areas in figure 1 show the samples with the limiting apparent magnitudes of @xmath49=15.8 and 16.5 , respectively . among the all systems",

    "although the cv sample in this study is not free from the selection effects , it is the largest sample which has ever been appeared in the literature .",
    "our sample includes @xmath972 per cent of cvs with known orbital periods .",

    "exponential functions have usually been used to derive the galactic model parameters of the galactic disc . however",
    ", a recent study has shown that the observed vertical distribution in the galaxy is smoother in the solar neighbourhood and it is well - approximated by a secans hiperbolicus function @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to derive scaleheights of cv populations in the solar neighbourhood , we have preferred to test following two functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 for describing the number density variation of cvs by the distance from the galactic disc .",
    "when choosing the best function to describe actual cv distribution in the solar neigbourhood , the galactic model parameters ( @xmath58 and a scaleheight ) were determined for both of the functions first and then their fits , that is , abilities of describing actual distribution are compared by a minimum @xmath59 test .",
    "consequently , @xmath58 is the number density of cvs in the galactic plane , @xmath0 is the distance from the galactic plane and is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath24 is the galactic latitude of the cv and @xmath61 is the distance of sun from the galactic plane ( 24 pc , * ? ? ? * ) . @xmath17 and @xmath62 are the exponential and @xmath1 vertical scaleheights , respectively .",
    "the relation between the exponential scaleheight @xmath17 and the @xmath1 scaleheight @xmath62 is @xmath63 @xcite . because recent surveys show that the radial scalelength of the thin disc stars is longer than 2.25 kpc @xcite , we have not attempted to estimate the radial scalelength of cvs since @xmath64 per cent of systems in our sample are closer than @xmath91 kpc in the @xmath65@xmath54-plane ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "we conclude that the present luminosity function of cvs in this study for @xmath84 is reasonably compatible with the luminosity function of da white dwarfs obtained from aat survey .",

    "the spatial distribution , galactic model parameters and luminosity function of cvs for the solar neighbourhood have been derived . in computing the cv distances , a new method suggested by @xcite , which uses orbital periods and intrinsic _ 2mass _ infrared colours ,",
    "was adopted .",
    "this new method advantageously allowed us to collect a fairly homogeneous sample of cvs regarding to the distances .      according to figure 3 and table 2 ,",
    "most cvs appear to be closer than 1 kpc to the sun , while they are located within the galactic disc with @xmath0 distances not higher than 0.5 kpc from the galactic plane , in general .",
    "novae are strongly concentrated towards the galactic plane .",
    "consequently , it might be concluded that because novae share the same galactic regions with the young - thin disc population , they could as well be members of the young population .",
    "such a result would be in agreement with that of @xcite who suggested that most novae come from fairly young stellar progenitors ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as for the spatial distribution of other cv types , the homogeneous spatial distribution of dwarf novae and nova - like stars implies that these systems are formed both in young and old populations in the galactic disc ( see figure 3 ) . according to @xcite , the velocity distribution of cvs indicates that they are an old disc population , with a mix of ages up to 10 gyr .",
    "clarification of this point , however , requires further work on the space velocity dispersions of cvs and their subgroups .",
    "our forthcoming work will be dedicated to studying the space velocity fields and kinematical ages of cvs .",
    "the @xmath0-histograms for the nova - like stars and polars are well represented by the @xmath1 functions , while the @xmath0-histograms of dwarf novae are well fitted by an exponential function . in observational and theoretical population studies of cvs ,",
    "usually an exponential distribution function has been assumed .",
    "however , it should be noted that the observed vertical distribution concerning the stars of all kinds in the galaxy is flat , and better - approximated by a @xmath1 function @xcite .",
    "it has been found in this study that the exponential vertical scaleheights of cvs are 158 and 179 pc for the limiting apparent magnitudes of 15.8 and 16.5 , respectively .",
    "these values are compatible with the exponential scaleheights in the range of 100 - 250 pc and 160 - 230 pc suggested by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . on the other hand ,",

    "these values are very much comparable with the scaleheight of @xmath9155 pc determined by @xcite for the polars .",
    "finally , we have found that the exponential vertical scaleheight of dwarf novae is 128 and 150 pc for the two limiting apparent magnitudes .",
    "the first of these values is in agreement with the scaleheight of 119@xmath29 pc given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that 10 to 100 undetected cvs should be hiding in the local vicinity ( 50 pc ) of the sun .",
    "according to our analysis , if the @xmath0 distribution of cvs is modeled by an exponential function , there should be about 50 undetected systems in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "however , if the @xmath0 distribution of cvs is modeled by a @xmath1 function , as indicated in figures 5 and 6 , we would only miss at most 10 cvs in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "consequently , we could claim that the discrepancies between the theoretical and observational population studies of cvs would almost be removed if the @xmath1 density function is accepted in the theoretical population studies .",
    "the local space densities calculated according to the limiting apparent magnitude of 15.8 define a lower limit .",
    "however , the local densities do not change considerably when we use the limiting apparent magnitude of 16.5 , which means that our estimates can not deviate very much from the true space densities .    according to present sample and its analysis",
    "the local space density of cvs is @xmath85 pc@xmath8 . however , former observational population studies of cvs gave predictions of space densities from @xmath10 up to @xmath86 pc@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "furthermore , @xcite argued that surveys for cvs are very incomplete , and that the space density of cvs could well be @xmath87 pc@xmath8 .",
    "however , @xcite claimed that the space density should be smaller than @xmath87 pc@xmath8 if the initial mass ratio distribution is more sharply peaked to unity .",

    "this value is in agreement with the space density of @xmath89 pc@xmath8 found by @xcite , who obtained a higher space density than the observational results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the nova - like stars in the present cv sample , we have derived a space density of @xmath90 pc@xmath8 .",
    "this value is about @xmath960 times higher than the space density of nova - like stars estimated by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "space density of novae in the present cv sample is @xmath91 pc@xmath8 .",
    "this could be interpreted as that the space density derived in this study is in agreement with @xmath92 pc@xmath8 found by @xcite , which is considerably higher than the space densities of @xmath93 and @xmath94 pc@xmath8 estimated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "one of the most important challenges of predicting the space densities is the prediction of the true distances .",
    "relying on a homogenized distance prediction , we could claim the space densities found in this study are more reliable than in the previous studies .      the luminosity function of cvs increases towards fainter absolute magnitudes .",
    "similar trends are clear for all types of cvs studied in the present sample .",
    "the luminosity function of cvs showing such a trend was first examined by @xcite .",
    "this trend clearly implies an increase in the number of short - period systems .",
    "this is a result which is roughly consistent with the theoretical prediction of @xcite , who suggested that @xmath999 per cent of all cvs should be intrinsically below the period gap .",
    "the theory predicts that most of cvs should be intrinsically faint @xcite .",
    "we have compared the luminosity function of cvs in the present study with the luminosity functions of da white dwarfs found from the aat survey by @xcite and pg survey by @xcite ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis show that the best fit between the luminosity functions of cvs and da white dwarfs can be obtained by dividing the luminosity function of da white dwarfs by 400 for the aat surveys .",
    "we conclude thereby that one cv is formed for every 400 da white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood .",
