    "<S> the absence of any concurent large frequency shifts of the observed pi phonon bleaching peaks and the brillouin - zone - center internal perovskite phonon modes measured by raman and infrared spectroscopy indicate that the polaron peak energy shift is mainly a consequence of an increase of the electron phonon coupling constant with decreasing ionic radius @xmath5 on the perovskite a site . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the dynamical lattice effects strongly contribute to the electronic band narrowing with decreasing @xmath6 in doped giant magnetoresistance manganites .    </S>",

    "<S> . however it has been shown experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite that also dynamic lattice effects including jahn - teller ( jt ) polaron formation are crucial ingredients for the explanation of gmr in manganites@xcite . in this picture @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> also strongly depends on the electron - phonon ( ep ) coupling in addition to the hopping matrix element @xmath11 and any change in the ep coupling as function of @xmath5 contributes to changes of @xmath13 and other physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally an increase of the ep coupling with decreasing @xmath5 is suggested by the shift of the @xmath14-ev polaronic peak in optical conductivity of manganites to higher energy with decreasing @xmath5@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the peak position of the 1-ev peak does not depend on the polaron binding energy alone@xcite and the magnitude of the shift can not be directly linked to change of the ep coupling constant @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we observed a polaronic photoinduced ( pi ) absorption peak in antiferromagnetic ( lamn)@xmath0o@xmath2 ( lmo).@xcite in this case the peak position is directly linked to the anti - jahn - teller polaron@xcite binding energy and enables us to _ measure directly _ the change of the electron - phonon coupling with @xmath12 in undoped gmr manganites . </S>",
    "<S> here we present photoinduced ( pi ) absorption measurements in ( ndmn)@xmath0o@xmath2 ( nmo ) with @xmath16 . </S>",

    "<S> the absence of any concurrent large frequency shifts of the observed pi phonon bleaching peaks and the brillouin - zone - center internal perovskite phonon modes measured by raman and infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy indicate that the polaron energy increase with decreasing @xmath5 is mainly a consequence of an increase of the electron - phonon coupling constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the method of preparation and characterization of ceramic sample with nominal composition ( lamn)@xmath0o@xmath2 has been published elsewhere@xcite . the sample with nominal composition ( ndmn)@xmath0o@xmath2 was prepared in a similar manner with equal final treatment at 900@xmath17c for 300 min in ar flow@xcite to decrease cation deficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray difraction patterns of both samples taken before ar treatment in 2@xmath18 range 20@xmath19 - 70@xmath20 showed that both samples are single phase . </S>",
    "<S> the samples showed no sign of a ferromagnetic transition in ac susceptibility measurements and we concluded that @xmath21 is sufficiently small that both are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and insulating below their respective neel temperatures@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> raman spectra were measured at room temperature in a standard backscatering configuration from ceramic powders using a cw kr@xmath25-ion - laser light at 647.1 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered light was analysed with a spex triple spectrometer and detected with a princeton instruments ccd array . </S>",
    "<S> the incident laser flux was kept below @xmath3400 w/@xmath24 to avoid laser annealing.@xcite    the low temperature ( @xmath26k ) pi transmittance @xmath27 spectra of both samples are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . in both samples a strong broad pi midinfrared ( mir ) absorption ( negative pi transmittance ) centered at @xmath285000 @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ev ) in lmo and at @xmath31 @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ev ) in nmo is observed .    in the frequency range of the phonon bands ( insert of fig.1 ) we observe pi phonon bleaching in the range of the 585-@xmath29 ( 576 @xmath29 in nmo ) ir phonon band and a slight pi absorption below @xmath28580 @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the pi phonon bleaching in nmo is similar to lmo@xcite , but shifted to higher frequency by @xmath2820 @xmath29 and it consists of two peaks at 620 and 690 @xmath29 with a dip in - between at 660 @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to lmo this two pi transmission peaks are reproducible among different runs , while the structure of the pi absorption below @xmath28580 @xmath29 is not , and presumably arises due to increasing instrumental noise at the lower end of the spectral range . despite the noise </S>",
    "<S> a slight pi absorption below @xmath28580 @xmath29 can be deduced from the pi spectra .    the raman spectra shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b are consistent with published data.@xcite in the 100 - 900-@xmath29 frequency range 5 phonon peaks are observed in lmo and 6 phonon peaks in nmo . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies and assignments of the phonon peaks are shown in table i. the only mode that shifts substantially is the @xmath33 mode that corresponds to the out of phase rotation of the mno@xmath2 octahedra.@xcite the mode frequency increases by 17% to 329 @xmath29 in nmo.@xcite the two high frequency modes that are expected to be related to the collective jt distortion@xcite shift by less than 5 @xmath29 , which is less than 1 % . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the frequencies of ir modes shown in table ii do not shift more than 6 % when la@xmath4 is replaced with nd@xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> a fit of absorption due to a small polaron hopping given by emin @xcite to the data is shown in fig . 1 for both samples assuming that @xmath35 is proportional to the absorption coefficient@xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath38 is the polaron binding energy , @xmath39 the incoming photon frequency and @xmath40 the polaron phonon frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction fits well to the data with the small polaron binding energies @xmath41 ev and @xmath42ev in lmo and nmo samples respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the polaron binding energies @xmath38 and polaron phonon frequencies @xmath40 obtained from the fit are summarized in table iii .    </S>",
    "<S> the polaron phonon frequencies @xmath40 obtained from the fit are 310 and 330 @xmath29 in lmo and nmo respectively and are small compared to the frequencies of the jt related raman modes at @xmath28 490 @xmath43 this discrepancy is not surprising , since the width of the peak in ( [ eqemin ] ) , from which @xmath40 is determined , includes a prefactor which strongly depends on the details of the phonon cloud in the small polaron and is 4 only in a 1d holstein model , which is a molecular model with a single dispersionless phonon . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the prefactor as well as dispersion and multiplicity of the phonon branches , @xmath40 can be viewed as an _ effective polaron phonon frequency _ of the different wavevector phonons in the phonon cloud .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the observed pi absorption peak indicates that the ep coupling is strong and @xmath44 , since otherwise one does not expect to observe a symmetric and structureless peak in optical conductivity.@xcite in this case the polaron binding energy is proportional to@xcite @xmath45 here @xmath15 is the dimensionless ep coupling constant , @xmath11 the bare hopping matrix element and @xmath46 the number of nearest neighbours . in this formula again @xmath15 and @xmath40 should be viewed as effective quantities corresponding to the combination of different wavevector phonons in the polaron phonon cloud . from formula ( [ epol ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that @xmath38 is very sensitive to changes of the ep coupling constant @xmath15 and @xmath47 , but depends on the bare hopping matrix element @xmath11 only in the second order , since in the strong coupling limit @xmath48 .    in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> one can see from raman and ir spectra that , apart from the @xmath33-mode frequency which corresponds to the out of phase rotation of the mno@xmath2 octahedra , all the observed brillouin - zone - center - phonon frequencies shift by no more than a few percent when la@xmath4 is replaced by nd@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this would at a first sight suggest a link between the @xmath33 octahedral rotation mode , especially because the effective polaron phonon frequencies @xmath40 obtained from the fit are very close to the observed mode frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> hardening of the phonon mode by 17% and the @xmath4944% increase of observed small polaron energy would in this case according to ( [ epol ] ) imply a @xmath314% increase of the ep coupling constant @xmath50    however , as stated above , the effective polaron phonon frequencies obtained from the fit are extremly inaccurate due to a crudness of the holstein model and , since the small - polaron phonon cloud due to its localised nature includes mainly large wavevector phonons , the effective @xmath40 only weakly depends on the frequency of the zone center phonons . in addition , the observed pi phonon bleaching peaks , which are expected to be directly related to the nonzero wavevector phonons forming the polaron phonon cloud , harden by a mere @xmath33% . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that it is _ very unlikely _ that the frequency shift of the @xmath33 mode , which corresponds to the out of phase rotation of the mno@xmath2 octahedra , is directly related to the observed small polaron binding energy shift .    </S>",
    "<S> instead we attribute the @xmath3_44% increase of the polaron binding energy to a _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3_20% increase of the ep coupling constant _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 when la@xmath4is replaced by nd@xmath4and not to a change of @xmath40 and/or the bare hopping matrix element @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by a small shift of the observed pi phonon bleaching peaks and , nevertheless , the negligible shift of the relevant brillouine zone center phonon modes , especialy the raman - active high frequency ones , which have been shown to be related to the collective jt distortion@xcite .    the influence of a decrease of the bare hopping matrix element @xmath11 with decreasing @xmath5 on the polaron binding energy can be neglected due to its second order nature in ( [ epol ] ) , since a decrease of @xmath11 with decreasing @xmath5 in ( [ epol ] ) would lead to a decrease of @xmath38 , which is the _ opposite _ to what is experimentally observed .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a @xmath344% increase of the anti - jahn - teller polaron binding energy when la@xmath4is replaced by smaller nd@xmath4 in undoped gmr manganites . </S>",
    "<S> absence of any concurent large frequency shifts of the observed pi phonon bleaching peaks and the brillouin - zone - center perovskite internal phonon modes indicate that the increase of the polaron binding energy is a consequence of increasing electron - phonon coupling strength with decreasing ionic radius on the perovskite a site . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be safely extrapolated to doped manganites as indicated by the shift of the 1-ev polaronic peak with decreasing @xmath5 in optical conductivity of gmr manganites@xcite and increasing isotope effect of @xmath10 with decreasing @xmath5@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the effective bandwidth resulting in decrease of the curie temperature @xmath10 and increase of the size of magnetoresistance with decreasing @xmath5 is suggested to be , not just due to the direct influence of mn - o - mn bond angles on the bare hopping matrix element @xmath11,@xcite but also a consequence of the increasing polaronic band narrowing due to increasing electron phonon coupling .    </S>",
