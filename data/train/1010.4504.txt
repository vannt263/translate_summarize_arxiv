    "the covariance graph ( aka bi - directed graph ) of a probability distribution @xmath0 is the undirected graph @xmath1 where two nodes are adjacent iff their corresponding random variables are marginally dependent in @xmath0 .",
    "covariance graphs were introduced in @xcite to represent independence models . since then , they have received considerable attention .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite are particularly important for the interpretation of covariance graphs in terms of independencies . specifically , these works introduce a graphical criterion for reading independencies from the covariance graph @xmath1 of a probability distribution @xmath0 , under the assumption that @xmath0 satisfies the graphoid properties and composition . in this paper , we show that @xmath1 can also be used to read dependencies holding in @xmath0 . specifically , we present a graphical criterion for reading dependencies from @xmath1 under the assumption that @xmath0 satisfies the graphoid properties , weak transitivity and composition .",
    "we also prove that our graphical criterion is sound and complete . here",
    ", complete means that it is able to read all the dependencies in @xmath0 that can be derived by applying the graphoid properties , weak transitivity and composition to the dependencies used in the construction of @xmath1 and the independencies obtained from @xmath1 .",
    "we also show that there exist important families of probability distributions that satisfy the graphoid properties , weak transitivity and composition .",
    "these include , for instance , all the regular gaussian probability distributions .",
    "note that this paper would be unnecessary if @xmath0 satifies all and only the independencies that can be read from @xmath1 via the graphical criterion in @xcite , i.e. @xmath0 is faithful to @xmath1 .",
    "we will see that one can not safely assume faithfulness in general .",
    "therefore , one is only entitled to assume that @xmath0 satifies all ( but not necessarily only ) the independencies that can be read from @xmath1 via the graphical criterion in @xcite , i.e. @xmath0 is markov wrt @xmath1 .",
    "this is actually the reason of being of this paper .",
    "two previous works that somehow address the problem of reading dependencies off covariance graphs are @xcite .",
    "these works propose to determine whether two random variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are dependent given some other random variables @xmath4 by , first , constructing the covariance graph of the conditional probability distribution given @xmath4 of any set of random variables that includes @xmath2 and @xmath3 and , then , checking if the nodes corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 are adjacent in the covariance graph constructed .",
    "therefore , these works construct multiple covariance graphs , one for each conditional probability distribution of interest , from which only the dependencies used in their construction are read .",
    "the work presented in this paper is radically different : we only construct the covariance graph of the probability distribution at hand and read from it many more dependencies than those used in its construction .",
    "while this is the first work where a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies off covariance graphs is developed , it is worth mentioning that there already exist sound and complete graphical criteria for reading dependencies off other graphical models .",
    "for instance , there exists a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies off the concentration graph ( aka minimal undirected independence map or markov network ) of a probability distribution that satisfies the graphoid properties @xcite , or the graphoid properties and weak transitivity @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the graphical criterion that we present in this paper is dual to the one in @xcite .",
    "there also exists a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies off the bayesian network ( aka minimal directed independence map ) of a probability distribution that satisfies the graphoid properties @xcite , the graphoid properties and weak transitivity @xcite , or the graphoid properties and weak transitivity and composition @xcite . in the last two references ,",
    "the bayesian networks are restricted to be polytrees .",
    "note that @xcite address a related but not more general problem than the one in this paper , since neither concentration graphs nor bayesian networks include covariance graphs .",
    "related more general problems than the one studied in this paper have been recently addressed , though . for instance , a method to read dependencies from multivariate regression graphs , which include covariance graphs , is proposed in @xcite .",
    "the author also presents necessary and sufficient conditions for the method to be sound .",
    "these conditions are the same as the ones considered in this paper , namely the graphoid properties plus weak transitivity and composition . unlike in this paper , no proof of completeness of the method proposed appears in @xcite .",
    "another related more general work is @xcite , where the author shows how summary graphs , which include covariance graphs , can help to detect which dependencies remain undistorted and which do not after marginalization and/or conditioning in a probability distribution generated over a so - called parent graph .",
    "it should be pointed out that that the probability distribution is generated over a parent graph implies that it satisfies the same conditions as the ones considered in this paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3 ) . again , unlike in this paper , the completeness question is not addressed in @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that @xcite make use of the graphical criterion presented in @xcite for reading independencies from loopless mixed graphs , which include multivariate regression graphs , summary graphs and parent graphs .",
    "this criterion is sound and complete in certain sense , given that the graphoid properties and composition hold ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) .",
    "these conditions are , in fact , not only sufficient but necessary too ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3 ) .",
    "we think that the work presented in this paper can be of great interest for the artificial intelligence community .",
    "graphs are one of the most commonly used metaphors for representing knowledge because they appeal to human intuition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , graphs are parsimonious models because they trade off accuracy for simplicity .",
    "consider , for instance , representing the independence model induced by a probability distribution as a graph .",
    "though this graph is typically less accurate than the probability distribution ( the graph may not represent all the ( in)dependencies and those that are represented are not quantified ) , it also requires less space to be stored and less time to be communicated than the probability distribution , which may be desirable features in some applications .",
    "thus , it seems sensible developing tools for reasoning with graphs .",
    "our graphical criterion is one such a tool : as the graphical criterion in @xcite makes the discovery of independencies amenable to human reasoning by enabling to read independencies off a covariance graph @xmath1 without numerical calculation , so does our graphical criterion with respect to the discovery of dependencies .",
    "there are fields where discovering dependencies is more important than discovering independencies @xcite .",
    "it is in these fields where we believe that our graphical criterion has greater potential . in bioinformatics , for instance ,",
    "the nodes of @xmath1 may represent ( the expression levels of ) some genes under study .",
    "bioinformaticians are typically more interested in discovering gene dependencies than independencies , because the former provide contexts in which the expression level of some genes is informative about that of some other genes , which may lead to hypothesize dependencies , functional relations , causal relations , the effects of manipulation experiments , etc .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite for an application of covariance graphs to bioinformatics under the name of relevance networks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing some concepts in section [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "we show in section [ sec : wtc ] that assuming the graphoid properties , weak transitivity and composition is not too restrictive .",
    "we prove in section [ sec : indep ] that the existing graphical criterion for reading independencies from covariance graphs is complete in certain sense .",
    "this result , in addition to being important in its own , is important for reading as many dependencies as possible from covariance graphs .",
    "we introduce in section [ sec : dep ] our graphical criterion for reading dependencies from covariance graphs and prove that it is sound and complete in certain sense .",
    "finally , we close with some discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "in this paper , we have provided new insight into covariance graphs by introducing a graphical criterion for reading dependencies from the covariance graph of a wtc graphoid .",
    "we have shown that wtc graphoids are not a too restrictive family of probability distributions by showing that it includes interesting discrete , gaussian , and continuous but non - gaussian probability distributions .",
    "we have proven that the new graphical criterion is sound and complete in certain sense . in order to prove these properties ,",
    "we have had to prove first that the graphical criterion in @xcite for reading independencies from the covariance graph of a wtc graphoid is complete in certain sense .",

    "this implies that every probability distribution that is faithful to @xmath1 ( recall that such probability distributions exist by theorem [ the : fcg2 ] ) is not faithful to any cg .",
    "it is fair mentioning that we are not the first to note that covariance graphs complement other more popular graphical models .",
    "for instance , it follows from @xcite that covariance graphs complement dags .",
    "our example above simply extends this observation to cgs .",
    "another consequence of the faithfulness result in theorem [ the : fcg2 ] is that it proves wrong the misconception that covariance graphs are densely connected because their edges represent marginal dependencies .",
    "specifically , the theorem implies that there are probability distributions that are faithful to any covariance graph , no matter its topology .    interestingly , the graphical criterion developed in this paper is dual to the one presented in @xcite for reading dependencies from the concentration graph of a wtc graphoid .",
    "this duality resembles the duality existing between the graphical criteria for reading independencies from concentration and covariance graphs @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the new graphical criterion and the one presented in @xcite complement each other , as there may be dependencies that only one of them can identify .",
    "finally , we have pointed out some limitations of the graphical criterion introduced in this paper that suggest future lines of research .",
    "for instance , it remains an open question whether it is possible to develop a similar graphical criterion that is complete in a stricter sense than the one used in this paper .",
    "it also remains an open question whether our faithfulness result in appendix a for regular gaussian probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability distributions with the help of the parameterizations in @xcite .",
    "another line of action is the application of our graphical criterion in bioinformatics .",
    "in such an application , the covariance graph has to be learnt from gene expression data via , for instance , hypothesis tests .",
    "the data available for learning is typically scarce due to the high cost associated with its production . in this scenario ,",
    "covariance graphs are easier to learn than bayesian networks or concentration graphs , which are the graphical models commonly used in bioinformatics , because the former involves testing for marginal ( in)dependencies whereas the latter involve testing for conditional ( in)dependencies .",
    "we do not suggest with this that one should quit using bayesian networks and concentration graphs in bioinformatics . specifically",
    ", bayesian networks have an important advantage over covariance graphs , namely that they can provide us with insight into the mechanistic or causal process underlying the data at hand .",
    "what we suggest is that when the data at hand is not considered enough to learn a reliable bayesian network , one may be willing to learn a less informative but more reliable model such as a covariance graph , particularly now that we have graphical criteria for reading both dependencies and independencies off it .",
    "note that this paper only studies the structure of covariance graphs and , thus , it does not deal with their parameterization and/or parameter estimation .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for gaussian models and @xcite for discrete models .",
    "however , it may be worth warning here that finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a covariance graph can be hard , depending on the parameterization considered .",
    "this is particularly true for discrete models @xcite .",
    "the reason is that a marginal independence can imply complicated parameter constraints in some parameterizations , because a marginal dependence is a property of the joint probability distribution rather than of the relevant marginal probability distribution .",
    "an early work that showed the latter is @xcite , where the author gives an example of two - way interactions implying three - way interaction . in summary , learning the structure of a covariance graph may be simpler than learning the structure of a concentration graph .",
    "however , estimating the parameters of the former may be harder than estimating the parameters of the latter .",
    "we strengthen the second statement in theorem [ the : fcvg ] by proving that , in certain measure - theoretic sense , almost all the regular gaussian probability distributions that are markov wrt a covariance graph are faithful to it .",
    "although this result is not used in this paper , we consider it to be interesting in its own and , thus , we decide to report on it .",
    "we start by recalling some results from matrix theory .",
