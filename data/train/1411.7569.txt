    "it is well known that if we consider a natural classical hamiltonian system on the @xmath2-dimensional ( @xmath2d ) euclidean space = t()+u ( ) , [ uno ] the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath12 and the coulomb potential @xmath13 define two _ maximally superintegrable _ ( ms ) systems ( in the liouville sense ) , since both systems are endowed with @xmath14 functionally independent and globally defined integrals of the motion . in the first case",
    "such integrals are provided by the components of the demkov ",
    "fradkin tensor  @xcite , and in the second one by the angular momenta together with the @xmath2 components of the runge ",
    "lenz vector ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . at the classical dynamical level , the footprint of superintegrability consists in the fact that all bounded trajectories of these two systems are closed ones , a fact which is diretly related with bertrand s theorem  @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the quantization of these systems is performed it is found that such superintegrability implies that their spectrum exhibits maximal degeneracy due to a superabundance of quantum integrals of the motion .    in this paper",
    "we review two spherically symmetric deformations of the oscillator and coulomb systems that define two new ms systems  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", their quantization  @xcite is shown to present maximal degeneracy in the spectra . at a first sight",
    ", the existence of such deformations could seem impossible since the only spherically symmetric potentials on the euclidean space that are ms are just the oscillator and the coulomb ones .",
    "therefore , the addition of any radial perturbation on these systems leads to superintegrability breaking and thus to a lack of maximal degeneracy in the spectra , a fact that is very well known in quantum perturbation theory .",
    "however , as we shall see , such superintegrable perturbations can be obtained if _ both the potential and the kinetic energy _ are simultaneously deformed in a very precise way .",
    "explicitly , the hamiltonian   will be smoothly deformed into _ ( , ) = t_(,)+u _ ( ) , [ dos ] where @xmath15 can be regarded as a ( generic ) _ deformation parameter _ in such a manner that we will be no longer working on the _ flat _ euclidean space , but on a suitable curved space with metric and kinetic energy given by @xmath16 this fact will provide additional interesting geometric features to the systems we will deal with . in particular , we will see that the curved / deformed generalization of the demkov  fradkin tensor and of the runge  lenz vector do exist , and will be the essential tool to prove the ms property of the deformed systems .",
    "we recall that the quantization problem on curved spaces is clearly a non - trivial one , since the kinetic energy term @xmath17 is a function of both positions and momenta that creates severe ordering ambiguities .",
    "nevertheless , we shall explicitly show that a quantization of @xmath18 ( [ dos ] ) that preserves the ms property is achieved through the _ conformal laplacian quantization _",
