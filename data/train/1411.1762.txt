    "most galaxies are believed to host central massive black holes ( mbh ) @xcite . in the hierarchical merger paradigm ,",
    "galaxies in the universe typically experience several major and multiple minor mergers in their lifetime , and every such merger results in the eventual formation of mbh binary .",
    "the evolutionary stages of mbh binary were outlined in @xcite :    * the merger of two galaxies creates a common nucleus ; both mbh sink to the center of the merger remnant due to dynamical friction and form a binary ( distance @xmath1  pc , all estimates are given for a @xmath2 black hole ) .",
    "the two black holes are considered a binary when they start to `` feel '' each other ( their mutual gravitational force is larger than the force from the rest of the galaxy ) . *",
    "three - body interactions between the mbh binary and the stars of galactic nucleus eject stars from the vicinity of the binary , and form a depleted zone , or `` mass deficit '' @xcite , in the nucleus ( which indeed has been identified in several galaxies , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the initial stage of this process is very rapid and leads to a decrease of the binary s semimajor axis @xmath3 by a factor of few to ten ( @xmath4  pc ) .",
    "* once the binary becomes hard and expels almost all stars that ever come close to the binary , its subsequent shrinking could slow down considerably , and could even last longer than the hubble time  a situation that has been called the `` final - parsec problem '' @xcite . *",
    "if , despite all troubles , the binary shrinks to a separation @xmath5  pc , the emission of gravitational waves ( gw ) becames the dominant mechanism that extracts the energy from the binary , leading to its rapid coalescence ( @xmath6  pc )",
    ".    a star passing at a distance @xmath7 from the binary will experience a complex 3-body interaction which results in ejection of the star with a larger velocity than it had before the interaction ( the slingshot effect ) .",
    "these stars carry away energy and angular momentum from the binary , so that its semimajor axis @xmath3 decreases : @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , if density of field stars @xmath9 remains constant ( their velocity dispersion @xmath10 usually does ) , the binary hardens with a constant rate .",
    "however , the reservoir of low angular momentum stars ( so - called loss cone  stars that have small enough pericenter distances and can be ejected ) is finite and is depleted rather quickly .",
    "the subsequent evolution depends on the rate of the loss - cone repopulation .",
    "the classical loss - cone theory was developed in application to the problem of star capture by a single mbh ( e.g.   @xcite , see also a recent review in @xcite ) . in the case of a binary mbh",
    ", the loss - cone boundary is defined by the radius of binary s orbit rather than the radius of capture of tidal disruption ( and therefore is much larger ) . in terms of angular momentum @xmath11 of a star",
    ", the boundary corresponds to @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ; most stars entering the loss cone are on highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath14 , where the latter quantity is the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same energy ) .",
    "the stars inside the loss cone are eliminated within one orbital period @xmath15 .",
    "the crucial parameter for the evolution is the timescale for repopulation of the loss cone . in the absence of other processes ,",
    "the repopulation time is a small fraction of the two - body relaxation time : @xmath16 if @xmath17 , the loss cone is full ( refilled faster than orbital period ) . in real galaxies , however , the opposite regime applies  the empty loss cone . in this case",
    "the hardening rate is much lower : @xmath18 .",
    "relaxation is too slow for an efficient repopulation of the loss cone : in the absense of other processes the binary would not merge in a hubble time .",
    "there are several possible ways to enhance the loss - cone repopulation and hardening rate of the binary :    * _ brownian motion _ of the binary enables its interaction with a larger number of stars @xcite .",
    "* _ time - dependent solution _ of the fokker - planck equation describing the diffusion of stars in angular momentum generally yields a higher loss - cone repopulation rate at the initial stage of evolution due to steeper gradients in the phase space distribution of stars @xcite . * _ secondary slingshot _ allows stars scattered by the binary with velocities lower than escape velocity to return to the galaxy center and interact with the binary more than once @xcite , although this effect seems to be suppressed in non - spherical systems due to non - radial trajectories of ejected stars @xcite . *",
    "_ gas _ in the circumbinary accretion disk may increase the dissipation of binary s binding energy , however , its effect may be rather difficult to model and it is not guaranteed to solve the hardening problem @xcite ; moreover , this factor does not apply for dry mergers ( gas - poor galaxies ) which are the subject of this study . * _ perturbations _ from a possible third black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may increase the binary eccentricity due to the kozai - lidov mechanism , thereby driving it into gw - dominated regime sooner ; other massive objects such as giant molecular clouds @xcite may substantially increase the two - body relaxation rate and efficiently scatter stars into the loss cone . * _ non - spherical _ shape of the merger remnant gives rise to torques that change stars angular momenta and have been proposed as a possible mechanism that keeps the loss cone full @xcite .",
    "let us explain the last point in more detail .",
    "if the distribution of stars and the gravitational potential that they generate is not exactly spherical , then the angular momentum @xmath11 of any star is not conserved , but experiences oscillations due to torques from the non - spherical potential .",
    "the period of these oscillations is a few times @xmath15 , and their amplitude depends on the degree of flattening , as well as on the average value of @xmath11 ( stars with @xmath19 tend to have larger variations in @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , due to non - spherical torques , a much larger number of stars can attain low values of @xmath11 and enter the loss cone at some point in their ( collisionless ) evolution , regardless of two - body relaxation . in the axisymmetric potential , one component of @xmath11 parallel to the symmetry axis ( @xmath20 )",
    "is conserved , therefore the total angular momentum can not become smaller than @xmath20 ; still , there are many more stars with @xmath21 than stars in the loss cone ( with the instantaneous value of @xmath22 ) , and a large fraction of them can eventually attain @xmath22 . in the triaxial case",
    ", there is an entire population of centrophilic orbits such as pyramids and chaotic orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  1g , a ) , that can achieve arbitrary low values of @xmath11  all of them could eventually enter the loss cone , although not all manage to do so in a hubble time .",
    "these considerations have led to a conclusion that the loss cone should remain full in axisymmetric and especially triaxial systems .",
    "simulations of binary mbh evolution initially focused on the spherical case , starting the evolution from a near - equilibrium stellar system with two embedded black holes before or just after the formation of the binary . at present",
    ", it seems impossible to evolve an @xmath0-body system with a number of particles comparable to that of a real galactic nucleus ( @xmath23 ) , therefore all studies to date used a much smaller number of particles @xmath24 and extrapolated the results to a real galaxy . from the analytical estimates outlined above ,",
    "it is clear that the evolution of the binary mbh in a real galaxy of spherical shape should occur in an empty - loss - cone regime . in this case",
    ", we expect the hardening rate of the binary ( proportional to the repopulation rate of the loss cone ) to scale with the number of particles in the simulation as @xmath25 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the empty - loss - cone regime is not so easy to achieve ",
    "@xmath0 should be large enough so that even a very small fraction of the relaxation time is still much longer than the dynamical time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 15 , for quantitative estimates of the minimum required @xmath0 ) . in the early studies",
    "@xcite , this was not possible and the hardening rate was almost independent of @xmath0  a signature of the full - loss - cone regime .",
    "later simulations with a larger @xmath0 have confirmed that the hardening rate drops with @xmath0 if it is large enough @xcite . at the same time , studies that considered a flattened model for the nucleus @xcite or a merger simulation that resulted in a non - spherical remnant @xcite indicated no dependence of the hardening rate on @xmath0 , which was found to be rather close to the full - loss - cone hardening rate . it was inferred that the departure from spherical symmetry was strong enough that the enhanced rate of angular momentum mixing sustains a full loss cone .",
    "however , it remains to be proved that the apparent @xmath0-independence of the hardening rate in merger simulations is the result of non - spherical shape and not of some other physical process , such as an initially enhanced fraction of stars on radial orbits , or incomplete mixing of the large - scale structure of the merger remnant that could create time - dependent variations in the potential , again enhancing the angular momentum mixing .",
    "recently , two papers attemted a `` controlled experiment '' by exploring the binary evolution in a system constructed to be initially in equilibrium .",
    "rather disappointingly , they have reached conflicting conclusions : while @xcite have found the hardening rate in their axisymmetric models to be @xmath0-independent , @xcite have shown the rate to depend on @xmath0 quite significantly in the axisymmetric and even triaxial geometry , although not as strongly as in the spherical case ( figure  [ fig : hardening_rate ] ) .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy remain obscure , but may have something to do with the different methods used for preparing the initial conditions for the models : `` adiabatic squeezing '' technique @xcite in the former paper and schwarzschild modelling in the latter one .     as functions of the number of particles @xmath0 in simulations done in three geometries : spherical ( red circles ) , axisymmetric ( green squares ) and triaxial ( blue triangles ) . this figure is an updated version of the one presented in @xcite , which in additions includes the results of simulations with @xmath26 .",
    "it demonstrates that in all three cases the hardening rate does depend on @xmath0 , although less so for non - spherical systems ; there is a hint for levelling off at the highest @xmath0 in the triaxial case . in all three cases",
    "it remains substantially lower than the full - loss - cone rate for high enough @xmath0 . ]",
    "the latter paper also have demonstrated that it is indeed very difficult to properly isolate the effect of loss - cone repopulation caused by non - spherical torques , because in an @xmath0-body simulation with a feasible number of particles ( @xmath27 ) it is strongly contaminated by the artificially enhanced two - body relaxation , thought to be unimportant in real galaxies .",
    "thus a robust extrapolation of the result of simulation to much higher @xmath0 remains a very challenging task .",
    "for instance , can we trust the hints of levelling off of @xmath0-dependence of hardening rate in the triaxial model at @xmath28 in figure  [ fig : hardening_rate ] ?",
    "these simulations have also been conducted for a much shorter interval of time than is necessary to lead the binary into the gw - dominated regime , and it is not certain that the hardening rate stays constant with time . therefore ,",
    "unless we can afford much higher values of @xmath0 and longer simulation intervals , the answer to the question whether the final - parsec problem exists in non - spherical galaxies would remain elusive .",
    "it is clear that at present time conventional @xmath0-body simulations can not reach the required regime in which collisional ( relaxation ) effects are minor compared to collisionless ( non - spherical ) ones .",
    "fortunately , there exist a technique that allows to reliably model the collisional evolution of stellar systems with much cheaper computational demand than a direct @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "this is the monte carlo method of stellar dynamics , pioneered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is based on the standard two - body relaxation theory , which predicts the statistical effect of many individual encounters on the trajectory of a given star , without the need to simulate these encounters explicitly .",
    "these methods have been continuously developed up to the present time and are successfully applied to various problems of dynamical evolution of star clusters @xcite and galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the mentioned independent implementations are based on the hnon s formulation of the monte carlo method , which relies substantially on the assumption of spherical geometry ; the alternative spitzer s formulation is free from this assumption , although historically has been used only in a spherical case .",
    "we have developed a novel monte carlo method based on spitzer s work , which can be applied in any geometry and can explicitly distinguish the collisionless and collisional effects .",
    "the detailed description of the method is given in @xcite , here we outline its main features .",
    "the evolution of an @xmath0-body system is followed by a hybrid approach combining a temporally smoothed extension of the self - consistent field method @xcite with a prescription for relaxation in terms of position - dependent velocity perturbations , based on spitzer s original formulation of the monte carlo method .",
    "the orbits of particles are followed in a smooth , non - spherical potential represented by a suitable basis - set expansion ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a high - accuracy adaptive - timestep orbit integrator .",
    "after each integrator timestep , the particle velocity is perturbed using velocity diffusion coefficients computed from a spherical isotropic distribution function that approximates the true distribution of particles .",
    "the amplitude of this perturbation can be scaled to mimic the relaxation rate of a target stellar system that is composed of @xmath29 stars ; this number is not related to the actual number of particles in the simulation and can be set at will , in particular , turning off the relaxation entirely corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "orbits of all particles are integrated in parallel , independently from each other , for an interval of time ( `` episode '' ) that can be comparable or even much longer than @xmath15 , although should be @xmath31 . at the end of the episode ,",
    "the system state ( coefficients of expansion of the non - spherical potential , and the spherical approximation to the distribution function ) is updated using trajectories of particles sampled during the entire episode .",
    "the main advantages of the algorithm are the much lower computational demand than a full @xmath0-body simulation ( it scales linearly with @xmath0 , since the motion of each particle depends only on the mean - field potential and the global distribution function , but not on explicit interactions with other particles ) , the possibility of scaling the relaxation rate to the desired level independently from @xmath0 , and the ability to deal with potentials of arbitrary shape .",
    "the application of this method to the problem of binary mbh evolution is based on the conservation approach @xcite . during each episode",
    ", particles are moving in the combined potential of the stellar cluster and the time - dependent potential of the binary mbh . at each close encounter of the particle with the binary ,",
    "we record the change of energy and angular momentum of the particle ; at the end of the episode , these changes are summed up , and the orbit of the binary is adjusted using the conservation law for energy and angular momentum .",
    "this procedure captures most relevant dynamical processes in the nucleus , such as the depletion and repopulation of the loss cone , secondary slingshot , and change of shape of the stellar potential , although it does not account for the influence of brownian motion of the binary . in this preliminary study ,",
    "we focus on equal - mass binaries on circular orbits and do not follow the evolution of the eccentricity , which is expected to remain low throughout the evolution for these conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in @xmath0-body simulations of @xcite ( red curve , extending up to @xmath32 ) and in monte carlo calculations which included relaxation at the amplitude corresponding to the @xmath33 particle system from the @xmath0-body simulation ( green curve , upper ) or without relaxation ( blue curve , lower ) . the thick red dot marks @xmath34 as the initial moment for the monte carlo calculations .",
    "top row shows short - term evolution , which demonstrates the qualitative agreement between monte carlo and @xmath0-body simulations ; bottom row is for long - term evolution .",
    "left , central and right panels show three geometries  spherical , axisymmetric , and triaxial . only in the latter case",
    "the binary continues to shrink at an appreciable rate even without relaxation , although this rate is several times lower than the full - loss - cone rate shown as dot - dashed line . in the other two cases , the binary evolution without relaxation stalls at a separation just a few times smaller than the initial value of @xmath3 , due to depletion of loss - cone orbits . on the other hand , with the relaxation rate corresponding to @xmath33 ( state - of - the - art @xmath0-body simulations ) , there is considerable evolution in all three geometries , demonstrating that the @xmath0-body simulations can not yet reach the dynamical regime relevant for real galaxies . ]",
    "we start our monte carlo simulations from snapshots taken at @xmath34 in the @xmath0-body simulations of @xcite , when the hard binary has already formed .",
    "we follow the evolution of the system in three cases ( spherical , axisymmetric , and triaxial , with the last two systems having initial axis ratios of 1:1:0.8 and 1:0.9:0.8 ) , with two choices of the relaxation rate : corresponding to a @xmath33 particle system ( the same as the original simulations ) and without relaxation ( the situation relevant to real galaxies ) .",
    "the results of this calculation , in terms of the evolution of inverse semimajor axis of the binary , are presented in figure  [ fig : hardness_evolution ] .",
    "first of all , it confirms that the monte carlo method yields consistent results with direct @xmath0-body simulations , if the relaxation amplitude is scaled to the same level as in these simulations .",
    "second , in the presence of relaxation the evolution continues with roughly the same hardening rate for much longer intervals of time , and there is indeed only a factor of two difference between three geometries at @xmath33 .",
    "third , and most importantly , it suggests that without relaxation , in the spherical and axisymmetric cases the evolution of binary semimajor axis @xmath3 slows down and eventually stalls at a distance only a few times smaller than the initial value of @xmath3 , although it occurs later and at smaller distance in the axisymmetric case .",
    "by contrast , in the triaxial case the evolution continues without any relaxation at a rate which is just twice lower than the rate at @xmath33 .",
    "the difference between the geometries is explained by the properties of orbits : as mentioned above , in the axisymmetric case there are more orbits that can enter the loss cone due to the variation in angular momentum caused by non - spherical torques than in the spherical case , where no such torques exist .",
    "however , the minimum value of angular momentum for any orbit is still non - zero in the axisymmetric geometry , and as the size of the loss cone shrinks proportionally with the binary separation , eventually all such orbits are depleted . by contrast , in the triaxial case the population of genuinely centrophilic orbits , all of them being able to achieve arbitrary low values of angular momentum , is large enough to sustain a steady influx of stars into the loss cone .",
    "it is remarkable that the hardening rate in this case is about an order of magnitude lower than the full - loss - cone rate ; nevertheless , scaled to real galaxies , it appears to be sufficient to drive the binary to the merger in a time much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "we have reviewed the evolution of binary massive black holes in gas - free galaxies , focusing on the final - parsec problem  the difficulty to keep the shrinking rate of the binary at a high enough level for it to merge in a hubble time .",
    "this problem is connected to the rate of repopulation of the loss cone ",
    "region of phase space occupied by stars that are able to interact with the binary . in",
    "non - spherical galaxies this repopulation occurs both due to collisionless effects  variations of angular momentum of stars due to torques from the global potential , and to collisional effects  two - body relaxation . in real galaxies ,",
    "collisional effects are supposed to play a very small role , however , in existing @xmath0-body simulations their contribution is greatly enhanced due to a limited number of particles .",
    "we have introduced a novel monte carlo method that is suitable for the dynamical evolution of non - spherical galactic nuclei and can explicitly adjust the relaxation rate .",
    "preliminary calculations for equal - mass binary on a circular orbit suggest that in the absense of relaxation , the shrinking of the orbit stalls ( the final - parsec problem exists ) in spherical and axisymmetric systems , but not in the triaxial ones . in the future",
    ", we are going to apply the method for unequal - mass binaries , which are expected to develop substantial eccentricity that accelerates the transition to the gw - dominated regime @xcite .",
    "an open question is why merger simulations seem to imply the evolution rate comparable with the full - loss - cone rate , while our isolated systems never approach this rate for sufficiently high @xmath0 ; we are going to address it by running monte carlo simulations using merger remnants as initial conditions .",
    "another interesting question is the rate of tidal disruptions of stars by either component of the binary at different evolutionary stages ; this process can also be included in the monte carlo code .",
    "this work was partly supported by the national aeronautics and space administration under grant no .",
