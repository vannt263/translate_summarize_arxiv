    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are powered by accretion onto a massive black hole ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the fuel itself is probably ism from the host galaxy that is driven to the center by bar - induced torques @xcite , galaxy interactions , or galaxy mergers ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "starbursts may be an inevitable consequence of the gas infall @xcite , and the observed relation between black hole mass and host bulge mass in agns suggests that nuclear activity is closely connected to star formation @xcite .",
    "nuclear activity , though probably short - lived compared with the lifetime of the host ( @xmath25  20% percent of galaxies host agn ; @xcite ) , may be an integral part of the evolution of all galaxies .",
    "understanding the inner workings of agns and the agn / starburst connection is therefore important for understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "seyfert galaxies are the nearest and brightest agns and so are well - suited for studying the connection between nuclear activity and star formation .",
    "obscuring dust however hampers studies of the optical  soft x - ray emission produced by young stars and the accretion disk .",
    "emission at infrared wavelengths does not suffer such large extinction , and , further , the dust that absorbs the shorter wavelength emission reradiates in the ir and correspondingly produces a substantial fraction of the bolometric flux of the object . dissecting the detailed ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of seyfert galaxies can reveal the properties of the dust in the nuclear region as well as place constraints on the optical  soft x - ray spectrum ( i.e. , starburst and agn spectrum ) that heats the dust .",
    "a key factor in understanding seyfert galaxies is determining the geometry of the nuclear obscuring material .",
    "unification schemes postulate that the observed differences between seyfert types 1 and 2 , such as optical emission line widths and x - ray spectral slopes , are due to orientation - dependent obscuration ( see reviews by @xcite ) . alternatively , there may be fundamental differences between the central engines of  and .",
    "the obscuring medium has been modeled as a dusty torus which , viewed edge - on ( ) , obscures the nucleus but , viewed face - on ( ) , allows the nucleus to be seen .",
    "the inner scale of the torus is thought to be of order 1  pc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but other properties are poorly constrained owing to angular resolution limitations .",
    "however , the geometry and equatorial opacity of the torus should have an observable impact on the shape of the infrared sed @xcite .",
    "thus agn unification can be tested by comparing the seds of type 1 and 2 seyferts with model predictions .",
    "a third possibility is that the seyfert types are connected by evolution : an active nucleus evolves through a starburst ( type 2 ) phase during which it is heavily obscured , and into an agn phase ( type 1 ) when the obscuring dust has been evacuated from the nucleus by starburst - driven winds and agn outflows @xcite .",
    "supporting this picture is evidence that seyfert have significantly more star formation than seyfert .",
    "photometric studies have found that  have fainter nuclear infrared emission than and seds consistent with starburst - dominated ir emission , while  have seds consistent with pure agn + quiescent galaxy emission @xcite .",
    "however , as orientation is also likely to play a role in the differences between seyfert 1s and 2s , it is important to investigate the relative contributions of star formation and the active nucleus to the infrared emission in order to test both agn unification and evolutionary schemes .",
    "the spitzer space telescope represents a significant step forward in both sensitivity and spatial resolution compared with previous thermal infrared missions .",
    "we are conducting a large observing program with the spitzer space telescope to determine the mid - to - far infrared ( mfir ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of 87 seyfert galaxies ( pi : j. gallimore , pid : 3269 ) .",

    "an atlas of spectra and detailed modeling of individual spectra will be presented in a future paper when all data are available .",

    "the sample of seyfert galaxies used for this study comprises all seyfert galaxies from the extended 12  sample of @xcite that have @xmath5  .",
    "the potential advantage of the 12  sample is its perceived resistance to wavelength - dependent selection effects @xcite .",
    "the redshift criterion was included to ensure that the smallest possible physical size was probed by the fixed spitzer apertures in order to better exclude host galaxy emission .",
    "the resulting sample contains 87 sources .",
    "three of the sample galaxies , ngc1097 , ngc1566 , and ngc5033 , are being extensively observed as part of the sings legacy project , so we are obtaining data for 84 galaxies .",

    ", high frequency observations isolate the nuclear radio emission ( @xmath4 3.5  in extent ) associated with the agn from radio emission associated with star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "seyfert nuclei are relatively weak radio emitters , so the larger scale radio emission associated with star formation can dominate over the nuclear radio emission at lower spatial resolutions .",

    "limits are shown for 4 objects not detected by @xcite .",
    "radio flux densities for 6 objects not observed by @xcite were obtained from ned .",
    "these were generally lower resolution and lower frequency , and so upper limits to the flux density at 8.4  ghz were derived assuming @xmath8 .",

    "the raw data were processed by the spitzer pipeline version 11.0 .",
    "the nuclear spectra were extracted from the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) using smart @xcite .",
    "preliminary spectral maps show that the surface brightness is dominated by a central point source at these wavelengths , so the default point source aperture was used for the extractions .",
    "only three of the sources ( ngc  1365 , ngc  5005 , & ngc  5953 ) show a noticeable drop in flux between the overlapping ll ( long - low ) and sl ( short - low ) module spectra , which results from extended flux contributing to the wider ll module slit ( sl : 3.5 , ll : 10.5 ) .",
    "this supports our conclusion that the objects are dominated by the central point source , and so default point source extractions are appropriate .",
    "flux densities were calibrated based on flux calibration tables provided by the spitzer science center .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure [ fig : allspec ] , grouped according to their shape ( see  [ sec : res_spe ] ) .",
    "the full spectral maps will be presented in a future paper .    following a suggestion from the referee , comparison of the flux densities of the nuclear irs spectra with irac 5.8 and 8.0  nuclear photometry ( gallimore et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) later revealed that the spectra underestimated the source flux densities .",
    "we attribute this to slit losses that vary as a function of wavelength due to the increasing size of the point spread function with increasing wavelength .",
    "as these spectra were obtained in mapping mode , no attempt was made to center the nuclear point source in the slit during the observations .",
    "thus the nuclear ( central ) slit position is not necessarily well centered on the source and the spectra suffer wavelength - dependent slit losses , up to 20% .",
    "this is only a problem for strongly point - source dominated sources .",
    "we have attempted to account for this by producing a spectral image cube from the basic calibrated data fits files of all the slit positions ( after background subtraction using the off orders ) and iteratively determining an interpolated nuclear image based on the fractional shift perpendicular to the slit that produced the most total flux in the interpolated image .",
    "a simplex maximization technique was used to find the optimum interpolated position , which defined the plane containing the spectral image of the point source .",
    "we refer to the spectra extracted from the spectral image of the point source as `` pointing - corrected '' nuclear spectra .",
    "flux densities derived from the resulting pointing - corrected spectra agree well with our irac photometry , within 20% for the vast majority of objects and 30 - 45% for a few objects .",
    "the irs - derived flux densities both overestimate and underestimate the irac 5.8 and 8.0  point source flux densities , indicating that the flux calibration of our irs spectra is not systematically underestimating the true flux densities . excluding the comparison with iras (  [ sec : iras ] ) , in the remainder of the paper the analysis was performed on the original ( not pointing - corrected ) spectra . despite the fact that the flux errors are wavelength - dependent , we find that the overall shapes of the spectra are not changed significantly by the pointing correction .",
    "we do not expect that the flux errors will have a significant impact on the results .",

    "the majority of the iras flux is seen by irs , indicating the surface brightness distributions of the objects are compact .",

    "@xcite compared 5  aperture 10  flux densities of seyfert galaxies with the iras measurements and showed that the seyferts displayed a range of ground / iras flux densities from 0.0  1.0 , indicating that the sources ranged from highly compact objects dominated by the nuclear point source , to those with relatively strong extended emission , associated with star - formation .",
    "@xcite also compared small aperture ( 1.5 ) ground - based photometry of seyfert galaxies with iras measurements .",
    "their results show a similar distribution of flux deficits to our dataset , and these authors note that their data are relatively insensitive to diffuse extended emission due to the high spatial resolution of the detector , and to the small chopping distance used in the observations , which likely resulted in over - subtraction of background emission .",

    "the lack of a jump in flux density between the spectra obtained with the sl and ll modules , which have different slit widths , suggests that the emission occurs on scales larger than the ll module slit width ( @xmath210 ) .",

    "the relative contribution of the first eigenvector to each spectrum appears to be related to the 12  flux deficit ( figure [ fig : evonemiss ] ) , supporting the conclusion that it predominantly indicates the starburst component of the sed .",
    "this figure further suggests that objects with more _ extended _ starburst activity also have more _ nuclear _ starburst activity . figure [ fig : evonehist ] shows that the relative contribution of eigenvector 1 to each spectrum relates strongly to the shape of the sed , as the different shapes have significantly different contributions from this eigenvector ( probabilities @xmath40.03% that the distributions are from the same parent distribution , see table [ tab : statsb ] ) .",
    "negative relative contributions indicate that this component is subtracted from the ` mean ' spectrum to produce the observed spectrum .",
    "negative eigenvector 1 components in broken and unbroken power - law spectra may incorporate 10  silicate dust emission . the spectra with red continuum and pah emission features show the largest eigenvector 1 components , consistent with these objects having the greatest starburst contribution .",

    "we now consider the implications of our results for our understanding of the starburst / agn connection , the agn unified model , and selection effects in agn samples .",

    "we find no difference in the redshifts of these objects compared with the other ir spectral types , indicating that the relative strength of the starburst component is not an aperture effect .",
    "we do find evidence , however , that the strength of the nuclear starburst , as measured by the contribution of the first eigenvector in the pca , is related to the extended star formation , measured by the 12  flux deficit ( figure [ fig : evonemiss ] ) . in the starburst - dominated objects the dust is cool and",
    "so peaks longward of 30  , and the pah features are strong . in contrast , objects with broken and unbroken power - law spectra are probably dominated by the agn contribution to the spectrum .",
    "previous studies suggest that this agn contribution is a warm dust component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the power - law spectra are produced by dust with a range of temperatures @xcite , and the apparent break in the broken power - law spectra is produced by a dominant dust component peaking at @xmath220  .",
    "mfir photometric seds of several seyferts , based on _ iso _ data , are consistent with such a dust component @xcite . that the mid - ir emission is dominated by dust is also supported by the recent identification of silicate dust emission features in agn mid - ir spectra @xcite . in order to understand the spectral shapes , we have begun comprehensive modeling using both agn and starburst dust radiative transfer models ,",
    "the results of which will be reported elsewhere ( buchanan et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the sharpness of the break in some irs spectra near 20  ( e.g. , ngc  4151 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : egspec ] ) is difficult to reproduce using simple dust models , however , even with several dust components .",
    "the ir emission is clearly produced by dust emission in the two objects with strong silicate absorption at 10  .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the infrared emission may be non - thermal in origin , such as synchrotron emission . the broad - band photometric seds of nearby seyfert galaxies provide evidence that the mid - ir emission of many  is predominantly non - thermal @xcite , although a non - thermal ir component is not always necessary to model agn seds @xcite .",
    "the detection of rapid variability at 10  in some nearby quasars indicates a non - thermal component of the mid - ir emission @xcite , and further supports that the  may also have a non - thermal ir contribution .",
    "comparison of the ir and nuclear 8.4  ghz radio flux densities suggests that the infrared emission is not a continuation of the radio synchrotron spectrum , as the ir fluxes are at least an order of magnitude too high .",
    "if the synchrotron were self - absorbed and the spectral turnover occurred at 20  , consistent with the observed break in the power - law spectra , the component would have to be @xmath33  m in size , on the same scale as the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the typical spectral slope at frequencies below ( i.e. , wavelengths above 20  ) the turnover would have to be 0.8 to match the radio flux densities .",
    "this slope , and the typical slopes at frequencies above the turnover ( wavelengths below 20  ) of @xmath2 - 1.3 , are not inconsistent with self - absorbed synchrotron emission , so we can not rule this out as the origin of the power - law spectra .",
    "however , the energy density of such a synchrotron component would be very large ( @xmath29@xmath3410@xmath35  erg@xmath36 ) , so extreme conditions would be required to confine it .",
    "the total energy in the plasma would also be large , ( @xmath210@xmath37  ergs ) , suggesting that such a component is unlikely .",
    "a third alternative for the broken and unbroken power - law spectra is free - free bremsstrahlung , however this would produce a much flatter slope ( @xmath38 ) @xcite than is observed in the spectra .",
    "a final possibility is that the ir emission is a continuation of the accretion disk spectrum , with a slope of , for example , 1/3 ( eq . 5.46 , p.92 ; @xcite ) , though more realistic accretion models will modify this ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this will be investigated in the future using x - ray ",
    "optical data in conjunction with the ir data .",
    "the results of our principal component analysis show that the first eigenvector produces more than 90% of the variance in the observed spectral shapes and is dominated by a starburst spectral shape .",
    "this suggests that the relative contribution of star - formation to the ir spectrum is an important factor determining the observed spectral shape .",
    "however , we emphasize that , while the starburst contribution dominates the observed differences in the ir spectral shapes , the starburst component does not dominate the total emission of each object .",
    "most spectra are comprised of a power law plus a @xmath420% contribution of eigenvector 1 ( figure [ fig : evonesy ] ) .",
    "we found a significant difference between the contribution of the first eigenvector to the spectra of the  and .",
    "this is consistent with the ( on average ) higher flux deficits at 12 and 25  in  compared with , suggesting that extended flux ( i.e. , associated with circumnuclear star formation ) contributes more to the total mid - ir flux in  than .",
    "our results confirm the finding of @xcite , based on ground - based photometry , that  show more extended star formation than .",
    "the sample of objects studied by @xcite were optically selected , and therefore our result is not due to an infrared selection bias . we have concluded that the extended emission is associated with star formation , however it has also been shown that extended ir emission , on scales of tens of parsecs , can also be associated with the agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our data demonstrates a clear relationship between the seyfert type and the ir sed shape ( i.e. ,  tend to have power - law or broken power - law seds and  have greater starburst contribution to their seds ) , but there is not a 1-to-1 correspondence between the optical seyfert type and the ir spectral shape .",
    "it is clear that star formation and complex dust obscuration play key roles in producing the observed variety of spectral shapes in the irs spectra .",
    "homogeneous optical spectra , to ensure uniform seyfert classifications , and simultaneous modeling of the optical and ir seds are necessary to elucidate these relations .      comparing the optical spectral types of the ir spectral groups (  [ sec : res_spe ] ) , it is not immediately apparent whether or not the ir spectra support orientation - dependent obscuration .",
    "torus models predict silicate emission in type 1 ( face - on ) objects and silicate absorption features in type 2 ( edge - on ) objects ( @xcite , though see also @xcite ) .",
    "we would expect edge - on objects to show the most dust absorption .",
    "the two objects that show strong silicate absorption have optical spectral types sy  1.9 and hblr , which is not inconsistent with the unified scheme . the majority of broken power - law spectra that may show silicate emission features are sy  1.2 and sy  1.5 , although the group includes several  as well . the relative contribution of a starburst to the ir spectrum appears to be greater in , possibly due to a selection effect ( see  [ subsec : dis_sel ] ) , so that it is difficult to discern any orientation - dependent difference in the agn component of the spectra .",
    "the ratio of ir to radio flux densities is consistently higher for the type 1 objects in our sample than the type 2 objects , at all observed wavelengths .",
    "interpreting this in the context of the unified scheme , this may indicate that the obscuring material is optically thick up to at least 30  .",
    "optically thick smooth - density torus models predict much larger differences between the face - on and edge - on seyferts than the observed factor of @xmath22 , seen in our data at wavelengths longer than @xmath215  ( figure [ fig : irradio ] ) . for example",
    ", @xcite show that , for an optically thick torus , the face - on objects are expected to be at least a factor of 5 and up to several orders of magnitude brighter than the edge - on objects .",
    "@xcite first noted that torus models can not explain the observed lack of anisotropy in the ir emission of seyferts , when they compared the 6  emission of  and , normalized to the intrinsic hard x - ray emission .",
    "our findings , while not identical to those of @xcite at 6  ( discussed below ) , confirm that observational data do not match the predictions of optically thick smooth - density torus models .",
    "our results are consistent with the torus becoming optically _ thin _ in the mid - ir , at around 15  .",
    "however , a mid - ir optical depth @xmath41 would imply column density @xmath39  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is inconsistent with x - ray observations of many seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed high x - ray column densities of  could be reconciled with optically thin ir emission , if the x - ray absorption is dominated by gas in which the dust has been destroyed , e.g. , close to the nucleus within the dust sublimation radius .",
    "there is some evidence that this may be possible : variability in the x - ray column densities of two seyfert  on timescales of less than a day indicates that absorbing columns of up to @xmath40 10@xmath41  exist on scales of less than a few hundred schwarzchild radii @xcite .",
    "thus our ir / radio flux density ratios could indicate that the torus is optically thin above 15  . as noted in ",
    "[ subsec : res_rats ] the difference in the ratio of ir / radio flux densities between  and  is particularly apparent around 10  ; the 10  flux density from an optically thin torus is predicted to show more anisotropy than the surrounding continuum @xcite , suggesting that our results are also consistent with an optically thin torus at shorter mid - ir wavelengths than 15  .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the 6.2  pah feature associated with star formation is contributing to the apparent peak at 10  in figure [ fig : irradio]_(b)_. certainly , the steep rise in this figure towards the shortest wavelengths ( from 7 down to 5  ) suggests that the obscuring material is optically thick at these wavelengths .",
    "clumpy torus models can accommodate much less anisotropy of the mid - ir emission than models with smooth radial density distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the torus emitting near - isotropically in the mid - ir , but with anisotropic x - ray absorption , can be explained by clumpy torus models , if the radial distribution of optically thick dust clumps is steep ( nenkova et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the similar ratios of ir / radio flux density of  and  observed in our sample therefore may be explained by an optically thick clumpy torus .",
    "our ir / radio ratios at 6  appear to be in disagreement with those of @xcite , who found no significant difference between  and  in their ratio of x - ray / ir flux densities .",
    "these authors used the intrinsic ( i.e. , absorption - corrected ) x - ray flux densities as a measure of the agn luminosity , and determined the ratio of the x - ray flux density to the 6  agn continuum flux density , derived from iso spectra .",
    "@xcite find the average x - ray / ir flux ratio of  in their sample to be a factor of @xmath22 _ less _ than the average ratio for type 2 seyferts , which is contrary to the expectations of torus models in the unified scheme .",
    "our results show a factor of @xmath27 difference at this wavelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irradio ] ) , in the opposite direction .",
    "there are several factors which are likely to contribute to the disagreement between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "firstly , the relative agn and starburst contributions to the ir flux densities are likely to be different in the two studies .",
    "the iso data of @xcite were obtained using a 24aperture , which will include a large contribution of extended emission ; the authors account for this using spectral decomposition to determine the agn continuum .",
    "in contrast our data are relatively small aperture and so better isolate the nuclear emission , but we have not attempted to remove the starburst contribution to the ir emission , which is clearly different for the type  and  in our sample . secondly , the sample studied by @xcite was heterogeneous and includes , for example ,  and  with different distance and intrinsic luminosity distributions .",
    "the redshift and intrinsic ( radio ) luminosity distributions of the type  and  in our homogeneous sample are similar ( see  [ sec : sample ] ) and so will not have biased the comparison of the mid - ir emission .",
    "finally , the studies are using measurements at different wavelengths to represent the intrinsic agn luminosities .",
    "large corrections ( up to an order of magnitude ) are required to determine the intrinsic x - ray flux densities from the observed flux densities , and therefore there may be considerable uncertainty in the obtained intrinsic agn luminosities , although we note that @xcite find no evidence for a systematic offset in the absorption - corrected values which would bias their result .",
    "given the various systematic biases in each of the studies , it is perhaps not surprising that the exact ratios of // ir emission measured are not the same . however , despite this disagreement , our results at the longer wavelengths lead us to the same conclusion as @xcite : the data are not consistent with optically thick , smooth - density torus models ( e.g , @xcite ) , which predict strongly anisotropic mid - ir emission .",
    "in the context of the unified scheme , the ir / radio flux density ratios of the  and  in our sample suggest that the torus may be optically thick at wavelengths shorter than @xmath215  ( see figure [ fig : irradio ] and  [ subsec : dis_torus ] ) .",
    "the seyfert sample was selected using iras fluxes at 12  , therefore we might expect there to be orientation - dependent selection effects biasing our sample , that is , that dust obscuration will bias the sample towards type . a second possible selection effect , if  have more star formation than , is discussed below .",
    "to fall above the flux limit of the sample , the must contain intrinsically brighter agns than the , because the  suffer more mir dust obscuration .",
    "however , we find no significant difference between the agn luminosities of the  and  in the sample ( as measured by the optically thin radio emission , see  [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "further , if the  have more luminous agn emission than the  due to a selection effect , we may expect that the contribution of the first eigenvector would be different for high and low radio power sources .",
    "again , we find no significant difference in the distributions of relative eigenvector 1 components for high ( @xmath42  ) and low power radio sources in the sample ( figure [ fig : radpowerhist ] ) .",
    "it is possible that small number statistics are preventing us from detecting a significant difference in the radio powers of the  and  ( see table [ tab : statsa ] ) .",
    "the lower ir / radio flux density ratios observed in  compared with  are consistent with more luminous radio sources in .    a second selection effect could be operating in the opposite direction to that associated with orientation - dependent obscuration of the nucleus . with intrinsically faint nuclei could make it into the sample if they have an additional starburst contribution to the 12  flux density .",
    "this would result in the sample being biased towards  with a greater relative and absolute starburst contribution than the  in the sample .",
    "it is clear from our color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cols ] ) and principal component analysis that the observed  show a stronger starburst contribution to their infrared spectra than the , consistent with such a bias .",
    "a near - infrared study has shown that the  in the 12  sample are not biased towards those with powerful nuclear starbursts compared with optically - selected  @xcite , but the 12  -selected  may be biased towards more luminous",
    "_ extended _ starbursts due to the large - aperture iras observations used to select them .    thus we can not exclude the possibility that the two selection effects described above are canceling each other out to give the same distribution of infrared luminosities for  and .",
    "however , it is puzzling that , if the sample is biased towards  with intrinsically brighter agn and/or those with greater starburst contribution to their ir emission , that we see no differences in the agn ( radio ) luminosities .",
    "the similar distribution of intrinsic agn luminosities ( radio powers ) may imply that the effects of obscuration and starburst contribution are small compared with the agn luminosities .",
    "alternatively , the statistical results may become clearer when more of our data are available .",
    "further leverage on selection effects and biases can be obtained using irac imaging data , which we will address in future work .",
    "the selection of seyfert samples based on the isotropic luminosity of the agn and which are unbiased with respect to orientation is essential to study the physics of active galaxies and the agn / starburst connection .",
    "an unbiased sample is difficult to obtain , however .",
    "the optical and 0.1  10  kev x - ray continuum fluxes suffer uncertain orientation dependent obscuration so favor  and discriminate against  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "optical line emission , such as , originates in the narrow line region so should be isotropic and representative of the intrinsic agn luminosity .",
    "however it has been shown recently @xcite that , while the numbers of  and  are comparable at low [ ] luminosity , seyfert  outnumber the  by a factor of about 3 at high [ ] luminosity , suggesting that [ ] luminosity may not be an unbiased criterion .",
    "it has further been argued , for powerful agn , that some [ ] emission may come from within the torus , and therefore be orientation - dependent @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that selection effects are minimal in the 7  12  @xmath43 region . the extended 12  sample of seyfert galaxies was thus selected to minimize wavelength - dependent selection effects .",
    "our results have shown , however , that the nuclear obscuring material may be optically thick at mir wavelengths up to 15  and so selection effects are still important in the mid - ir .",
    "the torus presumably becomes optically thin at far - ir wavelengths , but at these wavelengths it becomes difficult to separate nuclear emission from circumnuclear star formation , which emits strongly at fir wavelengths due to the presence of cold dust .",
    "similarly , at low radio frequencies and spatial resolutions , such as the first survey at 1.4  ghz @xcite , the relatively strong contribution of star formation to the nuclear spectrum may bias the selection . to obtain a sample of seyfert galaxies unbiased by possible orientation effects , it is therefore necessary to select galaxies based on optically thin , compact radio emission associated with the active nucleus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a large area ( 10 square degrees ) , sensitive ( 0.2 mjy / beam ) survey at high spatial resolution ( 0.2 ) at high frequency ( 8  ghz ) would seem to be a useful way to select nearby  and unbiased by orientation effects .",
    "we present the results of spitzer irs nuclear spectra for the first 51 of a complete sample of 12  selected seyfert galaxies .",
    "we find the following main conclusions : + @xmath18 the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes and spectral features .",
    "the largest group ( 47% of the sample of 51 ) shows very red continuum suggestive of cool dust and strong emission features attributed to pahs .",
    "sixteen objects ( 31% ) have a power - law continuum with spectral indices @xmath0 - 2.3  -0.9 that flatten to @xmath1 - 1.1  0.0 at @xmath220  .",
    "clear silicate emission features at 10 and 18  are found in two of these objects ( mrk  6 and mrk  335 ) . a further 16% of the sample show power - law continua with unchanging slopes of @xmath3 - 1.7  -1.1 .",
    "two objects are dominated by a broad silicate absorption feature .",
    "one object in the sample shows an unusual spectrum dominated by emission features , that is unlike any of the other spectra .",
    "some features are clearly related to the starburst contribution to the ir spectrum , while the mechanisms producing the power - law continuum attributed to the agn component are not yet clear .",
    "the precise correspondence between the ir types and the optical spectral types is unclear , firstly because the exact contributions of the agn and starburst to the ir emission are not clearly separated by colors or principal component analysis , and secondly because the seyfert types are heterogeneous and often ambiguous .",
    "+ @xmath18 principal component analysis suggests that the relative contribution of starburst - heated dust emission to the sed is the dominant cause of variance in the observed spectra , although all the spectra are dominated by a power - law component .",
    "the close detailed agreement of eigenvector 1 with the spectrum of a starburst at @xmath4420  makes it almost certain that eigenvector 1 is tracking the starburst component in these agns .",
    "moreover , that eigenvector 1 is linked to 12  iras / spitzer flux deficit , shows that this star formation is extended and so not a purely nuclear phenomenon .",
    "+ @xmath18 we find that the  typically show stronger starburst contributions in their ir spectra than the , confirming previous results found using photometric data .",
    "this result is in disagreement with the predictions of unified schemes .",
    "the stronger starburst contribution in  compared with  may be a selection effect in our sample , though we find no evidence supporting the presence of a bias in our sample .",

    "the observed factor of @xmath22 difference between the type  and  in their ir / radio ratios above 15  requires the standard smooth - density torus models to be optically thin at these wavelengths .",
    "however , the resulting low torus opacity requires that the high observed columns detected in x - ray absorption be produced in gas with very low dust to gas ratio ( perhaps within the dust sublimation region ) . on the other hand",

    "<S> we are conducting a large observing program with the spitzer space telescope to determine the mid - to - far infrared spectral energy distributions of a well - defined sample of 87 nearby , 12  -selected seyfert galaxies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of irs low - resolution spectroscopy of a statistically representative subsample of 51 of the galaxies ( 59% ) , with an analysis of the continuum shapes and a comparison of the seyfert types . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes and spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> the largest group ( 47% of the sample of 51 ) shows very red continuum suggestive of cool dust and strong emission features attributed to pahs . </S>",
    "<S> sixteen objects ( 31% ) have a power - law continuum with spectral indices @xmath0 - 2.3  -0.9 that flatten to @xmath1 - 1.1  0.0 at @xmath220  . </S>",
    "<S> clear silicate emission features at 10 and 18  are found in two of these objects ( mrk  6 and mrk  335 ) . a further 16% of the sample show power - law continua with unchanging slopes of @xmath3 - 1.7  -1.1 . </S>",
    "<S> two objects are dominated by a broad silicate absorption feature . </S>",
    "<S> one object in the sample shows an unusual spectrum dominated by emission features , that is unlike any of the other spectra . </S>",
    "<S> some spectral features are clearly related to a starburst contribution to the ir spectrum , while the mechanisms producing observed power - law continuum shapes , attributed to an agn component , may be dust or non - thermal emission . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared spectral types appear to be related to the seyfert types . </S>",
    "<S> principal component analysis results suggest that the relative contribution of starburst emission may be the dominant cause of variance in the observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the derived starburst component of each spectrum , however , contributes @xmath440% of the total flux density . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the ir emission with the optically thin radio emission associated with the agn and find that  have higher ratios of ir / radio emission than , as predicted by the unified model if the torus is optically thick in the mid - ir . </S>",
    "<S> however , smooth - density torus models predict a much larger difference between type  and  than the factor of 2 difference observed in our sample ; the observed factor of @xmath22 difference between the type  and  in their ir / radio ratios above 15  requires the standard smooth - density torus models to be optically thin at these wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting low torus opacity requires that the high observed columns detected in x - ray absorption be produced in gas with very low dust to gas ratio ( perhaps within the dust sublimation region ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , our observations may be consistent with clumpy torus models containing a steep radial distribution of optically thick dense clumps . </S>",
    "<S> the selection of our sample at 12  , where the torus may be optically thick , implies that there may be orientation - dependent biases in the sample , however we do not find that the sample is biased towards  with more luminous central engines as would be expected . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the  typically show stronger starburst contributions than the  in the sample , contrary to what is expected based on the unified scheme for agn . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to the selection effect that only those seyfert  with strong starburst contributions had high enough integrated 12  flux densities to fall above the flux limit of the sample . </S>"
