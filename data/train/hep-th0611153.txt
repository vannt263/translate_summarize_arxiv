    "although hopf algebraic concepts were used in quantum field theory ( qft ) as early as 1969 @xcite , the real boom in the collaboration between hopf algebra and qft started with the work of connes and kreimer in 1998 @xcite , that spurred an enthusiastic activity partly reviewed by figueroa and gracia - bondia @xcite . in these works",
    ", hopf algebraic structures were discovered in qft and used to reinterpret some aspects of renormalization theory .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a bit different . as a first purpose",
    ", it tries to convince the reader that hopf algebra is a natural language for qft . for that purpose , it uses hopf algebraic techniques to express important concepts of qft : chronological products , s - matrix , feynman diagrams , connected diagrams , green functions , renormalization .",
    "the power of hopf algebra manifests itself through the ease and economy with which complete proofs can be given , with full combinatorial factors .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that qft concepts can help designing new hopf algebraic objects . as a first example , the connected feynman diagrams lead us to the definition of two coproducts on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is a coalgebra , @xmath2 the symmetric algebra over @xmath4 and @xmath3 the tensor algebra over @xmath4 ) .",
    "these two coproducts are in a comodule coalgebra relation and enable us to define `` connected '' coregular actions on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as a second example , the bogoliubov approach to renormalization leads to a group structure on the linear maps from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and from @xmath5 to @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is a vector space .",
    "there , the infinitesimal bialgebraic structure of @xmath5 plays an essential role @xcite . as a last example we recall that renormalization can be considered as a functor on bialgebras  @xcite .",
    "it might be useful to explain why hopf algebra is so powerful to deal with quantum field theory . the first reason was given long ago by joni and rota  @xcite : the coproduct splits an object into subobjects and the product merges two objects into a new one .",
    "these operations are fundamental in most combinatorial problems .",
    "therefore , hopf algebra is a convenient framework to deal with combinatorics in general and with the combinatorial problems of qft in particular .",
    "the second reason has to do with the fact that hopf algebraic techniques efficiently exploit the recursive nature of perturbative qft .",
    "if we express this property in terms of feynman diagrams , hopf algebra makes it very easy to add a new vertex to a diagram and to deduce properties of diagrams with @xmath6 vertices from properties of diagrams with @xmath7 vertices .",
    "such recursive procedure can also be carried out directly on feynman diagrams , without using hopf algebra , but it is much harder and is the source `` egregious errors by distinguished savants '' , as wightman put it @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "many textbooks give detailed proofs for very simple diagrams and leave as an exercise to the reader the proof of the general case .",
    "no such thing happens with hopf algebras : the present paper makes clear that a proof for one million vertices is as simple as for two vertices . finally , the hopf algebraic approach uses naturally the fact that the unrenormalized chronological product is an associative product .",
    "this property is usually overlooked .",
    "the use of hopf algebraic techniques reveals also that many quantum field concepts can be defined on any cocommutative coalgebra .",
    "sometimes , natural noncommutative analogues of the commutative constructions of quantum field theory can be found .",
    "the hopf algebra background of this paper can be learnt from the first chapters of any book on the subject , but majid s monograph @xcite is particularly well suited .",
    "this section provides a self - contained introduction to qft using hopf algebraic tools .",
    "some aspects of this section were already published in a conference proceedings @xcite , but complete proofs are given here for the first time .",
    "we deliberately avoid the delicate analytical problems of quantum field theory .    for some well - known physicists @xcite ,",
    "feynman diagrams are the essence of qft .",
    "indeed , feynman diagrams contain a complete description of perturbative qft , which provides its most spectacular success : the calculation of the gyromagnetic factor of the electron @xcite .",
    "therefore , this primer goes all the way to the derivation of feynman diagrams .",
    "however , it is not restricted to a particular quantum field theory but is valid for any cocommutative coalgebra @xmath4 over @xmath8 . by extending the coproduct and counit of @xmath4 to the symmetric algebra @xmath2",
    ", we equip @xmath2 with the structure of a commutative and cocommutative bialgebra .",
    "then , we twist the product of @xmath2 using a laplace pairing ( or coquasitriangular structure ) to define the chronological product @xmath9 . this chronological product enables us to describe the s - matrix of the theory , that contains all the measurable quantities .",
    "the s - matrix is then expanded over feynman diagrams and the green functions are defined .      in the qft of the scalar field , the counital coalgebra @xmath4 is generated as a vector space over @xmath8 by the symbols @xmath10 where @xmath6 runs over the nonnegative integers and @xmath11 runs over a finite number of points in @xmath12 .",
    "the choice of a finite number of points is meant to avoid analytical problems and is consistent with the framework of perturbative qft .",
    "the coproduct @xmath13 of @xmath4 is @xmath14 the counit @xmath15 of @xmath4 is @xmath16 .",
    "the coalgebra @xmath4 is cocommutative ( it is a direct sum of binomial coalgebras ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 is a pointed coalgebra because all its simple subcoalgebras are one - dimensional ( each simple subcoalgebra is generated by a @xmath17 ) .",
    "this coalgebra is chosen for comparison with qft , but the following construction is valid for any cocommutative coalgebra . from the coalgebra @xmath4",
    "we now build a commutative and cocommutative bialgebra @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetric algebra @xmath18 can be equipped with the structure of a bialgebra over @xmath8 .",
    "the product of the bialgebra @xmath2 is the symmetric product ( denoted by juxtaposition ) and its coproduct @xmath19 is defined on @xmath20 by @xmath21 and extended to @xmath2 by algebra morphism : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the elements of @xmath24 are said to be of degree @xmath6 .",
    "the counit @xmath25 of @xmath2 is defined to be equal to @xmath15 on @xmath20 and extended to @xmath2 by algebra morphism : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it can be checked that @xmath19 is coassociative and cocommutative @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is a commutative and cocommutative bialgebra which is graded as an algebra . in the case of the coalgebra of the scalar field",
    ", we have @xmath28 the powers @xmath29 of the coproduct are called _ iterated coproducts _ and are defined by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "their action on an element @xmath33 of @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath34 . in the case of the scalar field",
    ", we have    [ itercop ] if @xmath35 is a positive integer , the @xmath35-th iterated coproduct of @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 runs over all @xmath35-tuples of nonnegative integers @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .    for @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the left hand side of the equality is @xmath36 . on the other hand",
    ", we have only one integer @xmath43 that must be equal to @xmath6 because of the constraint @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the right hand side is also @xmath36 and the lemma is true for @xmath41 .",
    "assume that the lemma is true up to @xmath44 .",
    "from the definition of @xmath29 and the recursion hypothesis , we have @xmath45 if we define the tuple @xmath46 with @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then we see that that @xmath51 runs over all tuples of @xmath52 nonnegative integers such that @xmath53 and we can rewrite @xmath54 and the lemma is proved for @xmath29 .    now , we equip @xmath2 with a laplace pairing that will be used to twist the commutative product of @xmath2 .      the concept of laplace pairing was introduced by rota and collaborators @xcite . in the quantum group literature , it is called a coquasitriangular structure @xcite .",
    "a laplace pairing is a linear map @xmath55 from @xmath56 to the complex numbers such that @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for any @xmath33 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in @xmath2 .",
    "the laplace pairing of products of elements of @xmath2 is calculated with the following lemma    [ u1uk ] for @xmath62 and @xmath63 in @xmath2 , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the term in position @xmath66 of the iterated coproduct @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the term in position @xmath69 of the iterated coproduct @xmath70 .    for example @xmath71 .",
    "the proof is recursive . if @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so that lemma [ u1uk ] becomes @xmath75 , which is true .",

    "lemma [ u1uk ] becomes @xmath80 by algebra morphism @xmath81 and by the definition of the laplace pairing and by the coassociativity of the coproduct @xmath82 .",
    "if we introduce this equation in ( [ u1ukproof ] ) and redefine @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we obtain lemma [ u1uk ] for @xmath52 and @xmath76 .",
    "if we apply the same reasoning to @xmath85 , we see that the lemma is true for @xmath35 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , it is true for all @xmath35 and @xmath76 .    if we write lemma [ u1uk ] with all @xmath62 and @xmath63 in @xmath4 , we see that the laplace pairing is entirely determined by its value on @xmath4 . in other words",
    ", once we know @xmath87 for all @xmath88 and @xmath89 in @xmath4 , lemma [ u1uk ] enables us to calculate the laplace pairing on @xmath2 . in the case of the algebra of the scalar field",

    "the solution of this problem is the first step of the renormalization theory . in the following , we assume that @xmath110 was regularized to make it a smooth function , so that @xmath111 is well defined .",
    "the laplace pairing induces a twisted product @xmath9 on @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath60 are elements of @xmath2 , the twisted product of @xmath33 and @xmath60 is denoted by @xmath112 and defined by @xmath113 .",
    "this product was introduced by sweedler @xcite as a crossed product in hopf algebra cohomology theory because a laplace pairing is a 2-cocycle .",
    "it was defined independently by rota and stein as a _ circle product _ @xcite . to become familiar with this twisted product ,",

    "the second lemma is    [ ( u|vow ) ] for @xmath33 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in @xmath2 , @xmath119    from the definitions of the twisted product and of the laplace pairing we find @xmath120 where we used the cocommutativity of the coproduct of @xmath33 and @xmath61 .",
    "the definition of the laplace pairing gives now @xmath121    these two lemmas enable us to prove the associativity of the twisted product as follows @xmath122 by lemma [ deltauov ] .",
    "lemma [ ( u|vow ) ] is used to transform @xmath123 into @xmath124 , so that @xmath125 where we used again lemma [ deltauov ] and the definition of the twisted product .",
    "finally , the fact that 1 is the unit of the twisted product follows from the condition @xmath126 by @xmath127      in quantum field theory , we start from an element @xmath88 of @xmath4 , called the lagrangian , and the s - matrix is defined ( in the sense of formal power series in the complex number @xmath128 ) as @xmath129 to compare this expression with that given in qft textbooks @xcite , take @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate iterated twisted products .",
    "we shall see that feynman diagrams arise from these iterated products .",

    "thus , it is important to investigate how connected chronological products are renormalized .",
    "the relation between the connected renormalized chronological product @xmath577 and the connected chronological product @xmath378 is , for @xmath375 , @xmath578    we first note that we can use definition [ deflambdan ] to rewrite equation under the form @xmath579 .",

    "such an expression for the renormalization of the connected chronological product was used , for instance , by hollands @xcite .      in qft",
    ", the linear maps @xmath445 have a very particular form .",
    "in the example of the @xmath593 theory , the lagrangian is @xmath310 and @xmath594 where @xmath595 , @xmath596 and @xmath596 are real numbers related to the charge , wavefunction and mass renormalization @xcite .",
    "such a lagrangian can not be manipulated directly with our approach because the integral over @xmath12 involves an infinite number of points . however , as explained in section [ chronsect ] , it can be given a meaning in the perturbative approach .",

    "this poses several problems that are debated by stora , boas , dtsch and fredenhagen @xcite , concerning the status of the action ward identity or whether the fields should be taken on - shell or off - shell .",
    "before the situation is fully clarified , we can propose a model without derivatives ( i.e. where the divergences are only logarithmic , in the qft parlance @xcite ) .",
    "in that case , it was shown in a paper with bill schmitt @xcite , that the coalgebra @xmath4 has to be replaced by a bialgebra @xmath598 and that renormalization becomes a functor on bialgebras . in the case of the scalar field , the product is defined by @xmath599 .",
    "it can be checked that , with this product , the coalgebra of the scalar field becomes indeed a commutative bialgebra @xmath598 .",
    "this simplified model can be extended to any commutative and cocommutative bialgebra @xmath598 by defining the maps @xmath445 as @xmath600 , where @xmath128 is a linear map from @xmath601 to @xmath8 and @xmath602 is defined as follows : if @xmath603 , then @xmath604 , if @xmath605 , then @xmath606 where the product @xmath95 is in @xmath598 . with this definition , it is clear that @xmath445 is a linear map from @xmath607 to @xmath598 .",
    "the fact that such @xmath445 form a subgroup of the renormalization group defined in the previous paragraph follows from the existence of a bialgebraic structure on @xmath608 , studied in detail in @xcite .",

    "we give a detailed proof because unital infinitesimal algebra are not as well studied as hopf algebras .",
    "we first show recursively the identity @xmath630 for @xmath631 , equation is satisfied because @xmath632 equation is obviously true for @xmath358 and all @xmath410 .",
    "thus , we take from now on @xmath633 .",
    "assume that equation is true up to @xmath6 , then the definition of @xmath634 , the relation @xmath635 , and the recursion hypothesis imply @xmath636 the lemma follows by summing both sides of equation over @xmath6 .",

    "in particular , the subset of @xmath617 characterized by @xmath647 for @xmath498 is a group .",
    "the proof is the same as for the commutative case .",
    "this paper described the first steps of a complete description of qft in hopf algebraic terms .",
    "although these steps look encouraging , many open problems still have to be solved .",
    "the main one is analytical : the use of a finite number of points is not really satisfactory and we should allow for coalgebras containing elements such as @xmath648 for some test functions @xmath467 .",
    "other open problems are easier .",
    "we list now three of them : ( i ) the renormalization approach presented here is equivalent to the connes - kreimer approach because both are equivalent to the standard bphz renormalization @xcite",
    ". however , it would be quite interesting to describe this equivalence explicitly .",
    "( ii ) we proved that a qft is renormalized once its connected chronological product is renormalized .",
    "in fact , a deeper result is true : a qft is renormalized once its one - particle irreducible diagrams are renormalized @xcite . to cast this result into our framework",
    ", we would need to write the connected chronological product @xmath378 in terms of a one - particle irreducible chronological product .",
    "although such a connection was announced by epstein and glaser @xcite , it was described as complicated and was apparently never published .",
    "three possible solutions to this problem have been explored  @xcite similarly , it would be worthwhile to determine a hopf algebraic expression of green functions in terms of @xmath6-particle irreducible functions , which is usually done by legendre transformation techniques @xcite .",
    "( iii ) it would be important to develop the analogue of the constructions presented in this paper to the case of gauge theories .",
    "along that line , van suijlekom obtained the remarkable result that the ward and slavnov - taylor identities generate a hopf ideal of the hopf algebra of renormalization @xcite",
    ". it would be nice to see how this result can be adapted to our framework .",
    "the most original aspect of this work is the determination of noncommutative analogues of some qft concepts ( i.e. the replacement of @xmath2 by @xmath3 , or of @xmath0 by @xmath5 ) .",
    "such a noncommutative analogue was first determined for quantum electrodynamics @xcite and it lead to the definition of a noncommutative fa di bruno algebra @xcite , generalized to many variables by anshelevich et al .",
    "these algebras provide an effective way to manipulate series in noncommutative variables .",
    "the noncommutative constructions defined in the present paper can also be useful for that purpose .",
    "the present approach enables us to recover the feynman diagram formulation of qft , but its most interesting aspect is that it is defined at the operator level .",
    "for example , in our notation , the relation between connected and standard chronological product is given not only at the level of the coregular actions @xmath79 and @xmath390 , but at the level of the maps from @xmath2 to @xmath2 ( i.e. the relation between @xmath288 and @xmath378 ) .",
    "as a consequence , we can calculate green functions such as @xmath649 where @xmath650 is a map from @xmath2 to @xmath8 .",
    "such more general green functions are the basic objects of the quantum field theory with initial correlations ( or qft of degenerate systems ) which is well suited to the calculation of highly - correlated systems @xcite .",
