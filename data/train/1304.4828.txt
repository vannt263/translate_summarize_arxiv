    "understanding of the mechanisms responsible for destruction of the superconducting state is one of the most fundamental problems in physics of superconductors .",
    "it is known now that at the critical current a superconducting sample generally does not simply enter the fully normal state .",
    "the building up of an intermediate state structure @xcite , flux flow @xcite , and heating effects @xcite lead to complicated transition behaviour @xcite .",
    "a number of very interesting phenomena have been observed for quasi - low - dimensional superconductors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the measurements of the current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) of such superconductors revealed a large transition region between the first occurrence of non - zero voltage and the completely normal state @xcite . within this transition region",
    "the voltage increases in a series of regular voltage jumps .",
    "the experimental and theoretical studies showed that every voltage jump is associated with the appearance of a localized phase - slip center ( psc ) @xcite in narrow superconducting channels or a phase - slip line ( psl ) @xcite in wide superconducting films .",
    "moreover , the electric properties of a superconductor between the superconducting and fully normal state is determined by a system of interacting pscs @xcite .",
    "their dynamics is still poorly understood , and at the moment is of a great research interest @xcite .",
    "previously it was found out that the parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the relaxation time of the amplitude of the order parameter ( op ) and @xmath12 is the relaxation time of the phase of the op , governs the dynamics of the pscs in a narrow superconducting ring @xcite . with this , the superconducting channel can demonstrate two dynamical regimes . if @xmath13 , then the phase of the op relaxes faster than the amplitude , and pscs occurs more or less simultaneously at different regions of the channel ( see fig .",
    "3b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of @xmath14",
    "the pscs appear consecutively at the same spot of the channel ( see fig .",
    "3a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the steps in the cvc can be associated with bifurcations of either steady or oscillatory dynamics of op .",
    "these bifurcations can substantially complicate dynamics of the op and eventually lead to appearance of such sophisticated phenomena as multistability and chaos @xcite .",
    "thus , the appearance of multiple pscs can be explained in terms of bifurcation phenomena .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite report that the period - doubling bifurcation can be involved in formation and evolution of multiple pscs in the spatio - temporal dynamics of op .",
    "another interesting property of narrow superconducting channels is that their cvcs are able to demonstrate quite wide hysteresis , which is found to arise from joule heating and the strong temperature dependence of the resistance of the wire @xcite .",
    "shunting of the channel by a resistor narrows this hysteresis , and for small enough resistance the hysteresis disappears @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that shunting is able to influence the phase - slip events , and hence can be used for control of dissipation and coherence in nanowires @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical mechanisms involved in the formation of the hysteresis are still not clear , and the ways of how shunting drives the phase - slip events are not fully apprehended . in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of the resistive state in a narrow superconducting channel shunted by an external resistor and explore the bifurcation mechanisms involved in the hysteresis of cvcs and also responsible for formation and evolution of pscs .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model , which we used to study the properties of the superconducting channels . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the behaviour of the resistive state of the unshunted channels for different values of the parameter @xmath2 , and reveal the bifurcation mechanisms responsible for the destruction of the periodic dynamics at the retrapping current .",
    "we study the superconducting channels shunted with an external resistance in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in the sec . v.",
    "in the present paper we study the properties of a superconducting channel of the length @xmath0 by simulation of the dimensionless time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations ( tdgles ) @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the dimensionless complex op , where @xmath18 is the amplitude and @xmath19 is the phase of the op .",
    "the distance is measured in units of the coherence length @xmath20 and time is measured in units of the phase relaxation time @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the penetration depth , @xmath23 is the normal state conductivity , and @xmath24 is the speed of light . the electrostatic potential @xmath25 is measured in the units of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the electronic charge and @xmath28 is the planck constant , the dimensionless current density @xmath1 is defined in the units of @xmath29 .",
    "the penetration depth of electric field @xmath30 is an additional parameter , which characterizes the nonequilibrium superconductors . from eqs .",
    "( [ tdgl1 ] , [ curr1 ] ) it follows that @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath2 characterizes the penetration of the electric field in the nonequilibrium superconductors .",
    "notably , the value of the parameter @xmath2 introduced in the previous section depends on the material of superconductor .",
    "let us discuss the range of applicability of the tdgles in more details .",
    "one of the first attempts to analyse the simplified version of the tdgles similar to eqs .",
    "( [ tdgl1],[curr1 ] ) was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "tdgles with @xmath32 were used to describe the gapless case with large concentration of magnetic impurities @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the scattering time on magnetic impurities , and @xmath35 is the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "note that in the gapless case the tdgles can be rigorously derived from the microscopic theory . in that respect",
    "they are exact and are valid in the broad range of temperatures .",
    "more realistic generalized tdgles were derived by kramer and watts - tobin @xcite .",
    "their version of the tdgles with @xmath36 takes into account inelastic scattering by phonons and are valid for dirty superconductors with a finite energy gap @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is impurity scattering time . in the the dirty limit the inelastic scattering time is large .",
    "it leads to the enhancement of the penetration depth of the electric field @xmath39 .",
    "this process can be described by the generalized tdgles @xcite assuming that @xmath2 is small enough ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "note that the generalized tdgles have an additional time derivative term which can lead to different dynamics at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "however , as it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( eq.(196 ) and fig .",
    "8 , page 499 ) , this term does not affect the dynamics of the solution at large currents , while in the vicinity of the critical current the influence of this term has quantitative character . therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ tdgl1 ] , [ curr1 ] ) describe well the gapless superconductors with large concentrations of magnetic impurities as well as superconductors with the gap near @xmath41 . on the other hand variation of the parameter @xmath2",
    "allows us to describe qualitatively ordinary superconductors in the dirty limit in the large temperature range .",
    "definitely tdgles can not be used to reveal the properties of the superconducting channels at @xmath42 .",
    "however , some qualitative predictions based on this model can be used to describe quantum phase slips in this limit @xcite .    in the present paper we model a thin superconducting channel connected at the edges to the bulk superconductors . in this case , the boundary conditions are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where the phase @xmath19 and modulus @xmath18 of the op satisfy the relation @xmath45 .",
    "the absence of the electric field at the edges of the channel determines the gradient of phase @xmath46 .",
    "in this section we study the superconducting channels of the lengths @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . here",
    "we use the ginzburg - landau depairing current for a channel of a finite length @xmath50 as the reference point defining @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the ginzburg - landau depairing current for an infinite channel .    the value of the parameter @xmath2 plays the crucial role in the process of creation of the pscs .",
    "similarly to the results of the previous research @xcite , we found out that critical value of the parameter @xmath2 , @xmath54 , corresponds to the change of the dynamics of the pscs .",
    "actually , for @xmath4 the phase of the op @xmath19 relaxes faster then the amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "it leads to the appearance of the pscs at the same spot of the channel , one after another ( figs .",
    "1a - 1c ) .",
    "our simulations suggest that such behavior of the pscs remains qualitatively the same for any studied channel s length , and any studied value of the applied current . for @xmath55 the amplitude @xmath18 relaxes faster then the phase @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the pscs can emerge in different regions of the channel ( fig .",
    "hence , one can distinguish three different ways for the appearance of the pscs : 1 .",
    "there is only one psc and the amplitude of the op reaches zero several times at the same location .",
    "this is the case of the consecutive pscs ; 2 .",
    "there are more than one pscs and the amplitude of the op reaches zero at the same time at all locations ; 3 .",
    "there are more than one pscs , but the amplitude of the op reaches zero at a different time for each location .",
    "hereafter we refer to the cases 2 . and 3 .",
    "as to the case of simultaneous pscs .",
    "besides @xmath3 , we reveal another critical value of the parameter @xmath2 , @xmath56 , which in contrast to @xmath3 depends on the length of the channel .",
    "the critical values , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , divide the parameter plane @xmath57 into the regions corresponding to the different type of solutions of the tdgles ( see fig .",
    "dynamics of psc for @xmath58 ( domain ss in fig.2 ) was partly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the first psc appears in the center of the channel ( see fig .",
    "1c ) , and cvc in the vicinity of @xmath59 can be approximated as @xmath60 ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "3 ) . analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the period of op oscillations in the vicinity of @xmath59 for @xmath61 is described by formula @xmath62^{-1/2}. \\label{period}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ period ] ) ( solid and dashed lines in fig.4b , which correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively ) demonstrates excellent agreement with the results of the numerical simulations ( squares and triangles in fig .",
    "the increase of the current leads to the period - doubling bifurcation , which implies a sudden increase of the period at @xmath65 for @xmath47 and @xmath63 , @xmath66 for @xmath48 and @xmath63 , and @xmath67 for @xmath48 and @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , and corresponds to the change of the spatial position of the pscs : two adjacent pscs appear symmetrically with respect to the center of the wire ( fig .",
    "1d ) . within the ss region in fig .",
    "2 it is also possible to find more complex solution of the tdgles , which are characterized by larger number of the pscs @xcite . remarkably that the appearance of every new psc induces a jump in the cvc as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    the hc regime in fig .",
    "2 corresponds to the qualitatively different behaviour of the cvcs .",
    "when @xmath68 , the steady - state solution is stable ( see insets to figs . 3a and 3b ) .",
    "however , the increase of @xmath1 induces the voltage drop along the superconducting channel .",
    "the critical current @xmath69 corresponding to this bifurcation is called the switching current @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "this switching is associated with the appearance of a single psc in the center of the channel ( fig .",
    ". further increase of @xmath1 does not change the spacial position of the pscs , but decreases the period of the tdgles solution .",
    "the op is strongly suppressed in the small region in the center of the channel .",
    "the dimensionless amplitude of the op in this area is @xmath71 , while at the edges of the channel @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "the period of the solution tends to zero with increase of the current ( see fig .",
    "4a and inset to fig .",
    "if now one decreases the current , the superconducting state restores for @xmath73 indicating of the presence of a hysteresis .",
    "the critical current , @xmath74 , below which the superconducting state reappears is known as the retrapping current @xcite .",
    "the cvcs of the channels in the hc regime has a pronounced tail in the vicinity of @xmath9 ( see inset of fig .",
    "the finite effective resistance appears in the range of @xmath75 , which induces the change of the slope of the cvc .",
    "similar effects were reported in @xcite for capacitively shunted josephson junctions .",
    "however , in contrast to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the system under consideration demonstrates a hysteretic type of cvcs .",
    "for @xmath75 the psc appears in the center of the channel with significantly lower value of the voltage and higher value of the period comparing to the case of @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "such behaviour of the pscs is similar to the case of @xmath61 , when we observe one psc in the middle of the channel in the vicinity of @xmath50 .",
    "the effective resistance of the channel grows with increase of the value of the parameter @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "however , for a large range of @xmath1 it still remains much lower than the effective resistance of the normal state ( solid line on fig .",
    "3 ) . nevertheless , with increase of the current the cvc of the superconducting channel in the resistive state approaches the cvc of the normal state .",
    "these results are in agreement with the experimental results @xcite , where the cvcs of the superconducting channels at various temperatures have been investigated .",
    "the hysteretic behaviour of the cvcs in the hc regime ( fig .",
    "5a ) can be illustrated by the transition between different solutions of the tdgles .",
    "for @xmath77 the tdgles has only one periodic solution , which is represented in the phase space by a stable limit cycle ( fig .",
    "5b ) , and which corresponds to a single branch in cvc ( see fig .",
    "5a ) . with decrease of @xmath1 , at @xmath69 a pair of steady states",
    "are born in the vicinity of the limit cycle as the result of saddle - node homoclinic bifurcation ( fig .",
    "5c ) . with this ,",
    "one of these steady states is stable , whereas another one is unstable .",
    "the coexistence of two stable solutions ( bistability ) , a steady state and the limit cycle , for @xmath73 stipulates two branches in the hysteretic cvc illustrated in fig .",
    "2b and fig .",
    "5a . with further decrease of @xmath1",
    "the limit cycle approaches to the unstable steady state ( fig .",
    "5d ) , and at @xmath74 they collide and disappear , suggesting a homoclinic bifurcation ( fig .",
    "5e ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , that in the vicinity of this bifurcation the period of the limit cycle can be approximated by the logarithmic law ( thin solid lines on fig . 4a and inset to fig .",
    "4b ) , similarly to the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath78 . \\label{period_sw}\\ ] ] for smaller current @xmath75 the only limit solution of the system is the stable steady state , which corresponds to a single branch in the cvc in fig .",
    "2b and fig . 5a .",
    "thus , the destruction of the periodic solution at the retrapping current is associated with a homoclinic bifurcation @xcite .",
    "note that the similar way of disappearance of op oscillations was described in @xcite .",
    "however , a particular instability leading to the destruction of the periodic solution was not revealed .",
    "the length of the superconducting channel @xmath0 strongly affects formation of pscs , and correspondingly cvcs .",
    "for example , in the case of the longer channels @xmath79 the value of @xmath5 drops below @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "it leads to the unusual behaviour of the cvcs ( see graph for @xmath80 in fig .",
    "3b ) for @xmath81 ( hs domain in fig .",
    "2 ) comparing with the cvcs corresponding to the other domains .",
    "such unusual shape of cvcs can be understood in terms of evolution of psc in the case of @xmath48 , @xmath80 ( full circles in fig .",
    "3b ) . for these parameter values a single psc ( fig .",
    "1c ) appears in the center of the channel in the vicinity of @xmath7 .",
    "then , at the critical current corresponding to the period - doubling bifurcation , two pscs appear symmetrically with respect to the center of the channel ( fig .",
    "the cvc and the period of the solution behave hysteretically in the vicinity of the period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "then , at higher currents , the system switches to the hc regime , where a single psc ( fig .",
    "1b ) appears in the center of the channel with the period lower than one of psc in the vicinity of @xmath50 .",
    "since the value of @xmath3 in this case is close to @xmath82 , the value of the switching current ( @xmath83 ) is quite close to the value of the retrapping current ( @xmath84 ) .    in the case of the shorter channels @xmath85 there is another characteristic range of @xmath86 ( domain sc in fig .",
    "2 ) . for these values of @xmath2",
    "the pscs always appear in the center of the channel .",
    "note that in this case the cvc of the channel also possesses the step - like behaviour ( stars on fig .",
    "3a ) . however , the change of the slope of cvc is not accompanied by creation of a new psc .",
    "the period of the solution also remains unchanged ( stars on fig .",
    "such behaviour of the cvc is similar to one in the hc regime , where a tail of cvc appears for @xmath75 .",
    "however , in the former case the change of the slope of the cvc is more smooth .",
    "the absence of the period doubling bifurcation for @xmath86 is in agreement with the previous results @xcite , where it was shown that for @xmath4 the pscs appear consecutively .",
    "the values of the switching @xmath7 and retrapping @xmath9 currents are equal in the ss and sc regime ( see fig . 6 ) .",
    "as it has been shown above , exceeding the critical value @xmath5 leads to the hysteretic behaviour of the cvc .",
    "it corresponds to the appearance of the difference between the critical currents ( domain hc on fig .",
    "increase of the length of the channel causes decrease of the critical value @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 becomes smaller than @xmath3 , domain sc disappears .",
    "it corresponds to the appearance of the hs domain and shift of the ss domain to the region of small @xmath2 , @xmath55 .    as it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "2 , @xmath5 sharply increases with decrease of the length of the channel @xmath0 .",
    "it leads to the step like behaviour of the cvc for the very narrow channels .",
    "as it has been shown before , the cvc in the vicinity of the ginzburg - landau depairing current shows the square root behaviour in this region of the parameters @xcite .",
    "it is in the agreement with the earlier result of aslamazov , and larkin @xcite , who have considered the cvc of the short ( @xmath87 ) superconducting bridge .",
    "in this section we discuss the properties of a superconducting channel shunted with external resistors of different conductivity .",
    "shunting the superconducting channel leads to decrease of the current flowing through the superconducting cannel .",
    "therefore total current is defined as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the conductivity of the shunt , and electric field in the shunt is defined as @xmath90 . in our study we fixed the value of @xmath91 , which corresponds to a hysteretic cvc ( see fig .",
    "3 ) for an unshunted channel ( i.e. of a channel with @xmath92 ) . for @xmath91 and @xmath92 a single psc ( fig .",
    "7a ) appears for any values of @xmath1 , however , increase of @xmath89 can dramatically affect the periodicity of the pscs .",
    "for example , for @xmath93 a single psc appears in the vicinity of the switching current during the up - sweep of @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "7a ) . at the same time",
    ", down - sweep of @xmath1 induces a second psc in the middle of the channel ( fig .",
    "7b ) . approaching the retrapping current @xmath9 increases the pscs number , and ,",
    "finally , destroys the periodic solution . with this , every change of the periodicity of the psc induces a discontinuity of the period of the solution of the tdgles ( fig . 8) .",
    "growth of @xmath89 is accompanied by the increase of @xmath9 , however , the value of @xmath7 remains constant .",
    "therefore , at certain critical value of @xmath94 the value of @xmath9 and @xmath7 coincides and the hysteresis disappears .",
    "similar experimental results were obtained in ref .",
    "it was shown that shunting the superconducting channel with external resistors with different conductivities lead to different cvcs ( see fig .",
    "2a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if the conductivity of the shunt exceeds a certain critical value , then the cvc has the step - like structure .",
    "in the opposite case the cvcs have hysteretic character , in agreement with our calculations .",
    "it should be noted however that the independence of @xmath7 upon @xmath89 in our calculations is inconsistent with the earlier experimental results @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency may be associated with the neglecting of thermodynamic fluctuations in our model , whereas the values of @xmath7 may be sensitive to the thermodynamic fluctuations .    above the critical value of the conductivity , the dependencies of the voltage @xmath95 and the period of oscillations of op @xmath96 on @xmath1",
    "become quite complicated ( see fig . 9 and inset to fig .",
    "8) . for @xmath97 the dependencies @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "demonstrate irregularities for low values of @xmath1 .",
    "these irregularities are associated with appearance of new patterns in pscs formation characterizing by different numbers of psc .",
    "for high conductivity @xmath100 , the irregularities in the dependencies @xmath98 and @xmath99 shift towards larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , for the channel of the length @xmath101 the critical value of @xmath102 .",
    "interesting that for @xmath103 a final voltage along the channel correspond to appearance of two ( not one ! ) pscs in the center of the channel ( fig .",
    "7b ) , which is similar to the results published in ref .",
    "@xcite moreover , within a feasible range of @xmath1 we were unable to find a regime with only one psc in the channel .",
    "increase of @xmath1 upto 1.035 and 1.056 for @xmath104 8 and 10 respectively induces a third psc in the middle of the channel ( fig .",
    "7c ) , while further increases of @xmath1 upto 1.1 and 1.14 for @xmath104 8 and 10 respectively adds one more psc ( fig .",
    "remarkably , the pscs for the above values of @xmath1 are rapidly follow one after another with relatively long time interval , which separates next group of pscs . the number of pscs per period increases quickly with the increase of @xmath1 , which finally leads to the irregular behaviour of the period of op ( fig . 8)",
    "in conclusion , we revealed the dynamical mechanisms involved in the formation of the hysteresis , and showed how shunting drives the phase - slip events .",
    "we also studied the dynamics of the resistive state in a narrow superconducting channel shunted by an external resistor , and explored the bifurcation mechanisms which are responsible for formation and evolution of pscs and which are also involved in the hysteresis of cvcs .",
    "we have investigated the current - voltage characteristics of the superconducting channels of a different length .",
    "we have found two critical values of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "they induce the change of the dynamics of the solution of the tdgles .",
    "one of them is independent on the length of the channel ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "it governs the periodicity and spatial position of the pscs .",
    "they can be found in two regimes : simultaneous and consecutive ones .",
    "the second critical value of the parameter @xmath2 depends on the length of the channel ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "it changes the behaviour of the cvc from the step like to the hysteretic . as a result",
    ", the phase diagram showing the regions of stability of different solutions of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations can be divided to four regions corresponding to the step like current - voltage characteristics and the hysteretic one for the consecutive and simultaneous phase slip centers .",
