    "while most of these authors recognized the presence of an advective - acoustic cycle similar to the one found by foglizzo ( 2002 , hereafter f02 ) in a different context , blondin & mezzacappa ( 2006 , hereafter bm06 ) challenged this interpretation and advocated a purely acoustic mechanism .",
    "understanding the mechanism at work in this instability is a crucial step towards correctly extrapolating its consequences in a more realistic astrophysical situation .",
    "the physics of the advective - acoustic cycle is based on the linear coupling between acoustic and advected perturbations through the flow gradients : both entropy and vorticity perturbations act as source terms for the acoustic wave equation ( foglizzo 2001 , hereafter f01 , and foglizzo & galletti 2003 ) .",
    "this has been known for decades in the field of jet engines , since the pioneering works of candel ( 1972 ) , howe ( 1975 ) , marble & candel ( 1977 ) and abouseif et al .",

    ", this linear coupling is due to the gradients associated with the convergence of the flow , its deceleration , gravity and cooling .",
    "the interaction between the shock and the flow gradients gives birth to an advective - acoustic cycle , in which an advected perturbation generates a pressure feedback which triggers , at the shock , a new advected perturbation .",
    "although foglizzo ( 2002 ) proved the instability of the advective - acoustic cycle in an accelerated isothermal flow , the fate of such cycles in a cooled decelerated flow is still an open question : can they account for the instability observed in the simulations of bm06 ?",
    "the first aim of the present study is to clarify the instability mechanism at work , using perturbative techniques .",
    "the accretion flow is idealized as a perfect gas passing through a stationary shock , and subject to cooling processes schematically described by a cooling function @xmath0 , mimicking in the simplest manner the neutrino cooling in the core - collapse context .",
    "it is the first time that a linear approach has been used to understand the mechanism of this nonradial instability in the core - collapse context .",
    "a first step is to confirm that the dominating @xmath1 mode identified by bm06 in the linear phase of their numerical simulation indeed corresponds to the most unstable eigenmode of the linear problem .    beyond the determination of the eigenspectrum and the validation of numerical simulations , we wish to address the question of the instability mechanism , using techniques similar to f02 .",
    "these techniques allow for a direct interpretation of the full eigenspectrum in terms of the efficiencies of the acoustic cycle and the advective - acoustic cycle .",
    "alternatively , these efficiencies can also be computed in the wkb approximation .",
    "we wish to use both methods in order to check whether the instability is of acoustic or advective - acoustic nature .",
    "understanding the nature of the instability leads us to construct , in a companion paper ( foglizzo et al .",
    "2006 ) , a simple toy model which can be solved analytically and allows us to reach a fundamental understanding of some of the properties of the instability .",
