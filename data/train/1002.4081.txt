    "the calculation of steady - state transport properties of open quantum systems such as quantum dots is a challenging and unsolved problem .",
    "perturbative methods @xcite may be used to study the weak correlation regime , but they fail to provide a reliable description of the competition between kondo- and coulomb - blockade physics in strongly interacting dots @xcite . to avoid these limitations of conventional perturbation theory ,",
    "various non - perturbative numerical approaches have been developed .",
    "time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) calculations @xcite and real - time monte carlo ( rt - mc ) approaches @xcite try to compute the relaxation into the interacting steady state after some switching of parameters , such as voltage bias or interaction . while the short - time transients can be very accurately captured with these methods @xcite , the approach to the steady - state may occur on rather long , in the worst case exponentially large times scales . due to finite - size effects in the tdmrg and an exponentially growing sign problem with increasing time in rt - mc , the access to long times",
    "is severely limited in both approaches .",
    "furthermore , the tdmrg is performed for a finite , closed system ; whether a relaxation to a reasonable approximation of the interacting steady - state is guaranteed for some intermediate time scale much smaller than poincar s recurrence time is not obvious .",
    "this latter problems may be avoided by numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite and functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculations @xcite , which attempt a direct description of the non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "however , the former introduces an artificial discretization and truncation of the spectrum of the hamiltonian , which can lead to artifacts in the time evolution .",
    "the frg , on the other hand , is again perturbative in nature , and experience up to now shows that it works best in the extreme non - equilibrium limit @xcite .",
    "none of the methods developed so far is able to provide a complete and reliable description of the model in all parameter regimes .",
    "more importantly , the most interesting regime , where all relevant energy scales  voltage , temperature , magnetic field etc .  ",
    "are of the same order as the relevant low - energy scale of the model , is usually the one which is not accessible .",
    "therefore , the development of new or improved simulation approaches is a worthwhile and important task .",
    "recently , a new and rather unconventional approach to calculate the steady - state transport through interacting quantum dots or similar structures was proposed by han and heary @xcite .",
    "their formalism , which is based on hershfield s density operator @xcite , maps the non - equilibrium steady - state of the interacting model onto an infinite set of auxiliary equilibrium systems , each characterized by some complex voltage .",
    "the appealing feature of this approach is that powerful methods exist for the numerical solution of equilibrium models .",
    "the complexification of the voltage bias , however , introduces a formidable new problem in the form of an analytical continuation in the voltage on top of the already challenging analytical continuation from matsubara frequencies to real frequencies . in ref .",
    "@xcite this double analytical continuation was performed using a phenomenological formula based on general structures of the self - energy found in second order perturbation theory .",
    "the purpose of this study is to explore to what extent an unbiased numerical implementation of the method by han and heary is feasible .",
    "we will address two issues : ( i ) the use of recently developed , accurate continuous - time quantum monte - carlo ( ct - qmc ) algorithms to simulate quantum impurity models as solvers for the effective equilibrium impurity problems with complex voltage bias ; and ( ii ) the analytical continuation of matsubara frequency data via some maximum entropy method . in particular , we will compare the performance of the weak - coupling @xcite and hybridization expansion @xcite algorithms and propose a kernel for the maximum entropy ( me ) procedure which is compatible with the analytical properties of the green function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ han ] describes the imaginary - time approach to steady state transport by han and heary . a brief introduction to the ct - qmc for equilibrium problems and their suitability for models with complex voltage bias follows in section  [ qmc ] .",

    "we will finish the paper with a conclusion and outlook in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we briefly review the imaginary - time formulation of steady - state transport through an interacting quantum dot proposed by han and heary @xcite , which is based on the work of hershfield @xcite .",
    "we consider a spin - degenerate , single - level quantum dot attached to two non - interacting fermionic leads .",

    "the index @xmath4 denotes the wave - vector of the lead states and @xmath5 the spin quantum number .",
    "a gate voltage @xmath6 may be applied to shift the dot energy level position relative to the particle - hole symmetric configuration @xmath7 .    to keep things simple , we assume a @xmath4-independent hybridization @xmath8 and",
    "consider the wide - band limit for the dispersion of the leads .",
    "we then end up with a bare level broadening @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the density of states of the leads at the fermi energy .    in the case of non - equilibrium steady - state transport",
    ", the leads are supposed to be unaffected by the current flowing through the dot and characterized by free fermion correlators @xmath12 with @xmath13 the fermi distribution function for inverse temperature @xmath14 and @xmath15 the value of the chemical potential for lead @xmath16 . we restrict ourselves to the case where the inverse temperatures of the left and right lead are the same , @xmath17 , and symmetrically applied voltage bias , @xmath18 .",
    "the bias voltage is denoted by @xmath19 .      in ref .",
    ", hershfield introduced a hermitian operator @xmath20 by means of which the non - equilibrium , steady - state expectation value of a local observable @xmath21 may be written as @xmath22 the above expectation value is of the form @xmath23 , and hence resembles the equilibrium expression . under certain assumptions involving the non - trivial exchange of limiting procedures ,",
    "the operator @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath24 where the scattering states @xmath25 are related to the bare conduction states @xmath26 by the second - quantized lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite @xmath27 the liouvillians are defined as @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] , with @xmath30 the hybridization part of the hamiltonian .",

    "it is impossible to calculate an explicit expression for the @xmath20-operator . more importantly ,",
    "although @xmath36 looks like an effective hamiltonian for the system , it can not be used to define a consistent description of imaginary - time and real - time dynamics .",
    "the real - time dynamics is always controlled by @xmath34 alone , but @xmath34 and @xmath36 will in general have a different spectrum . therefore , the analytically continued imaginary - time dynamics does not reproduce the real - time dynamics .      since @xmath36 does not yield the correct real - time dynamics , han and heary @xcite introduce an additional trick .",
    "starting with a fully established non - interacting steady - state ensemble at time @xmath37 , the fully interacting steady state is formally reached by propagating the system to @xmath38 . in a path integral representation the expectation value for an observable @xmath21 becomes @xmath39 a(\\{\\psi_{\\alpha k \\sigma}^\\dagger(0 ) , \\psi_{\\alpha k \\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}(0)\\ } ) { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}^{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}\\int_0^\\infty l(t){\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\ , } } } } } \\right\\rangle_0.\\ ] ] here , the average @xmath40 is performed using eq .   with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 can be explicitly constructed using non - interacting scattering states .",
    "it was argued in ref .   that the time evolution via @xmath34 maps the non - interacting scattering states to the interacting ones and the lagrangian for the real - time evolution reads @xmath44 aiming at a description which yields @xmath45 as real - time evolution operator for @xmath46 and @xmath47 as imaginary - time evolution operator for @xmath48 , the lagrangian is reexpressed with respect to the spectrum of @xmath36 , @xmath49 .",
    "statistical expectation values take a form analogous to equilibrium expectation values , with a uniform fermi level @xmath50 .",
    "due to the discrepancy between @xmath34 and @xmath36 , the real - time lagrangian transforms to @xmath51 , so the effective fermi levels of left and right leads have different time evolution rates .",
    "these rates can be factored out as time - dependent phase factors of the grassmann fields by introducing new field variables @xmath52 .",
    "the extra time evolution rate is generated by @xmath53 acting on the phase factor , and thus @xmath54 describes the correct time evolution .",
    "to obtain a matsubara - like theory , the fields @xmath55 are now wick rotated , @xmath56 . however , under the replacement @xmath57 the exponential factor becomes @xmath58 , which means that it diverges as @xmath59 and decays as @xmath60 . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "han and heary introduce a second analytic continuation to ensure matsubara s periodic boundary conditions and thereby obtain a well - defined effective equilibrium system .",
    "this is achieved by complexifying the voltage occurring in the extra time evolution rate according to @xmath61 , @xmath62 . for the particular choice @xmath63 the matsubara boundary conditions",
    "are conserved @xcite .",
    "the final result of these manipulations is that both the lagrangian and the fields now have their time evolution with respect to the effective equilibrium hamiltonian @xmath64 . in a perturbative expansion around the non - interacting limit , one may then switch to the interaction picture with respect to the non - interacting effective hamiltonian @xmath65 .",
    "as before , @xmath43 is hershfield s boundary condition operator for the corresponding fully established non - interacting steady state , for which an explicit expression can be given .    we may now proceed along the usual lines and integrate out the conduction electron degrees of freedom to obtain an effective action    @xmath66    for the electrons on the dot .",
    "as we are by construction in the stationary state , the bare dot green s function @xmath67 appearing in the quadratic term in the action ( [ action ] ) depends on the time difference only .",
    "we therefore may perform a fourier transform to fermionic matsubara frequencies and find the form @xcite @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the desired green s function for the stationary state of the interacting system is finally obtained by solving the quantum impurity problem for each @xmath72 , @xmath73 , performing the analytical continuation @xmath74 and evaluating the resulting expression at the physical voltage @xmath75 .",
    "although the preceding discussion seems to be based on simple manipulations of the functional integral , one has to show formally the equivalence of the complexified auxiliary equilibrium time - evolution based on the action ( [ action ] ) and the actual physical time evolution with respect to @xmath34 as given by ( [ eq : true_t_evolution ] ) after the analytical continuation @xmath76 in the former .",
    "up to now such a formal proof is still lacking , only an argument based on the inspection of the contributions to perturbation expansion has been put forward @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if an unbiased numerical implementation of this formalism is possible and produces physically meaningful results .",
    "in order to compute the self - energy from action ( [ action ] ) as a function of matsubara frequency we employ continuous - time monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) solvers . the continuous - time monte carlo technique in the weak - coupling @xcite and hybridization expansion @xcite formulation has been discussed in considerable detail in the literature and we will present here merely a short summary of the formalism . the idea is to expand the partition function @xmath77 $ ] into a series of diagrams , and to sample ( collections of ) these diagrams by a monte carlo procedure .",
    "we split the hamiltonian @xmath34 of the impurity model into two parts , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and employ an interaction representation in which the time evolution of operators is given by @xmath78 : @xmath80 . in this interaction representation",
