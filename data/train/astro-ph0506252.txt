    "most of these studies rely on infrared , submillimeter , or millimeter wavelength emission as the signature of small ( @xmath16 1 mm ) warm dust particles , which trace only a small fraction of the circumstellar gas and solid particles . in their initial active accretion phase ,",
    "circumstellar disks are composed of primordial molecular cloud material , possibly somewhat processed by the collapse through the accretion shock onto the disk , with gaseous hydrogen and helium constituting @xmath17 of the total mass and with @xmath18 of the disk mass in small dust particles .",
    "as infall from the cloud onto the star+disk system diminishes , the gas and dust components of the disk evolve , presumably losing most of the gas via accretion onto the central star or photoevaporation back to the interstellar medium ( hollenbach et al .",

    "1996 , weidenschilling 1977 , 1997 ) . during these processes ,",
    "the circumstellar disk undergoes a transition from being optically thick and ( mostly ) gaseous to becoming optically thin and ( mostly ) dusty .",
    "there have been many theoretical and observational studies of disks in various stages of evolution pointing towards such a sequence ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1997 , suttner & yorke 2001 , throop et al .",

    "such studies have , however , concentrated only on the more readily observed dust emission from the disk , and suggest the evolution of dust to larger particle sizes and hence lower opacity ( miyake and nakagawa , 1993 )",
    ".    observations of gas and its evolution are in their infancy .",
    "most studies to date have probed either at near infrared wavelengths ( often co vibrational transitions ) the very hot inner surface regions less than about 1 au from the star ( carr , mathieu & najita 2001 , brittain et al .",

    "the millimeter observations are generally not sensitive to gas at @xmath16 30 au because the lines become beam  diluted and weak . in addition",
    ", the trace species used as millimeter wavelength probes of gas may freeze out onto grain surfaces at @xmath19 30 au , making these observations somewhat unreliable for estimating gas masses ( e.g. , van dishoeck 2004 ) .",
    "the presence or absence of gas in the planet - forming 130 au regions is difficult to constrain from observations in the near infrared or at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "temperatures in these regions may range from 300 50 k , and warm gas emitting at these temperatures is best probed in the mid  infrared lines of h@xmath3 at 28.2 and 17.0 @xmath4 m , and the mid  infrared fine structure lines of abundant ions and atoms , like [ si ] 25.2 @xmath4 m ( gorti & hollenbach 2004 , hereafter gh04 ) .",
    "these lines are difficult or impossible to observe from the ground .",
    "furthermore , the strong dust continuum of very young objects makes the line to continuum ratio quite low , and the background noise high , unless the lines are spectroscopically resolved ( requiring resolving powers from 30,000100,000 ) .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) provided some tantalizing evidence for long  lived gas  rich disks by observing mid  infrared emission lines of h@xmath3 toward debris disk candidates ( thi et al .",
    "however , ground  based observations ( richter et al . 2002 , sheret et al . 2003 , sako et al .",
    "2005 ) , fuse results ( lecavalier des etangs et al .",
    "2001 ) , and spitzer observations ( chen et al 2004 ) have called some of these results into question . recently",
    ", ground - based ir and space - based uv observations have detected rovibrational ( e.g. , bary et al .",

    "2002 ) h@xmath3 emission towards young disks .",
    "the fluorescent h@xmath3 emission is found to occur from gas that is warm and probably located within a few au of the star .",
    "the narrow linewidths of the rovibrational ir emission suggests that the emission occurs at much larger distances from the star ( @xmath2010 au ) , and arises either from non - thermal uv pumping or from the x - ray heating of a very small amount of h@xmath3 gas located in the low - density upper atmosphere .",
    "the likely non - thermal excitation of the h@xmath3 seen both in the ir and uv makes it difficult to convert the detected line strengths into gas masses .    the nature of gas and dust evolution in circumstellar disks is an intriguing problem for various reasons .",
    "a determination of the gas dispersal timescales is important for understanding the formation of planetary systems , and specifically for discriminating between the two competing theories that exist for gas giant planet formation .",
    "core accretion theories for forming gas giants ( e.g. lissauer et al .",
    "1993 , pollack et al .",
    "1996 , kornet et al .",
    "2002 , hubickyj , bodenheimer , & lissauer 2004 ) require long ( @xmath21 myr ) gas disk lifetimes to facilitate the formation of rocky cores of a few earth masses and their subsequent gas accretion to form planets .",
    "detection of gas in older ( @xmath22 year ) disks would help validate the efficacy of this scenario .",
    "the alternate theory of gravitational instability in disks ( e.g. , boss 2003 ) allows the formation of gas giants quickly and the gas may dissipate rapidly .",
    "the presence of small amounts of gas in the `` terrestrial '' zone , @xmath23 au , in later evolutionary stages ( @xmath24 10 myrs ) influences the dynamics of the smaller planets and planetesimals and is decisive in the final outcome of the planetary system ( agnor & ward 2002 ; kominami & ida 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "only a narrow range of gas masses ( @xmath25 m@xmath8 ) in this stage of terrestrial planet formation allow for the formation of an earth - sized planet in an orbit as circular as the earth .",
    "at even later stages ( @xmath26 years ) in disk evolution , small masses of gas ( @xmath25 m@xmath8 ) can affect dust dynamics via drag forces and hence significantly influence disk structure ( klahr & lin 2001 , takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 , takeuchi & lin 2002 ) , weakening interpretations of gaps and ring signatures as being due to the presence of planets .",
    "this paper highlights the potential of the recently launched spitzer space telescope in detecting small amounts of gas ( or setting stringent limits on gas mass ) in the planet  forming regions of disks around nearby young stars .",
    "the spitzer space telescope is able to observe the thermal emission from deep layers in the planet - forming zone , sampling significant mass in this 0.330 au intermediate zone inaccessible to most other techniques .",
    "gas in these regions is likely to be warm ( @xmath27 k ) and line emission at the mid - infrared ( @xmath28 m ) wavelengths seen by the spitzer infrared spectrometer ( irs ) instrument can probe total gas masses as small as @xmath29m@xmath8 in the inner ( @xmath30 20 au ) regions around nearby ( @xmath31 pc ) stars ( gh04 ) .",
    "gas line diagnostics in the spitzer band include the s(0 ) , s(1 ) and s(2 ) pure rotational lines of h@xmath3 , atomic fine structure lines of [ si ] , [ fei ] , [ siii ] , [ feii ] and molecular lines of oh and h@xmath3o ( gh04 ) .    the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) spitzer legacy science project ( meyer et al 2005 ) aims to study the evolution of gas in disks by targeting a carefully chosen sample of about 40 nearby solar - type stars for high resolution ( r@xmath32 700 ) spectroscopic observations by the irs ( houck et al .",
    "the sample was selected mainly on the criteria that they span an age range of 3 - 100 myr , and that they be nearby ( @xmath33 pc ) so that the expected weak line fluxes may be detectable with the irs .",
    "a secondary criterion was that they show some infrared excess emission indicative of the presence of dusty disks .",
    "to some extent , we favored sources with strong x ray luminosities , since the x rays heat the putative gas and intensify the resultant line luminosities .",
    "this will be the most comprehensive survey to date of gas in transition and post - accretion systems in order to characterize its dissipation and to place limits on the time available for giant planet formation .    in this paper , we present high resolution irs data and detailed modeling results for one of the first sources observed through the feps gas program , hd  105 .",
    "hd  105 is a young ( @xmath1 myr ) solar - type star 40 pc from the sun with an infrared excess indicative of a dust disk ( meyer et al .",
    "the star has completed its active accretion phase and the dust continuum is characteristic of an optically thin , debris disk .",
    "the youth and proximity of the star , the presence of dust ( which may imply associated gas ) , the relatively low dust continuum luminosity that allows the detection of weak gas lines , and the presence of x - ray flux from the central star ( a source of gas heating ) make hd  105 a promising candidate for the detection of mid - infrared gas lines . _ spitzer spectroscopic observations of hd  105 , however , did not detect any gas emission lines , but instead set stringent upper limits on the line fluxes . _",
    "the line flux upper limits are used to set limits on the gas surface density and mass in hd  105 . assuming that the gas distribution has an inner hole of radius @xmath10 greater than about 0.5 au",
    ", we find that there is very little gas in the disk beyond the inner hole , suggesting the end of the main planet - building epoch for gas giants in these regions .",
    "debris disks have been observed around early ( e.g. , 49 cet , a1v ) and late - type ( e.g. , au mic ; miv ) stars and are often characterized by their fractional infrared luminosities , @xmath34 , which range from @xmath35 .",
    "hd  105 is thus a somewhat luminous debris disk , with a fractional infrared luminosity , @xmath36 .",
    "the disk may have evolved past its main planet formation stage , and is young enough to perhaps be a `` transition object '' with some residual , detectable gas . though gas is readily detected in young disks ( ages @xmath24 a few myrs , and @xmath37 , e.g. dent et al .",
    "2005 ) , most debris disks do not appear to have detectable amounts of gas .",
    "notable exceptions are the disks around 49 cet(@xmath38 ) and @xmath39 pictoris(@xmath38 ) . co emission has been observed from the j@xmath40 ( dent et al .",
    "2005 ) and the j@xmath41 ( zuckerman , forveille & kastner 1995 ) transitions from the disk around 49 cet , and iso detected h@xmath3 @xmath42 m emission as well ( thi et al .",
    ". in @xmath39 pic gas emission from metal atoms and ions orbiting in a disk has been reported , most recently by brandeker et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "they and thebault & augereau ( 2005 ) derive gas masses in the disk of @xmath43 m@xmath44 .",
    "this amount of gas is insufficient to brake the ions against radiation pressure ; both groups estimate @xmath45 m@xmath44 is needed for braking .",
    "chen et al . ( 2004 ) obtain upper limits on _ warm _ gas in @xmath39 pic of about 11 m@xmath44 , although these spitzer observations of the pure rotational lines of h@xmath3 are not sensitive to the presence of cold ( @xmath46 k ) or atomic gas .",
    "the directly detected gas suggests gas depletion in debris disks relative to the dust , in the few instances where gas has been observed .",
    "hd  105 is the first debris disk observed in our feps h@xmath3 program aimed at studying gas dispersal in disks as they evolve .",
    "as we shall show below , depending on the gas temperature , spitzer is able to detect gas masses @xmath47 m@xmath48 for sources as close as hd  105 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the source (  2 ) , and discuss the analysis of the spitzer observations (  3 ) .",

    "we obtained 9.9 - 37.2@xmath4 m  spectra of hd  105 on december 14 , 2003 ut using the infrared spectrograph ( irs , houck et al .",

    "the spectra were acquired using the standard staring mode aot , in which the telescope is nodded to place the star at two positions along each slit , resulting in four separate pointings ( two for sh , and two for lh ) . for the sh observations , we used integration times of 31.5 seconds for each data collection event ( dce ) , and cycled eight times for a total on - source exposure time of 504 seconds . for lh",

    "high accuracy blue peak up ( @xmath59 m ) was performed on the star to ensure a pointing accuracy within 0@xmath60.4 .",
    "the brightness profile of hd  105 in the peak up image agrees with that expected from the point spread function .",
    "individual dces were processed through the ssc pipeline ( version s10.5.0 ) resulting in basic calibrated data ( bcd ) products to which basic detector calibrations , dark current subtraction , cosmic ray detection , integration ramp fitting , and reduction to individual , two - dimensional slope images in units of electrons / second / pixel have been applied .",
    "dark current measurements taken with the lh module within 12 hours of the hd  105 observations were used to mitigate the effects of outlier pixels whose dark currents vary on timescales of one to several days , rather than using standard dark current subtraction which employs darks taken over a wider separation in time .",
    "the number of lh outlier pixels ( high dark current pixels not representative of expected gaussian noise ) is less than 6% of the 128@xmath61128 pixels on the array .",
    "however , they may dominate the noise within each echelle order if untreated .",
    "corrections were applied to pixels flagged as anomalous in the pipeline , due to cosmic - ray saturation early in the integration , or having been preflagged as unresponsive . for these pixels",
    "we applied cubic spline interpolation technique , relying on 1.5 resolution elements on either side of the dead pixels in the dispersion direction .",
    "this signal reconstruction method has been successfully verified with observations of spectral standards exhibiting resolved and unresolved emission lines , particularly for the lh array .",
    "individual 1-dimensional spectra were extracted from two dimensional images flat  fielded with observations of the zodiacal background .",
    "we used the offline ssc software to extract these spectra using the full width of each echelle order .",
    "spectral response and flux calibration corrections were applied to these 1-dimensional spectra .",
    "the response functions and flux calibration are based on similarly processed and spatially flatfielded observations of photometric standards hr  6688 ( k2iii ) , hr  6705 ( k1.5iii ) , hr  7310 ( g9iii ) , and hr  2194 ( a0v ) , and the marcs - code stellar atmosphere models tailored for these stars ( decin et al .",

    "each order was trimmed , removing @xmath245% of the data at the blue ends where the throughput response of the arrays is lowest .",
    "the signal - to - noise in the continuum is lower than the signal - to - noise that would be inferred from repeatability among the 16 spectra .",
    "this suggests that the signal - to - noise is limited by residual errors due to fringing , uncertainty in the spectra response function and anomalous pixels among others . the errors in absolute fluxes , which here include both the star and zodiacal background , are thought to be @xmath24 20 % .",

    "we take one of the more extreme values of the power law of the gas surface density distribution , @xmath67 , which maximizes the gas mass in the outer shielded zones .",
    "the upper limit ( derived from the most sensitive line [ si ] ) to the total gas mass in this extreme case of low @xmath65 is then about 1.9 m@xmath8 for r@xmath68 au , 0.2 m@xmath8 for r@xmath69 au , and 0.1 m@xmath8 for r@xmath70 au , where we basically extrapolate the upper limit on the gas surface density measured at @xmath10 to 40 au .",
    "_ therefore , for @xmath71 au , there is insufficient gas in hd  105 at this time to feed the formation of gas giants_.    table 2 shows that the upper limits to the gas surface density at @xmath10 are not very sensitive to @xmath10 for 1 au @xmath72 au .",
    "larger @xmath10 tends to produce more mass of gas heated by the stellar photons , but , because of the dilution of the stellar flux , also tends to lead to lower characteristic gas temperature .",

    "however , for @xmath73 au , @xmath74 rises steeply .",
    "the heating mechanisms only penetrate to a relatively constant column of @xmath75 @xmath12 so the mass of heated gas scales roughly as @xmath76 , assuming the vertical scale height scales with radius .",
    "therefore , the mass ( or area for optically thick lines ) of heated gas goes down as we move inward , and so the gas temperature must rise appreciably in order for the gas to be detected .",
    "since the gas temperature tends to rise with increasing density , due to the collisional de - excitation of the upper levels of cooling transitions , we require substantially more surface density to raise the temperature sufficiently to overcome the loss of warm gas mass and area .",
    "figure  [ sigma - rin ] visually shows how the critical surface density @xmath74 depends on @xmath10 .",
    "we see that [ si ] 25 @xmath4 m is the most sensitive spitzer line for constraining the gas surface density in gas disks with little dust , like hd  105 .",
    "au , the lines set poor or no limits , as the warm emissive gas gets too optically thick and beam diluted to be detectable by spitzer , regardless of the magnitude of @xmath77 ( see text ) . also shown for comparison is the surface density distribution of the minimum mass solar nebula with radius , @xmath78 g @xmath12 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "if @xmath10 is sufficiently small ( @xmath79 au ) , the gas mass in the disk is essentially unconstrained by the spitzer observations because a very small mass and surface area of inner gas shields the outer regions , leaving them too cold to be detected at this time . clearly , if a line detection is made by spitzer irs , knowledge of the parameter @xmath10 is extremely helpful if the line flux is to be converted into @xmath74 and @xmath80",

    "it is interesting that the most sensitive indicators of gas are not the h@xmath3 lines , but fine structure lines ( in particular [ si ] 25 @xmath4 m ) of less abundant species ( see gorti & hollenbach 2004 ) .",
    "these upper limits indicate that in this region of possible gas giant planet formation , either a giant planet has already formed or it never will : _ the era of significant gas accretion onto protoplanets is over for this 30 myr old system_.    the main caveat is that if the gas surface density distribution , unlike the dust , extends to the innermost regions ( @xmath81 au ) of the disk , then significant ( i.e. , @xmath82 m@xmath8 ) amounts of cold gas could be hidden in the 5 - 40 au region where gas giant planets may still be accreting , without violating our observational constraints on the line luminosities .",
    "however , if the gas indeed extends to @xmath83 au , then the gas is likely accreting onto the stellar surface .",

    "such high accretion rates would produce diagnostics , such as large uv or near - ir excesses , h@xmath65 emission lines , or other indicators of accretion - driven winds , which are not observed .",
    "therefore , we regard this possibility as unlikely",
    ".    the gas limits in the 10 - 40 au region may also be relevant to theories of the formation of the outer giants such as neptune and uranus .",
    "a generic problem for these systems is that they heat dynamically ( i.e. , induce high random velocities ) the much smaller objects which provide potential coalescent collisions that enable them to grow .",
    "the higher velocities reduce the gravitational focusing , and therefore reduce their growth rate ( levison and stewart 2001 ) . without some kind of dynamical cooling mechanisms , it is difficult for them to form in situ within the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "gas drag is one possibility , but it requires many jupiter masses of gas . our upper limits on the amount of gas indicate that , after 30 myr in hd  105 , there is not nearly enough gas drag to have an appreciable effect ( see , e.g. , goldreich et al .",
    "2004 ) at this time .",
    "takeuchi and artymowicz ( 2001 ) , klahr & lin ( 2001 ) , and takeuchi & lin ( 2002 ) showed that a small amount of gas ( and the effect of stellar photons on the gas and dust ) can sculpt the dust morphology and create an inner hole .",
    "therefore , the sharp inner dust hole at @xmath87 au in hd  105 need not reflect the presence of giant planets , but may be produced in a planet - less gas / dust disk around hd  105 .",
    "these authors show that @xmath88 produces such effects , and that when @xmath89 the dust grains can not migrate effectively relative to the gas . using our upper limits for the case where the gas and dust are co - spatial",
    ", we find that we can only constrain the gas mass to dust mass ratio in hd  105 to values of @xmath90 , and that therefore we can not effectively constrain the effects of gas on the dust dynamics .",
    "in other words , the sharp inner rim of dust implied by the ir continuum sed of hd  105 could be produced by a small amount of gas below our upper limits .",
    "an alternate hypothesis is that in the absence of gas , a giant planet is preventing dust from the outer debris disk from reaching the inner part of the system , as discussed in m04 .",
    "kominami & ida ( 2002 , 2004 ) and agnor & ward ( 2002 ) discuss the effects of a small amount of gas in the terrestrial zone ( 1 - 5 au ) on the resulting formation of terrestrial planets .",
    "if @xmath91 m@xmath8 in the terrestrial zone for tens of millions of years , then lunar and mars - sized planetary embryos feel the dynamical friction of the gas , circularize their orbits , and never collide to form earth - mass planets . on the other hand , if @xmath92 @xmath93 , then the embryos are on eccentric orbits , and collide to form earth - sized or larger orbits , but with eccentricities substantially larger than the earth .",
    "the suggestion is that the earth may have formed with roughly 10@xmath94 m@xmath8 of gas in the terrestrial zone for tens of millions of years .",
    "the terrestrial zone ( @xmath95 au ) in hd  105 is inside @xmath96 and is currently quite dust - free .",
    "our models show that if the gas extends all the way in to @xmath97 au , then we are not sensitive to gas mass in the terrestrial zone , and therefore can not set useful limits on this process .",
    "if for some reason the gas had an inner radius of 0.5  1 au , we can set limits of about @xmath98 to @xmath99 m@xmath8 for the mass of gas from this inner radius to 5 au . in this case , the limits are close to the critical value of @xmath100 m@xmath8 , and indicate perhaps insufficient gas to prevent large , earth - sized planets from forming .",
    "spitzer may be able to set even more stringent limits on this process in other sources . if sufficient small dust is mixed with the gas in the terrestrial zone , then the gas in the models is hotter , and smaller gas masses can be detected .    finally , are these upper limits surprising in the context of theoretical calculations that have been performed on the likely dispersal mechanisms of the gas ?",
    "the current kinematic evidence suggests that hd  105 formed in a small group of tens of stars ( see  2 ) , which likely lacked o or early b - type stars . assuming that hd  105 was not exposed to high uv fluxes from nearby massive stars , the main dispersal mechanism for the outer disk would likely be photoevaporation of the gas by the central star , and for the inner disk viscous accretion and spreading of the gas would dominate ( hollenbach , yorke & johnstone 2000 , clarke et al .",
    "2001 , matsuyama et al . 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to answer this question because of the lack of self consistent photoevaporation models which treat not just the euv ( i.e. , @xmath101 ev ) photons ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "1994 ) , but also the less energetic stellar photons as well as the x rays from the young central star .",
    "gorti & hollenbach ( in preparation ) are developing such models , and their preliminary results show that the less energetic photons rapidly ( in less than 10 myr ) disperse the gas outside of about 30 - 50 au .",
    "the euv photons can potentially remove gas outside of about 1 - 5 au , but the evolution of the euv luminosity and the radiative transfer of these photons as they try to penetrate the protostellar winds in the early stages of star formation are not well determined .",
    "a recent paper by alexander , clarke & pringle ( 2005 ) suggests rather high escaping euv luminosities which may rapidly ( @xmath102 myr ) remove the outer gas .",
    "once the outer disk is removed , viscosity removes the inner gas on timescales which are roughly 0.1 myr ( 0.01/@xmath10310 au ) , where @xmath104 is the turbulent viscosity parameter in the standard `` @xmath65 '' disks .",
    "the value of @xmath104 is typically 10@xmath94 if the balbus & hawley ( 1991 ) magneto - rotational instability , or mri , is operant .",
    "the mri instability requires a minimal level of ionization , which all our relatively low mass models meet . assuming that mri is active , the viscous timescales inside the photoevaporation region ( which lies at @xmath105 au ) are of order 0.03  0.3 myr extremely short ! on the other hand , it is not totally certain that this instability would be fully active ( chiang , fischer , & thommes 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these upper limits are not surprising , but they do set constraints on the rather poorly known dispersal mechanisms .",
    "one of the goals of the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) spitzer legacy project is to measure the evolution and dispersal of gas in the planet - forming regions ( @xmath106 au ) of disks around solar - type stars of ages 3100 myr .",
    "we report here our first carefully reduced and analyzed high spectral resolution data taken by the irs instrument on the spitzer space telescope .",
    "this paper illustrates our method of modeling the data to obtain constraints on the gas surface density distribution and mass .",
    "we eventually plan to obtain data on about 40 nearby stars in this age range to look for variation with age and other stellar properties .",
    "the data presented here are for the source hd  105 , a @xmath1 myr old g0 star at a distance of 40 pc with a known ir excess arising from a circumstellar dust disk orbiting at @xmath107 au .",
    "the derived upper limits to the h@xmath3 s(0 ) 28 @xmath4 m , h@xmath3 s(1 ) 17 @xmath4 m , h@xmath3 s(2 ) 12 @xmath4 m , [ si ] 25 @xmath4 m , [ feii ] 26 @xmath4 m , and [ siii ] 35 @xmath4 m lines are given in table 1 .",
    "the h@xmath3 upper limits directly place limits on the mass of warm gas in the disk : @xmath108 m@xmath8 at 50 k , @xmath109 m@xmath8 at 100 k , and 3.0@xmath110 m@xmath8 at 200 k. this can be compared with the roughly 10@xmath111 m@xmath8 of gas detected around @xmath39 pictoris , a 10 - 20 myr old a5 star at a distance of about 19 pc ( brandeker et al 2004 ) .",
    "it can also be compared with the recent uv absorption measurements and analysis of au mic , an m1 star in the @xmath39 pictoris moving group at a distance of 9.9 pc and with a similar age as @xmath39 pic ( roberge et al 2005 ) .",
    "they find an upper limit to the h@xmath3 mass of about @xmath112 m@xmath8 .",
    "it appears that even in the inner ( @xmath113 au ) regions not well probed by co observations , the gas is largely dissipated in these three sources which span the age range 10 - 30 myr , and which span the stellar types from m1 to a5 .",
    "detailed thermal / chemical models of hd  105 were constructed and compared with the spitzer observations to obtain further constraints on the gas mass and surface density .",
    "these models calculate the gas temperature , chemistry , and vertical structure self - consistently and predict line fluxes which depend largely on the gas inner radius , @xmath10 , and the gas surface density @xmath77 there .",
    "we show that most of the gas emission arises in a thin inner rim , extending from @xmath10 to @xmath114 , heated by stellar optical , ultraviolet , and x - ray photons .",
    "the upper limits on the [ si ] 25 @xmath4 m and [ siii ] 35 @xmath4 m fine structure lines provide the strongest constraints on the gas surface density @xmath77 at the inner rim .",
    "if the gas inner radius is comparable to the observationally constrained dust inner radius , @xmath107 au , we show that the spitzer upper limits on the line fluxes limit @xmath77 to @xmath115 gm @xmath12 for @xmath10 between 10 and 40 au . in this case , the total mass of gas ( cold and warm ) in the planet forming region between 10 and 40 au is constrained to be less than 0.1 m@xmath8 ( assuming a constant surface density between @xmath10 and 40 au ) .    the gas may not co - exist with the dust , however .",
    "we show that even if the putative gas extends inward to @xmath13 au , the spitzer upper limits set tight constraints on the gas surface density and mass .",
    "the upper limits on the gas surface density are @xmath74 = 3.43 , 0.36 , and 0.12 gm @xmath12 for @xmath10 = 0.5 , 1 , and 5 au , respectively . the total mass of gas in the gas giant planet - forming region out to 40 au depends on how we extrapolate the gas surface density from the inner radius .",
    "if we assume a gas surface density power law @xmath116 , which is often assumed in disks , then the total gas mass in these three cases is limited to about @xmath100 , 3@xmath110 , and @xmath100 m@xmath8 , respectively . an extreme assumption , allowing for the most hidden cold gas mass , would be a constant surface density with radius . in this case",
    ", we obtain total ( warm and cold ) gas mass limits of 1.9 , 0.2 , and 0.07 m@xmath8 , respectively . in summary , assuming that @xmath117 au and any reasonable gas surface density distribution , there is less than a jupiter mass of total gas in the gas giant planet forming region out to 40 au . given likely temperature distributions produced in our models , spitzer is unlikely to be able to detect _ total _ gas masses less than about 10@xmath94 m@xmath8 for disks around relatively nearby ( @xmath118 ) low mass stars .",
    "if the gas extends to @xmath119 au , the spitzer upper limits set no useful constraints on the gas mass , because gas lines become undetectable even with extremely large gas masses .",
    "in this case , the small inner rim which absorbs the heating photons from the star has too little mass ( for optically thin lines ) and too little surface area ( for optically thick lines ) to provide detectable spitzer emission , regardless of the magnitude of @xmath77 .",
    "the outer gas is effectively shielded from the heating photons , and significant cold gas mass could exist in the planet forming regions .",
    "we argue that this case is unlikely , however , since the gas would likely extend all the way to the stellar surface , and viscous accretion onto the central star would lead to observational diagnostics such as near infrared or uv excess , h@xmath65 emission , and signs of winds generated by the accretion process ( which are not observed ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the spitzer upper limits imply low upper limits to the gas surface density and mass in the 0.5 - 40 au region around hd  105 .",
    "we also note that , like hd  105 , many debris disks will have too little dust to affect the gas spectra ; therefore , a similar analysis of spitzer upper limits on line fluxes will result in similar conclusions .",
    "as discussed in  5 , the limits are not sufficiently stringent to constrain the potential effects of gas on dust dynamics .",
    "they set interesting limits on the mass of gas which might affect terrestrial planet formation only in the _ ad hoc _ case where the inner gas radius is of order 0.5  1 au .",
    "however , the limits do set interesting constraints for giant planet formation .",
    "the upper limits to the gas mass obtained here are too small to enhance the buildup of gas poor outer giants such as uranus or neptune , and too small to allow for gas giants to form from the gas reservoir after this time ( @xmath120 myr ) .",
    "we acknowledge support from nasa s spitzer space telescope legacy program , which has supported our group , the formation and evolution of planetary systems legacy team .",
    "we thank the rest of the feps team for their efforts in making the feps project successful , and for their help in obtaining , analyzing , and interpreting the data discussed in this paper .",
