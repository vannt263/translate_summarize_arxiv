    "hh 34 is one of the hh objects in herbig s catalogue ( herbig 1974 ) .",
    "it jumped into the limelight with the paper of reipurth et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , who showed that the hh object ( hh 34s ) had a bow shaped morphology , and a jet - like association of aligned knots ( pointing towards the apex of the bow shock ) .",
    "later observations showed the existence of a northern counterpart to hh 34s ( hh34n ) and of a series of bipolar bow shock pairs at larger distances from the outflow source ( bally & devine 1994 ; eislffel & mundt 1997 ; devine et al .",
    "there is a wealth of observations of this outflow , including images , spectrophotometry , radial velocity and proper motion measurements at optical ( see , e. g. , heathcote & reipurth 1992 ; eislffel & mundt 1992 ; morse et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ; reipurth et al . 2002 ; beck et al . 2007 ) and ir wavelemgths ( stapelfeldt et al . 1991",
    "; stanke et al . 1998 ; reipurth et al .",
    "these observations show that the hh  34 outflow ( at a distance of @xmath3  pc , see menten et al .",
    "2007 ) has a plane of the sky velocity of @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 and propagates at an angle of @xmath6 from the plane of the sky ( the southern lobe being directed towards the observer ) .",
    "the flow itself is driven by hh 34 irs , a class i protostar surrounded by a relatively large ( @xmath7 au radius ) circumstellar disk ( stapelfeldt & scoville 1993 ; anglada et al .",
    "the possible coupling of the disk and outflow has motivated the search for signatures of internal rotation within the jet as consequence of the transfer of angular momentum from the rotating disk into the highly collimated jet ( coffey et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in spite of the clear bipolar symmetry of the bow shock pairs ( extending to @xmath8 pc from the source ,",
    "see devine et al .",
    "1997 ) , observations extending over @xmath9 decades did not detect a nothern counterpart for the chain of aligned knots extending @xmath10 southwards from the hh 34 source .",
    "this situation changed with the paper of garca lpez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who obtained ir ( 1.6 and 2.1 @xmath11 m ) long - slit spectra in which the emission of the northern counter - jet was finally detected .",
    "these authors note that the emission of the counterjet has intensity peaks at positions ( i. e. , distances from the source ) which approximately coincide with the knots along the southern jet .    in this paper , we present new spitzer irac images of hh 34 .",
    "these images show the southern jet and northern counterjets with comparable intensities , and with a surprising degree of symmetry .",
    "the observations are described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we present an image of the central region of the hh 34 outflow , quantitatively evaluate the degree of symmetry between the jet and the counterjet , and discuss the implications of the results for the ejection mechanism that has produced the outflow .",
    "the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the observations of hh 34 are part of our original spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) general observer ( go ) program 3315 ( pi noriega - crespo ) obtained with both the infrared camera irac ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) and the infrared photometer mips ( rieke et al . 2004 ) in march 28 , 2005 .",
    "the data have been recovered from the spitzer legacy archive and the quality of the final images ( post basic calibrated data or post - bcd ; s18.7 products ) is outstanding , so that no further processing was required . in this study",
    "we present the irac observations obtained in the four channels ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) = ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 & 8.0 ) covering a fov of @xmath12   ( the result of a 6@xmath136 array map with a 260  stepsize ) and with a total integration time per pixel of 30 sec . the final images are sampled with 0.6  per pixel , nearly one third of standard @xmath9  irac angular resolution .",
    "figure 1 shows a three color image of hh 34 using channels 1 , 2 and 3 . like with other protostellar outflows",
    "observed with irac ( see e.g. noriega - crespo et al .",
    "2004 ; looney , tobin & kwon 2007 ; tobin et al . 2007 ;",
    "ybarra & lada 2009 ) channel 2 recovers the strongest jet emission , since its bandpass ( 4 to 5 ) includes three relatively bright pure rotational h@xmath14 emission lines , 0 - 0 s(9 ) 4.69 , 0 - 0 s(10 ) 4.41 and 0 - 0 s(11 ) 4.18 ; the jet is well detected in channel 3 as well , where another couple of h@xmath14 lines are found ( 0 - 0 s(6 ) 6.11 and 0 - 0 s(7 ) 5.51 ) ( see de buizer & vacca 2010 ) .",
    "in figure 2 , we show the 4.5 + 5.8  image of the region around the source of hh  34 , rotated so that the outflow axis is parallel to the ordinate .",
    "this image shows a surprising symmetry between the southern jet ( detected in optical images ) and the northern counterjet . we have defined a 7 pixel ( @xmath15 ) wide , recangular box aligned with the hh  34 axis , within which we subtract the background emission ( defined as a linear interpolation between the pixels immediately outside of the long edges of the box ) .",
    "the result of this background emission subtraction is shown on the right hand side of figure 2 , in which the knot structure along the hh 34 jet and counterjet is seen more clearly .",
    "we have carried out paraboloidal fits to the emission peaks of the knots along the outflow axis , determining the positions of the peaks with an error of @xmath16 pix .",
    "@xmath17 . through this procedure",
    ", we obtain the positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the 7 knots along the jet and the counterjet ( respectively ) .",
    "the position of the source is not so well determined , because the image of the source is partially saturated , and has a complex point spread function .",
    "because of this , we have estimated the position of the source as the average of the coordinates of the seven knots along the jet and the counterjet . a paraboloidal fit to the emission of the region around the source actually results in a similar position ( with offsets of @xmath20 pix along and @xmath21 pix across the jet axis with respect to the average position of the ensemble of knots ) .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot the positions @xmath19 of the consecutive knots along the counterjet as a function of the positions @xmath18 of the corresponding knots along the jet .",
    "this figure shows the remarkable symmetry ( with respect to the position of the source ) of the knots along the jet and the counterjet .    in figure 3",
    ", we also plot the offsets @xmath22 ( between the positions of the corresponding jet / counterjet knot pairs ) as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "the first three knots have monotonically growing offsets , with @xmath23 ( ranging from @xmath24 times the measurement error , see above ) .",
    "the four knots further away from the source generally have larger offsets , with a top value @xmath25 for the 6th knot out from the source .",
    "the resulting @xmath26 vs. @xmath18 dependence therefore has low offsets close to the source , and increasingly large ( and more highly oscillating ) values for larger distances from the source .",
    "these results can be interpreted as follows .",
    "let us first assume that the jet / counterjet knot pairs are ejected at the same time @xmath27 , but with different velocities @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( for the jet and counterjet knots , respectively ) . if the knots are ballistic , at a time @xmath30 they will have positions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "one then obtains that the jet / counterjet knot offset @xmath33 ( due to asymmetries in the jet / counterjet ejection velocities ) is given by  : @xmath34 in other words , an ejection velocity asymmetry in the simultaneous ejection of a jet / counterjet knot pair results in a knot position asymmetry @xmath33 that increases linearly with distance from the source ( as the knots travel away from the source ) .",
    "let us now assume that we have a pair of knots ejected with the same velocity @xmath28 , but at times @xmath27 and @xmath35 ( for the knot along the jet and the counterjet , respectively ) . for ballistic knots , at a time",
    "@xmath30 they would then be at distances @xmath31 and @xmath36 from the source .",
    "the jet / counterjet knot offset @xmath37 ( due to a time - defference @xmath38 in the ejection time ) is given by  : @xmath39 in other words , the position asymmetry @xmath37 does not change as the knots travel away from the source along the jet and counterjet .    for the case of jet / counterjet knot pairs ejected with a time difference @xmath38 and a velocity difference",
    "@xmath40 , we therefore predict an asymmetry between the jet and counterjet knot positions of the form @xmath41 this relation gives the behaviour of @xmath26 as a function of distance from the source @xmath18 ( along the jet ) for a given pair of knots as they travel down the jet / counterjet axis .    if we have a series of knot pairs ( 7 knot pairs in our hh  34 image ) , the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 will not necessarily be identical for all of the knot pairs .",
    "we can anyway attempt to fit a linear @xmath26 vs. @xmath18 dependence to the observations",
    ".    at large enough distances from the source , equation ( [ dx ] ) is a straight line which goes through the origin ( of the @xmath26 vs. @xmath18 coordinates ) , with a slope of @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath43 term ( see equation [ dx ] ) results in a scatter of points above and below ( depending on the sign of @xmath38 this straight line .",
    "this scatter will also have a contribution from the distribution of the @xmath44 values over the knot pairs .",
    "therefore , if we have a distribution of @xmath38 ( over the different knot pairs ) with a zero mean velocity ( i.  e. , with similar positive and negative @xmath38 values ) , we would expect to recover from the data a straight line that still goes through the origin .",
    "the slope of this line would represent an average of @xmath44 over the ensemble of knot pairs ( see equation [ dx ] ) .",
    "the value of the determined error for the @xmath45 interception point of the straight line would give us an upper limit to the root mean square average of @xmath43 .",
    "fitting a least squares linear dependence to the observed offsets , we obtain @xmath46 we therefore obtain an estimate for the average time offset of basically 0 ( as expected ) , an upper limit for its root mean square value of @xmath47 , and a velocity asymmetry with an average modulus of approximately @xmath48 .",
    "if we consider a distance of 417  pc ( to hh  34 ) and that the knots have a plane of the sky velocity @xmath49  km  s@xmath5 , we then obtain @xmath50    the maximum value of @xmath38 that we have determined in this way from the observed jet / counterjet asymmetry of hh  34 directly implies a maximum possible size for the region in which the ejection is produced .",
    "the gas at the foot of a stellar jet is observed to have temperatures of @xmath51  k , implying a sound speed of @xmath52  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the alvn velocity in this region is expected to have similar values . in order to synchronize the jet / counterjet ejections to a time @xmath38 , the region producing both outflows has to be able to communicate causally within this time interval .",
    "therefore , waves propagating at a velocity @xmath53 ( this could be the alfvn or the sound velocity , both @xmath54  km  s@xmath5 , see above ) should be able to travel the characteristic size @xmath55 of the jet formation region within a time @xmath38 . this condition can be written as  : @xmath56 where for the second inequality we have used the value of @xmath38 derived from the observed hh  34 jet / counterjet asymmetry ( see equation [ fit2 ] ) and the estimated sound speed of 3  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we have obtained irac images of the region around the source of the hh  34 outflow ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these images show the presence of a southern jet and a northern counterjet ( previously only detected in the ir long - slit spectrum presented by garca lpez et al .",
    "the seven knots along the jet and the counterjet have a remarkable symmetry with respect to the position of the outflow source ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we find that if we plot the offsets @xmath22 ( where @xmath18 is the distance from the source of a knot along the jet and @xmath19 the distance to the corresponding knot along the counterjet ) as a function of the position @xmath18 of the knots , we obtain a general trend of lager @xmath26 values for increasing distances from the source ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this trend can be interpreted ( on the basis of a simple , ballistic knot model ) as the result of a time - offset @xmath38 ( between the ejection of the two knots in a given pair ) and of a velocity difference @xmath40 ( between the velocities of the knot pair ) .    from a fit to the observed @xmath26 vs. @xmath57 relationship , we determine a velocity asymmetry of @xmath58  km  s@xmath5 , and an upper limit for the time - offset of the binary ejection of @xmath59  yr .",
    "interestingly , the velocity asymmetry estimated for the binary ejections is within a factor of @xmath9 of the estimates for the sound and alfvn speeds at the base of an outflow from a young star . actually , the estimates of the sound and alfvn speeds lie within the error bars of the @xmath40 value determined from the hh 34 jet / counterjet knot asymmetries .",
    "it is possible to use the upper limit of @xmath60  yr to derive an estimate @xmath61  au for the size of the jet production region .",
    "for example , if one considers models of magnetocentrifugally driven disk winds , this estimate would imply a characteristic radius for the alfvn surface ( in which the outflow becomes super - alfvnic ) of @xmath62  au .",
    "this is an interesting constraint on models of the production of jets from young stars ( for a recent discussion of jet production models see the review of ferreira 2008 , and the papers in the book of garca & ferreira 2010 ) .",
    "another possible interpretation is that the @xmath63  au radius ( derived from the observations ) corresponds to the outer radius of the region of the accretion disk which gives rise to the jet .",
    "this interpretation might be more comfortable in terms of magnetocentrifugally driven disk winds , because an alfvn surface of @xmath0  au radius might be too small .",
    "vla observations of sources of hh outflows had provided a constraint of a maximum size of @xmath64  au ( @xmath65 at the distance of orion ) on the size of the jet production region ( see , e.  g. , the hh  1/2 observations of rodrguez et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath66  au that we have derived above for the size of the formation region of the hh  34 jet is therefore the most stringent condition yet .",
    "this size corresponds to @xmath67  mas , a resolution that will only be approached in direct observations of an hh source by future efforts with the alma interferometer .",
    "observations with large baseline near - ir interferometers ( such as keck - i or vlt - i ) could possibly also resolve such a region , provided that the emission is strong enough to be detected .    to conclude ,",
    "we should point out that the derived upper limit of @xmath66  au for the jet formation region is derived from a simple , ballistic approximation for the motion of the knots along the hh 34 jet and counterjet .",
    "of course , the observed asymmetry could partially arise from deviations from a purely ballistic motion .",
    "if this is the case , the size implied for the jet formation region would be even smaller .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "the work of ar and vl was supported by the conacyt grants 61547 , 101356 and 101975 ."
