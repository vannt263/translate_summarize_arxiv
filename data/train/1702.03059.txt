    "we consider the following additive gaussian channel with feedback @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the message to be communicated through the channel , the noise @xmath4 , which is independent of @xmath3 , is a zero mean stationary gaussian process , and @xmath5 , the channel input at time @xmath6 , may depend on @xmath3 and previous channel outputs @xmath7 .",
    "and we assume the channel input @xmath8 satisfies the following average power constraint : there is @xmath9 such that for all @xmath10 , @xmath11 \\le p.\\ ] ] let @xmath12 denote the capacity of the channel ( [ gc ] ) , which is often referred to as _ gaussian feedback capacity _ in the literature .",
    "it is well known that the _ non - feedback capacity _ of ( [ gc ] ) can be obtained through the power spectral density water - filling method  @xcite . as a matter of fact , when the channel noise is white ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath4 is i.i.d . ) , shannon  @xcite showed that feedback does not increase capacity , which means , like its non - feedback counterpart , the feedback capacity features an explicit and simple formula . here",
    "we note that in  @xcite ,  @xcite , kadota , zakai and ziv also proved this statement for continuous - time white gaussian channels . on the other hand",
    "though , if the channel is not white , feedback may increase capacity ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , and little has been known about its feedback capacity despite a number of papers  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite relating the two capacities .",
    "computing @xmath12 has been a long - standing open problem that is of fundamental importance in information theory .",
    "an prominent approach to tackle gaussian feedback capacity can be found in a pioneering work  @xcite , where cover and pombra characterized the capacity through the sequence of the so - called `` @xmath10-block feedback capacity '' : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 stand for the covariance matrices of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "it is also shown that the maximization can be taken over @xmath17 of the special form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a strictly lower - triangular @xmath22 matrix and the gaussian vector @xmath23 is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "so , ( [ n - block-0 ] ) can be rewriten as @xmath24 subject to the constraint @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a non - negative definite @xmath22 matrix .",
    "then , using the asymptotic equipartition property for arbitrary ( non - stationary non - ergodic ) gaussian processes , a coding theorem can then be proved to characterize the gaussian feedback capacity as the limiting expression below : @xmath27 though considerable efforts have been devoted to follow up the cover - pombra formulation , a `` computable '' formula for the gaussian feedback capacity does not seem to be within sight : it is already difficult to find the sequence of the optimal @xmath28 acheiving @xmath29 , and its limiting behavior seems to be as evasive .",
    "another prominent approach came along in a recent work of kim  @xcite , which led to a number of breakthroughs deepening our understanding of gaussian feedback capacity . roughly speaking , instead of examining the channel ( [ gc ] ) over a finite time window ,",
    "kim justifies certain interchanges between limits and integrals when evaluating ( [ n - block ] ) and ( [ limitnblock ] ) and recast the problem of computing @xmath12 as an infinite - dimensional optimization problem .",
    "below , we state one of the theorems in  @xcite that is relevant to our results .",
    "[ theorem1 ] suppose that the power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath30 of the gaussian noise process @xmath31 is bounded away from 0 , and has a canonical spectral factorization @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "then the feedback capacity @xmath12 is given by @xmath34 where the maximum is taken over all strictly causal @xmath35 satisfying the power constraint @xmath36 furthermore , a filter @xmath37 attains the maximum in ( [ starting - point1 ] ) if and only if    1 .",
    "power : @xmath38 2 .   output spectrum : @xmath39 3 .",
    "strong orthogonality : for some @xmath40 @xmath41 is causal .",
    "using theorem  [ theorem1 ] and relevant tools from the theory of hardy spaces  @xcite , kim further characterized the capacity achieving @xmath42 for the special case that @xmath4 is a @xmath0-th order autoregressive moving average ( arma(@xmath0 ) ) gaussian process . roughly speaking",
    ", the following theorem says that the optimal @xmath43 must be rational satisfying three conditions corresponding to those in theorem  [ theorem1 ] .",
    "here we note that following the notational convention in  @xcite , we use @xmath42 and @xmath44 ( and the like ) interchangeably , and when there is no risk of confusion , we may even suppress the notational dependence on @xmath45 or @xmath46 for simplicity .",
    "[ theorem2 ] suppose the noise @xmath4 is not white and is an arma(@xmath0 ) gaussian process with parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , namely , it has the power spectral density @xmath51 then the feedback capacity @xmath12 in ( [ starting - point1 ] ) is necessarily achieved by a filter @xmath43 of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a stable polynomial whose degree is at most @xmath0 , and @xmath54 is a normalized blaschke product of at most @xmath0 zeros .",

    "then , the gaussian feedback capacity is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unique root of the following fourth - order polynomial @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69    we now digress a bit to briefly mention related results on the arma(@xmath61 ) gaussian feedback capacity in the literature : generalizing the celebrated schalkwijk - kailath scheme  @xcite ,  @xcite , butman  @xcite obtained a lower bound of the feedback capacity of ar(@xmath61 ) channel ( a special arma(@xmath61 ) channel with @xmath70 ) .",
    "butman s bound was shown to be optimal under some cases of linear feedback schemes by wolfowitz  @xcite and tiernan  @xcite .",
    "tiernan and schalkwijk  @xcite also found an upper bound of ar(@xmath61 ) gaussian channel capacity , which is equal to butman s lower bound at very low and very high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that butman s lower bound is indeed the capacity , and the capacity of ma(@xmath61 ) channel ( a special arma(@xmath61 ) channel with @xmath71 ) was also derived in the same paper .",
    "more recently , yang , kavi and tatikonda  @xcite studied the arma(@xmath0 ) gaussian channel by analyzing the structure of the optimal input distribution and reformulating the problem as a stochastic control optimization problem . and",
    "based on a speculation of the limiting behavior of the optimal input distribution , they derived the formula ( [ arma1-xx ] ) and conjectured that it gives the arma(@xmath61 ) gaussian feedback capacity .    as mentioned above",
    ", the power of the variational formulation as in theorem  [ theorem1 ] has been showcased in theorem  [ arma1-theorem ] , where the conjecture of  @xcite has been confirmed and the arma(@xmath61 ) gaussian feedback capacity is given as an explicit and simple formula . to the best of our knowledge , the arma(@xmath61 ) gaussian feedback channel is the only non - trivial scenario whose gaussian feedback capacity is `` computable '' .",
    "the success by the variational formulation approach , contrasted by all the above - mentioned other approaches that have been struggling dealing with special cases of an arma(@xmath61 ) channel , naturally posed the question of whether it can be extended to deal with more general channels , for instance , arma(@xmath0 ) gaussian feedback channels .",
    "attempts in this direction , however , have somehow encountered certain technical barriers , due to the fact that the form in ( [ filterb ] ) is `` less manageable '' ( see page @xmath72 in  @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , instead of following the variational formulation framework , an alternative state - space representation approach has been proposed in  @xcite to deal with the arma(@xmath0 ) gaussian feedback capacity , only to yield an intractable optimization problem ( see theorem @xmath73 in  @xcite ) . here",
    "we remark that prior to  @xcite , a result of similar nature has also been derived in theorem @xmath74 of  @xcite , which however appears to be at least as uncanny .    in this paper",
