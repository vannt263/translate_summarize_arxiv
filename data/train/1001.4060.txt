    "constraint satisfaction problems ( csps ) , which are highly relevant to many applications such as electronic circuit design and frequency assignment in cellular mobile networks , have been studied in the fields of applied mathematics , computer science and engineering . despite their usefulness ,",
    "many csps are np - complete problems @xcite associated with algorithmic hardness .",
    "it is thus important to understand the physical origin of their hardness and map out the easy and hard regimes for typical instances .",
    "physicists approach the problem by making analogy between csps and spin glasses @xcite .",
    "objective functions are mapped to spin glass hamiltonians , enabling the analysis of csps using statistical physical techniques .",
    "successful examples are found in the @xmath0-satisfiability problem @xcite , graph coloring @xcite , and vertex cover @xcite .",
    "they suggest a rich physical picture of csps corresponding to the glassy phase in spin glasses .",
    "in this paper we study a problem having a wide range of applications and sharing the characteristics of csps . specifically , we consider the optimal locations of source nodes in transportation networks .",
    "transportation networks consist of nodes with either surplus or deficiency of resources , and an important problem is to distribute them so as to achieve a networkwide satisfaction with a minimum transportation cost @xcite .",
    "this problem is important in load balancing in computer networks @xcite and network flow of commodities @xcite .",
    "progress has been made in generalizing the message - passing technique of discrete variables to the passing of cavity energy functions in terms of the continuous current variables @xcite .",
    "subsequent work considered networks in which shortages are allowed but cost penalty is imposed @xcite .",
    "this models applications such as communications networks where shortages are detrimental to the performance of the nodes .",
    "their effects were modeled by step - like shortage costs .",
    "this high nonlinearity gives rise to unique behavior and a physical picture absent in the previous models .",
    "when the shortage cost is comparable to the transportation cost , the total cost may be optimized either by saving the transportation cost feeding a poor node while sacrificing the satisfaction of the node , or by saving the shortage cost while spending more on the transportation cost .",
    "the picture in reminiscent of the learning of noisy examples in perceptrons , where the field distribution of the examples consist of the bands , corresponding to the learned and sacrificed examples respectively @xcite . as a result ,",
    "frustration arises from competition for resources among connected nodes .",
    "numerous metastable states emerge , leading to typical glassy behavior .    the problem of optimal source location in this paper addresses an even more general and practically relevant issue in network design and optimization .",
    "compared with @xcite where some nodes remain unsatisfied in the optimized state , this paper moves one step forward and considers the situation in which the _ location _ of the source nodes can also be optimized , and all nodes are satisfied .",
    "the source location problem has wide applications in the design of optimized transportation networks .",
    "for example , the optimal locations of access points in wireless networks can be determined by balancing the signaling cost of the access points and the power and bandwidth limitations of the channels linking the mobile subscribers ( which can be expressed as the transportation cost ) .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the resource allocation problem involves passing messages of continuous variables .",
    "when the cost function includes nonlinear terms , the messages generally become extremely complicated . however , as will be described in this paper , there are phases where the space of continuous messages can be replaced by small closed sets of cavity energy functions , and their recursions can be converted to simple recursions of probabilities . in the context of the source location problem , this takes place when the consumer nodes form small clusters surrounded by source nodes . when the ratio of the installation cost of the source nodes and the transportation cost changes , regimes with different maximum cluster sizes are observed , resembling the devil s staircase observed in the circle map and other dynamical systems @xcite",
    ". we will show that the use of small closed sets of cavity energy functions is particularly successful in the _ singlet _ regime where the consumer nodes are isolated ( clusters of size 1 ) and , when the cost ratio is commensurate , in the _ doublet _ regime where the consumer nodes can be paired or isolated .",
    "in fact , clusters formed by similar energetic considerations have been found to play an important role in disordered systems such as the random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gr_rfim ] .",
    "indeed , domain sizes in rfim are determined by the interplay between the random field energy and the domain wall energy , giving rise to the so - called griffiths singularities and cascades of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "analogously , cluster sizes in the source location problem are determined by the balanced between the installation cost of the source nodes and the transportation costs .",
    "another class of problems that exhibits similar cluster behaviors is the lattice glass models  @xcite . in the lattice glass models , each site of a network",
    "can be occupied or empty , but the number of nearest neighbors can not exceed a maximum .",
    "analogously , the energetics of cluster formation in the source location problem implies that two neighboring consumer nodes have effective repulsions , since their contiguity prevents them from drawing resources from more neighboring source nodes .",
    "however , the present model is richer in behavior , since the cluster energy depends on the current distribution in non - trivial ways , rather than merely counting the number of neighbors . when the particle density in a lattice glass increases , configurations of clusters are formed , causing the system to undergo dynamical freezing transitions preceding the ideal glass transition .",
    "similar transitions will be reported in the source location problem .    the vertex cover problem @xcite , one of the np - complete problems in computational complexity theory @xcite that attracted recent attention from physicists , also shares similar cluster behaviors . drawing the analogy of assigning guards in a museum @xcite , each site of a network",
    "can be covered or uncovered , but none of the links can have both vertices uncovered .",
    "hence the uncovered nodes form a configuration with an effective repulsion among them . indeed",
    ", an equivalent configuration of consumer nodes can be found in the singlet regime of the source location problem , since for neighboring consumer nodes , each has one less link to draw resources from the neighboring source nodes .",
    "when the average connectivity of the network increases , we will show that it undergoes a glassy transition analogous to that in the vertex cover problem .",
    "the origin of these interesting phenomena can be traced to the presence of _ frustrations _ , which refer to the conflicts between competing interaction energies in the system @xcite .",
    "this connects our problem with a broad class of network csps in which frustrations are inherent .",
    "when the system consists of numerous states , the replica symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) solution is applicable , but the distribution of the cavity energy functions is in general infeasible to solve .",
    "nevertheless , with the small closed set of cavity energy functions introduced in this paper , the one - step rsb ( 1rsb ) solution becomes computationally feasible .",
    "the physical results based on the replica symmetric ( rs ) ansatz and the 1rsb configurational entropy are thus derived .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce our problem in section [ sec_model ] , presenting simulation results of the optimal behaviors . in section [ sec_rs ]",
    ", we discuss the general rs formalism and derive the piecewise quadratic ansatz of the cavity energy functions . in section [ sec_rsresult ] , we obtain a small closed set of cavity energy functions in the singlet regime and demonstrate how functional recursions are converted to recursions of probabilities . the average energy , the fraction of soft nodes and the rs - rsb phase diagram are derived . in section [ sec_rsb ] , we apply the small closed set of cavity fields to the 1rsb formalism and obtain results of the configurational entropy .",
    "the conclusion is given in section [ sec_conclusion ] . in [ sec_closesetdoublesat ] , we describe how the small closed set of cavity energy functions can be applied to the doublet regime in the commensurate case , and the corresponding rs and 1rsb results are derived .",

    "each node @xmath3 is connected randomly to a set @xmath4 of @xmath0 neighbors .",
    "each node @xmath3 has _ capacity _ @xmath5 ; nodes with positive and negative values of @xmath5 correspond to _ surplus _ and _ deficient _ nodes respectively .",

    ", we consider a bimodal distribution in which @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 and @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 .",
    "naturally , the surplus nodes serve as _ source nodes _ providing resources to the _ consumer nodes_. however , to minimize cost functions that include transportation costs , it is often desirable to convert some deficient nodes into source nodes as well . hence in general , the task is to optimally locate these _ extra _ source nodes so as to minimize the total cost function . the relevant glossary used in this paper",
