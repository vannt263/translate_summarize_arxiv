    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory was launched on july 23 1999 , carrying on board a revolutionary high resolution mirror assembly , with a point spread function of 0.5 arcsec ( half power radius ) over the broad 0.1 to 10 kev band ( van speybroeck , et al .",
    "this , together with the aspect camera which at the moment provides attitude solutions with errors of the order of 1 - 2 arcsec arcsec and the source positions should be better than 1 arcsec ] , allows the study of spatial extent of x - ray sources on similar scales , i.e. smaller or similar to the size of a l@xmath2 galaxy at any redshift ; and gives x - ray source positions at least as good as 23 arcsec , immediately allowing the unambiguous identification of the optical counterparts of faint x - ray sources .",
    "consequently , the determination of the source redshifts via optical spectroscopy becomes highly efficient .",
    "the improvement provided by _",
    "chandra _ is especially significant in the hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray band .",
    "surveys of the hard x - ray sky have been performed in the past by asca and bepposax ( ueda et al .",
    "1998 , della ceca et al . 1999 ,",
    "fiore et al",

    "2000 , comastri et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the large error boxes ( 1 - 2 arcmin ) limited the optical identification process to classes of objects with low surface density , at a given optical magnitude limit . as a result ,",
    "most of the identified sources are emission line agn ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 , akiyama et al .",
    "2000 , and la franca et al . in preparation ) .",
    "about 30 % of the bepposax hellas survey sources studied spectroscopically down to r=20.5 have escaped a secure identification ( fiore et al .",
    "2000b , la franca et al . in preparation ) , although many normal galaxies and stars have been observed in these error - boxes .",
    "_ chandra _ s unprecedented capabilities make identifications unambiguous , and open up the possibility of searching for and studying classes of sources not previously recognized as strong hard x - ray emitters , and of assessing their contribution to the hard x - ray cosmic background ( xrb ; e.g. griffiths & padovani 1990 )",
    ". in particular , it will be possible for the first time to begin studying normal galaxies at @xmath3 , as well as possible `` minority '' hard x - ray source populations ( kim & elvis 1999 ) .",
    "we have started a pilot project of spectroscopic identification of _ chandra _ sources in two medium  deep fields that were visible from la silla in january 2000 , with the aim of verifying the feasibility of such studies with 4 m class telescopes .",
    "the results on 10 x - ray sources are very encouraging and are described in the following .",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory consists of four pairs of concentric wolter i mirrors reflecting 0.1 - 10 kev x - rays into one of the four focal plane detectors : acis - i , acis - s , hrc - i or hrc - s ( weisskopf , odell & vanspeybroeck 1996 ) .",
    "all the results presented in the following were obtained with the @xmath4 acis - i ccd instrument .",
    "table 1 gives the log of the chandra observations .",
    "one field is centered on the @xmath1=0.6 quasar pks0312@xmath577 , the other is located @xmath6 away from the radiant point of the leonid meteor shower .",
    "level 2 processed data ( fabbiano et al . in preparation ) were obtained from the chandra public archive .",
    "data were cleaned and analyzed using the ciao software ( release v1.1 , elvis et al . in preparation ) .",
    "time intervals with large background rate were removed , as well as hot pixels and bad columns . only the standard event grades ( 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 ) were used .",
    "sources were detected in images accumulated in the 210 kev band ( channels 136 - 680 ) .",
    "robust sliding - cell algorithms were used to locate the sources .",
    "we used both the @xmath7 program available in the cxc data analysis package ciao ( dobrzycki et al .",
    "1999 ) and a variation of the detect routine included in the ximage package ( giommi et al .",
    "the method consists in first convolving the x - ray image with a wavelet function , in order to smooth the image and increase contrast , and then running a standard sliding cell detection method on the smoothed image .",
    "the quality of each detection was checked interactively .",
    "final net counts are estimated from the original ( un  smoothed ) image , to preserve poisson statistics .",
    "a binning factor of 2 ( i.e. pixels of @xmath8 1 arcsec ) and source box sizes of 6 arcsec ( offaxis angle @xmath9 ) , 10 arcsec ( @xmath10 offaxis angle @xmath11 ) and 30 arcsec ( offaxis angle @xmath12 ) maximize the signal to noise ratio , given the local background , psf and source intensity .",
    "the background is calculated using source - free boxes near the sources .",
    "this is usually very low in the 210 kev band , i.e. 0.150.3 counts per 6 arcsec detection box side , per 10 ks .    for this study",
    "only sources with more than 10 , 15 and 40 counts in the 6 arcsec , 10 arcsec and 30 arcsec detection cells respectively , are considered .",
    "given a conservative background of 0.6 , 1.5 and 15 counts in the detection cells this corresponds to a poisson probability for a background fluctuation of @xmath13 in all cases .",
    "the total number of detection cells can be estimated in about 7800 6@xmath14 cells plus 5000 10@xmath14 cells plus a few tens of 30@xmath14 cells in each observation ( 4 acis - i chips ) .",
    "therefore , the total number of spurious sources in the two fields ( 0.14 deg@xmath15 ) at the chosen detection thresholds is absolutely negligible ( 10@xmath16 ) .",
    "thirteen sources detected in the 210 kev images passed these thresholds .",
    "all but one are also detected in the softer 0.52 kev band ( the non  detected source has about 6 counts in the soft band ) .",
    "count rates were corrected for the psf and the telescope vignetting calculated at 4.5 kev ( 210 kev band ) and 1.5 kev ( 0.52 kev band ) using figures 3.8 and 3.10 of the axaf observatory guide ( 1997 ) .",
    "the correction is about 25 % at an off - axis angle of 12 arcmin and 10 % at 6 arcmin .",
    "fluxes in the 210 kev band were computed assuming a count rate to flux conversion factor of @xmath17 per count s@xmath18 .",
    "fluxes in the 0.52 kev were computed assuming factors of @xmath19 and @xmath20per count s@xmath18 for leonid anti - rad and the pks0312@xmath5770 fields respectively .",
    "these conversion factors are appropriate for power law models with @xmath21 ( 210 kev ) and @xmath22 ( 0.52 kev ) respectively , assuming the galactic absorbing column densities quoted in table 1 .",
    "table 2 gives for the thirteen detected sources the x - ray position and off - axis angle , the 210 kev and 0.52 kev counts ( corrected for the psf and the vignetting ) and the corresponding fluxes .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "optical counterparts were found in the usno catalogue down to r@xmath23 in ten cases , in the dss2 e(r ) images in two cases ( lar1 and lar3 ) , and on efosc2 r band image in the last case ( p4 ) .",
    "optical counterparts were found for 11 sources with a typical displacement of @xmath24 arcsec . in one case ( lar4 )",
    "the displacement is of 4  .",
    "we consider the identification secure because a ) lar4 is observed by acis at an offaxis angle of 12 arcmin , where the psf is highly asymmetric and broader than 10 arcsec , making the x - ray position more uncertain , and b ) the optical source is a bright , broad line quasar , the surface density of which is so low that the probability to find one by chance at @xmath25 from an x - ray source is negligible .",
    "in fact , the probability of finding _ any _ r@xmath2622 galaxy in a @xmath25 radius error - box by chance is @xmath27 0.04 , while the same probability for an agn is at least ten times smaller . therefore the number of agn misidentifications in our sample is @xmath28 .",
    "the number of expected galaxy misidentifications at r@xmath2620 is @xmath27 0.2 , while that of r@xmath2622 is @xmath27 0.5 . in one case ( lar2 )",
    "no optical counterpart brighter than r @xmath8 20 is present in the x  ray error box .",
    "however a r=18 galaxy , with an optical extension of about 3 arcsec , is present at 6 arcsec from the x - ray position .",
    "therefore the galaxy outskirts touch the x - ray errorbox .",
    "we conservatively consider this identification uncertain .",
    "we obtained long slit spectra of ten counterparts , using efosc2 at the eso 3.6 m telescope on january 3 - 6 2000 .",
    "spectra were obtained using grism n.6 in the 3800 - 8100 @xmath29  range and a slit 2 arcsec wide , corresponding to a resolution of 26   .",
    "the complete set of flux - calibrated spectra is shown in figure 1 .",
    "r magnitude , redshift , optical and x - ray luminosity , and a classification of the optical spectrum are given in table 2 .",
    "classification of narrow line objects is done using standard line ratio diagnostics ( e.g. osterbrook 1981 , tresse et al .",
    "1996 ) , in particular the [ oiii]@xmath30/h@xmath31 , [ sii]@xmath32/h@xmath33 and [ oiii]@xmath30/[oii]@xmath34 line ratios .",
    "we find six broad line quasars at redshift between 0.42 and 1.19 and 210 kev x ",
    "ray luminosities in the range @xmath35 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "the four remaining source identifications are as follows :    lar5 is identified with a bright @xmath1=0.016 starburst galaxy with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath36 erg s@xmath18 , similar to that of other starburst galaxies of similar optical luminosity ( ptak et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in lar6",
    ", although [ oiii ] and @xmath37 are detected , the spectrum is rather noisy and it is not clear if @xmath37 has broad wings .",
    "optical classification is therefore uncertain .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity of @xmath38 erg s@xmath18 and the x - ray softness ratio ( see below ) suggest that lar6 is an obscured agn .",
    "p3 is identified with a normal galaxy without strong emission lines ( only a weak [ oii ] line with an equivalent width of @xmath39   is apparent in the spectrum ) .",
    "the x - ray and optical luminosities are @xmath40 erg s@xmath18 and @xmath41 .",
    "the galaxy continuum is very red , suggesting an early type galaxy .",
    "the calcium break is 0.44@xmath42 , consistent with little or no dilution from non  stellar light .",
    "a faint h@xmath43 is detected in absorption ( equivalent width of @xmath44  ) .",
    "the spectrum of p4 is rather noisy because the source lies only 9 arcsec from a 10 mag star , which strongly enhances the background .",
    "we identify p4 with an agn at z=0.683 thanks to a rather strong [ oii ] and weaker [ neiii ] and mgii emission lines .",
    "the mgii to [ oii ] intensity ratio of @xmath45 is much smaller than in broad line quasars and similar to those of type 2 agn ( woltjer 1990 ) .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity of @xmath46 erg s@xmath18 and the x - ray softness ratio ( see below ) suggest that p4 is a moderately obscured quasar .",
    "we have searched the nvss , iras faint source catalog , clusters of galaxies ( aco , abell , corwin & orowin 1989 ) , normal galaxies , stars and agn catalogs , finding only one coincidence : lar5 is identified with an apm galaxy .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ telescope allows for the first time a comparison of x - ray and optical images at similar , arcsec , resolution .",
    "we have studied the spatial extent of the x - ray sources by comparing their count profiles with the _ chandra _ psf , taking into account its dependence on the off - axis angle ( as calibrated on the ground ) .",
    "the spatial extent is smaller than a few arcsec in all cases and therefore consistent with their being point sources .",
    "conversely , at least three of the optical counterparts are extended galaxies ( `` gal . '' in table 2 ) .",
    "figures 2a , b show the x - ray ( 210 kev ) contours overlaid on the optical r band images of the @xmath1=0.158 galaxy ( p3 ) and the @xmath1=0.016 starburst galaxy ( lar5 ) obtained with efosc2 .    galaxy p3 is bulge dominated , the size of the bulge being 23 arcsec .",
    "also galaxy lar5 has a bright bulge , of similar size .",
    "these sizes are similar to or smaller than the chandra psf at the offaxis angle where the sources were detected in acis - i ( 2.6 arcmin and 6 arcmin respectively ) .",
    "both galaxies are extended ( up to 1020 arcsec ) .",
    "if the x - ray emission were connected to the outer parts of the galaxy , it would have been resolved by _",
    "chandra_. both x - ray sources are centered on the galaxy nuclei .",
    "the x - ray source in lar5 appears slightly elongated in a direction perpendicular to the galaxy major axis , as seen in several nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 , dahlem et al .",
    "however , this elongation may also be due to the degradation of the _ chandra _ psf at the offaxis - angle of this source ( 6 arcmin ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the x - ray to optical flux ratios of the thirteen _ chandra _ sources as a function of the 210 kev flux , and compares them with those of local agn and of the agn found in the bepposax hellas survey .",
    "this figure shows that the x - ray to optical ratio of most _ chandra _ sources is similar to that of local and hellas agn .",
    "their optical magnitude is bright enough to allow redshift determination with 4 m or 8 m class telescopes .    at fainter fluxes figure 3",
    "shows the sources recently optically identified by mushotzky et al .",
    "r band fluxes have been computed assuming r - i=0.3 . the flux ratio of about 60% of the mushotzky et al .",
    "_ chandra _ sources is within the range of values covered by brighter agn ( i.e. log@xmath47 from @xmath52 to 1 ) .",
    "the remaining 40 % show an x - ray to optical ratio higher than that of the brighter _ chandra _ sources presented here and of the local agn ( see figure 3 ) . as discussed by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) the nature of these optically faint sources is mysterious .",
    "many of them have optical magnitude fainter than r@xmath824 which make difficult to obtain a precise redshift through optical spectroscopy .",
    "the @xmath1=0.158 normal galaxy has an x - ray to optical ratio of 0.36 , much higher than the typical value of nearby normal galaxies ( see section 5.2 ) .      for most of the _ chandra _ sources",
    "the total number of detected counts is @xmath27100 , preventing the use of proper spectral fitting procedures to study their spectrum .",
    "the broad band x - ray spectral properties can only be investigated using count ratios .",
    "if the spectrum is parameterized as an absorbed power law and the redshift of the source absorber is known , the column density can be evaluated .",
    "following fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we assume here that the x - ray absorber redshift coincides with the optical redshift .",
    "figure 4 shows the softness ratio ( s@xmath5h)/(s+h ) ( s=0.52 kev band , h=210 kev band ) of the ten spectroscopically identified _",
    "chandra _ sources as a function of the redshift .",
    "errors include counting statistics only .",
    "dashed lines show the expectation of power law models with @xmath48 absorbed by varying column densities _ in the source frame_. two of the _ chandra _ sources ( p3 and lar6 ) have a softness ratio inconsistent with that expected by an intrinsically unobscured power law at better than the 90% confidence level . in particular",
    ", lar6 is likely to be obscured by a column of @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth noting that the column densities implied by figure 4 are probably lower limits to the columns toward the nuclear hard x - ray source , because highly obscured agn usually have strong soft components ( e.g. schachter et al .",
    "1998 , maiolino et al .",
    "1998 , della ceca et al . 1999 ,",
    "fiore et al .",
    "2000a , b ) . to quantify this possible",
    "underestimate we simulated acis - i observations of three highly obscured type 2 agn ( ngc1068 , @xmath51 @xmath50 ; the circinus galaxy @xmath52 @xmath50 ; and ngc6240 , @xmath53 @xmath50 ) , based on asca and bepposax results ( matt et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 , iwasawa & comastri 1998 , vignati et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the ( s@xmath5h)/(s+h ) observed by acis - i would have been 0.88 , @xmath50.08 and 0.57 respectively .",
    "the results are strongly dependent from the sources spectral shape and redshift . at @xmath1=1 the simulated hardness ratios are 0.53 , @xmath50.30 and @xmath50.05 respectively .",
    "we also note that relatively low values of ( s@xmath5h)/(s+h ) can be produced by intrinsically flat and unobscured power laws ( for example the p3 hardness ratio of 0.16 would correspond to @xmath54 ) .",
    "efficient x - ray follow - up of relatively bright x  ray sources with xmm will provide a relatively accurate measure of the intrinsic spectrum through proper spectral fitting allowing to remove the ambiguity between an intrinsically flat spectrum and a spectrum flattened by absorption .",
    "one of the main goals of hard x - ray surveys is to investigate the origin of the hard x - ray cosmic background . the most popular model explains the xrb in terms of a mixture of obscured and unobscured agn ( setti & woltjer 1989 ) following a strong cosmological evolution .",
    "the relatively small number of sources in the present survey ( only thirteen ) , implies a @xmath55 statistical error on their number density .",
    "this limits the strength of the constraints we are able to put on agn synthesis models for the xrb . however we believe it is useful to begin addressing this issue here .    the main problem when comparing model predictions and observations is that the flux limit of _ count rate _ limited surveys depends on the actual intrinsic spectrum of the sources ( zamorani et al .",
    "harder sources would generally produce less counts ( because of the decrease of the effective area toward the higher energies ) , and therefore they would pass a detection threshold only if their flux is higher than that of softer sources with similar count rate . in order to quantify this effect we have folded a heavily absorbed ( 10@xmath56 @xmath50 ) power law spectrum ( @xmath57 = 0.8 ) with the _ chandra _ sensitivity , and computed the flux limit corresponding to the count rate threshold .",
    "this turns out to be a factor 56 higher than that of an unabsorbed power law .",
    "taking into account the column density distribution predicted by the comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) synthesis model and the _ chandra _ sensitivity , the predicted fraction of obscured ( log@xmath58 22 ) sources is 2030 % .",
    "the softness ratio results ( figure  4 ) suggest that at least 3 out of 10 optically identified sources may be absorbed by column densities equal or higher than @xmath59 @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , one of the three unidentified objects has a hard spectrum , as can be judged from the hard to soft x  ray flux ratio of table 2 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present observations are consistent with the predictions of agn synthesis models for the xrb .",
    "a surprising result from our pilot study is the detection of a luminous x - ray source in an otherwise normal galaxy ( p3 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of @xmath40 erg s@xmath18 , @xmath60 erg s@xmath18 are about a factor 30 higher than those expected on the basis of the optical luminosity ( @xmath61 ) for both spiral ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 ) and elliptical / s0 ( eskridge , fabbiano & kim 1995 ; pellegrini 1999 ) galaxies .    a few optically `` dull '' galaxies with strong x - ray emission have been reported in the past ( e.g. 3c264 and ngc4156 , elvis et al .",
    "1981 ; j2310@xmath5437 , tananbaum et al . 1997 ; griffiths et al .",
    "1996 ) and more recently in a deep _ chandra _ observation ( mushotzky et al .",
    "hard power law tails have been also discovered in a few nearby elliptical galaxies ( allen , di matteo & fabian 2000 ) . the presence of relatively strong x  ray emission in objects with no evidence of activity in the optical spectrum is still not well understood .",
    "one possibility would be a large contribution from a beamed non - thermal component in the x - ray band ( elvis et al .",
    "1981 , tananbaum et al .",
    "1997 , worrall et al . 1999 ) as for bl lacertae objects .",
    "if p3 hosts a bl lac then the non  thermal featureless optical continuum would reduce the height of the calcium break from a typical value of 0.5 found in elliptical and s0 galaxies to @xmath62 ( stocke et al .",
    "this threshold has been raised to about 0.4 by marcha and browne ( 1995 ) to take into account the spread of galaxy luminosity and sizes .",
    "the p3 calcium break of 0.44@xmath630.11 does not allow to rule out the presence of a bl lacertae object , even if it would be a rather extreme member of its class . if this is the case , the radio flux predicted from the observed x - ray flux would be in the 0.130 mjy range ( padovani & giommi 1996 ) .",
    "the pmn ( griffith et al . 1991 ) limit of about 50 mjy is not useful to settle this issue .",
    "an obscured agn could also provide a viable explanation .",
    "indeed the p3 hardness ratio implies a substantial column for a typical agn x  ray continuum .",
    "the optical emission lines could also be completely hidden except for a weak [ oii ] emission feature .",
    "it is worth remarking that examples of x  ray obscured agn with neither blr nor nlr already exist ( e.g. ngc4945 , marconi et al .",
    "2000 ; ngc6240 , vignati et al . 1999 and references therein ) , even if in these cases emission lines related to starburst emission are present .",
    "finally the presence of a low  radiative  efficiency accretion flow ( adaf ) might also be tenable .",
    "the putative central black hole mass estimated from the observed b luminosity of the galaxy s bulge following the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) relation is about 4@xmath6410@xmath65 m@xmath66 ( this is actually an upper limit , as we have assumed for the bulge luminosity that of the entire galaxy , see fig .",
    "if the x  ray emission comes from the nucleus , and it is a sizeable fraction of the bolometric luminosity , its eddington ratio is of the order of 10@xmath67 , consistent with the adaf regime ( narayan et al .",
    "an estimate of the 8.4 ghz flux has been obtained assuming the adaf spectral models calculated by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as well as the x  ray to radio flux ratios of a few adaf candidates observed at the vla ( di matteo et al .",
    "1999 ) rescaled to the p3 x  ray flux . in both cases",
    "the maximum expected radio emission is of the order of a few mjy and thus well below the present limit .",
    "the adaf contribution to the optical  uv light strongly depends on the adopted model ( see figure 2 in di matteo et al .",
    "the p3 hardness ratio is consistent with a very flat power law ( @xmath68 0.2@xmath630.3 ) , and a wind model is therefore to be preferred . if this is the case , the adaf flux in the optical  uv would be much fainter ( at least two order of magnitude ) than that of the host galaxy , again consistent with the present findings .",
    "we have carried out a pilot program to study the faint hard x - ray source population using the revolutionary capabilities of the _ chandra _ satellite .",
    "we identified ten 210 kev selected sources from two 4-chip , medium deep _ chandra _ fields covering about 0.14 deg@xmath15 of sky at fluxes in the range @xmath69 , a factor of 3 fainter than previous asca and bepposax surveys .",
    "recently , mushotzky et al . ( 2000 ) reported detection of faint x - ray sources from a single 1chip field ( 0.0175 deg@xmath15 ) at fluxes @xmath70 .",
    "our results fill the gap between the shallow bepposax and asca surveys and the deep _ chandra _ field .",
    "almost all sources have an optical counterpart within 2 arcsec .",
    "optical spectra allow us to measure their redshifts , and assess their optical classification .",
    "we find six broad line quasars , two emission line agn ( lar6 and p4 ) , one starburst galaxy ( lar5 ) , and one apparently normal galaxy at @xmath1=0.158 ( p3 ) .",
    "lar6 and p4 are likely to be obscured in x - ray by a column densities of @xmath71 @xmath50 and @xmath72 @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the x - ray source in the @xmath1=0.158 normal galaxy p3 may be covered by a column density of about @xmath59 @xmath50 too .",
    "the spatial extension of all x - ray sources is smaller than a few arcsec in all cases , and it is roughly consistent with the _ chandra _ psf .",
    "the x - ray sources associated with the @xmath1=0.016 starburst galaxy lar5 and the @xmath1=0.158 normal galaxy p3 appear coincident with the galaxy nuclei .",
    "the x - ray to optical luminosity ratio of p3 is higher by a factor of at least 30 than those of normal galaxies , while it is similar to those of agn .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity and the lack of optical emission lines suggest an agn in which either continuum beaming is important or emission lines are absorbed or not efficiently produced . in any case , objects like p3 would be missed or ignored in optical surveys or in x - ray surveys with large error boxes .",
    "it is only thanks to the new revolutionary capabilities of _ chandra _ that this kind of sources _ can _ be detected and identified .",
    "based on the asca and bepposax surveys at fluxes @xmath73 and on our first _",
    "_ identifications , which push the flux limit down to @xmath74 , the hard x - ray sky appears populated by a large fraction of broad line agn ( about 50% ) , by a mixture of intermediate agn ( type 1.8 - 2.0 and composite starburst / agn ) and , most intriguingly , also by x - ray luminous apparently normal galaxies .",
