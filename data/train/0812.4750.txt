    "this leads to some complications in studying the dynamics of fluctuations of these operators : the dynamics of fluctuations of operators which seem to be rather simple in spin language may be governed by many - particle correlations in fermionic language . as we have discussed in sections [ secdk4 ] , [ secdk5 ] , [ secdk6 ] , the jordan - wigner fermionization approach permits to establish a number of rigorous results for the dynamics of spin-1/2 @xmath6 chains . especially easy",

    "<S> the jordan - wigner transformation is known as a powerful tool in condensed matter theory , especially in the theory of low - dimensional quantum spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this chapter is to review the application of the jordan - wigner fermionization technique for calculating dynamic quantities of low - dimensional quantum spin models . after a brief introduction of the jordan - wigner transformation for one - dimensional spin one - half systems and some of its extensions for higher dimensions and higher spin values we focus on the dynamic properties of several low - dimensional quantum spin models . </S>",
    "<S> we start from the famous @xmath0 @xmath1 chain . as a first step we recall well - known results for dynamics of the @xmath2-spin - component fluctuation operator and then turn to the dynamics of the dimer and trimer fluctuation operators . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the trimer fluctuations involves both the two - fermion ( one particle and one hole ) and the four - fermion ( two particles and two holes ) excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some properties of the two - fermion and four - fermion excitation continua . </S>",
    "<S> the four - fermion dynamic quantities are of intermediate complexity between simple two - fermion ( like the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor ) and enormously complex multi - fermion ( like the @xmath4 or @xmath5 dynamic structure factors ) dynamic quantities . </S>",
    "<S> further we discuss the effects of dimerization , anisotropy of @xmath6 interaction , and additional dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on various dynamic quantities . </S>",
    "<S> finally we consider the dynamic transverse spin structure factor @xmath7 for the @xmath0 @xmath1 model on a spatially anisotropic square lattice which allows one to trace a one - to - two - dimensional crossover in dynamic quantities . </S>"
