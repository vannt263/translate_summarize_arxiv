    "low - energy physics of equilibrium systems with weakly interacting electrons is well understood both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the relevant information about the equilibrium system is contained in one- and two - particle green functions , in particular in their behavior around the fermi energy .",
    "a number of reliable approximate methods have been developed for the calculation of these functions . among them , systematic renormalized perturbation expansions based on the many - body feynman diagrammatic technique have proved most effective . when impurities or quenched configurational randomness are added we still are able to describe equilibrium properties of such a system quite reliably within diagrammatic schemes and a mean - field - type coherent - potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite    the situation gets less straightforward if we come out of equilibrium .",
    "this is the case when the system is disturbed by a time - dependent external force but does not manage to reach a new equilibrium within the relaxation times of the experimental setup .",
    "we then have to determine the response of the system to the external perturbation to obtain experimentally relevant data .",
    "however , we do not have at our disposal many established methods to calculate nonequilibrium response functions .",
    "when the perturbation is weak , which is the most common situation in practice , we can use linear response theory to calculate effectively the response functions.@xcite a fundamental tool for the calculation of response functions within the linear - response theory is the kubo formalism.@xcite it determines how the response functions of the disturbed nonequilibrium system can be expressed in terms of two - particle green ( correlation ) functions that are characteristics of an equilibrium state .",
    "kubo formulas are means for the description of nonequilibrium systems with equilibrium functions . unlike the response functions ,",
    "the equilibrium green functions obey equations of motion and are suitable for developing systematic approximations within many - body diagrammatic techniques .",
    "kubo formalism , however , provides different representations for different response functions that we have to approximate separately .",
    "the problem that emerges with independent approximations for different response functions via different kubo formulas is that we are usually unable to keep exact relations between response functions that may hold due to special symmetries of the system under investigation .",
    "most pronounced case with `` hidden '' symmetries is the response to a weak electromagnetic perturbation where we have to satisfy gauge invariance and charge and current conservations .",
    "instantaneous field - dependent deviations of charge and current densities from their equilibrium values are described by density and current response functions . within linear - response theory",
    "these functions are obtained from independent kubo formulas with density - density and current - current correlation functions , respectively . although both correlation functions are derived from the same two - particle green function , they are normally approximated independently according to the purpose they serve to .",
    "when quantum coherence is negligible we can calculate the transport properties from the coherent - potential approximation.@xcite there is no contribution to the homogeneous current - current correlation function beyond the single electron - hole bubble in the single - band coherent - potential approximation.@xcite hence most theories beyond the cpa , either on model or realistic level , use the kubo formula for the electrical conductivity with the current - current correlation function to determine transport properties of disordered solids.@xcite    on the other hand , when quantum coherence effects are substantial and we expect the anderson metal - insulator transition , electrical conductivity is usually calculated from the electron - hole correlation function with the aid of the diffusion constant controlling its low - energy behavior near the diffusion pole.@xcite the diffusion pole is crucial and enables application of scaling arguments and the renormalization group approach to anderson localization.@xcite    there is a number of more or less heuristic arguments in the literature that relate the density response with the conductivity.@xcite they are essentially based on gauge invariance and charge conservation of a semiclassical equilibrium description of an electron gas exposed to an electromagnetic field . in weakly disordered quantum systems ( described by continuum models ) a relation between the density response and conductivity can formally be derived as follows.@xcite gauge invariance is used to relate the external scalar potential with the electric field @xmath0 .",
    "the current density generated by the external field then is @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes tensor of the electrical conductivity .",
    "charge conservation is expressed by a continuity equation . in equilibrium",
    "we can use its operator form that follows from the heisenberg equations of motion for the current and density operators . for hamiltonians with quadratic dispersion relation",
    "we have @xmath3 energy - momentum representation of the continuity equation in the ground - state solution is @xmath4 we have to use a density variation of the equilibrium density , i.  e. , the externally induced density @xmath5 in the continuity equation with averaged values of operators . from the above equations and for linear response @xmath6 we obtain in the isotropic case @xmath7 the derived equality formally holds for complex functions without restrictions on momenta or frequencies .",
    "frequencies can , in principle , be even complex .",
    "relation is often taken as granted for the whole range of the disorder strength and used for the definition of the zero - temperature conductivity when describing anderson localization transition.@xcite    although the above derivation may seem very general it suffers from a few flaws .",
    "first , the operator continuity equation can not be directly used out of equilibrium .",
    "a new term due to causality of the response functions enters the continuity equation when the equilibrium is disturbed .",
    "moreover the nonequilibrium density and current operators in linear - response theory no longer obey heisenberg equations of motion with the perturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the perturbation is decoupled from the equilibrium hamiltonian and is treated only to linear order .",
    "second , strongly disordered electron systems can be desribed only by lattice models with a nonquadratic dispersion relation .",
    "continuity equation is then to be modified even in equilibrium .",
    "hence the above , in the literature broadly disseminated reasoning leading to eq .",
    "can not be fully trusted in quantitative studies of strongly disordered systems out of equilibrium .",
    "presently there is no reliable theory of strongly disordered electrons beyond the mean - field cpa . since mean - field approximations",
    "do not include vertex corrections to the electrical conductivity they are not suitable for the investigation of localization effects in three spatial dimensions .",
    "unlike low dimensions ( @xmath8 ) , anderson localization in @xmath9 may occur only in strongly disordered systems .",
    "anderson localization in bulk systems has not yet been understood or quantitatively described in a satisfactory manner .",
    "its quantitative description demands bridging the gap between the mean - field ( cpa ) transport theory and theories for weakly and strongly localized electron states .",
    "it is clear that such an interpolating scheme should be based on advanced approximations for two - particle functions .",
    "recently a diagrammatic method for summations of classes of two - particle diagrams has been proposed.@xcite this theory has a potential to interpolate between the mean - field and localization theories provided exact relations between the density and current response functions have been proved for this scheme in the whole range of the disorder strength .",
    "criteria for validity of relations between density - density and current - current correlation functions in approximate treatments of strongly disordered systems have not yet been established .",
    "when we want to go beyond the cpa we still have to establish such relations in the metallic regime of tight - binding models with extended electron states .",
    "simultaneously we have to formulate conditions under which the derived relations hold or may be broken .",
    "the aim of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we derive various relations between current - current , current - density , and density - density correlation functions for strongly disordered electrons out of equilibrium , i.  e. , beyond the reach of the existing derivations .",
    "second , we articulate conditions under which these relations hold or to which extent they may be broken in quantitative treatments and show when the conductivity can be calculated from the density response function and vice versa .",
    "third , we introduce a generalization of diffusion via a quantum response function , test validity of the einstein relation for this quantum diffusion , and relate quantum diffusion with its classical counterpart and with the diffusion pole in the electron - hole correlation function .    to reach this goal we use kubo formalism and averaged many - body green functions .",
    "in this approach a weaker form of the continuity equation expressed in terms of one- and two - particle green functions replaces the operator identity .",
    "it is derived from equations of motion for green functions and ward identities between them .",
    "we use two ward identities that are not fully equivalent .",
    "one expresses conservation of probability and the other reflects charge conservation .",
    "each ward identity is used in a different manner to relate the conductivity with the density response .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : density_current ] we summarize the definitions and useful representations of the density and current response functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : einstein_relation ] we show how the current - current correlation function emerges from a momentum expansion of the density response function . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamical_conductivity ] we derive continuity equations expressed in green functions and use them to show how the density response function can be revealed from the conductivity . based on the exactly derived relation between the density and current response function we introduce in sec .",
    "[ sec : diff_einstein ] quantum diffusion , derive the diffusion pole in the hydrodynamic limit of the density response function and relate the diffusion constant to the conductivity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : infinite_d ] we illustrate general results on an exactly solvable limit of infinite spatial dimensions . in appendix",
    "we discuss assumptions for and the range of validity of the vollhardt - wlfle - ward identity used in the derivation of the continuity equation for green functions .",
    "a simplest description of the electron motion in impure , weakly correlated metals is provided by a tight - binding anderson model .",
    "it assumes noninteracting spinless electrons moving in a random , site - diagonal potential @xmath10 .",
    "its hamiltonian reads @xmath11 the values of the random potential @xmath10 are site - independent and obey a disorder distribution @xmath12 .",

    "each selected ( relevant ) diagram of order @xmath189 from the formal expansion of the singular two - particle vertex generates in the ward identity @xmath190 irrelevant diagrams to complete the sum from the right - hand side of eq .   so that the self - energy difference can be represented via the vertex @xmath94 .",
    "the irrelevant diagrams are neglected in approximations with selected dominant classes of diagrams violating then identity .",
    "hence summability of the perturbation expansion for the two - particle irreducible vertex is an additive assumption in the proof of the ward identity .",
