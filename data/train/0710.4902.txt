    "aspects of which have played a key role in the lore of general relativity in the past half century .",

    "these classes correspond to equivalence classes modulo the same group action of @xmath1 .",
    "it is not surprising that there should be a nice relationship between the two mathematical structures , and it is this relationship which gives added meaning to the lifshitz - khalatnikov parametrization of the kasner indices , introduced in order to describe collisions with curvature potential walls in asymptotic gravitational dynamics in a simple way , now seen in terms of simple transitions of the weyl tensor eigenvalue ratios .    to summarize the key points which the following discussion illuminates in detail :    1 .",

    "the petrov classification distinguishes between algebraically general spacetimes ( type i ) and algebraically special ones ( types d , ii , n , iii and o ) depending on the degeneracy of eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the above spectral problem .",
    "one way of determining whether a given spacetime is general or special involves evaluating the invariants = 12 tr q^2 = 12 ( _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2+_3 ^ 2 ) , = 16 tr q^3 = 16 ( _ 1 ^ 3+_2 ^ 3+_3 ^ 3 ) . for petrov types i and then d and ii in the top two levels of the petrov hierarchy , both invariants @xmath50 and @xmath51 are nonzero , while both vanish for types o , n and iii in the lowest level of the three level pyramid .",
    "any algebraically special spacetime satisfies ^3=27 ^2 so except for most degenerate types o , n and iii in the petrov hierarchy , one can introduce the so called  speciality index \" which is a well defined function of the eigenvalues @xmath47 by taking the dimensionless ratio ( which is therefore independent of the overall scale of the eigenvalues ) @xmath52 having the value 1 for the algebraically special types d and ii and obviously invariant under any permutation of the eigenvalues .",
    "this quantity is related to the similar invariant quantity @xmath53 introduced earlier by mcintosh and arianrhodtf @xcite by the relation = ( 1+m/27)^-1 .",
    "they used this quantity to simplify the discussion the geometry of the set of principal null directions of the weyl tensor described by penrose and rindler @xcite , and applied this insight to the kasner and curzon metrics .",
    "the tracefree condition @xmath10 does not constrain the overall scale of the three eigenvalues , but it does lead to only one independent ratio among them .",
    "choosing @xmath54 , then it follows from the constraint that @xmath55 and therefore @xmath56 , so the six possible ratios @xmath11 ( @xmath57 ) are given by the following formulas in terms of one of them @xmath58 @xmath59 thus any scale invariant ( i.e. , dimensionless ) function of the eigenvalues can only depend on @xmath60 , which must be the case for the speciality index",
