    "the heavy - heavy - light mesons coupling constants are fundamental objects as they can provide essential information on the low energy qcd .",
    "their numerical values obtained in qcd can bring important constraints in constructing the meson - meson potentials and strong interactions among them . in the recent years",
    ", both theoretical and experimental studies on heavy mesons have received considerable attention . in this connection",
    ", excited experimental results obtained in babar , fermilab , cleo , cdf , d0 , etc . @xcite and some physical properties of these mesons have been studied using various theoretical models ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in this article , we calculate the strong coupling constants , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the framework of three - point qcd sum rules considering contributions of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons as off - shell states , but in the absence of radiative corrections . the result of these coupling constants can help us to better analyze the results of existing experiments hold at different centers .",
    "for instance , consider the @xmath6 meson or the newly discovered charmonium states , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 by babar and belle collaborations .",
    "these states decay to a @xmath10 or @xmath11 and a light meson in the final state .",
    "however , it is supposed that first these states decay into an intermediate two body states containing @xmath12 or @xmath13 with @xmath14 or @xmath15 quarks , then these intermediate states decay into final stats with the exchange of one or more virtual mesons . the similar procedure may happen in decays of heavy bottonium . hence , to get precise information about such transitions , we need to have information about the coupling constants between participating particles .    calculation of the heavy - heavy - light mesons coupling constants via the fundamental theory of qcd is highly valuable .",
    "however , such interactions lie in a region very far from the perturbative regime , hence the fundamental qcd lagrangian can not be responsible in this respect .",
    "therefore , we need some non - perturbative approaches like qcd sum rules @xcite as one of the most powerful and applicable tools to hadron physics .",
    "note that , the coupling constants , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 @xcite , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xcite have been investigated using different approaches .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we give the details of qcd sum rules for the considered coupling constants when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons in the final state are off - shell .",
    "the next section is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussion .",
    "in this section , we derive qcd sum rules for coupling constants . for this aim",
    ", we will evaluate the three - point correlation functions , @xmath33 for @xmath2 off - shell , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 off - shell . here",
    "@xmath36 is the time ordering operator and @xmath37 is transferred momentum .",
    "each meson interpolating field can be written in terms of the quark field operators as following form : @xmath38}(y)&= & \\overline{u}(y)\\gamma_{5}c[b](y ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\eta^{d_{s}^{\\ast}[b_{s}^{\\ast}]}_{\\mu}(0)&= & \\overline{s}(0)\\gamma_{\\mu}c[b](0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlation functions are calculated in two different ways . in phenomenological or physical side , they are obtained in terms of hadronic parameters . in theoretical or qcd side , they are evaluated in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom by the help of the operator product expansion ( ope ) in deep euclidean region .",
    "the sum rules for the coupling constants are obtained equating the coefficient of a sufficient structure from both sides of the same correlation functions . to suppress contribution of the higher states and continuum , double borel transformation with respect to the variables ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 is applied .",
    "first , let us focus on the calculation of the physical side of the first correlation function ( eq.([correlationfunc1 ] ) ) for an off - shell @xmath2 meson .",
    "the physical part is obtained by saturating eq .",
    "( [ correlationfunc1 ] ) with the complete sets of appropriate @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath35 states with the same quantum numbers as the corresponding interpolating currents .",
    "after performing four - integrals over @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we obtain : @xmath45 where .... represents the contribution of the higher states and continuum .",
    "the matrix elements appearing in the above equation are defined in terms of hadronic parameters such as masses , leptonic decay constants and coupling constant , i.e. , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is coupling constant when @xmath2 is off - shell and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the polarization vectors associated with the @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . using eq .",

    "it should be reminded that the heavy quark condensates contributions are suppressed by inverse of the heavy quark mass , so they can be safely neglected . therefore , as nonperturbative part , we only encounter contributions coming from light quark condensates .",
    "contributions of the diagrams ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) in fig.([figure ] ) are zero since applying double borel transformation with respect to the both variables @xmath39 and @xmath72 will kill them because of appearing only one variable in the denominator in these cases . hence , we calculate the diagram ( c ) in fig.([figure ] ) for the off - shell @xmath2 meson . as a result",
    ", we obtain : @xmath73 for the off - shell d meson and @xmath74 for the off - shell b meson .",
    "now , it is time to apply the double borel transformations with respect to the @xmath75 and @xmath76 to the physical as well as the qcd sides and equate the coefficient of the selected structure from two representations .",
    "finally , we get the following sum rules for the corresponding coupling constant form factors :    @xmath77e^{\\frac{-s}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{-s^{\\prime } } { { m^{\\prime}}^2}}+{\\langle}\\overline{s}s{\\rangle } e^{\\frac{m_c^2}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{m_u^2}{{m^{\\prime}}^2}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath78e^{\\frac{-s}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{-s^{\\prime } } { { m^{\\prime}}^2}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the off - shell d and @xmath35 meson associated with the @xmath66 vertex , respectively , and @xmath79e^{\\frac{-s}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{-s^{\\prime } } { { m^{\\prime}}^2}}+{\\langle}\\overline{s}s{\\rangle } e^{\\frac{m_b^2}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{m_u^2}{{m^{\\prime}}^2}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath80e^{\\frac{-s}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{-s^{\\prime } } { { m^{\\prime}}^2}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the off - shell b and @xmath35 meson associated with the @xmath69 vertex , respectively . the integration regions in the perturbative part in eqs .",
    "( [ coupcons - gdsdks - doffshel])-([coupcons - gbsbks - ksoffshel ] ) are determined requiring that the arguments of the three @xmath81 functions coming from cutkosky rule vanish simultaneously .",
    "so , the physical regions in the @xmath15 - @xmath82 plane are described by the following non - equalities : @xmath83 @xmath84 for the off - shell d and @xmath35 meson associated with the @xmath66 vertex , respectively , and @xmath85 @xmath86 for the off - shell b and @xmath35 meson associated with the @xmath69 vertex , respectively .",
    "these physical regions are imposed by the limits on the integrals and step functions in the integrands of the sum rules . in order to subtract the contributions of the higher states and continuum ,",
    "the quark - hadron duality assumption is used , i.e. , it is assumed that , @xmath87 note that , the double borel transformation used in calculations is defined as : @xmath88",
    "present section is devoted to the numerical analysis of the sum rules for the coupling constants .",
    "in further analysis , we use , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 @xcite , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96@xcite , @xmath97 , @xmath98@xcite , @xmath99 , @xmath100 @xcite , @xmath101 @xcite , @xmath102 @xcite and @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the sum rules for the strong coupling constants contain also four auxiliary parameters , namely the borel mass parameters , @xmath104 and @xmath105 and the continuum thresholds , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "since these parameters are not physical quantities , our results should be independent of them .",
    "therefore , we look for working regions at which the dependence of coupling constants on these auxiliary parameters are weak",
    ". the working regions for the borel mass parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 are determined requiring that both the contributions of the higher states and continuum are sufficiently suppressed and the contributions coming from higher dimensions are small . as a result ,",
    "we obtain , @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 off - shell , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath50 off - shell associated with the @xmath66 vertex .",

    "the dependence of considered coupling constants on borel parameters for different cases are shown in figs.([gdsdksdoffmsq]-[gdsdksksoffmpsq ] ) and ( [ gbsbksboffmsq]-[gbsbksksoffmsq ] ) . from these figures ,",
    "we see a good stability of the results with respect to the borel mass parameters in the working regions .",
    "the continuum thresholds , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are not completely arbitrary but they are correlated to the energy of the first excited states with the same quantum numbers .",
    "our numerical calculations lead to the following regions for the continuum thresholds in @xmath15 and @xmath118 channels for different cases : @xmath119 in @xmath15 channel for both off - shell cases and two vertexes , and @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath50 and @xmath2 off - shell cases , respectively in @xmath118 channel . here",
    ", we should stress that the analysis of sum rules in our work is based on , so called the standard procedure in qcd sum rules , i.e. , the continuum thresholds are independent of borel mass parameters and @xmath122 .",
    "however , recently it is believed that the standard procedure does not render realistic errors and the continuum thresholds depend on borel parameters and @xmath122 and this leads to some uncertainties ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "now , using the working region for auxiliary parameters and other input parameters , we would like to discuss the behavior of the strong coupling constant form factors in terms of @xmath122 .",
    "in the case of off - shell @xmath110 meson related to the @xmath123 vertex , our numerical result is described well by the following mono - polar fit parametrization shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "( [ gdsdksqsq ] ) : @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",

    "the similar observation has also obtained in @xcite in analysis of the @xmath20 vertex . in our case , the two form factors coincide at @xmath138 and have the value @xmath139 very close to the value obtained taking average of the coupling constants for two off - shell cases at @xmath126 .    similarly , for @xmath140 vertex ,",
    "our result for @xmath115 off - shell is better extrapolated by the mono - polar fit parametrization , @xmath141 presented by dashed line in fig .",
