    "type  ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have become one of the best ways for determining the hubble constant , the deceleration parameter , and the cosmological constant ( for a recent review , see filippenko 2005 ) .",
    "they are the most luminous of all supernovae , and can be observed to high redshifts ( @xmath7 ; see strolger & riess ( 2006 ) , and references therein ) . although sne  ia are known to vary in maximum brightness by up to a magnitude in the @xmath8 band @xcite , there is a tight correlation between the decline rate of the light curve and the maximum luminosity @xcite . with corrections for this effect @xcite ,",
    "the relative dispersion in sne  ia maximum magnitudes , and therefore the relative distances , is less than 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "this high precision has allowed the detection of the acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , it should be stressed that in spite of the impressive consistency seen in the relative magnitudes of sne  ia , universal agreement on the absolute magnitudes has not been achieved .",
    "the sne  ia zero - point calibrations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite lead to values that vary by @xmath9 magnitudes .",
    "remarkably , these determinations are based on the identical _ hst _ observations of cepheids in galaxies that hosted sne  ia , with the same assumed distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the differences can be attributed to the use of different cepheid samples and period - luminosity relationships , and different assumptions concerning metallicity corrections and which historical type  ia supernovae to include or exclude in these relations .",
    "there are further complications with relying solely on the current _ hst _ cepheid zero - point calibration of sne  ia s .",
    "first , approximately 27% of sne  ia are hosted in early - type galaxies @xcite . by limiting the zero - point determination to only galaxies that host with cepheid stars",
    ", we are throwing away approximately a quarter of nearby supernovae , a dubious luxury at best , especially considering how few type  ia supernovae are within range of direct distance indicators .",
    "second , and more importantly , observing the absolute magnitudes of sne  ia only over a small range of stellar populations limits our ability to test for any evolutionary differences that might appear in high redshift samples .",
    "theoretical studies give mixed results on the amount and sign of any evolutionary effect on the maximum magnitude of sne  ia @xcite , but the effect could be significant , up to an additional 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "these theoretical analyses are supported by observational evidence showing that there are clear differences between the observed magnitudes of sne  ia observed in elliptical galaxies and sne  ia observed in spiral galaxies .",
    "early results by hamuy et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and follow - up studies @xcite clearly show that sne  ia in early - type galaxies are preferentially less luminous , and have a faster decline rate than those found in late - type galaxies .",
    "more recently , @xcite has shown that these trends continue to redshifts as large as 0.75 .",
    "@xcite has given evidence implying that the stellar population age is the driving force behind the different properties of sne  ia .",
    "it is an open question whether these differences between the supernovae hosted by early type and late type galaxies are fully corrected by the decline rate correction , or whether there might be additional systematic effects left to be uncovered .",
    "there is now some tentative evidence for the latter view .",
    "@xcite has reported a possible negative correlation between host galaxy metallicity and hubble residual , after correction for decline rate .",
    "although the measured difference is less than 2@xmath10 in magnitude , this result , if correct , would imply that metallicity could change the maximum brightness of sne  ia up to 10% .",
    "consequently , it may be beneficial to derive distances to galaxies that have hosted sne  ia and contain more diverse stellar populations than the cepheid distance indicator can probe .",
    "in particular , the [ o  iii ] @xmath11 5007 planetary nebulae luminosity function ( pnlf ) distance indicator @xcite is well - suited to measure the zero - point of sne  ia .",
    "the scatter of the pnlf method is comparable to the scatter of cepheid distance determinations @xcite , making the pnlf an equally precise distance indicator . since planetary nebulae",
    "are present in galaxies of all hubble types , the pnlf method can be used in all galaxies that host sne  ia , allowing for tests of evolutionary effects .",
    "given these advantages , we have begun a program to measure distances to early and late type galaxies that were hosts to well - observed sne  ia using the pnlf distance indicator . with the larger aperture of the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope and the excellent seeing of the 3.5 m wiyn telescope , we can extend the reach of the pnlf method significantly further than the @xmath12 17 mpc limit previously reached with 4-m class telescopes .",
    "our primary goal is to increase the sample of sne  ia with high quality distances within 20 mpc . in this paper , we present the first results of our program , and give a revised hubble constant from the pnlf results thus far .",
    "for this first study , we chose five galaxies that have hosted well - observed sne  ia in the past twenty five years : ngc  524 , ngc  1316 , ngc  1380 , ngc  1448 , and ngc  4526 .",
    "most of these galaxies are early - type spirals and lenticulars , being unsuitable for cepheid observations .",
    "properties of the target galaxies , and the observed supernovae that they hosted are given in table  [ table : target ] .",
    "two telescopes were used in this study .",
    "our first observations were obtained on 1820 december 2003 and 1112 november 2004 using the magellan landon clay telescope , and the magic camera @xcite .",
    "this camera consists of a site 2048x2048 ccd detector with 24 @xmath13 m pixels , and uses four amplifiers , with a mean gain of 1.96 electrons per adu , and a mean read noise of 5.25 electrons .",
    "this instrumental setup gave a pixel scale of 0.069 arcseconds per pixel and a field - of - view of @xmath14 .",
    "we supplemented our magellan observations with additional data obtained on 1011 march 2005 using the wiyn 3.5 m telescope , and the optic camera @xcite .",
    "this camera consists of two 2kx4k ccid-28 orthogonal transfer ccds arranged in a single dewar .",
    "this setup has a read noise of 4 electrons and a gain of 1.45 electrons per adu .",
    "the instrumental set - up at wiyn gave a pixel scale of 0.14 arcseconds per pixel and a total field - of - view of @xmath15 .",
    "our survey technique is similar to other extragalactic searches for planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "depending on redshift , we obtained exposures for our target galaxies through one of two 30    wide [ o  iii ] @xmath0 filters , whose central wavelengths are 5027    and 5040   respectively .",
    "the filter curves , compared against the expected wavelength of the red - shifted [ o  iii ] @xmath11 5007 emission line are shown in figure  [ fig : filters ] .",
    "corresponding images were then taken for all the galaxies through a 230    wide off - band continuum filter ( central wavelength @xmath16   ) . in the case of ngc  1448 and ngc  4526",
    ", exposures were also taken through a 44    wide h@xmath17 filter ( central wavelength @xmath18   ) , in order to remove possible contamination from h  ii regions .",
    "we also obtained observations of the spectrophotometric standards ltt  377 , ltt  1020 , ltt  3218 , ltt  4364 , eg  21 , hiltner  600 , feige  34 , feige  56 , feige  98 , kopff  27 , bd  + 25 3941 and bd  + 33 2642 to determine our photometric zero point @xcite .",
    "a log of our observations is given in table  [ table : log ] .",
    "at least one night of each telescope run was photometric , which allowed us to put our pn observations on the standard system .",
    "the magellan data were bias - subtracted at the telescope , using the iraf reduction system .",
    "the magic camera has a small ( 60113 milliseconds ) , but known , shutter error that varies with position on the detector . for our target images ,",
    "whose exposure times range from 200 to 1800s , the effect of the shutter error is negligible .",
    "however , for our dome - flat frames , and standard star images , this effect could be significant .",
    "these data were corrected for the shutter error by multiplying each image by a shutter correction image .",
    "the shutter correction image was constructed by dividing a long dome flat exposure of 20s in length by an average of 20 one second exposures .",
    "this process was repeated five times so that a high signal - to - noise correction image was constructed .",
    "after the flat - field exposures were corrected for the shutter error , all of the data were flat - fielded using iraf .",
    "the optic data taken at wiyn were reduced following standard ccd mosaic imager procedures using the iraf mscred package @xcite . because we did not use optic s electronic tip / tilt compensation feature for these observations , no special processing steps were required beyond the usual overscan correction , bias subtraction , and flat - fielding . unlike the magic camera , no significant shutter corrections were required .",
    "the individual galaxy images were then aligned using the imshift task within iraf .",
    "the shifts were determined by measuring positions of stars common to all frames .",
    "the images were then averaged using the imcombine task .",
    "finally , as the images were oversampled spatially ( @xmath12 1013 pixels fwhm for the magellan data , and @xmath12 48 pixels fwhm for the wiyn data ) , the data were binned up into squares of 2 x 2 or 4 x 4 pixels .",
    "this is known to improve the signal - to - noise of stellar detection and photometry @xcite , as long as the binning is less than the critical sampling level .",
    "the final [ o  iii ] magellan images of each galaxy are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] , and the final wiyn image of ngc  4526 is shown in figure  [ fig : n4526image ]",
    "planetary nebulae candidates were found on our frames using the semi - automated detection code of @xcite .",
    "briefly , pn candidates should appear as point sources in the [ o  iii ] @xmath11 5007 images , but should be completely absent in the off - band images , and weak or absent in the h@xmath17 image .",
    "the code searches for objects that match these properties in two different ways : by using a color - magnitude diagram , and through a difference image analysis .",
    "both methods find many of the same objects , but there is a population of candidates that can only be found in one method , and not the other @xcite . this automated code has been rigorously tested , with comparisons of previous manual searches of pn candidates , and by artificial star experiments ( see feldmeier et  al .",
    "2003 for full details ) .",
    "these previous tests have found that the automated detection code finds virtually all candidates that have a signal - to - noise of nine or larger , and also finds the vast majority of candidates below this limit .",
    "once preliminary lists of candidates were compiled , they were screened through a number of tests to ensure that they were genuine .",
    "the tests included removing duplicate objects , removing candidates around saturated stars and other bad regions of the image , removing any object that had a signal - to - noise less than the cutoff value of four @xcite .",
    "since these images were relatively small , one of us ( j.f . ) also manually `` blinked '' the on - band and off - band images to ensure that no genuine candidates were missed by the automated detection code .",
    "no such objects were found in the magellan data , but a few pn candidates were found close to the nucleus of ngc  4526 that the detection code missed .",
    "we believe this is due to the steep and varying sky background from the galaxy , and not due to a flaw in the detection code .",
    "finally , each planetary candidate was visually inspected , and any object that did not fit the selection criteria was removed . in total , we identified 45 pn candidates in ngc  1316 , 44 pn candidates in ngc  1380 , 94 pn candidates in ngc  4526 , and no pn candidates in ngc  524 and ngc  1448 . a selection of pn candidates found in ngc  1316 , ngc  1380 and ngc  4526 are displayed in figure  [ fig : examples ] for illustrative purposes . for each galaxy",
    ", we display a candidate near the bright end of the luminosity function , and an object near the photometric completeness limit to properly compare our detections as a function of signal - to - noise .",
    "the pn candidates were measured photometrically using the iraf version of daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , and flux calibrated using @xcite standard stars and the procedures outlined by jacoby , quigley , & africano ( 1987 ) .",
    "the resulting monochromatic fluxes were then converted to @xmath19 magnitudes using : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is in units of ergs @xmath22 s@xmath6 .",
    "the scatter from the standard stars is small , 0.01 magnitudes for the magellan data , and 0.03 magnitudes for the wiyn data .",
    "equatorial coordinates were then obtained for each planetary nebula candidate by comparing its position to those of usno - a 2.0 astrometric stars ( monet 1998 ; monet et  al .  1996 ) on the same frame . to calculate the plate coefficients , the finder astrometric package within iraf was used . due to the small angular sizes of the magellan images ,",
    "the final fit used approximately 510 usno - a 2.0 stars .",
    "the wiyn image was better constrained , with 23 usno - a 2.0 stars in the final solution .",
    "the external errors from the usno - a 2.0 catalog are believed to be less than 0.25 arcseconds ( monet 1998 ; monet et  al .",
    "1996 ) , and our fits are generally consistent with this uncertainty . all coordinates are j2000 epoch . the magnitudes and coordinates for the pn candidates in ngc  1316 , ngc  1380 , and ngc  4526 are given in tables 35 .",
    "the names of the candidates follow the new uniform naming convention of extragalactic planetary nebulae ( jacoby & acker 2006 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pnlf ] shows the observed pnlfs for both ngc  1316 and ngc  1380 .",
    "the luminosity functions follow a power law at faint magnitudes , but abruptly drop as a bright limiting magnitude is reached .",
    "this distinctive feature allows us to obtain distances to galaxies at high precision .    in order to derive pnlf distances and their formal uncertainties",
    ", we followed the procedure of @xcite .",
    "we took the analytical form of the pnlf : @xmath23 convolved it with the photometric error vs.  magnitude relation derived from the daophot output ( given in table  [ table : error ] ) , and fit the resultant curve to the statistical samples of pn via the method of maximum likelihood .",
    "since our ability to detect pn in these two galaxies was not a strong function of position , we determined the completeness for both galaxies by noting where the pnlf ( which should be exponentially increasing ) begins to turn down .",
    "this corresponds to an effective signal - to - noise ration of approximately nine for our candidates . to correct for foreground extinction",
    ", we used the @xmath24 dirbe / iras all - sky map of @xcite , and the reddening curve of @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath25 . finally , to estimate the total uncertainties in our measurements",
    ", we convolved the formal errors of the maximum - likelihood fits with the errors associated with the photometric zero points of the ccd frames ( 0.01  mag ) , the filter response curves ( 0.05  mag ) , the definition of the pnlf ( 0.03  mag ) , and the galactic foreground extinction ( 0.02  mag * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt a pnlf cutoff of @xmath26 , consistent with the revision of the zero point by @xcite .",
    "based on these assumptions , the most likely distance modulus for ngc  1316 is @xmath27 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath1  mpc .",
    "this distance assumes a foreground extinction of e(b - v ) = 0.021 @xcite .",
    "the most likely distance modulus for ngc  1380 is @xmath28 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath2  mpc , and assuming a foreground extinction of e(b - v ) = 0.017 @xcite .    for ngc  1380",
    ", we can also calculate the observed production rate of planetary nebulae as a function of bolometric magnitude , which is parameterized by the quantity @xmath29 ( ciardullo 1995 ) . to do this , we first determined the stellar bolometric luminosity of the galaxy in our survey frame .",
    "we fitted the galaxy light profile of the off - band image using the ellipse task in iraf / stsdas ( busko 1996 ; based on the algorithms of jedrzejewski 1987 ) , and compared the luminosity found to the total @xmath30 band magnitude found by @xcite .",
    "after accounting for the fraction of the galaxy that could not be surveyed due to crowding , we find an apparent bolometric magnitude of 10.3 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath29 parameter , summed over all distances was @xmath31  pn-@xmath32 .",
    "this value is within the expected range found for elliptical galaxies @xcite .      for ngc  4526 , we plot the observed pnlf in figure  [ fig : n4526pnlf ] .",
    "a visual inspection of the luminosity function shows that it is declining slowly at the bright end , unlike the sharp cutoffs seen in the pnlfs of ngc  1316 and ngc  1380 and most other galaxies in which the pnlf has been measured .",
    "a more striking effect can be seen when we divide the ngc  4526 candidate pn sample into two equal sub - samples . using the on - band image , the ellipse task in iraf / stsdas , and the procedures outlined in @xcite , we measured the isophotal parameters of ngc  4526 , and determined a radial coordinate @xmath33 for each pn candidate .",
    "we define @xmath33 as the geometric mean of the semi - major and semi - minor axes at the position of each pn candidate : @xmath34 . from this radial coordinate , we then divided the 94 pn candidates of ngc  4526 evenly into an inner and outer sub - sample",
    ". the classification for each object is given in table  5 , column 5 as the letter i or o , and the two sub - samples are shown visually in figure  [ fig : n4526image ] .    using the @xcite maximum likelihood method , we then found the pnlf distances to ngc  4526 using the entire sample , the inner sub - sample , and the outer sub - sample .",
    "those results are plotted in figure  [ fig : inout ] .",
    "there is a noticeable offset between the distance found from the three samples .",
    "the entire sample has a best fitting distance modulus of @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the outer sample has a best - fitting distance modulus of @xmath36 , and the inner sample has a best - fitting distance modulus of @xmath37 , where the error bars denote the results of the maximum likelihood fit only , and not any other effects .",
    "there is a difference of @xmath38 in distance modulus between the inner and outer sub - samples .    in pnlf observations of over 40 galaxies , these systematic behaviors with radius",
    "have only been seen previously in elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite , and have been studied in detail in one galaxy : m87 @xcite . in that case , the flattening of the observed pnlf , and the differences between inner and outer samples were found to be due to the presence of intracluster planetary nebulae ( ipn ) in the virgo cluster . of these ipn",
    ", there will be some foreground to the galaxy of interest , which will have a brighter apparent magnitude , and hence distort the observed luminosity function .",
    "the number of foreground pn detected in any region of our ccd field should be roughly proportional to the area of the field ; in the case of ngc  4526 , the outer sample contains @xmath12 11.5 times more area than the inner one , and hence is much more likely to contain contaminating objects .",
    "ngc  4526 is located in subclump `` b '' @xcite of the virgo cluster , several degrees to the south of m87 , but there is abundant evidence to suggest that ipn are the cause of the distance offsets observed .",
    "several hundred ipn candidates have been observed in multiple fields of the virgo cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , virgo ipn field 6 @xcite lies less than @xmath39 from ngc  4526 .",
    "assuming a mean virgo distance of @xmath12 15 mpc , this corresponds to a linear transverse distance of only @xmath12 210 kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfcomp ] directly compares the pnlf of ngc  4526 to that of ipn field 6 . the luminosity functions sample comparable brightness , and several ipn candidates in field  6 have apparent magnitudes similar to the brightest pn candidates observed in the ngc  4526 field .",
    "if we scale the areas and the photometric depths of the two different observed fields , we find that we would expect at least two ipn objects within the magnitude range of m@xmath40 and within the angular area of the ngc  4526 inner and outer samples .",
    "however , since there is known spatial structure in the ipn distribution of virgo @xcite , significant departures from this statistic are possible .",
    "if we could separate the ipn distribution from the pn bound to the galaxy , in principle we would obtain a distance as precise as any other pnlf observations .",
    "however , without further information , it is problematic to separate the two samples cleanly .",
    "we therefore adopt the inner sample for our distance determination , as it should contain an order of magnitude less foreground contamination . in order to be conservative , we add a 0.15  mag systematic error in quadrature with our other errors to account for potential foreground contamination .",
    "we then follow the identical procedures for finding the distances given above .",
    "we find the most likely distance modulus for ngc  4526 to be @xmath41 , assuming a foreground extinction of e(b - v ) = 0.022 @xcite .",
    "this distance modulus corresponds to a distance of @xmath3  mpc .",
    "we should be able to improve our measurement of the distance by obtaining radial velocities of the pn candidates around ngc  4526 .",
    "it is unlikely that the foreground ipn will have the same radial velocities as pn bound to the galaxy , and therefore we will be able to separate the two samples in a straightforward fashion .",
    "in the case of ngc  524 , and ngc  1448 , we detected no planetary nebulae candidates , so we can only obtain a lower limit to the distances in these galaxies .",
    "normally , this is done by determining the completeness function as a function of magnitude through artificial star experiments , adopting a completeness limit , and finding the distance modulus that would correspond to that limit , assuming that limit corresponded to a pn with the brightest absolute magnitude , @xmath42 .",
    "although the completeness function generally drops steeply as a function of magnitude once a critical level has passed , it is not a simple step - function . for most imaging surveys ,",
    "there is also a transition zone , with a range of approximately one magnitude , where the completeness is declining , but is still non - zero .",
    "we can obtain more accurate and robust distance limits by taking the full completeness function into account .",
    "since this situation is generally applicable to any distance indicator that uses a luminosity function , such as the globular cluster luminosity function distance indicator ( gclf ; see a recent review by richtler 2003 ) , or the tip of the red giant branch distance indicator ( trgb ; see the review by freedman & madore 1998 ) , we give a formal derivation for this procedure below .",
    "we note that this formalism assumes that the luminosity function of the distance indicator is well determined for the galaxy type in question . if the luminosity function is not well determined , the formalism will be of limited usefulness .",
    "the number of objects expected , @xmath43 , in an imaging survey of a limited photometric depth can be expressed as follows :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the apparent magnitude luminosity function and @xmath46 is the completeness function , defined as the probability of detecting an object with an apparent magnitude @xmath47 . for this analysis , we will assume that @xmath48 is solely a function of @xmath47 , though this analysis can be expanded to include other effects , such as position or object surface brightness .",
    "we will also rewrite the luminosity function as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a normalization constant , @xmath13 is the distance modulus , and @xmath51 is the absolute magnitude luminosity function . the actual number of objects detected , @xmath52 , is @xmath43 , subject to the poisson distribution :    @xmath53    we are interested in the case where no objects were detected @xmath54 or @xmath55 . in this case , what limits can we place on @xmath13 , given values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath46 ?    given a typical luminosity function that is rising to fainter absolute magnitudes , we can intuitively see that the distance limits will strongly depend on the total number of objects that are actually present , and hence the value of @xmath50 .",
    "given a pathological galaxy that contained none of the objects searched for in the imaging survey , there would be no effective limit to the distance .",
    "conversely , a galaxy with a very large number of targeted objects would have a distance limit that would be proportional to the inverse of the completeness function 1 - @xmath46 .",
    "unfortunately , instead of a single distance limit , we now have a two dimensional curve in a space of @xmath13 and @xmath50 with the general property that the smaller the value of @xmath50 , the smaller the distance modulus limit @xmath13 .    however , despair is unnecessary .",
    "if we have some prior knowledge on the total number of objects we should expect in our survey region , we can constrain the values of @xmath50 substantially , and hence the distance limit .",
    "let us suppose that the number of objects present in the survey area is proportional to the galaxy luminosity , @xmath56 that is present in that same area and in some photometric system , @xmath57 : @xmath58 note that although we assume that the efficiency rate , @xmath59 , can be expressed as a simple constant , one could integrate a more complex rate over the entire survey area , and get similar results .",
    "the above equation can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the luminosity and absolute magnitude of the sun in that same photometric system . if we can obtain the apparent magnitude of the galaxy from other observations and limit the efficiency rate over some range ( @xmath63 ) , we can reduce the two - dimensional ( @xmath64 ) curve to a curve segment whose arc - length is dependent on how small the range of @xmath59 can be constrained .",
    "a robust distance modulus limit can then be adopted as the minimum @xmath13 allowed .",
    "given the formalism above , we now apply this method to our observations of ngc  524 and ngc  1448 .",
    "we now assume that the completeness function can be approximated in an interpolated form first given by @xcite : @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the apparent magnitude , @xmath66 is the magnitude where the photometric completeness level reaches 50% , and the parameter @xmath67 determines how quickly the completeness fraction declines around the range of @xmath66 .",
    "we determined these two parameters by adding artificial stars using the addstar task within daophot over a range of magnitudes to our data frames . to keep crowding from artificial stars from affecting our results , we added the stars in groups of 100 .",
    "we then searched the frame using the daofind command within daophot , and found the recovery rate as a function of magnitude .",
    "we repeated this process until the completeness functions were well determined , at least 500 times in all .",
    "the results of these experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] , with the best fit to the function by @xcite .    as can be clearly seen",
    ", the function fits well to the completeness simulations of ngc  524 .",
    "however , the @xcite function is a poor fit to the completeness simulations of ngc  1448 .",
    "this is due to crowding from h  ii regions and other non - stellar sources in the galaxy image , and can be seen as the @xmath12 20% false detection rate observed at faint magnitudes . to provide a more realistic fit to the completeness results for ngc  1448 ,",
    "we re - fit the completeness function , but excluding all points fainter than an instrumental magnitude of 28 .",
    "this revised fit is shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] as the dashed line , and we adopt for all further analyses . the best - fitting values for @xmath67 and @xmath66 were 4.41 and 29.97 for ngc  524 , and 0.800 and 27.32 for ngc  1448 , respectively .",
    "the values for @xmath67 and @xmath66 are significantly different for each of the galaxies due to the environment of the two images : the completeness function of ngc  524 is almost purely a case of photometric completeness , while ngc  1448 s completeness function is a combination of photometric completeness and source confusion completeness .",
    "nevertheless , the @xcite function is a reasonable fit to our artificial star results for both galaxies .    with the completeness function established",
    ", we now place limits on the efficiency rate of planetary nebulae production .",
    "historically , this has been parameterized by the value @xmath29 , which is the number of pn within 2.5 magnitudes of the peak magnitude , @xmath68 , divided by the stellar bolometric luminosity .",

    "with the distances to the host galaxies adopted , we now turn to determining the absolute magnitudes of sne  ia , and finding updated estimates for the hubble constant with zero point calibrations given from each of the three distance indicators discussed in  7.3 .",

    "we perform the zero point calibration twice : once for classical optical ( bvi ) and once for near - infrared ( jhk ) observations . by comparing the hubble constants derived from these different wavebands , we can also search for additional systematic effects , such as abnormal reddening , or improper corrections for the known maximum magnitude - decline rate relation .",
    "we proceed as follows : first , taking advantage of the known color evolution of sne  ia from 3090 days @xcite , and using the methodology of @xcite , we estimate the host galaxy extinction . with",
    "the extinction determined , the absolute magnitudes of the sne  ia are now determined , and are given in table  [ table : absmag ] .",
    "next , we correct the bvi light curves for the decline rate versus peak luminosity relationship for sne  ia . specifically , we compare the peak magnitude of the light curve versus the light - curve decline rate parameter @xmath94 .",
    "for the nearby calibrators , we adopt the ideal criteria of riess et al .",
    "these are : 1 ) photometry from photoelectic ( pe ) observations or ccds , 2 ) low host galaxy extinction ( a@xmath95 @xmath96 0.5 mag ) , and 3 ) observed before maximum .",
    "the supernovae that meet these criteria are identified in the last column of table  [ table : distances ] as `` opt '' .",
    "all other sne  ia are omitted from further analysis .",
    "we recognize that these criteria throw out even well - observed supernovae such as sn  1998bu , whose high optical extinction rules it out of our sample ( suntzeff et  al .",
    "1999 ; jha et  al .",
    "1999 ) . however , we concur with riess et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) that the path to a more accurate hubble constant is in utilizing the supernovae that have the fewest potential difficulties .",
    "to compare these nearby supernovae against a more distant sample , which are in the quiet hubble flow but not significantly affected by cosmic acceleration , we used the subset of 38 sne  ia with moderate redshifts ( 7000 km s@xmath6@xmath96 cz @xmath96 24000 km s@xmath6 ) from the sample of @xcite , known as the `` gold '' sample .",
    "the gold sample sne were selected because they do not suffer from any of the following : 1 ) an uncertain classification , 2 ) incomplete photometric record ( e.g. , poor sampling or color information , or non - ccd / pe observations ) , or 3 ) large host extinction ( a@xmath95 @xmath97 1 mag ) .",
    "the results for cepheid , sbf , and pnlf calibrators are summarized in table  [ table : hubblebvi ] , and are illustrated graphically in figure  [ fig : gold ] .",
    "we note that the errors given in both table  [ table : hubblebvi ] and figure  [ fig : gold ] are the internal errors only .",
    "these include errors in estimates of peak magnitudes , decline rates , host galaxy reddening , k corrections , and the fits to the luminosity versus decline rate relations . an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath12 0.16 mag in final luminosity - corrected peak magnitudes is assumed .",
    "however , none of the systematic errors listed in table 14 of @xcite are considered in this analysis . from these results , we find that the results for the cepheid and sbf calibrators are highly consistent , with a mean offset of only 1% .",
    "however , the pnlf calibrators give a hubble constant which is  11 @xmath5 7% ( internal errors only ) greater than the other two methods , which is marginally discrepant .",
    "this offset may be due , in part , to small number statistics .",
    "for example , if we had used only the pnlf calibrators ( 1980n , 1992a , 1994d ) to calibrate the sbf value for the hubble constant , we would have derived a value of @xmath98 for this method , or only 5% larger than the cepheid based result .",
    "the difference of @xmath12 0.32 @xmath5 0.28 mag between sbf and pnlf distance moduli for ngc  4526 might imply that pnlf distance has not been fully corrected for intracluster pnlf (  5.2 )",
    ". however , a similar difference exists for another sn host , ngc 5128 , which is not in a cluster environment , and therefore is unlikely to suffer from the same effect . in any case , the conservative error bars we previously adopted for this galaxy s distance span the possible range of pnlf values for this galaxy .",
    "interestingly , both the sbf and pnlf distances imply a low luminosity for sn 1992a , which falls @xmath99 0.4 mag below the predicted luminosity for sne  ia with similar decline rates .",
    "this is in contradiction with the results of @xcite , who argued that this supernova had a normal luminosity at peak magnitude .",
    "however , given the large error bars on all three direct distance indicators for this galaxy , this result is not definitive .",
    "in addition to the optical analysis , we also performed a separate analysis of sne  ia that have near - infrared observations ( nir ) in the jhk bands .",
    "there are a number of potential advantages to measuring the hubble constant using near - infrared observations of sne  ia .",
    "first , the effects of extinction are dramatically reduced in these bands , by up to a factor of @xmath100 @xcite , and there is less sensitivity to unusual reddening laws @xcite .",
    "this allows us to include supernovae that were rejected in the optical calibration , such as sn 1998bu .",
    "second , it appears that sne  ia are well - behaved in the nir , in that they obey the simple `` stretch '' model at maximum light @xcite .",
    "third , and most importantly , observations to date show that sne  ia are excellent _ constant _ standard candles in the near - infrared ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , with a dispersion less than 0.20 mag .",
    "to calibrate the zero point of sne  ia in these bands , we follow a similar path as our previous analysis . for this calibration",
    ", we have used the methodology of @xcite for the sne light curve fits . in particular , the estimations of the time of maximum light are derived from bvi light curves , since the nir observations of earlier sne  ia were in general more sparsely sampled .",
    "no luminosity corrections have been applied to the nir magnitudes for decline rate differences .    for the distant sample in the hubble flow ,",
    "we use the four sne  ia with jhk light curves from @xcite , plus one sne  ia from @xcite that have radial velocities between 7000 km / s @xmath96 cz @xmath96 24000 km / s , and which were selected to not suffer from any of the following : 1 ) an uncertain classification , 2 ) incomplete photometric record ( e.g. , poor sampling or color information , or non - ccd / pe observations ) in bvi , or 3 ) large host extinction ( a@xmath101 @xmath97 0.5 mag ) .",
    "for the nearby calibrators , we adopt the following selection criteria : 1 ) low host extinction ( a@xmath101 @xmath96 0.5 mag ) , 2 ) observed before maximum in the optical , and 3 ) `` normal '' classification .",
    "sne meeting these criteria are identified in the last column of table  [ table : distances ] as `` nir '' .",
    "the results for cepheid , sbf , and pnlf calibrators are summarized in table  [ table : hubblejhk ] , and are illustrated graphically in figure  [ fig : jhk ] .",
    "again , it should be noted that these errors are internal only .",
    "these include errors in estimates of peak magnitudes , host galaxy reddening , and k corrections . an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath12 0.16 mag @xcite in final peak magnitudes is assumed .",
    "the results for cepheid and sbf calibrators are , again , quite consistent within the errors .",
    "the calibration from the pnlf gives a hubble constant which is 6 @xmath5 10% greater than the other two methods , well within the internal error bars .",
    "the agreement between the three distance scales is noticeably better than obtained using bvi light curves , perhaps because sn 1992a is not one of the nir calibrators .    from these results",
    ", using near - infrared observations of sne  ia to measure the hubble constant is clearly promising , but is currently limited by the small number of sne ia in the hubble flow which have measured jhk light curves .",
    "in particular , only a small range of light curve decline rates ( 0.97 @xmath102 @xmath94@xmath102 1.16 ) are covered by the present sample , and this may lead to an underestimate of any potential systematic effects .",
    "more observations will be needed to fully take advantage of this new method , and place it on a sounder footing .",
    "after combining the results from both the optical and near - infrared calibrations , we find that the hubble constants derived from sne  ia gives h@xmath4 = 75 @xmath5 3 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for cepheid calibrators , h@xmath4 = 76 @xmath5 2 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the sbf , and h@xmath4 = 82 @xmath5 3 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the pnlf .",
    "the difference between the pnlf and cepheid values of h@xmath4 is at the level of 1.67@xmath10 , with the error bars almost overlapping .",
    "this difference is at least partly a consequence of small number statistics .",
    "specifically , of the three pnlf sne  ia calibrators , one ( sn 1992a ) appears to be genuinely sub - luminous for its decline rate .",
    "if we were to arbitrarily eliminate this sn from our hubble constant calculation , the bvi h@xmath4 estimate from pnlf would decrease by  3% , but it would then be based on only two sne . more calibrators with pnlf distances",
    "are clearly needed to say something more definitive .",
    "the difference between the pnlf and sbf values of h@xmath4 is also of fairly low significance . in this case , however , we might have expected a difference based on the fact that sbf distance moduli are , on average , 0.18 @xmath5 0.05 larger than pnlf moduli (  7.3 ) , even when both are put on the freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) scale .",
    "the pnlf and sbf methods react in opposite directions to reddening , and even a small amount of unaccounted internal extinction in the bulges of the calibrating spirals can lead to a large discrepancy in the derived distances . if both techniques are affected , then @xmath103 @xcite . to account for",
    "the @xmath12 5% difference in the hubble constants derived via the sbf and pnlf methods would require e(b - v ) @xmath96 0.02 of unaccounted internal reddening .",
    "given the @xmath104% uncertainty in determining galactic foreground reddening @xcite , and the @xmath105% uncertainty in determining extinction in large - scale dust features of elliptical galaxies @xcite , this small amount of internal extinction is quite plausible .",
    "however , thus far we have only discussed internal errors between the three distance indicators . as has been well known for decades ,",
    "the external systematic errors often dominate the uncertainties in the hubble constant .",
    "we now briefly investigate some of the more recent systematic adjustments to the extragalactic distance scale relevant to sne  ia .",
    "in particular , @xcite have provided an updated calibration of the hubble constant using sne ia with host galaxy cepheid distances .",
    "besides adding two new calibrators ( sn 1994ae and sn 1998aq ) , the primary differences between the @xcite and the @xcite calibrations are : 1 ) application of a metallicity correction to the cepheid distance scale and 2 ) an improved period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation , 3 ) elimination of poorly observed , highly reddened , and/or peculiar sne . @xcite",
    "apply a metallicity correction to the measured cepheid distance moduli of -0.24 mag / dex , whereas the @xcite distance moduli do not include a metallicity correction . in the case of the p - l relation ,",
    "@xcite use the ogle result for the lmc , whereas @xcite use the ogle relation truncated at periods below 10 days .    these changes ,",
    "if correct , can have a significant effect on the hubble constant derived from sne  ia .",
    "@xcite estimate the effect of invoking the metallicity correction to be a 4% decrease in h@xmath4 . to investigate the effects of this new calibration",
    ", we looked at the effects on the absolute magnitude cutoff of the pnlf , @xmath42 , for the pnlf relation assuming the same cepheid calibrators used by @xcite , but correcting these for metallicity as per @xcite . if we take these corrections at face value , we find that @xmath42 became brighter by up to 0.10 mag , implying a hubble constant that is 5% smaller , in good agreement with the @xcite estimate",
    ". the second effect of the different p - l relation is estimated by @xcite to lead to a 2% decrease in h@xmath4 . to make this correction rigorously",
    ", we would have to independently re - fit the p - l relations for the galaxies that provide the cepheid calibration for the pnlf .",
    "since this appears to be a small effect , we will simply adopt the @xcite estimate and apply it to the pnlf distances as well .",
    "adopting these two modifications to our distance scales give h@xmath4 = 72 @xmath5 3 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the cepheid calibrators , h@xmath4 = 72 @xmath5 2 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the sbf , and h@xmath4 = 77 @xmath5 3 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the pnlf ( internal errors only ) .",
    "the cepheid results compares well with the @xcite value of 73 @xmath5 4 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 .",
    "this is as expected , since we used the same four calibrators and assumed the same distance moduli .",
    "the small difference is due to differences in the methods used for calculating the distances of sne ia from their light curves .",
    "we now estimate the systematic errors in these three measurements . for the cepheid distance scale , we apply the three systematic effects adopted by @xcite : 1 ) the lmc distance modulus uncertainty ( 0.10 mag ) , 2 ) the error on the slope of the revised p - l relation ( 0.05 mag ) , and 3 ) the systematic error of the fit to the ridgeline of the gold sample ( 0.025 mag ) .",
    "therefore , the cepheid distance scale gives a systematic error of 0.115 mag , or about 5% in the value of h@xmath4 .",
    "for the pnlf distance indicator , we must add in another systematic term in quadrature , the observational error in determining m@xmath106 ( 0.03 mag ) , and for the sbf an estimate of the errors in the sbf slope ( about 0.03 mag ) .",
    "however , when these are combined in quadrature with the previous systematic effects , they are effectively negligible .",
    "the final results become h@xmath4 = 72 @xmath5 3 ( random ) @xmath5 5 ( systematic ) km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the cepheid calibrators , h@xmath4 = 72 @xmath5 2 ( random ) @xmath5 5 ( systematic ) km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the sbf , and h@xmath4 = 77 @xmath5 3 ( random ) @xmath5 5 ( systematic ) km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the pnlf .",

    "if we take these estimated values of the hubble constant , and compare them with the three year results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , we find a reassuring agreement . assuming a power - law flat @xmath107cdm model , spergel et  al .",

    "non - standard cosmologies such as positively curved models without a cosmological constant are consistent with wmap results and can have hubble constants as low as h@xmath4 = @xmath109 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6(spergel et  al .",
    "2006 ) . however , these non - standard cosmologies are disfavored for a number of reasons , including the constraints from high redshift sne  ia results @xcite , that strongly imply a flat universe .",
    "more realistically , we can compare the wmap three - year results with joint constraints from other observations or assuming inflationary models .",

    "2006 ) .    in conclusion , from the evidence",
    "to date , it appears that absolute magnitudes of sne  ia appear to be broadly consistent , over a range of decline rates . if we were to assume that the differences in our derived hubble constants were solely due to some systematic effect of sne  ia , it would imply a difference of no more than @xmath113 in luminosity .",
    "this is unlikely , as there may be additional systematic effects in the cepheid , sbf , and pnlf distance scales at the few percent level .",
    "however , the case of sn  1992a , which appears to be @xmath99 0.4 magnitudes fainter than most other sne  ia at the same decline rate , may be a signal for additional complexity in the absolute magnitudes of sne  ia .",
    "we stress that these results are still tentative , due to the small number of calibrators , and the limited overlap between the cepheid , sbf , and pnlf distance indicators . as the number of modern observations of type  ia sne increases , and additional distances",

    "there are a number of observations that can improve the results presented in this paper .",

    "these observations would confirm or deny the presence of contaminating objects in a straightforward fashion . in the case of ngc  1316",
    ", spectroscopic observations would clearly distinguish between lyman-@xmath17 galaxies and genuine plantetaries by the width of the spectral lines , and the presence or absence of the [ o  iii ] @xmath114 spectral line , which should be present in all genuine planetaries .",
    "in the case of ngc  4526 , it is extremely unlikely that intracluster planetaries will follow the rotation curve expected for genuine galaxy pne .",
    "ultimately , however , more high - precision distances to galaxies that host high - quality supernovae will allow us to determine the hubble constant to the precision expected .",

    "<S> we detected a total of 45 planetary nebulae candidates in ngc  1316 , 44 candidates in ngc  1380 , and 94 candidates in ngc  4526 . from these data , and the empirical planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) , we derive distances of @xmath1  mpc , @xmath2  mpc , and @xmath3  mpc respectively . our derived distance to ngc  4526 has a lower precision due to the likely presence of virgo intracluster planetary nebulae in the foreground of this galaxy . in ngc  524 and </S>",
    "<S> ngc  1448 we detected no planetary nebulae candidates down to the limiting magnitudes of our observations . </S>",
    "<S> we present a formalism for setting realistic distance limits in these two cases , and derive robust lower limits of 20.9  mpc and 15.8  mpc , respectively .    after combining these results with other distances from the pnlf , cepheid , and surface brightness fluctuations distance indicators </S>",
    "<S> , we calibrate the optical and near - infrared relations for supernovae type  ia and we find that the hubble constants derived from each of the three methods are broadly consistent , implying that the properties of supernovae type  ia do not vary drastically as a function of stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> we determine a preliminary hubble constant of h@xmath4 = 77 @xmath5 3 ( random ) @xmath5 5 ( systematic ) km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6for the pnlf , though more nearby galaxies with high - quality observations are clearly needed . </S>"
