    "the elastic behavior of polyelectrolyte networks is not understood .",
    "the main reason is the lack of knowledge in the interplay between the elastic part @xmath1 of the free energy and the part form the interactions @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest approximation to overcome this problem is the application of the flory - rehner - hypothesis ( frh ) which suggests that both parts of the free energy can be added @xcite .",
    "therefore the thermodynamic behavior of the network is then determined by the minimum of the total free energy @xmath3 .",
    "this procedure must be wrong in general as pointed out by ball and edwards @xcite .",
    "the first reason is purely energetic .",
    "if the partition function is formulated by using the edwards technique ( see @xcite for a review ) , it must be expected that a cross term between both contributions exists . on the other hand",
    "it was shown recently that for realistic networks with fractal structural units , `` left overs '' from the network formation processes yield immediately a violation of the fr - hypothesis @xcite .",
    "these results have been shown by analytical considerations and by numerical simulations .",
    "clearly the violation of the frh was here shown to have purely structural reasons and it can be argued that for perfect networks the frh should hold , as it was believed to be confirmed by many experimental work @xcite on neutral networks and conventional rubbers upon welling experiments .",
    "indeed it is difficult to say anything on the validity of the frh in swelling of conventional rubbers .",
    "real rubber samples can not be characterized as they should be and only indirect measurements such as neutron scattering @xcite can give some hints , but the conclusions in favor or against the frh seem to be vague . for a clear statement on the validity of the frh",
    ", classical rubbers suffer from the fact that the interactions in these systems are weak .",
    "the interactions are `` only '' excluded volume forces and the corresponding potential is very short ranged .",
    "the short ranged excluded volume potential means that flory huggins type , or random phase approximations ( see for example @xcite ) work very well .",
    "however , the excluded volume interactions are weak and thus their effect on the elastic properties is indeed difficult to study with swelling experiments only .",
    "polyelectrolyte networks do not suffer from the lack of weak interactions .",
    "moreover the range of the interaction can be changed during experiments",
    ". very often the interaction between chain segments are described by a debye - hckel potential of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the spatial distance between two segments and @xmath6 the debye screening parameter , which depends mainly on the total ionization @xmath7 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the latter means that the total ionization can be changed easily by adding and removing salt to / from the solution .",
    "the range and the effect of the interactions can be changed easily .",
    "large ionization @xmath7 corresponds a high concentration of salt and thus to large values of @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the interaction potential can be safely modeled by a short ranged form , in some sense with an excluded volume type potential with a certain value determined by the bjerrum length and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the more interesting case is therefore the regime of small values of the debye screening parameter corresponding to long range potentials .",
    "this is the regime discussed below in more detail",
    ".    we will show below systematically that the frh is not applicable to the case of polyelectrolyte networks .",
    "to do so we first derivate the flory - rehner hypothesis . then to make the paper self contained we start with the computation of the deformation of a single polyelectrolyte chain , though some progress has already been achieved @xcite by the application of blob - pictures @xcite",
    "indeed these ideas have been also applied to networks @xcite .",
    "the problem is here is that the such obtained results are based on single chain approaches .",
    "therefore these results are restricted to cases where either the meshes are largely stretched , or the electrostatic interactions are screened .",
    "these two cases are reflected on the ratio of the screening length and the chain size , i.e. , @xmath9 much larger than the mean mesh size radius the network or vice versa . in the latter",
    "the network behaves almost as a classical swollen network , whereas the first case corresponds to the strong polyelectrolyte regime @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will also present a theory beyond these two extreme regimes .",
    "moreover we will leave in the following the single mesh approximation and study a network composed by many meshes .",
    "then we can not rely on the extreme cases @xmath6 large or small ..",
    "our results will show that there is a strong interplay between the elastic force and the interactions .",
    "the force extension relationship is in contrast to neutral gaussian chains not only dependent on the chain length and temperature @xcite but also a strong effect on the single chain modulus from the electrostatic interaction appears @xcite .",
    "this method will be generalized to polyelectrolyte networks @xcite .",
    "we show below that the elastic modulus is a combination of both contributions , i.e. , the classical elastic part , determined by crosslinks only @xcite and a new part coming from the interactions .",
    "thus the modulus is determined strongly by the strength and the range of the interaction .",
    "note that this is not the case for neutral networks .",
    "all computations for excluded volume networks so far show , that the modulus is determined by the number of crosslinks only @xcite . in the third main part of the paper we use the single chain results to study the swelling behavior of polyelectrolyte networks .",
    "before we proceed we present a mathematical formulation of the origin of the frh to show what has to be done to go beyond the classical theories .",
    "we consider a polyelectrolyte network in solvent containing @xmath10 indistinguishable counter - ions .",

    "are finite .",
    "the lowest value for the wave vector is then of the order of @xmath55 which acts as a cut off for small wave vectors .",
    "thus divergences are prevented .    if fluctuations are neglected the only contribution to the partition function stems from @xmath56 . in this case",

    "( [ frh14 ] ) , which is written in brackets , contains the elastic free energy .",
    "the second term represents the translational entropy of the counterions and the last three terms are interaction parts .",
    "this equation indicates , that neglecting fluctuations the free energy is just a sum of an elastic , an entropic and an interaction part @xmath59 .",
    "this reflects the flory - rehner hypothesis .",
    "it shows up only on the limit @xmath60 . below",
    "we will show that this is not all all sufficient .",
    "in general fluctuations can not be neglected . in the present network case fluctuations",
    "have a strong effect : they violate the flory - rehner hypothesis and renormalize the gaussian elasticity .",
    "if the free energy is calculated without neglecting the fluctuations one has to integrate over all @xmath61 and @xmath62 by performing the path integrals .",
    "( [ frh10 ] ) shows that in this case there will be a strong coupling between the elastic and the interaction part of the free energy . even in a debye - hckel approximation ,",
    "i.e. @xmath63 this coupling can not be avoided . in the following sections we show , that in polyelectrolyte networks there is a coupling between the elastic and the interaction part and",
    "thus the flory - rehner hypothesis is no longer applicable .",
    "to approach the problem of elasticity in polyelectrolyte networks on a systematic basis we recall the results of the single chain deformation .",
    "this section will introduce the mathematical method and - more important - it will be shown that the force - extension relationship is fundamentally changed from what is known in gaussian and excluded volume chains .",
    "the deformation of the end - to end - distance of a gaussian chain by an external force @xmath64 is simply described by @xmath65 where @xmath27 is the temperature , @xmath19 the kuhn length , @xmath66 the chain length and @xmath5 the distance of the chain ends .",
    "this result can be easily derived from the gaussian statistics of the ideal chain @xcite .",
    "already when excluded volume forces are taken into account eq.([sc1 ] ) is changed in a fundamental way .",
    "excluded volume force change the statistical behavior of the chain , i.e. , the size if the chain is given by @xmath67 .",
    "thus the single chain is swollen , and another stretching law is expected .",
    "this problem was solved by pincus @xcite .",
    "the result is briefly quoted .",
    "the problem is no longer isotropic and the force has two components , i.e. , parallel to the stretching direction and perpendicular to the stretching direction . at low deformation a hookian deformation behavior",
    "is expected , whereas at larger deformations the self avoiding statistics comes into play . in the low deformation regime the result is @xmath68 and in the limit @xmath69 @xmath70 for the elongation in parallel direction to the force @xmath71 . for the perpendicular direction it is found ( @xmath72 ) @xmath73 a similar situation will occur in the case of polyelectrolyte chains .",
    "the coupling between elasticity and interactions will become much stronger .",
    "the interactions are very strong and pre - stretch the chain to a large extend .",
    "thus it is instructive to study the elastic behavior of single polyelectrolytes .",

    "assuming a replica symmetry this procedure leads to the following self - consistent equation for @xmath164 @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "this equation has to be solved approximately . in analogy to the calculations on the single chain @xcite",
    "we restrict ourselves to small external forces applied on the ends of the crosslinked chain .",
    "therefore we make the same ansatz for the proper - self energy as in the case of the single chain .",
    "the only difference is that the proper self energy in this paper is a function depending on the replica - space wave vector @xmath167 : @xmath168 in the limit of a weakly charged network and in the long ranged limit of the debye - hckel potential the result of the self - consistency calculation according to eq .",

    "( [ ft1a ] ) . the monomer chemical potential and the fugacity of cross - links which parameterize the grand canonical partition function in eq .",
    "( [ erg1 ] ) , should be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath140 . according to panyukov and rabin @xcite the expression @xmath176",
    "can be calculated by the method of steepest descent in the thermodynamic limit @xmath177 : @xmath178 consequently the fugacity @xmath154 of cross - links and the chemical potential @xmath119 of monomers can be obtained by minimizing the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ erg2 ] ) : @xmath179 and @xmath180 in the limit of a vanishing replica index @xmath146 . in the weakly charged limit of the network and in the long - ranged limit of the debye - hckel potential",
    "the result for @xmath119 and @xmath154 is : @xmath181 and @xmath182 moreover it can be shown @xcite , that the conformational free energy of the network is given by : @xmath183 if the free energy @xmath137 is known the force - size relationship is the simply calculated by the derivative of @xmath137 with respect to the external force @xmath64 : @xmath184 after having inserted the results for @xmath154 and @xmath119 in the force size relationship , expanded for small charges @xmath30 neglecting terms of order @xmath185 and higher , since only weakly charged networks are stable , and considered only terms of leading order with respect to small @xmath6 the force - size relationship reads : @xmath186 this is again the result for the small deformation regime .",
    "the result describes a hookian law for the force extension relation and defines the elastic modulus of the polyelectrolyte network .",
    "note further that this result is valid for small forces , i.e. @xmath128 . therefore the modulus for the small screening and the low deformation regime of the network reads : @xmath187 the modulus depends on the density of the crosslink and on the debye screening parameter .",
    "thus both contributions enter in a significant way .",
    "most important is that part of the modulus stemming from the interactions depends on the crosslink density @xmath188 squared .",
    "this now indicates that in the case of strongly interacting soft materials the frh is no longer applicable .",
    "the modulus computed here is a strong combination of both contributions .",
    "moreover we stress that the result is beyond perturbation theory and rpa - type approximations in contrast to earlier suggestions published previously @xcite .",
    "the author in this paper suggests a modulus which is not changed by the interactions .",
    "let us finally discuss the consequences of the above results to the swelling behavior of a simple polyelectrolyte network .",
    "the general theory of swelling for these systems is not simple and will be studied in a subsequent publication .",
    "nevertheless we have a good basis to study the general swelling behavior of polyelectrolyte networks .",
    "to do so we assume that the equilibrium swelling is given by the @xmath0 - network @xcite .",
    "the consequence of this assumption is that the single chain behavior can be used for the determination of the degree of swelling .",
    "thus we may restrict ourselves on one mesh of the network , and we can use the single chain behavior studied in the first section of the paper .",
    "of course , we have to neglect complications by the presence of entanglements and topological restrictions .",
    "therefore we can apply the following results only for mesh sizes below typical entanglement lengths .",
    "the strong electrostatic repulsion , however , does not allow for a large degree of topological restrictions , which makes the assumption of no entanglements reasonable . to estimate the equilibrium degree of swelling , we use an ideal @xmath0 - network whose monodisperse meshes consist of chains with @xmath66 monomers .",
    "these chains are connected by the process of endlinking , where the functionality of an end of the chain should be six in three dimensions .",
    "thus in the ideal totally stretched state of the network the end - links are on the lattice points of a simple cubic lattice with the lattice constant @xmath189 .",
    "figure 1 shows such a swollen network in two dimensions .    for long chains",
    "this ideal network is of course not very realistic . on the one",
    "hand entanglements occur , which disturb the ideal structure drastically .",
    "on the other hand two points of the network could be connected , which would be in the ideal , swollen state far away from each other .",
    "if the network , however , is synthesized out of short chains , that means @xmath66 is small , then these defects should occur with a much smaller probability . consequently in this section",
    "we have to restrict ourselves to networks , which are made of very short chains .    in the dry state without having contact to a solvent",
    "the considered network is a dense system of neutral polymers , because counterions are bound to the charges on the polymers . in solvent",
    "some counterions dissociate and as a result we get a screened coulomb interaction between the charges , which swells the network . to describe the swelling of a network correctly , one has to know the complete free energy of all the states between unswollen and swollen .",
    "this means that we have to have a theory that is valid for the network from the unswollen to the swollen state .",
    "as far as we know such a description does not exist by now , because theoretical considerations are only made in special physical limits .",
    "therefore in this section we use the idea of the @xmath0 - network : we compare the volume of the dry and the swollen state of the above mentioned model - network .    the dry state is a dense system of neutral polymers . which means that the remaining excluded volume interaction is screened @xcite .",
    "consequently the average end - to - end distance of such a chain is : @xmath190 we assume that the considered model network is formed in an equilibrium state , where the mean end - to - end distances of the chains obey eq .",
    "( [ neu2 ] ) . in the swollen state",
    "the averaged end - to - end distances of the chains connecting two neighboring endlink - points in the network can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ r4 ] ) and ( [ r5 ] ) . for vanishing external forces",
    "@xmath64 : @xmath191 thus for our model network we can introduce a parameter of swelling @xmath192 defined as @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the volume of the swollen network and @xmath20 is the volume of the unswollen network : @xmath195 here @xmath196 is the number of endlinks @xmath197 divided by the total number of monomers @xmath175 , i. e. the endlink - density . in our case",
    "@xmath198 is the averaged number of monomers per strand .",
    "here we see clearly that in contrast to neutral networks the degree of swelling @xmath192 does not only depend on the crosslink density , but also on the range of the interactions via @xmath6 and therefore the ionization .",
    "a typical dependence on the different quantities is shown in figure 2 .",
    "in this paper we developed different stages of the problem of the elastic behavior of polyelectrolyte networks .",
    "this problem required a new approach and the classical theories for neutral networks can not be used , so far , except in the limit of large salt concentration , i.e. , @xmath199 . in this regime the interaction potential between the segments",
    "is very short ranged and the network behaves roughly as an `` effective excluded volume network '' .",
    "naturally this regime is not very interesting , since no real new insight can be expected @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the small @xmath6 regime is very important and novel theories can be formulated @xcite . in this regime",
    "we found the strong invalidity of the flory - rehner - hypothesis , which states that different parts of the free energy can be added .",
    "the elastic modulus of the network contains both : the entropic part and the interactions .",
    "both seem to show up as two springs in a series . the equilibrium swelling is determined by interactions and crosslink density .",
