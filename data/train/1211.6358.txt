    "the strong plasmonic response of graphene at room temperature is tied up to its optical response , which can be controlled externally in different ways .",
    "the unique features of the optical conductivity of single - layer graphene stem from the dirac - like nature of quasi - particles , @xcite and have been extensively studied in the past few years , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally,@xcite including in the terahertz ( thz ) spectral range.@xcite    indeed graphene holds many promises for cutting edge thz applications,@xcite which would be able to fill the so called _",

    "photons undergo many round trips inside the cavity enhancing the chances of being absorbed by graphene . in case ( v )",
    "the authors consider a photonic crystal made of sio@xmath0/si . in the visible range of the spectrum",
    "the dielectric constants of sio@xmath0 and si differ by more than one order of magnitude and choosing the width of the sio@xmath0/si appropriately it is possible to induce a large photonic band gap in the visible range . combining the presence of the band gap with an initial spacer layer the absorption can be enhanced by a factor of four . in the case studied in ref .",
    "the optical conductivity of graphene is controlled by interband transitions .",
    "although this work@xcite focused on the visible spectrum , there is _ a priori _ no reason why the same principle can not be extended to the thz .",
    "the physics of surface plasmon - polaritons in graphene has also been explored for the development of devices for optoelectronic applications.@xcite such devices include optical switches @xcite and polarizers.@xcite it has been shown that metallic single - wall carbon nanotubes , which have a linear spectrum close to zero energy , can act as polarizers as well .",
    "@xcite theoretical studies of the optical response of graphene under intense thz radiation has also been performed.@xcite    in general , the conductivity of graphene is a sum of two contributions : ( i ) a drude  type term , describing intraband processes and ( ii ) a term describing interband transitions . at zero temperature",

[ fig_square ] .",

    "we will show that maxwell s equations can be put in a form equivalent to the schrdinger equation for the kronig - penney model , and hence an exact solution for the fields in the region of the grooves is possible .",

[ sec_inho ] , where a simplified model is analysed ) .",
    "nevertheless , the results of ref .   show that a position dependent conductivity alone already induces surface plasmon - polaritons on graphene .",
    "therefore , a spatially modulated optical response , when combined with a grating , will enhance the excitation of surface plasmon - polaritons , as confirmed by the analysis given in sec .",

    "clearly , experimental setups can be designed as to overcome ( at least partially ) such effects e.g. ,  by filling the grooves with a different dielectric and using a top gate or a chemically doped graphene . however , in the bottom gate configuration , even with filled grooves , graphene will have a position dependent conductivity .",
