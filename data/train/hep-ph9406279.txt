    "this is in contrast to the case of @xmath150 decay .",
    "this apparently big difference can be understood from kinematics .",
    "as explained in section 2 we have obtained the averaged total decay rate by deforming the integration contour ( from @xmath151 to @xmath66 in fig.1 ) .",

    "the instanton contribution is evaluated at this scale . as calculated in section 3 ,",
    "the contribution is @xmath156 .    in @xmath9",
    "decay the radius of the deformed contour is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159  @xcite .",
    "the off - shell invariant mass - squared of the final hadrons is equal to @xmath160 .",
    "as long as @xmath161 we can calculate the averaged decay rate using perturbation theory . however unlike the @xmath152 case the radius @xmath95 depends on how the momentum transferred to the leptonic system is distributed between the electron and the anti - neutrino .",
    "in particular @xmath95 vanishes at the boundaries of the phase space .",
    "therefore the instanton contribution evaluated at the scale @xmath160 grows rapidly near the boundaries @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "this means that it is impossible to avoid the resonance region unless we introduce a model - dependent cut near the boundaries of the phase space .",
    "note that the dependence of the off - shell invariant mass - squared of the final hadrons on the kinematic variables arises only when there are more than one `` nonhadronic '' particle in the final state . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to compare our result with the inclusive hadronic @xmath2 decay @xmath164  @xcite . in this case",
    "the neutrino plays the same role as the photon in the @xmath152 decay as far as the kinematics is concerned .",
    "the maximum invariant mass - squared @xmath165 of the final hadrons is fixed at @xmath166 independent of the neutrino energy . since",
    "this is much larger than @xmath167 the total inclusive decay rate can be calculated reliably using the deformed contour . while the specific kinematic variables under consideration are different , the analytic structure and the fact that the maximal invariant mass - squared of the final hadrons is independent of other kinematic variables are similar in both @xmath10 and inclusive hadronic @xmath2 decays .",
    "indeed the instanton contributions are small in both cases .",

    "the fact that both have the same mass dependence and similar numerical factors confirms our expectation .    by the same argument",
    "we expect the instanton contribution to the @xmath172 decay rate is similar to that of the @xmath9 because kinematics and the analytic structure of the forward compton scattering amplitudes are the same .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the instanton effect on the decay rate of @xmath0 . unlike @xmath173 decay",
    "we have found that the instanton correction is negligibly small .",
    "we have also observed that the kinematics and the analytic structure in this case is quite similar to the inclusive hadronic @xmath2 decay , in which the instanton correction is also small .",
    "it is interesting to note that the contribution of nonperturbative effects like instantons depends on kinematics .",
    "it depends on whether kinematics allows to choose a contour in the complex plane of the relevant variables to avoid the resonance region and to use perturbation theory reliably . in the inclusive semileptonic",
    "@xmath3 decay it is impossible to choose a deformed contour to avoid the resonance region .",
    "therefore we need a smearing prescription which limits the theoretical prediction in a model - independent way .    when we probe new physics from the radiative inclusive @xmath3 decay , it is therefore sufficient to examine only those corrections coming from the hadronic matrix elements and the radiative qcd corrections .",
    "the latter part is @xmath174 of the parton - model result . on the other hand since the qcd coupling",
    "constant is sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath175 at one - loop order , it is necessary to set the scale @xmath175 precisely .",
