    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted intense interest due to the high potential to work as basic device units for photonics , spintronics , quantum communication and computation.@xcite one of the applications is to use qds as emitter of single photon@xcite and entangled photon pairs@xcite via the combination of exciton and biexciton .",
    "explicitly , for a symmetric qd , the decay of the bright ( optically active ) exciton states@xcite with total angular momentum projections @xmath1 can emit @xmath2 circularly polarized photons , while that of the biexciton states through two intermediate degenerate bright exciton states can generate two entangled photons.@xcite the asymmetry of qds lifts the degeneracy of the two bright exciton states and mixes them into two states that generate linearly polarized photons with orthogonal polarizations during the decay.@xcite this is even crucial when considering the biexciton decay as the splitting of the intermediate exciton states makes the two channels distinguishable and hence destroys the entanglement.@xcite moreover , the dark ( optically forbidden ) exciton states which lie slightly below the bright ones@xcite are considered promising candidates for spin qubits due to their long lifetimes when confined in qds.@xcite they also play a key role for the bose - einstein condensation in semiconductors.@xcite    the splitting between the bright and dark exciton states ( denoted as the bd exchange splitting hereafter)@xcite and that between the bright exciton states ( denoted as the doublet splitting hereafter)@xcite are mainly controlled by the electron - hole ( e - h ) exchange interaction together with the dot size and asymmetry.@xcite so a detailed understanding of the e - h exchange interaction and the resulting exciton fine structure in qds is of fundamental importance for both theoretical and application purposes .",
    "the e - h exchange interaction has been investigated ever since the 1960s .",
    "it can be decomposed into long- and short - range parts in the real space@xcite or the analytical and nonanalytical parts in the @xmath3 space.@xcite there is a close correspondence between them which can be found in ref .  , and sometimes no difference is made between these two approaches.@xcite    early investigations on the e - h exchange interaction mainly focus on the bulk system.@xcite it is well known that , when considering the exciton states in semiconductors by taking into account the conduction band @xmath4 and the valence band @xmath5 , the short - range ( sr ) exchange interaction splits the eightfold - degenerate exciton state into a triplet bright state and a quintuplet dark state with the splitting energy between them , the so - called exchange energy.@xcite the long - range ( lr ) exchange interaction further splits the triplet into a longitudinal and two transverse modes , the energy difference of which is denoted as the longitudinal - transverse splitting.@xcite the e - h exchange interaction , as well as the direct coulomb interaction , is greatly enhanced by the quantum confinements in low - dimensional semiconductor structures because of the increased spatial overlap between the electron and hole wave functions .",
    "reexamination of the e - h exchange interaction in low - dimensional structures was intrigued in both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite ways .",
    "most of the theoretical works were carried out within the framework of the envelope - function approximation together with the effective - mass approximation.@xcite in general , due to the different effective masses of the heavy , light and split - off holes , the heavy- , light- and split - off - hole exciton states@xcite are energetically split when a quantum confinement is applied . for common cubic iii - v semiconductors , the heavy - hole exciton which energetically lies the lowest is of most physical interest and is hence mostly investigated.@xcite the heavy - hole exciton quartet , which is characterized by the total angular momentum projections @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is split into bright and dark exciton states with @xmath6 and @xmath8 , respectively , by the e - h exchange interaction and the bright exciton states @xmath9",
    "are further split under anisotropic confinement potential .",
    "et al_.@xcite calculated the exchange energy and the bd exchange splitting in gaas/@xmath10 quantum wells ( qws ) and evidenced the enhancement of the exchange effect with decreasing well width .",
    "their work was based on the approximation of decoupled heavy- and light - hole subbands .",
    "andreani and bassani investigated the @xmath3 dependence of the e - h exchange interaction in qw systems.@xcite in ref .",
    "the exciton spin dynamics in gaas qws was studied with e - h exchange interaction as an effective spin - flip mechanism , where the matrix elements of the lr exchange interaction were calculated by using the simple heavy - hole exciton ground states while those of the sr exchange interaction were obtained by taking into account the mixing of heavy- and light - hole bands .",
    "takagahara performed systematic studies of exciton states in qds in ref .  .",
    "the exciton binding energy and the lr and sr exchange interactions were investigated using wave functions calculated by the variational method .",
    "the subband mixing induced by the direct coulomb interaction was pointed out to be important . in a later work for gaas qds,@xcite",
    "takagahara derived an eight - band exciton hamiltonian .",
    "the lr exchange interaction , which was attributed to dipole - dipole interaction , was emphasized to be much more important than the sr exchange interaction when concerning the exciton doublet fine structure .",
    "the contradiction of the calculated scaling law of the doublet splitting energy to the theoretical prediction was reported ( also in ref .  ) .",
    "whereas in the latter works by tsitsishvili _ et al_.@xcite the exciton spin relaxation in single asymmetrical qd was studied by taking into account only the sr exchange interaction .",
    "efros _ et al_.@xcite and horodysk _",
    "et al_. in their very recent work@xcite investigated the band - edge exciton states in spherical qds by including only the sr exchange interaction .",
    "but actually , as will be shown in this paper , the lr exchange interaction contributes to the splitting between bright and dark exciton states even in isotropic qds where the doublet splitting energy vanishes .",
    "its contribution to the bd exchange splitting can be comparable with that from the sr exchange interaction . moreover , although the direct coulomb interaction is believed to lead to poor convergence if treated perturbatively when the exciton system is in the weak confinement regime , in a very recent work by kadantsev and hawrylak,@xcite the exciton fine structure in gaas qds was still studied by taking the direct coulomb interaction as perturbation .    thus , even though a lot of works have been done on the e - h exchange interaction induced exciton properties , obvious confusions are still seen in the literature , even for the most investigated in@xmath11ga@xmath12as nanostructures .",
    "the significance of valence - band coupling to the exciton fine structure needs to be evaluated .",
    "the relative importance of the lr and sr exchange interactions to the doublet splitting needs more elaboration , and that to the bd exchange splitting needs to be clarified .",
    "furthermore , the size scaling of the e - h exchange interaction and the influence of the direct coulomb interaction on the exciton fine structure have to be examined and stressed .",
    "works discussed above mainly concern iii - v semiconductor nanostructures based on in@xmath11ga@xmath12as the split - off band of which is far away from the heavy- and light - hole bands.@xcite so the split - off band is always neglected when studying exciton fine structure . however , for cubic gan , whose spin - orbit splitting is small compared to the wide band gap,@xcite no theoretical work has been performed to investigate exciton fine structure so far , nor does the explicit expression of e - h exchange hamiltonian with the effect of split - off band exists in the literature .",
    "it has been proved that in bulk gan , the split - off band is important when considering the spin - orbit coupling.@xcite whether it is still the case when studying the e - h exchange interaction in gan qds needs to be examined .",
    "the exciton spin relaxation is another important subject that strongly affects the quality of applications in information storage and processing based on exciton states in qds.@xcite motivated by recent experimental study of exciton spin orientation in cubic gan / aln qds,@xcite we investigate the behavior of the lr and sr exchange interactions in cubic iii - v semiconductor qds , taking into account all heavy - hole , light - hole and split - off bands .",
    "the spin relaxation between the lowest two bright exciton states in single gan qd is studied after that .    in this paper , in order to explicitly include the effect of the split - off band on the exciton fine structure in cubic gan , gaas and inas qds , the bulk e - h exchange hamiltonian of both lr and sr parts is first derived in the @xmath13 matrix representation .",
    "the derivation is carried out within the framework of the effective - mass approximation.@xcite for systems strongly confined in one direction , e.g. , the qd system with small dot height considered in this paper , we are able to apply the lwdin partitioning method to approximately diagonalize the modified @xmath14 luttinger hamiltonian ( specified in sec .",
    "ii ) for holes to obtain a new `` heavy - hole '' band , which is an admixture of the heavy - hole , light - hole and split - off bands .",
    "in this way , @xmath15 matrix representations of the exciton exchange hamiltonian are constructed by taking the conduction band and the new `` heavy - hole '' band with the effect of valence - band mixing included .",
    "we then apply the effective hamiltonian obtained to investigate the exciton fine structures in cubic iii - v semiconductor qds .",
    "the doublet splitting energy and the bd exchange splitting are calculated and the relative importance of the lr and sr exchange interactions as well as that of the heavy - hole , light - hole and split - off bands are discussed .",
    "the size scalings of the doublet splitting energy and the bd exchange splitting contributed by the lr and the sr exchange interactions are analyzed and explained by the scaling rules established .    due to the fact that the values of the exciton bohr radius in bulk gaas , inas and gan are 14.9  nm , 51.6  nm and 4.8  nm,@xcite respectively , which are comparable or even smaller than the average diameter of the qds in this paper ( given in sec .",
    "iii ) , chosen according to the experiments,@xcite the direct coulomb interaction is too large to be treated perturbatively .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation by taking the direct coulomb interaction and the confinement in an equal footing .",
    "the calculated exciton binding energies are found to be considerably large , markedly enhanced by the confinement .",
    "this contradicts the results in the latest work by kadantsev and hawrylak@xcite and further demonstrates the importance to treat the direct coulomb interaction unperturbatively .",
    "the importance of the direct coulomb interaction to the exciton fine structure is demonstrated . finally , the exciton spin relaxation rates in single gan qds are calculated and long spin relaxation time is obtained .",

    "it is noted that even though the exciton bohr radius in bulk inas is larger than the dot size in our calculation which is in the strong confinement regime according to the criterion commonly used in the literature,@xcite the exciton binding energy is found to be greatly enhanced from the bulk value ( 15  mev in the qd in constrast to 2.1  mev in bulk ) due to the quantum confinement effect and becomes comparable to the level spacing induced by the lateral confinement .",

    "we note that other factors , e.g. , the anisotropic strain , may also affect the doublet splitting energy.@xcite but as shown in our calculation , the dot geometry should play the key role in determining the dependence of the doublet splitting on the exciton recombination energy .",
