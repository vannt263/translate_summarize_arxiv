    "computation of growth rates of microinstabilities in tokamaks is of considerable interest to the controlled fusion community",
    ". often nonlocal analysis of braginskii , gyrokinetic or gyrofluid equations leads us to a system of differential equations or differentio - integral equations with an unknown eigenvalue. such eigenvalue problems are encountered extensively in areas of ballooning modes , drift waves and other microinstabilities .",
    "such equations have usually been solved by the shooting method , integral eigenvalue codes , phase integral methods and so on by a number of authors and refs @xcite-@xcite is certainly an incomplete list .",
    "however shooting methods suffer from a number of disadvantages .",
    "shooting methods are very sensitive to initial conditions",
    ". it may be difficult to arrive at the right answer unless a very good approximation to the correct result is known .",
    "furthermore , if determination the full eigenmode spectrum is intended then the whole 2-d parameter space of initial guesses @xmath0 must be spanned . keeping in mind sensitivity to the initial",
    "guess , this may not be easy .",
    "shooting methods can run into difficulties if the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix are widely separated .",
    "often results are determined by round off errors rather than by the equation itself .",
    "integral eigenvalue codes like those that use methods of delves and lyness or davies method also require initial guesses @xcite .",
    "two methods that overcome many of these disadvantages are the finite difference ( fd ) and spectral collocation methods @xcite .",
    "finite difference methods consist of replacing the derivatives by an approximation ( such as @xmath1/2h$ ] where @xmath2 is the grid size .",
    "this introduces truncation error and accuracy may be compromised ( although a finite difference method is easy to program ) .",
    "higher order finite difference methods impose strong stability restriction .",
    "gary and hegalson @xcite have highlighted the usefulness of difference methods in computing eigenvalues of differential equations .",
    "specifically , it has been pointed out by them that the shooting methods that use muller method or lagurre method may run into difficulties ( see table vi of ref @xcite ) .",
    "spectral methods involve expansion of the solution by a finite sum in a orthogonal basis functions and minimizing of the residual @xcite .",
    "different spectral and pseudospectral methods differ in their minimization strategies . in this manuscript , the use of differentiation matrix ( dm ) based spectral methods to compute the etg growth rate has been illustrated .",
    "differentiation matrix based methods score over finite difference methods in their ease of use , greater accuracy and faster execution for the same matrix size .",
    "the importance of these methods was realized by the author through an informal comparison observed in course of this work : a @xmath3 dm gave similar accuracy as a @xmath4 fd matrix . since computational time scales very fast ( it costs @xmath5 operations for the qz @xcite algorithm ) , the ratio of the time consumed in the fd method ( @xmath6 ) while that in dm ( @xmath7 ) would be @xmath8 ! !",
    "- a huge increase in speed!. it must be noted however , the matrices involved in the dm and fd methods are , respectively , banded and full .",
    "this might make the dm method much more expensive for the same n number .",
    "moreover , the fd performance could probably also be improved by optimizing the non - equidistant grid .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown in this report , etg growth rates converge faster with differentiation matrix methods .",
    "differentiation matrix methods have one more advantage .",
    "the process of differentiation can be done through the matrix - vector product @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a vector of function values at the nodes @xmath11 .",
    "for example consider the model problem @xmath12 which in matrix form becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are a first and second order differentiation matrices respectively .",
    "thus in these methods , the process of differentiation can be carried out through a matrix - vector product .",
    "thus in principle one could create differentiation matrices for the curl or a gradient operator to solve more complex problems .",
    "the application of differentiation matrices is relavant to plasma physics and specifically to toroidal version of drift instabilities employing the ballooning formalism .",
    "it must be pointed out that the goal of this manuscript is not to show that finite difference algorithms are not useful .",
    "in fact , a variety of situations can be envisaged where finite difference algorithms may be indispensible .",
    "furthermore , neither the finite difference algorithm nor the differentiation matrix based methods used here are the very best and therefore a full academic comparison therefore can not be done . since a general analytical solution of the equations discussed here in not available ,",
    "a comparision of numerical solutions from fd and dm methods is used as a means to fill this gap .",
    "the main goal therefore , is to present application of differentiation matrices to linear analysis of ballooning modes . in the present paper , features of the collisionless , linear electromagnetic etg mode@xcite",
    "are investigated used as a specific expample of ballooning type modes .",
    "the etg mode is widely recognized as a mechanism for the small scale turbulence driven electron heat transport in tokamaks .",
    "the etg mode is a short wavelength ( @xmath16 ) , low frequency ( @xmath17 ) fast growing mode ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) driven unstable by temperature and density gradients .",
    "here , @xmath20 is the ion gyroradius , @xmath21 is the electron gyroradius , @xmath22 is the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background density scale length .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ( sec [ etg ] )",
    ", the basic equations of the etg mode will be presented .",
    "an approximate solution in the strong ballooning limit is also derived and approximate eigenvectors computed ( figure [ eigvect ] ) .",

    "comparison is made in three different ways : ( i ) growth , ( ii ) matrix size , and ( iii ) conjugacy of eigenvalues .",
    "next , the problem of determination of the number of eigenvalues is addressed for which the nearest and ordinal distances have been computed .",
    "a summary and conclusions are presented in section [ concl ] .",
    "in this section the fluid description of the etg mode will be discussed and a set of basic equations will be presented . an advanced electron fluid model for the core plasma ( i.e. collisionless plasma ) has been used .",

    "requirement of guess values that makes it no better than shooting methods discussed earlier .",

    ", a finite difference code has been developed to overcome the above shortcomings .",
    "this code has the following advantages not present in the above code : ( i ) generates the full eigenvalue spectrum simultaneously ; ( ii ) there is an option to refine a particular eigenvalue ; and ( ii ) for small changes in a parameter , the changes in a branch can be tracked automatically , otherwise it requires careful human intervention . other salient feature",
    "are : ( i ) can solve complex coupled differentio - algebraic equations ; and ( ii ) arbitrary mesh ( which is necessary and useful since boundary conditions are at infinity and the eigenfunction is expected to be localized ) .",

    "the solid lines indicate analytical result while the solid circles depict the numerical values .",
    "it must also be pointed out that in this figure , the x - axis range has been reduced ( from the actual range used in the computation ) to show that the eigenvectors from the analytical approximation closely follow the numerical result .",

    "thus even for a modest mesh size of 150 points generates two matrices each of size @xmath80 .",
    "investigation of the etg mode requires variation of the basic parameters over a wide range .",
    "for example , for each value of shear parameter @xmath81 and ballooning parameter @xmath82 , safety factor @xmath83 , plasma beta @xmath84 , temperature ratio @xmath85 , eigenvalues for at least @xmath86 values of @xmath87 must be computed .",
    "this large number of values of @xmath87 are used to accurately compute the threshold and this increases the time taken by the computer .",
    "differentiation matrices are novel , powerful methods of finding the eigenvalues of differential equations .",
    "these methods are very accurate . for smooth problems , convergence rates of the order of @xmath88",
    "are often achieved @xcite as compared to finite difference methods where the convergence rate are slower , typically ( @xmath89 ) or ( @xmath90 ) .",

    "the differentiation matrix is then defined as a matrix with the entries : @xmath98_{x = x_k}\\ ] ] the process of differentiation can be done through the matrix - vector product @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a vector of function values at the nodes @xmath11 .",
    "this manuscript , mostly uses the hermite collocation method . in the hermite collocation method , the nodes @xmath99 are the roots of @xmath100 , the hermite polynomial .",

    "the results of computation from finite difference method is shown as solid lines and that from hermite method is shown as circles .",

    "the eigenvalues of the etg mode for different values on n using the finite difference method and hermite spectral collocation method have also been computed . as depicted in figure  ( [ comparison ] ) , the hermite method converges much before the two finite difference methods . in figure  ( [ comparison ] )",

    "the solid line in this figure represents an error level of @xmath123 which is easily achieved by the hermite method .",
    "the error also decreases fastest for the this method .",
    "looking at the basic equations , one realizes that for a particular set of parameters , the maximum growth rate ( @xmath124 ) also has a complex conjugate @xmath125 .",
    "mathematically , one expects that @xmath126 .",
    "this however may not be true in reality .",
    "only one of the two roots may be more accurate than the other .",

    "the hermite method has also been computed .",
    "this is shown in figure [ deltagamma ] where the triangles refer to a hermite calculation while the dots refer to finite difference method .",
    "values from both methods are small but the hermite method appears to be slightly more accurate than finite difference .",
    "it is possible that the slightly smaller inaccuracies of the hermite - case are simply due to a slightly unfavorable ordering in the matrix or round off errors .",
    "it must also be noted that this error is also smaller compared to the error in the approximation schemes .",
    "the system of equations [ fleq ] has three equations in three variables .",
    "increasing n , furthermore , would give us @xmath129 eigenvalues .",
    "for an arbitrary n , increasing to infinity , the number of eigenvalues would also be large .",
    "all of these eigenvalues might not be good approximations to the eigenvalues of the actual differential equation .",
    "physically one expects only a few of these should remain the same for every n. thus it is important to ascertain the number of true eigenvalues of the differential equation at hand .",
    "the following two situations can be envisaged : ( i ) the eigenvalue drifts as n increases .",
    "( ii ) a new ( probably spurious ) eigenvalue is inserted between the two earlier ones . in order to ascertain the correct eigenvalues , boyd _ et .",
