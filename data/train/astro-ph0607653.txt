    "the origin(s ) of the luminous x - ray emission characteristic of low - mass , pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) stars remains the subject of vigorous debate . for weak - lined ( apparently non - accreting ) t tauri stars ,",
    "there is substantial evidence that the x - rays are primarily the result of solar - like coronal activity ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 ; kastner et al .",
    "2004a ) . for certain actively accreting pre - ms stars",
    ", however , the x - ray emission instead appears to arise as a direct consequence of the accretion process itself ( tw hya , kastner et al .",
    "2002 , stelzer & schmitt 2004 ; bp tau , schmitt et al .",
    "these results can not be easily reconciled with the fact that , for the orion nebula cluster , the x - ray luminosities of actively accreting pre - ms stars are somewhat smaller than those of non - accreting pre - ms stars ( flaccomio et al .",

    "chandra x - ray observatory and xmm - newton observations of v1647 ori , obtained both before and just after this pre - ms star in the l1630 dark cloud underwent a spectacular optical / ir outburst ( briceno et al .",

    "2005 , hereafter g05 ) .",
    "these results serve as strong evidence that high - energy emission from young stars can occur as a consequence of high accretion rates .",
    "we have continued to monitor v1647 ori in x - rays with chandra and xmm , and present here the results of observations obtained beginning about one year after the acquisition of the initial , post - outburst x - ray data reported in k04 and g05 .",
    "observations of the l1630 field centered on v1647 ori were obtained on 2005 april 11 , august 27 , december 9 and 14 , and 2006 may 1 with chandra s advanced ccd imaging spectrometer in its imaging ccd readout configuration ( acis - i ) .",
    "exposure times were 18.2 , 19.9 , 19.7 , 18.1 , and 21.7 ks , respectively .",
    "acis has a pixel size of 0.49@xmath0 and the field of view of acis - i is @xmath1 ; the chandra / acis - i combination is sensitive over the energy range @xmath20.310 kev .",
    "v1647 ori was positioned at the standard acis - i aimpoint on front - illuminated ccd i3 during each exposure .",
    "the data were subject to standard processing by the chandra x - ray center pipeline software ( ciao , v.3.1 ; caldb , v.  3.03.2 ) .",
    "count rates for v1647 ori and three nearby field x - ray sources ( table 1 ) were determined by extracting source photons in the energy range 0.5 - 8.0 kev ( to limit background ) within @xmath3 radius circular regions , and then subtracting the area - weighted background count rate within a @xmath4 radius off - source region . for the 2005 april and 2005 august datasets ,",
    "in which v1647 ori is well detected , we also extracted x - ray light curves ( fig.1 ) and pulse height spectra ( fig .",
    "2 ) within the @xmath3 radius circular region centered on the position of the star .",
    "it is apparent from the count rates presented in table 1 that the x - ray source associated with v1647 ori generally faded throughout the period of observations reported here , to the extent that the source was not detected on 2005 dec.and 2006 may 1 ; the detection on 2005 dec .",
    "14 is marginal , with at most four source photons collected .",
    "the three field x - ray sources  all of which are associated with pre - ms stars in the l1630 dark cloud  were readily detected ( though variable in count rate ) throughout this same period ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is furthermore apparent from fig.1 that v1647 ori remained variable on @xmath5 hr timescales during the @xmath6 yr post - outburst x - ray observations reported here ; such rapid x - ray variability was also observed during the first six months post - outburst ( g05 ) .    to assess whether the x - ray spectrum of v1647 ori has changed significantly since our previous post - outburst observations ( k04 ; g05 ) , and to convert the v1647 ori chandra / acis - i x - ray count rates to x - ray fluxes , we performed spectral modeling with xspec ( ver .",
    "we assumed the source spectrum consists of thermal plasma emission ( as represented by the mekal model ; liedahl et al.1995 and references therein ) with a metallicity of 0.8 relative to solar and suffering intervening absorption characterized by @xmath7 @xmath8 ( g05 ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "we find a source plasma with @xmath9 kev best fits the 2005 april data ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath10 is well within the 90% confidence range of the `` hard '' x - ray spectral component determined from modeling of chandra data obtained in march 2004 ( fig .  2 ; k04 ) and xmm data obtained in 2004 april ( g05 ) .",
    "the same plasma model is also consistent with the rather noisy spectrum obtained in 2005 august ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we therefore used this model ( @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath11 kev ; acis - i3 energy conversion factor ecf @xmath12 erg @xmath8 count@xmath13 ) to calculate observed x - ray fluxes ( and x - ray flux upper limits ) from the acis count rates of v1647 ori for all five observations reported here , as well as for the post - outburst 2004 march observations .",
    "the measured median photon energies ( table 1 ) confirm that the v1647 ori x - ray source remained somewhat hard for at least one year post - outburst , relative both to its pre - outburst x - ray emission and to other nearby , pre - ms sources in l1630 .",
    "the median energies provide marginal evidence that the x - ray spectrum of v1647 ori softened after 2005 august , so we adopt the estimated pre - outburst value @xmath14 kev ( k04 ) in converting the 2005 december and 2006 may acis - i3 count rate and upper limit to x - ray flux and flux upper limit , respectively ( adopting the ecf calculated from the 2005 april data would increase both flux values by a factor @xmath15 ) .",
    "these x - ray flux results , and contemporaneous near - infrared fluxes , are compiled in fig .  3 , which also includes previously reported near - infrared and x - ray fluxes .",
    "for consistency with k04 and g05  and with the infrared photometric data , which are not corrected for extinction  values of x - ray flux included in fig .",
    "3 are not corrected for intervening absorption .",
    "for the four chandra and xmm exposures of duration @xmath16 ks in which the mean x - ray flux is @xmath17 erg @xmath8 s@xmath13 , we indicate the range of x - ray flux as measured in 5 ks time bins .",
    "this figure reveals that , subsequent to april 2005 ( j.d .",
    "2,453,400 ) , v1647 ori steeply declined in near - infrared luminosity , such that the object had returned to near pre - outburst levels by late 2005 .",
    "the xmm and chandra / acis - i observations reveal a steady decline in mean x - ray flux from the object over this time period .",
    "we next consider whether the two declines are physically related .",
    "flux variations of a factor @xmath18 were measured in the longer - duration xmm observations of v1647 ori in outburst ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "while the detailed x - ray variations of v1647 ori observed in these longer exposures ( e.g. , g05 ) do not appear typical of x - ray flares from more evolved , low - mass , pre - ms stars , it is important to assess the likelihood that the apparent striking correspondence between the x - ray and near - infrared light curves of v1647 ori over the course of its outburst resulted from random x - ray flaring during the optical / ir eruption .    consider a simplified `` short - term '' ( @xmath19 ks duration ) flaring model in which the x - ray source could be in either of two states  flaring ( `` high '' , mean @xmath20 erg @xmath8 s@xmath13 ) or quiescent ( `` low '' , mean @xmath21 erg @xmath8 s@xmath13 )  with equal probability , during any given chandra or xmm observation .",
    "for 10 random samplings of such a bimodal source , the probability that we would observe the specific sequence of mean source states displayed in fig .  3",
    " low prior to j.d .",
    "2,453,000 , high between j.d .",
    "2,453,000 and 2,453,700 , low again after j.d . 2,453,700  is 1 in @xmath22 , or @xmath23% .",
    "we also constructed a somewhat more sophisticated monte carlo flare model , in which the source is characterized by a specific combination of flare duration and flare duty cycle , each of which are adjustable parameters .",
    "the source state was then determined at irregular temporal sampling intervals matching those of the chandra and xmm observations .",
    "we find that , over a wide range of both flare duration ( 10 ks to 100 ks ) and duty cycle ( 10% to 90% ) , the number of instances in which the model high vs.  low state sequence matches that of the observations is no more than 0.11% of the total number of model sequences .",
    "hence , it is highly unlikely that the apparent coincidence of strongly enhanced and then sharply declining x - ray flux is the chance superposition of shorter - duration x - ray flaring on the longer - term near - infrared flux increase and decline .",
    "herbig ( 1989 ) described eruptive behavior among low - mass , pre - ms stars as either fu orionis - like ( `` fuor '' ; see review by kenyon & hartmann 1996 ) or ex lupi - like ( `` exor '' ) .",
    "such sustained optical / ir outbursts from pre - ms stars are generally interpreted as episodes of rapid accretion ( e.g. , herbig et al .",
    "2001 ; hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) .",
    "there has been much discussion in the recent literature ( e.g. , aspin et al .",
    "2006 ; vig et al .",
    "2006 ; ojha et al .",
    "2006 ; muzerolle et al .  2005 ) as to which accretion burst `` class '' v1647 ori might belong .",
    "based on the near - infrared monitoring results presented in fig .  3 ( see also aspin et al .",
    "2006 ) , it is now apparent that the outburst that began in late 2003 and had ended by late 2005 was an event of much shorter duration than those of `` classical '' fuors , which typically last several decades .",
    "the only other known outburst of v1647 ori during the past 100 yr , which occurred in 1966 - 1967 , was of similar or perhaps somewhat shorter duration ( aspin et al . )",
    ". it therefore appears v1647 ori can not be considered an fuor and , hence , joins the ranks of the candidate exors  which already comprise a rather diverse set of objects in terms of outburst amplitudes , durations , and frequencies",
    ". such a broad spectrum of variability behavior ultimately hints at the presence of a wide range in the rates of accretion onto individual pre - ms stars , as well as a wide range in the rate of _ change _ of these accretion rates .",
    "the increase and subsequent decrease in the infrared flux from v1647 ori ( fig .",
    "3 ) is evidently entirely the result of variations in accretion luminosity , as there has been minimal change in extinction toward the object during its outburst ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ; gibb et al.2006 ) .",
    "specifically , the accretion rate is inferred to have increased from a pre - outburst level of a few @xmath24 @xmath25 yr@xmath13 to @xmath26 @xmath25 yr@xmath13 at outburst onset ( vacca et al .",
    "2004 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "it follows that the rapid decline in the optical / ir luminosity of of v1647 ori in late 2005 was caused by a similarly precipitous drop in accretion rate to near pre - outburst levels .",
    "the measured br - gamma line flux from v1647 ori dropped by a factor @xmath18 between 2005 march and 2006 january ( gibb et al.2006 ; simon , unpublished ) , supporting the interpretation that the accretion rate has declined sharply over this period .    hence , just as the sudden onset of bright x - rays from v1647 ori",
    "was closely coupled to its initial accretion burst ( k04 ) , the recent drop in the x - ray luminosity of v1647 ori is most likely directly coupled to a rapid decline in stellar accretion rate .",
    "the contrast between the relatively small amplitude short - term near - infrared variability of v1647 ori during its 20032005 outburst and its rapid ( hour - timescale ) , large - amplitude x - ray variability over this same period further suggests that whereas the near - infrared continuum is diagnostic of large - scale changes in disk mass and temperature structure ( that , in turn , reflect changes in the time - averaged accretion rate ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2005 ) , the x - rays trace small - scale changes in the star - disk magnetic field configuration that result in the release of magnetic energy .    these results for v1647 ori , like the detection of enhanced x - ray emission from xz tau during an optical / ir outburst from that star ( giardino et al .",
    "2006 ) , strengthen the link between pre - ms accretion and x - ray emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent optical outburst of the exor candidate v1118 ori was accompanied by a _ softening _ of its x - ray spectrum and only modest changes in x - ray luminosity ( audard et al .",
    "2005 ) ; and simultaneous optical and x - ray observations of the orion nebula cluster obtained over a @xmath15-week period indicate that , on timescales of hours to days , optical and x - ray variability is largely uncorrelated ( stassun et al .",
    "neither the v1118 ori nor onc optical / ir outbursts were as intense as that of v1647 ori , and the onc optical flares observed by stassun et al .",
    "are , of course , of far shorter duration .",
    "the foregoing suggests that the duration and intensity of a pre - ms stellar eruption reflects the degree to which the magnetic fields connecting star to disk are reorganized before and during a major accretion event .",
    "the degree of reorganization ( i.e. , the intensity of associated magnetic reconnection events ) then likely determines whether such an accretion event is accompanied by the release of hard x - rays , as opposed to soft x - rays indicative of accretion shocks ( e.g. , kastner et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the unusually hard x - ray spectrum of fu ori itself , with its prominent fe line emission ( skinner , briggs , & gdel 2006 ) , may indicate that this system remains in a volatile state of ongoing star - disk magnetic field reconnection .",
    "additional , long - term , simultaneous x - ray and near - infrared monitoring of eruptive pre - ms stars is essential to establish whether sustained ( exor- or fuor - like ) accretion bursts are commonly accompanied by enhanced hard x - ray emission .",
