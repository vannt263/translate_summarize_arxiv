    "in most cases , when a quantum system interacts with its environment it undergoes decoherence @xcite , to wit , the system - environment interaction `` spoils '' the state of the system by decreasing its capacity for quantum interference , which is essential for standard quantum information processing .",
    "decoherence is so far one of the major obstacles for implementing quantum computation processes in real systems . despite such nuisance",
    ", recent works have shown procedures to manipulate the system - environment interaction or the information leaked to the environment in suitable ways depending on the specific goal : _",
    "e.g. _ , estimation of quantum noise @xcite , protection of coherence and/or entanglement @xcite , universal quantum computation @xcite , quantification of entanglement @xcite and entanglement concentration @xcite .",
    "an interesting study for exploring quantum devices is the experimental simulation of complex dynamics on controllable quantum systems of simple implementation @xcite .",
    "these simulations allow for a better control and , therefore , understanding of the details leading to decoherence as well as the mechanisms underneath the system - environment exchange of excitation and/or information .",
    "recent works on dynamics simulations have been performed in diverse quantum systems such as optical interferometers with polarization - entangled photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite , spin-@xmath0 nuclear states of carbon atoms accessed by magnetic nuclear resonance @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite .    in particular , the simulation of open system dynamics for qubits ( two - level quantum systems ) has already been observed in many different experiments and has been connected to the observation of phenomena such as entanglement sudden death @xcite and non - markovian dynamics @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the extension of a similar analysis to qudits ( d - level quantum systems ) presents both a wider range of phenomena to observe and possible applications to explore ranging from full local protection of entanglement to dynamical precursors of entanglement sudden death that are not present in pair of qubits .",
    "however , the simulation of quantum open systems in qudits is not as easy to implement as in qubits which justifies the rarity of such results in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we report an experimental technique for simulating decoherence in the the dynamics of a qudit .",
    "our qudits are encoded in the transverse component of the linear momentum of photon pairs generated by spdc .",
    "the quantum system is defined in terms of the path entangled photons , namely , down - converted photons propagated through paths outlined by optical diffractive elements ( multi - slits ) @xcite . in particular , we simulate two types of decoherence mechanisms namely dephasing @xcite and amplitude damping @xcite , by means of a spatial light modulator ( slm ) employed to implement operations on the qudit states .",
    "a wide variety of applications extend the use of slms for controlled manipulation of photonic quantum systems encoded , for instance , in polarization @xcite , in orbital angular momentum @xcite or in transverse momenta of the photons @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  [ theory ] we summarize the concepts of open system dynamics ; the state preparation and the dephasing implementation are discussed in sections [ setup ] and [ tdephasing ] , respectively ; section  [ tamplitude ] presents the amplitude damping implementation .",
    "we summarize and conclude the article in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section we present a brief review of the theory of open quantum systems in order to outline this work .",
    "a system ( @xmath1 ) interacting with an environment ( @xmath2 ) is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the system and environment hamiltonian operators , respectively ; @xmath6 is the system - environment coupling hamiltonian , and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the system ( environment ) identity operator .",
    "we can describe only the system evolution by the equation of motion given by @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the total ( @xmath11 ) density operator .",
    "the system evolution for the system - environment coupling can always be expressed as an unitary evolution and the total density matrix can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the density matrix of the initial state . in the particular case where we consider the initial state as a product state between the system and the environment , @xmath15 , the effective evolution of the system",
    "is given by : @xmath16,\\\\ & = & \\sum_\\epsilon ( { _ e}{\\left\\langle \\epsilon \\right| } u_{se}(t){\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle}_e ) \\rho_{se } ( { _ e}{\\left\\langle 0 \\right| } u_{se}^{\\dagger}(t ) { \\left| \\epsilon \\right\\rangle}_e ) \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 form an orthonormal basis for the environment .",
    "this evolution can be expressed only in terms of operators acting on @xmath1 in the following form @xmath18 where the operators @xmath19 are the so - called kraus operators @xcite and define a trace preserving positive map : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "note that the kraus operators are not uniquely defined because there are many bases for describing the environment . as a consequence",
    ", we deal with the equivalent operators from different sets , which originate different decompositions of the same resulting density matrix .    under certain well established circumstances known as the born - markov approximations ,",
    "the evolution of the system can also be expressed in terms of a time continuous master equation , given by @xcite @xmath23 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n^2 - 1}\\gamma_j \\left(a_j\\rho_s a_j^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_s a_j^\\dagger a_j - \\frac{1}{2}a_j^\\dagger a_j\\rho_s\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the system density operator , @xmath25 are the so - called lindblad operators and @xmath26 is a non - negative quantity which has dimensions of the inverse of time if @xmath25 is dimensionless .",
    "the first term on the right side of the master equation represents the unitary part of the dynamics generated by the hamiltonian @xmath4 . in this case , an intuitive set of kraus operators is given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 and terms of the order of @xmath30 are ignored .",
    "this so - called unravelling of the master equation is associated to the quantum trajectories method where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively known as the no - jump and jump operators .",
    "this method is connected both to an alternative way to calculated the evolution of the system on average as well as a direct way to infer its evolution at any single realization where a sequential measurement of the state of the environment is performed .    in this work , as mentioned above , we focus on two types of open quantum system evolution : dephasing and amplitude - damping . in the following sub - sections we outline such evolutions .      in a dephasing dynamics",
    "the system loses coherence due to the system - environment interaction without any population exchange .",
    "this occurs when a noisy environment couples to a system @xcite .",
    "we can describe this dynamics for a system with dimension @xmath33 using the kraus operators @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the identity operator for a system of dimension @xmath33 .",
    "the system evolution in a dephasing dynamics can be obtained from @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the set of time dependent parameters that represent the weight of each kraus operator .",
    "writing the system density operator in a matrix form such that @xmath39 , the dynamics for each matrix density element can be obtained .",
    "the diagonal elements are constant , @xmath40 and the off - diagonals elements evolve as @xmath41 showing the system decoherence . the experimental implementation can be simplified if we consider the particular case @xmath42 for @xmath43 , inducing a single - parameter dependence in the system evolution .",
    "thus , the off diagonals elements are @xmath44 dephasing dynamics implementation is presented in section [ tdephasing ] .",
    "damping dynamics represents the dissipative interaction between the system and its environment .",
    "a common example is the loss of photons from a cavity into a zero - temperature environment of electromagnetic - field modes  @xcite .",
    "this dynamics can be described using the master equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the operator annihilation ( creation ) of a photon inside the cavity and @xmath48 is the decay rate inside the cavity .",
    "one approach to describe the system dynamics is based on the theory of quantum trajectories @xcite , which consist in monitoring the system s environment .",
    "environmental monitoring during a time interval @xmath49 indicates whether or not a loss of excitation ( a quantum jump ) can occur .",
    "if no loss of excitation occurs , the system evolves without a quantum jump ; thus , this evolution is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , if the system loses an excitation , the system evolves with a quantum jump @xmath52 where @xmath53 $ ] is the probability that a quantum jump occurs within the time interval .",
    "note that , the higher the excitation in the cavity , the greater the chance of a quantum jump occurs , @xmath54=\\delta t \\gamma n$ ] , where @xmath55 is the photon number state inside the cavity .    in section [ tamplitude ]",
    "we demonstrate a partial dynamics of this open system : the no - jump trajectories .",
    "such interesting dynamics occurs when the evolution exhibits no jump at all .",
    "in this section we describe the setup for simulating experimentally dephasing and damping dynamics on qudits .",
    "the experimental setup is illustrated in figure  [ setup1 ] .",
    "a @xmath56  mw solid state laser operating at @xmath57  nm pumps a @xmath58  mm thick type",
    "i bibo crystal ( bib@xmath59o@xmath60 ) and creates degenerate non - collinear photon pairs with horizontal polarization .",
    "a dichroic mirror placed after the crystal reflects the pump beam out of the setup and transmits the photon pairs .",
    "signal ( @xmath61 ) and idler ( @xmath62 ) photons ( @xmath63 nm ) are transmitted through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) before crossing a multi - slit array placed perpendicularly to the propagation axis of the pump beam at a distance of @xmath64  mm from the crystal .",
    "taking the pump beam direction as the @xmath65 longitudinal axis , the multi - slit plane lies in the @xmath66 transverse plane .",
    "the slits are @xmath67  mm wide and have a center - to - center separation of @xmath68  mm .",
    "a @xmath69  mm focal length lens @xmath70 placed @xmath71  mm before the crystal is used for focusing the pump beam at the multi - slit array plane .",
    "when the beam waist at this plane is smaller than the separation between the slits , the spatial part of the two - photon state after crossing the aperture will be given by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the number of slits , and @xmath75 is the so - called signal ( idler ) slit state or photon path state . at this point ,",
    "a maximally path entangled state is prepared .",
    "focuses the pumping beam at the multi - slit plane , generating the state given by equation [ expstate ] after the multiple slit @xcite .",
    "the slm1 , together with a pbs and the multi - slit can generate partially entangled states . to perform the dephasing dynamics , a spherical lens @xmath76 is placed in the configuration @xmath77 , creating a multi - slit image on the slm2 plane .",
    "a beam splitter ( bs ) depicted in dotted line is not used for this implementation . on the amplitude damping dynamics , a cylindrical lens is used to project the image at an infinite distance , instead of the lens @xmath76 . in order to realize the damping operations , we place the bs ( dotted line ) to construct a sagnac interferometer .",
    "the lenses @xmath78 and @xmath79 are used to create an image or interference pattern according to their positions at the focal plane .",
    "we use a half wave plate ( hwp ) to rotate the polarization of signal photons because the slm2 modules only horizontal polarization.,width=340 ]    now , we describe how we prepare a path state with any degree of entanglement . a holoeye lc - r 2500 spatial light modulator , depicted as slm1 in figure  [ setup1 ] , is positioned just behind the multi - slit array , at a distance of @xmath801  mm , to prevent diffraction .",
    "the slm1 display is split horizontally into two sections , one for signal and the other for idler photon ; independently , each section is addressed with a multi - slit aperture with different gray levels ( see the lower inset of figure  [ setup1 ] ) .",
    "a particular gray level is associated with a specific change in the polarization of the incoming photons .",
    "when the photons are reflected back by the slm1 , a pbs is used to filter them , selecting only their vertical polarization components . at the vertical output port of the pbs",
    ", the photon states get different modulation in each slit as they reach different gray levels at the slm1 display .",
    "thus , the slm1 can be used to produce a partially entangled state , accordingly to the required application @xcite . in the following sections , we present the dynamics implementation .",
    "we characterize a ququart photonic path state under the dephasing dynamics .",
    "ququart states are prepared by placing a four - slit in front of slm1 , perpendicular to the photon pair path ( figure [ setup1 ] ) . in this",
    "particular dynamics , the slm1 does not change the initial ququart state which is given by equation [ expstate ] . on the idler arm ,",
    "the idler photon passes through the lens @xmath78 , with a focal length of @xmath81 mm , that projects the interference pattern at the detector 2 plane . on the signal arm ,",
    "the signal photon passes through @xmath76 , with a focal length of @xmath82 mm , which is positioned in the configuration @xmath77 with the slm2 plane .",
    "this configuration allows to create the multi - slit image on the slm2 screen .",
    "the sml2 model is a hamamatsu lcos - slm x10468 which is used to perform the dephasing .",
    "the slm2 display is addressed with four rectangular regions ( see upper inset of figure [ setup1 ] ) , each one matching a given slit @xmath83 from the four - slit array .",
    "each gray level region modulates a phase @xmath84 and performs the dephasing operations @xmath85 independently . under this implementation ,",
    "the bs is not present .",
    "the lens @xmath79 , with a focal length of @xmath81 mm projects the interference pattern on the detector 1 plane .",
    "any operation required to implement the dephasing dynamics is performed by the slm2 .",
    "let us consider the state @xmath24 that describes an ensemble with @xmath86 components .",
    "when the dephasing occurs , the constituent @xmath87 evolves according to the operator @xmath88 ( see equation [ pspi ] ) , with @xmath89 . in order to implement this dynamics in our experimental setup",
    ", we explore a way to divide the ensemble described by @xmath24 .",
    "this novel technique makes partitions over the acquisition time where different operators @xmath88 acts on each time division . instead of using a single static image on the slm2",
    ", we use a film , which are kinetic images related to the operations @xmath85 . during a certain time interval which corresponds to a single kinetic image",
    ", the four rectangular regions at slm2 will have different gray levels but constant at this time division .",
    "the gray levels are chosen such that the path phases added by the slm2 implement the kraus operators @xmath88 ( eq . 8 and 9 ) . a sequence of 32 of these gray levels patterns changing at each time division constitutes what we call a film .",
    "the time duration of a film is equal to the acquisition time . because the spdc process generates randomly photon pairs , on average the same number of down - converted photons are generated at equal intervals",
    "so , our ensemble is formed by twin - photons generated over equal time intervals .",
    "therefore the acquisition time is partitioned into 32 equal time intervals and the parameter @xmath90 is implemented over a whole acquisition time .",
    "also , the parameter @xmath90 varies according to each film . in figure  [ intervalosdetempo ]",
    "illustrates the implementation of the dephasing dynamics for distinct values of parameter @xmath90 . for parameter @xmath91 , the film is composed by 32 equal consecutive images that perform 32 times the operator @xmath92 ( identity ) . for parameter @xmath93 , the film is composed by 28 equal consecutive images ( operator @xmath92 ) , followed by four consecutive images related to operators @xmath85 , with @xmath94 , respectively . for @xmath95 , the film is composed by 4 sets of 8 equal consecutive images which perform the operators @xmath31 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 exposed at equal time intervals , while the image related to operator @xmath99 is not included in the slides sequence .",
    "repeating the formerly procedure , a dephasing dynamics was performed varying the parameter @xmath90 in steps of @xmath100 within the interval @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "dephasing dynamics can be characterized through the two - photon conditional interference patterns .",
    "such patterns allow us to obtain the experimental values for the parameters @xmath90",

    "the scale factor @xmath111 has a dimensionless value of @xmath112 and appears due to the combination of the lens @xmath76 and @xmath79 .",
    ".[deftable ] experimental and predicted values of @xmath90 for dephasing dynamics on ququarts .",

    "in this work we experimentally demonstrated simulations of dissipative dynamics on quantum systems in a simple implementation .",

    "the dissipative operators for simulating dephasing and amplitude damping dynamics were realized by means of a spatial light modulator .",
    "dephasing dynamics was performed completely and amplitude damping dynamics was implemented partially , in which we performed only the no - jump trajectory . in the dephasing dynamics we measured the interference patterns to calculate the parameter @xmath90 , related to coherence loss . besides , in the amplitude damping dynamics we measured the population which allows us to identify population changes from higher to lower levels . to identify the implementation success we used a parameter that represents the principal characteristic of the evolution : coherence loss for dephasing and population changes for amplitude damping .",
    "spatial photonic states are interesting systems to make quantum computation using qudits .",
    "the implemented dissipative dynamics are general and do not depend on the initial state and can also be extended to different system dimensions .",
