    "the influence of a single impurity on the conductance of a quasi one - dimensional quantum channel has been investigated by several groups theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite commonly the impurities are considered to be short range and represented by a @xmath0-function , though treatments of more extended scatterers , like square barriers,@xcite can be found .",

    "a transformation of this system of equations to corresponding equations for the @xmath1-matrix shows that it bears a strong resemblance to the corresponding equations for the system in no external magnetic field.@xcite we exploit this fact to seek numerical solutions for the system in weak and intermediate strength of the magnetic field where a two mode approximation is not always warranted .",
