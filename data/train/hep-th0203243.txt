    "we shall primarily be concerned with the geometry describing these configurations , its evolution as branes and antibranes annihilate each other and some similarities between the qualitative patterns that we find in this evolution and some recent results on the evolution due to the condensation of localised closed string tachyons in non - supersymmetric orbifold singularities  @xcite .",

    "gives rise to a reduction in the size of the bolt and a desingularization of the conical singularities , by which they become `` less conical '' . in the sector of non - vanishing charge ,",
    "the bolt becomes a nut , whereas in the vanishing charge sector , the bolt disappears .    locally , when the size of the bolt is big , the system looks like @xmath13 .",
    "the size of the bolt is proportional to the product of the number of branes , the number of antibranes and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , big bolt limit means that @xmath15 is big , i.e. the number of branes and antibranes should be large in order to keep a small string coupling .",
    "thus , by reducing along a trivial circle , the original d6-@xmath9 system is related to a @xmath1 orbifold in the forementioned limit . whenever @xmath16 , there are closed string tachyons in the twisted sectors .",

    "there is a _ bolt _ type singularity at @xmath33 , both in the charged and non - charged sectors , for non - zero values of @xmath33 . when approaching the supersymmetric configuration , the fate of the _ bolt _ singularity depends on the sector in which we are :    * if @xmath74 , it gives rise to the usual _ nut _ singularity at @xmath91 where the monopoles ( or antimonopoles ) are sitting",

    "the solution is defined for @xmath104 , the interior of the sphere @xmath105 not belonging to the solution .",

    "thus , any source of instability reflected in the geometry has to be in the region @xmath110 , at which we shall now look in detail .",
    "let us start our analysis in the charged sector @xmath111 .",

    "after a trivial rescaling of the new radial coordinate , the four dimensional metric looks like    @xmath114    thus , close to the bolt , the periodicity of the compact coordinate @xmath115 is reduced by a factor    @xmath116    which indeed points out to the existence of conical singularities whose angular deficit is @xmath117 .",
    "notice that these singularities are located on a sphere of radius @xmath118 , whose area is    @xmath119    notice that the area takes discrete values depending on the integer numbers representing the number of branes and antibranes .",
    "even though the scalar curvature vanishes on the bolt , due to the existence of the conical singularities , one might wonder about higher order corrections to the eleven dimensional effective action close to the bolt .",
    "to clarify this issue , one can analyse the behaviour of the square of the riemann tensor .",
    "such corrections would be suppressed whenever    @xmath120    working in the regime in which the number of branes is of the same order as the number of antibranes @xmath121 , the above constraint looks like    @xmath122    therefore such corrections can be neglected when the size of the bolt is big in eleven dimensional planck units , or equivalently    @xmath123    notice that in order to keep the string coupling constant small , the number of branes must be large .",
    "this is the approximation we would like to use .",
    "when the size of the bolt is big @xmath124 , the metric close to the bolt is a huge sphere times a cone .",

    ", the metric reduces to and depends on a single parameter @xmath33 , which can be written in terms of the number @xmath133 of d6-@xmath9 pairs as    @xmath134    since @xmath57 vanishes , the surfaces r = constant are trivial fibrations @xmath135 .",
    "the assymptotic geometries are @xmath136 , whereas close to @xmath110 , one can check , proceeding in an analogous way to the previous discussion , that the bolt structure remains . in this case , the deficit in the periodicity is @xmath137 .",

    "once more , the gravity approximation is reliable in the large bolt limit .",
    "when one trivially reduces the previous m - theory configurations by adding an extra transverse compact circle , one finds a generically non supersymmetric purely gravitational ( geometrical ) type iia configuration .",
    "thus , the analysis of singularities discussed above still applies to this geometry .",
    "we are thus left with two different descriptions in type iia of a single m - theory configuration : first , the brane - antibrane system and on the other hand , geometrical configurations with conical singularities located on a sphere .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of big bolt , the geometry of the conical singularities is locally given by that of an orbifold type , @xmath140 .",
    "thus , it is clear that both systems contain tachyons ; the brane - antibrane system in the open string sector from strings stretching between a brane and antibrane , whereas in the orbifold side , there are closed string tachyons in the twisted sectors .",
    "these tachyons can be understood as localised on the bolt .",
    "some properties of this kind of closed string twisted sectors and their possible evolution have been analysed in  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall show that the expected annihilation of brane - antibrane pairs in the open string side matches the reduction in the order of the non - supersymmetric orbifold observed in the previous cited references .",

    "]    when considered from the m - theory effective description in terms of a classical solution of the supergravity equations of motion , the latter depends on two continuous parameters : @xmath144 and @xmath128 .",
    "nevertheless , one can study the evolution in the geometry of the family of configurations by moving in such a two dimensional parameter space .",
    "indeed , we are interested in studying the decrease in the mass @xmath144 while keeping the charge @xmath128 fixed .",
    "it is clear that such a motion requires a decrease of @xmath33 while @xmath83 increases `` along the flow '' .",

    ", the flow corresponds to a straight line at @xmath154 , and the decrease in @xmath33 is directly related to the decrease in @xmath155 .",
    "then close to the bolt there is an orbifold description as @xmath156 .",
    "the process of annihilating branes and antibranes takes @xmath157 . from the orbifold point of view that corresponds to a transition @xmath158 .",
    "notice that this process is very similar to the one found by  @xcite where the orbifold singularity is desingularising till reaches the flat space by @xmath159 ( see figure  [ orbi ] ) .",
    "notice that in the orbifold description in  @xcite , the order of the orbifold is odd while in our case is even .",
    "however as we have already said , the correspondence between the two systems is expected to happen only at large n.    notice that in both sides , brane - antibrane annihilation and the vev of the twisted field are discontinuous , so our approximation of continuous mass variation has no meaning between these points .",
    "when interpreted in terms of branes and antibranes , we have seen that the radius of the bolt takes discrete values as well as the @xmath83 parameter .",
    "notice that , as discussed in  @xcite , the process of desingularising the cone is expected to be discontinuous .",
    "so one expects sudden changes in the volume of the bolt from both sides .",
    "for example , one can consider the emission of dilaton fields by the brane - antibrane annihilation into the bulk .",
    "that will correspond to a sudden change in the m - theory coordinate that looks like the cone change in the twisted orbifold side as described in @xcite .",
    "it will be very interesting to relate these two discontinuous processes in detail . from the m - theory point of view",
    ", we can see the bolt as emitting waves that change suddenly the shape of the cone till the bolt disappear to a point .",
    "it is important to notice that we are not mapping open string to closed string tachyons , we are just comparing the behaviour and evolution of two different systems related by an m - theory lift .",
    "if one naively tries to map one open to one closed string tachyon , one immediately realises that things are not working . for large number of pairs of branes and antibranes",
    "n the counting of open string tachyons goes like @xmath160 but the number of twisted closed string tachyons grows like n. also the perturbative masses of these states do not match .",
    "however , the number of steps driving the system to the supersymmetric configuration is the same , of order n. this is because when a pair brane - antibrane disappears there are also n open string tachyons that decouple from the spectrum .",
    "the relation among @xmath161 orbifolds and d6-@xmath9 systems in the large bolt limit leads us to consider a non - supersymmetric orbifold of type iia , perform its trivial lift to m - theory and reduce it afterwards along a circle inside the orbifold .",
    "the configuration thus obtained can not be trusted far away from the origin , but it must correspond to the local description of some d6-brane system . notice that this is exactly what happens for the supersymmetric orbifold @xmath162 : this produces the familiar supersymmetric @xmath99 orbifolds ( for review see  @xcite ) , as reviewed at the beginning of section 3 , which upon reduction along the hopf fibre , gives rise to the local description of a system of n coincident d6-branes located at the fixed points of the @xmath163 along which we performed the reduction .",

    "we will see that after reduction along the hopf fibre , the type iia configuration has a line of conical singularities with some fractional d6-branes located at the origin whenever @xmath165 .",
    "it is important to stress , once more , that the forthcoming analysis is only reliable close to where the d - branes are located .",

    "the orbifold does not preserve supersymmetry because each subgroup preserves supersymmetries of different chirality .",
    "thus , whenever the order of both subgroups ( n , m ) is different from 1 , the total orbifold breaks supersymmetry completely . due to the identifications associated with the orbifold construction , there are now two cones associated with each of the subgroups @xmath175    one can work with angular variables satisfying the standard periodicity conditions by rescaling @xmath176 . in this way",

    "in this paper , we have analysed the geometry of the lift to m - theory of certain d6-@xmath9 systems . for any non - bps configuration",
    ", we find a bolt type singularity .",
    "the annihilation of d6-@xmath9 pairs in the open string description is realised , on the gravity side , by a reduction on the size of the bolt and a desingularization of the conical singularities on it . in the large bolt limit",
    ", the m - theory geometry is locally described by @xmath187 .",
    "this allowed us to qualitatively match the annihilation of d6-@xmath9 pairs with the sequences of transitions described in @xmath161 non - supersymmetric orbifolds .",
    "as we have already said , the process is discontinuous in both sides .",
    "it would be very interesting to analyse how the discrete evolution is produced . having realised this connection , we considered the non - supersymmetric orbifold @xmath188 and its relation with a local description of unstable branes , which turned out to be fractional d6-branes on a @xmath1 singularity .",
    "there are several natural questions related with the results reported here . due to the relation among d6-brane systems and @xmath161 orbifolds",
    ", it would be very interesting to investigate if there is any brane realisation for the sequences of transitions found in  @xcite regarding non - supersymmetric @xmath189 orbifolds",
    ".    we would also like to point out that the brane - antibrane system discussed in this paper can be interpreted as a particular case of a pair of d6-branes at generic angles , the one in which they have opposite orientations .",
    "these more general systems do generically break supersymmetry and in some regions of their moduli space , they are empty of tachyons .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the m - theory dynamics in these cases  @xcite .",
    "other physical systems which have recently been given a lot of attention and do also have localised closed string tachyons are fluxbranes  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the stability and supersymmetry of some of them using similar local descriptions to the ones appearing in this work .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis in section 5 is just a local one , as can be seen from the fact that the dilaton ( string coupling ) increases as we move away from the origin",
    ". it would be nice to look for non - bps configurations whose validity of description goes beyond the region where the brane sits .",
    "we would like to thank p. barbn , r. emparan , y. oz and a. uranga for discussions , and especially r. emparan for pointing out the existence of reference @xcite and for his comments on the first version of this work .",
