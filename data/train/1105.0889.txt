    "the bayesian approach to inverse problems is an attractive one .",
    "it mathematizes the way many practitioners incorporate new data into their understanding of a given phenomenon ; and it results in a precise quantification of uncertainty .",
    "although this approach to inverse problems has a long history , starting with the paper @xcite , it is only in the last decade that its use has become widespread as a computationl tool @xcite .",
    "the theoretical side of the subject , which is the focus of this paper , is far from fully developed , with many interesting open questions . the work @xcite concerned linear gaussian problems , and the mathematical underpinnings of such problems were laid in the papers @xcite .",
    "an important theme in subsequent theoretical work concerning linear gaussian problems has been to study the effect of discretization , in both the state space and the data space , and to identify approaches which give rise to meaningful limits @xcite . in many imaging problems , the detection of edges and interfaces is important and such problems are not well modelled by gaussian priors .",
    "this has led to two recent works which try to circumvent this issue : the paper @xcite introduces the notion of besov priors , based on wavelet expansions , and the paper @xcite uses heirarchical gaussian models to create a discretization of the mumford - shah penalization , in one dimension .",
    "the thesis @xcite studies a number of related issues for quite general measurement models .",
    "a different series of papers has studied the development of bayesian inversion with gaussian priors and nonlinear measurement functions @xcite , in which general criteria for a bayes theorem , interpreted to mean that the posterior distribution has density with respect to the prior , are given .",
    "this framework has been used to study the effect of approximation of both the space in which the prior lies and the forward model @xcite , allowing the transfer of error estimates for the approximation of the forward problem , into estimates for the approximation of the posterior measure .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend this type of approximation theory from gaussian priors to the besov priors introduced in @xcite , and in the case of nonlinear measurement functions .",
    "we consider the noisy nonlinear operator equation @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 banach spaces and @xmath4 a @xmath5-valued random variable .",
    "we suppose in this paper that @xmath6 , the operator @xmath7 and the statistical properties of @xmath4 are known , and an estimation of @xmath8 is to be found .",
    "such an inverse problem appears in many practical situations where the function of interest ( here @xmath0 ) can not be observed directly and has to be obtained from other observable quantities and through the mathematical model relating them .",
    "this problem is in general ill - posed and therefore to obtain a reasonable approximation of @xmath0 in a stable way , we need prior information about the solution @xcite . in particular if we expect the unknown function to be sparse in some specific orthonormal basis of @xmath9 , implementing the prior information in a way that respects this sparsity will result in more efficient finite - dimensional approximation of the solution .",
    "for instance a smooth function with a few local irregularities has a more sparse expansion in a wavelet basis compared , for example , to a fourier basis , and adopting regularization methods which respect the sparse wavelet expansion of the unknown function is of interest in many applications .",
    "approximation techniques based on wavelet bases for recovering finite dimensional estimates of the unknown function are extensively studied in the approximation theory , signal processsing and statistics literature ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite introduced a nonparametric bayesian approach to the problem of signal recovery , adopting a clever posterior construction tuned to the simple form of the observation operator .",
    "the paper @xcite considers more general linear observation operators and constructs the wavelet - based besov prior ; the construction is through a generalization of the karhunen - lov expansion to non - gaussian coefficients and wavelet bases .",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach to the above inverse problem , so that regularization is implicit in the prior measure on @xmath9 .",
    "we study the besov prior measure introduced in @xcite as this measure is constructed so that it factors as the product of independent measures along members of a wavelet basis , see section [ s : bbayes ] .",
    "we first make sense of bayes rule in an infinite dimensional setting , and then study the finite dimensional approximations after having proved the well - posedness of the posterior over an infinite - dimensional banach space .",
    "bayes rule for functions is here interpreted as follows .",
    "we put a prior probability measure @xmath10 on @xmath0 and then specify the distribution of @xmath11 via , thereby defining a joint probability distribution on @xmath12 if the posterior measure @xmath13 is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior measure @xmath14 then bayes theorem is interpreted as the following formula for the radon - nikodym derivative : @xmath15 here @xmath16 depends on the the specific instance of the data @xmath6 , the forward ( or observation ) operator @xmath7 and the distribution of @xmath4 ( see section [ s : bbayes ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we work in the case where @xmath9 comprises periodic functions on the @xmath17dimensional torus @xmath18 ; generalizations are possible .",
    "the problem of making sense of bayes rule for nonlinear observation operators , and with a gaussian prior , is addressed in @xcite ; sufficient conditions on @xmath16 and the gaussian prior @xmath19 which imply the well - definedness and well - posedness of the posterior are obtained .",
    "key to obtaining the conditions on @xmath16 is the fernique theorem for gaussian measures which gives an upper bound on the growth of @xmath19-integrable functions .",
    "our aim here is to generalize the results of @xcite to the case of besov prior measures and so we need a similar fernique - like result for the besov measures . in section [ s : besov - mu ] , following @xcite , we construct the besov measures using wavelet expansions with i.i.d .",
    "random coefficients ( karhunen - lov expansions ) of their draws , and prove a fernique - like result for these measures ( theorem [ t : fer ] ) .",
    "we then use this result in section [ s : bbayes ] to find the conditions on the operator @xmath7 which ensure the well - definedness ( theorem [ t : welldb ] ) and well - posedness ( theorem [ t : wellpb ] ) of the posterior measure @xmath20 , provided that the besov measure @xmath19 is chosen appropriately .",
    "we then build on this theory to quantify finite dimensional approximation of the posterior measure , culminating in theorem [ t : wellp2b ] .",
    "in section [ s : elliptic ] we apply these results to the inverse problem of finding the diffusion coefficient of a linear uniformly elliptic partial differential equation in divergence form , in a bounded domain in dimension @xmath21 , from measurements of the solution in the interior .",
    "such an inverse problem emerges in geophysical applications where @xmath0 is the log - permeability of the subsurface .",
    "it is studied using a bayesian approach on function space in @xcite for gaussian priors and in @xcite for non - gaussian priors which give rise to an almost sure uniform lower bound on the permeability . in many subsurface applications",
    "it is natural to expect that @xmath0 is a smooth function with a few local irregularities , and it is not natural to expect an almost sure uniform lower bound on the permeability , nor is a gaussian prior appropriate . for these reasons a wavelet basis , and hence a besov prior , provides a plausible candidate from a modelling perspective .",
    "we show that the conditions we require for @xmath16 in this problem hold naturally when @xmath9 is the space of hlder continuous functions @xmath22 .",
    "this also suggests the use of wavelet bases which are unconditional bases for @xmath22 .",
    "thus for the elliptic inverse problem with besov priors we state a well - posedness result for the posterior measure ( theorem [ thm : dwellposterior ] ) and we also quantify the effect of the finite dimensional approximation of the log - permiablility in the wavelet basis used in construction of the prior , on the posterior measure , with result summarized in theorem [ t : appw ] .",
    "we develop besov measures following the construction in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be a basis for @xmath24 , @xmath25^d$ ] , @xmath26 , so that any @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 let @xmath29 be a banach space with norm @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we now construct a probability measure on functions by randomizing the coefficients of an expansion in the basis @xmath23 .",
    "the space @xmath29 will play a role analogous to the cameron - martin space for this measure .",
    "indeed when @xmath23 is chosen to be the karhunen - love basis for a gaussian measure and @xmath34 , our choice of coefficients will ensure that @xmath35 is precisely the cameron - martin space .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath33 , and @xmath37 be fixed and @xmath38 be real - valued i.i.d .",
    "random variables with probability density function @xmath39 let the random function @xmath0 be defined as follows @xmath40 we will refer to the induced measure on functions @xmath0 as @xmath41 we note that , since @xmath23 is an orthonormal basis and @xmath42 with @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 thus , informally , @xmath0 has a lebesgue density proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is distributed according to an @xmath29 measure with parameter @xmath46 , or , briefly , a @xmath47 measure .",
    "[ r : psi ] if @xmath23 in ( [ e : ranfun ] ) is an @xmath48-regular wavelet basis - regular wavelet basis for @xmath49 is a wavelet basis with @xmath48-regular scaling function and mother wavelets .",
    "a function @xmath50 is @xmath48-regular if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for any integer @xmath53 and any multi - index @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "an @xmath48-regular basis for @xmath24 is obtained by periodification of the @xmath48-regular wavelets of @xmath49 @xcite . ] for @xmath24 , with @xmath56 , then @xmath30 is the besov @xmath57 @xcite norm and @xmath0 is distributed according to a @xmath58 measure .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath34 with @xmath23 either a wavelet or fourier basis , we obtain a gaussian measure with cameron - martin space @xmath59 , which is simply the hilbert space @xmath60 . indeed ( [ e : ranfun ] ) reduces to @xmath61 where @xmath62 are independent and identically distributed mean zero , unit variance gaussian random variables .",
    "this is simply the karhunen - love representation of draws from a mean zero gaussian measure .",
    "the following result shows that the random variable @xmath0 is well - defined and characterizes apsects of its regularity .",
    "@xcite [ p : lasfer ] let @xmath0 be distributed according to a @xmath47 measure . the following are equivalent    * @xmath63 almost surely . *",
    "@xmath64 for any @xmath65 * @xmath66 .    part ( ii ) of the above proposition provides a fernique - like result @xcite for besov priors .",
    "indeed for @xmath34 , this implies the fernique theorem for all spaces @xmath67 , @xmath68 on which the measure is supported . the fernique result for gaussian measures ,",
    "however , is much stronger : it shows that if @xmath8 almost surely with respect to the gaussian measure @xmath69 then @xmath70 for @xmath71 small enough .",
    "theorem [ t : fer ] below goes some way towards showing a similar result for besov measures by extending ( ii ) to @xmath22 spaces ( see remark [ r : fer ] ) .",
    "theorem [ t : fer ] will also be useful in section [ s : bbayes ] when we deal with inverse problems , in the sense that it allows less restrictive conditions on the prior measure .    before proving theorem [ t : fer ] we make a preliminary observation concerning the regularity of @xmath0 given by in @xmath22 spaces . with the same conditions on @xmath72 and @xmath73 as are assumed in proposition [ p : lasfer ] one can show that @xmath74 .",

    "motivated by the sparsity promoting features of the wavelet bases for many classes of functions appearing in applications , we studied the use of the besov priors introduced in @xcite within the bayesian formalism .",
    "our main goal has been to generalize the results of @xcite on well - definedness and well - posedness of the posterior measure for the gaussian priors , to the case of besov priors .",
    "we showed that if the operator @xmath7 satisfies certain regularity conditions on the banach space @xmath9 , then provided that the besov prior is chosen appropriately , the posterior measure over @xmath9 is well - defined and well - posed ( theorems [ t : welldb ] and [ t : wellpb ] ) . using the well - posedness of the posterior on the infinite - dimensional space @xmath9",
    ", we then studied the convergence of the appropriate finite - dimensional approximations of the posterior . in finding the required conditions on @xmath7 , it is essential to know which functions of @xmath0 have finite integral with respect to the besov prior @xmath19 . in other words",
    "we need a result similar to the fernique theorem from gaussian measures , for the besov case . a fernique - like result for hlder norms",
    "is proved in theorem [ t : fer ] , and may be of independent interest .    as an application of these results , we have considered the problem of finding the diffusion coefficient of an elliptic partial differential equation from noisy measurements of its solution .",
    "we have found the conditions on the besov prior which make the bayesian formalism well - posed for this problem .",
    "we have also considered the approximation of the posterior measure on a finite - dimensional space spanned by finite number of elements of the same wavelet basis used in constructing the prior measure , and quantified the error incurred by such an approximation .",
    "a question left open by the analysis in this paper is how to extract information from the posterior measure .",
    "typical information desired in applications involves the computation of expectations with respect to the posterior .",
    "a natural approach to this is through the use of markov chain - monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "for gaussian priors there has been considerable recent effort to develop new mcmc methods which are discretization invariant @xcite in that they are well - defined in the infinite dimensional limit ; it would be interesting to extend this methodology to besov priors . in the meantime",
    "the analysis of standard random walk and langevin algorithms in @xcite applies to the posterior meausures constructed in this paper and quantifies the increase in computational cost incurred as dimension increases , resulting from the fact that the infinite dimensional limit is not defined for these standard algorithms .",
    "a second approach to integration in high dimensions is via polynomial chaos approximation @xcite and a recent application of this approach to an inverse problem may be found in @xcite .",
    "a third approach is the use of quasi - monte carlo methods ; see @xcite .",
