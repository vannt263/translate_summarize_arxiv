    "super star clusters ( sscs ) are dense clusters of young massive stars , first identified in ngc 1705 by melnick et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and in ngc 1569 by arp & sandage ( 1985 ) .",
    "recently , they have been observed in a wide range of star - forming galaxies , such as merging systems ( ngc 4038/4039 , whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) , dwarf galaxies ( henize 2 - 10 , johnson et al .",
    "2000 ) , classical starbursts ( m82 , gallagher & smith 1999 , melo et al . 2005 ) , as well as in our galaxy ( arches cluster  : nagata et al .",
    "1995 ; cotera et al .",
    "1996 ; serabyn , shupe & figer 1998 ) amongst many other systems ( for a review see whitmore 2000 ) .",
    "these star clusters can contain hundreds or thousands of very young , energetic stars , and have stellar densities far greater than those seen in normal ob associations .",
    "the ages of most of these star clusters are around 1- 10 myr , their radii typically in the range of @xmath0 1 -10 pc , and their total cluster masses in the @xmath1 - @xmath2 m@xmath3 range ( melo et al .",
    "2005 reported a mean mass per star cluster , of @xmath4 @xmath5 , for m82 ) .",
    "the central stellar densities of sscs reach up to @xmath0 @xmath6 m@xmath3 pc@xmath7 .",
    "however , we can find sscs with older ages and/or larger masses ( walcher et al .",
    "2006 reports a cluster with 6 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath5 ) .",
    "cant et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter paper i ) explored an analytic model using the physical properties of the _ arches cluster_. this cluster has @xmath10 massive stars within a @xmath0 0.2 - 0.3 pc radius .",
    "such ssc must have strong multiple stellar wind interactions , resulting in the formation of stellar wind shocks . in paper",
    "i , the cluster wind was modeled as a mass - loading process ( hartquist et al . 1986 ; dyson 1992 ; lizano et al .",
    "1996 ) , resulting in essentially the same model as the one presented by chevalier & clegg ( 1985 , who studied the flow resulting from a continuous temporal and spatial distribution of supernovae explosions ) .    both in the stationary solution for spherically symmetric winds ( chevalier & clegg 1985 , cant et al . 2000 ) and in the numerical calculations of raga",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) the stellar distribution ( within the cluster ) was assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "also , these models are adiabatic ( or , more precisely , non - radiative ) solutions , which are appropiate for sscs with low to intermediate mass and/or terminal velocity of sscs ( masses around @xmath11 - @xmath2 @xmath5 and terminal velocities of @xmath12 km / s ) . for more massive stellar clusters , lower stellar wind terminal velocities or higher metallicities , radiative losses within the cluster wind may become important ( see silich et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we explore a non - radiative analytic model for cluster winds , considering a non - homogeneous stellar distribution ( within the cluster ) . in particular , we study the case in which the stars have a @xmath13 power - law distribution ( where @xmath14 is the number of stars per unit volume as a function of the spherical radius @xmath15 ) , with @xmath16 . we also compute 3d gasdynamical simulations for stellar distribution functions with different values of @xmath17 , and compare the properties of the computed flows with the analytic model .",
    "this work is a natural extension of the model presented in paper i.    we note that matvienko & shchekinov ( 2005 ) have presented a study of mass loaded flows with sources and sinks with power law spatial distributions .",
    "the analytic model that we discuss in the present paper is based on a similar set of equations , but describes a cluster wind , rather than a mass loaded stellar wind ( as was studied by matvienko & shchekinov 2005 ) . also relevant in the context of the present work",
    "are the papers of raga et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and rockefeller et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who carried out 3d numerical simulations of winds from stratified clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the analytical solution . in section 3",
    ", we describe the numerical simulations and compare the results with the analytic model .",
    "predictions of the x - ray emission from the simulated flows are described in section 4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 5 . +",
    "we consider @xmath18 identical stars in a spherical cluster with an outer radius @xmath19 .",
    "the stars have a spatial distribution ( number of stars per unit volume ) of the form ,    @xmath20    where @xmath15 is the spherical radius , @xmath17 and @xmath21 are constants . in the second equality ,",
    "the constant @xmath21 has been computed using the normalization condition    @xmath22    every star has an identical wind with mass and energy depositon rates @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and terminal velocity @xmath25 . for highly supersonic wind , @xmath26 the stellar winds are thermalized at shocks ( produced by interactions between the multiple winds ) , resulting in the production of a hot intercluster gas .",
    "this gas has a large central overpressure , which eventually produce a stationary ` cluster wind ' flow .",
    "+ for an adiabatic , spherically symmetric cluster wind ( and negleting the gravity due to the stellar distribution ) , the mass , momentum and energy equations are  :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29=n(r ) \\dot{e}_w\\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the mass density and velocity of the wind respectively , @xmath15 is the radial coordinate , @xmath32 and @xmath33is the specific enthalpy , @xmath34 is the mean gas pressure and @xmath35 is the specific heat ratio .",
    "+ equation  ( [ eq : massconsin ] ) implies that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total mass loss rate from the cluster in steady state .",
    "this equation shows that the mass flux profile strongly depends on the @xmath17 exponent .",
    "+ the adiabatic sound speed @xmath38 is given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gas temperature , @xmath41 is the mean mass per particle and @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant . integrating equation  ( [ eq : enconsin ] ) and using equations  ( [ eq : enthalpy ] ) and ( [ eq : soundspeed ] ) we find    @xmath43    now , combining equations ( [ eq : momconsin ] ) , ( [ eq : fluxin ] ) and ( [ eq : energysol ] ) we obtain @xmath44 where , @xmath45 , @xmath46\\gamma)/(\\gamma-1)$ ] , and @xmath47 . in terms of the dimensionless variables , @xmath48 @xmath49 ,",
    "this equation admits solutions , @xmath50 in equation ( [ eq : velin ] ) , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is an integration constant .",
    "+ outside the cluster ( i.  e. , for @xmath54 ) @xmath55 , and the mass and momentum conservation equations have the form , @xmath56 @xmath57    combining equations ( [ eq : massconsout ] ) and ( [ eq : momconsout ] ) , we obtain , @xmath58 where , @xmath59 is a constant .",
    "+ the velocity of the flow , ( @xmath60 ) at the outer boundary of the cluster ( @xmath61 ) follows from equation  ( [ eq : velout ] ) , + @xmath62    the value of the integration constants @xmath53 and b are determined by the boundary conditions at @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 .",
    "they , of course , depend also on the value of @xmath17 .",
    "there are three different regimes  :    * a. @xmath66  :* + in this regime , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( also both @xmath69 and @xmath700 ) . from equation ( [ eq : velin ] )",
    "we can see that very close to the centre of the cluster , @xmath71 the wind velocity inside the cluster is subsonic , the velocity at the centre of the cluster is zero and the density is finite .",
    "the gas velocity increases towards the outer cluster boundary , and the flow at this boundary ( @xmath63 ) follows from equation (  [ eq : velin ] ) , @xmath72^q\\,.\\ ] ] the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : velboundaryout ] ) has a maximum value of @xmath73 for @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the requirement that the pressure at infinity must go to zero implies that the flow has to adopt the critical solution , for which @xmath75 and , @xmath76    we can then use equations  ( [ eq : fluxin ] ) , ( [ eq : soundspeed ] ) , ( [ eq : energysol ] ) and ( [ eq : velcenter ] ) to obtain the properties of the cluster wind at the centre of the cluster ( see paper i ) : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79    * b. @xmath80  :* + in this interval , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus the velocity inside the cluster is subsonic and has a non - zero value at the cluster centre ( @xmath85 ) . from equation  ( [ eq : velin ] )",
    "@xmath86    on the other hand , equation  ( [ eq : fluxin ] ) indicates that the mass flux of the wind is inversely proportional to a positive power of @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the central gas density tend to infinite . from equations  ( [ eq : soundspeed ] ) , ( [ eq : energysol ] ) and ( [ eq : veloc1 ] ) the central temperature is , @xmath88    * c. @xmath89 :  *    in this regime , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the velocity of the wind remains constant ( with a supersonic value ) within the cluster .",
    "its magnitud is given by equation  ( [ eq : veloc1 ] ) .",
    "the temperature is also uniform inside the cluster and is given by equation  ( [ eq : temp1 ] ) .",
    "the density also goes to infinity at the centre of the cluster and decreases outwards . but",
    "the wind escapes from the cluster surface supersonically , and accelerates outwards , until it reaches the terminal velocity .",
    "we do not consider power - law stellar distributions with @xmath90 because they have an infinite number of stars ( resulting from the strong divergence of the distribution function in the cluster centre ) .",
    "in order to illustrate the analytic star cluster wind solutions we have computed 3d numerical simulations with the full , non - radiative gasdynamic equations . the simulations solve a multiple stellar wind interaction problem with the 3d , adaptive grid `` yguaz - a '' code , which is described in detail by raga et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "the simulations were computed on a five - level binary adaptive grid with a maximum resolution of 0.1172 pc ( corresponding to @xmath91 grid points at the maximum grid resolution ) in a computational domain of 30 pc ( along each of the 3 coordinate axes ) .",
    "+ in all runs , we assumed that the computational domain was initially filled by a homogeneous , stationary ambient medium with temperature @xmath92 500 k and density @xmath93 cm@xmath7 .",
    "the stellar winds are imposed in spheres ( centred at the stellar positions , see below ) of radius @xmath95 cm , corresponding to 6 pixels at the maximum resolution of the adaptive grid . within these spheres ,",
    "we impose ( at all times ) a @xmath96  k temperature , and an outwardly directed @xmath97  km  s@xmath98 velocity .",
    "the density within the spheres has an @xmath99 law ( where @xmath87 is the radial coordinate measured outwards from the stellar position ) , scaled so that the mass loss rate is @xmath100 m@xmath3 yr@xmath98 for each star .",
    "we then place 100 such stellar wind sources within a spherical cluster of outer radius @xmath101  pc , centred in the computational domain .",
    "we have computed four simulations of clusters with power - law stellar distributions ( see equation [ eq : stellardens ] ) with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the stellar positions are chosen by statistically sampling the distribution functions in the way described in section [ sec : starpos ] .      in order to produce models that can be compared with the analytic solutions , we place stars within the cluster with positions obtained by randomly sampling the power - law distribution function given by equation ( [ eq : stellardens ] ) .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "we first note that @xmath104 ( with @xmath105 given by equation [ eq : stellardens ] ) is the fraction of the stars which have radial positions between @xmath15 and @xmath106 . using the normalization condition",
    "@xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108 this normalization is of course valid only for @xmath109 since otherwise a divergence occurs at the lower limit of the normalization integral .    with a random number generator",
    "we then choose a number @xmath110 which is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "this variable is statistically related to the radius @xmath15 through the relation  : @xmath112    from equations ( [ eq : frac]-[eq : intrand ] ) we obtain @xmath113 from which we can sample @xmath15 as a function of the random number @xmath110 .",
    "once we have chosen the radial coordinate for each of the @xmath18 stars ( used in the simulation ) by sampling the radial distribution function ( as described above ) , we asign random directions to the vector position of each of the stars . in this way , we obtain statistical samplings of the stellar position functions .    in practice",
    ", we have to modify the obtained stellar distributions because we impose the stellar wind conditions in spheres of a finite radius @xmath114 ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "whenever we obtain pairs of stellar positions resulting in overlapping `` stellar wind spheres '' , we elliminate one of the two stars .",
    "this leads to an undersampling of the desired distribution function in the central , high stellar density regions of the generated clusters . because of this , the comparison between the numerical simulations and the analytic cluster wind solutions is only meaningful away from the central region of the cluster .",
    "we should note that the 100 stars of each model were chosen with the same set of random numbers , so that the directions from the cluster centre to each of the stars are the same in all models .",
    "however , the physical radii corresponding to the `` radial random numbers '' differ for each model , as the `` conversion '' from random number ( @xmath110 ) to physical radius @xmath15 ( see equation [ eq : randr ] ) depends on the value of @xmath17 .       model .",
    "the solid line represents the outer boundary of the cluster.,width=245 ]    we computed four numerical simulations of clusters with stellar distributions with different @xmath17 values .",
    "all models are computed for clusters with 100 stars and a 10 pc outer radius .",
    "the stars are identical , with a mass deposition rate of @xmath115 m@xmath3 yr@xmath98 and a wind velocity of 1000 km / s .",
    "the only difference between the models are the stellar density distributions .",
    "we have chosen @xmath17 values ( see equation  [ eq : stellardens ] ) covering the different regimes of the cluster wind flow ( see section  [ sec : analytic ] ) .",
    "we have integrated forward in time the four models until stationary flows are obtained . from the stationary flow configurations ,",
    "we then compute ( through appropriate interpolations in the cartesian adaptive grid ) the radially dependent flow density , velocity and temperature averaged over spherical concentric surfaces @xmath116  : @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , and @xmath30 is the flow density , @xmath40 the temperature and @xmath122 the radial velocity ( obtained by projecting the three cartesian velocity components resulting from the numerical integration onto the direction normal to the spherical surface ) . that is @xmath123 .",
    "we then compare this spherically averaged flow with the results from our analytic cluster wind model .",

    "the average flow variables as a function of spherical radius ( obtained by averaging over concentric spherical shells , see above ) are compared with the solution obtained from the analytic model in figure [ fig : r0 ] . from this figure , it is clear that the average density , velocity and temperature ( obtained from the numerical simulation ) agree very well with the analytical model , except close to the centre of the cluster .",
    "the deviations in the cluster centre are a direct result of the small number of stars that is present within the inner @xmath127  pc of the cluster ( see figure [ fig : posr0 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : distr0 ] illustrates the real complexity of the flow that is obtained from the numerical simulations .",
    "this figure shows a 3d rendition of the 10 pc radius star cluster , with 100 stars and @xmath125 .",
    "the flow has a sponge - like morphology , with low density stellar wind cavities immersed in the denser ` cluster wind ' flow ( composed of shocked stellar wind material ) .",
    "the relatively monotonic average flow ( shown in figure [ fig : r0 ] ) is obtained by averaging over this complex flow structure .        , but for the @xmath126 model.,width=245 ]    the stellar distribution used for the @xmath126 model ( obtained by sampling the @xmath126 distribution function , see equation  [ eq : frac ] and section  [ sec : starpos ] ) is shown in figure  [ fig : posr05 ] .",
    "the average flow variables as a function of spherical radius ( obtained by averaging over spherical surfaces , see above ) are compared with the solution obtained from the analytic model in figure [ fig : r05 ] .",
    "again , a reasonably good agreement is obtained between the analytic model and the average flow variables computed from the flow that results from the numerical simulation , except for the inner region of the cluster .    , but for the @xmath126 model.,width=302 ]      figure  [ fig : posr2 ] shows the stellar positions that results from sampling the @xmath131 distribution function .",
    "the stars are highly concentrated around the centre of the cluster .    , but for the @xmath131 model.,width=245 ]    figure  [ fig : r2 ] shows the angularly averaged velocity , density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the analytical solution has a non - zero , subsonic velocity and an infinite density at the central position of the cluster .",
    "substantial differences between the numerical and analytical solutions are found for radii smaller than @xmath132  pc .",
    "this is a direct result of the undersampling of the stellar distribution function which occurs as a result of the `` proximity criterion '' ( described in [ sec : starpos ] ) applied for placing the stars in the computational grid . for larger radii",
    ", a reasonable agreement between the analytical and numerical results is obtained .",
    "+     but for the @xmath131 model.,width=340 ]      figure  [ fig : posr25 ] shows the stellar positions that results from sampling the @xmath134 distribution function .",
    "the analytical solution and the angularly average flow variables ( obtained from the numerical simulation ) are shown in figure  [ fig : r25 ] .",
    "for this model , the analytic solution has a supersonic , outwards velocity in the inner region of the cluster .",
    "again we obtain substantial deviations between the analytic and numerical solutions in the central region of the cluster , and better agreement for larger radii .     for @xmath134 model.,width=245 ]     for @xmath134 model.,width=302 ]",
    "we have taken the density and temperature stratifications for the steady cluster wind flow configurations , and used them to compute the x - ray emission .",
    "we have done this by computing the emission coefficient in the @xmath135   kev photon energy range using the chianti atomic data base and software ( see dere et al . 2001 and references therein ) . for this calculation",
    ", it is assumed that the ionisation state of the gas corresponds to coronal ionisation equilibrium , and that the emission is in the low density regime ( i.  e. , that the emission coefficient is proportional to the square of the density ) .",
    "we then integrate this emission coefficient along lines of sight , which are assumed to be parallel to the @xmath136-axis of the computational grid .",
    "the x - ray maps computed in this way for the models with @xmath125 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath103 are shown in fig . 10 .    from these maps , it is clear that the x - ray emission is highly structured in all models .",
    "actually , some of the structures are seen in all four models , as the stellar position have been chosen with the same set of random numbers ( but not the same radial positions , see the discussion at the end of  3.2 ) .",
    "emission profiles for a line of sight at @xmath139 , @xmath136 = 0 for the four x - rays maps in figure  10.,width=377 ]    in figure 11 , we show the emission along a line of sight placed at @xmath139 , @xmath136=0 four x - ray maps of figure 10 .",
    "these cuts show that the @xmath125 and @xmath126 models have a structured but more or less constant emission within a radius of @xmath140  pc ( i.  e. , the inner 60  % of the cluster radius ) , with wings of lower emission extending to beyond the outer cluster boundary .",
    "the models with steeper stellar distribution functions ( i.  e. , with more negative values of @xmath17 ) show more compact emission structures .    finally , by integrating the x - ray emission over the whole emitting volume , we compute luminosities of 0.32 , 0.32 , 0.26 and 0.20 l@xmath3 for the @xmath125 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath103 , respectively . therefore , we find that the while the predicted maps differ quite appreciably between the different models , the x - ray luminosity does not depend strongly on the value of @xmath17 .",
    "we should note that because the emission coefficient is proportional to the square of the density , one can use equation ( 21 ) to deduce the scaling of the x - ray luminosity to other model parameters .",
    "for example , a supercluster with @xmath141 stars would have x - ray luminosities of @xmath142  l@xmath3 ( depending on the value of @xmath17 , see above ) .",
    "in this paper we have extended the analytic cluster wind model of paper i to the case of a non - uniform stellar distribution .",
    "in particular , we have studied the case of a radially dependent , @xmath143 power - law distribution .    of particular interest",
    "is the @xmath131 distribution , which corresponds to the stratification of a singular , isothermal , self - gravitating sphere .",
    "such a structure is of interest for modelling the wind from a gravitationally bound stellar cluster .",
    "power - law stellar distributions with other values of @xmath17 do not have a clear physical justification , but can be considered as a parametrization of stellar distributions with different degrees of central condensation .",
    "we find that for shallow distributions , with @xmath144 , the cluster wind has zero velocity in the cluster centre .",
    "however , for more negative @xmath17 values the cluster wind has a non - zero , outwards directed velocity ( subsonic for @xmath145 and supersonic for @xmath146 ) in the centre of the cluster .",
    "the solutions with a non - zero central velocity have an infinite central density for the cluster wind .",
    "we have then compared the analytic cluster wind solutions with 3d numerical simulations . for carrying out the simulations , we consider the winds from 100 stars , with a spatial distribution obtained by statistically sampling the appropriate stellar distribution function .",
    "we then carry out angular averages of the computed flow variables , and compare the radial dependence of these averages with the predictions obtained from the analytic model .    for different values of @xmath17",
    ", we obtain a good agreement between the analytic and numerical predictions in the outer regions of the cluster .",
    "however , the analytic and numerical solutions have large differences in the central region of the cluster . these differences are a direct result of the fact that only a small number of stars are present in this spatially reduced region , and therefore the continuous mass and energy source distribution assumed in the analytic model is inappropriate for describing the real cluster wind flow .",
    "finally , we have obtained predictions of the x - ray emission from our simulated cluster wind flows .",
    "our models have quite low @xmath147  l@xmath3 x - ray luminosities , as a result of the fact that only 100 stars were included ( due to the constraints imposed by the numerical resolution of the simulations ) . however ,",
    "the scaling laws of the analytic model imply that models with 20000 stars ( i.  e. , with the number of stars of a large supercluster ) will have x - ray luminosities of @xmath148  l@xmath3 ( see section 4 ) . at distances of @xmath132  mpc ( i.  e. , the distance to m  82 )",
    ", this would produce an x - ray flux of @xmath149 erg  s@xmath98  @xmath150 .",
    "such a flux is only 2  % of the x - ray flux observed for the arches cluster close to the galactic centre ( see yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2002 ) , but might be within range for possible future observations .",
    "an important remaining problem is that h@xmath17 emission has been observed from many superclusters .",
    "our models have gas temperatures in excess of @xmath151  k , and therefore do not produce such an emission .",
    "therefore , the observed h@xmath17 emission must be coming from another component , which could be the remnants of dense interstellar clouds which were present in the region when the cluster was formed .",
    "the presence of such dense , lower temperature structures within the cluster wind flow could be explored in the future with numerical simulations similar to the ones which we have shown in the present paper , but that need to include the radiative cooling .",

    "<S> we present analytic and numerical models of the ` cluster wind ' resulting from the multiple interactions of the winds ejected by the stars of a dense cluster of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case in which the distribution of stars ( i.  e. , the number of stars per unit volume ) within the cluster is spherically symmetric , has a power - law radial dependence , and drops discontinuously to zero at the outer radius of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out comparisons between an analytic model ( in which the stars are considered in terms of a spatially continuous injection of mass and energy ) and 3d gasdynamic simulations ( in which we include 100 stars with identical winds , located in 3d space by statistically sampling the stellar distribution function ) . from the analytic model </S>",
    "<S> , we find that for stellar distributions with steep enough radial dependencies the cluster wind flow develops a very high central density and a non - zero central velocity , and for steeper dependencies it becomes fully supersonic throughout the volume of the cluster ( these properties are partially reproduced by the 3d numerical simulations ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the wind solutions obtained for stratified clusters can differ dramatically from the case of a homogeneous stellar distribution ( which produces a cluster wind with zero central velocity , and a fully subsonic flow within the cluster radius ) . finally , from our numerical simulations we compute predictions of x - ray emission maps and luminosities , which can be directly compared with observations of cluster wind flows .    </S>",
