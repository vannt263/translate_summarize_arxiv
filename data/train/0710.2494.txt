    "it is essential to have a good model for the soft interactions of hadrons at high energies to , in particular , predict at the lhc , ( i ) the structure of underlying events , ( ii ) the value of the total cross section , @xmath0 and the behaviour of the elastic cross section , @xmath1 , and ( iii ) the probability of diffractive dissociation .",
    "moreover , it is extremely important to understand the asymptotic behaviour of high energy interactions in a partonic framework",
    ". this will give the possibility of simulating the underlying events using a monte carlo generator based on a theoretically justified description of soft interactions .",
    "in addition , we need such a model to account for the effects of the underlying event in high energy hard interactions and to calculate the survival factors of rapidity gaps in exclusive and other hard diffractive processes . finally it is crucial to have a good understanding of the spectra of leading nucleons , that is of the diffractive dissociation cross section , in order to describe extensive air showers and to interpret the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "first we have the very simple donnachie - landshoff parametrization @xcite of the high energy elastic amplitude , which is described in terms of simple poles in the complex angular momentum plane : namely the pomeron and secondary regge poles .",
    "the latter give a negligible contribution at tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "however this parametrization says nothing about the distribution of secondary particles in the underlying event .",
    "moreover , already at the lhc energy , @xmath6 tev , the amplitude @xmath7 violates the black disc unitarity limit at small impact parameters @xmath8 .",
    "we need to satisfy , at least , the two - particle @xmath9-channel unitarity relation , in order to respect the froissart bound , and to describe the elastic cross section , which is about 20 - 25@xmath10 of the total cross section in the tevatron to lhc energy range .",
    "this leads to the eikonal form of the elastic amplitude , see ( [ eq : elastamp ] ) in section 3 . to allow for the possibility of proton excitations we need to consider multichannel ( say @xmath11-channel ) eikonal models which include rescattering in the @xmath12 diffractive eigenstates @xcite .",
    "we will review the eikonal approach in the next section . at present one- and two - channel eikonal models",
    "are used to predict the lhc cross sections @xcite .",
    "a one - channel approach was used in @xcite , and two - channel eikonals were used in @xcite .",
    "however , even a multichannel eikonal is unable to account for diffractive dissociation into high - mass states .",
    "these processes are usually described in terms of regge theory with the help of the triple - pomeron vertex .",
    "the problem is that , after we allow for the low values of the probability , @xmath13 , that the rapidity gaps survive the eikonal rescattering , the value of the triple - pomeron coupling , @xmath14 , needed to describe the data ( @xmath15 ) , becomes rather large ; namely @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the nucleon - pomeron coupling , give @xmath18 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , when we account for more complicated enhanced diagrams we need a larger value of the bare triple - pomeron coupling . ] . as a result",
    "we can not neglect more complicated multi - pomeron diagrams containing a large number of triple - pomeron couplings .",
    "a specific set of such diagrams , known as `` fan '' diagrams , have been summed in refs .",
    "the selection of these fan diagrams is justified for proton - nuclei interactions or deep inelastic scattering .",
    "that is when the size of the incoming object is much smaller than the size of the `` target '' .",
    "in other words , we account for the multiple interactions with the large size `` target '' , but not with the `` beam '' particle , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fan ] .",
    "the summation of these diagrams leads to saturation , that is the amplitude @xmath19 constant at large @xmath9 .",
    "the problem is that the fan diagram approximation can only be used to describe the beginning of the approach to saturation .",
    "once we are near saturation it is not justified to neglect more complicated multi - pomeron graphs was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in refs .",
    "@xcite ; note that in @xcite , besides @xmath14 , more complicated multi - pomeron vertices were considered ] .        a good description of cern isr ",
    "tevatron data on @xmath20 was obtained in @xcite , where the high - mass diffractive dissociation was described phenomenologically and added to the two - channel eikonal .",
    "that is , high - mass diffraction was not generated from the underlying theory , but was included in terms of the _ leading _ triple - pomeron diagram , and then this contribution was added to the total proton opacity @xmath21 .",
    "the shortcomings of the existing approaches to describe soft interactions can be summarised as follows .",
    "first , it is not clear , a priori , how the results will change in going from a two- to a three- ( or more ) channel eikonal model .",
    "furthermore , we do not know how the results depend on the size ( that is , the form factor ) of each diffractive eigenstate @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath14 is not small , we can not neglect the more complicated multi - pomeron interactions interaction and therefore we neglect secondary reggeon contributions , and include only the pomeron . ] .    here",
    "we will consider a three - channel eikonal model .",
    "we will assume that the cross section of each eigenstate , @xmath23 ( that is , the coupling of the eigenstate to the pomeron ) is proportional to the square of the transverse size of the component , @xmath24 .",
    "this form is motivated , _ either _ by leading - order qcd , where @xmath25 , _ or _ by the assumption that each eigenstate has an opacity of the same shape with the same value of @xmath26 , such that the integrated coupling @xmath27",
    ". another possibility , which we will analyse , is to use the same form factor , that is the same size , for each component , as in @xcite .    by allowing for a different size for each component",
    ", we have the possibility to introduce , and to calculate the different partonic composition of each diffractive eigenstate .",
    "for instance , for a smaller size component , the evolution will start at a larger scale @xmath28 , and so there will be less gluons and other low @xmath29 partons radiated during the evolution .",
    "let us delay the inclusion of high - mass diffractive dissociation for the moment in order to first introduce the eikonal description of soft proton - proton interactions .",
    "this will allow low - mass diffractive excitations to be included .",
    "we will then have to describe how to incorporate the important contributions made by high - mass single and double proton dissociation .",
    "the high - mass dissociations have a crucial effect on the predictions for the lhc .",
    "unitarity plays a pivotal role in diffractive processes .",
    "the total cross section is intimately related to the elastic scattering amplitude and the scattering into inelastic final states via @xmath9-channel unitarity , @xmath30 , or  t t - t^= it^t [ eq : disct]with @xmath31 .",
    "first , we briefly recall the relevant features of the single - channel eikonal model .",
    "that is we focus on elastic unitarity .",
    "then `` disc @xmath32 '' is simply the discontinuity of @xmath32 across the two - particle @xmath9-channel cut . at high energies we have a sizeable inelastic component .",

    "the well known example of scattering by a black disc , with @xmath38 for @xmath39 , gives @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in general , we see that the absorption of the initial wave due to the existence of many inelastic channels leads , via @xmath9-channel unitarity , to diffractive dissociation .",
    "so much for elastic diffraction .",
    "now we turn to inelastic diffraction , which is a consequence of the _ internal structure _ of hadrons .",
    "this is simplest to describe at high energies , where the lifetime of the fluctuations of a fast hadron is large , @xmath42 , and during these time intervals the corresponding fock states can be considered as ` frozen ' .",
    "each hadronic constituent can undergo scattering and thus destroy the coherence of the fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the outgoing superposition of states will be different from the incident particle , and will most likely contain multiparticle states , so we will have _ inelastic _ , as well as elastic , diffraction .    to discuss inelastic diffraction , it is convenient to follow good and walker  @xcite , and to introduce states @xmath43 which diagonalize the @xmath32 matrix .",
    "such eigenstates only undergo elastic scattering . since there are no off - diagonal transitions , _",
    "j|t|_k= 0  jk , a state @xmath44 can not diffractively dissociate into a state @xmath45 .",
    "we have noted that this is not , in general , true for hadronic states , which are not eigenstates of the @xmath46-matrix , that is of @xmath32 . to account for the internal structure of the hadronic states , we have to enlarge the set of intermediate states , from just the single elastic channel , and to introduce a multichannel eikonal .",
    "we will consider such an example below , but first let us express the cross section in terms of the probability amplitudes @xmath47 of the hadronic process proceeding via the various diffractive eigenstates describes the probability that the diffractive eigenstate @xmath43 is not absorbed in the interaction .",
    "later we will see that the rapidity gap survival factors , @xmath13 , can be described in terms of such eikonal exponents . ]",
    "@xmath43 .",
    "let us denote the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes @xmath48 by @xmath49 , so that [ eq : b3 ] imt = afa^t _ j |f| _ k = f_k _ jk . now consider the diffractive dissociation of an arbitrary incoming state [ eq : b4 ] | j = _ k a_jk",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude for this state satisfies [ eq : b5 ] j |im  t| j = _ k |a_jk|^2",
    "f_k = f , where @xmath50 and where the brackets of @xmath51 mean that we take the average of @xmath52 over the initial probability distribution of diffractive eigenstates . after the diffractive scattering described by @xmath53 , the final state @xmath54 will , in general , be a different superposition of eigenstates from that of @xmath55 , which was shown in  ( [ eq : b4 ] ) . at high energies we may neglect the real parts of the diffractive amplitudes .",
    "then , for cross sections at a given impact parameter @xmath33 , we have [ eq : b6 ] & = & 2 j |t| j = 2 _ k |a_jk|^2 f_k = 2 f + & & + & = & | j |t| j |^2 = ( _ k |a_jk|^2 f_k ) ^2 = f ^2 + & & + & = & _ k | _ k |t| j |^2 = _ k",
    "|a_jk|^2 f_k^2 = f^2 .",
    "it follows that the cross section for the single diffractive dissociation of a proton , [ eq : b7 ] = f^2 - f ^2 , is given by the statistical dispersion in the absorption probabilities of the diffractive eigenstates . here",
    "the average is taken over the components @xmath44 of the incoming proton which dissociates .",
    "if the averages are taken over the components of both of the incoming particles , then in ( [ eq : b7 ] ) we must introduce a second index on @xmath52 , that is @xmath56 , and sum over @xmath44 and @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the sum is the cross section for single and double dissociation .",
    "note that if all the components @xmath43 of the incoming diffractive state @xmath55 were absorbed equally then the diffracted superposition would be proportional to the incident one and the inelastic diffraction would be zero . thus if , at very high energies , the amplitudes @xmath47 at small impact parameters are equal to the black disk limit , @xmath57 , then diffractive production will be equal to zero in this impact parameter domain and so will only occur in the peripheral @xmath33 region .",
    "a similar behaviour already takes place in @xmath58 ( and @xmath59 ) interactions at tevatron energies .",
    "hence the impact parameter structure of inelastic and elastic diffraction is drastically different in the presence of strong @xmath9-channel unitarity effects .",
    "the elastic amplitude originates mainly from the centre of the disk ( that is , from small @xmath33 ) , while dissociation comes from the periphery .",
    "hence it is important to pay special attention to the periphery of the proton , in impact parameter , @xmath33 , space .",
    "first , large values of @xmath33 are responsible for the small @xmath60 behaviour of the amplitude .",
    "second , the large @xmath33 region , where the optical density ( or opacity ) , @xmath61 , becomes small , gives the major contribution to the survival probability of rapidity gaps .",
    "it is clear that if we allow for the possibility of diffractive excitation , then we will enlarge the absorptive effect caused by the eikonal . as a consequence",
    "the results obtained by a one- and two - channel eikonal fit will be substantially different .",
    "however , once we fix the dispersion , ( [ eq : b7 ] ) , that is , once we fix the ratio , we can consider only ` low - mass ' proton excitations , within a limited interval of @xmath62 . ]",
    "@xmath63(low - mass)@xmath64 , it turns out that the inclusion of a third channel will not practically change the result .",
    "of course , with a three - channel eikonal we have too many parameters .",
    "we will therefore consider an extreme case where each channel has the same weight ; @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "otherwise the contribution of the eigenstate with the smallest weight will be less visible and the situation will be close to the 2-channel model .",
    "next , we fix the value of the dispersion , ( [ eq : b7 ] ) , _ i^2  -  _ i ^2  =  ( 1+^2)_i ^2 .",
    "[ eq : disp ] as a result the total probability of dissociation ( in the limit of small opacity , @xmath67 ) , _ sd^lowm/_el=2 ^ 2 , [ eq : fac2 ] will be the same in the two- and three - channel cases .",
    "here @xmath68 is the @xmath69-pomeron coupling , so the amplitude @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath68 ; the factor of 2 in ( [ eq : fac2 ] ) accounts for low - mass excitations of both the colliding beam particles .",
    "note that to describe the elastic scattering data in terms of a multichannel eikonal model , we have to increase the size of the intercept , @xmath71 , and to reduce the slope @xmath72 , of the bare pomeron trajectory , in comparison with the naive donnachie - landshoff amplitude , in order to compensate for the absorptive effects of multichannel eikonal rescattering @xcite .",
    "it was checked that the effects of the pion loop in the bare pomeron trajectory ( see @xcite ) can be mimicked by increasing the value of @xmath72 .",
    "thus , if we do not want @xmath73 accuracy , we can replace our previous two - channel description @xcite of the data by a simpler two - channel fit , which is suitable for the calculation of the rapidity gap survival factors for the different hard diffractive processes and to evaluate the soft cross sections @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath74 .",
    "an essential ingredient , in the prediction of the rate of a particular diffractive process , is the calculation of the suppression due to multi - pomeron exchanges .",
    "we assume that the rapidity gap is large enough that it will be populated by secondaries from soft rescattering ; that is , in an inelastic soft interaction , there is a negligible probability for a fluctuation with zero multiplicity within the large gap interval",
    ". then we can write the survival factor of the gap with respect to the @xmath75 soft interaction at fixed impact parameter @xmath33 as exp@xmath76 .",
    "this survival factor should be averaged over the full set of diffractive eigenstates and over the impact parameter @xmath33 .",
    "if we do not detect the outgoing protons the survival factor caused by eikonal rescattering is given by = , [ eq : c3 ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the probabilities of finding the partonic diffractive eigenstates @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the two colliding proton states @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , see ( [ eq : b4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath83 is the probability of producing the particular final system from the incoming eigenstates @xmath22 and @xmath44 .",
    "if one , or both , of the outgoing protons is observed , then we have to average the amplitude and not the cross section .",
    "for example when both protons are tagged with @xmath84 we have = | |^2 .",

    "we expect the channel with the smallest cross section to contain mainly valence quarks with larger @xmath29 , while the channels with larger cross sections will be due to sea quarks and gluons , concentrated at smaller values of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "in the eikonal approximation the interaction of two diffractive eigenstates , @xmath69 and @xmath43 was described by the opacity @xmath87 corresponding to the two - particle @xmath9-channel irreducible amplitude .",
    "this @xmath87 generates the complete two - particle reducible amplitude @xmath56 , f_ik(s , b )  =  1-e^-_ik/2 , see ( [ eq : elastamp ] ) .",
    "the connection between the irreducible amplitude @xmath88 and the full amplitude @xmath56 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] .",
    "the defect of the approach , where the irreducible amplitude @xmath89 of the ` @xmath75 ' interaction has been approximated by a single pole in the complex angular momentum plane , is that we are unable to separate the contribution coming from events with a rapidity gap from those of completely inelastic multiparticle processes .",
    "thus we are unable to identify high - mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "moreover , if we try to describe high - mass dissociation in the good - walker formalism we encounter the problem of double counting when the partons originating from the dissociation of the beam and ` target ' initial protons overlap in rapidities .",

    "note the second power in the denominator in ( [ eq : limit ] ) and , moreover the denominator contains 2exp(@xmath96 ) rather than exp(@xmath96 ) .",
    "this reflects the well known fact that the screening of the diffractive dissociation amplitude is twice as strong as that for the elastic amplitude .",
    "recall that eqs .",

    "the reason for the missing entries for @xmath270 for model ( a ) is explained in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a sample of the results for the total and the diffractive dissociation cross sections were presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1 ] , and for @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2 ] . in table 2",
    "we also list the values of the cross sections for models ( b2 ) and ( b3 ) at three energies , namely @xmath274 tev and @xmath275 gev .",
    "note that model ( b ) is favoured , for reasons explained below .",
    "we see that with increasing energy the cross sections violate the pumplin bound @xcite _ el  +  _ sd  +  _ dd  <  _ tot/2 .",
    "however this bound is only justified for low - mass dissociation described in terms of good - walker diffractive eigenstates .",
    "( actually the bound was originally proved for dissociation on nuclei . ) for the low - mass components of the diffractive dissociation cross sections we see that there is no contradiction with the bound .",
    "an important ingredient of the analyses of soft high energy hadron interactions are the data on _ diffractive dissociation_. the data that are available at present are fragmentary .",
    "no experiment has covered the whole kinematic range of @xmath60 and rapidity .",
    "moreover , at low @xmath90 and low @xmath60 it is hard to avoid contamination from elastic events . for these reasons we prefer to compare the theoretical predictions with measurements of differential cross sections , @xmath276 and @xmath277 , in regions where they were actually observed , rather than with integrated cross sections , @xmath63 and @xmath185 , which were obtained by extrapolating the data into unmeasured regions using some simplified model .    in order to further constrain the parameters of the model so as to obtain more precise predictions , it is important to make accurate measurements at collider energies , of the single diffractive dissociation cross section for low masses @xmath74 and of its @xmath60 dependence @xmath276 , and of central diffractive production @xmath278 .",
    "the latter two measurements will provide information on the transverse sizes of the various diffractive eigenstates @xmath69 .",
    "such measurements can be performed at the lhc , for example , in the totem experiment @xcite .",
    "we have considered two different models for the @xmath69-pomeron couplings : model ( a ) in which all the components have the same size , and model ( b ) in which the sizes differ , see ( [ eq : ma ] ) and ( [ eq : mb ] )",
    ". there are three observations which appear to favour model ( b ) .",
    "_ first _ , model ( b ) gives a somewhat better detailed description of the various data for @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , recall for model ( a3 ) we were required to choose a complicated form of the residue @xmath279 to avoid a contradiction with the data .",
    "_ second _ , model ( b ) predicts @xmath185 which is better agreement with cdf measurements enclosing @xmath120 and find @xmath280 mb at 1.8 tev and @xmath281 mb at 630 gev , as compared to the predictions of @xmath2824.4 mb and 3.7 mb , respectively , of model ( b2 ) . here",
    "@xmath283 denotes the portion of the cross section for double dissociation coming from the kinematic region where it was actually measured . ] .",
    "_ third _ , model ( a ) requires a very large dispersion @xmath250 of the pomeron-@xmath69 couplings , which tends to be incompatible with the data for soft reactions at fixed target energies , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at present we can not completely reject model ( a ) , and so we have also presented the results of this model to indicate the possible spread of the predictions .    in all the models the value of @xmath129 was about 1/3 , in agreement with the evaluation of @xmath14 based on the hera data for @xmath284 @xcite .    in our description of high energy `",
    "soft ' hadron - hadron interactions we need to start with a rather large ` bare pomeron ' intercept : @xmath271 with @xmath285 . note that this is considerably larger than the intercept @xmath286 of the naive effective donnachie - landshoff - type of pomeron @xcite .",
    "the reason is that it is necessary to compensate the effects of the screening corrections originating from the enhanced multi - pomeron diagrams .",
    "recall that in the present model we use the heavy pomeron approximation @xcite , that is we set the slope of the pomeron trajectory @xmath267 .",
    "nevertheless this extreme choice is still consistent with the data .",
    "the shrinkage of the elastic differential cross section data of fig .",
    "[ fig : r2 ] is reproduced in our approach by a stronger absorptive effect at low impact parameters with increasing energy .",
    "our preliminary estimates indicate that a small value of @xmath287 may possibly improve the description of the data will result in a smaller value of @xmath114 . ] , but we find a larger @xmath72 ( @xmath288 ) appears to be definitely ruled out , since the main shrinkage of the elastic peak comes from absorptive effects .",
    "in summary , we have been able , for the first time , to present a theoretically fully consistent description of high energy soft hadron interactions .",
    "the procedure incorporates both a multi - channel eikonal and multi - pomeron interactions . in terms of reggeon field theory",
    ", it sums up the eikonal diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] , together with the enhanced multi - pomeron diagrams like those in figs .",
    "[ fig : both ] and [ fig : loops ] . in terms of final states",
    "these diagrams generate processes with different densities of secondary particles .",
    "the eikonal diagrams generate processes like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : agk](a ) , while the enhanced multi - pomeron diagrams may generate processes with rapidity gaps , as well as those with different densities of secondaries in particular rapidity intervals as shown in fig .",
