    "it has been known for many decades that the distribution of the stellar velocities in the solar neighbourhood is far from isotropic . a longstanding problem in stellar dynamics ( or in recent times",
    "more appropriately called galactic dynamics ) has been the question of the shape and orientation of the velocity ellipsoid ( i.e. the three - dimensional distribution of velocities ) of stars in disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "the local ellipsoid has generated debate and research for at least a century .",
    "there still is no consensus on the question of the orientation of the longest axis of the velocity ellipsoid ( the `` tilt '' away from parallel to the plane ) at small and moderate distances from the symmetry plane of the galaxy ( but see cuddeford & amendt 1991a , b ) , which is of vital importance for attempts to estimate the local surface density of the galactic plane from vertical dynamics of stars .",
    "the radial versus tangential dispersion ratio is reasonably well understood as a result of the local sheer , which through the oort constants governs the shape of the epicyclic stellar orbits ( but see cuddeford &  binney 1994 and kuijken & tremaine 1994 for higher order effects as a result of deviations from circular symmetry ) .",
    "there are two general classes of models for the origin of the velocity dispersions of stars in galactic disks .",
    "the first , going back to spitzer & schwarzschild ( 1951 ) , is scattering by irregularities in the gravitational field , later identified with the effects of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "the second class of models can be traced back to the work of barbanis & woltjer ( 1967 ) , who suggested transient spiral waves as the scattering agent ; this model has been extended by carlberg & sellwood ( 1985 ) .",
    "recently , the possiblity of infall of satellite galaxies has been recognized as a third option ( e.g. velzquez &   white , 1999 ) .    in the solar neighbourhood",
    "the ratio of the radial and vertical velocity dispersion of the stars @xmath1 is usually taken as roughly 0.5 to 0.6 ( wielen 1977 ; see also gomez et al .",
    "1990 ) , although values on the order of 0.7 are also found in the literature ( woolley et al . 1977 ; meusinger et al .",
    "1991 ) . the value of this ratio can be used to test predictions for the secular evolution in disks and perhaps distinguish between the general classes of models .",
    "lacey ( 1984 ) and villumsen ( 1985 ) have concluded that the spitzer - schwarzschild mechanism is not in agreement with observations : the predicted time dependence of the velocity dispersion of a group of stars as a function of age disagrees with the observed age  velocity dispersion relation ( see also wielen 1977 ) , while it would not be possible for the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid @xmath2 to be less than about 0.7 ( but see ida et al .",
    "1993 )    jenkins & binney ( 1990 ) argued that it is likely that the dynamical evolution in the directions in the plane and that perpendicular to it could have proceeded with both mechanisms contributing , but in different manners .",
    "scattering by gmcs would then be responsible for the vertical velocity dispersion , while scattering from spiral irregularities would produce the velocity dispersions in the plane .",
    "the latter would be the prime source of the secular evolution with the scattering by molecular clouds being a mechanism by which some of the energy in random motions in the plane is converted into vertical random motions , hence determining the thickness of galactic disks .",
    "the effects of a possible slow , but significant accretion of gas onto the disks over their lifetime has been studied by jenkins ( 1992 ) , who pointed out strong effects on the time dependence of the vertical velocity dispersions , in particular giving rise to enhanced velocities for the old stars .",
    "the only other galaxy in which a direct measurement of the velocity ellipsoid has been reported , is ngc488 ( gerssen et al .",
    "ngc488 is a moderately inclined galaxy , which enables these authors to solve for the dispersions from a comparison of measurements along the major and minor axes .",
    "ngc488 is a giant sb galaxy with a photometric scale length of about 6 kpc ( in the _",
    "b_-band ) and an amplitude of the rotation curve of about 330 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the axis ratio @xmath4 is 0.70 @xmath5 0.19 ; this value , which is probably larger than that for the galaxy , suggests that the spiral irregularities mechanism should be relatively less important , in agreement with the optical morphology .",
    "the light distribution in galactic disks has in the radial direction an exponential behaviour ( freeman 1970 ) , characterised by a scale length @xmath6 . in the vertical direction",
    "at least away from the central layer of young stars and dust that is obvious in edge - on galaxies it turns out that the light distribution can also be characterised by an exponential scale height @xmath7 , which is independent of galactocentric distance ( van der kruit & searle 1981 , but see de grijs & peletier 1997 ) .",
    "it then is usually assumed that the three - dimensional light distribution traces the distribution of mass ; this seems justifiable since the light measured is that of the old disk population , which contains most of the stellar disk mass and dominates the light away from the plane . on general grounds",
    ", these two typical length scales are expected to be independent , the radial one resulting from the distribution of angular momentum in the protogalaxy ( e.g. van der kruit 1987 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 ) or that resulting from the merging of pre - galactic units in the galaxy s early stages , while the length scale in the @xmath8-direction would result from the subsequent , and much slower , disk heating and the consequent thickening of the disk .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear , therefore , that the two scale lengths should correlate .",
    "yet , they do bear a relation to the ratio of the velocity dispersions of the stars in the old disk population .",
    "the vertical one follows directly from hydrostatic equilibrium . in the radial direction",
    "it is somewhat indirect ; a relation between the radial scale length and the corresponding velocity dispersion comes about through conditions of local stability ( e.g. bottema 1993 ) .    in a recent study , de grijs ( 1997 , 1998",
    "; see also de grijs & van der kruit 1996 ) has determined the two scale parameters in a statistically complete sample of edge - on galaxies and found the ratio of the two ( @xmath6/@xmath7 ) to increase with later morphological type . in this paper we will examine this dataset in detail in order to investigate whether it can be used to derive information on the axis ratios of the velocity ellipsoid and help make progress in resolving the general issues described above .",
    "in an extensive study of stellar kinematics of spiral galaxies , bottema ( 1993 ) presented measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions in the disks of twelve spiral galaxies .",
    "this first reasonably sized sample represented a fair range of morphological types and luminosities , although it was not a complete sample in a statistical sense . in each galaxy",
    "he determined a fiducial value for the velocity dispersion , namely at one photometric ( _ b_-band ) scale length .",
    "he then found that this fiducial velocity dispersion correlated well with the absolute disk luminosity as well as with the maximum rotation velocity of the galaxy .",
    "his sample contained both highly inclined galaxies ( where the velocities in the plane are in the line of sight ) and close to face - on systems ( where one measures the vertical velocity dispersion ) ; when he forced the relations for the two classes of galaxies to coincide he found that a similar ratio between radial and vertical velocity dispersion as applicable for the solar neighbourhood was needed .",
    "bottema s empirical relation for velocity dispersion versus rotation velocity is @xmath9 whereas for velocity dispersion versus disk luminosity it reads ( in the form of absolute magnitude ) @xmath10    these relations can for any galaxy for which the photometry is available or for which the rotation curve is known be used to estimate the radial stellar velocity dispersion of the old disk stars at one photometric scale length from the center . doing this for the de grijs sample of edge - on galaxies and estimating the vertical velocity dispersion from the vertical scale height , one can in principle determine the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid for this entire sample .",
    "it would appear that this is a rather uncertain procedure , since one will have to assume a mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath11 ) in order to calculate the vertical velocity dispersion from the photometric parameters .",
    "we will show , however , that @xmath11 does not enter explicitely in the formula for the ratio of velocity dispersions .    we will list our assumptions : + @xmath12 the surface density of the disk has an exponential form as a function of galactocentric distance : @xmath13 @xmath12 the vertical distribution of density can be approximated by that of the isothermal sheet ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) , but we will use instead the subsequently suggested modification ( van der kruit 1988 ) @xmath14 a detailed investigation of the sample ( de grijs et al . 1997 ) shows indeed that the vertical light profiles are much closer to exponential than to the isothermal solution , although the mass density distribution most likely is less peaked than that of the light , since young populations with low velocity dispersions add significantly to the luminosity but little to the mass .",
    "then the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath15 can be calculated from @xmath16 the usual parameter @xmath17 used in the notation for the isothermal disk ( and in de grijs 1998 ) is @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to note that this formula assumes that the old stellar disk is self - gravitating .",
    "although this can be made acceptable for galaxies like our own at positions of a few radial scale lengths from the center ( see van der kruit & searle 1981 ) , it is improbable in late - type galaxies , which have significant amounts of gas in the disks , and we will need to allow for this .",
    "+ @xmath12 the mass - to - light ratio @xmath11 is constant as a function of radius .",
    "support for this comes from the observation by van der kruit & freeman ( 1986 ) and bottema ( 1993 ) that the vertical velocity dispersion in face - on spiral galaxies falls off with a scale length about twice that of the surface brightness ( but note that gerssen et al .",
    "1997 , could not confirm this for ngc488 ) , combined with the observed constant thickness of disks with galactocentric radius .",
    "+ @xmath12 we are not making any assumptions on the functional form of the dependence of the radial velocity dispersion or the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the observed radial stellar velocity dispersions in bottema s sample are consistent with a drop - off @xmath19 , in which case this axis ratio would be constant with galactocentric distance . however , over the range considered the data can be fitted also with a radial dependence for the radial velocity dispersion in which the parameter @xmath0 for local stability against axisymmetric modes ( toomre 1964 ) is constant with radius ( @xmath20 ; see van der kruit & freeman 1986 ) .",
    "the definition of toomre s ( 1964 ) parameter @xmath0 for local stability against axisymmetric modes is @xmath21 disks are stabilised at small scales through the jeans criterion by random motions ( up to the radius of the jeans mass ) and for larger scales by differential rotation .",
    "toomre s condition states that the minimum scale for stability by differential rotation should be no larger than the jeans radius .",
    "+ @xmath12 we assume that spiral galaxies have flat rotation curves with an amplitude @xmath22 over all but their very central extent .",
    "this assumption implies that we may write the epicyclic frequency @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the oort constants .",
    "+ first we will look into the background of the bottema relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( see also van der kruit 1990 ; bottema 1993 , 1997 ) .    evaluating toomre s @xmath0 at @xmath27 and using the expression for the epicyclic frequency above",
    ", we find @xmath28 using @xmath29 and the total disk luminosity from @xmath30 we get @xmath31    neither in the sample of galaxies that bottema used to define his relations , nor in our sample of edge - on systems do we have galaxies with unusually low surface brightness .",
    "it seems therefore justified to assume that for the galaxies considered we have a reasonably constant central surface brightness ( freeman 1970 ; van der kruit 1987 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for _",
    "b_-magnitudes arcsec@xmath34 .",
    "so , if @xmath35 , @xmath0 and @xmath36 are constant between galaxies , we see that the fiducial velocity dispersion depends only on the disk luminosity and the rotation velocity .",
    "bottema s relation ( 1 ) can then be reconciled with eq .",
    "( 9 ) , if we have @xmath37 this is approximately the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) ; not precisely , since we use the disk luminosity and not that of the galaxy as a whole ( however , for late - type galaxies this would be a minor difference ) ( see van der kruit 1990 , p. 199 ) .",
    "performing such a fit to bottema s data gives a curve that is only marginally different from a straight line over his range of absolute magnitudes ( only a few km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "so , eq . ( 2 ) should only be seen as an empirical fit of the data to a straight line , although these data are equally consistent with the dependence following from eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 11 ) . ] .",
    "so , we see that bottema s relation ( 1 ) follows directly from toomre s stability criterion in exponential disks with flat rotation curves as long as eq . ( 11 ) holds .",
    "the proportionality constant in eq .",
    "( 11 ) can be fixed using the parameters for the milky way galaxy and for ngc 891 as given in van der kruit ( 1990 ) .",
    "these two galaxies have @xmath38 and @xmath39 mpc@xmath3 . ] .",
    "this gives @xmath40 and using also eq .",
    "( 10 ) we get @xmath41 > from this we find with bottema s relation ( 1 ) , that @xmath42 . in a somewhat different , but comparable manner , bottema ( 1993 ) has also concluded that this product is of order 5 .",
    "we now turn to the vertical velocity dispersion . evaluating the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium ( 5 ) at galactocentric distance @xmath43",
    "we find @xmath44 and can thus calculate the vertical velocity dispersion from @xmath45    finally we examine the ratio of the two velocity dispersions . if we eliminate @xmath46 between eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 14 ) we obtain @xmath47 and with eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath48    note that due to the elimination of the surface density also the mass - to - light ratio has dropped out of this equation and the result is independent of any assumption on @xmath11 .",
    "( 17 ) translates the ratio of the two length scales to that of the corresponding velocity dispersions and the underlying physics can be summarized as follows . in the vertical direction",
    "the length scale and the velocity dispersion relate through dynamical equilibrium . in the radial direction",
    "the velocity dispersion is related to the epicyclic frequency through the local stability condition , which is proportional to the rotation velocity .",
    "the `` tully - fisher relation '' then relates this to the integrated magnitude and hence to the size and length scale of the disk .",
    "one should be careful in the use of eq .",
    "( 17 ) , since in practice photometric scale lengths are wavelength dependent and its derivation and therefore the numerical constant is valid only at one exponential _ surface density _ scale length .",
    "the purpose of presenting it here is only to show that , if the two velocity dispersions are derived in a consistent manner from eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 14 ) or alternatively eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 15) , the assumption used for @xmath11 drops out in the resulting ratio .",
    "the sample of edge - on disk galaxies of de grijs ( 1998 ) contains 46 systems for which the structural parameters of the disks have been determined ( including a bulge / disk separation in the analysis ) . from this sample we take those for which rotation velocities have been derived in a uniform manner ( mathewson et al .",
    "1992 ; data collected in de grijs 1998 , table 4 ) as well as those for which the galactic foreground extinction in the _ b_-band is less than 0.25 magnitudes . for this remaining sample of 36 galaxies",
    "we perform the following calculations : + @xmath12 from the total magnitudes in de grijs ( 1998 , table 6 ) we obtain the integrated _ b_- and _ i_-magnitudes of the disk .",
    "+ @xmath12 using the radial scale length as measured in the _ i_-band we calculate the central ( face - on ) surface brightness of the disk from its _ i_-band integrated luminosity .",
    "so , we do not use eq .",
    "( 10 ) for a constant central surface brightness .",
    "+ @xmath12 then we use one or both of the two bottema relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to estimate the radial velocity dispersion at one photometric scale length ( by definition in the _ b_-band ) . where we can do this with both relations , the ratio between the two estimates is 1.11 @xmath5 0.19 .",
    "this is not trivial , as the rotation velocities and disk luminosities are determined completely independently ( and by different workers ) and only the one using the absolute magnitude needs an assumption for the distance scale .",
    "+ @xmath12 then using eq .",
    "( 15 ) , we estimate the vertical velocity dispersion at one photometric scale length in the _ i_-band . for this",
    "we need a value for the mass - to - light ratio and we will discuss this first .",
    "we found , that through eq .",
    "( 13 ) bottema s relation ( 1 ) provides a value for @xmath49 of about 5.7 .",
    "so we make a choice for @xmath0 rather than for @xmath11 . it has become customary to assume values of @xmath0 of order 2 , mainly based on the numerical simulations of sellwood & carlberg ( 1984 ) , who find their disks to settle with @xmath50 1.7 at all radii . in principle",
    "we can use the observed properties of the galaxy to fix @xmath0 from eq .",

    "( 1 ) ) can provide further support for the choice of @xmath0 , along the lines of the discussion in van der kruit & freeman ( 1986 ) . in the first place we recall the condition for the prevention of swing amplification in disks ( toomre 1981 ) , as reformulated by sellwood ( 1983 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of spiral arms .",
    "for a flat rotation curve this can be rewritten as @xmath58 with eq .",
    "( 1 ) this becomes @xmath59 .",
    "considering that the coefficient in eq .",
    "( 1 ) has an uncertainty of order 15% , this tells us that we have to assume @xmath0 at least of order 2 to prevent strong barlike ( _ m_=2 ) disturbances in the disk .",
    "a similar argument can be made using the global stability criterion of efstathiou et al .",
    "this criterion states that for a galaxy with a flat rotation curve and an exponential disk , global stability requires a dark halo and @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the total mass of the disk .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath62^{1/2 } { \\rm exp } \\left ( -{r \\over { 2h } } \\right ) \\simgt 1.1,\\ ] ] and , when evaluated at @xmath52 , yields with eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath63 , and therefore also implies that @xmath0 should be at least about 2 .",
    "efstathiou et al . have also come to this conclusion for our galaxy , with the use of local parameters for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "having adopted a value for @xmath0 and through this a value for @xmath55 , we will have to convert it to @xmath64 .",
    "for this we need a @xmath65 colour for the disks . from the fits of de",
    "grijs ( 1998 ) we find that the total _ disk _ magnitudes show a rather large variation in colour ; for the sample used here @xmath65 has a mean value of 1.9 , but the r.m.s .",
    "scatter is 0.8 magnitudes . in his discussion ,",
    "de grijs ( 1998 ) suspects a systematic effect of the internal dust in the disks ( particularly on the _ b_-magnitudes , which is another reason for us to use the @xmath22-version of the bottema relation ( eq .",

    ". instead we turn to the discussion of de jong ( 1996b ) , who compares his surface photometry of less inclined spirals to star formation models . from his table 3",

    "+ the effect of radial metallicity variations on the scale length is probably very small ; these gradients in the older stellar populations are in any case expected to be significantly less than in the interstellair medium .",
    "this is so , because in models for galactic chemical evolution the mean stellar metallicity of the stars approximates the ( effective ) yield , while that in the gas grows to much large values in most models ( van der kruit 1990 , p. 322 ) .",

    "but in our derivations we have not taken into account the effect of the hi on the effective velocity dispersion to be used in the evaluation of the @xmath0-parameter .",
    "the effect of the hi is a decrease of the effective velocity dispersion and therefore in @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the assumed value should in reality be decreased on average , but beyond this numerical effect , it does not affect our results .",
    "the effects just discussed can produce errors in the estimated velocity dispersions of the order of 10 to 20%  each .",
    "the final result of the dispersion ratios in fig .",
    "3 may therefore be wrong by a few tenths , which is comparable to the scatter in that figure .",
    "however , we have no cause to suspect that we have introduced serious systematic effects that would be strong functions of the rotation velocity or the morphological type and the lack of correlation of the axis ratio with these properties is unlikely to be an artifact of our analysis .    we conclude that it is in principle possible to infer information on the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid from a sample of edge - on galaxies for which both the radial scale length as well as the vertical scale height have been measured .",
    "the result , however shows much scatter , most of which is a result of the necessary assumptions .",
    "there is one significant improvement that can be made and that is the direct observation of the stellar velocity dispersion in these disks .",
    "that this is feasible in practice for edge - on systems has been shown by bottema et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1991 ) .",
    "the observed velocity profiles can be corrected for the line - of - sight effects , giving the tangential velocity dispersion , which through the observed shape of the rotation curve can be turned into the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "although a time consuming programme , we believe that it is worth doing for two reasons : ( 1 ) it will set both versions of the bottema relation on a firmer footing .",
    "( 2 ) the uncertainties in the analysis above can likely be significantly diminished by direct measurement of the radial velocity dispersion rather than having to infer it from the rotation velocity or the disk absolute magnitude .",

    "<S> the spatial distribution of stars in a disk of a galaxy can be described by a radial scale length and a vertical scale height . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of these two scale parameters contains information on the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid , i.e. the ratio of the vertical to radial stellar velocity dispersions of the stars , at least at some fiducial distance from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the radial velocity dispersion correlates well with the amplitude of the rotation curve and with the disk integrated magnitude , as was found by bottema ( 1993 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these relations can be understood as the result of the stellar disk being ( marginally ) stable against local instabilities at all length scales . </S>",
    "<S> this is expressed by toomre s well - known criterion , which relates the sheer in the rotation to a minimum value that the radial stellar velocity dispersion should have for stability for a given surface density . via the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) relation , </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion then becomes related to the integrated magnitude and hence to the scale length . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical velocity dispersion relates directly to the scale height through hydrostatic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the ratio of the two length scales relates to the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid only through the toomre parameter @xmath0 and in particular does not require a choice of the mass - to - light ratio or a distance scale . </S>",
    "<S> + we have applied this to the statistically complete sample of edge - on galaxies , for which de grijs ( 1997 ) has performed surface photometry and has determined the length scales in the stellar light distribution . </S>"
