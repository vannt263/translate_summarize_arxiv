    "according to the theory of relativity or quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the rest mass of photon should be exactly zero .",
    "however , even if the photon rest mass is not zero , qed and classical electromagnetism remain intact @xcite .",
    "this is because a non - zero photon mass would not damage gauge invariance of the first kind ( which would lead to non - conservation of charge ) , but would only damage the gauge invariance of the second kind .",
    "thus , the question of the photon mass is experimental , since it is impossible to fully prove that the photon rest mass is exactly zero via experiments .",
    "the only experimental strategy is to place ever tighter upper limits on photon rest mass . due to the uncertainty principle",
    ", there is an ultimate upper limit of photon rest mass @xcite , e.g. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 corresponds to the age of universe .",
    "however , such an upper limit is extremely difficult to place .    from the theoretical point of view , the photon - mass correction to maxwell s equations would cause changes to the classical electromagnetic properties",
    "one can then constrain the photon mass through testing these properties .",
    "so far , the photon mass has been constrained via different methods , which are divided into secure and speculative results @xcite .",
    "the former includes frequency dependence of the speed of light ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , dispersion in the ionosphere ( @xmath10 ) @xcite , coulomb s law ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , jupiter s magnetic field ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , and solar wind magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the latter includes extended lakes method ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , higgs mass for photon ( no limit feasible ) @xcite , cosmic magnetic fields ( @xmath15 ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "testing the correctness of massless photon is one of the most intriguing tasks in modern physics .",
    "if the photon has nonzero mass , the dispersion relation would be @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the photon mass ( see appendix ) .",
    "this is the standard energy - momentum expression in the special theory of relativity , which is similar to the plasma dispersion relation ( with the plasma frequency @xmath19 replaced by @xmath20 ) .",
    "this dispersion relation means that photons with different energies have different velocities .",
    "one important requirement of the energy - momentum equation is that the frequency of the free electromagnetic wave must satisfy @xmath21 , or @xmath22 . for the magnetic dipole radiation in pulsars , the angular frequency of",
    "the electromagnetic wave is equal to the angular frequency of rotation , i.e. @xmath23 . one natural question arises : what happens if @xmath24 for a magnetic dipole ?",
    "in this paper , we propose a new method to obtain a limit of the photon mass by applying spindown information of pulsars .",
    "traditional pulsars are rapidly spinning magnetized neutron stars , but white dwarf pulsars have been theoretical expected and recently proven to exist @xcite . the rotational kinetic energy luminosity is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the pulsar mass , @xmath27 is the pulsar radius , and @xmath28 is the angle velocity .",
    "observations show that @xmath29 in general , i.e. pulsars spin down .",
    "since gravitational wave spindown is negligible for slow - rotators such as radio pulsars , magnetars , and wd pulsars , pulsar spindown is naturally attributed to electromagnetic torques ( due to magnetic dipole radiation and wind power ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation from the rotating magnetosphere in the vacuum can sufficiently clarify the main properties of radio pulsars , including the pulsar spin down , stable radio sequence and so on .",
    "for @xmath30 , the energy losses of the vacuum magnetic dipole radiation energy is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the polar magnetic field , and @xmath33 is the angle between magnetic axis and rotation axis .",
    "the radiation energy originates from the rotational kinetic energy of the pulsar , leading to the pulsar spinning down .",
    "we first calculate the magnetic dipole radiation with @xmath34 . following @xcite ( see appendix ) , we obtain the radiation power of the magnetic dipole field in vacuum : @xmath35 for @xmath36 ; @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the magnetic dipole moment . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation power reduces to the classical result , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "we define @xmath42 to characterize the correction of non - zero photon mass effect .",
    "the @xmath43 relation for the vacuum case is presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "interestingly , if @xmath44 , the magnetic dipole radiation power drops to zero , leading to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in the vacuum case , one can use the spin - down observation of the pulsars with the longest period to constrain the photon mass , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath18 upper limit is inversely proportional to @xmath1 , pulsars with longer period would give more stringent constraints .",
    "for neutron - star radio pulsars , the longest - period one is psr j2144 - 3933 @xcite with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and spin - down luminosity @xmath49 . for magnetars ,",
    "the longest - period one is 1es 1841 - 045 @xcite with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . for the wd pulsars , some magnetized wds @xcite with @xmath53",

    "the mean luminosity of ar scorpii is @xmath56 , which includes the thermal emission of @xmath57 from the stellar components .",
    "therefore , the non - thermal emission from ar scorpii could be comfortably powered by the magnetic dipole radiation of the white dwarf @xcite .",
