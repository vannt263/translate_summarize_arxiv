    "within an effective field theory heavy particles are frozen and reduced to static sources , whereas active , light particles are treated as dynamical degrees of freedom . in order to describe the dynamics , an effective lagrangian is constructed which incorporates all relevant symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns of the underlying fundamental theory .    for the strong interactions the corresponding fundamental theory is quantum chromodynamics which has quark and gluon fields as explicit degrees of freedom in the lagrangian . due to confinement , however , neither quarks nor gluons are observed as free particles in nature ; they rather combine to colorless objects , to hadrons and possibly glueballs",
    ". a closer look at the hadronic spectrum reveals a characteristic gap which separates the eight lightest pseudoscalar mesons ",
    "the three pions , the four kaons and the eta  from the other hadrons , such as the vector mesons or the nucleons .",
    "this pattern can be explained as spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian with massless quarks which leads to eight goldstone bosons . due to the actual finite size of the quark",
    "masses the ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons acquire small masses and are identified with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath2 .",
    "hadron physics at low energies is governed by the eight goldstone bosons and can be described in an efficient way by the effective field theory of qcd , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "chpt provides a model - independent framework with the same symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns as qcd .",
    "systematically developed first in the mesonic sector by gasser and leutwyler @xcite , it can be extended to include baryons , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in this overview",
    ", we will focus on applications of baryon chpt for three light flavors with a particular emphasis on recent developments and remaining challenges in this field .    in the next section general construction principles for the effective lagrangian",
    "are outlined .",

    "results of axial vector couplings as well as ordinary nonleptonic and radiative weak hyperon decays are presented in secs .",
    "in this section , some guiding principles will be presented for the construction of the effective lagrangian .",
    "as qcd is invariant under chiral @xmath1 transformations in the limit of massless up , down and strange quarks , the effective lagrangian @xmath4 decomposes in the following way @xmath5 with @xmath6 being invariant under chiral @xmath1 transformations .",
    "the second term incorporates chiral symmetry breaking patterns due to non - zero quark masses @xmath7 and vanishes in the chiral limit of massless quarks .",
    "the quark masses are assumed to be small so that the explicitly chiral symmetry breaking terms in @xmath8 can be treated perturbatively .",
    "let us first restrict ourselves to the purely mesonic sector .",
    "the eight goldstone bosons are most conveniently summarized in a matrix @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pseudoscalar decay constant in the chiral limit and @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 \\phantom{+ }   \\pi^- &   -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\pi^0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6 } } \\eta & \\phantom{+ } k^0\\\\[8pt ] \\phantom{+ } k^- &   \\phantom{+ } \\bar{k}^0 & \\phantom{+ } - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6 } } \\eta   \\end{array}\\right ) .\\ ] ] the effective lagrangian is a function of @xmath14 and the quark mass matrix @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and is expanded in powers of @xmath17 and @xmath18 which amounts to an expansion in powers of meson momenta and masses .",
    "for @xmath19 we obtain the chiral expansion @xmath20 with the superscript @xmath21 denoting the @xmath22 chiral order . as the lagrangian is a lorentz scalar ,",
    "only even chiral powers are allowed .",
    "the leading term @xmath23 ( omitting for the moment external vector and axial vector fields ) reads @xmath24 [ \\phi,\\partial^\\mu \\phi ]   \\rangle   + \\ldots \\ ; , \\ ] ] where we have expanded @xmath25 in the meson fields @xmath12 .",
    "the first term in the @xmath12 expansion is the kinetic piece of the meson propagators , while the second term represents a four - meson interaction with a coupling constant fixed by chiral symmetry .",
    "vertices with higher powers in @xmath12 are denoted by the ellipsis and @xmath26 is the trace in flavor space . at higher chiral orders , however ,",
    "new additional coupling constants appear that need to be determined by experiment .    the explicitly chiral symmetry breaking piece @xmath8 is expanded analogously @xmath27 with the leading term @xmath28 the quark mass matrix counts as second chiral order and always enters in combination with @xmath29 , the order parameter of spontaneous symmetry violation . taken by itself , @xmath17 depends on the running scale of qcd , whereas the product @xmath30 is renormalization group invariant .    the effective field theory can be extended to include the ground state @xmath0 baryon octet @xmath31 consisting of the nucleons and hyperons which are collected in a @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 \\phantom{+ }   \\sigma^- &   -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sigma^0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6 } } \\lambda & \\phantom{+ } n\\\\[8pt ] \\phantom{+ } \\xi^- &   \\phantom{+ } \\xi^0 & \\phantom{+ } - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6 } } \\lambda   \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] and at leading order in the baryonic sector the effective lagrangian reads @xmath34 \\rangle .\\ ] ] @xmath35 is the common octet baryon mass in the chiral limit , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the axial vector couplings of the nucleons which can be determined from hyperon beta decays .",

    "the inclusion of external vector and axial vector fields in the effective field theory , _",
    "e.g. _ , in order to describe semileptonic baryon decays or processes with photon fields , promotes the global chiral symmetry to a local one .",

    "one finds agreement at the 2% level .",
    "the inclusion of baryons introduces a new scale @xmath56 which is close to the scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath57 . strictly speaking ,",
    "the scale @xmath56 spoils the chiral counting scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ higher loops contribute to lower chiral orders .",
    "however , the power counting can be reestablished by treating the fermions as heavy sources in the non - relativistic framework of heavy baryon chpt @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can evaluate the loops in the relativistic framework with infrared regularization by isolating in the loop integrals the infrared singularities due to the goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "another important question is whether the strange quark is light enough to be in the chiral regime and if it is included appropriately within the standard @xmath0 framework of chpt . in qcd",
    "the values of the current quark masses at @xmath58 gev in the @xmath59 scheme are @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 mev @xcite .",
    "thus the masses of the up and down quark , @xmath63 , are light compared to any hadronic scale , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath64 mev .",
    "the mass of the strange quark , on the other hand , is comparable in size , @xmath65 .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to question whether @xmath1 chiral symmetry is a realistic starting point for a systematic expansion in symmetry breaking interactions . at the level of the effective theory ,",
    "the relevant expansion parameter is given by the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "one may prefer to consider the kaon as a heavy particle and treat it as a heavy source as , _",
    "e.g. _ , done in heavy kaon chpt @xcite . here",
    "we follow the standard scenario of @xmath0 chpt in which the strange quark is treated on equal footing as the up and down quarks .",
    "having set up the effective lagrangian , we now proceed by calculating quantities in the scalar sector of baryon chpt : the baryon masses and the @xmath3 terms . at second chiral order quark masses",
    "enter the baryonic lagrangian @xmath68 \\rangle\\ ] ] with unknown parameters @xmath69 to be determined from experiment . utilizing this lagrangian , one calculates the mass splittings of the baryon octet at leading order in symmetry breaking .",
    "we work in the isospin limit @xmath70 so that there are only four different baryon masses , @xmath71 , and obtain @xmath72 note that we have absorbed the constant contributions from the @xmath73 term to the masses into @xmath74 .",
    "thus the four octet baryon masses are effectively represented in terms of three parameters which leads to a sum rule , the gell - mann  okubo mass relation , @xmath75 satisfied experimentally to about 3% . by going to higher chiral orders one expects to even ameliorate the situation .",
    "in general , the chiral expansion of the masses reads @xmath76 with the leading non - analytic contribution at third chiral order and chiral logarithms at fourth chiral order are not shown explicitly .",
    "a complete one - loop calculation has been performed in the heavy baryon approach to fourth chiral order in @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath56 has been factored out and the numbers denote the relative size of the contributions at zeroth , second , third and fourth chiral order , respectively . due to the proliferation of new unknown coupling constants at fourth chiral order an exact fit to the baryon octet masses is possible , but no clear statement can be made on the convergence of the chiral expansions . in @xcite",
    "the loop integrals have been evaluated in dimensional regularization , where the large non - analytic corrections at third chiral order arise from the integral @xmath78 \\ , [ k^2 - m^2 + i \\epsilon ] }   = i \\delta_{ij }",
    "\\frac{i(m)}{24 \\pi}\\ ] ] which in dimensional regularization is calculated to be @xmath79 and is sizeable for kaon and eta loops .",
    "such large non - analytic contributions occur , since baryons are treated as point like particles within the effective theory , although they have a finite size of about 1 fm .",
    "one must therefore suppress the short distance portions of loop integrals which are not described appropriately by chiral physics .",
    "this can be achieved , _",
    "e.g. _ , by utilizing a simple dipole regulator @xcite @xmath80 however , the specific choice of the regulator is not important as long as it maintains the relevant symmetries . the insertion of the dipole regulator in eq .",
    "[ integral ] yields @xmath81 and it is verified that the dipole regulator maintains indeed chiral symmetry , as the power divergences proportional to @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be absorbed into @xmath56 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the value of the cutoff @xmath83 must be chosen in such a way that it suppresses the short distance portion of the integral but keeps the low energy part .",
    "therefore , the phenomenologically relevant cutoffs are in the range @xmath85 .    in table",
    "[ table:1 ] the non - analytic contributions from the integral in eq .",
    "[ integral ] to the baryon masses are given both for dimensional and cutoff regularization ( in units of gev ) .",
    "clearly , utilization of a cutoff ameliorates convergence problems from large loop effects .",
    ".non - analytic contributions to the baryon masses in gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    one expects to improve the situation by going to higher chiral order , but the inclusion of the lowest non - analytic contributions from chiral loops leads to significant @xmath0 breaking which is in disagreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "again , application of a cutoff regulator brings the chiral corrections under control and leads to a well - behaved chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "the nonleptonic weak decays are the dominant hadronic decay mode of the hyperons .",
    "there are seven such decays : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the matrix elements of the decays are described in terms of two amplitudes , a parity - violating @xmath93 wave , @xmath94 , and a parity - conserving @xmath95 wave , @xmath31 , @xmath96 for more than three decades nonleptonic hyperon decays have been examined using effective field theories and there remain two important issues on the theoretical side .",
    "the first one is the @xmath97 rule which states that the @xmath98 amplitudes are suppressed with respect to the @xmath97 counterparts by factors of about twenty .",
    "this suppression exists also in kaon nonleptonic decay and despite considerable theoretical efforts still no simple explanation for its validity is available .",
    "note , however , that there may be possibly a @xmath97 rule violation in hypernuclear decay @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", it is justified to neglect the @xmath98 amplitudes .",
    "isospin symmetry of the strong interactions implies then three relations for both @xmath93 and @xmath95 waves , so that we end up with eight independent decay amplitudes .",
    "the second problem is the so - called @xmath93 and @xmath95 wave puzzle .",

    "the square denotes a weak vertex , while the circle is a strong vertex .",
    "baryons and pions are represented by solid and dashed lines , respectively.,width=491 ]    when trying to fit the data , it turns out that a reasonable simultaneous fit both to @xmath93 and @xmath95 waves is not possible .",
    "a good @xmath93 wave fit can be obtained , but this yields a poor @xmath95 wave description . on the other hand , a good @xmath95 wave representation yields a poor @xmath93 wave fit . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", one must go beyond leading order . in @xcite",
    "the leading non - analytic corrections from the goldstone boson loops were computed , but no local counterterms were considered .",
    "the resulting @xmath93 wave predictions no longer agreed with the data , and the corrections for the @xmath95 waves were even larger .",
    "jenkins reinvestigated this topic by explicitly including spin-3/2 decuplet fields in the effective theory and was able to restore good agreement between experiment and theory for the @xmath95 waves , although the description for the @xmath95 waves was not satisfactory @xcite .",
    "a complete one - loop calculation has been performed in @xcite which introduces more coupling constants than there exist data .",
    "an exact fit is possible , but not unique , even when reducing the number of counterterms by utilizing resonance saturation .",
    "it is unclear what the underlying physics is and the actual values of the couplings remain undetermined .",
    "another intriguing possibility was examined by le yaouanc et al .",
    ", who assert that a reasonable fit for both @xmath93 and @xmath95 waves can be provided by appending pole contributions from @xmath103 states to the @xmath93 waves @xcite .",
    "their calculations were performed in a simple constituent quark model and appear to provide a resolution of the @xmath93 and @xmath95 wave dilemma . in @xcite the validity of this approach has been considered in chpt . adding the contributions from the lowest lying 1/2@xmath104 and 1/2@xmath105 baryon resonant states to the tree level results appears to provide a satisfactory picture of nonleptonic hyperon decays .",
    "the weak contact interactions of these resonances with the ground state baryon octet are sizeable and parametrize effects from even higher energies .",
    "alternatively , the importance of final state interactions has been investigated within a chiral unitary approach based on coupled channels @xcite . in this approach",
    "the baryon resonances are generated dynamically instead of being included explicitly and the phase shifts of @xmath106 scattering are reproduced at the relevant energies which guarantees the accurate inclusion of the final state interactions .",
    "one observes that final state interactions have larger effects than usually assumed ; they are greater than 10% and should not be omitted .",
    "although the inclusion of final state interactions improves the overall fit of @xmath101 and @xmath102 to the data , a reasonable description is not obtained .",
    "this emphasizes again the importance of physics from higher energies which enters in the effective field theory via higher order weak contact interactions .",
    "the weak radiative hyperon decays @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are described by @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath36 being the parity - conserving @xmath115 and parity - violating @xmath116 amplitudes , respectively . in the @xmath0 limit",
    "hara s theorem requires the vanishing of @xmath117 for decays between baryon states of a common @xmath25-spin multiplet ( interchange of @xmath93 and @xmath118 quark ) : @xmath119 @xcite . in the real world",
    "one expects about 20% @xmath0 breaking effects and thus a small photon asymmetry @xmath120 but this is in contradiction to the near maximal value of the asymmetry parameter measured experimentally in polarized @xmath121 : @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "at lowest order in chpt only baryon pole diagrams contribute leading to a vanishing parity - violating amplitude @xmath36 and asymmetry parameter @xmath123 for all decays .",
    "recent work involving the calculation of chiral loops has also not led to a resolution , although slightly larger asymmetries could be accommodated @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of intermediate @xmath124 states , on the other hand , has been argued to lead to a resolution of the asymmetry problem in radiative decay , similar to the case of the @xmath93 and @xmath95 wave puzzle for ordinary hyperon decay @xcite .",
    "this claim could be confirmed within the chiral framework by including again the 1/2@xmath104 and 1/2@xmath105 baryon resonant states .",
    "the same weak contact interactions as in ordinary hyperon decay contribute and yield relatively large asymmetries @xcite .",
    "we conclude by noting that @xmath0 chpt is an appropriate tool to investigate properties and decays of hyperons . despite recent progress challenging problems remain as illustrated above such that the study of hyperons continues to be an interesting and active field .",
