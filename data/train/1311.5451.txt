    "the relativistic heavy ion collisions provide the unique way to create a new state of hot deconfined qcd matter known as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "to measure and understand the properties of this qgp and its transition to the ordinary confined hadronic matter , being part of the early cosmos evolution history , is of fundamental interest .",
    "such experiments are now carried out with a variety of collisional beam energies at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) as well as the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite . among many other observables , two-(and multi-)particle azimuthal correlations ( i.e. how particles emitted along one direction on the transverse plane get related with particles emitted along another direction ) play key roles .",
    "for example , practically all collective flow measurements are done through such correlations  @xcite .",
    "other examples include , e.g. hard - soft di - hadron correlations which , via contrast between da and aa , were instrumental in establishing the jet quenching phenomenon  @xcite .    in the past several years",
    ", there have been significant interests in measuring and understanding the charge - dependent azimuthal correlations , that is , to study the azimuthal correlations separately for same - sign pairs ( with + + or  charges ) and for opposite - sign pairs ( with one + and the other - ) and to see their differences .",
    "a major motivation came from proposals in search of possible anomalous effects , such as the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite , chiral separation effect ( cse )  @xcite , chiral magnetic wave ( cmw )  @xcite , chiral electric separation effect ( cese )  @xcite , etc .",
    "such effects arise from nontrivial interplay between chiral fermions and qcd topological objects that are abundant in hot qgp  @xcite , and can be manifested as generation of vector and/or axial currents in response to external strong ( electro)magnetic ( em ) fields .",
    "the heavy ions ( such as au , u , or pb nuclei ) with large positive electric charges and moving at nearly speed of light , naturally provide the extremely strong em fields ( on the order of hadronic scales @xmath0 ) at the early moments in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "a lot of works have been done in the past few years to hunt for these effects , especially the cme , by measuring the charge - dependent azimuthal correlations and analyzing their implications  @xcite .",
    "the precise interpretations of data and the contributions of various related background effects are still under intensive investigations  @xcite , as recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the cme motivated measurements , for which the following charge - charge azimuthal correlations were proposed  @xcite and measured both at rhic  @xcite and at lhc  @xcite , @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the azimuthal angles of two final state charged hadrons .",
    "the average @xmath5 means first averaging over all pairs @xmath6 that consist of one @xmath7 charged and one @xmath8 charged hadrons and then averaging over all the events .",
    "such azimuthal correlations are reaction - plane dependent and essentially measure the in - plane / out - of - plane difference of same - sign(ss ) or opposite - sign(os ) pair correlations .",
    "the cme predicts a vector current and a resulting final hadron charge separation along the external magnetic field direction which is approximately out - of - plane .",
    "therefore if cme is the only source contributing to these correlations , one expects the same - charge correlation ( @xmath9 ) to be negative and the opposite - charge correlation ( @xmath10 ) to be positive , with the two having the same magnitude .",
    "the star data for @xmath9 and @xmath10 indeed shows the signs and centrality trends in accord with cme expectation .",
    "however in the complex environment of heavy ion collisions , there are other sources that could also contribute to these measured correlations .",
    "as first analyzed in  @xcite , the existence of those `` background effects '' is best shown by another type of ( reaction - plane independent ) azimuthal correlations which were also measured : @xmath11 while the cme - induced same - charge pair correlation ( in co - moving pattern ) would contribute positively to the above observable , the data show strongly negative @xmath12 which means the dominant same - sign pair correlation would be in back - to - back pattern .",
    "these measurements together strongly suggest that there are non - cme  background \" contributions , some of which have been identified recently , including e.g. the transverse momentum conservation ( tmc ) and the local charge conservation ( lcc ) . in peripheral collision , the transverse momentum conservation ( tmc )  @xcite tends to give both same - charge and opposite - charge correlations a negative shift which is proportional to the elliptic fow @xmath13 and inversely proportional to multiplicity .",
    "the local charge conservation ( lcc )  @xcite is another source : if the charges are forced to be neutralized over small domains in the fireball at freeze - out , then the collective flow will translate such spatial correlation into final ( co - moving ) moment correlation for opposite - charge pairs .",
    "furthermore the elliptic flow will induce an in - plane / out - of - plane difference , thus giving a positive contribution to @xmath10 ( while no contribution to @xmath9 ) .",
    "this lcc - induced contribution originates from considering the fluid cells as canonical rather than grand - canonical ensemble of charges and such effect is also approximately inversely proportional to multiplicity .",
    "in addition to the known ( and potentially unknown ) background effects , the cme - induced signals may also suffer from the strong initial state fluctuations of the matter geometry as well as the @xmath14-field orientation .",
    "the event - by - event fluctuations generally make the @xmath14 direction unaligned with the event - wise second - harmonic participant plane and hence tend to suppress the cme contributions to the @xmath15 , as thoroughly studied in  @xcite . for rhic auau collisions",
    "it was found  @xcite that such suppression is extremely strong for very central and very peripheral collisions and the most promising centrality bins for detection of any @xmath14-field induced effect is around @xmath16 .",
    "clearly the present situation concerning the interpretations of the measured charge - dependent azimuthal correlations calls for a careful separation of the flow - driven background contributions .",
    "note that both tmc and lcc effects contributions to @xmath15 grows with the elliptic flow ( i.e. increasing from central to peripheral collisions ) , however the @xmath14 field strength also shows a similar centrality trend , thus making the separation rather difficult .",
    "there have been a few different proposals in attempt to achieve this  @xcite , one of which is to utilize the uu collisions  @xcite . the uranium nucleus @xmath17u , unlike the au or pb , has a highly deformed prolate shape with a large quadrupole .",
    "the initial idea is that for the very central uu collisions there will be negligible magnetic field but still sizable geometric anisotropy ( e.g. due to the so - called `` body - body '' collision configuration ) that leads to elliptic flow , so that any @xmath14-related effect will be absent while any @xmath13-driven effect will still be present .",
    "very recently , star collaboration reported their preliminary results of the charge - dependent azimuthal correlations in uu collisions at @xmath18 gev  @xcite .",
    "the uu data show certain interesting features different from auau , and in particular for the most central events ( @xmath19 ) they observe a sizable @xmath13 but vanishing @xmath20 .",
    "the meanings of these uu data , in connection with the auau data , require a careful examination of how various known sources of such correlations evolve from the auau system to the uu system .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present study .",
    "our strategy will be to quantify the evolutions in the matter geometry ( that drives flow ) as well as in the em fields from auau to uu , and then based on plausible assumptions to extrapolation different effects ( @xmath13-related and @xmath14-related ) accordingly from auau to uu , and see if the correlations for both systems could be consistently understood as a combination of different effects .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ emfield ] we will report the event - by - event calculation of the strength of the em fields in uu collisions and the azimuthal correlations between @xmath14-field orientation and the event - wise participant plane . in sec .",
    "[ exper ] we will then use these results to extrapolate the decomposed ( @xmath13-related and @xmath14-related ) components of the correlations @xmath15 from auau data to uu collisions and compare them with uu data . finally we summarize in sec .",
    "[ discu ] . the natural unit @xmath21 will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the possibility to study heavy ion collisions using uu system has been discussed for long , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "event - by - event simulations were also previously done to study the expectations for multiplicities as well as the geometric anisotropies in the initial conditions for uu collisions .",
    "however the strong electromagnetic fields , crucial for those field - induced effects in uu collisions , have not been quantified before . in this section ,",
    "we report our event - by - event determination of such em fields and also importantly their azimuthal orientations with respect to the ( concurrently fluctuating ) initial matter geometry .",
    "we first discuss our setup for the event - by - event analysis of the electromagnetic fields generated in uu collision at @xmath18 gev , following similar simulations done for auau collisions in  @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the fields at the initial time , @xmath22 , that is , the time when the centers of the two colliding uranium nuclei both lie on the transverse plane .",
    "the time dependence of these fields will have no difference from that in auau case as previously studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) . throughout this section",
    "we will show results for the field point at the center of fireball @xmath23 .",
    "em fields at other transverse points have also been computed and compared with the auau case as in  @xcite , and they all show the same trends . we utilize the following form of the linard - wiechert potentials for constantly moving charges : @xmath24^{3/2}}{\\bf r}_n , { \\nonumber\\\\}\\\\ \\label{lwb } e{{\\bf b}}(t,{{\\mathbf r}})&=&\\frac{e^2}{4{\\pi}}\\sum_n z_n({\\bf r}_n)\\frac{1-v_n^2}{[r_n^2-({\\bf r}_n\\times{{\\bf v}}_n)^2]^{3/2}}{\\bf v}_n\\times{\\bf r}_n,{\\nonumber\\\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the relative position of the field point @xmath26 to the @xmath27th proton at time @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the velocity of the @xmath27th proton .",

    "in this section we conduct an extrapolation study from auau to uu systems . with the event - by - event simulations done for uu above and for auau previously in @xcite , we know how the matter geometry ( i.e. eccentricity @xmath91 driving elliptic flow ) changes from auau to uu , and we know how the @xmath14 field and its orientation ( which drives effect like cme ) changes from auau to uu .",
    "so with reasonable assumptions one may develop extrapolations on how the contributions to charge - dependent correlations from the two types of sources , the @xmath13-related and the @xmath14-related , would evolve from auau to uu systems . in what follows , we will first try to decompose the two types of sources in the auau data , and then extrapolate them respectively to uu , and see if a reasonable description of uu data would be achieved by such a combination of different effects .",
    "let us focus on the cme - motivated azimuthal correlation ( which itself is parity - even , able to measure the fluctuations of a parity - odd charge dipole ) @xmath92 it is also important to simultaneously examine the other charge - dependent azimuthal correlation @xmath11 to simplify the notation , we will also use @xmath9 ( ss for same sign ) and @xmath10 ( os for opposite sign ) to denote @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( similarly for @xmath95 below ) , respectively .",
    "the cme - induced correlations , as well understood before ( see e.g. discussions in  @xcite ) , would make the following contributions to these correlations : @xmath96 with @xmath97 .            as already discussed in the introduction , there are other - than - cme  background \" contributions to both @xmath98 and @xmath99 , including the transverse momentum conservation ( tmc ) or the local charge conservation ( lcc )",
    ". the dynamical mechanisms of both effects are intrinsically reaction - plane independent , with tmc inducing a charge - independent back - to - back correlation while the lcc inducing a near - side ( co - moving ) correlation solely in the same sign pair correlation .",
    "they however make a flow - dependent contribution to the reaction - plane dependent correlation @xmath98 due to the anisotropy in the particle azimuthal distribution as quantified by @xmath13 .",
    "as briefly analyzed in  @xcite , the contributions of these effects to the @xmath99 and the @xmath98 are related by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "one can therefore make the following plausible decomposition of the two types , cme - like and @xmath13-related , contributions to these correlations in the following two - component way : @xmath100 where @xmath101 are the @xmath13-related background contributions and @xmath102 are the cme contributions . with such working assumptions",
    ", we can then use the star auau collision data for @xmath103  @xcite , and @xmath13 to extract @xmath101 and @xmath102 as functions of centrality or multiplicity .",
    "the result of such a decomposition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fh ] . in the decomposition , we have used @xmath104  @xcite ; using other measurements of @xmath13 , like @xmath105 , @xmath106 gives minor difference in @xmath107 and @xmath108 below .",
    "from the plots one can see that : 1 ) the flow - related parts , @xmath109 ( including their centrality trends ) can be reasonably understood as a combination of tmc and lcc , with tmc making the negative contributions to both the @xmath110 and @xmath111 while the lcc making a strong positive contribution to the opposite sign correlations accounting for the difference between @xmath110 and @xmath111 ; 2 ) the remaining correlations ( that are unrelated to @xmath13 ) in the @xmath112 still show charge - dependence and the @xmath113 appears in line with the cme expectation ; 3 ) the @xmath114 for most centrality is positive ( which is different from cme expectation ) , and a plausible explanation of @xmath115 together could be that a charge - independent effect ( such as the matter dipole fluctuations pointed out in @xcite ) contributes to both while the cme accounts for the difference between @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "lastly , it is worth emphasizing that a single component assumption with only flow - related contributions would _ not _ work for describing all the data and a cme - like component appears necessary for a full description of full data set .",
    "a useful way to eliminate any charge - independent contributions and focus on the truly charge - dependent correlations is to make a subtraction between ss and os signals , @xmath116 in @xmath117 and @xmath118 , charge independent sources are then subtracted out .",

    "it might appear tempting to simply resort to an explanation that one of the two sources would be gone somehow in uu system .",
    "we however feel that might be somewhat naive , especially provided that the two components are clearly both needed for auau data and that after all there should be no drastic difference between auau and uu collisions after differences in factors like geometry , @xmath14 field and multiplicity have all been explicitly accounted for .    finally in fig .",

    "so what can one learn from the mismatch between the extrapolated results and the data for uu system ?",
    "logically there could be varied reasons : 1 ) it could be due to the assumption that the functions @xmath108 and @xmath123 in fig.[fh ] could be simply extrapolated from auau to uu ; 2 ) it could be that the way of linearly combining the two types of identified sources may not be fully accurate ; 3 ) it could also be that the two - component scenario may not be entirely true and there could be other unknown type of sources contributing to the correlations .",

    "we have attempted to understand how these correlations induced by various proposed effects evolve from collisions with auau system to that with uu system .    to do that",
    ", we have first systematically studied the electromagnetic fields generated in the rhic uu collisions at @xmath139 , incorporating initial state fluctuations on events - by - event basis .",
    "the fluctuations of the proton position in nucleus cause the fluctuations in the electromagnetic fields , which on one hand cause sizable electromagnetic field even for some very central events while on the other hand suppress the correlation between the @xmath14-field orientation and the matter geometry ( characterized by event - wise participant plane ) .",
    "we have quantified the `` projected field strength '' @xmath140{\\rangle}$ ] ( in fig .  [ fig_b2cos ] ) which control the @xmath14-field induced effects such as the cme .",
    "we have then used these results to study the recent charge - dependent azimuthal correlation measurements by star collaboration for uu collisions at @xmath141 .",
    "taking the experimental data for charge - dependent azimuthal correlations from auau collisions , we have developed a two - component decomposition ( see eq .",
    "( [ gab ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dab ] ) ) based on two types of identified sources ( @xmath13-related and cme like ) that could contribute to the measured correlations .",
    "we have further extrapolated each component to uu system with reasonable assumptions and compared the resulting correlations with data from uu collisions . and compare them with recent star measurements . based on such analysis",
    "we discuss the viability for explaining the data with a combination of the cme - induced and flow - induced contributions .",
    "the extrapolation results have demonstrated similar trend and order - of - magnitude agreement with data while still bearing quantitative discrepancy . from these studies",
    "it may be concluded that the suggested two - component scenario with @xmath13-related and cme - like contributions may be a viable explanation of the measured charge - dependent azimuthal correlations , but also calls for more careful modelings and more detailed experimental information .",
    "we end with a brief discussion on the evolution of these correlations @xmath98 and @xmath99 with collisional beam energies in light of the two - component scenario . in general",
    "one would expect variations of the functions @xmath108 and @xmath107 with beam energy , and that is why an extrapolation analysis to other beam energies becomes difficult .",
    "for example , going to low energy collisions ( as done in rhic beam energy scan ) , the physics could change drastically with the `` turning - off '' of a dominant piece of qgp in the fireball evolution . at low enough energy",
    "one may expect the disappearance of cme ( when the medium is no longer chirally restored ) as well as the disappearance of the lcc ( when the charge - carriers are not mobile enough to ensure local charge neutrality )  in that case the @xmath117 would approach zero as indeed seen in data  @xcite .",
    "going to the higher energy collisions as at lhc , one might expect a qualitatively similar pattern of the multiplicity - dependence of @xmath108 and @xmath107 as shown in fig.[fh ] , though possibly with overall magnitude shifting mildly .",
    "for the cme - like component , its energy dependence critically depends on the magnetic field : both its magnitude and its duration in time .",
    "while the magnitude scales approximately as @xmath142 ( with @xmath143 the proton mass ) and time duration scales in the inverse way as @xmath144 so the energy dependence of @xmath14 field may turn out to be rather mild . going from rhic to lhc energies , the integrated flow @xmath13 does not change much but the multiplicity at lhc ( for same centrality class ) does increase a lot ( by about a factor @xmath145 ) . noting that the function @xmath107 ( for cme - like source ) tends to be saturated for increasing multiplicity while the function @xmath108 ( for flow - related source ) tends to be suppressed toward increasing multiplicity , one would then expect that the @xmath117 at lhc would be quite close to that at rhic while the @xmath118 would be somewhat smaller at lhc than at rhic : both seem to be in line with the alice data  @xcite .",
