    "while in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) _ rosat _ ( @xcite ) and especially _ chandra _ ( @xcite ) has resolved almost all the xrb , in the hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) the xrb has been resolved at a 25%-30% level with _ bepposax _ and _ asca _ surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and recently at a 90% with _ chandra _ ( @xcite ) . moreover , in the very hard band ( 5 - 10 kev ) the fraction resolved by _ bepposax _ is around 30% ( @xcite ) and recently in the _ xmm - newton _ lockman hole deep pointing a 60% is reached ( @xcite ) . + the optical counterparts of the objects making the xrb are predominantly active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in the soft band",
    "the predominant fraction is made by unabsorbed agn , with a small fraction of absorbed agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of absorbed type-2 agn rises if we consider the spectroscopic identifications of hard x - ray sources in _ bepposax _ , _ asca _ and _ chandra _ surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . + the x - ray and optical observations are consistent with current xrb synthesis models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which explain the hard xrb spectrum with an appropriate mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed agn , by introducing the corresponding luminosity function and cosmological evolution .",
    "however , these models require the presence of a significant population of type-2 qsos ( @xcite ) , not yet detected in sufficient quantities .",
    "type-2 qsos are rare ( so far , only a few are known ) , luminous and hard ( heavily absorbed in the soft band ) .",
    "a good way of finding them is to perform surveys in the hard x - ray bands , covering large solid angles .",
    "the large throughput and effective area , particularly in the harder bands , make _ xmm - newton _ currently the best satellite to perform hard x - ray surveys .",
    "+ in this poster contribution we present results from the hellas2xmm survey ( @xcite ) , one of its main goals is to constrain the contribution of absorbed agn to the xrb .",
    "we use the xmm - sas analysis software tasks @xmath4 and @xmath5 to linearize the event files . before processing",
    ", datasets are corrected for the attitude of the satellite in order to have absolute positions in the sky .",
    "the attitude history file(ahf ) coordinates are given to the sas task @xmath6 which performs the correction .",
    "+ the event files produced by @xmath4 and @xmath5 are cleaned from :    * hot pixels ; with a procedure ( developed at ifc / cnr - milan by a. de luca ) which uses cosmic ray iraf tasks to localize the pixels to be rejected in each ccd and xmm - sas task @xmath7 for removing them from the event files ; * soft proton flares ; analysing the light curves at energies greater than 10kev and setting a threshold for good time intervals of 0.15 cts / s for mos units and of 0.35 cts / s for pn unit .    a complete set of mos1 , mos2 and pn 600x600 pixel images ( 1 pixel = 4.35 arcsec ) is generated using xmm - sas task @xmath7 in the 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 10 , 2 - 4.5 , 4.5 - 10 and 0.5 - 10 kev bands .",
    "mos and pn images are merged together in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the sources and go deeper .",
    "+ a corresponding set of exposure maps is generated to account for spatial quantum efficiency , mirror vignetting and field of view of each instrument , running xmm - sas task @xmath8 .",
    "the so - created exposure maps are not completely satisfactory , since the evaluation of quantum efficiency , filter transmission , and vignetting is performed assuming an event energy which corresponds to the mean of the energy boundaries . in the 2 - 10 kev band , this may lead to inaccuracies in the estimate of these key quantities , thus we create the 2 - 10 kev band exposure map as a weighted mean of the 2 - 4.5 kev and the 4.5 - 10 kev exposure maps ( assuming an underlying power - law spectral model with @xmath9 ) .",
    "+    xmm - sas task @xmath10 creates a background map by removing all the sources above a fixed maximum likelihood threshold and fitting the remaining with a cubic spline . even using the maximum number of spline nodes ( 20 ) ,",
    "the fit is not enough flexible to take into account the local variations of the background .",
    "we correct the background map produced by xmm - sas , pixel by pixel , comparing the mean value in it with that of the so - called cheesed image , within a radius of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = radius corresponding to an encircled energy fraction ( eef ) of 0.68 ) .",
    "a comparison between xmm - sas standard background map and our corrected map is shown in figure  [ abaldi - f_fig : bkgmap ] .",
    "a preliminary detection run , using xmm - sas @xmath13 , is performed in each energy band , in order to create a list of candidate sources .",
    "each source is characterized using a radius corresponding to an eef of @xmath14=0.68 .",
    "+ the source counts @xmath2 and their error @xmath15 are determined as @xmath16 @xmath17 the countrate is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sum of mos1 , mos2 and pn exposure times .",
    "the corresponding flux is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is calculated from the @xmath22 moreover we compute @xmath23 , the poissonian probability that counts originate from a background fluctuation , from the @xmath24 and choose a threshold of @xmath25 to decide whether to accept or not a detected source .",
    "the hellas2xmm survey ( @xcite ) currently uses the 15 _ xmm - newton _ calibration and performance verification phase fields shown in table  [ abaldi - f_tab:15fields ] .",
    "all the fields are at high galactic latitude ( @xmath26 @xmath27 27@xmath28 ) , have low galactic @xmath29 ( a few @xmath30 @xmath31 ) and at least 15 ksec of good observing time .",

    "+ at each image pixel @xmath49 we evaluate , within a radius @xmath12 , the total background counts ( from the background map ) . from these",
    "we calculate the minimum total counts ( source + background ) necessary for a source to be detected at a probability @xmath25 ( defined in section  [ abaldi - f_sec : srcdet ] ) . the mean exposure times for _ mos1 _ , _ mos2 _ and _ pn _ , evaluated from the exposure maps within @xmath12 ,",
    "are used to compute the count rate @xmath50 . from the count rate - to - flux conversion factor @xmath21 ( computed as in section  [ abaldi - f_sec : srcdet ] ) we build a flux limit map and straightforwardly calculate the sky coverage of a single field .",
    "+ summing the contribution from all fields we obtain the total sky coverage of the survey , which is plotted in figure  [ abaldi - f_fig : skycov ] , in three different energy bands . +",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath1 - @xmath0 @xmath2 distributions are plotted in figure  [ abaldi - f_fig : lognlogs ] and contain 1022 , 495 and 100 sources , for the 0.5 - 2 kev , 2 - 10 kev and 5 - 10 kev band , respectively .",
    "+    in the 0.5 - 2 kev band the distribution shows a flattening around @xmath3 erg @xmath31 s@xmath51 , similarly to _ rosat",
    "_ data ( @xcite ) although with a flatter differential slope index at faint fluxes .",
    "we are also in good agreement with _",
    "chandra _ deep field south data ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the 2 - 10 kev band we find that the distribution is significantly sub - euclidean , in contrast to _ bepposax _ and _ asca _ findings ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , indicating that the @xmath0 @xmath1 - @xmath0 @xmath2 flattens at fainter fluxes .",
    "anyhow it represents a link between _ chandra _",
    "( @xcite ) and _ bepposax - asca _ observation , sampling an intermediate flux range .",
    "the 5 - 10 kev @xmath0 @xmath1 - @xmath0 @xmath2 is consistent with an euclidean slope and samples an intermediate flux range between _ xmm - newton _ deeper observations ( @xcite ) and _ bepposax _ shallower hellas survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we divided the sample of sources detected both in 0.5 - 2 kev band and in 2 - 4.5 kev band in two subsamples containing the brighter ( @xmath52 erg @xmath31 s@xmath51 ) and the fainter ( @xmath53 erg @xmath31 s@xmath51 ) sources , respectively and we compute for them the hardness ratio : @xmath54    lcc + & n(@xmath55)&n(@xmath56 ) +   + faint sample&654&84 + bright sample&107&0 +   +    as shown in figure  [ abaldi - f_fig : hr1 ] and in table  [ abaldi - f_tab : hr1distrib ] , the faint sample shows a tail of hard sources which is not present in the bright sample .",
    "the probability of having 84 sources with @xmath56 in the faint sample and no sources with @xmath56 in the bright sample is @xmath57 , so the progressive hardening of the sources towards fainter fluxes seems to be highly significant .",
    "+    a further analysis of the hardness ratio has been carried out on the 4.5 - 10 kev sample . in figure  [ abaldi - f_fig : hr2 ]",
    "the relation between the 2 - 10 kev flux and the hardness ratio @xmath58 for sources detected in the 4.5 - 10 kev band is plotted .",
    "the diagram shows a progressive hardening of the sources when going towards fainter fluxes .",
    "while the lack of sources in the bottom left of the figure is due to a selection effect ( because we are more sensitive in the 2 - 4.5 kev than in the 4.5 - 10 kev band ) , there is no apparent reason for having no hard sources at fluxes greater than a few @xmath59 erg @xmath31 s@xmath51 .",
    "+ the population of harder sources we detect , probably consists of agn having substantial absorbing column densities ( @xmath60 @xmath31 ) .",
    "we are carrying out a serendipitous _ xmm - newton _ survey .",
    "we currently cover nearly three square degrees in 15 fields observed during satellite calibration and performance verification phase .",
    "this is , to date , the _ xmm - newton _ survey with the largest solid angle . + the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the @xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath0 @xmath2 relations in the 0.5 - 2 kev , 2 - 10 kev and 5 - 10 kev band are in agreement with previous determinations ; * in the hard bands we sample an intermediate flux range : deeper than _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ and shallower than _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ deep surveys * we find an evidence for hard sources emerging below 0.5 - 2 kev fluxes of @xmath61 erg @xmath31 s@xmath51 and 2 - 10 kev fluxes of 10@xmath62 erg @xmath31 s@xmath51 .",
