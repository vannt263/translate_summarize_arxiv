    "the primary objective of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to study the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking . within the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the higgs mechanism @xcite is invoked to explain this breaking and the higgs boson remains the only particle that has not been discovered so far .",
    "the direct search at the @xmath4 collider lep has led to a lower bound on its mass of 114.4 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", high precision electroweak data constrain the mass of the higgs boson via their sensitivity to loop corrections .",

    "exclusion of a higgs boson with @xmath7=170 gev @xcite . both atlas and",
    "cms experiments at the lhc , scheduled for proton - proton collision data taking in summer 2009 , have been designed to search for the higgs boson over a wide mass range @xcite . in these proceedings",
    "the sensitivity for each experiment to discover or exclude the sm higgs boson as well as recent developments that have enhanced this sensitivity are summarized .",
    "theoretical predictions for nlo sm higgs production cross - sections at 14 tev energy as a function of @xmath7 @xcite are shown in fig.[sigma ] ( left ) .",
    "the dominant production mechanism , which proceeds via a top - quark loop , is gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it gives rise to 2040 pb sm higgs cross section in the mass range between 114 and 185 gev .",
    "the vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) process ( @xmath9 ) has a factor of eight smaller cross section .",
    "however , in this case , the higgs boson is accompanied by two energetic jets going mainly into the forward directions .",
    "usually they have large pseudorapidity gap in - between .",
    "in addition , there is no colour flow between these _ tagging _ jets which allows for use of _ a central jet veto _ to reduce backgrounds .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 processes have smaller cross sections .",
    "the sm higgs boson is predicted to have many decay channels with branching ratios which strongly depend on its mass ( fig.[sigma ] ( right ) ) .",
    "the evaluation of the search sensitivity of the various channels should take into account the cross - sections of the relevant backgrounds . at low higgs mass",
    "the dominant decay mode is through @xmath13 .",
    "however , due to the enormous qcd backgrounds this channel is not good for the sm higgs discovery .",
    "the @xmath14 final state , which appears when the higgs decays via bottom , top and @xmath15-loops , has a small branching fraction .",
    "however , excellent diphoton invariant - mass resolution and @xmath16/jet separation can make this mode one of the best discovery channels .",
    "@xmath17 has a sizeable rate and should be visible with good purity via the vbf higgs production mode .",
    "if the higgs mass is larger , the @xmath2 final states are powerful as well as the mode @xmath1 . in the last case ,",
    "the resulting branching ratio is small but the signal is easy to trigger on and allows for full reconstruction of the higgs mass .",
    "both atlas and cms collaborations have performed extensive geant - based monte carlo @xcite studies with full simulation and reconstruction to determine the experimental viability of many higgs decay channels .",
    "results of the recent studies @xcite for the most attractive signatures , namely @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and vbf @xmath17 are summarized below .          despite a only 0.2% branching ratio in the higgs mass region 120140 gev",
    ", @xmath18 remains a promising channel as the signal signature is very clean .",
    "irreducible backgrounds come from continuum production of diphotons , @xmath21 .",
    "reducible backgrounds are mostly due to @xmath16-jet and jet - jet events , where one or more jets are misidentified as photons .",
    "studies performed by both the atlas and cms experiments consider the signal and backgrounds at nlo level .",
    "thanks to a very good electromagnetic energy resolution , with a simple cut - based analysis for an integrated luminosity of 30 @xmath6 one can obtain a significance above 5@xmath22 in the cms experiment for the mass range 115140 gev ( fig.[sign ] ( top left ) ) . having a worse energy resolution , atlas",
    "nevertheless can reach almost the same significance as the high - granularity electromagnetic calorimeter with longitudinal samplings is capable of determining the primary vertex with great precision .",
    "both experiments have looked beyond a simple cut - based analysis and enhanced the signal significance by 3050% ( fig.[sign ] ( top left ) ) .",
    "the `` golden '' channels ( 4@xmath23 , 2@xmath242@xmath23 and 4@xmath24 final states of @xmath25 decays ) are expected to be good for discovery in a wide mass range ( except @xmath5130 gev and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the dominant background is the @xmath25-continuum with smaller contributions from @xmath27 and @xmath28 processes . through the use of impact parameter and lepton isolation",
    "requirements the latter two ( which are important only at low @xmath7 ) can be significantly reduced .",
    "simulations of the signal and the @xmath29 backgrounds were made up to the nlo level .",
    "an additional 2030% contribution from the @xmath30 process was also taken into account .",
    "a 5@xmath22 discovery in @xmath19 mode is possible in much of the allowed @xmath7 space with less than 30 @xmath6 of integrated lhc luminosity ( fig.[sign ] ( top right ) ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the main search channel in the higgs mass range @xmath31 due to a very large @xmath32 branching ratio ( fig.[sigma ] ( left ) ) .",
    "this mode is also good at lower masses ( down to @xmath33 130 gev ) and at high @xmath7 .",
    "two different final states are considered : @xmath34 and @xmath35 . unlike the @xmath36 and @xmath18 channels ,",
    "full mass reconstruction is not possible therefore an accurate background estimate is critical .",
    "the dominant background for this analysis is @xmath37-production in the case of @xmath38 + 0 jets signal .",
    "this background can be suppressed by exploiting the spin correlation between the two final state leptons . for @xmath38 + 2 jets , where the contribution from @xmath39 process is the most important",
    ", @xmath28-production is the main background which can be reduced by the _",
    "forward jet tagging _ and _ central jet veto _ requirements .",
    "nlo - level studies ( with systematics included ) have shown that less than 2 @xmath6 integrated luminosity would be sufficient for a 5@xmath22 discovery of the sm higgs with @xmath40160170 gev .",
    "let us note that using the vbf @xmath41 mode alone , atlas is able to observe this particle with 10 @xmath6 of integrated luminosity provided 150 gev @xmath42 180 gev ( fig.[sign ] ( bottom left ) ) .      in gluon - fusion production mode",
    "the @xmath17 channel is not promising due to large backgrounds .",
    "however , one can consider the @xmath39 process which helps to reduce contributions coming mainly from the @xmath43 + jets and @xmath28 processes .",
    "data - driven methods for understanding the dominant backgrounds have been investigated .",
    "three final states of @xmath44 decays are considered : lepton - lepton , lepton - hadron and also hadron - hadron . despite the presence of neutrinos",
    ", mass reconstruction can be done via the collinear approximation where @xmath44 decay daughters are assumed to go in the same directions as their parents .",
    "the resolution on the reconstructed mass ( @xmath45 10 gev ) is mainly affected by the missing transverse energy resolution .",
    "simulations performed by atlas and cms have shown that the combination of the lepton - lepton and lepton - hadron channels should allow for a 5@xmath22 measurement with 30 @xmath6 lhc luminosity in the range 115 gev @xmath46 125 gev ( fig.[sign ] ( bottom right ) ) .",
    "figure [ cmsd1 ] ( left ) shows integrated luminosity needed for the 5@xmath22 discovery of the inclusive higgs boson production with the decay modes @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath47 in the cms experiment . in the most complicated region below @xmath40130 gev , less than 10 @xmath6 would be sufficient while in the range 155 gev@xmath42400 gev only 3 @xmath6 are required . the signal significance as a function of the higgs boson mass for 30 @xmath6 of integrated lhc luminosity for the different higgs boson production and decay channels",
