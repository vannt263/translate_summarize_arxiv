    "a nonlocal realistic model , the de broglie - bohm theory , is not only consistent with quantum theory but also coherently describes measurement processes including wave - function collapse @xcite .",
    "this raises a question if all realistic models must be nonlocal to be consistent with quantum theory , which led to the discovery of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "recently , the nonlocality involved with bell s inequality and entanglement has entered a new phase of its development .",
    "it turned out that entanglement is a concrete physical resource for information processing @xcite . in the same context ,",
    "interestingly , it was found that with nonlocal correlations we can generate a cryptographic key , a private random shared sequence , whose security relies on only the no - signaling principle @xcite . for this , no quantum theory is used for the security analysis . however , the only currently available way to realize nonlocal correlations is by using quantum entanglement .",
    "so these protocols are called no - signaling _ quantum _ key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "remarkably , what is used to show security in no - signaling qkd is only the outcomes of measurements . as long as the outcomes satisfy a certain condition , security is provided , no matter how the outcomes are generated .",
    "thus , no - signaling qkd has device - independent security . to satisfy the security condition",
    ", detector efficiency must be much higher than what is currently achievable .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the security of no - signaling qkd against individual attacks has been analyzed in a novel way , exploiting the intrinsic structure of no - signaling probabilities @xcite .",
    "in particular , by fixing the size of the input and output alphabets that are used to generate a secret key between the legitimate parties , a finite set of extremal points are distinguished .",
    "information about the no - signaling polytope structure leads to huge simplifications in the security analysis . in ref .",
    "@xcite , security against individual attacks was shown using the insight that no - signaling and non - local probabilities are generally monogamous .",
    "indeed , a monogamy relation that is valid for no - signaling probabilities is explicitly employed to show the security .",
    "this approach can be applied even if the eavesdropper s alphabet is not binary @xcite .    in this paper , we present a security analysis of no - signaling qkd protocols by numerically optimizing no - signaling probabilities .",
    "this explicitly shows that direct optimization over no - signaling probabilities can be used as the main theoretical tool to prove security .",
    "specifically , we consider the protocol proposed by acin , massar , pironio ( amp ) @xcite . to motivate the advantage of our approach",
    ", we note that the method in refs .",
    "@xcite relies on the specific structure of certain no - signaling polytopes shown in refs .",
    "however , it seems that the generalization to larger alphabets or higher dimensions is much harder to analyze ; see for instance ref .",
    "nevertheless , our result provides a straightforward enhancement to the analysis of no - signaling probabilities , and the formalism could potentially be applied to even more complicated scenarios .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we consider eve s ( an eavesdropper s ) guessing probability about bob s ( a receiver s ) bit .",
    "that is , we consider the case that eve s outcomes are binary . within the remaining space of joint probabilities ,",
    "we maximize @xmath0 , the probability that eve correctly guesses bob s bit , by linear programming .",
    "then , we derive a bound on the mutual information between bob and a general eve ( whose number of outcomes is now unrestricted ) , @xmath1 , by using the maximal @xmath0 . a key generation rate @xmath2 is obtained by using the csiszr - krner formula @xcite . in our case , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mutual information between alice ( a sender ) and bob .",
    "two users , alice and bob , attempt to distribute a bell state , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote alice and bob , respectively , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 compose an orthonormal basis of a quantum bit ( qubit ) . to mimic a realistic case with channel noise , we assume the bell state was transformed to a werner state @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "although we use the werner state to model potential data , our method does not rely on this .",
    "for each copy of the distributed state , alice chooses the value of an index @xmath12 among @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with probabilities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "then she performs a measurement @xmath17 on her qubit .",
    "@xmath18 is a measurement composed of the projections @xmath19 where @xmath20 . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are measurements composed of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath25 is a state obtained by rotating the state @xmath26 around the @xmath27-axis by an angle @xmath28 .",
    "bob also chooses a value of his index @xmath29 for each copy , either @xmath30 or @xmath31 , with probabilities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "then he performs a measurement @xmath34 on his qubit . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 is composed of @xmath37",
    ". next , both alice and bob publicly announce their values @xmath12 and @xmath29 for each copy .",
    "measurement outcomes in the case @xmath38 are kept and used to generate the key .",
    "outcomes from other cases are publicly announced to estimate eve s information .",
    "alice and bob choose @xmath15 and @xmath32 close to @xmath31 so that almost events are in the case @xmath38 .",
    "this does not affect the security in the asymptotic case we consider .",
    "we assume an individual attack in which eve follows the same procedure for each instance . for each choice of measurements @xmath12 and @xmath29 by alice and bob , there is a joint probability for measurement outcomes @xmath39 for alice , bob , and eve , respectively .",
    "the joint probability for @xmath39 , conditioned on measurements @xmath12 and @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath40 . here ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are binary variables according to the protocol .",
    "the number of eve s outcomes @xmath43 should be arbitrary in principle .",
    "however , for now we consider the case that eve s outcome is binary .",
    "we do this because we are interested in the guessing probability , and eve s final guess has to be binary to match bob s alphabet .",
    "let us write constraints for the joint probabilities .",
    "first , they satisfy normalization @xmath44 for each @xmath45 .",
    "let us denote the marginal distribution for alice and bob , @xmath46 , by @xmath47 .",
    "the marginal distributions corresponding to the state in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) should be consistent with the measurement outcomes . for the measurement basis choice",
    "@xmath48 we have @xmath49 for @xmath50 , where there is no correlation , @xmath51 for each @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 where the two numerical values , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , are obtained from measurement outcomes for the bell state . for @xmath58 , @xmath59 now we consider no - signaling conditions . because the marginal distribution for alice and eve must be independent of bob s basis choice , we have @xmath60 for each @xmath12 . here",
    "we use a notation for marginal distributions analogous to the previous one .",
    "similarly , @xmath61 for each @xmath29 .",
    "another no - signaling constraint is that eve s marginal distribution is independent of the basis choices of alice and bob , @xmath62 for each @xmath45 .      here we maximize the guessing probability , @xmath0 , for a binary - restricted eve within these constraints ( [ 2])-([9 ] ) by linear programming .    for visual convenience , @xmath40",
    "are denoted as : @xmath63 we regard @xmath64 as a binary number , for example , @xmath65 .",
    "now let us rewrite the constraints regarding measurement outcomes . for eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , we have , respectively , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 . for eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , we have @xmath70 we can see that eqs .",
    "( [ a2])-([a5 ] ) make the normalization in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) satisfied .",
    "thus the normalization condition is redundant and can be removed .    the no - signaling condition in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we can see that , by eqs .",
    "( [ a2])-([a5 ] ) , the case when @xmath74 implies the case when @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "thus the latter cases can be removed .",
    "the no - signaling condition in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "we can also see that , by eqs .",
    "( [ a2])-([a5 ] ) , the case when @xmath78 implies the case when @xmath79 , respectively . thus the latter cases are redundant and can be removed .",
    "we can verify that eqs .",
    "( a6 ) and ( a7 ) ( or equivalently , eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) ) lead to eq . ( [ 9 ] ) , which can thus be removed . as a result",
    ", we can remove all variables @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is an odd number .",
    "therefore , by non - negativity of each quantity , the space in which we optimize @xmath83 is as follows : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 where j=0,2,4,6 , and @xmath88 where @xmath69 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the constraints are those that remain in eqs .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) after removing odd numbered variables .    because the key is generated only from the results where @xmath38",
    ", we need to consider the joint distribution @xmath89 .",
    "now , the guessing probability @xmath90 where eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) are used .    to maximize the guessing probability , we use linear programming @xcite .",
    "first we note that the constraints ( [ a8])-([a10 ] ) define a convex set .",
    "we define @xmath91\\times[0,\\tfrac{1}{2}]$ ] as the projection of this set onto the @xmath92-plane where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we notice that @xmath95 is convex and is symmetric under transformations @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in our case",
    "the linear function @xmath98 can be directly optimized using linear programming .",
    "specifically , for fixed value of the noise parameter @xmath99 , we perform the following optimization : @xmath100      now we obtain a bound on the mutual information , @xmath1 , from the guessing probability @xmath0 . there is a simple relation for the problem @xcite : let us consider a marginal distribution for bob and eve , @xmath101 .",
    "here eve is not binary - restricted ( @xmath72 and @xmath102 ) .",
    "consider conditional probabilities @xmath103 and @xmath104 due to the joint probability @xmath101 .",
    "the joint probabilities can be written as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a marginal distribution for bob .",

    "let @xmath109 be eve s probability to guess bob s outcome correctly , when her outcome is @xmath110 .",
    "however , we can observe that @xmath111 .",
    "because @xmath112= h[p(1|j)]=h[p_e(j)]$ ] here , we have @xmath113 p(j ) , \\label{b2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ( average ) guessing probability is @xmath114 .",
    "however , for a fixed @xmath98 , the smallest value of the quantity @xmath115 p(j)$ ] is obtained when each @xmath109 take either @xmath116 or @xmath31 , by the concavity of the binary entropy as discussed in ref .",
    "let @xmath117 denote the sum of all @xmath106 such that @xmath118 .",
    "then we have @xmath119 and thus @xmath120 p(j ) \\geq r = 2(1-p_e ) .",

    "positive key is possible in the region where @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath4 ( dashed line ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    using the relation ( [ b5 ] ) and the maximal guessing probability obtained by linear programming , we can get a bound on @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . then , by the csiszr - krner formula @xcite , we can get a lower bound on the key generation rate @xmath123 .",
    "as we can see , in the regime @xmath124 where the werner state admits a local realistic model , eve has full information about bob , namely @xmath125 , so there can be no secret key .",
    "however , in the regime where @xmath126 , eve s information is restricted . when @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath4 is equal to 1 , giving maximal @xmath129 .",
    "the region where we have non - zero @xmath2 is @xmath130 .",
    "the key generation rate we obtained is the same as optimal rate found in eq .",
    "( 8) in ref . @xcite .",
    "we outlined a straightforward approach for obtaining a secret key rate using only no - signaling constraints and linear programming . assuming an individual attack",
    ", we considered all possible joint probabilities .",
    "we initially examined the case where eve has binary outcomes .",
    "we imposed constraints due to the no - signaling principle and given measurement outcomes . within the remaining space of joint probabilities , by using linear programming , we optimized the guessing probability between bob and eve .",
    "we then presented an inequality that relates the guessing probability to the mutual information between bob and a general eve who is not binary - restricted . using the bound and the csiszr - krner formula @xcite",
    ", we lower bounded the final key generation rate .",
    "the optimal value of the key generation rate , obtained in the noiseless case @xmath127 , exactly matches the result from ref .",
    ". however , our approach does not require any specific knowledge of the no - signaling polytopes , instead relying on linear programming techniques to optimize the relevant quantities .",
    "thus , our approach holds promise for application to other protocols , where the structure of the no - signaling polytopes can not be determined analytically .",
