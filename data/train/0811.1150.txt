    "for a long time there have been intensive studies of the chaotic advection of point particles in flows @xcite-@xcite .",
    "newer studies focus on particles of a finite size , instead of point particles without mass . based on the early work of basset @xcite and later boussinesq @xcite and oseen @xcite , equations of motion for spherical particles of a finite size in a flow at low reynolds numbers",
    "were introduced by maxey and riley @xcite ( maxey - riley equations ) .",
    "these equations have been studied in varying context . in many cases",
    "the finite - size effects lead to completely different results compared to what is observed for ideal tracers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular the results depend on the characteristics of the particles , i.e whether they are lighter or heavier than the fluid .",
    "one of the most important applications of these studies are problems where in addition to the dynamics of the particles in the flow active processes of the particles are included .",
    "such active processes concern the dynamics of the particles themselves , i.e. they can change their physical and chemical properties due to various kinds of interaction .",
    "examples are the study of biological processes ( growth of plankton populations ) , chemical processes ( chemical reactions in chaotic or turbulent flows ) , and physical processes ( aggregation and fragmentation of marine aggregates , e.g. sediment particles in the ocean , or cloud formation ) @xcite-@xcite . using the maxey - riley equations ,",
    "the influence of the finite size of particles on such active processes as autocatalytic reactions and coalescence of particles has recently been studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for particular parameters of the flow chaotic attractors can occur , leading to filamental structures of the particle distribution .    in this paper",
    "the maxey - riley equations are studied in the case of an infinite , cellular , time dependent flow field . due to the strokes",
    "drag the particle motion is dissipative , giving rise to the possibility of attractors in phase space .",
    "the observed system behavior is highly complex and depends strongly on the parameter values .",
    "different forms of periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic behavior appear in the system , with both single attractors and parameter regions possessing multi - stability . some particular attractors and parameter regions",
    "have already been discussed by e.g. maxey @xcite , yu et al .",
    "@xcite and nishikawa et al .",
    "others have not been studied yet .",
    "because of the complexity and the number of parameters that can be varied ( a total of 6 parameters ) only a part of the parameter space , namely the variation of two parameters , is studied in this paper .",
    "these two parameters are chosen for their relevance in the context of application in active , physical processes .",
    "in particular we are interested in the type of long - term behavior , which occurs for different sizes and mass of the particles .",
    "since active processes like aggregation and fragmentation change the size of the particles , it is interesting to study the impact of variations in the size on the dynamics of the particles .    for both particles , heavier and lighter than the fluid , quasiperiodic solutions in the form of a torus can be observed in a large parameter region . in this paper",
    "we are studying some of the changes that these tori undergo , as parameters are varied .",
    "the main focus is on pitchfork bifurcations of tori that appear in this context .    while there is a large body of work devoted to the study of bifurcations of fixed points and periodic orbits in various fields of science , there are only a few examples from application where bifurcations of tori occur .",
    "some general results are known from the mathematical literature concerning the bifurcations of tori @xcite and particularly the break - up of tori and the transition to chaos @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these theoretical findings are accompanied by numerical studies of paradigmatic systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "examples from physics are mainly focused on the possibility of the emergence of tori with three incommensurate frequencies @xmath0 @xcite-@xcite and the break - up of tori with two incommensurate frequencies @xmath1 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the more basic bifurcation of a torus studied here has to our knowledge not yet been observed in a physical system and is only known from a mathematical point of view ( e.g. sun @xcite ) . for particles moving in a fluid flow two kinds of pitchfork bifurcations of a torus can be obtained in different parameter intervals .",
    "first we find a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation , where an unstable torus becomes stable and gives rise to the emergence of two new unstable tori .",
    "second a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed , where a stable torus becomes unstable and two new stable tori are created . while the first bifurcation happens only if the particles are lighter than the fluid , the second one occurs for particles heavier than the fluid .",
    "in contrast to the usual transition from sub- to supercritical which appears on the same bifurcation line , we find no continuous connection between the two bifurcations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ equations ]",
    "the equations of motions are presented .",
    "based on the maxey - riley equations the complete equations of motion for small spherical particles in a time - dependent flow field are recalled and some basic properties of the system are described , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "section [ general ] gives a general overview of the system behavior depending on the size of the particles and of the part of the parameter space that is of relevance to the pitchfork bifurcation presented here .",

    "are chosen to allow a comparison with results by e.g. nishikawa et al . @xcite .",
    "the period of the forcing is therefore @xmath94 .",
    "the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath81 are varied . additionally @xmath48 and @xmath54 change accordingly when varying @xmath79 and @xmath81 .",
    "according to the aim of our study we are interested in the qualitative behavior of the nonlinear system described by eqs . - . depending on the system parameters we can distinguish different kinds of long - term dynamics , such as periodic orbits , quasiperiodic and chaotic motion .",

    "even though we do not take these processes explicitly into account and deal only with the dynamics of passive tracers we focus on the size of the particles as the most important bifurcation parameter .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the particles depends strongly on their size , i.e. different invariant sets are obtained for different sizes . additionally we obtain an interesting bifurcation that we study in more detail . before investigating this bifurcation we present the overall picture of qualitative behavior in some parts of the parameter space .",
    "+    since the system can not be solved analytically , numerical calculations are required to find the invariant sets corresponding to different long - term dynamics .",
    "attractors can be easily found by examining the long - term simulations of the particle dynamics .",
    "unstable invariant sets are harder to find due to their saddle type character .",
    "estimates are made by starting very close to the unstable invariant sets and then examining the short - term behavior . to get a starting point close to the unstable invariant set ,",
    "a refinement procedure has been applied to minimize the distance to the unstable invariant set .",
    "we follow the basic idea of the pim - triple method which has been developed to compute chaotic saddles @xcite .",
    "we start with a set of initial conditions along a line with fixed @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 but varying @xmath98 .",
    "since the unstable invariant set and its stable manifolds separate the basins of attraction of different stable invariant sets , we integrate all initial conditions until they reach one of the attractors . then we take the initial condition , say @xmath99 , which ( i ) lies between two initial conditions @xmath100 and @xmath101 converging to different attractors and ( ii ) possesses the maximum time needed to reach the attractor ( pim - proper interior maximum for the transient time ) .",
    "this point @xmath99 is then taken as a starting point for the unstable invariant set .",
    "if the transient time is not long enough , so that @xmath99 is not close enough to the invariant set , then the whole procedure is repeated with a line of initial conditions connecting @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "+    the qualitative behavior of the system is highly dependent on the parameter values . in total",
    "there are 6 parameters involved that can be varied . because of the number of different invariant sets that occur for variations of each of these parameters no attempt is made to give a complete description of all the invariant sets and bifurcations occurring in the whole parameter space .",
    "thus we focus on the variation of a few parameters and keep the others fixed .",
    "as already mentioned the size class parameter @xmath81 will be the main control parameter to be varied .",
    "in addition we study the behavior for particles with different mass ratios compared to the fluid , i.e. for different values of @xmath79 . according to eq .",
    "the variation of @xmath79 also implies a variation of the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath54 .    in fig .",

    "both bifurcation diagrams look rather complicated . for different size classes",
    "@xmath81 we observe different long - term dynamics , in particular periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic motion . varying the size classes we find various bifurcations , indicating transitions between different types of motion .",
    "looking only at the projections of the trajectories it is not possible to distinguish between quasiperiodic and chaotic motion .",
    "such a distinction requires the computation of the lyapunov exponents , which are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bif_lyapunov_r1 ] ( lower panel ) and [ fig : bif_lyapunov_r06 ] ( lower panel ) respectively . the computation of the lyapunov exponents is based on the algorithm developed by shimada and nagashima @xcite which allows for the computation of the whole spectrum of lyapunov exponents separately for each attractor occurring in the system .",
    "it is important to note that the figure showing the lyapunov exponents indicates for each parameter value always the largest occurring lyapunov exponents in the system , computed for a set of 30 different initial conditions .",
    "this means that even though the lyapunov exponents are shown as a smooth curve , they can correspond to different attractors .",
    "such a visualization has been chosen to emphasize always the most complex motion which can be found for a particular parameter value .    based on simulations and lyapunov exponents we can immediately identify period doubling , e.g. at @xmath102 and @xmath103 , transitions to chaos , e.g at @xmath104 and @xmath105 and torus bifurcations , e.g. at @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( compare fig [ fig : r06_bifurkation ] ( lower panel ) and fig . [ fig : r1_bifurkation ] ( lower panel ) ) .",
    "intermittency can be expected at e.g. @xmath108 .",
    "this is closely related to the emergence of periodic windows within the chaotic parameter ranges .    within the considered parameter range",
    "we find regions where only a single attractor occurs and regions with multistability where several attractors coexist for the given set of parameter values , as i.e. seen for @xmath109 $ ] for @xmath110 . in the latter regions it depends crucially on the initial conditions which of these stable states is realized .",
    "each of these coexisting attractors has its own basin of attraction . for many of the considered parameter ranges these basins have a complexly interwoven structure leading to a very high sensitivity of the final state to initial conditions ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig : basins_complex ] ) . in the following the basins of attraction shown",
    "are computed as two - dimensional cross - sections of the complete four - dimensional basins of attraction for initial conditions with @xmath111 \\times [ 0,2]$ ] and @xmath112 .",

    "we also note that bubbles and aerosols of the same size exhibit different behavior as well .    from all the occurring bifurcations we choose the torus pitchfork bifurcation for a detailed analysis , since to our knowledge",

    "@xmath81 values the long - term dynamics yields two periodic orbits of period @xmath61 .",
    "in addition the dynamics show the existence of an unstable torus ( see fig . [",

    "the basins of attraction are separated by the two unstable tori.,scaledwidth=47.0%,height=192 ]    at @xmath131 the unstable torus undergoes a bifurcation .",
    "the unstable torus becomes stable , with two new unstable tori branching off ( see fig . [",
    "fig : r1_beforeafter ] ( lower panel ) for @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation of a torus . in the bifurcation diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : r1_bifurkation ] this transition is manifested by the abrupt appearance of the quasiperiodic motion indicated by the black area beyond the critical parameter value .",
    "the change can also be seen in the lyapunov exponents , where the largest exponent @xmath132 now is equal to zero ( compare fig . [",
    "fig : bif_lyapunov_r1 ] ( lower panel ) ) .",
    "there are now three possible states for the long - term dynamics , with the actual result for a particle depending on the initial condition . once again , the unstable tori form the borders of the basins of attraction . in this case , the unstable tori separate the basins of attraction of the stable torus from the basins of attraction of the two periodic orbits ( fig . [ fig : r1_alpha051_einz ] ) . here , the basin boundary is again smooth .    for different values of @xmath81 , the system shows a number of other interesting types of behavior , but the analysis of these is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for further studies .",
    "some examples include a series of phase - lockings on the unstable torus and subsequent pitchfork bifurcations of the resulting periodic orbits in the interval @xmath133 $ ] , emergence of other stable periodic solutions ( @xmath134 ) and a break - up of the stable torus at @xmath135 ( see @xcite ) that gives rise to a chaotic attractor with fractal basin boundaries .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of passive finite - size particles in a fluid flow at low reynolds numbers .",
    "it was found that the dynamics of such particles can vary greatly with their size and also with their mass relative to the fluid . for different parameter regions , periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic motion was observed .",
    "when considering sets of particles belonging to different size classes and advected by the same flow , finite - size particles will settle on different attractors depending on their size .",
    "that means that in systems where aggregation and fragmentation processes take place the particles of different size will concentrate in different areas of the configuration space . in the case",
    "when the time span between the aggregation and fragmentation events is long compared to the time needed to approach the attractor , the particles will be distributed according to their respective attractors .",
    "but in most cases one has to expect that aggregation and fragmentation will happen more frequently , so that the transient dynamics will blur the separation of different size particles in different attractors .    for small size classes",
    "we find a parameter range where the dynamics is dominated by quasiperiodic attractors for particles lighter and heavier than the fluid .",
    "this quasiperiodic motion in form of a torus has been studied in more detail .",
    "the torus undergoes both a sub- and a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation , depending on the mass of the particles relative to the fluid . for particles lighter than the fluid",
    "the bifurcation is always subcritical , while for particles heavier than the fluid the bifurcation is supercritical .",
    "no continuous transition between these two bifurcations exists in this system , instead the transition between the different states happens via a neimark - sacker bifurcation where the two stable tori emerging in the supercritical pitchfork - bifurcation disappear .",
    "this neimark - sacker bifurcation forms a boundary at the line @xmath53 of neutrally buoyant particles , separating the different invariant sets observed for both kinds of pitchfork bifurcations .    at this line of neutrally buoyant particles the symmetry of the unstable torus",
    "is reversed ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : r06_beforeafter ] ( upper panel ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : r1_beforeafter ] ( upper panel ) ) .",
    "this change in the symmetry can be easily understood from a physical point of view .",
    "particles lighter than the fluid get suspended at the stable fixed points for long times , but for short times ( if they start close to the unstable torus ) move upwards through the flow .",
    "the torus therefore lies in the regions with local upflow .",
    "particles heavier than the fluid sink through the fluid , the torus lies in regions with local downflow . at the line @xmath53 particles neither rise nor sink through the flow , instead they collect in the region with only horizontal fluid velocity , i.e. here the tori become a horizontal line at the border of each unit cell ( @xmath136 ) .    for @xmath79 very close to @xmath137",
    "the line of supercritical pitchfork and the line of neimark - sacker bifurcations seem to touch tangentially in a bifurcation of higher codimension .",
    "but the appearance of higher codimension bifurcations is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "additionally , for low and high values of @xmath79 ( @xmath138 ) other bifurcations occur which are related to a phase - locking on the torus under consideration , giving rise to a complex network of bifurcation lines in parameter space .    as a result",
    ", a system of finite - size particles moving in a fluid flow , provides an example of a sub- and supercritical pitchfork bifurcation of a torus in a realistic physical system .",
