    "we observe that @xmath15 is power law distributed over about six decases , saturated by an exponential cut - off .",
    "this distribution has been interpreted before as the analogue of a gutenberg - richter law in voice , as the precise shape of energy release fluctuations during voice production parallel those occurring in earthquakes @xcite . as increasing @xmath3 induces a flow in rg space , systems which lie close to a critical point ( unstable fixed point in rg space )",

    "an alternative and perhaps more common formulation of this law @xcite is defined in terms of the rank , such that if words are ranked in decreasing order by their frequency of appearance then the number of occurrences of words with a given rank @xmath30 goes like @xmath31 , where it is easy to see that both exponents are related via @xmath32 and thus @xmath33 approximates to 1 @xcite . here for convenience we make use of the former and explore @xmath34 applied to the statistics of types .",
    "again @xmath34 could in principle depend on the threshold but assuming that the signal complies with the scale - invariance mentioned above , one can collapse all threshold - dependent curves into a universal shape and thus remove any dependence on this parameter by rescaling @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total number of different types present in the signal and @xmath37 as the total number of tokens ( see si for technical details ) .",

    "thus for each type we can compute its mean duration @xmath46 averaging over all voice events that fall within that type , and then plot the histogram @xmath49 that describes frequency of each type versus its mean duration .",
    "brevity law would require @xmath49 to be a monotonically decreasing function .",
    "these results are shown for a particular language in log - log scales in figure [ fig : figure_brevity ] , finding initially a power law decaying relation which is indicative of a brevity law ( results are again found to be language independent , see si for additional results ) .",
    "the inset provide the threshold - dependent distributions and the outset panel provides the collapsed , threshold - independent shape @xmath47 ( see table [ table : tablas_slopes ] for scaling exponents ) . again in this case results in null models deviate from such behavior ( si ) and are clearly different from the random typing @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can also directly observe the duration frequency at the level of voice events , finding similar results ( see si ) .",
    "in this work we have explored the equivalent of linguistic laws directly in acoustic signals .",
    "we have found that human voice -which actually complies to soc dynamics with critical exponents compatible with those found in rainfall @xcite- manifests the analog of classical linguistic laws found in written texts ( zipf s law , heaps law and the brevity law or law of abbreviation ) .",
    "these laws are found to be invariant under variation of the energy threshold @xmath3 , and can be collapsed under universal functions accordingly . as @xmath3 is the only free parameter of the method , this invariance determines that the results are not afflicted by ambiguities associated to arbitrarily defining unit boundaries .",
    "results appear to be robust across languages and timescales ( ranging six different indoeuropean languages and different scales extending all the way into the intraphoneme range , and invariant under energy threshold variation ) .",
    "interestingly , an equivalent analysis performed on null models defined by randomizing the signal @xmath13 ( yielding white noise with the same instantaneous energy distribution of the original signal ) fail to reproduce this phenomenology ( si ) .",
    "the concrete range of exponents found for both zipf and heaps laws are compatible between each other and somewhat similar -but not identical- to the typical ones observed in the literature for written texts @xcite , whereas to the best of our knowledge this is the first observation of scaling behavior with a clear exponent in the case of brevity law in speech .",
    "actually , our finding of a power law in brevity law differs from the case of random typing where a power law does nt conform @xcite .",
    "+ the specific and complex alternation of air stops ( silences ) intertwined with voice production are at the core of the microscopic voice fluctuations . during voice production , acoustic communication",
    "is governed by the so - called biphasic cycle ( breath and glottal cycle , see @xcite for a review ) that together with some other acoustic considerations ( pitch period , voice onset time , the relation between duration , stress and syllabic structure @xcite ) determines the microscopic structure of human voice , including silence stops . however , these timescales are in general very large : as previously stated , this current study focus and scans voice properties even at intraphonemic timescales , where the statistical laws of language emerge directly from the physical magnitudes that govern acoustic communication .",
    "our results therefore open the possibility of speculating whether the fact that these laws have been found in upper levels of human communication might be a result of a scaling process and a byproduct of the physics rather than derived from the choice of the typical units of study on the analysis of written corpus ( phonemes , syllabus , words , ... ) , like differences between analysis of indoeuropean and logosyllabic languages demonstrates @xcite . as a matter of fact , in a previous work human voice",
    "has been framed within self - organized criticality ( soc ) , speculating that the fractal structure of lungs drives human voice close to a critical state @xcite , this mechanism being ultimately responsible for the microscopic self - similar fluctuations of the signal .",
    "this constitutes a new example of the emergence of soc in a physiological system , different in principle from the classical one found in neuronal activity @xcite .",
    "one could thus speculate that the emergence of these complex patterns is just a consequence of the presence of soc , what in turn would support the physical origin of linguistic laws . from an evolutionary viewpoint , under this latter perspective human voice , understood as a communication system which has been optimized under evolutionary pressures , would constitute an example where complexity ( described in terms of robust linguistic laws ) emerges when a system is driven close to criticality , something reminiscent of the celebrated edge of chaos hypothesis @xcite .",
    "+ more generally , the method used and proposed here also addresses the longstansing problem of signal segmentation .",
    "it has been acknowledged that there is no such thing as a correct segmentation strategy @xcite . in",
    "written corpus white space is usually taken as an easy marker of the separation between words , however this is far from evident in continuous speech where separation between words or concepts is technologically harder to detect , conceptually vague and probably ill - defined .",
    "few exceptions that used oral corpus for animal communication still require to define ad hoc segmentation algorithms @xcite , or manual segmentation strategies which usually give an arbitrary or overestimated segmenting times @xcite , what might even raise epistemological questions .",
    "as such , this segmentation problem unfortunately has prevented wider , comparative studies in areas such as animal communication or the search for signs of possible extraterrestrial intelligence from radio signals ( in this line only few proposals have been made @xcite ) . by varying the energy threshold the method presented here automatically partitions and symbolizes the signal at various energy scales , providing a recipe to establish an automatic , general and systematic way of segmenting and thus enabling comparison of across acoustic signals of arbitrary origion for which we may lack the syntax , code or exact size of its constituents .",
    "+ to round off , we hope that this work paves the way for new research avenues in comparative studies .",
    "open questions that deserve further work abound ; just to name a few : in the light of this new method , what can we say about the acoustic structure in other animal communication systems ?",
    "can we find evidence of universal traits in communication that do not depend on a particular species but are only physically and physiologically constrained , or on the other hand are linguistic universals a myth @xcite ?",
    "how these laws evolve with aging @xcite ? are they affected by cognitive or pulmonary diseases ? what is the precise relation between soc and linguistic laws in this context ? and",
    "in particular , can we find mathematical evidence of a minimal , analytically tractable soc model that produce these patterns ? these and other questions are interesting avenues for future work .",

    "<S> linguistic laws constitute one of the quantitative cornerstones of modern cognitive sciences and have been routinely investigated in written corpora , or in the _ equivalent _ transcription of oral corpora . </S>",
    "<S> this means that inferences of statistical patterns of language in acoustics are biased by the arbitrary , language - dependent segmentation of the signal , and virtually precludes the possibility of making comparative studies between human voice and other animal communication systems . </S>",
    "<S> here we bridge this gap by proposing a method that allows to measure such patterns in acoustic signals of arbitrary origin , without needs to have access to the language corpus underneath . </S>",
    "<S> the method has been applied to six different human languages , recovering successfully some well - known laws of human communication at timescales even below the phoneme and finding yet another link between complexity and criticality in a biological system . </S>",
    "<S> these methods further pave the way for new comparative studies in animal communication or the analysis of signals of unknown code .    </S>",
    "<S> the main objective of quantitative linguistics is to explore the emergence of statistical patterns ( often called linguistic laws ) in language and general communication systems ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most celebrated of such regularities is zipf s law describing the uneven abundance of word frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this law presents many variations in human language @xcite but also shows ubiquity @xcite in many linguistic scales @xcite , has been claimed to be universal @xcite and has consequences for syntax and symbolic reference @xcite . on the other hand heaps law , also called herdan s law @xcite states that the vocabulary of a text grows allometrically with the text length @xcite , and is mathematically connected with zipf s law @xcite , the scaling exponent being dependent on both zipf law and the vocabulary size . </S>",
    "<S> finally the zipf s law of abbreviation ( or brevity law for short ) is the statistical tendency of more frequent elements in communication systems to be shorter or smaller @xcite and has been recently claimed as an universal trend derived from fundamental principles of information processing @xcite . as such , this statistical regularity holds also phonetically @xcite and implies that the higher the frequency of a word , the the shorter its length or duration , probably caused by a principle of compression @xcite , although this is a general pattern that can change depending on other acoustical factors like noise @xcite , pressure to communicate at long distances calls @xcite or communicative efficiency @xcite and energetic constraints @xcite . + linguistic laws extend beyond written language and have been shown to hold for different biological data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to some authors @xcite , the presence of scaling laws in communication is indicative of the existence of processes taking place across different cognitive scales . interpreting linguistic laws as scaling </S>",
    "<S> laws which emerged in communication systems @xcite actually opens the door for speculating on the existence of underlying scale - invariant physical laws operating underneath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , in order to explore the presence or absence of such patterns one needs to directly study the acoustic corpus , i.e. human voice , as every linguistic phenomenon or candidate for language law can be camouflaged or diluted after the transcription process . notwithstanding </S>",
    "<S> the deep relevance of linguistic laws reported in written texts , we still wonder up to which of these laws found in written corpora are related or derive from more fundamental properties of the acoustics of language -and are thus candidates for full - fledged linguistic laws- , or emerge as an artifact of scripture codification . </S>",
    "<S> + * linguistic laws in acoustics ? * acoustic communication is fully determined by three physical magnitudes extracted from the signals : frequency , energy and time @xcite . the configuration space induced by these magnitudes results from an intrinsic evolutionary relationship between the production and perception of sound systems @xcite that further shapes the range of hearing and producing sounds for a variety of life forms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since animals use their acoustic abilities both to monitor their environment and to communicate we should expect that natural selection has in some sense optimized these sensorial capabilities , but , despite the great differences that evolution has involved for different animals that communicate acoustically , there are many similarities between their mechanisms of sound production and hearing @xcite . focusing on primates , </S>",
    "<S> traditionally language has been distinguished from vocalizations of nonhuman primates only at a qualitative , semantic level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it is well known that children use statistical cues to segment the input @xcite and probably share with non - human primates some of these mechanisms , albeit with some differences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of these statistical learning abilities has boosted a new approach to the study of language @xcite and suggests that statistical learning of language could be based on patterns or more generally linguistic laws @xcite : research on language acquisition shows that higher frequency facilitates learning , and zipf s law tell us that vocabulary learning is easier than expected a priori given the skewness of the distribution , for instance . </S>",
    "<S> we advance that , as will be shown below , these patterns are already present in the physical sound waves produced by human voice even at levels below those generally considered linguistically significant , i.e. , below the phoneme timescale . +        empirical evidence of robust linguistic laws holding in written texts across different human languages has been reported many times ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and it has been shown that these laws are not fully observed in random texts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies with oral corpus are however much less abundant , and they systematically imply a transcription of the acoustical waves into words in the case of human speech or some ill - defined analog of words in the case of animal communication , as the main segments to analyze @xcite . a few current efforts take a different road and consider other possible written units such as lemmas @xcite or compare written and oral production for some linguistic patterns @xcite , in general showing that frequencies of elements in written corpora can be taken as a rough estimate for their frequency in spoken language @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all in all , the exploration of linguistic laws in oral corpora is scarce . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , all linguistic studies in oral and written corpora are influenced by our segmentation decisions and our definition of word , intimately biased by an inherently anthropocentric perspective and , of course , by our linguistic tradition . </S>",
    "<S> the idea that speech is produced like writing , as a linear sequence of vowels and consonants may indeed be a relic of our scripture technology . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , it is well - known in linguistics that both vowels and consonants are produced linearly but also depend on their surrounding elements : this is the traditional and well - studied concept of coarticulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries between acoustical elements are therefore difficult to identify if we are not native speakers of a language , and that s yet a crucial problem of phonotactics and speech segmentation and recognition @xcite with differences across languages @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> precisely because of this , classical signal segmentation based on the concept of `` word '' inherited from writing has lead some researchers to search how to transform artificially written corpora into phoneme or syllabic chains with different objectives @xcite , at the time it involves two major problems in communication studies , namely ( i ) the impossibility of performing fully objective comparative studies between human and non - human signals @xcite , where signals could be physical events , behaviours or structures to which receivers respond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this problem leads researchers sometimes to manually segment acoustic signals guided only by their expertise , and prevents to explore signals of unknown origin including for instance the search for possible extraterrestrial intelligence @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) a rather arbitrary definition of the units of study guided by ortographic conventions already produces non - negligible epistemological problems at the core of linguistics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this work we explore the acoustic analog of classical linguistic laws in the statistics of speech waveform from extensive real databases @xcite that for the first time extend all the way into the intraphoneme range ( @xmath0s ) @xcite . in order to do so in a systematic way , in what follows we will present a methodology that enables the direct linguistic analysis of any acoustical waveform without needs to invoke to _ ad hoc _ codes or assume any concrete formal communication system underneath ( materials and methods , see figure [ fig : figure1 ] for an illustration ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method only makes use of physical magnitudes of the signal such as energy or time duration which therefore allow for a nonambiguous definition of our units . </S>",
    "<S> speech is indeed a physical phenomenon and as such in this work we interpret it as a concatenation of events of energy release , and propose a mathematically well - defined way for segmenting this orchestrated suite of energy release avalanches @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we find clear evidence of robust zipf , heaps and brevity laws emerging in this context and speculate that this might be due to the fact that human voice seems to be operating close to criticality , hence finding an example of a biological system that , driven by evolution , has linked complexity and criticality . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this methodology can open a fresh line of research in communication systems where a direct exploration of underlying statistical patterns in acoustic signals is possible without needs to predetermine any of the aforementioned non - physical concepts , and hope that this will allow researchers to develop comparative studies between human language and other acoustical communication systems or even to unravel whether </S>",
    "<S> if a generic signal shares these patterns @xcite . + * data . * for this work we have used a tv broadcast speech database named kalaka-2 @xcite . originally designed for language recognition evaluation purposes , it consists of wide - band tv broadcast speech recordings ( 4h per language sampled using 2 bytes at a rate of 16khz ) ranging six different languages : basque , catalan , galician , spanish , portuguese and english and encompassing both planned and spontaneous speech throughout diverse environmental conditions , such as studio or outside journalist reports but excluding telephonic channels . + * the method . * </S>",
    "<S> the objects under study , speech waveforms or otherwise any generic acoustic signal , are fully described by an amplitude time series @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : figure1 ] for an illustration of the method ) . in order to unambiguously extract a sequence of symbols </S>",
    "<S> -the equivalent to words and phrases- from such signal without the need to perform _ ad hoc _ segmentation , we start by considering the semi - definite positive magnitude @xmath2 which , dropping irrelevant constants , has physical units of energy per time ( si for additional details on speech waveform statistics ) . by defining an energy threshold @xmath3 in this signal @xcite we will unambiguously separate voice events ( above threshold ) from silence events ( below threshold ) . more concretely , @xmath3 is defined as a relative percentage and its actual value in energy units depends on the signal variability range : for example @xmath4 means that @xmath5 of the data falls under this energy level . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that @xmath3 decimates the signal similarly to a real - space renormalization group ( rg ) transformation @xcite , in such a way that increasing @xmath3 induces a flow in rg space . </S>",
    "<S> systems operating close to a critical state lie in an unstable fixed point of this rg flow and its associated signal statistics are therefore shown to be threshold - invariant . </S>",
    "<S> now , @xmath3 not only works as an energy threshold that filters out background or environmental noise ( noise filtering being a key aspect that species have learned to perform @xcite ) but , as previously stated , enable us to unambiguously define what we call a _ token _ or voice event , that is , a sequence of consecutive measurements @xmath6 , from a silence event of duration @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> each token is in turn characterized by a duple @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the duration of the event and @xmath10 corresponds to the total energy released during that event @xmath11 obtained summing up the instantaneous energy over the duration of the event . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the signal is effectively transformed to an ordered sequence of tokens @xmath12 , each of these being separated by silence events of highly heterogeneous durations @xmath7 which , incidentally , are known to be power law distributed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by logarithmically binning the scale of integrated energies we can assign an energy label ( the bin ) to each token , hence mapping the initial acoustic signal into a symbolic sequence of fundamental units which we call _ types_. the logarithmic binning is justified here invoking fechner - weber s law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that two tokens whose integrated energy fall in the same energy range are mapped to the same type even if their duration can be different , so in principle several tokens could map into the same type ( see si for a table of type / token ratios ) . by default we define as many bins as voice events </S>",
    "<S> such that the set of bins can be understood as an abstraction of a universal language vocabulary , accordingly some bins might be empty and in general each bin will occur with uneven frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> as such , types can be understood as acoustically - based universal abstractions of a fundamental unit , an abstract version of words or phonemes that appear intertwined in a signal with characteristic patterns . </S>",
    "<S> + to summarize , with this methodology we are able to map an arbitrary acoustic signal into a sequence of types separated by silence events ( figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> standard linguistic laws can then be directly explored in acoustic signals without needs to have an _ a priori _ knowledge neither of the signal code nor of the adequate segmentation process or the particular syntax of the language underlying the signal . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol is thus independent of the communication system and can be used to make unbiased comparisons across different systems and signals . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , results could in principle depend on the particular value of @xmath3 , as this scans the signals at different energy thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> however human voice has been recently shown to be invariant under changes in @xmath3 -an evidence of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite in this system- and , accordingly , parameter - free laws can be extracted using a proper collapse theory as it will be shown in the results section . finally , in order to guarantee that the emergence of linguistic laws is only due to the structure and correlations of the signal and not due to the process of symbolization we will compare the results obtained from speech signals to properly defined null models which randomize the signal @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these null models thus maintain the marginal instantaneous energy distribution and remove any other correlation structure , yielding non - gaussian white noise with a fat - tailed marginal distribution . </S>"
