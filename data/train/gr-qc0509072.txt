    "the issue of stability with respect to quantum fluctuations in the path integral approach to quantum gravity is a fundamental problem as important as quantum gravity itself . due to the attractive nature of the gravitational field",
    ", we expect to find a lot of unstable physical configurations",
    ". therefore one might worry about the stability of the ground state of quantum gravity .",
    "one generally accepts to regard minkowski space as the ground state , or vacuum , of quantum gravity .",
    "classical small perturbations about this vacuum are stable .",
    "this is guaranteed by positivity theorems of schoen and yau@xciteand witten@xcite .",
    "however one might find that flat space is quantum mechanically unstable .",
    "this problem was investigated for the first time by gross , perry and yaffe ( gpy)@xcite in the euclidean path integral context .",
    "they discovered that hot flat space is unstable and the loss of stability was interpreted as a spontaneous nucleation of a black hole with an inverse temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the black hole mass and @xmath2 is the newton constant . in the semiclassical approximation to the euclidean path integral@xmath3 \\right )   , \\label{p01}%\\ ] ] the decay probability per unit volume and time @xmath4 is defined as@xmath5   \\right )   \\int\\mathcal{d}h_{\\mu\\nu}\\exp\\left (   -i_{g}^{\\left ( 2\\right )   } \\left [   h_{\\mu\\nu}\\right ]   \\right )   , \\label{p02}%\\ ] ] where the gravitational field @xmath6 has been separated into a background field @xmath7 and a quantum fluctuation @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath10 is the prefactor coming from the saddle point evaluation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the classical part of the action .",
    "if a single negative eigenvalue appears in the prefactor @xmath10 , it means that the related bounce shifts the energy of the false ground state@xcite . in the schwarzschild case",
    "gpy discovered one single negative mode @xmath13 .",
    "allen reconsidered the effect of finite boundaries on the appearance of a negative mode showing that , if the box enclosing the black hole is little enough the instability disappears@xcite . since the pioneering paper of gross , perry and yaffe",
    ", many other spacetime configurations have been investigated in different contexts .",
    "in particular , the de sitter case involving a positive cosmological constant has been examined in the inflationary context by bousso and hawking@xcite . in the same context of the de sitter background , ginsparg and perry@xcite , young@xcite and more recently volkov and wipf@xcite",
    "have computed the partition function to one loop . on the other hand , the anti - de sitter case involving a negative cosmological",
    "constant has been discussed by hawking and page@xcite and subsequently by prestidge@xcite . the parallel problem in a higher dimensional context of the gpy - instability",
    "was firstly taken under examination by witten@xcite , who examined the stability of kaluza - klein theories .",
    "after a decade gregory and laflamme reconsidered the problem of the gravitational stability in the context of branes@xcite .",
    "this opened an interest in string theory where the stability of black branes was widely examined by different authors@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the only case of instability involving not a nucleation of a single black hole but a pair , is the de sitter case .",
    "moreover a deep difference appears between this case and the anti - de sitter or schwarzschild case : temperatures before and after pair creation are different , at least in the neutral de sitter black hole pair creation . motivated by this result , we would like to reconsider the stability of flat space without involving temperatures as in the gpy analysis , but looking at a neutral black hole pair creation mediated by a wormhole of the schwarzschild type . recall that in the gpy instability is not possible to reach a vanishing temperature , because @xmath14 . therefore to investigate the stability at zero temperature , we need to consider a schwinger - like process of black hole pair creation .",

    "nevertheless , it is well known that a vanishing action with a euclidean metric describes flat space@xcite . therefore , in this very particular case we have found an alternative way to flat space at the price of having a topology change .",

    "negative modes arise from the analysis of geometric fluctuations about classical euclidean solutions of the einstein field equations .",
