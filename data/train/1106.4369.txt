    "this operator is directly related to the s - matrix of the field theory .",
    "the transformation is from a field that is a function of coordinates , one of which is a `` time '' that is used to order both the `` time '' ordered products used to define the s - matrix and the related path integrals , to a transformed field that is a function of the renormalization scale or cutoff .",

    "in fact , it is found that the action of a physical system ( to leading order in @xmath1 ) can be written as the classical action ( with quantum fluctuation corrections ) as a function of the renormalization scale and a transfer matrix ( scale dependent mass of the excitations ) as a function of the initial and final renormalization scales .",
    "these functions specify the solutions to the renormalization group equations for the coupling constant . in general , there are an infinite number of solutions , but it can be reduced to just two if the transfer matrix is a simple transfer function of the quotient of the initial and final renormalization scales .",

    "we have explored the meaning of mallat s scattering operator in the context of a physical system .",
    "the first major constraint that physics puts on the scattering operator is the composition property that demands that @xmath139 .",
    "this allows the scattering operator to be written as a functional derivative of a generating function that is of the form @xmath16 = n \\int [ d\\psi ( \\lambda ) ] \\ ; e^{(i/\\hbar ) s_0[\\psi ( \\lambda ) ] + ( i/\\hbar ) \\int dx j(\\lambda ) \\psi ( \\lambda)}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 $ ] is the action functional .",
    "this is a nontrivial constraint on the scattering operator . since the action is normally given as @xmath56 $ ] , the important calculation is determining @xmath140 $ ] given @xmath56 $ ]",
    "this was shown to be a successive averaging of the physics ( the generalized force and the change in the generalized momentum ) over scale . to leading order , including the quantum fluctuation term , the generating function can be written as a functional of @xmath141 and @xmath105 which are the expected values of the first and second order scattering operators .",
    "the physics is encoded in these functions .",
    "the correspondence is completed by the identification of the distribution of functions , @xmath47 , as the state of the physical system ; the function , @xmath46 , as the field ; the @xmath61 cutoff of the wavelet transform as the @xmath58 convergence factor of the path integral ; and , most importantly , the expected value of the scattering operator as the s - matrix .",
    "what @xmath55 $ ] really expresses is how the physics changes as a function of the scale in inverse distance , @xmath106 .",
    "the simultaneous change of basis from @xmath22 and @xmath23 puts one in the natural basis for calculation of the s - matrix and therefore does not have any singularities to renormalize .",
    "the practical significance of this transformation is the compact representation of the physics in the @xmath141 and @xmath105 functions .",
    "this compactness is further enhanced by the relatively few parameters of the physical theory that become functions of scale , and the low order terms that tend to appear in practical @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "there are two major classes of application of this perspective on renormalization .",
    "the first is , given an action @xmath56 $ ] , calculating the s - matrix .",
    "this has great potential to get renormalized solutions of quantum gravity and to allow calculation of qcd in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the second is , in the analysis of the state of the system , to understand the underlying physics .",
    "it is even more practical than this .",
    "given textures ( that is , states ) that have come from self organization of complex physical systems , it can be determined which of those textures were generated by the same system , that is physics . as mallat has discussed the @xmath141 and @xmath105 give a natural metric on the space of complex systems . in other words ,",
    "if given three textures , it can be determined which two are most alike .",
    "a related application is the extrapolation of scale behavior .",
    "if it is known that textures belong to just a few possible classes , those textures could be identified from a very small part of the s - matrix , then the texture could be extrapolated in scale by using the known full s - matrix for that class .    returning back to the quote from ken wilson , he was quite right to have had the instinct to have looked for such a basis .",
    "what he did not have at his finger tips was this scattering operator which combines the best attributes of the fourier and wavelet transforms , and eliminates the unwanted attributes of both .",
    "( this would be a lack of stationarity of the wavelet transform and a lack of lipschitz continuity to deformation of the fourier transform manifested as the uv divergence , that is singularity , in the conventional field theory calculation of the s - matrix . )",
    "the scattering transform accomplishes this by an iteration of the wavelet transform .",
    "this is the innovation of this perspective on renormalization .",
