    "<S> the gaussian component in this voigt profile could potentially be caused by spectral diffusion owing to pulsed - laser - induced charge fluctuations in the vicinity of the qd ( trapping and untrapping of charges in nearby defects and impurities ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneous linewidth varies for different qds and typically shows an increase at larger excitation power ( see fig.@xmath3s3 ) , which is in qualitative agreement with previous investigations of light - induced spectral diffusion @xcite .      to perform pulsed two - photon interference </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt a similar experimental configuration ( see fig.@xmath33a ) as in ref.@xmath3@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each excitation laser pulse , originally separated by @xmath1112.5ns , is further split into two pulses with a 2-ns delay . </S>",
    "<S> thus , every @xmath1112.5ns , the qd is excited twice , generating two successive single rf photons . </S>",
    "<S> the output rf photons are then fed into an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer with a 2-ns path - length difference ( fig.@xmath33a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two outputs of this interferometer are detected by single - mode fiber - coupled single - photon counters , and a record of coincidence events is kept to build up a time - delayed histogram ( for more details see fig.@xmath3s4 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the hom dip @xcite which can not explained by classical optics . </S>",
    "<S> figure@xmath33c shows a strong suppression of the coincidence counts at zero delay when the two incoming photons are prepared in the same polarization state . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative evaluation ( see the caption of fig.@xmath33 for details ) shows that the probability of the two photons to exit the same channel in a 2-photon fock state ( bunching ) is 95.4@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a raw two - photon hom interference visibility of 0.91(2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the residual two - photon emission probability @xmath2 , and the optical imperfections of our interferometric setup which are independently measured , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the reflectivity and transmitivity of the beam splitter and @xmath16 is the first - order interference visibility of the mach - zehnder interferometer tested with a cw laser , we obtain corrected degrees of indistinguishability to be 0.97(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility can be further increased slightly by decreasing the excitation laser power . on another qd </S>",
    "<S> , we test the hom interference with @xmath0 , 0.72@xmath0 and 0.41@xmath0 pulse excitation and observe visibilities of 0.96(6 ) , 0.97(6 ) and 0.99(4 ) , respectively ( see the data in fig.@xmath3s4 ) .    taken together , these are to date the highest visibilities reported for qd - based single - photon sources . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that the solid - state pulsed rf single photons in quick succession are highly indistinguishable to a level comparable to the best results from those well - developed systems such as parametric down - conversion @xcite , trapped atoms and ions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the pure dephasing time t@xmath9=5.7@xmath17ns is considerably larger than the 2ns and thus should have little effect on the visibility . the spectral diffusion ( as shown in fig.@xmath32c ) </S>",
    "<S> should also happen at a time scale much longer than the 2-ns separation , which is consistent with previous experiments @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate how the on - demand rf single photons can be utilized to implement a quantum controlled - not ( cnot ) gate . </S>",

    "<S> the photonic cnot gate is a basic building block for quantum computing and has been demonstrated many times with down - converted photons @xcite , and very recently , with </S>",
    "<S> _ p_-shell excited single photons from qds @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we prepare two input qubits encoded in the polarization states of the pulsed rf single photons @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24(@xmath25 ) denotes horizontal@xmath3(vertical ) polarization and is used to encode @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the two inputs are then fed into the optical circuit for the cnot operation as shown in fig.@xmath34a . </S>",
    "<S> the key element in this optical network is a partial polarizing beam splitter ( _ p_-pbs ) which has a transmission of 1(1/3 ) and a reflectivity of 0(2/3 ) for the @xmath24(@xmath25 ) photons . </S>",
    "<S> when the two single photons are superimposed on the _ p_-pbs as shown in fig.@xmath34a , and if one and only one photon leaves through each output channel , the composite state of the two output photons can be written as : @xmath27 the first term corresponds to the case in which both input photons are @xmath28 and fully transmitted . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third terms correspond to the cases where one photon is in @xmath28 and fully transmitted while the other photon is in @xmath29 and partially ( 1/3 ) transmitted . </S>",
    "<S> it is most important to note the last term @xmath30 , where the resulting minus sign of the probability amplitude ( @xmath311/3 ) is due to the quantum interference between two indistinguishable paths , both photons are transmitted ( @xmath32 ) or reflected ( @xmath33 ) , which requires the indistinguishability of the single photons .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we swap the @xmath24 and @xmath25 polarizations in eqn.[[1 ] ] using half - wave plates and pass the two photons through two other _ p_-pbss to compensate the unbalanced coefficient ( see fig.@xmath34a ) , and we can obtain @xmath34 this effectively realizes a controlled phase - flip gate with a success probability of 1/9 . finally , after applying two additional hadamard rotations , it can be transformed into the cnot gate ( see the caption of fig.@xmath34a and ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for more details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally evaluate the performance of the quantum cnot gate using an efficient method proposed by hofmann @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to show the quantum behaviour of the cnot gate , it is tested for different combinations of input - output states using complementary bases , that is , in both the computational basis ( @xmath35 ) and their linear superpositions ( @xmath36 ) , which are refereed to as the @xmath37 and @xmath38 basis using the pauli matrix language respectively . in the @xmath37 basis , the cnot is expected to flip the target qubit if the control qubit is in logic 1 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in the @xmath38 basis , the target and control qubits are reversed : the control qubit will flip if the target qubit is logic 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement results of the input - output probabilities of the cnot gate in the @xmath37 basis and in the @xmath38 basis are shown in fig.@xmath34b and fig.@xmath34c respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of the cnot operation , defined as the probability of obtaining the correct output averaged over all four possible inputs , is in the @xmath37 basis : @xmath39 , and in the @xmath38 basis : @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these two complementary fidelities , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are sufficient to give an upper and a lower bound for the full quantum process fidelity @xmath43 of the gate by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , here we have @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the process fidelity is directly related to the quantum entangling capability of the cnot gate , that is , the cnot gate can produce entangled states from unentangled input states @xcite . here , the @xmath43 well surpasses the the threshold of 0.5 , which is sufficient to confirm the entangling capability of our cnot gate .      in this work , </S>",

    "<S> such a pulsed rf single - photon source may open the way to new interesting experiments in quantum optics and quantum information . with the high degree of indistinguishability of the rf photons shown here </S>",
    "<S> , they can be used to realize various optical quantum computing algorithms @xcite , interference of multiple photons @xcite , and the on - demand generation of photonic cluster state from a single qd @xcite . in parallel , </S>",
    "<S> the rf spectra of a two - level system under strong pulsed laser excitation which are expected to exhibit novel features beyond the mollow triplet @xcite is in itself a subject worth studying .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural extension is to realize non - postselective high - visibility quantum interference between two pulsed rf single photons from separate qds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on this , it is possible to entangle remote , independent qd spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that although the relatively slow spectral diffusion and pure dephasing does not affect the two - photon interference in our present work due to the 2-ns time separation of the photons , it will limit the degree of indistinguishability for photons from independent qds . for future experiments , </S>",
    "<S> gate - controlled qds could be used to reduce the spectral diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , spectral filtering at the expense of photon rate may be needed .    for quantum information applications , </S>",
    "<S> the photon extraction efficiency is a critical issue . </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have obtained @xmath0-pulse excited single photons with an overall collection efficiency of 1.3% reaching the single - photon detector . </S>",
    "<S> the photon extraction efficiency can be improved , for example , by embedding the qds in micropillars or photonic crystal cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> large purcell effects from these microcavities can be helpful to efficiently funnel the spontaneous emission into a guided mode , to further mitigate the dephasings @xcite , and increase the pulse repetition rate to tens of ghz . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , it is important to note that in the previous pulsed above - bandgap or _ </S>",
    "<S> p_-shell excitation experiment , the photon coherence time had to be much larger than the incoherent carrier relaxation time jitter ( about tens of ps ) in order to obtain a good two - photon interference visibility @xcite , which fundamentally put a limit on the radiative lifetime shortening through the purcell effect . </S>",
