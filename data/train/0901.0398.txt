    "electronic scattering at the interface between a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor has been used as a probe to investigate the electronic properties of superconductors@xcite and , more recently , feas superconductors(fas ) , leading , in the latter case , to different conclusions regarding the pairing symmetry@xcite . as compared to conventional and high - t@xmath0 materials , the recently discovered feas",
    "based superconductors have a more complex band structure , with a fermi surface ( fs ) consisting of four sheets , two of them hole - like , and the other two electron - like@xcite .",
    "s - wave , d - wave and p - wave pairing scenarios have been proposed to describe the superconducting state@xcite .",
    "one of the suggested pairing scenarios is the so - called sign - reversed s - wave state ( s@xmath1-state ) , where the gap function has opposite signs in the hole - like and the electron - like sheets of the fs .",
    "since this is a novel possibility , it deserves some theoretical development .",
    "a recent experiment seems to confirm this pairing scenario in a 122 compound@xcite .",
    "blonder _ et al_@xcite devised a theory for andreev scattering in isotropic s - wave superconductors which has been later generalized to unconventional ( anisotropic ) superconductors @xcite .",
    "these theories apply to one band superconductors . in the case of multiband superconductors ( mbs ) , such as fas and heavy - fermion compounds , the bands are usually treated as separate conduction channels with ( classically ) additive conductances@xcite , like paralel resistors , thereby neglecting the quantum mechanical nature of the scattering problem at the interface , where interference effects between the transmitted waves in different bands of the mbs are expected .",
    "such interference effects will lead to new features in the conductance .",
    "we are thus posed the problem of finding the wave function for the scattering state of an incident particle from a one - band metal which is transmitted through two or more bands inside the superconductor .",
    "the splitting of the incident electron s probability amplitude among several conduction channels is the same quantum mechanical problem as in a quantum waveguide .",
    "thus , in order to derive the appropriate matching conditions for the wave function at the interface , we need to make an extension of quantum waveguide theory .    applying to the case of fas",
    ", we obtain the differential conductance curves _ vs _ bias voltage and explicitly show the emergence of andreev bound states ( abs ) in the s@xmath1-state scenario , as a manifestation of interference effects between the bands , unlike the usual abs in one - band superconductors .",
    "an unusual feature of the abs is that they occur at a finite energy above the fermi level and disperse with the electron s transverse momentum . on the other hand , interference effects",
    "may also suppress the conductance at certain energies .",

    "the wavefunction for a particle must be continuous and single - valued at the circuit node @xmath2 , implying that @xmath3 where @xmath4 are coordinates along branches 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "the ( probability and charge ) current conservation at the node is guaranteed by the `` quantum kirchhoff '' law@xcite @xmath5 where the coordinates @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) must be all of them directed to ( or away from ) the node @xmath2 and @xmath8 denotes the particle s effective mass in branch @xmath9 .",
    "a simple one - dimensional version of the n / mbs interface is a tight - binding chain which has a bifurcation at some point , as shown in figure [ tightexample ] .",

    "then , the incoming particle in branch 3 with wavevector @xmath16 is described by the wavefunction @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the reflection amplitude .    if chains 1 and 2 were decoupled , a bloch state in chain @xmath9 would have momentum @xmath19 and energy @xmath20 . but now suppose that an operator @xmath10 hybridizes bloch states in the two chains . the hamiltonian matrix for the coupled chains 1 + 2 , @xmath21 , has an off - diagonal element , @xmath22 , and its eigenstates follow from the eigenproblem : @xmath23 which yields two bands , @xmath24 , so that a bloch state in the coupled chains 1 + 2 has the form @xmath25 the eigenvector components , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , denote the wavefunction projections on branches 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the wavefunction for the transmitted particle in chains 1 + 2 reads , for @xmath28 , @xmath29 where the momenta satisfy the energy conservation condition @xmath30 .",
