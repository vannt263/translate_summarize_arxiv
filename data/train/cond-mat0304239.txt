    "non - equilibrium phase transitions occurring in systems amenable to be described by langevin equations including a multiplicative noise ( mn ) term are the subject of current intense studies .",
    "this embraces a broad variety of systems both in physics and in other disciplines .",
    "a phenomenology much richer and complex than that appearing in equilibrium systems , including counterintuitive behaviors , has been reported to appear in these , typically non - equilibrium , situations .",
    "see @xcite for detailed introductions to this growing field , including many different realizations .",
    "the interest in mn problems is enlarged even further , because of the existing mappings between them and other prototypical non - equilibrium problems @xcite .",
    "a well known instance is the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation , describing the kinetic roughening transition of generic interfaces under non - equilibrium conditions @xcite , which can be mapped onto a mn langevin equation , by performing the so called cole - hopf transformation linking the interface height at each point with the activity field of the mn equation .",
    "if an interface under consideration is described by the kpz equation and it is physically limited by a wall , _ i.e. _ if the heights can not be larger of smaller than a certain value , then this problem , _ bounded kpz _ , can be mapped into a multiplicative noise equation by employing the abovementioned transformation @xcite .",
    "the bounded kpz equation may experience , as parameters are varied , a phase transition from a depinned phase in which the interface escapes with probability one from the wall , to a pinned phase characterized by a finite expectation value of the stationary averaged height ( measured from the wall ) . in the mn language ( _ i.e. _ after employing the cole - hopf transformation ) the pinning - depinning transition corresponds to a critical point separating an _ absorbing phase _ in which the order parameter goes exponentially to zero ( depinned phase ) to an _ active phase _ in which the order parameter takes a non - vanishing average value .",
    "surprisingly enough , it was shown a few years ago that the introduction of `` upper '' or `` lower '' walls into a given kpz equation ( with a fixed non - linearity sign ) lead to quite different phenomenologies .",
    "the origin of this can be tracked down to the fact that the kpz equation is not invariant upon inverting the height ( see @xcite or @xcite for a more detailed explanation ) . taking , for instance , the sign of the coefficient of the kpz non - linearity to be positive , the introduction of an upper wall leads to a ( well established by now ) set of critical exponents characterizing the , so called , multiplicative noise 1 ( mn1 ) universality class @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a wall limiting negative values of the interface height ( lower wall ) leads to a different type of phase transition as shown by t. hwa and one of us some years back @xcite . in what follows , and following the nomenclature introduced in @xcite",
    ", we will use the term mn2 to name this class .",
    "it can be easily shown that a kpz equation with positive non - linearity and a lower wall is completely equivalent to a kpz with a negative non - linearity coefficient and an upper wall @xcite : one just have to change the sign of the height variable in the kpz - like equation to verify this .",
    "the mn2 class is of great importance in the context of alignment of dna and other biological sequences .",
    "it has been argued by hwa and collaborators , that the phase transition appearing upon changing the , so called , scoring parameter in the commonly used alignment algorithm can be mapped into the mn2 critical point @xcite .",
    "it is also related to some instances of non - equilibrium wetting @xcite .",
    "for some other applications and physical instances within this class see @xcite and references therein .",
    "while the mn1 class has been extensively studied , specially after its connections with non - equilibrium wetting @xcite and with the problem of synchronization in extended systems were established @xcite , the mn2 class remains poorly studied .",
    "furthermore , recent numerical analysis have revealed that the preliminary critical exponent values reported in @xcite might be far from their true asymptotic values .    aimed at clarifying these issues it is the purpose of this paper to analyze the mn2 phase transition in one dimensional systems using : i ) mean - field and field - theoretical techniques and ii ) numerical ( monte carlo ) analysis of different models claimed to belong to this class .",
    "finally let us stress that if the wall becomes attractive , rather than simply bounding , new phenomenology might appear .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the context of synchronization @xcite .",
    "this possibility will also be discussed along the paper .",
    "let us consider a kpz equation with a positive non - linearity coefficient , @xmath0 , in the presence of a lower wall , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a height variable , @xmath3 represents a constant drift while @xmath4 is a bounding wall .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 controls the wall penetrability , the limit @xmath6 corresponding to a perfectly rigid ( impenetrable ) wall .",
    "it has been shown previously that for both the mn1 and the mn2 classes the magnitude of @xmath7 does not influence the asymptotic properties at criticality @xcite ( its sign , however , is important , as it determines whether the wall is a lower or an upper one ) .",
    "the same property applies to equilibrium systems ( _ i.e. _ , for @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is a stochastic white noise with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes an average over the distribution of the noise .    for a fixed value of @xmath13 the interface experiences a pinning - depinning transition at some value @xmath14 .    some remarks concerning the connection of the previous equation with wetting problems follow . when @xmath15 is viewed as the distance separating a liquid - gas interface from a solid wall , eq",
    "( [ bkpz ] ) can then be interpreted as a dynamic model for nonequilibrium wetting . under this perspective @xmath3",
    "is the chemical potential difference between the liquid and the gas phases , @xmath16 is the thickness of the wetting layer , and the wall is a rigid , physical substrate . at",
    "_ bulk phase coexistence _ , _",
    "i.e. _ for the value of @xmath14 for which in the absence of the wall the interface does not move on average , @xmath16 diverges at all temperatures above certain wetting temperature , @xmath17 , while for @xmath18 the thickness of the liquid film can be big , but finite ( pinned interface ) .",
    "the temperature here is controlled by the parameter @xmath13 , which vanishes linearly with the mean - field wetting temperature as @xmath19 .",
    "thus , on approaching coexistence for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 at the mean - field level ) , @xmath16 diverges as @xmath22 .",
    "this transition , termed _",
    "complete wetting _ , is always continuous and the value of the @xmath23 exponent depends on the nature of the forces between the particles in the fluid phases and the wall . in this paper only short - range , exponentially decaying interactions between all the particles and the substrate ( as described by eq .",
    "( [ bkpz ] ) ) are considered .",
    "the change of variables @xmath24 transforms eq .",
    "( [ bkpz ] ) into the mn2 langevin equation : @xmath25 where for the sake of simplicity we have set @xmath26 and ito calculus @xcite has been used ( different coefficients for the laplacian and the kpz non - linear term could be reabsorbed using @xmath27 with a proper choice of @xmath28 ) .",
    "this transformation maps the depinning from the wall @xmath29 to a transition into an absorbing state @xmath30 .",
    "the physical equivalence between the cases @xmath31 with a lower - wall ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath32 with an upper wall ( @xmath33 ) , reflects in the fact that the same equation is obtained using @xmath24 and @xmath34 , respectively .    observe that eq.([mnminus ] ) is identical to the mn equation describing the mn1 class @xcite , except for the presence of an extra term @xmath35 .",
    "this term can also be written as @xmath36 suggesting that the interface language is the natural one for this class .",
    "in fact , except for the factor 2 in front of @xmath37 eq .",
    "( [ mnminus ] ) coincides with the cole - hopf transform of @xmath38 that describes the growth of wetting layers toward their equilibrium state @xcite ( observe that this is just the equilibrium , edwards - wilkinson model , in the presence of a bounding wall ) .",
    "note also that the factor @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ mnminus ] ) can not be readsorbed by reparametrizing .",
    "finally , let us underline that in the regime where @xmath40 the wall becomes attractive ( which might be necessary to describe some physical situations as , for instance , synchronization problems as said in the introduction ) and a new term , say , @xmath41 ( equivalently @xmath42 ) with @xmath43 has to be added to stabilize the equation",
    ".    having presented the equations defining the model , in the forthcoming sections we study the associated physics by using i ) mean field approaches , ii ) field theory , and iii ) numerical , monte carlo simulations combined with scaling arguments .",
    "mean - field approaches to eq .",
    "( [ bkpz ] ) can be implemented with several degrees of sophistication .",
    "a crude approximation consists of ignoring the noise and spatial variations . at this level one",
    "trivially gets that the order parameter @xmath16 vanishes as @xmath44 with an exponent @xmath45 . when applied to eq.([mnminus ] ) , this approximation yields a shifted critical point at @xmath46 and the usual result for the order parameter critical exponent , @xmath47 .",
    "but , as experience with other systems with multiplicative - noise dictates , neglecting completely the noise is a too crude approximation , that eliminates most of the characteristic traits of mn physics .",
    "now the effect of allowing a spatially varying order parameter and taking the noise into consideration are examined .",
    "the laplacian is discretized as @xmath48 where the sum runs over the nearest neighbors of @xmath49 and a large system dimensionality has been assumed .",
    "similarly , the square gradient term can be written as @xmath50 the one - site stationary probability distribution is then readily obtained from the associated fokker - planck equation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to be calculated self - consistently . for @xmath54 ,",
    "@xmath55 is not normalizable what means that the stationary state is the absorbing phase @xmath56 . for @xmath57 , however , the non - analyticity of @xmath58 $ ] at @xmath59 again renders @xmath55 non - normalizable . as a result , there is no well - defined active phase at this mean - field level for eq .",
    "( [ pmnminus ] ) .",
    "similar problems are found if the same type of approach is applied to eq .",
    "( [ bkpz ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ mnminus ] ) .    to avoid the presence of the square gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ mnminus ] ) , and the complications of its , somewhat arbitrary , discretization , we resort to a different change of variables .",
    "after @xmath34 , @xmath60 .",
    "\\label{mnplus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations are simpler than ( [ mnminus ] ) and ( [ pmnminus ] ) , but at the cost that @xmath52 is no longer an order parameter as , at the transition point @xmath61 rather than going to @xmath62 . furthermore , landau expansions only make sense when the order parameter vanishes at the critical point , making the whole approach inconsistent .",
    "one possible way to circumvent this problem is to monitor @xmath63 , and study @xmath64 , but given the non - gaussian nature of the probability distribution the substitution @xmath65 is likely to be incorrect , and there seem to be no safe way to proceed .    summing up ,",
    "non - trivial mean - field approaches detect some problems with the model under consideration , and are not able to predict a phase correct phase diagram .",
    "a sound mean - field approximation , needs therefore to be found .",
    "notice that none of these problems occur in the case of a negative kpz non - linearity , _",
    "i.e. _ in the mn1 class , where a standard mean - field approximation yields qualitatively correct results ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the langevin equation for mn1 is known to be super - renormalizable , _",
    "i.e. _ feynman diagrams can be computed to all orders and resummated .",
    "this does not imply that critical exponents can be computed in all the cases , as the renormalization group flow - equation has runaway trajectories supposed to converge to a _",
    "strong coupling fixed point_. but at least , the correct phase diagram , including strong and weak coupling fixed points can be obtained .    for the mn2",
    "the situation is far more complicated , as can be _ a priori _ anticipated given the failure of mean - field approaches .",
    "the extra term , @xmath35 , being singular in @xmath66 precludes the use of perturbative expansions around @xmath59 .",
    "given the lack of a non - perturbative approach to the kpz and mn strong coupling fixed points , there is not much we can add to this section , except that there is a promising attempt to tackle this and related kpz - like problems .",
    "there is a formalism , developed by fogedby , aimed at developing a strong coupling theory for kpz based on a semiclassical or wkb approximation applied upon the martin - siggia - rose generating functional @xcite .",
    "its main advantage is that it does not involve expansions around classical noiseless solutions , but around classical ( extremal ) noisy solutions .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend these ideas to kpz problems in the presence walls , namely , to the multiplicative noise universality classes mn1 and mn2 .",
    "owing to the failure of standard ( non - trivial ) mean - field approaches and lacking so far of an alternative analytical route , numerical methods are required to glean insight into the system properties .",
    "we have carried out simulations of two surface growth models . both of them , in the absence of walls",
    ", are known to belong to the kpz universality class .",
    "an extra rule is then added to generate a bounding wall , as described above .",
    "our first model was introduced in @xcite and is defined as follows : the surface position at time @xmath67 above a site @xmath68 on a one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath69 is given by a continuous height variable @xmath70 . a new height configuration",

    "improved simulation results are provided upon revisiting the analysis reported in @xcite for larger system sizes and longer sampling times .",

    "<S> a host of spatially extended systems , both in physics and in other disciplines , are well described at a coarse - grained scale by a langevin equation with multiplicative - noise . </S>",
    "<S> such systems may exhibit non - equilibrium phase transitions , which can be classified into universality classes . here </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail one of such classes that can be mapped into a kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) interface equation with a positive ( negative ) non - linearity in the presence of a bounding lower ( upper ) wall . </S>",
    "<S> the wall limits the possible values taken by the height variable , introducing a lower ( upper ) cut - off , and induce a phase transition between a pinned ( active ) and a depinned ( absorbing ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is studied here using mean field and field theoretical arguments , as well as from a numerical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> its main properties and critical features , as well as some challenging theoretical difficulties , are reported . the differences with other multiplicative noise and bounded - kpz universality classes </S>",
    "<S> are stressed , and the effects caused by the introduction of `` attractive '' walls , relevant in some physical contexts , are also analyzed . </S>"
