    "through the years , there has been different connections between quantum mechanics and non - linear differential equations .",
    "the simplest case was studied by dirac @xcite between schrdinger and riccati equations , a second - order linear and first - order non - linear differential equations , respectively .",
    "further examples are the susy partners of the free particle potential , which lead to solutions of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xcite .    in these lecture notes",
    "we will study in detail the relation between supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , polynomial heisenberg algebras ( pha ) , and painlev equations .",
    "it has been known for years that specific pha were connected with solutions of some painlev equations and that the first - order susy partner potentials of the harmonic and radial oscillator were ruled by these algebras .",
    "now , several questions arise : can higher - order susy partners lead to additional solutions ? and if so , which are the corresponding conditions imposed on the quantum systems ?",
    "what kind of solutions do they lead to ? in this work we intent to answer all these questions .",
    "we will see that the second and third - order pha are related with painlev iv ( piv ) and painlev v ( pv ) equations respectively . not only that , but we will use higher - order susy qm to obtain systems described by these two kinds of algebras departing from the harmonic and the radial oscillators , which will allow us to find new solutions of piv and pv equations . after that , we will classify these solutions into the so called _ solution hierarchies _ , according to the specific special functions they are related with .    as far as we know , the first people who realized the connection between susy qm , second and third - order pha , and painlev equations were veselov and shabat @xcite , adler @xcite , and duvov et al .",
    ". this connection has been explored more thoroughly by fernndez , negro , nieto , and mateo @xcite and by bermudez and fernndez @xcite .",
    "these lecture notes are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will review briefly the susy qm , while in section 3 we will introduce the six painlev equations . in section 4",
    "we will define the pha and in section 5 we will describe the general systems characterized by them for the four lowest orders .",
    "then , in section 6 we will introduce our method to obtain solutions to piv equation and in section 7 we will do the same for pv : in each section we will present a reduction theorem which will guarantee the corresponding connection , as well as a classification of the solutions into hierarchies . finally , we will present our conclusions in section 8 .",
    "the factorization method , intertwining technique , and susy qm are closely related and their names will be used indistinctly in this work to characterize a specific method , through which it is possible to obtain new exactly - solvable quantum potentials departing from known ones .",

    "we introduced the six painlev equations .",
    "then , in section 4 , we defined the pha and in section 5 , we obtained the general systems described by these algebras from zeroth to third order . in this direction",
    ", we would like to continue this study to higher - order systems .    after that , in sections 6 and 7 we formulated two _ reduction theorems _ for the higher - order susy partners of the harmonic and radial oscillators in order to obtain new systems ruled by second and third - order pha .",
    "are those the only possible systems that can be reduced to these algebras ?",
    "we doubt it , and thus we would be interested in identifying new systems ruled by these pha .",
    "then through these reduction theorems we derived a method to obtain solutions to piv and pv equations in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function in certain subspace of the parameter space of the painlev equations . in this topic , we think it would be important to study further the general structure of these solutions , e.g. , their node distribution and asymptotic behaviour .",
    "furthermore , we have only scratched the surface of the explicit solutions , and we think it will be useful to explore deeper the method .    finally , we classified these solutions into different solution hierarchies . in this subject , we think that a more detailed classification lie still deeper into their structure .",
