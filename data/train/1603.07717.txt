    ", the resonator allows the opening of a positive full relative band gap between the third and fourth dispersion curves , associated with a non - negligible elastic coupling between the resonator and the cell structure .",
    "this achievement implied the optimization of a multiplicative trade - off between the band gap and the relative band amplitude of the fourth dispersion curve .",
    "all the optimization problems have been solved numerically by combining the method of moving asymptotes with a quasi - monte carlo multi - start technique .    as possible developments , the optimization framework could be extended to its regularized version , to reduce the sensitivity of the obtained solution with respect to changes in the nominal parameter values . to this aim ,",
