    "when a 1d crystal is driven incommensurate , for example , by doping to alter the fermi wavevector , it is well - known that the modulation of the commensurate crystalline order tends not to be uniform but to accumulate at kinks in the crystalline order parameter @xcite . a prototype for this is the su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite for polyacetylene , ( ch)@xmath2 . in a simple chemical view , the carbon chain has alternating single and double bonds .",

    "the one - dimensional domain wall in the 2d system is generally called a `` stripe . '' the 3d analog , which occurs in some cubic manganites @xcite , is a planar domain wall @xcite , sometimes called a `` sheet '' or `` lamella . ''",
    "we prefer the term `` slice , '' which , like the word `` stripe '' can be used as verb or noun . here we discuss a 3d model system in which bonding and strain energies favor slices , but long - range coulomb interactions prefer point defects .",

    "the bipolaron sytems ( 1 ) were ( a ) maximal spacing between bipolarons , obtained when they occupy center and corner sites of a tetragonal 16 atom unit cell ( _ bct _ structure ) ; ( b ) a simple cubic ( _ sc _ ) arrangement of bipolarons sitting at the corner sites of a 8 atom cubic cell ; ( c ) a disordered structure with random bipolaron positions ; ( d ) phase - separated structures based on unit cells containing 8 or 16 ( 111 ) planes , where we replace one or two near neighbor a planes with bipolaronic b planes , [ ( ab)@xmath3b@xmath79@xmath80 or [ ( ab)@xmath22b@xmath81@xmath82",

    "we start by guessing oxygen positions to get close to a local minimum in the energy landscape , then vary oxygen positions using a gradient minimization routine to find a self - consisistent minimum . for smaller periodic structure , we used @xmath87-space sampling in the corresponding brillouin zones ( 8000 k - points ) . for each @xmath88",

    "states are filled with two electrons up to the desired doping . for the random bipolaron structure we used large asymmetric clusters ( @xmath39400 atoms ) with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath90 only .",
    "initial oxygen - positions had peierls order with small random deviations .",
    "our calculations on random configurations generally reproduce the earlier calculations of yu _ et al .",

    "energies of various states at doping @xmath0=1/4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . in the atomic limit @xmath50",
    "all bipolaron and phase - slip structures are degenerate .",
    "all that is required is that no a site should have an a first neighbor . below a critical coupling strength @xmath91 ( @xmath92 for doping @xmath0=1/4 ) , distorted structures become unstable with respect to the undistorted metallic structure .",
    "above @xmath91 , we find numerically that at @xmath78 holes strongly prefer to order in phase - slips ( 2 ) .",
    "bipolaronic structures ( 1 ) are quite similar to each other in energy , and behave as expected from the the bipolaron - pair interaction . in the intermediate coupling range there occurs a cross - over from the tetragonal to the layered bbb - structure as stable bipolaron configuration , corresponding to a change in the overall bipolaron interaction from weakly repulsive to weakly attractive . for 1/4-doped babio@xmath3 ,",
    "the energy gain for the phase - slip solution compared to the bipolarons is about 50 - 65 mev per hole .",
    "thus , contrary to previous studies of doping of this model @xcite , we find that the stable doping state is not bipolarons but phase slips .",
    "does this model correspond sufficiently to reality for babio@xmath3 ?",
    "iwano and nasu @xcite use a more complicated hopping and electron - phonon interaction , but we believe that such corrections are not the relevant ones .",
    "there are also ( i ) small structural distortions ( rotations of oxygen octahedra ) beyond the breathing - mode distortions considered here , and ( ii ) non - adiabatic effects ( such as zero point motion ) associated with the fact that the oxygen mass is not infinitely large compared with the electron mass .",
    "we believe that both of these also have little relevance .",
    "it is harder to dismiss two other effects : ( iii ) the disorder caused by the dopant atoms , and ( iv ) the long - range coulomb interaction , both omitted so far . of these ,",
    "the last is clearly important , as we now show , and tends to destabilize phase - slips relative to distributed bipolarons .",
    "at low doping , there is a large coulomb cost in putting charges onto stacking faults instead of widely distributed point charges .",
    "we modeled this as follows .",
    "the madelung energy was computed by the ewald method for ( ba@xmath93)@xmath83(bi@xmath11bi@xmath13)(o@xmath94)@xmath22 .",
    "the calculation was re - done for many large unit cells , with holes added on selected bi ions ( bi@xmath95bi@xmath13 ) , and compensating negative charges distributed uniformly throughout space .",
    "this is one way to mimic potassium doping of babio@xmath96 .",
    "first consider the sliced state . by numerical calculation for uniformly distributed phase slips at many values of @xmath0 between 1/39 and 1/3",
    ", we found a good fit to the formula @xmath97 .",
    "the static electronic screening @xmath98 was measured by tajima _",
    "@xmath99 is the difference of energy per hole between the sliced solution and the undoped peierls insulator .",
    "the term @xmath100 is the analytic result for idealized uniform sheets of charge of vanishing thickness , arranged periodically in a compensating charge background .",
    "the term -25.1 corrects for the discreteness of the charges , the absence of the self - interaction , and includes the coulomb energy of the holes with the background babio@xmath3 lattice .",
    "we also need the energy difference per hole @xmath101 of optimally spaced bipolarons relative to the undoped peierls insulator . for doping @xmath102",
    "the bipolarons can be placed on a sublattice of face - centered cubic ( _ fcc _ ) form , with maximum spacing .",
    "numerical results for @xmath103=2 , 3 , and 4 fitted well to the formula @xmath104 .",
    "the term @xmath105 is the madelung energy of an _ fcc _ lattice of charges @xmath106 in a uniform compensating background , and the constant -21.2 accounts for the energy of the holes in the background babio@xmath3 lattice .",
    "the difference @xmath107 is the coulomb penalty per hole for forming slices or phase slips .",
    "it is plotted in fig [ fig : mad ] , becoming large at low @xmath0 with a shallow minimum near @xmath108 .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the coulomb penalty is shown as an * x * on fig [ fig : mad ] , and was obtained by doing ewald sums using the actual bi site charges ( @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the local occupancy of the bi @xmath8 states ) and the actual ( ab@xmath111b@xmath111abab@xmath111b@xmath111)@xmath80 slice structure and _ bct _ bipolaron structure .",
    "it is seen on the figure that at 1/4 doping , the coulomb penalty is twice as high as the peierls benefit in forming slices .",
    "these calculations did not account for the actual random positions of the compensating negative charges where ba@xmath93 ions are replaced by k@xmath112 ions .",
    "instead , the compensating charge was distributed uniformly .",
    "the calculations were repeated for a model where the compensating negative charges were equally shared by each ba atom ( ba@xmath113ba@xmath114 ) .",
    "this only changed the constant terms in @xmath99 and @xmath101 , but did not affect the difference , @xmath107 plotted here .",
    "the madelung sums discussed above are not the complete coulomb effect .",
    "the missing on - site repulsion has the opposite effect , preferring sliced solutions to distributed bipolarons .",
    "if we add back the local term @xmath115 and treat it as a first - order perturbation , the sliced solution at 1/4-doping has lower on - site energy by 0.121@xmath61 per hole than the _ bct _ bipolaron solution .",
    "using the value @xmath116ev from vielsack and weber @xcite , the onsite correction @xmath117ev is potentially sufficient to re - stabilize the sliced solution .",
    "thus we can say that the best place to look for sliced structures in babio@xmath3 is in the range near 1/4 to 1/3 doping , but we can not predict whether the sliced solution will be destroyed by disorder or coulomb effects .    doping 1/3 is the highest at which a simple sliced solution ( @xmath118 ) is possible . for higher doping ,",
    "either the a - planes acquire polaron defects or the sliced solution is destroyed and purely bipolaronic states win .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there have been reports @xcite ( subsequently attributed to electron beam heating effects @xcite ) of superlattice diffraction spots in doped babio@xmath3 , not apparently identical to the superstructures predicted here .",
    "a further search in the doping region @xmath119 would be interesting .",
