    "recently , the observations of high redshift type ia supernovae and the surveys of clusters of galaxies @xcite@xcite reveal cosmic acceleration .",
    "further , observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies indicates that the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical one @xcite .",
    "these data properly complete each other and designate that the so called dark energy ( de ) is the dominant component of the present universe , occupies about @xmath4 of the cosmic energy , while dark matter ( dm ) occupies @xmath5 , and the usual baryonic matter takes about @xmath6 .",
    "there are prominent candidates for de such as the cosmological constant @xcite , a dynamically evolving scalar field ( like quintessence ) @xcite or phantom field ( with negative energy ) @xcite that explain cosmic accelerating expansion .",
    "alternatively , the universe acceleration can also be elucidated through modified gravity @xcite , brane cosmology and so on @xcite@xcite .",
    "the de can track the evolution of the background matter in the early stage , and only recently , it becomes dominant .",
    "thus , its current condition is nearly independent of the initial conditions @xcite@xcite .    on the other hand , to explain the early and late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is most often the case that such fields interact with matter ; directly through matter lagrangian coupling , or indirectly by coupling to the ricci scalar as emerged from quantum loop corrections @xcite@xcite .",
    "if the scalar field self - interactions are negligible , then the experimental bounds on such a field are very strong ; requiring it to either couple to matter much more weakly than gravity does , or to be very heavy @xcite@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such fields are usually very light and its coupling to matter should be tuned to extremely small values in order not to be conflict with the equivalence principal @xcite .",
    "an attempt to overcome the problem with light scalar fields has been suggested in chameleon cosmology @xcite@xcite . in the proposed model , a scalar field couples to matter with gravitational strength , in harmony with general expectations from string theory whilst at the same time remaining very light on cosmological scales .",
    "the light field on cosmological scales is permitted to couple to matter much more strongly than gravity does , and yet still satisfies the current experimental constraints .",
    "the cosmological value of such a field evolves over hubble time - scales and could potentially cause the late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite . in this approach the mass of the scalar field depends on the local background matter density . while the idea of a density - dependent mass term is not new @xcite@xcite , in the work presented in @xcite @xcite the scalar field couples directly to matter with gravitational strength . in this paper , we stat with the assumption that the matter energy density is redshift dependent , @xmath2 .",
    "we therefore find that the chameleon scalar field has a greater contribution to the dynamic of the universe in higher redshifts .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section two",
    "we describe the chameleon mechanism .",
    "we assume two forms of power law and exponential potential functions and derive the required equations .",
    "section three is devoted to constrain the model parameters with the observational data using @xmath7 statistical method . in section four with numerical calculations and best fitted model parameters ,",
    "we revisit the chameleon mechanism and test the model against recent findings .",
    "summary and remarks are given in section five .",
    "we begin with the action of chameleon gravity given by , @xmath8\\sqrt{-g}dx^{4}\\nonumber\\\\+\\int { \\cal l}_m(\\psi^{(i ) } , g_{\\mu\\nu}^{(i)})dx^{4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matter fields @xmath9 are coupled to scalar field @xmath10 by the definition @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 are dimensionless coupling constants , one for each matter species . in the following ,",
    "we assume a single matter energy density component @xmath13 with coupling @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the variation of action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor components in a spatially flat frw cosmology yields the field equations , @xmath15 @xmath16 in deriving the field equations we assumed a perfect fluid for matter field with @xmath17 .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to scalar field @xmath10 provides the wave equation for chameleon field as @xmath18 where prime indicated differentiation with respect to @xmath10 . from equations ( [ fried1 ] ) , ( [ fried2 ] ) and ( [ phiequation ] )",
    ", one can easily arrive at the relation @xmath19 integrating the above equation yields @xmath20 where @xmath21 as a constant of integration . in the following",
    "we discuss two power - law and exponential forms for the potential in the model .",
    "* case 1 : *    the runaway inverse power - law potential , also called the ratra - peebles potential , in chameleon cosmology is often given as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant with the dimension of mass and @xmath24 is a positive constant .",
    "these kind of potentials are usually seen in quintessence models . the chameleon effective potential is then defined by , @xmath25 the sum of potential ( [ veff00 ] ) and its coupling to the matter density . using equation ( [ rom ] ) , the effective potential can be rewritten as @xmath26 one can also easily find the mass associated with the field @xmath10 from : @xmath27 for matter dominated universe , @xmath28 , and positive @xmath14 in the second term of @xmath29 , the effective potential monotonically decreases to a minimum at a finite field value @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we then lead to the following relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . from equation ( [ veff40 ] ) we find @xmath36 where @xmath37 is called @xmath38 or product - log function",
    ". we can also find minimum mass from @xmath39 using equation ( [ veff40 ] ) we can rewrite equation ( [ min0 ] ) as @xmath40 from @xmath41 we find @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a positive constant .",
    "thus , @xmath44 can be rewritten as @xmath45^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    * case2 : *    the exponential potential given by @xmath46 is also seen in many cosmological models .",
    "similar to the previous case , we find the effective potential , @xmath29 , the minimum mass @xmath47 , and the minimum scalar field , @xmath44 , respectively as @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath47 is the inverse of the characteristic range of the chameleon force in a given medium . in the next section",
    "we best fit the model with the observational data .",
    "we constrain the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath14 , and model parameter @xmath24 , in both exponential and power law potential , with the most recent observational data , sne ia , by employing the @xmath7 statistics .",
    "we assume that the energy density , @xmath51 , stands for the contribution from cold dark matter , @xmath28 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 . from table [ table:1 ]",
    "one finds the best fitted model parameters @xmath24 and @xmath14 in both cases of power law and exponential potentials .",

    "one sees that with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 confidence level the true values for both @xmath24 , @xmath14 lie within the red , green and blue contours , respectively .",

    "2 : the best fitted distance modulus @xmath58 in both cases plotted as function of redshift +    with the best fitted model parameters , in the next section , we study in more details the chameleon mechanism by performing cosmological tests .",
    "complementary to the conventional chameleon mechanism given in @xcite , here , we study the mechanism with respect to cosmological scales in different epoches . just as an example , we take two values for the matter energy density , @xmath59 and @xmath60 where the corresponding size of the universe is @xmath61 ( today ) and @xmath62 respectively . with the best fitted model parameters , in case of power law potential , the effective potential are shown in fig .",
    "3 : top and bottom . from the graph , as matter energy density , @xmath13 , decreases or alternatively @xmath63 , the minimum effective potential shifts to larger values of @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , the steepness of the effective potential , @xmath64 , near the minimum , also depends on @xmath13 ; a shallow minimum corresponds to a low chameleon mass .",
    "the mass of chameleon field , @xmath65 , increases with @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , chameleon field has a greater contribution , as the universe approaches its earlier epoches .",
    "the same argument applies to the case of exponential potential case ( fig .",

    "a comparison between power law and exponential potential scenarios for the best fitted model parameters with observation is shown .",
    "the graph illustrates that while , up to about @xmath66 , the trajectories of effective eos parameter in both scenarios overlap each other , they completely resolved afterward . since there is no direct measurement of eos parameter for the universe",
    ", one can not decide which form of potential is observationally privileged .",
    "the graph also shows that the current effective eos parameter for the best fitted model parameters in both cases is @xmath67 .",

    "6 the best fitted hubble parameter for both potential functions obtained from numerical calculation is compared with the observational data . as can be seen , for the redshift @xmath68 the two curves overlap and relatively agree with the observational data . within the distance @xmath69 , they again reasonably fit the data whereas have quite distinct shape . nevertheless , similar to the case of eos parameter ,",
    "the two curves begin to resolve at @xmath70 .",
    "again , the two models satisfy the observational data within the observationally fitted interval @xmath71",
    ". however , at this stage , since the model is not tested against data for higher redshifts , @xmath72 , one still can not decide which of the two scenarios is observationally preferable .",
    "+ fig . 6 : the best fitted hubble parameter for power law and exponential potential against observational data .",
    "+    next , we choose to compare the two models against observational data for velocity drift  @xcite where the data distributed over @xmath73 . with the velocity drift given by @xmath74 a comparison of the two models with the observational data for high redshift are shown in fig .",

    "this is also in agreement with the discussion given in @xcite .",
    "this paper examines the chameleon mechanism in cosmological scales by taking into consideration power - law and exponential potential functions .",
    "the work is supported by best fitting the model parameters with the observational data .",
    "departing from conventional approach to chameleon mechanism , we revisit the model of interacting chameleon field in the framework of cosmological scales .",
    "the result shows that in both cases of power - law and exponential potential the mass of interacting chameleon field reduces with the matter energy density .",
    "the two scenarios of power - law and exponential potential functions directly and indirectly are tested against observational data .",
    "we find that in the range of @xmath76 , the dynamic of the effective eos parameter is independent of the underlined models .",
    "however the circumstance is different in higher redshifts , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "the eos parameter also shows that the universe begins to accelerate at about @xmath77 and currently is in quintessence era .",
    "we perform two observational tests comparing the dynamics of the model in two scenarios . first , the best fitted hubble parameter derived from numerical computation in both cases are compared with the observational data . while both models are relativity in good agreement with the data for @xmath70 , no comparison can be made with the data for high redshifts .",
    "second , we compare the best fitted velocity drift computed in both scenarios with the data for high redshift , @xmath78 .",
    "the test shows a better agreement between the data and best fitted velocity drift in power law potential case .",
