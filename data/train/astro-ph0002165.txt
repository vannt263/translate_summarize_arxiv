    "the study of @xmath0-ray bursts was revolutionized when the italian - dutch satellite bepposax delivered arcminutes positioning of some grbs , within a few hours after the event .",
    "this enabled other ground and space instruments to monitor the relatively narrow error boxes .",
    "emission in x - ray , infrared , optical and radio , so called `` afterglow '' , was observed by now for more than a dozen of bursts .",
    "the current understanding of the grbs phenomenon is that a compact source emits relativistic flow with lorentz factor @xmath0 of at least a few hundreds .",
    "this flow emits , probably by internal shocks ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the grb . after these internal shocks have produced the grb , the ultra relativistic flow interacts with the surrounding medium and decelerates .",
    "synchrotron radiation is emitted by the heated surrounding matter .",
    "as more and more of the surrounding mass is accumulating , the flow decelerates and the emission shifts to lower and lower frequencies .",
    "excitingly , the afterglow theory is relatively simple .",
    "it deals with the emission on timescales much longer than those of the grbs .",
    "the details of the complex initial conditions are therefore forgotten and the evolution depends only on a small number of parameters .",
    "we begin by clarifying some of the confusing terminology .",
    "there are two distinct , but related , effects .",
    "the first , * `` jets '' * , describes scenarios in which the relativistic flow emitted from the source is not isotropic but collimated towards a finite solid angle .",
    "the term jet refers to the geometrical shape of the relativistic flow emitted from the inner engine .",
    "the second effect is that of * `` relativistic beaming''*. the radiation from any object that is radiating isotropically in its own rest frame , but moving with a large lorentz factor @xmath0 in the observer frame , is collimated into a small angle @xmath1 around its direction of motion .",
    "this is an effect of special relativity .",
    "it has nothing to do with the ejecta s geometry ( spherical or jet ) but only with the fact that the ejecta is moving relativisticly .",
    "the effect of relativistic beaming allows an observer to see only a small angular extent , of size @xmath1 centered around the line of sight .",
    "unfortunately , the term beaming was also used for `` jets '' by many authors ( including myself ) .",
    "we will keep a clear distinction between the two in this paper .",
    "since we know the flow is ultra - relativistic ( initially @xmath2 ) , there is no question that the relativistic beaming is always relevant for grbs .",
    "the question we are interested in is that of the existence of `` jets '' .    the idealized description of a jet is a flow that occupies only a conical volume with half opening angle @xmath3 .",
    "in fact the relativistic dynamics is such that the width of the matter in the direction of its propagation is much smaller than its distance from the source by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "the flow , therefore , does not fill the whole cone . instead it occupies only a thin disk at its base , looking more like a flying pancake @xcite - see figure [ grbjets ] .",
    "if the `` inner engine '' emits two such jets in opposite directions then the total solid angle towards which the flow is emitted is @xmath5 .",
    "the question whether the relativistic flow is in the form of a jet or a sphere has three important implications .    * the total emitted energy . * optical observations of afterglows enabled redshift determination , and therefore a reasonably accurate estimate of the distance , @xmath6 , to these events ( the uncertainty is now in the cosmological parameters of the universe ) . the so called `` isotropic energy '' can then be inferred from the fluence @xmath7 ( the total observed energy per unit area at earth ) as @xmath8 ( taking cosmological corrections into account , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the luminosity distance and @xmath11 is the redshift ) .",
    "the numbers obtained in this way range from @xmath12erg to @xmath13erg with the record of @xmath14erg held by the famous grb  990123 .",
    "these huge numbers approach the equivalent energy of a solar mass , all emitted in a few tens of seconds !",
    "these calculations assumed that the source emitted the same amount of energy towards all directions .",
    "if instead the emission is confined to some solid angle @xmath15 then the true energy is @xmath16 .",
    "as we show later @xmath15 is very weakly constrained by the grb itself and can be as low as @xmath17 .",
    "if so the true energy in each burst @xmath18 . we will show later",
    "that interpretation of the multi - wavelength afterglow lightcurves indeed indicates that some bursts are jets with solid angles considerably less than @xmath19 .",
    "the isotropic energy estimates may be fooling us by a few orders of magnitudes ! clearly this is of fundamental importance when considering models for the sources of grbs .",
    "* the event rate .",
    "* batse sees about one burst per day . with a few redshifts measured",
    "this translates to about @xmath20 bursts per year per galaxy .",
    "however , if the emission is collimated to @xmath21 then we do not see most of the events .",
    "the true event rate is then larger than that measured by batse by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "again this is of fundamental importance .",
    "clearly , the corrected grb event rate must not exceeds that of compact binary mergers or the birth rate of massive stars if these are to produce the majority of the observed grbs .    * the physical ejection mechanism .",
    "* clearly , different physical models are needed to explain collimated and isotropic emission .",
    "for example , in the collapsar model ( e.g. @xcite ) , relativistic ejecta that is capable of producing a grb is produced only around the rotation axis of the collapsing star with half opening angle of about @xmath23 .",
    "such models would have difficulties to explain isotropic bursts as well as very narrow jets .",
    "with these uncertainties we are therefore left with huge ignorance in how , how much and how many grbs are produces .",
    "the question as to whether the emission of grbs is spherical or collimated in jets is fundamental to almost all aspects of the grb phenomenon .",
    "when the ejecta interacts with the surrounding medium , a shock waves ( so called the forward shock ) is going through the cold ambient medium and heating it up to relativistic temperatures .",
    "the basic afterglow model assumes that electrons are accelerated by the shock into a powerlaw distribution of their lorentz factor @xmath24 : @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the lower cutoff of this distribution is assumed to be a fixed fraction of equipartition .",
    "it is also assumed that a considerable magnetic field is being built behind the shock , again characterized by a certain fraction of equipartition .",
    "the relativistic electrons then emit synchrotron radiation and produce the observed afterglow .",
    "the broad band spectrum of such emission was given by sari , piran & narayan @xcite ( see figure [ spnspec ] ) .",
    "at each instant , there are three characteristic frequencies : ( i ) @xmath27 which is the synchrotron frequency of the minimal energy electron , having a lorentz factor @xmath28 .",
    "( ii ) the cooling time of an electron is inverse proportional to its lorentz factor @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , electrons with a lorentz factor higher than some critical value @xmath30 can cool on the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "this characteristic lorentz factor corresponds to the `` cooling frequency '' @xmath31 .",
    "( iii ) below some critical frequency @xmath32 the flux is self absorbed and is given by the rayleigh - jeans portion of a black body spectrum .",
    "the broad band spectrum of the well studied grb 970508 @xcite is in very good agreement with the theoretical picture .",
    "we stress that the spectrum given above is quite robust .",
    "the only assumption is synchrotron radiation from a powerlaw distribution of relativistic electrons .",
    "the same spectrum will hold whether the shocks propagates into a constant density interstellar medium or a decreasing surrounding density produced earlier by the progenitor s wind",
    ". it will be valid whether the ejecta is spherical or jet - like , whether the equipartition parameters are constant with time or not .    on the contrary ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the spectrum is more subtle . the simplest evolution , which well describes the data of some bursts , is the spherical adiabatic model with a constant density ambient medium . in this scenario , @xmath33 or in terms of the observer time ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "given the evolution of @xmath36 one can derive the temporal evolution of the break frequencies and the results are indicated in figure [ spnspec ] .",
    "the peak flux , in the adiabatic , spherical constant ambient density model is constant with time .",
    "interestingly , due to the effect of relativistic beaming ( which is independent of jets ) we are only able to see an angular extent of @xmath37 during the grb itself where the lorentz factor @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , it is only regions of size @xmath1 that are causally connected .",
    "therefore , each fluid element evolves as if it is part of a sphere as long as @xmath39 . combining these two facts",
    ", we can not distinguish a jet from spherical ejecta as long as @xmath39 .",
    "however , as the afterglow evolves , @xmath0 decreases and it will eventually fall below the initial inverse opening angle of the jet . the observer will notice that some of the sphere is missing from the fact that less radiation is observed .",
    "this effect alone , will produce a significant break , steepening the lightcurve decay by a factor of @xmath40 even if the dynamics of each fluid element has not changed .",
    "the transition should occur at the time @xmath41 when @xmath42 . observing this time",
    "can therefore provide an estimate of the jet s opening angle according to @xmath43    additionally , rhoads @xcite has shown that at about the same time ( see however @xcite ) , the jet will begin to spread laterally so that its opening angle @xmath44 .",
    "the ejecta now encounters more surrounding matter and decelerates faster than in the spherical case .",
    "the lorentz factor now decays exponentially with the radius and as @xmath45 with observed time .",
    "taking this into account , the observed break is even more significant .",
    "the slow cooling spectrum given in figure [ spnspec ] evolves now with decreasing peak flux @xmath46 and the break frequencies evolve as @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this translate to a temporal decay in a given frequency as listed in table [ t : afterglow ] .",
    ".the spectral index @xmath50 and the temporal index @xmath51 as function of @xmath52 for a spherical and a jet - like evolution .",
    "typical values are quoted using @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter free relation between @xmath51 and @xmath50 is given for each case ( eliminating @xmath52 ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath51 between a jet and a sphere is always substantial at all frequencies . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the jet break is a hydrodynamic one .",
    "it should therefore appear at the same time at all frequencies - an achromatic break .",
    "though an achromatic break is considered to be a strong signature of a jet , one should keep in mind that any other hydrodynamic transition will also produce an achromatic break . to name a few : the transition from relativistic to non - relativistic dynamics , a jump in the ambient density or the supply of new energy from slower shells that catch up with the decelerated flow .",
    "however , the breaks produced by the transition from a spherical like evolution ( when @xmath39 ) to a spreading jet has a well defined prediction for the change in the temporal decay indices .",
    "the amount of break depends on the spectral regime that is observed .",
    "it can be seen from table [ t : afterglow ] that the break is substantial @xmath54 in all regimes and should be easily identified .",
    "finally we note that if jet s opening angle is of order unity , the total energy may still be about an order of magnitude lower than the isortropic estimate .",
    "however , in this case the break will be `` hidden '' as it will overlap the transition to non - relativistic dynamics .",
    "it was suggested that this is the case for grb  970508 @xcite",
    "evidence of a break from a shallow to a steep power law was first seen in grb 990123 @xcite . unfortunately the break was observed only in one optical band while the infrared data was ambiguous . yet ,",
    "the strongest evidence for this burst being a jet does not come from this optical break but rather from radio observations , as explained below .",
    "a famous and exciting event this year was the first detection of a bright ( 9th magnitude ) optical emission simultaneous with grb 990123 @xcite .",
    "another new ingredient in grb 990123 is a radio flare @xcite .",
    "contrary to previous afterglows , where the radio peaks around few weeks and then decays slowly , this burst had a fast rising flare , peaking around a day and then decaying quickly .",
    "sari and piran @xcite have shown that the bright optical flash and the radio flare are related . within a day",
    "the emission from the adiabatically cooling ejecta , that produced the @xmath55s optical flash shifts into the radio frequencies . given this interpretation , the regular forward shock emission should have come later , on the usuall few weeks timescale . the fact that this `` usual '' forward shock radio emission did not show up is in agreement with the interpretation of this burst as a `` jet '' which causes the emission to considerably weaken by the time the typical frequency @xmath56 arrives to radio frequencies .",
    "grb  990510 had a very clear break simultaneously in all optical bands and in radio @xcite .",
    "in grb  990123 and grb  990510 the transition times were about @xmath57 days and @xmath58 days reducing the isotropic energy estimate by a factor of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the total energy is now well below a solar rest mass !",
    "sari , piran & halpern @xcite have noted that the observed decays in grb afterglows that do not show a break are either of a shallow slope of @xmath61 or a very steep slope of @xmath62 .",
    "they argued that the rapidly decaying bursts are those in which the ejecta was a narrow jet and the break in the light curve was before the earliest observation .",
    "interestingly , evidence for jets are found when the inferred energy @xmath63 ( which does not take jets into account ) is the largest .",
    "this implies that jets may account for a considerable fraction of the wide luminosity distribution seen in grbs , and that the true energy distribution is less wide than it seems to be .",
    "an alternative explanation for these afterglows with fast decline is propagation into a medium with decreasing density , i.e. a wind produced earlier by the progenitor @xcite .",
    "we favor the jet interpretation for two reasons : ( i ) decreasing density only enhance the decay by @xmath64 for @xmath65 and does not enhance the decay at all for @xmath66 ( with typical parameters the optical and certainly the x - ray bands are above @xmath67 ) .",
    "the rest of the needed effect , in the wind interpretation , is associated with a higher value of the electron powerlaw distribution index @xmath52 ( @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 ) .",
    "why should the value of @xmath52 be different for shocks propagating into winds ?",
    "with the jet interpretation one can explain all afterglows with a single value of @xmath52 , as in @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the jets interpretation makes the luminosity distribution of grbs more narrow , since evidence for jets are found in bright events .",
    "clearly , these are circumstantial evidence . a more clear cut between these two possible interpretations can be done with the use of early afterglow observation , preferably at radio frequencies ( see @xcite ) .    in summary",
    ", there are several kind of afterglows :    * shallow decline * @xmath61 for as long as the afterglow can be observed . these are probably spherical or at least have a large opening angle ( e.g. grb  970508 ) .",
    "* fast decline * @xmath70 ( e.g. grb  980519 and grb  980326 ) .",
    "these are either narrow jets , in which the break was very early or they have high values of @xmath52 and propagate into decreasing density medium .    * breaks * : initially slow decline that changes into a fast decline .",
    "these are the best candidates for jets ( e.g. grb  990510 ) .",
    "an exciting possibility to further constrain the models and obtain a more direct proof of the geometrical picture of `` jets '' is to measure linear polarization .",
    "high levels of linear polarization are usually the smoking gun of synchrotron radiation .",
    "the direction of the polarization is perpendicular to the magnetic field and can be as high as @xmath71 .",
    "gruzinov & waxman and medvedev & loeb @xcite considered the emission from spherical ejecta which by symmetry should produce no polarization on the average , except for fluctuations of order of a few percent .",
    "polarization is more natural if the ejecta is a `` jet '' and the line of sight from the observer is with in the jet but does not coincide with its axis . in this case , the spherical symmetry is broken @xcite , and the natural polarization produced by synchrotron radiation should not vanish . for simplicity ,",
    "lets assume that the magnetic field behind the shock is directed along the shock s plane ( the results hold more generally , unless the magnetic field has no preferred direction ) . the synchrotron polarization from each part of the shock front , which is perpendicular to the magnetic field , is therefore directed radially .",
    "as long as the relativistic beaming angle @xmath1 is narrower than the physical size of the jet @xmath3 , one is able to see a full ring and therefore the radial polarization averages to zero ( the first frame , with @xmath72 of the left plot in figure [ polfig ] ) . as the flow decelerates , the relativistic beaming @xmath1 becomes comparable to @xmath3 and only a part of the ring is visible ; net polarization is then observed .",
    "note that due to the radial direction of the polarization from each fluid element , the total polarization is maximal when a quarter ( @xmath73 in figure [ polfig ] ) or when three quarters ( @xmath74 in figure [ polfig ] ) of the ring are missing ( or radiate less efficiently ) and vanishes for a full and for half ring .",
    "the polarization when more than half of the ring is missing is perpendicular to the polarization direction when less than half of it is missing .       at late stages",
    "the jet expands and since the offset of the observer from the physical center of the jet is constant , spherical symmetry is regained .",
    "the vanishing and re - occurrence of significant parts of the ring results in a unique prediction : there should be three peaks of polarization , with the polarization position angle during the central peak rotated by @xmath75 with respect to the other two peaks . in case",
    "the observer is very close to the center , more than half of the ring is always observed , and therefore only a single direction of polarization is expected .",
    "a few possible polarization light curve are presented in figure [ polfig ] .",
    "now when redshifts for grbs are routinely measured , the largest uncertainty in their energy budget and event rate is the possibility that the emission is not spherical but jet - like .",
    "we discussed the theory of afterglow from jet - like event .",
    "these should produce a substantial break at all frequencies .",
    "the time where this break occurs is an indication of the jets opening angle .",
    "grb  990510 seems to be a perfect example for this behavior .",
    "the inferred opening angle is about @xmath76 consistent with upper limits from searches of orphan x - ray afterglows @xcite .",
    "several other candidate for jets are bursts with fast decline , where the break presumably took place before the earliest observation .",
    "this question will be settled when more frequent early observations are available .",
    "we have shown that afterglow from jets should show a unique signature of polarization , at detectable levels .",
    "observing such signature will confirm the jet interpretation and the synchrotron model in general ."
