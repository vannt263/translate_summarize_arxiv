    "in our recent work , the co@xmath0 molecule was identified for the first time in the spectra of brown dwarfs observed with the infrared astronomical satellite _ akari _",
    "* hereafter referred to as paper  i ) .",
    "we tried to interpret the observed behavior of the co@xmath0 band with the use of the model photosphere of brown dwarfs , referred to as the unified cloudy model ( ucm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in modeling the photospheres of brown dwarfs ,",
    "one problem is how to consider the chemical composition , since no direct abundance analysis is known for brown dwarfs .",
    "we thought it reasonable to assume a typical composition for the disk stellar population such as the sun .",
    "however , the solar composition itself experienced drastic changes in the past decades , and the true chemical composition of the sun is still by no means well established",
    ". nevertheless , we thought it appropriate to use the latest version of the solar abundances as possible proxies for the chemical abundances in the brown dwarfs .    in our earlier version of ucms @xcite , we assumed the solar abundances largely based on the classical lte analysis using one dimensional ( 1d ) hydrostatic model photospheres and , in particular , c & o abundances were log@xmath5 and log@xmath6 on the scale of log@xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at about the same time",
    "as we were computing our first version of ucms , a new result for the solar c & o abundances based on three dimensional ( 3d ) time - dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere was published @xcite .",
    "since the classical 1d model may be too simplified for the real solar photosphere , this new approach seemed to be a useful contribution to the solar abundance analysis .",
    "the current version of ucms @xcite is thus based on this new result ( log@xmath7 and log@xmath8 ) by @xcite as noted elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the new c & o abundances are about 0.2dex smaller as compared to the classical values referred to above .",
    "we applied our current version of ucms to the brown dwarfs observed with _",
    "akari _ in paper  i , and we could explain about half of our sample of spectra almost perfectly . for the other half of our targets , we could explain the overall seds by this version of ucms , but we could not explain their strong co@xmath0 bands .",
    "one explanation is that this may be due to an unknown process related to co@xmath0 , since anomalously strong co band depths have also been explained by a special process now known as vertical mixing .",
    "however , we happened to try our old version of ucms based on the classical c & o abundances and found that the co@xmath0 band appeared to be much stronger in the spectra based on the old models than on the present models . at the first glance ,",
    "this is rather surprising because c & o abundances in the old models are only about 0.2dex larger than those in the present models .",
    "however , we realized immediately that the co@xmath0 abundance is extremely sensitive to both c & o abundances because the co@xmath0 abundance depends on the cube of c & o abundances ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we recall that the strong dependence of the co@xmath0 abundance on metallicity , [ fe / h],= log@xmath11 - log@xmath12 . ]",
    "was previously known by a detailed thermochemical analysis of the c , n , and o bearing gaseous molecules @xcite .",
    "the above result demonstrates that at least two different series of model photospheres are needed for the analysis of the co@xmath0 band observed with _ akari_. for this purpose , we reconsider our old version of ucms based on the classical c & o abundances to represent a case of rather high c & o abundances",
    ". our current version of ucms based on the new c & o abundances will serve as representing a case of the reduced c & o abundances compared to the old version of the ucms .",
    "an important implication of this result is that the metallicity ( c & o abundances ) in brown dwarfs should have a variety of values .",
    "the interpretation and analysis of the spectra of cool dwarfs already have a rather long history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the effect of metallicity has been discussed by some authors .",
    "for example , @xcite have measured the strengths of the major h@xmath0o and ch@xmath13 bands in the 1.02.5@xmath1 m region in a large sample of t dwarfs , and found that the resultant spectral indices plotted against spectral type revealed considerable scatter .",
    "several reasons for this result including the effects of dust , gravity , and metallicity have been considered , but it appeared difficult to separate the effect of metallicity from the remaining paremeters . @xcite",
    "have shown that the effect of metallicity on the seds of t dwarfs should be significant , but noted that other parameters such as gravity can affect the seds similarly .",
    "this result again showed the difficulty in determining metallicity uniquely from seds .",
    "also , the so - called `` blue '' l dwarfs classified as l subdwarfs have been interpreted to have low metallicity with [ fe / h ] from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but those l dwarfs with unusually blue near - infrared colors can also be explained by a patchy cloud model @xcite .",
    "the brief survey outlined above reveals that the problem of metallicity in brown dwarfs is still unresolved . in this paper",
    ", we will show clear evidence of metallicity variations in brown dwarfs for the first time .",
    "in fact , the most important significance of the discovery of co@xmath0 with _",
    "akari _ is that it demonstrated the variations of the c & o abundances by at least 50% in brown dwarfs and that it provided a means by which to estimate the c & o abundances in very cool dwarfs .    in paper i",
    ", we have analyzed the _",
    "spectra and discussed the basic physical parameters of our objects in detail .",
    "there we have applied the conventional method based on a direct comparison of the observed and predicted spectra . in this paper , we examine the results of paper  i by a more detailed numerical method in section  [ sec : fitcmp ] , and we confirm that the physical parameters determined in paper  i mostly agree with those based on the reduced - chi - square minimization method within the estimated errors .",
    "a problem , however , is that an adequate application of such a rigorous numerical method requires the input data of sufficient accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , the input data  our present models of brown dwarfs  are not precise enough for this purpose , as discussed in section  4.5 of paper i. therefore the numerical method does not necessarily provide the best answer and the traditional fitting method `` by eye '' can still be useful for some cases .",
    "for these reasons , we use the physical parameters determined in paper  i and adopt the same approach as paper  i , eye - fitting , throughout this paper .",

    "we show a simple comparison of the photospheric structures of the ucm - a and ucm - c series for the cases of @xmath21 = 900 , 1200 , and 1500k in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "other parameters such as @xmath22 and log @xmath23 are chosen to be those actually found for our objects ( see table  [ tbl : fit ] ) .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] reveals that the models of the ucm - a series shown by the dashed lines are generally warmer by up to about 100k as compared to the models of the ucm - c series shown by the solid lines . since the major opacity sources such as co and h@xmath0o are more abundant in the ucm - a than in the ucm - c series ,",
    "the blanketing effect due to molecular bands should be more effective and hence the models of the ucm - a series are warmer than those of the ucm - c series .",
    "next , we examine the effects of c & o abundances on the co@xmath0 and other molecular abundances .",
    "we present the abundances of h@xmath0o , co , co@xmath0 , and ch@xmath13 for the case of @xmath21 = 1500k , @xmath24 = 1700k , and @xmath25 for the models of the ucm - c ( applied to 2mass j152322@xmath263014 in section  [ sec : spc ] ) and ucm - a ( applied to sdss j083008@xmath264828 ) series in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] as the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the increased c & o abundances result in the increases of co , co@xmath0 , and h@xmath0o abundances as expected .",
    "the increase of the co@xmath0 abundance in the ucm - a series is quite significant for the reason noted before . on the contrary",
    ", the ch@xmath13 abundance shows a decrease in the ucm - a series and this unexpected result may be because the direct effect of the increased carbon abundance on the ch@xmath13 abundance is superseded by the dissociation of ch@xmath13 due to the elevated temperatures in the model of the ucm - a series ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "as another example , we show the case of @xmath21 = 1200k , @xmath24 = 1900k , and @xmath25 in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the results are again shown for the ucm - c and ucm - a series with the solid and dashed lines , respectively . in this case , the effects of the abundance changes are more pronounced , especially for co@xmath0 .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : spc ] that the case of the ucm - a series is approximately realized in 2mass j055919@xmath271404 in which the co@xmath0 band appears to be very strong .",
    "we compare the observed spectra of six brown dwarfs with the predicted ones based on the models of the ucm - a and ucm - c series in figure  [ fig : six ] ( a)(f ) .",
    "the effect of c & o abundances on the spectra of brown dwarfs can be seen most clearly in a comparison of 2mass j152322@xmath263014 and sdss j083008@xmath264828 shown in figure  [ fig : six](c ) and figure  [ fig : six](d ) , respectively .",
    "these two brown dwarfs were found to have nearly the same physical parameters ( @xmath28k , @xmath29k , and log@xmath23 = 4.5 ) but the spectra looked to be quite different ( paper  i ) . in particular , the co@xmath0 band at 4.2@xmath1 m appeared to be much stronger in sdss j083008@xmath264828 than in 2mass j152322@xmath263014 . in 2mass j152322@xmath263014 , the observed spectrum could be accounted for by the model of the ucm - c series ( paper i ) , as confirmed by curve  1 in figure  [ fig : six](c ) : especially , the regions of the h@xmath0o 2.7@xmath1 m and the co@xmath0 4.2@xmath1 m bands as well as the @xmath30-branch of ch@xmath13 band appeared to be well explained by the model of the ucm - c series .",
    "on the other hand , the predicted spectrum based on the model of the ucm - a series shown by curve  2 can not explain those features .",
    "in sdss j083008@xmath264828 shown in figure  [ fig : six](d ) , the observed spectrum could not be accounted for by the model of the ucm - c series ( paper  i ) , as confirmed by curve  1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong co@xmath0 band at 4.2@xmath1 m can now be explained reasonably well by the model of the ucm - a series , as shown by curve  2 in figure  [ fig : six](d ) .",
    "thus the large depression due to the co@xmath0 band turns out to be due to the high c & o abundances in a lte model .",
    "it is to be noted that this result is due to the increase of both c & o abundances .",
    "in fact , a change of the c abundance alone , for example , produced only minor change on the co@xmath0 band strength ( paper  i ) . the large depression over the 2.7@xmath1 m region mostly due to h@xmath0o can also be better explained with the model of the ucm - a series . on the contrary",
    ", the @xmath30-branch of the ch@xmath13 band appears to be weaker with the model of the ucm - a than with that of the ucm - c series , consistent with the decrease of the ch@xmath13 in the ucm - a compared to the ucm - c series ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) . also , the observed ch@xmath13 @xmath30-branch indeed agrees better with the predicted one based on the model of ucm - a .",

    "we could not explain the co@xmath0 and co bands in this object with our ucm - c series ( paper i ) , as confirmed by curve  1 .",
    "but we can now explain the strong co@xmath0 band approximately with our model of the ucm - a series , as shown by curve  2 .",
    "this result is fairly consistent with the very large increase of the co@xmath0 abundance for this model as noted in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the fit of curve  2 based on the ucm - a series can in principle be improved further by a fine tuning of c & o abundances .",
    "but we defer such a detailed abundance analysis to future works and we only note here that the strength of the co@xmath0 band is adjustable by changing c & o abundances .",
    "lastly , we examine the case of 2mass j041519@xmath270935 in figure  [ fig : six](f ) . this is a case in which the fitting parameters had to be changed from the result of paper  i",

    ", the observed spectrum can be explained by the model of a higher effective temperature of @xmath47k with the model of the ucm - a series . also , we find that the case of log@xmath48 provides the best fit as shown in figure  [ fig : j0415](b ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that ( @xmath49 , @xmath24 , log@xmath23 ) = ( 900 , @xmath50 , 4.5 ) for 2mass j041519@xmath270935 for the models of the ucm - a series .",
    "we show the best possible predicted spectrum based on the model of the ucm - c series with @xmath46k and that based on the model of the ucm - a series with @xmath47k by curve  1 and curve  2 , respectively , in figure  [ fig : six](f ) .",
    "we see that the model of the ucm - a series appears to match better with the observed spectrum than the model of the ucm - c series .",
    "finally , we summarize the basic parameters of the six brown dwarfs in table  [ tbl : fit ] .",
    "the major change from table  4 of paper  i is to have introduced abundance classes in column 3 indicated by the ucm series applied : ucm - a and ucm - c means that c & o abundances should be close to those of the 1d and 3d solar abundances , respectively .",
    "the physical parameters are re - examined with the models of the ucm - a series in the same manner as in paper  i. a major change in physical parameter is @xmath21 for 2mass j041519@xmath270935 , which is changed from 800k to 900k as shown in figure  [ fig : j0415](a ) .",
    "as for other five objects , the physical parameters for the models of the ucm - a series remain the same as for the ucm - c series .",
    "we confirm that the overall seds based on the models of the ucm - a and ucm - c series of the same physical parameters agree well ( see figure  [ fig : six ] ) even though some local features due to the co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o bands differ somewhat .",
    "thus , it is natural that the physical parameters mainly derived from the fits of the overall seds remain the same for ucm - a and ucm - c series .",
    "the @xmath51 values for sdss j083008@xmath264828 , 2mass j055919@xmath271404 , and 2mass j041519@xmath270935 are changed slightly , reflecting the changes of models from the ucm - c to the ucm - a series .",
    "fitting of the model spectra to the observed spectra is carried out by `` eyes '' throughout in this paper as well as paper  i. the reader might wonder whether the eye - fitting can find reliable `` best '' models for various objects . in this subsection",
    "we assess our eye - fitting by comparing with the numerical fitting results .",
    "we evaluate the goodness of fit by the reduced - chi - square ( hereafter @xmath52 ) defined as , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are fluxes of the observed and model spectra at @xmath56-th wavelength grid , respectively .",

    "consideration of near - infrared data such as 2mass photometry or ground - based spectroscopy will enable constraining the model parameters better ( sorahana et al .",
    "in preparation ) .",
    "such improvements in spectral range will also help us to evaluate the goodness of the fit in the wavelengths beyond 4@xmath1 m .",
    "the very strong co@xmath0 feature observed with _",
    "akari _ in some brown dwarfs has remained a puzzle ( paper  i ) , but we find that this is simply due to the effect of c & o abundances .",
    "generally , a small change in the chemical composition does not have a large effect on the predicted spectra at low resolution nor on the thermal structure of the photosphere in hotter stars .",
    "in fact , this is the reason why one dimensional spectral classification ( e.g. harvard system ) is possible for such stars .",
    "but in the case of cool stars , a small change of the chemical composition is amplified in molecular abundances .",
    "a drastic example is the spectral branching of cool giant stars into m , s , and c types according to whether the c / o ratio is smaller or larger than unity . in cool dwarfs ,",
    "the change of c & o abundances also produces significant effect on the strengths of molecular bands as well as on the photospheric structures because of the large molecular opacities .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : spc ] reveal that half of the brown dwarf spectra observed with _ akari _ ( i.e. sdss j053952@xmath270059 , sdss j144600@xmath260024 , and 2mass j152322@xmath263014 )",
    "can be fitted by the predicted spectra based on the models of the ucm - c series ( paper  i ) .",
    "although the fits are by no means perfect , the fits with the predicted spectra based on the ucm - c series are better than those based on the umc - a series . for this reason , c & o abundances in these three brown dwarfs should be closer to the recent 3d solar abundances rather than to the classical 1d solar abundances .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining half ( i.e. sdss j083008@xmath264828 , 2mass j055919@xmath271404 , and 2mass j041519@xmath270935 ) of our sample can be reasonably accounted for by the models of the ucm - a series .",
    "therefore , c & o abundances in these three objects should be closer to the classical 1d solar abundances rather than to the recent 3d solar abundances .    since [ fe / h ] of the main sequence stars in the galactic disk covers the range from @xmath69 to + 0.2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the same metallicity distribution may apply to brown dwarfs .",
    "it is certainly only by chance that the brown dwarfs we have observed are divided into two groups by c & o abundances .",
    "our sample is too small to investigate the metallicity distribution in brown dwarfs , and we hope that this problem can be pursued further with a larger sample .    the problem of the solar c & o abundances is still under intensive discussion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although our problem here is not the solar composition , it is of some interest to know which of the proposed solar composition results more realistic for the sun .",
    "if the recent 3d result is more realistic for the sun , three of our sample may have about solar composition and the remaining three may be about 0.2dex more metal rich .",
    "this means that the proportion of metal rich objects with the highest [ fe / h ] of about + 0.2 is quite high in our present sample of brown dwarfs .",
    "we have shown that c & o abundances have significant effects on the 2.55.0@xmath1 m spectra of brown dwarfs , and we now examine their effect on the 0.92.5@xmath1 m spectra . as examples ,",
    "we compare the predicted 0.92.5@xmath1 m spectra of the models of ucm - a and ucm - c series for the case of @xmath29k , @xmath28k , and log@xmath23 = 4.5 , together with those for the 2.55.0@xmath1 m spectra in figure  [ fig : nir ] .",
    "the major difference between the ucm - a and ucm - c series is that h@xmath0o bands at 1.1 , 1.4 , 1.9 , and 2.7@xmath1 m are all stronger in the ucm - a ( curve  2 in figure  [ fig : nir ] ) than in the ucm - c series ( curve  1 ) , and this is due to a direct effect of the increased oxygen abundance ( see figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus the h@xmath0o band strengths depend sensitively on oxygen abundance , and we may hope to determine oxygen abundance from the h@xmath0o bands . however , we must remember that the h@xmath0o band strengths also depend on other parameters such as @xmath24 , @xmath49 , and log@xmath23 , and we should encounter the same difficulty due to a degeneracy of the parameters as noted before by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this fact reconfirms the unique role of co@xmath0 as a metallicity ( c & o abundances ) indicator in brown dwarfs .",
    "thanks to the _ akari _ spectra , we are for the first time able to demonstrate that the metallicity , more specifically c & o abundances , are important parameters to understand brown dwarf atmospheres . until now",
    ", we have assumed that it was sufficient to use one sequence of model photospheres based on a representative chemical composition in analyzing low resolution spectra of cool dwarfs .",
    "we must now admit that such an assumption is inappropriate , and we should consider abundance effects more carefully , especially of c & o , in our future analysis of cool dwarfs . also , we can not use any solar composition for cool dwarfs unless this substitution can be justified by a direct analysis of the spectra of cool dwarfs .",
    "it is true that a detailed abundance analysis of brown dwarfs is difficult especially with low resolution spectra , but well defined molecular bands , even at low resolution , can be potential abundance indicators . we know already that co@xmath70 is a fine indicator of c & o abundances .",
    "unfortunately , however , co@xmath0 is accessible only from space telescopes and , moreover , spectroscopic observations in the near infrared are mostly neglected by the recent space infrared missions . from the view point of the study on cool dwarfs ( and other cool stars ) , the importance of observing the near infrared spectra ( especially between 2.5 and 5.0@xmath1 m ) from space can not be emphasized too much .",
    "although the spectra of brown dwarfs appear to be complicated , we are now convinced that the spectra of brown dwarfs can basically be understood on the basis of the lte model photospheres , but only if the chemical composition is properly considered .",
    "this is a reasonable result for such high density photospheres as of brown dwarfs in which frequent collisions easily maintain thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus the chemical composition is the most important ingredient in the interpretation and analysis of even low resolution spectra .",
    "now , with better observed data for brown dwarfs including those from space , analysis of the spectra and abundance determination can be done iteratively for brown dwarfs as for ordinary stars .",
    "finally , we must remember that a major difficulty in the analysis of the spectra of brown dwarfs is that we have no model of comparable accuracy as for ordinary stars yet .",
    "for this reason , even the accurate numerical method such as outlined in section  [ sec : fitcmp ] can not be infallible .",
    "in fact , we have no model reproducing all the observable features correctly , and the model found by the numerical method as well as by the eye - fitting method may prove incorrect even if they are relatively satisfactory among the models currently available . within this limitation , we hope that our main results on the differential effects of c & o abundances are relatively free of present brown dwarf model uncertainties .",
