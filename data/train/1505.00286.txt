    "in the perturbative construction of models in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes one encounters time  ordered products of field polynomials which are a priori ill  defined due to the appearance of uv divergences .",
    "several renormalisation schemes which deal with these divergences in the presence of non  trivial spacetime curvature have been discussed in the literature , such as for example local momentum space methods @xcite , dimensional regularisation in combination with heat kernel techniques @xcite , differential renormalisation @xcite , zeta  function renormalisation @xcite , generic epstein ",
    "glaser renormalisation @xcite , and , on cosmological spacetimes , mellin ",
    "barnes techniques @xcite and dimensional regularisation with respect to the comoving spatial coordinates @xcite .",
    "some of these schemes , such as heat kernel approaches , zeta ",
    "function techniques and local momentum space methods are based on constructions which are initially only well  defined for spacetimes with euclidean signature .",
    "these constructions can be partly transported to general lorentzian spacetimes by local wick  rotation techniques developed in @xcite . however , whereas the feynman propagator is essentially unique on euclidean spacetimes , this is not the case on lorentzian spacetimes where this propagator has a non  unique contribution depending on the quantum state of the field model .",
    "consequently , the euclidean renormalisation techniques , and the numerous practical computations already performed by means of these methods  see for example the monographs @xcite  are able to capture the correct divergent and geometric parts of feynman amplitudes , but a priori not their non  geometric and state  dependent contributions .",
    "a renormalisation scheme which is directly applicable to curved spacetimes with lorentzian signature has been developed in @xcite in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory .",
    "this scheme implements ideas of @xcite and @xcite and is based on microlocal techniques which replace the momentum space methods available in minkowski spacetime and have been introduced to quantum field theory in curved spacetime by the seminal work @xcite . however , although the generalised epstein  glaser scheme developed in @xcite is conceptually clear and mathematically rigorous , it is not easily applicable in practical computations . on the other hand ,",
    "lorentzian schemes which are better suited for this purpose have not been developed to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite , are tailored to specific spacetimes @xcite or are not manifestly covariant @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we develop a renormalisation scheme for time  ordered products in interacting field theories on curved spacetimes which is directly applicable to spacetimes with lorentzian signature , manifestly generally covariant , invariant under any spacetime isometries present and constructed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , the scheme captures correctly the non  geometric state ",
    "dependent contribution of feynman amplitudes and it is well  suited for practical computations . in this work , we discuss only scalar fields in four spacetime dimensions , but we shall argue that the renormalisation scheme can be directly generalised to other spacetime dimensions and field theories with higher spin , as well as to theories with local gauge invariance",
    ". our analysis will take place in the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory ( paqft ) @xcite which is a conceptually clear framework in which fundamental physical properties of perturbative interacting models on curved spacetimes can be discussed .",
    "however , we will make an effort to review how the formulation of paqft is related to the more standard formulation of perturbative qft .",

    ", we introduce an analytic regularisation @xmath0 of a feynman propagator @xmath1 by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the so  called hadamard coefficients and @xmath6 is @xmath7 times the squared geodesic distance .",
    "this analytic regularisation , namely the construction of certain distributions by means of powers of the geodesic distance , is reminiscent of the use of riesz distributions to define advanced and retarded greens functions on minkowski spacetime . a careful discussion of riesz distributions and their extension to the curved case is presented in @xcite .",
    "the regularisation we use is loosely related to dimensional regularisation because the leading singularity of a feynman propagator in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions is proportional to @xmath9 , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) .",
    "a regularisation of the feynman propagator similar to the one above has recently been discussed in @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall combine the analytic regularisation of the feynman propagator with the minimal subtraction scheme encoded in a forest formula of the kind discussed in @xcite in order to obtain a time  ordered product which satisfies the causal factorisation property , i.e. a product which is indeed `` time  ordered '' . in order to prove that the analytically regularised amplitudes constructed out of @xmath0 have the meromorphic structure necessary for the application of the forest formula and in order to show how the corresponding laurent series can be computed explicitly , we shall make use of generalised euler operators .",
    "the practical feasibility of the renormalisation scheme shall be demonstrated by computing a few examples .",
    "a large part of our analysis is devoted to demonstrating that the scheme we propose is consistent and well - defined on general curved spacetimes .",
    "readers interested in directly applying our scheme may use proposition [ pr : expose - poles ] with and in order to compute the laurent - series of the feynman amplitudes regularised by means of .",
    "the correct order of pole subtractions is encoded in the forest formula which is explained prior to its display .",
    "a number of examples is discussed in section [ sec_fishsunset ] .    in quantum field theory on cosmological spacetimes , i.e. friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) spacetimes , one usually exploits the high symmetry of these spacetimes in order to evaluate analytical expressions in spatial fourier space .",
    "however , the renormalisation scheme discussed in this work operates on quantities such as the geodesic distance and the hadamard coefficients , whose explicit position space and momentum space forms are not even explicitly known in flrw spacetimes .",
    "notwithstanding , we shall devote a large part of this work in order to develop simple methods to evaluate quantities renormalised in our scheme on flrw spacetimes in momentum space , and we shall illustrate these methods by explicit examples .    the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in the next section we present a brief introduction to paqft and its connection with the more standard formulation of perturbative qft .",
    "afterwards we introduce the renormalisation scheme , demonstrate that it is well  defined and analyse its properties in section 3 , where we also illustrate the scheme by computing examples . in the fourth section we demonstrate the applicability of the renormalisation scheme to momentum space computations on cosmological spacetimes . finally , a few conclusions are drawn in the last section of this paper .",
    "conventions regarding the various propagators of a scalar field theory and a few technical computations are collected in the appendix .",
    "throughout this work , we shall consider four - dimensional globally hyperbolic spactimes @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a lorentzian metric whose signature is @xmath12 and we use the sign conventions of @xcite regarding the definitions of curvature tensors .",
    "we recall the perturbative construction of an interacting quantum field theory on a generic curved spacetime in the framework of * perturbative algebraic quantum field theory ( paqft ) * recently developed in @xcite based on earlier work . in this construction ,",
    "the basic object of the theory is an algebra of observables which is realised as a suitable set of functionals on field configurations equipped with a suitable product . in order to implement the perturbative constructions following the ideas of bogoliubov and others , the * field configurations * @xmath13 are assumed to be off  shell .",
    "namely , @xmath14 is a smooth function on the globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath10 and observables are modelled by functionals @xmath15 satisfying further properties .",

    "further regularity properties are assumed for the construction of an algebraic product . in particular ,",
    "the set of * local functionals * @xmath20 is formed by the functionals whose @xmath21th order functional derivatives are supported on the total diagonal @xmath22 . furthermore , their singular directions are required to be orthogonal to @xmath23 , namely @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the wave front set .",

    "consequently , we may consider the algebra @xmath54 @xmath33generated by iterated @xmath43products of local functionals .",
    "this algebra contains all observables of the free theory which are relevant for perturbation theory .    in the perturbative construction of interacting models ,",
    "namely when the free action is perturbed by a non  linear local functional @xmath55 , the observables associated with the interacting theory are represented on the free algebra @xmath54 by means of the * bogoliubov formula*. this is given in terms of the local @xmath56matrix , i.e. , the time  ordered exponential [ def : smatrix ] s(v)=^_n=0_n , where @xmath55 is the interacting lagrangean .",
    "in particular , for every interacting observable @xmath16 the corresponding representation on the free algebra @xmath54 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inverse of @xmath59 with respect to the @xmath33product .",
    "the problem in using @xmath60 as generators of the algebra of interacting observables lies in the construction of the time  ordered product which a priori is an ill  defined operation .    this problem can be solved using ideas which go back to epstein and glaser , see e.g. @xcite , by means of which the time  ordered product among local functionals is constructed recursively .",

    "in addition to the properties already discussed , the renormalised time  ordered product is required to satisfy further physically reasonable conditions .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details on these properties and the proof that they can be implemented in the recursive epstein ",
    "glaser construction .    in spite of the theoretical clarity of this construction , the epstein ",
    "glaser renormalisation is quite difficult to implement in practise .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss a renormalisation scheme which is suitable for practical computations .      in this subsection",
    "we outline the relation of the paqft framework to the standard formulation of perturbative qft . as an example",
    ", we demonstrate how the two - point ( wightman ) function of the interacting field in @xmath61 theory on a four  dimensional curved spacetime is computed , where we assume that the quantum state of the interacting field is just the state of free field modified by the interacting dynamics .",
    "we further assume that the free field is in a pure and gaussian hadamard state .",

    "our aim is to compute expectation values in this section , we shall write the results in the adiabatic limit keeping in mind that proving the absence of infrared problems , i.e. the convergence of the spacetime integrals , is non  trivial and may depend on the state of the free field chosen .",
    "note that the so - called `` in  in  formalism '' often used in perturbative qft on cosmological spacetimes corresponds to considering a cutoff function @xmath71 of the form @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath71 is a step function in time and the parameter @xmath74 corresponds to the time where the interaction is switched on .",
    "our choice for the quantum state @xmath75 of the interacting field implies that e.g. the interacting two - point function @xmath76 is computed by writing @xmath77 in terms of the free field @xmath13 and computing the expectation value of the resulting observable of the free field in the chosen pure , gaussian , hadamard state of the free field which we may thus denote by the same symbol @xmath75 .",
    "the interacting vacuum state in minkowski spacetime is of this form , whereas interacting thermal states in flat spacetime do not belong to this class , as they roughly speaking require to take into account both the change of dynamics and the change of spectral properties induced by @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the functionals in the functional picture of paqft correspond to wick  ordered quantities of the free field in the sense we shall explain now . to this avail we recall the form of the ( quantum ) @xmath33product and ( time  ordered ) @xmath43product in and which are defined by means of a hadamard distribution @xmath31 and its feynman",

    "up to renormalisation of the time  ordered product , these products computed for the special case of the functional @xmath79 give @xmath80 @xmath81    this example shows that the @xmath33product ( @xmath43product ) implements the wick theorem for normal  ordered ( time  ordered ) fields , and thus the previous formulae can be interpreted in more standard notation as @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 e.g. @xmath85 is a convenient way to encode the combinatorics of normal ordering whereby the exponential series terminates for polynomial functionals such as @xmath86 .    the wick theorem relates ( time  ordered ) products of wick ",
    "ordered quantities to sums of wick  ordered versions of contracted products , where the definition of `` wick  ordering '' and `` contraction '' are directly related , they both depend on the hadamard distribution @xmath31 chosen . thus ,",

    "the choice of @xmath31 is not important , indeed choosing a different @xmath87 with the same properties , one has that @xmath88 , because the advanced propagator @xmath52 is unique and thus universal . moreover , @xmath5 is real , smooth and symmetric and @xmath89 with @xmath90 defined as in and thus the algebras associated to @xmath33 , @xmath43 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are isomorphic via @xmath93 where we recall that @xmath54 is algebra @xmath33generated by @xmath43products of local functionals .",
    "hence , one may choose a suitable @xmath31 according to ones needs .",
    "however , since @xmath94 for functionals containing multiple field powers , statements like `` the potential is @xmath61 '' are ambiguous in paqft , and in fact also in the standard treatment of qft .",
    "they become non  ambiguous only if one says `` the potential is @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath61 wick  ordered with respect to @xmath31 '' . in paqft",
    "the corresponding non  ambiguous statement would be `` the potential is the functional @xmath61 in the algebra @xmath54 constructed by means of @xmath31 '' .",
    "if one then passes to the algebra @xmath96 constructed by means of @xmath97 , the potential picks up quadratic and c  number terms as we shall compute explicitly below .",
    "alternatively , this ambiguity may be seen to correspond to the renormalisation ambiguity of tadpoles in feynman diagrams .    given a gaussian and hadamard free field state @xmath75 ,",
    "a convenient choice or representation of the algebra is to take @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the two - point function of the free field in the state @xmath75 .",
    "this corresponds to standard normal  ordering and consequently in this representation the expectation values of all expressions which contain non - trivial powers of the field vanish , i.e. @xmath100 keeping the state @xmath75 fixed , but passing on to a representation of the algebra with arbitrary @xmath31 , the expectation value is computed as @xmath101 for instance @xmath102 which in more standard terms would be computed as @xmath103    in qft in curved spacetimes normal  ordering is in principle problematic , because ( pointlike ) observables should be defined in a local and generally covariant way , i.e. they should only depend on the spacetime in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the observable localisation @xcite .",
    "this is not satisfied for e.g. field polynomials wick  ordered with @xmath104 , because this distribution satisfies the klein - gordon equation and thus it encodes non  local information on the curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is still possible to compute in the convenient normal  ordered representation in the following way . in the example of @xmath61theory",
    ", one defines the potential @xmath105 as a local and covariant observable by identifying it with the corresponding monomial in a representation of the algebra furnished by a purely geometric @xmath31 , i.e. a @xmath31 of the form with @xmath106 .",
    "in other words , we set once and for all in the @xmath31representation @xmath107 this does not fix @xmath55 uniquely , because @xmath108 depends on the scale @xmath41 inside of the logarithm , but the freedom in defining @xmath109 , and analogously the free / quadratic part of klein  gordon action , as above corresponds to the usual freedom in choosing the `` bare mass '' @xmath110 , `` bare coupling to the scalar curvature '' @xmath111 , `` bare cosmological constant '' @xmath112 , `` bare newton constant '' @xmath46 , as well as the `` bare coefficients '' @xmath113 , @xmath114 of higher  derivative gravitational terms in the extended einstein  hilbert  klein ",

    "<S> we develop a renormalisation scheme for time  ordered products in interacting field theories on curved spacetimes which consists of an analytic regularisation of feynman amplitudes and a minimal subtraction of the resulting pole parts . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is directly applicable to spacetimes with lorentzian signature , manifestly generally covariant , invariant under any spacetime isometries present and constructed to all orders in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the scheme captures correctly the non  geometric state  </S>",
    "<S> dependent contribution of feynman amplitudes and it is well  suited for practical computations . to illustrate this last point , we compute explicit examples on a generic curved spacetime , and demonstrate how momentum space computations in cosmological spacetimes can be performed in our scheme . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss only scalar fields in four spacetime dimensions , but we argue that the renormalisation scheme can be directly generalised to other spacetime dimensions and field theories with higher spin , as well as to theories with local gauge invariance . </S>"
