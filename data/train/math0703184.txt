    "<S> in this paper we characterize hyperbolic geometry among hilbert geometry by the property that three medians of any hyperbolic triangle all pass through one point .        </S>",
    "<S> we begin by recalling the hilbert geometry of an open convex set . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 be a nonempty bounded open convex set in @xmath1 the _ hilbert distance @xmath2 on @xmath0 is introduced by david hilbert as follows . for any @xmath3 let @xmath4 for distinct points @xmath5 in @xmath0 , assume the line passing through @xmath5 intersects the boundary @xmath6 at two points @xmath7 such that the order of these four points on the line is @xmath8 as in figure [ hilbert ] . </S>",
    "<S> _    hilbert distance ]    denote the cross - ratio of the points by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the euclidean norm of @xmath11 then the hilbert distance is @xmath12 the metric space @xmath13 is called a hilbert geometry . </S>",
    "<S> notice that a straight line in @xmath13 is a geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 is the unit open ball @xmath14 , @xmath13 is the klein model of the hyperbolic geometry .    since the cross - ratio is invariant under any projective mapping @xmath15 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 are isometric as hilbert geometry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when @xmath0 is an open ellipsoid ( ellipse when n=2 ) , @xmath17 for some nonzero numbers @xmath18 , @xmath13 is isometric to the hyperbolic geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is to characterize hyperbolic geometry among hilbert geometry . by the argument above , it is equivalent to characterize ellipsoid among open convex set . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors characterize ellipsoid by using the fact that every hyperbolic ideal triangle has a constant area . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will consider another elementary property . </S>",
    "<S> the following is a well - known fact in constant sectional curvature geometry ( see @xcite chapter 7 , especially problem k-19 ) :    three medians of any triangle all pass through one point .    that this property characterizes hyperbolic geometry among hilbert geometry was conjectured by feng luo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the affirmative solution of it .    </S>",
    "<S> [ 1 ] let @xmath0 be a nonempty bounded open convex set in @xmath19 with a hilbert distance @xmath2 . if three medians of any triangle in @xmath20 all pass through one point ( called property m ) , then @xmath0 is an open ellipsoid .    </S>",
    "<S> first we consider the case @xmath21 if @xmath0 is not an open ellipse , we try to find a triangle which dose not have the property m. we will use the following lemma which is a simplified version of a result due to fritz john @xcite , see also @xcite @xcite .    any nonempty bounded open convex set @xmath0 in @xmath22 contains a unique open ellipse @xmath23 with maximal euclidean area . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore @xmath24 contains at least three points .    </S>",
    "<S> continue the proof of theorem [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the ellipse @xmath23 in @xmath0 with maximal euclidean area . if the number of contact points of their boundary is 3 or 4 . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the ellipse @xmath23 a little bit to obtain another ellipse @xmath25 as in figure [ extend ] .    </S>",
    "<S> extend ellipse @xmath23 to @xmath25 ]    more precisely , assume @xmath23 is defined by @xmath27 we define ellipse @xmath25 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and sufficiently small . since @xmath23 is of maximal area , @xmath30 must intersect @xmath6 at 6 or 8 points </S>",
    "<S> .    therefore we always can find an ellipse , still denote it by @xmath23 , such that the number of points in @xmath31 is at least 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> since we assume @xmath0 is not an ellipse , there exists an open set @xmath32 now we choose a point @xmath33 and five points @xmath34 from @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we arrange the subindex such that the order of these five points on @xmath36 is @xmath37 and @xmath38 is between @xmath39 as in figure [ triangle ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that any three points do not lie on a straight line .    </S>",
    "<S> construction of triangle @xmath40    now join @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 by line segments , denoted by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> assume @xmath46 if the segment @xmath47 passes through @xmath48 , we can choose another point from @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we may assume @xmath47 avoids @xmath48 and @xmath50 , @xmath51    now we claim that the triangle @xmath52 in @xmath0 dose not have the property m. since @xmath52 is also in @xmath53 which is a hyperbolic geometry . </S>",
    "<S> under the distance @xmath54 , three medians of @xmath52 all pass through one point . </S>",
    "<S> we assume under the distance @xmath54 , points @xmath55 are middle points of edge @xmath56 respectively . by the construction of @xmath52 , we see under the distance @xmath2 the middle points of edge @xmath56 are @xmath57 now we only need to check @xmath58 which will finish the proof . since @xmath59 all pass through one point , @xmath60 can not all pass through one point .    </S>",
    "<S> now we extend @xmath47 such that it intersects @xmath61 at @xmath62 and @xmath6 at @xmath63 as in figure [ triangle ] . </S>",
    "<S> since the cross - ration is invariant under any projective mapping , consider a projection @xmath15 sending segment @xmath47 to the coordinate line @xmath64 such that @xmath65 as in figure [ projection ] .    </S>",
    "<S> projective mapping ]    notice @xmath66 furthermore @xmath67 ( respectively @xmath68 ) which is the middle point of @xmath69 with two end points @xmath70 ( respectively @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since @xmath72 we have @xmath73 we define the right hand side to be a function @xmath74 and @xmath75 since the derivative @xmath76 the function @xmath77 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath78 hence @xmath79 and @xmath80    for general case @xmath81 let us recall the following result , see @xcite ( pp . </S>",
    "<S> 91 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ 3 ] for a nonempty open convex set @xmath0 in @xmath19 , if for a fixed @xmath82 every @xmath83 dimensional plain through a fixed point @xmath84 intersects @xmath0 in an ellipsoid ( ellipse when r=2 ) , @xmath0 itself is an ellipsoid .    </S>",
    "<S> continue the proof of theorem [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if every triangle in @xmath0 has the property m , by case @xmath85 , the intersection of @xmath0 with any 2-plain is an ellipse . by the lemma [ 3 ] , </S>",
