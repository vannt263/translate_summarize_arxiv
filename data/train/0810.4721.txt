    "autowave vortices , or spiral waves in two - dimensions ( 2d ) , are types of self - organization observed in dissipative media of physical @xcite , chemical @xcite , and biological nature @xcite , where wave propagation is supported by a source of energy stored in the medium .",
    "the common feature of all these phenomena is that they can be mathematically described , with various degrees of accuracy , by reaction - diffusion partial differential equations , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a column - vector of the reagent concentrations , @xmath3 is a column - vector of the reaction rates , @xmath4 is the matrix of diffusion coefficients , and @xmath5 is the vector of coordinates on the plane .",
    "the existence of vortices is not due to singularities in the medium but is determined only by development from initial conditions .",
    "a rigidly rotating spiral wave solution to the system ( [ rds ] ) has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 are polar coordinates centered at @xmath8 , vector @xmath9 defines the center of rotation , and @xmath10 is the initial rotation phase . for a steady ,  rigidly rotating , spiral",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath10 are constants .",
    "the system of reference co - rotating with the spiral s initial phase and angular velocity @xmath11 around the spiral s center of rotation is called the system of reference of the spiral . in this system of reference , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the polar angle",
    "is given by @xmath14 . in this frame the spiral wave solution @xmath15 does not depend on time and satisfies the equation @xmath16 in this equation , the unknowns are the field @xmath15 and the scalar @xmath11 .",
    "a slightly perturbed steady spiral wave solution @xmath17 substituted in ( [ rds ] ) , at leading order in @xmath18 , yields the evolution equation for the perturbation @xmath19 , @xmath20 thus , the linear stability spectrum of a steady spiral @xmath21 is defined by the linearized operator @xmath22 the operator @xmath23 has critical ( @xmath24 ) eigenvalues @xmath25 which correspond to eigenfunctions related to equivariance of ( [ rds ] ) with respect to translations and rotations ,  `` goldstone modes '' ( gms ) @xcite @xmath26 the stability spectra of steady spiral waves was originally obtained numerically by barkley @xcite .",
    "subsequently the spectrum was analysed for infinite and large bounded domains by sandstede and scheel  @xcite with follow - on numerical investigations by wheeler and barkley @xcite confirming the large domain behavior of the stability spectrum .    in a slightly perturbed problem @xmath27 where @xmath28 is some small perturbation , spiral waves may drift , change rotational phase and/or center location . then , the center of rotation and the initial phase are no longer constants but become functions of time , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in linear approximation , assuming that @xmath31 the drifting spiral wave solution can be represented as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a small perturbation of the steady spiral wave solution @xmath34 .",
    "then , the solution perturbation @xmath19 in the laboratory frame of reference will satisfy the linearized system @xmath35 the solvalability condition for equation ( [ g_eqn ] ) for @xmath36 ,  fredholm alternative , re - written in the spiral frame of reference , requires that the free term must be orthogonal to the kernel of the adjoint operator to @xmath23 defined in ( [ l ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following system of equations for the drift velocities    @xmath37    thus , the drift velocities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are determined by the `` forces '' @xmath40 and @xmath41 which , after sliding averaging ( more specifically , central moving average ) over the spiral wave rotation period , can be expressed @xcite as @xmath42 ( of course , @xmath43 )",
    ". here @xmath44 stands for the scalar product in functional space , @xmath45 the kernels @xmath46 of convolution - type integrals in ( [ forces ] ) are the spiral wave s _ response functions _",
    "( rfs ) , , the critical eigenfunctions @xmath47 where @xmath48 of the adjoint linearized operator : @xmath49 chosen to be biorthogonal @xmath50 to the goldstone modes ( [ goldstone ] ) . note that the rfs do not depend on time ,  are functions of the coordinates only , in the co - rotating system of reference .",
    "the asymptotic theory just outlined reduces the description of the smooth dynamics of spiral waves from the system of nonlinear partial differential equations ( [ rds ] ) to the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ ptb ] ) , describing the movement of the core of the spiral and the shift of its angular velocity . several qualitative results in the asymptotic theory of spiral and scroll dynamics have been obtained without the use of response functions , .",
    "however , an explicit knowledge of rfs makes possible a quantitative description , which obviously can be much more efficient for the understanding and control of spiral wave dynamics in numerous applications ,  control of re - entry in the heart .",
    "the asymptotic properties of the rfs at large distances are crucial for convergence of the convolution integrals in ( [ forces ] ) .",
    "an early version of the asymptotic theory , developed by keener  @xcite for scroll wave dynamics , considered the rfs asymptotically periodic in the limit @xmath51 , in much the same way as spiral waves are , thus requiring an artifical cut - off procedure to tackle the divergence of the integrals in ( [ forces ] ) following from such an asumption .",
    "based on observations and empirical data of spiral wave dynamics , biktashev  @xcite conjectured that the response functions quickly decay at large @xmath52 ,  are effectively localized .",
    "this conjecture implies that the integrals in ( [ forces ] ) converge and no cut - off procedure is required .    to prove existence of the localized responce functions , biktasheva  @xcite explicitly computed them in the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) for a particular set of parameters .",
    "those computations exploited an additional symmetry present in the cgle , which permitted the reduction of the 2d problem to the computation of 1d components .",
    "the computations were verified by numerical convergence of the method with respect to the space discretisation and the size of the medium . following this work ,",
    "the computed rfs were successfully used for quantitative prediction of the spiral s resonant drift and drift due to media inhomogeneity  @xcite . by explicitly computing the rfs in the cgle for a broad range of the model s parameters , biktasheva and biktashev  @xcite showed that the rfs are localized for stable spiral wave solutions and qualitatively change at crossing the charachteristic lines in the model parameter plane .",
    "recently , there has been a significant theoretical progress in mathematical treatment of the localization of the response functions .",
    "sandstede and scheel  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.6 ) analytically proved such localization for one - dimensional wave dislocations , which may be considered as analogues of a spiral wave in one spatial dimension .",
    "hopefully this can be extended to two spatial dimensions ,  to spiral waves .    for cardiac applications , dynamics of spiral waves in",
    "_ excitable _ media is more important than in _ oscillatory _ media such as the cgle , as most cardiac tissues are excitable .",
    "these models do not allow reduction to 1d , making quantitatively accurate computation of the response functions more challenging .",
    "so far , the response functions have been computed in the barkley @xcite and fitzhugh - nagumo @xcite models of excitable media .",
    "for the chosen sets of model parameters , the computed rfs appeared effectively localized in the vicinity of the spiral wave core .",
    "hamm  @xcite and biktasheva  @xcite calculated rfs on cartesian grids , but the accuracy was not sufficient for quantitative prediction of drift .",
    "hakim and henry  @xcite took the advantage of a polar grid and barkley model to compute the spiral wave solution with an accuracy of @xmath53 and rfs with accuracy @xmath54 ( both in the sense of @xmath55-norm of the residue of the discretized equations ) leading to quantitative prediction of drift velocities with about 4% accuracy . encouraging as these results are",
    ", there is a need for a more computationally efficient , accurate and robust method to compute the response functions of spiral waves in a variety of excitable media with required accuracy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a method which is superior to previous methods used to compute response functions and to demonstrate that it works for stationary rotating spirals in fitzhugh - nagumo system .",
    "we also demonstrate convergence of the method with respect to the computational parameters ,  discretization steps and size of the medium , and show that the method is vastly more efficient than the methods used before  @xcite .",
    "to compute the response functions , we use methods similar to those described in @xcite .    the nonlinear problem ( [ sw - own ] ) is considered on a disk @xmath56 , with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions , @xmath57 .",
    "the fields are discretized on a regular polar grid @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 plus the center point @xmath61 .",
    "hence there are @xmath62 grid points and correspondingly @xmath63 unknowns and the same number of equations in the discretization of ( [ sw - own ] ) . for the inner points",
    "@xmath64 , the @xmath52-derivatives are calculated via second - order central differences .",
    "the @xmath65-derivatives are calculated using fornberg s weights.f subroutine @xcite which uses all @xmath66 values so , in theory , provides an approximation of @xmath65-derivatives of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "the discretization of the laplacian at the center point is via the difference between the average around the innermost circle @xmath67 and the center point , and the approximation at @xmath68 takes into account the boundary conditions at @xmath69 .",
    "the discretized nonlinear steady - state spiral problem ( [ sw - own ] ) is solved by newton s method , starting from initial approximations obtained by interpolation of results of simulations of the time - dependent problem ( [ rds ] ) using ezspiral .",
    "the newton iterations involve inversion of the linearized matrix which has a banded structure with the bandwidth @xmath70 .",
    "this is achieved by the appropriate ordering of the unknowns of the discretized problem within the @xmath71-dimensional vector of unknowns , so that the index enumerating components of reagent vectors from @xmath72 varied fastest , followed by the index enumerating angular grid points @xmath73 , followed by the index enumerating the radial grid points @xmath74 .",
    "the thus posed discretized nonlinear problem inherits the symmetry of ( [ sw - own ] ) with respect to rotations . to select a unique solution out of a family of solutions generated by this symmetry",
    ", we impose a `` pinning condition '' of the form @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 may be selected arbitrarily and @xmath79 is chosen as the @xmath65-grid point in the @xmath80 circle that gives the @xmath76-component value closest to @xmath77 in the initial approximation . since @xmath81 is fixed , it is no longer an unknown , and its place in the @xmath82-vector of unknowns is taken by @xmath11 , also to be found from ( [ sw - own ] ) . in this way , the balance of the unknowns and equations is preserved . as @xmath11 is present in all equations ,",
    "the corresponding non - zero column of the linearization matrix destroys the bandedness of the matrix .",
    "this obstacle is overcome by employing the sherman - morrison formula @xcite to find solutions of the corresponding linear systems using only banded matrices .",
    "newton iterations are performed until the residual in solution of the discretized version of equation ( [ sw - own ] ) becomes sufficiently small .",
    "the linearized problems ( [ right - evp ] ) and ( [ left - evp ] ) are considered in the same domain with similar boundary conditions .",
    "the critical eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the discretized operators @xmath23 and @xmath83 are computed with the help of a complex shift and cayley transform .    for a matrix @xmath84 , be it discretization of @xmath23 or @xmath83 , the complex shift is defined as @xmath85 and the subsequent cayley transform as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are real parameters and @xmath90 is the identity matrix . if @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are eigenvalues of @xmath84 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , this implies @xmath96 the selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the thus constructed matrices @xmath95",
    "are then found by the arnoldi method , using arpack  @xcite .",
    "we have used @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 when seeking , respectively , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath11 is the solution of the corresponding nonlinear problem previously obtained . with this choice of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 , the numerical eigenvalues @xmath102 and @xmath103 closest to the theoretical critical eigenvalues ( [ lambdas ] ) and ( [ mus ] ) correspondingly , generate the largest @xmath104 .",
    "hence , the arnoldi method in each case is required to obtain the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value .    to normalize the eigenvectors",
    ", we use the `` analytical '' goldstone modes @xmath105 , obtained by numerical differentiation of the numerical spiral wave solution @xmath106 , namely , @xmath107 where differentiation has been implemented using the same discretization schemes as used in calculations .",
    "first , the response functions @xmath108 computed by arpack are normalized with respect to the `` analytical '' goldstone modes @xmath105 so that @xmath109 where numerical integration involved in @xmath44 has been carried out using the trapezoidal rule .    then , the `` numerical '' goldstone modes @xmath110 computed by arpack are normalized with respect to the normalized response functions so that @xmath111    thus , we finally obtain    * a numerical solution for the spiral wave problem ( [ sw - own ] ) together with the angular velocity @xmath11 , * `` analytical '' goldstone modes @xmath105 , * normalized `` numerical '' goldstone modes @xmath110 , and * normalized response functions @xmath108 .",
    "to validate the computed response functions , we have to demonstrate convergence of the solution with respect to the numerical approximation parameters such as the size of the medium @xmath112 , and the discretization steps @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "first of all , we have to demonstrate convergence of the computed eigenvalues of @xmath115 and @xmath116 to their theoretical values ( [ lambdas ] ) and ( [ mus ] ) , taking for @xmath11 its numerical approximation @xmath117 found by numerical solving the discretized problem ( [ sw - own ] ) . since the `` theoretical '' value for @xmath11 is not available , we can only check convergence of @xmath117 to some limit .",
    "the accuracy of the `` numerical '' goldstone modes is quantified by the distance between the `` numerical '' and `` analytical '' goldstone modes , in @xmath118 norm @xmath119 as well as @xmath120 norm @xmath121 over a disk @xmath122 of half the radius of the computational domain : @xmath123 the smaller disk is used to exclude the effects of boundary conditions .",
    "the issue is that the exact gm @xmath124 do not satisfy neumann boundary conditions whereas @xmath125 do , hence there is an inevitable deviation between them near @xmath69 , which is an artefact of restricting our problem to a finite domain , and is not indicative of the accuracy of the computed @xmath126 , which are expected to be exponentially small near @xmath69 .",
    "the accuracy of the computed response functions @xmath126 could be tested directly in the same way as the accuracy of the computed @xmath117 ,  by the numerical convergence to some limit .",
    "this is however , difficult to implement for the numerical solutions obtained on different grids .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to examine the convergence in @xmath113 where coarser grids are subgrids of the finer grids by restricting the fine - grid solutions to the coarse grid , without the need for any interpolation .",
    "specifically , we calculate @xmath127 and @xmath128 over the whole computational domain @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the numerical response functions calculated at the radius step @xmath113 which is an integer multiple of the minimal radius step @xmath131 , and the finest numerical response functions @xmath132 have been restricted to the coarser grid of @xmath130 of the solution to which they are compared , so the numerical integration is done over the coarser grid .",
    "note that in the series with varying @xmath112 and fixed @xmath114 and @xmath113 , the coarser grids are also subgrids of the finer grids , but as the pinning point is defined via @xmath112 , solutions at different @xmath112 are again not directly comparable to each other so this series is not used in this comparison .",
    "we also assess accuracy indirectly via the bi - orthogonality between the response functions and the goldstone modes required by ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "specifically , we examine the orthogonality of the rfs to the `` analytical '' gms , quantified by @xmath133 and orthogonality of the rfs to the `` numerical '' gms quantified by @xmath134 note , that by construction the diagonal elements of both the `` numerical '' and `` analytical '' bi - orthogonality matrices here are all equal to 1 up to round - off errors .",
    "the measures @xmath135 and @xmath136 require some discussion .",
    "the bi - orthogonality should be exact for exact rfs and gms .",
    "however , what we calculate are approximations of these functions , subject to discretization in @xmath52 and @xmath65 and restriction to a finite domain @xmath56 .",
    "the bi - orthogonality of numerical solutions is therefore not exact and its deviation from the ideal is an indication of the accuracy of calculation , and its convergence in @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath112 is an indication , albeit indirect , of the accuracy of the solutions .    in more detail , if the the matrices representing discretization of @xmath23 and @xmath83 were transposes of one another , then their eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues would be exactly orthogonal in @xmath55 , and so a measure of their orthogonality would not depend on the spatial discretization but only on the accuracy of the calculation of the eigenvectors by arpack .",
    "however , @xmath23 and @xmath83 are conjugate with respect to the scalar product which is approximated by a discrete inner product with a weight , hence the matrices of @xmath23 and @xmath83 are not transposed . moreover , because of the approximation used for these operators (  high - order approximation in @xmath114 vs second - order approximation in @xmath113 ) , the corresponding matrices are not adjoint of each other with respect to the weighted @xmath55 either .",
    "so , @xmath136 provides a measure of the consistency of these matrix representations together with the accuracy with which the eigenvectors are computed with arpack .",
    "moreover , apart from the question of accuracy of finding the eigenvectors of the discretized operators and accuracy of finding the eigenfunctions of the original continuous operators , there remains a question of whether the found eigenvectors and eigenfunctions are the ones that we need , that correspond to @xmath137 and @xmath138 , rather than eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues which happened to be close to @xmath137 and @xmath138  .",
    "for the gms , the answer to this question is ensured by checking the distance @xmath139 ; however , this answer is not absolute as the comparison is made only over part of the disk , for reasons discussed above .",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath83 eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalues close to but different from @xmath140 , are orthogonal to the gms and for them @xmath135 would be not small  ) gives @xmath141 if all nine scalar products vanish ; however in reality the scalar products of respective gms and rfs are used for normalization , so in the case of wrong rfs , all scalar products would be divided by small numbers which may result in rather large values of @xmath135 . ] . since @xmath135 is defined in terms of scalar products with the mode determined directly from the underlying spiral wave , its smallness provides the additional assurance that the adjoint eigenfunctions are indeed the rfs that we are after , not just some adjoint eigenfunctions .",
    "we have tested our method for computing the response functions in the case of the fitzhugh - nagumo model , @xmath142 , @xmath143 @xmath144}$ ] , with parameters @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 . for pinning ,",
    "we have used @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "newton iterations have been performed until the euclidean ( @xmath55 ) norm of the residual in the discretized nonlinear equation falls below @xmath53 . for comparison",
    ", we have also run cases , discussed later in fig .",
    "[ comp ] , in which iterations continue until the norm of the residual no longer decreases ( typically such norms were below @xmath151 down to @xmath152 ) . the tolerance in arpack",
    "s routines znaupd and zneupd has been set to the default `` machine epsilon '' . for the krylov subspace dimensionality we have tried 3 and 10 , with no perceptible difference in either the numerical results .                before discussing the performance of our numerical techniques , we briefly present typical solutions .",
    "figures  [ gmpics ] and [ rfpics ] illustrate the spiral wave solution and the gms and rfs for @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "this solution is taken as the best achievable given memory restrictions ( 4 gb of real memory ) . the angular velocity for it was found to be @xmath156 .",
    "for the gms and rfs , we show the @xmath157 and @xmath158 modes only , since the calculated @xmath159 modes are almost exactly the complex conjugates of the @xmath158 modes , which of course they should be .",
    "one can see that the gms @xmath125 are indeed proportional to corresponding derivatives of the spiral wave solution @xmath106 , and that the rfs @xmath126 are localized in a small region of the spiral tip and are indistinguishable from zero outside that region .",
    "the character of the rfs decay with distance is illustrated in more detail in fig .",
    "[ decay ] .",
    "we plot the angle - averaged values of the solutions , defined as @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "note the difference in the behavior of @xmath163 and @xmath164 on one hand and @xmath165 on the other hand . in the semilogarithmic ( linear for horizontal axis , logarithmic for vertical axis )",
    "coordinates of fig .",
    "[ decay](c ) the graphs of @xmath166 are straight for a large range of @xmath52 , not too close to 0 or @xmath153 , and for several decades of magnitude of @xmath165 .",
    "this shows clearly the expected exponential localization of the rfs . for comparison",
    ", we also show convergence of @xmath167 in a disk as a function of the disk radius @xmath112 .",
    "theory @xcite predicts that the @xmath166 and @xmath168 dependencies should both be decaying exponentials with the same characteristic exponent ; this agrees well with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ decay](c ) .",
    "sandstede and scheel  @xcite have computed exponential decay / increase rates of eigenfunctions of periodic wavetrains in one spatial dimension .",
    "a similar technique should , in principle , also work for the adjoint eigenfunctions .",
    "knowning the asymptotic wavelength of the spiral wave , this can be used to predict the exponential decay rates of the rfs of spiral waves . as can be seen from the results of wheeler and barkley  @xcite , although such correspondence between 1d and 2d calculations can be established , the accuracy of decay rate estimates for two - dimensional eigenfunctions achieved in this way is insufficient for a meaningful estimate of the accuracy of those eigenfunctions .",
    "we now turn to the main results of our study .",
    "convergence of the method has been tested by changing one of the three numerical approximation parameters @xmath112 , @xmath169 and @xmath66 while keeping the other two at the fixed values set by the `` best example '' . more specifically , while changing @xmath112 , we consider two variants : one with fixed @xmath66 , and one with changing @xmath66 so that the combination @xmath170 , which is the size of the outermost computational cells in the angular direction , remains constant .    fig .  [ convergence ] illustrates the results of the study , where the four columns correspond to different series of calculations , and the three rows correspond to the three different methods of assessing the accuracy : closeness of the eigenvalues to the theoretical values , distance between `` numerical '' and `` analytical '' gms and orthogonality between non - dual rfs and gms .",
    "the scales of @xmath171 , @xmath114 and the error estimates are logarithmic , and the scales of @xmath112 are linear . here shown",
    "is the distance between the `` numerical '' and `` analytical '' goldstone modes in @xmath118 norm , the distance in @xmath120 norm looks similar .    a typical feature on many of the curves is a `` knee''-shape , when the measure of the error decreases as @xmath112 grows or @xmath114 or @xmath171 decrease , but only until a certain point , beyond which it reaches a plateau .",
    "this behavior is expected and explicable .",
    "the calculation error is affected by many factors , and if the factor varied in a particular series becomes negligible , then the error remains at a constant level determined by fixed values of other factors .",
    "the position of the `` knees '' on the curves indicates that the accuracy of the rotational ( @xmath157 ) modes would be improved if @xmath114 were further decreased ( there are no knees on the curves corresponding to the rotational modes , red online , in the fourth ,  rightmost column ) , whereas the limiting parameter for the translational ( @xmath158 ) modes is @xmath113 ( there are no knees on the curves corresponding to the tanslational modes , blue online , in the third column ) .",
    "the analysis of the first two columns is more complicated .",
    "the errors estimates at the maximal @xmath112 are similar in both columns as they correspond to the same `` best '' spiral .",
    "these limit values are achieved ,  plateaux are observed , at much smaller @xmath112 values if @xmath172 , than if @xmath173 .",
    "this is because reduction of @xmath112 at fixed @xmath114 produces an additional improvement of approximation due to the angular discretization .",
    "when @xmath170 is kept fixed , as in the first column , the dependence of the solution on the disk radius is without this extra benefit .",
    "the rates of convergence with respect to parameters can be assessed by the slopes of the curves above the knees before they plateau . in some cases",
    "the data is somewhat irregular , primarily at parameters corresponding to lower values of error estimates .",
    "this is not unexpected and we attribute it to incomplete convergence of the iterative procedures ( see below ) . on the whole",
    ", the slopes can be determined clearly from these plots .    the constant slope in the first ( leftmost ) and",
    "the second columns corresponds to the exponential convergence with @xmath112 .",
    "the constant slope in the third column corresponds to power - law convergence , and the typical slope is 2 .",
    "this is well seen on the curves for translational modes , blue online , and not well on the curves for rotational modes , red online , which are very small anyway .",
    "slope 2 in the third column is to be expected as our discretization is second - order in @xmath113 in all cases .",
    "the curves in the fourth ( rightmost ) column are convex , which is consistent with the fact that the order of approximation is @xmath66 , which varies along the curve as @xmath114 varies , since @xmath174 , so the slope is bigger for smaller @xmath114 . in other words ,",
    "the high order of the fornberg approximation of the @xmath65 derivatives implies the convergence in @xmath114 is faster than any fixed power .        the irregular shape of some of the curves in fig .  [ convergence ] at very low values of the error estimates",
    "is related to the accuracy of finding the spiral solution and is ulitmately affected by the precision of floating point computations .",
    "note that all calculations in fig .",
    "[ convergence ] have been performed with a tolerance of @xmath53 for newton iterations of the spiral wave and some of the curves fall as low as @xmath175  close to machine epsilon .",
    "a change in the tolerance of the newton iteration reduces irregularities in the curves at low values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ comp](a , b ) .    finally , fig .",
    "[ comp](c ) illustrates convergence of numerical rfs @xmath176 as @xmath177 , calculated as the @xmath118-distance @xmath178 between the solutions at a given resultion @xmath113 and the `` best '' solution calculated at the smallest @xmath179 . as explained in the sec .",
    "[ sec : anal ] , this comparsion has been restricted to the series of calculations with varying @xmath113 , where grids at lower resolutions were subgrids of those with higher resolutions .",
    "the graphs of @xmath120 distances @xmath180 looked similar and are not shown here .",
    "the main result of this paper is a general , robust method for obtaining response functions for rigidly rotating spiral waves in excitable media with required accuracy .",
    "we have tested the method on the fitzhugh - nagumo model and we have studied the convergence of spiral wave solutions and eigenfunctions , both the goldstone modes and the response functions , with respect to the numerical approximation parameters @xmath112 , @xmath169 and @xmath66 . the rates of convergence are found to agree with the order of approximation and indicate the accuracy with which solutions can be found for particular numerical parameters .",
    "the slowest ( second - order ) convergence is , as expected , in the parameter @xmath169 .",
    "thus in a typical situation , an improvement of accuracy requires , other things being equal , an increase of @xmath169 , with associated increase in memory and time demands .",
    "thus , the most promising avenue of further development of the method is via increase of the approximation order of the radial derivatives .",
    "this is , of course , subject to usual caveat that the degree of approximation should be consistent with the actual smoothness of the solutions .",
    "the method used here to solve the eigenvalue problems for operators @xmath84 relies on successive application of transformations of @xmath84 applied to a sequence of vectors , alternating with gram - schmidt orthogonalization .",
    "these are typical ideas , also used in @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in @xcite , the linear transformations were polynomial functions of @xmath84 whereas we use rational functions of @xmath84 .",
    "the polynomial iterations used in @xcite were in fact equivalent to solving a cauchy problem for equation @xmath181 by the explicit euler method .",
    "therefore , those methods require a large number of iterations , and convergence speed of the iterations depends on the smallness of the absolute difference of the real parts of the eigenvalues of interest compared to those of other eigenvalues .",
    "one requires at least @xmath182 and typically @xmath183 sparse matrix - vector multiplications to achieve the desired solutions to the eigenvalue problem using such an approach .",
    "in contrast , with the complex shift and inversion of @xmath84 used in this paper , the convergence speed of the iterations depends on the smallness of the distance of the eigenvalues from their theoretical values used in the complex shift , compared to the distance to other eigenvalues .",
    "hence the number of iterations required is very small , typically @xmath184 .",
    "more specifically , with krylov subspace dimensionality 3 , the number of matrix multiplications with matrix @xmath95 of ( [ mxb ] ) did not exceed 7 per one eigenpair ; with krylov subspace dimensionality 10 , this number rose to 10 .",
    "the price to pay for this acceleration is the necessity to solve large systems of linear equations .",
    "however , the key observation is that since the linear system is fixed , it needs to be factorized only once , for a given complex shift , and used for all iterations .",
    "multiplication by matrix @xmath95 is achieved with only inexpensive back / forward solves . moreover , due to the way we ordered the unknowns in the discretized problem , the sparcity of matrix @xmath95 does not depend on the order of approximation of @xmath65-derivatives .",
    "hence , we are able to employ high - order approximations requiring far fewer points in the @xmath65 direction for the same accuracy as the second - order finite difference discretization used in @xcite , thereby further improving the efficiency of our method .    discounting the factorization step , each iteration , which involves multiplication by @xmath95 , is comparable to multiplications by @xmath84 . in practice",
    "we find that the factorization itself does not require more than the equivalent of four to six actions of @xmath95 . on a macpro with 3ghz intel processor ,",
    "the factorization step takes  about 7.5sec for the grid @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and 0.67sec for the grid @xmath185 , @xmath186 ; the computation times per @xmath95-multiplication were 1.23  sec and 0.17sec respectively .",
    "the comparison of our present method with @xcite is unequivocal : matrix inverses were not used there , and it was admitted already in @xcite that the resulting accuracy of solutions was severely limited . while direct accuracy and timing comparisons with @xcite would be most convincing , that code is not publicly available .",
    "however , for reasons already noted , on any given polar grid , the method we report is more accurate due to the angular discretization and considerably faster in floating - point operations .",
    "the computed response functions are localized in the vicinity of the spiral wave tip and exponentially decay with distance from it .",
    "this localization ensures convergence of the convolution integral in ( [ forces ] ) in an unbounded domain .",
    "the eigenvectors of the linearized operator ,  goldstone modes and of its adjoint ,  the response functions have been computed using the same technique , so the qualitatively different behavior of these solutions at large @xmath52 is not a numerical artefact , as it was not in any way assumed in the numerical method .",
    "although the method has been used here to compute the response functions in the fitzhugh - nagumo model , none of the details of the method depends on any specifics of the particular reaction kinetics and should be widely applicable to the computation of response functions of rigidly rotating waves in any other model of excitable tissue , as long as its right - hand sides are continuously differentiable so the linarized theory is applicable . moreover , the method can also be extended in a straightforward way to include additional effects , such as the effect of uniform twist along scroll waves with linear filaments in three dimensions  @xcite .",
