    "many technological , biological and social networks are intrinsically weighted . each link has associated an additional variable , called weight , which gauges the intensity or traffic of that connection , and that can exhibit widely varying fluctuations @xcite . the presence of weights is extremely relevant in some scenarios ( e.g. in the case of transport in a network in which weights measure bandwidth or capacity ) , and it must therefore be taken into account explicitly .",
    "some results have already been produced in this direction , dealing , among other problems , with diffusive processes @xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite , general equilibrium and non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite , or glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "here we present a detailed investigation of the ordering dynamics of voter - like models on weighted networks @xcite .",
    "the voter model  @xcite and the moran process  @xcite are simple examples of ordering dynamics , which allow to understand how natural systems with an initial disordered configuration are able to achieve order via local pairwise interactions .",
    "both models are described in terms of a collection of individuals , each endowed with a binary variable @xmath3 , taking the values @xmath4 .",
    "the elementary step consists in randomly choosing a first individual and then ( again randomly ) one of her nearest neighbors . in the voter model",
    "the first individual will _ copy _ the state of her neighbor . in the moran process , on the other hand , she will _ transmit _ her own state to the neighboring node , which will adopt it . in both cases ,",
    "starting from a disordered initial state , the iteration of the elementary step leads to the growth of correlated domains and , in finite systems , to an absorbing uniform state in which all individuals share the same state ( the so - called consensus ) . in a social science context",
    ", the voter model represents thus the simplest model of opinion formation in a population , in which individuals can change their opinion as a function of the state of their nearest neighbors @xcite . in the same way , in a biological context",
    ", the moran process represents the elementary example of two species competing ( through reproduction and neutral selection ) for the same environment @xcite .",
    "the voter and moran processes are equivalent on regular lattices and on the complete graph , but if the pattern of connections is given by a complex ( unweighted ) topology they behave differently , since the order in which interacting individuals are selected becomes relevant  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the time to reach consensus scales with the system size in different ways depending on the degree distribution of the network  @xcite .",
    "considering a weighted topological substrate adds , as we will see , a richer and more complex phenomenology . additionally , the case of weighted networks allows to model very natural settings . in the context of social sciences , for example",
    ", weights can reflect the obvious fact that the opinion of a given individual can be more easily influenced by a close friend rather than by a casual acquaintance . on the other hand , in an evolutionary scenario , weights allow to gauge the effects of heterogeneous replacement rates in different species .    on weighted networks , at each time step a vertex @xmath5",
    "is selected randomly with uniform probability ; then one nearest neighbor of @xmath5 , namely @xmath6 , is chosen with a probability proportional to the weight @xmath7 of the edge joining @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the probability of choosing the neighbor @xmath6 is @xmath8 vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are then updated according to the rules of the respective models . with this definition ,",
    "the models considered represent the natural extension for ordering dynamics on weighted networks ( and in particular of the voter model ) of the generalized moran process proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which dynamics was defined as a function of a set of arbitrary interaction probabilities @xmath9 . in our case , however , the fact that these interaction probabilities arise from the normalized weights arriving at a vertex imposes some restrictions to the possible values of @xmath9 and yields therefore different outcomes and interpretations .",
    "also , it is worth noting three recent publications @xcite , dealing with related , but not identical , models .    adopting the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) approximation @xcite we will assume that the weight between vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 depends only on the degrees at the edges endpoints , namely @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and therefore we can write @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the adjacency matrix and @xmath14 is a positive definite , symmetric function . the application of hmf theory and the backwards fokker - planck formalism  @xcite , allows us to derive analytical expressions in degree uncorrelated networks for the main relevant quantities ( namely , exit probability and consensus time @xcite ) in a more transparent way than in refs .",
    "in order to allow for closed mathematical solutions of the models , we will further specify the function @xmath15 to be given by the product of two independent functions @xmath16 , an assumption motivated by empirical observations in real weighted networks  @xcite . specializing both models to the case of networks with power - law distributed degrees and edge weights given by multiplicative powers the endpoint degrees , @xmath17 ,",
    "a very rich phase - diagram is obtained , with several different scaling regions of the consensus time with the network size @xmath18 .",
    "a numerical check of the analytical predictions reveals a good agreement in some regions of the parameters space and noticeable discrepancies in others . in order to gain insights into the observed numerical disagreement",
    ", we apply an improved mean - field approach , the heterogeneous pair approximation  @xcite , which turns out to provide better agreement with numerics for small @xmath0 but is still not able to solve the problems for large @xmath0 . the qualitatively different nature of the dynamics for large @xmath0 is briefly discussed and its understanding identified as an intriguing challenge for future work .",
    "in this section , we perform a theoretical analysis of the voter and moran processes on weighted networks within a hmf approximation @xcite , extending the fokker - planck formalism developed for the unweighted case in refs .",
    "let us consider the models defined by the interaction probability eq .",

    "this function can be expressed , within the annealed weighted network approximation , in terms of the density @xmath28 of @xmath29 spins in vertices of degree @xmath21 , taking the form @xmath30 for the voter model .",
    "the origin of these probabilities is easy to understand @xcite .",

    "analogously , the flipping probabilities for the moran process can be expressed as @xmath34    let us now present separately the mean - field analysis for the two models under consideration .",

    "some comments are now in order .",
    "first we notice that all relevant quantities are in fact function of the combination @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath111 both voter and moran dynamics are predicted to give the same results at the mean - field level , independently of the degree distribution .",
    "in fact , @xmath112 implies that both interacting vertices are extracted completely at random ( independently of their degree ) so that the asymmetry distinguishing the voter model from the moran process vanishes .",
    "for other values of @xmath0 , on the other hand , the effect of weights appears to be completely different for the two dynamics . for the voter model , positive values of @xmath0 tend to reduce the consensus time , while @xmath113 leads to increased @xmath106 , i.e. the dynamics becomes slower . in any case",
    "the consensus time is at most proportional to the system size @xmath18 : the dynamics is always relatively fast .",
    "interestingly , the hmf analysis predicts the presence of a region ( @xmath114 and @xmath104 ) for which the consensus time is constant , i.e. the dynamics undergoes an instantaneous ordering process , in contrast with what happens in other regions , in which ordered regions of opposite states can coexist for very long times , reaching consensus only in finite systems and through a large stochastic fluctuation @xcite .",
    "as it will be shown below , this is true only on annealed networks in which the quenched disorder imposed by the actual connections in the network is not considered .",
    "numerical simulations performed on quenched graphs give different results .",
    "for the moran process , on the other hand , @xmath115 represents a lower bound for the scaling of the consensus time : the dynamics is always rather slow , with an exponent larger than @xmath66 for all @xmath116 .",
    "remarkably , the scaling of @xmath106 turns out to depend symmetrically on @xmath117 : a large positive or a large negative value of @xmath118 are equally effective in slowing down the ordering process .",
    "in order to check the analytical predictions for the voter model and moran process , we have performed numerical simulations of both models on uncorrelated networks generated using the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm ) @xcite .",
    "the networks have a degree exponent @xmath1 , a minimum degree @xmath119 and a maximum degree smaller than or equal to @xmath120 , preventing the generation of correlations for @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "a weight strength @xmath121 is imposed by selecting a nearest neighbor @xmath6 of a vertex @xmath5 with probability @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the set of nearest neighbors of @xmath5 .    moreover , since hmf equations describe in an exact way dynamics taking place on annealed networks @xcite , we have simulated the voter model and the moran process also on such structures , in order to provide a benchmark of our analytical results . in annealed networks , in fact ,",
    "all links are rewired at each microscopic time step , so that no dynamical correlation can build up , and the absence of correlations assumed by mean - field approaches is actually implemented . in weighted networks , the probability that a vertex of degree @xmath21 interacts with a vertex of degree @xmath22 is given by @xmath124 where in the last equality we have assumed again that @xmath125",
    ". an annealed weighted network is thus implemented by choosing as neighbor of any given vertex another vertex of degree @xmath21 , randomly chosen in the network with probability proportional to @xmath126 @xcite . in a quenched network , on the other hand , the neighbors of the first node are of course fixed and the choice is restricted to them .      while for homogeneous initial conditions both the voter model and moran process lead to an exit probability equal to the standard voter model , i.e. @xmath127 , invasion initial conditions starting from a single @xmath29 spin in a vertex of degree @xmath21 lead to exit probabilities that depend explicitly on the initial degree considered .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath128 while for the voter model a single @xmath29 vertex has better chances to invade the system if it starts from a high degree vertex , for the moran process the situation is precisely the opposite , a single @xmath29 spin being favored when initially located in the vertices of smallest degree .",
    "this kind of behavior is actually to be expected from the very definition of the models , and has been already reported in unweighted networks @xcite .",
    "in fact , a high degree is beneficial in the voter model since it corresponds to a larger probability of being chosen as a partner by a neighbor in search for an opinion to copy , while in the moran process having many neighbors implies a larger probability to be invaded by the opinion at one of them . in fig .",

    "thus , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ t_hpa ] , for small values of @xmath0 ( @xmath182 and small @xmath1 , both hmf theory and the hpa provide accurate results for the consensus time .",
    "larger values of the weight exponent ( @xmath141 ) are well represented by hpa , while hmf fails .    for larger values of @xmath0 , however , even the hpa approximation is not sufficient to capture the correct behavior of the model . in this regime ,",
    "a much harsher breakdown of the hmf assumptions occurs  @xcite : the state of a node of degree @xmath21 ( or of an edge joining vertices of degree @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) depends not only on the degrees but on the detailed quenched structure of the network , much beyond single - node or single - pair features .",
    "for example , as @xmath183 @xcite each node interacts deterministically with its most connected neighbor . according to hmf equations , which describe an annealed scenario ,",
    "this means that every node will select the most connected node(s ) in the network .",
    "however , in a quenched structure each node can choose its partner only among its neighbors , with the result that different portions of the network will effectively become independent from the point of view of the dynamics .",
    "different regions of the network may therefore order in different states , and in this case the final global consensus will never be reached ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented a detailed investigation of the behavior of voter model and moran processes on weighted complex networks . from the analytical point of view",
    "we have put forward a theoretical framework that allows to deal with generic edge weights . for a specific form of the weights",
    "we have derived in detail all relevant properties of the dynamical processes , such as the exit probability and the scaling of the consensus time as a function of the network size .",
    "it turns out that the presence of weights has the effect of slowing down the moran process with respect to the unweighted case , while it generally speeds up ordering with voter dynamics .",
    "numerical simulations are in good agreement with the theory for small absolute values of @xmath0 , while for large @xmath2 substantial discrepancies show up . an improved mean - field - like theoretical approach ( heterogeneous pair approximation )",
    "taking into account two - body correlations gives better agreement with numerics .",
    "still in the limit of large positive ( negative ) @xmath0 , when the state of a node tends to be deterministically enslaved to the state of its neighbor with largest ( smallest ) degree , the theoretical approaches fail to describe in a satisfactory manner the behavior of the system .",
    "the positive news is that the mean - field equations describe quite well the dynamics observed in real ( quenched ) networks for weight intensities of the order of the ones observed in real - world networks @xcite .",
    "however , the generality of this finding , as well as the intrinsic limits of the theory , are in need of a better understanding ( see also @xcite ) . a theoretical approach able to take into account the detailed quenched structure of weighted networks is in order to successfully tackle this problem .",
