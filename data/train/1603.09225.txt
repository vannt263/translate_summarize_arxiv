    "protoplanetary disks are the birthplace of planets .",
    "recent observations have revealed protoplanetary disks having an inner cavity and strongly non - axisymmetric structures in the outer region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such protoplanetary disks , dust distribution is much more non - axisymmetric than gas distribution .",
    "it is often considered that the non - axisymmetric structures as observed are formed by a gas large - scale vortex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which captures large dust particles ( @xmath0  mm in size ) due to gas drag . when protoplanetary disks have a rapid radial variation , such as boundaries between magnetically active and non - active regions (  dead zones ",
    "; * ? ? ? * ) or edges of gaps induced by a giant planet @xcite , the gas large - scale vortex is formed",
    "the gas large - scale vortex can be formed by the rossby wave instability ( rwi ) , which is a non - axisymmetric hydrodynamic instability .",
    "the rwi was first studied with two - dimensional ( 2d ) linear stability analyses .",
    "these previous works show that protoplanetary disks with the rapid radial variation , such as a step jump up ( as figure [ fig1 ] ) and a bump ( as figure [ fig3 ] ) in the surface mass density profile , are unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations , and the growth rate of the rwi is of the order of dynamical timescale .",
    "a number of 2d non - linear hydrodynamic simulations are carried out and , in general , the results are consistent with linear stability analyses .",
    "the rwi in three - dimensional ( 3d ) disks has also been studied using both linear stability analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical simulations .",
    "it is indicated that , at least qualitatively , 2d calculations resemble 3d results . therefore , essential physics of the rwi may be captured within 2d frameworks . points out that the rwi is similar to the shear instability for incompressible flow in shallow water .",
    "it is also known that the rwi is , to some extent , similar to the drury - papaloizou - pringle instability @xcite .",
    "@xcite derives a condition for the rwi ( lovelace s condition ) , which reads that background flow should have at least one extremum in the vortensity profile .",
    "however , the sufficiency of the lovelace s condition against the rwi has not been investigated well .",
    "@xcite performs 2d linear stability analyses for both barotropic and non - barotropic flows , and calculates the growth rate for each azimuthal mode number . in this paper , we perform linear stability analyses for only barotropic flow with a similar method to @xcite , but using more various types of background flow on a wider parameter space .",
    "we derive newly the _ necessary and sufficient _",
    "condition for the onset of the rwi in semi - analytic form , which , we consider , can be used generally .",
    "we also discuss the physical nature of the rwi from results of the linear stability analyses .",
    "we show formulation in  2 and briefly review the known conditions associated with the rwi in  3 .",
    "the stability of the system against the rwi is given in  4 .",
    "we investigate marginally stable states to the rwi and derive a new condition for the rwi in  5 . in  6 , we discuss the physical nature of the rwi .",
    "conclusions of this work are summarized in  7 .",
    "we consider geometrically thin , non - magnetized and inviscid disks .",
    "this is because the essence of the rwi seems to be understood in the 2d and purely hydrodynamic regime .",
    "we use a cylindrical coordinate system with ( @xmath1 ) being in the disk plane and the origin at the central star .",
    "we assume that self - gravity of the disk is negligible .",
    "the gravitational potential of the central star is denoted by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the central star , and the disk surface mass density profile is given by @xmath4 .",
    "we denote ( vertically integrated ) pressure by @xmath5 and assume , for simplicity , that the disk gas is barotropic , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the effective adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the continuity equation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is time , @xmath12 is velocity field , @xmath13 is the unit vector in the @xmath14 direction and @xmath15 is the unit vector in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the two components ( @xmath1 ) of the equations of motion are @xmath17    from equations ( 1)-(3 ) , it is possible to obtain the equation of vortensity conservation with respect to fluid elements ; @xmath18 where @xmath19 is vortensity .    it should be noted that we have assumed , for simplicity , that the barycenter of the system always coincide with the central star , and is located at the origin .",
    "this means that the indirect term of the gravitational potential , which arises from the deviation of the barycenter of the system from the position of the central star , is negligible .",
    "the indirect term can have a significant effect on the disk morphology if the disk is massive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to consider low - mass disks .",
    "we expect that the essential physics of the rwi can be captured within our framework .      to perform linear perturbation analyses , we first need to define profiles of the background disks .",
    "we use the background profiles being stationary ( @xmath20 ) and axisymmetric ( @xmath21 ) , which denoted by subscript  0  , e.g. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 is background velocity field and @xmath25 is satisfied .",
    "we assume that the background profiles have radially smooth `` base '' profiles and rapid radial variations . as a `` base '' profile ,",
    "the surface mass density is given by a simple power - law profile with the index @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a representative radius and @xmath29 is the surface mass density of this base disk model at @xmath30 . as a form of @xmath31 , we consider four representative cases ,",

    "we call this the gaussian bump ( gb ) type .",
    "the gb type is intrinsically same as the  hgb  type in @xcite .",

    "we call this the gaussian gap ( gg ) type .",
    "since we consider barotropic flow , the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ( vertically integrated ) pressure of the base disk model at @xmath30 . since we consider the disk to be in vertically hydrostatic equilibrium in terms of the structure in the vertical ( @xmath46 ) direction , the scale height @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is background adiabatic sound speed and @xmath50 is background rotation angular velocity .",
