    "the idea that our world is a three brane embedded in a higher dimensional space - time with non - factorizable warped geometry has been much investigated since the appearance of papers @xcite .",
    "the first solution for a warped metric was provided in @xcite . in this paper",
    "it was suggested that gravitational interactions between particles on a brane in uncompactified five - dimensional space could have the correct four - dimensional newtonian behavior , provided that the bulk cosmological constant is fine - tuned to the brane tension .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite the warped metrics could provide an alternative to compactification of extra dimension used for a possible explanation of the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "brane solution described in @xcite has the form @xmath0 where the parameter @xmath1 is determined by the bulk cosmological and five - dimensional gravitational constants respectively .",
    "an important issue in the study of braneworld models is the localization of standard model fields on the brane .",
    "this problem for the brane ( [ grs ] ) was addressed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the massless scalar field has a zero mode normalizable with the weight @xmath2 .",
    "when this field is given mass the bound state becomes metastable against tunneling into an extra dimension @xcite .",
    "fermion fields are not localized on the positive tension brane by gravitational interactions @xcite . in order to localize fermions",
    "one can use the method of localization described in paper @xcite .",
    "but the adding of bulk mass term makes the fermion bound state unstable as well trough the barrier penetration into an extra dimension @xcite .",
    "based on this phenomenon the possibility of decaying cold dark matter into an extra space was considered in the framework of braneworld cosmology , see @xcite .",
    "the comoving density of cold dark matter was taken to decay over time with a rate @xmath3 corresponding to the exponential decay of a metastable state .",
    "but in quantum mechanics it is well established that an exponential decay can not last forever if the hamiltonian is bounded below and can not occur for small times if , besides that , the energy expectation value of the initial state is finite @xcite . from this point of view",
    "we consider the dynamics of massive matter disappearance on the brane .",
    "due to four - dimensional poincare invariance of the metric ( [ grs ] ) every fields in this background can be decomposed into four - dimensional plane waves    @xmath4    where coordinate four momentum @xmath5 coincides with the physical momentum on the brane .",
    "it is natural to assume that the three momentum @xmath6 does not change the picture of tunneling into an extra dimension . for the sake of simplicity we put @xmath7 in what follows . under this assumption",
    "the equation    @xmath8    gives    @xmath9    where @xmath10 .",

    "we take the following condition @xmath22 corresponding to the free particle on the brane ( [ plwde ] ) with energy @xmath23 .",

    "the probability of the particle to remain on the brain at instant @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the brane localized initial state and the scalar product is understood with the measure @xmath2 @xmath29 from eq.([eveq ] ) one finds @xmath30~,\\ ] ] @xmath31~,\\ ] ] where @xmath32        in the above @xmath33 is real variable , but in the following it is understood that @xmath33 can be complex . the function @xmath34 has the simple poles determined by the equation @xmath35 the equation @xmath36 under assumption @xmath37 gives the pole in the fourth quadrant of a complex @xmath33 plane , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 since , when @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 in the fourth quadrant , for evaluating of integrals entering eqs.([realpart ] ,  [ imaginpart ] ) one can deform the integration counter as it is shown in fig.1 .",
    "in this way one finds @xmath43 from this equation one sees that the second term gives an imaginary contribution and correspondingly @xmath44 is determined by the residue term only . in the same way one finds that @xmath45 is also determined only by the residue term .",
    "following to the quantum mechanical formalism , and by taking into account that @xmath46 and the localization width of the scalar is @xmath47 , one can simply take @xmath48 thus , the probability of finding the particle on the brane equals one when @xmath25 . by evaluating the residue term and using eq.([initstate ] ) one finds    @xmath49",
    "the minimal representation of spinors in five dimensions can be chosen to be four dimensional .",
    "the five - dimensional minkowskian gamma matrices can be chosen as follows    @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52 the three pauli matrices .",

    "is localized on the brane as long as @xmath85 with the localization width @xmath86 @xcite . under assumption that the initial state is given by the left - handed particle localized on the brane one finds @xmath87",
    "the function @xmath88 may have the poles @xmath89 in the fourth quadrant of complex @xmath33 plane determined by the zeros of @xmath90 indicating the presence of resonances in the spectrum of kk modes .",
    "for evaluating the integral ( [ leamlitu ] ) one can deform the integration contour as it is shown in fig.1 . in this way one gets",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 so that the probability to find the particle on the brane at time @xmath26 is given by @xmath93 one can easily check that @xmath94 namely , by using eqs.([fereqimzer],[ferhamimzer ] ) and taking into account that @xmath95 is an even function of @xmath96 one sees that in this expression the odd function is integrated over a symmetric region .",
    "so that the evolution of the decay process requires some time to reach the regime of exponential decay . for large values of time @xmath97 the second term in eq.([fermintdefor ] ) becomes dominant for which in this limit only modes with @xmath98 are relevant .",
    "therefore , the non - escape probability behaves asymptotically as @xmath99 thus , after a long time the decay proceeds with respect to the power law .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite one can choose the index @xmath100 in such a way ( @xmath101 ) the hankel function @xmath102 to have exactly one zero in the fourth quadrant of complex @xmath103 plane .",
    "this is the only zero of the product @xmath104 located in the fourth quadrant since for real values of @xmath100 , @xmath105 . from the trajectories of zeros presented in @xcite one",
    "sees that if @xmath100 is close to @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) the function @xmath108 has the zero @xmath38 in the fourth quadrant such that @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "( [ zeroenfersol ] ) for the initial state of the low lying kk resonances one can simply take @xmath111 so that at @xmath25 the particle is known to be on the brane , @xmath112 , with probability one . using eq.([ferinitstate ] ) and the previous consideration one can perform the concrete calculations for different low lying kk resonances .",
    "from the present consideration one sees that if the transverse equation contains the second order time derivative the corresponding decay law has the exponential form as long as @xmath113 .",
    "so that under this assumption the decay of massive initially brane localized metastable modes for scalar , vector and gravitational fields follows to the exponential law .",
    "it should be stressed that the choice @xmath22 which is essential to this result is not unique .",
    "however we find this condition to be natural as it corresponds to the free particle on the brane ( [ plwde ] ) with energy @xmath23 corresponding to the metastable state .",
    "in contrast , the decay of massive quasilocalized fermion modes does not follow completely to the exponential law . as in the standard quantum mechanical case mentioned in the introduction , initially the decay is slower than exponential , then comes the exponential region and after a long time it obeys a power law .",
    "the present approach allows one to evaluate the preexponential term as well as the whole dynamics of the decay and can be important to evaluate dynamics for any process based on this phenomenon , for instance to examine more precisely the cosmological constraints on the paradigm of decaying dark matter in the braneworld model .",
