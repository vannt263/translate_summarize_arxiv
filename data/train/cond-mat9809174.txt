    "it has been known for a long time that if an antiferromagnet with suitable anisotropy is placed in an external magnetic field @xmath1 parallel to the easy axis ( the axis along which the spins are aligned , in opposite directions on different sublattices , in zero magnetic field ) and the field strength is increased , a first - order transition will occur @xcite in which the spins are realigned in directions ( approximately ) perpendicular to the applied field , but with a component along the field direction .",
    "the transition to this _ spin flop _ phase occurs when @xmath1 is equal to a spin - flop field @xmath4 , whose value depends on the exchange energy and the anisotropy . as @xmath1 continues to increase beyond @xmath4 ,",
    "the spins on the two sublattices rotate towards the field direction till eventually , if the field is sufficiently large , they are parallel to each other in a ferromagnet structure .    in 1968 mills",

    "interest in this problem was recently rekindled through experimental work on layered structures consisting of fe / cr(211 ) superlattices@xcite .",
    "if the thickness of the cr layers is chosen appropriately , adjacent fe blocks are coupled antiferromagnetically , and thus in zero magnetic field they exhibit an antiferromagnetic structure in which the magnetization of each layer is opposite to that of the adjoining layers . applying an external magnetic field parallel to the layers can give rise to phase transitions in which the magnetization in certain layers rotates or reverses its direction , and the results found experimentally depend upon whether the number of fe layers is even or odd .",
    "the experimental work has motivated a number of theoretical and numerical studies of finite and semi - infinite systems @xcite .",
    "most of these have found evidence for the existence of ssf states .    in the present paper",
    "we address the issue of the existence of ssf phases and some related topics by studying the properties of the ground states of chains of antiferromagnetically coupled classical @xmath2 spins , each spin variable represented by an angle @xmath7 between 0 and @xmath8 , subject to a uniaxial anisotropy @xmath0 as well as to an external magnetic field @xmath1 , as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "our aim is to identify the zero - temperature phases of this system , that is , those which minimize the energy . minimizing the energy of a one - dimensional system corresponds to minimizing the free energy of a layered three - dimensional system when the fluctuations within each individual layer are not playing an important role , as is the case for the fe / cr superlattices mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "the phase diagram of the system consists of three separate regions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afinf ] . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the line @xmath13 separates the ferromagnetic ( f ) configuration , with all the spins parallel to the field , from the antiferromagnetic ( af ) one with the spins alternating between 0 and @xmath14 , parallel and anti - parallel to the field . along the af : f boundary the ground state is infinitely degenerate since it is possible to flip any number of non - adjacent spins in the f chain with no change in energy .    for @xmath15 and intermediate values of @xmath1",

    "we now consider the case when an infinite chain is constrained by suitable boundary conditions to include a discommensuration ( for detailed studies of discommensurations in frenkel - kontorova models see , for example , references [ ] ) .",
    "the study of the discommensuration phase diagram is important because it helps to understand the minimal energy configurations observed both in semi - infinite and finite systems .",
    "a discommensuration is a defect which can arise in a periodic phase whose period is two or greater .",
    "in particular , the af ground state has period two and is degenerate : for one ground state @xmath21 for @xmath11 even and @xmath14 for @xmath11 odd ; for the other , @xmath22 for @xmath11 even and @xmath23 for @xmath11 odd .",
    "a discommensuration results if one requires that a single configuration @xmath24 approach one of these ground states as @xmath11 tends to @xmath25 and the other as @xmath11 tends to @xmath26 ; for instance , @xmath27    the defect energy of a discommensuration is the difference between the energy of the configuration containing the discommensuration and the energy of the corresponding ground state .",
    "since both of these energies are infinite for an infinite chain , a proper definition requires some care ; see , e.g. , [ ] .",
    "we are interested in discommensurations which , for a given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , minimize this energy ; they constitute what we call the discommensuration phase diagram .",
    "it is convenient to start by considering the limiting case @xmath28 , where the spins are constrained to lie along the ising positions . for @xmath29",
    "the discommensuration of minimum energy is a configuration in which two successive spins someplace in the middle of the chain are parallel to the field @xmath1 : @xmath30 in the following we will use the notation af@xmath31 to label this phase . when @xmath13 , due to the absence of further - than - nearest - neighbor interactions , there is not a unique minimum - energy discommensuration associated with the af phase .",
    "one can have any arbitrary even number of spins aligned with the field , not just two , as in ( [ eqn : isdisc ] ) , and other , more complicated defects are possible .",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath32 has period one and is non - degenerate , so there are no discommensurations .    as the spin anisotropy @xmath0 decreases from infinity , lower energies may occur if in a discommensuration the spins are not limited to the ising values @xmath23 and @xmath14 . for these cases",
    "it is difficult to find an explicit analytic form for the minimum energy discommensuration , and one has to use numerical techniques to tackle the problem .",
    "the numerical procedure that we have adopted relies on the method of effective potentials [ ] , which is very efficient for obtaining the ground state of models with short range interactions and discretized variables .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it yields the true ground state , rather than some metastable one .",
    "the main disadvantage for our problem is that it requires the spin variables to be discretized : they can take on only a finite number of values .",
    "we generally used a discretization grid in which each @xmath10 is an integer times @xmath33 . to overcome the effects of the discretization we first fixed the anisotropy at some intermediate value , typically @xmath34 , then used the chou - griffiths algorithm@xcite to identify minimal energy states of different phases for the system of discretized spins , and , finally , employed the equilibrium equations , @xmath35 for continuous spins in order to refine the configurations obtained using discretized spins .",
    "the phase boundaries located by comparing the energies of neighboring phases , calculated using the refined configurations , were then followed as the value of @xmath0 was changed in small steps , while the spin configurations were updated using ( [ eqn : eqeqns ] ) .",
    "the location of the phase boundaries was then checked against those obtained starting with finer discretization grids .",
    "we established that , using a discretization of @xmath36 , the error in the location of the boundary , @xmath37 , was in the range of @xmath38 throughout the range of @xmath0 values we studied .",
    "the procedure just described was used to find minimum energy configurations of a ring of spins ( periodic boundary conditions ) of length @xmath39 with @xmath39 odd , so as to produce a configuration containing a discommensuration .",
    "when @xmath39 is large ( we used @xmath40 ) compared to the size of the discommensuration , this is practically the same as studying the minimal energy discommensuration in an infinite chain .",
    "the numerical results are summarized in the discommensuration phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : afpd ] .",
    "there are , of course , no discommensurations in the f phase . as for the sf phase ,",
    "our numerical results showed a smooth variation of spin angles with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and consequently no phase transitions .",
    "however , various phase transitions were identified for af phase discommensurations . in the af@xmath31 region ,",
    "[ fig : afpd ] , the spins in the minimum energy discommensuration stay locked in their @xmath28 positions .",
    "the persistence of this ising spin locking for finite values of the anisotropy is a rather common feature in models with two - fold spin anisotropy [ ] .",
    "here it has the consequence that the multiphase degeneracy encountered at the point @xmath41 persists throughout the locus @xmath42 .    for values of",
    "@xmath0 lying below the lower boundary of af@xmath31 , but still inside the af region in fig .",
    "[ fig : afpd ] , `` flopped '' discommensurations of different length have lower energies than the ising discommensuration ( [ eqn : isdisc ] ) .",
    "a flopped discommensuration of type @xmath43 consists of a `` core '' of @xmath44 spins in which the spin configuration resembles that in a bulk spin - flop phase , located between `` tails '' , each of which rapidly reverts to the configuration of the corresponding af phase with increasing distance from the core ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : afsfins ] ) .",
    "one can think of the region where the core changes into the tail as an `` interface '' between the af phase out in the tail and the sf phase in the core . from this perspective , the discommensuration consists of a pair of interfaces , af - sf and sf - af , bounding the sf core .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , these interfaces broaden , making the distinction between the `` tails '' and the `` core '' less clear , but we continue to use the same label @xmath43 for the discommensuration which evolves continuously from the one with a clearly - defined core of size @xmath44 at larger @xmath0 .    an analytic calculation , see sec .  [ sec : anres ] , shows that the equation for the second - order transition between af@xmath31 and @xmath45 in fig .",

    "our numerical procedures found values of @xmath44 up to 14 , and we were able to trace the first - order lines separating the different @xmath51 phases down to a value of @xmath0 between 0.1 and 0.4 . for smaller values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the difference @xmath52 of the energy derivatives @xmath53 in two neighboring phases was no longer sufficient to allow us to distinguish the phases numerically and locate the phase boundary .",
    "see the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : afderiv ] .",
    "however , we found no evidence that these lines terminate in critical points . the smooth decrease of @xmath52 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : afderiv ] contrasts with what one might expect at a critical point ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : afendpoint1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems plausible to assume that the @xmath54 boundaries persist all the way down to @xmath55 .",
    "the sequence of transitions associated with a broadening of the discommensuration can be understood in the following way .",
    "the defect energy of a discommensuration can be thought of as the sum of the energy required to produce a pair of af - sf and sf - af interfaces infinitely far apart , an interaction energy between the interfaces which we assume is positive and rises rapidly as they approach each other , and a `` bulk '' contribution proportional to the size of the core , arising from the fact that in the af part of the phase diagram , the sf phase is metastable . in terms of",
    "which discommensuration has the lowest energy , the interface repulsion obviously favors a large core , and the metastable `` penalty '' a small core . the actual size will represent some compromise between the two . upon approaching the af : sf boundary , the metastable penalty goes to zero , so the discommensuration of minimum energy should become larger and larger . hence one expects the @xmath56 boundary to approach the af : sf transition line as @xmath57 .",
    "this is consistent with our numerical calculations , and in agreement with the predictions of papanicolaou [ ] .",
    "( note , however , that these transitions reflect the discrete nature of the spin chain and therefore are absent in the continuum approximation employed in [ ] for small spin anisotropy . ) the triple points at which the phases af@xmath31 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 meet tend to an accumulation point , @xmath60 , located at @xmath61 .",
    "this should be the point at which the energy to create a pair of af - sf and sf - af interfaces infinitely far apart is equal to the energy of an ising discommensuration .",
    "we now consider the surface states of a semi - infinite chain .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is the same as ( [ eqn : afhaminf ] ) but with the sum extending only over non - negative values of @xmath11 ( @xmath62 denotes the surface site ) :    @xmath63 \\biggr\\}\\ .",
    "\\label{eqn : afhamseminf}\\ ] ]    it is useful to think of semi - infinite chains as obtained by cutting an infinite chain in two . removing a bond in the infinite chain without allowing the spins to move will give two semi - infinite chains that we shall term unreconstructed .",
    "if the spins of the unreconstructed chains are then allowed to relax , a rearrangement of the spins near the surface may take place , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] , which lowers the energy .",
    "notice that even though the total energy of the semi - infinite chain is infinite , _ changes _ in the energy when a configuration is modified near the surface ( or in a way such that the modifications decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing distance from the surface ) are well defined .",
    "we want to consider surface states which minimize the energy in the sense that no local modifications of the configuration near the surface can decrease the energy .    the task of finding the reconstructed surface of minimum energy is , in general , not simple ( except when all the spins in the chain are subject to the ising locking ) .",
    "to identify the minimal energy surface states we used numerical algorithms based on effective potential methods that , as mentioned earlier , require a discretization of the spin variables at each site . it is important to notice that , since the @xmath10 s are constrained to take on only discrete values , after a finite distance , or `` penetration depth '' @xmath64 from the surface the spins will be _ exactly _ in the discretized positions corresponding to a doubly - infinite chain or an unreconstructed surface .",
    "configurations for the infinite chain were obtained using the floria - griffiths algorithm @xcite which , within the limits of the discretization , yields the exact ground state .",
    "next , the chou - griffiths algorithm @xcite with its successive iterations was used to generate reconstructed surface configurations @xmath65 .",
    "this should give the exact configuration minimizing the surface energy for the discrete spins .",
    "however , in practice we had to limit @xmath64 to a maximum value @xmath66 no larger than 50 ; thus the method could not yield the correct configuration for a larger penetration depth .",
    "the phase boundaries were then identified as explained in the previous section .    the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afseminf ] . throughout the f region",
    "the minimum energy surface states are simply the unreconstructed surfaces ; it is easy to see that making any changes will increase the energy . in the sf region ,",
    "since the ground state of the infinite chain has period two , there are two unreconstructed surfaces .",
    "each of them undergoes a reconstruction in which the spins nearest the surface tilt towards the magnetic field direction , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut](c ) .",
    "however , this change in spin direction occurs continuously as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and so no surface phase transitions are observed inside the sf region .",
    "next consider the af part of the phase diagram .",
    "again there exist two possible surface states , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , whose unreconstructed versions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , have surface spins parallel ( @xmath71 ) or opposite ( @xmath72 ) to the field direction : @xmath73 a surface will be said to be of type @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) if the spin configuration tends to that of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) far from the surface .    throughout the af region of the phase diagram ,",
    "the minimum energy surface of type @xmath67 is the unreconstructed @xmath69 .",
    "however , the @xmath68-type surface shows a number of different structures in different parts of the af region , as indicated in figs .",

    "af@xmath75 , which meets af@xmath74 along a line @xmath76 for @xmath0 larger than the value at @xmath77 , it is energetically favorable to flip the surface spin so that it points along the field direction , and there is a set of degenerate ( equal minimum energy ) reconstructed surfaces @xmath78 and so forth , where @xmath79 consists of @xmath80 spins @xmath81 in an antiferromagnetic arrangement , followed by two spins parallel to the field , and then the bulk antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "one can think of this reconstructed surface as an ising discommensuration , whose core consists of two adjacent spins with @xmath21 , located a distance @xmath80 from the surface .",
    "because the `` tails '' of this discommensuration have zero length , it does not interact with the surface , and its energy is independent of its distance from the surface . while this degeneracy persists throughout the af@xmath75 region , along the line",
    "@xmath82 the degeneracy is even greater : the set of minimum energy surface states includes cases where the number of consecutive spins pointing along the field is not limited to 2 but can attain any even number , e.g. , @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "incidentally , we note that these degeneracies are somewhat artificial in that they would be lifted by introducing weak longer - range interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : afhamseminf ] ) .    in the af@xmath85 region of fig .",
    "[ fig : afseminf ] the @xmath68-type surface again reconstructs , but the spin anisotropy is sufficiently low that the spins unlock from the ising angles . as in the af@xmath75 region , one can think of the surface state as consisting of a discommensuration located a finite distance from the surface , but now this discommensuration is of the flopped type with a core of length two , and tails extending out on either side of the core .",
    "we again employ the notation @xmath79 for the surface state with @xmath80 spins to the left of the core , that is , in the tail extending to the surface .",
    "because of this tail , the discommensuration interacts with the surface , and the minimum surface energy occurs for a specific value of @xmath80 , depending upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 . thus , in af@xmath85 , one finds genuine spin - flop surface states . as @xmath1 increases , the discommensuration moves further from the surface .",
    "it does this , at least when @xmath0 is large , discontinuously in steps of 2 , via a series of first - order phase transitions , some of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afseminf2 ] , where they extend leftwards from the point @xmath86 . for smaller values of @xmath0 ,",

    "[ fig : afendpoint1 ] , which shows the typical behavior of the energy derivatives of two neighboring phases along their coexistence line . near a critical point @xmath95 one expects @xmath52 to vary as @xmath96 , in qualitative agreement with what we observed .",

    "[ fig : afseminf ] , the region af@xmath85 becomes extremely narrow as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "the left boundary approaches a parabola @xmath98 to within numerical precision , which is asymptotically the same as ( [ e.bound1 ] ) .",
    "we nonetheless believe that the width of af@xmath85 remains finite as long as @xmath99 .",
    "numerical evidence for this is shown in fig .  [ f3 ] where the value of the surface spin , @xmath100 , at the left edge of the af@xmath85 region ( that is for @xmath1 just large enough to produce the surface spin - flop phase ) is plotted as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the results are for @xmath101 spins in the surface layer ( see the description of the numerical approach given above ) .",
