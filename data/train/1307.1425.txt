    "the focus of this paper will be the introduction of a new technique for bounding the width of a lagrangian @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to previous work we will not need to assume @xmath0 is monotone and we will not use the sophisticated machinery behind other suggested approaches . the main idea will be to consider lagrangian floer cohomology @xmath15 , generated by hamiltonian chords for an auxiliary exact lagrangian @xmath16 in a liouville manifold , where the hamiltonian @xmath17 induces geodesic flow in a weinstein neighborhood of @xmath0 . with this set - up",
    "we are able to use lagrangian floer theory in its simplest form , the case of an exact lagrangian , and the hamiltonian @xmath17 takes the role of @xmath0 . at a functional level",
    "we have replaced @xmath18 , with all of the potential complications inherent in lagrangian floer theory in the general case , with the well - behaved object @xmath15 .    given a relatively embedded ball @xmath19 for @xmath0",
    ", we will pick an auxiliary exact lagrangian @xmath1 that agrees with the imaginary axis in the ball and can be displaced from @xmath0 by a hamiltonian isotopy . by construction",
    "the center of the ball @xmath20 is a generator in the chain complex @xmath21 and the fact @xmath1 can be displaced from @xmath0 leads to the existence of a differential connecting a chord @xmath22 and the constant chord @xmath23 . in favorable cases , in particular",
    "if @xmath22 does not represent a geodesic loop based at @xmath23 , from such differentials we are able to extract a holomorphic curve in @xmath19 whose energy gives bounds on the size of the ball .",

    "see section  [ s : preliminaries ] for the definition , and any compact set in @xmath36 is displaceable , by theorem  [ t : main ] the width of any closed oriented lagrangian in @xmath36 is finite if it admits a metric of non - positive curvature .",

    "unfortunately we know of no example where the inequality is sharp .    in the context of the overview given above , the non - positive curvature assumption in theorem  [ t : main ] gives restrictions on the type of chords that can be connected to the center of the ball via a differential and serves to ensure we can extract a non - trivial holomorphic curve in the ball .",

    "a key element of this proof is that the liouville class @xmath159 gives an additional filtration on the chain complex @xmath160}(l;h_{q})$ ] and detects when differentials leave the weinstein neighborhood @xmath123 , which is established in section  [ s : nuf ] .",

    "the idea of proving things about a lagrangian @xmath0 using a hamiltonian @xmath17 that induces geodesic flow in a weinstein neighborhood of @xmath0 goes back to at least viterbo s @xcite proof of maslov class rigidity for lagrangian tori in @xmath36 .",

    "<S> the width of a lagrangian is the largest capacity of a ball that can be symplectically embedded into the ambient manifold such that the ball intersects the lagrangian exactly along the real part of the ball . due to dimitroglou rizell </S>",
    "<S> , finite width is an obstruction to a lagrangian admitting an exact lagrangian cap in the sense of eliashberg  murphy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a new method for bounding the width of a lagrangian @xmath0 by considering the lagrangian floer cohomology of an auxiliary lagrangian @xmath1 with respect to a hamiltonian whose chords correspond to geodesic paths in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is formalized as a wrapped version of the floer  </S>",
