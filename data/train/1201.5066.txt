    "@xmath3 meson transition form factors are an essential input of the factorization approaches to nonleptonic two - body @xmath3 meson decays , such as the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite based on the @xmath1 factorization theorem @xcite . for next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions in leading - twist pqcd , the vertex corrections , the quark loops , and the magnetic penguins associated with the weak decay vertices in factorizable emission amplitudes have been calculated @xcite . as explained in @xcite",
    ", the above corrections may be the most crucial nlo pieces for understanding the known @xmath5 and @xmath6 puzzles , which result from the large observed @xmath7 branching ratio , and from the dramatically different direct cp asymmetries between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes , respectively .",
    "there have been many applications of this nlo pqcd formalism to nonleptonic two - body @xmath3 and @xmath10 meson decays in the literature . for nlo corrections to spectator diagrams , we have identified the so - called glauber divergences , in additional to those which are absorbed into hadron wave functions , and summed them into a phase factor to all orders @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the phase factor modifies the interference pattern between the spectator diagrams , and further improves the resolution of the @xmath5 , @xmath11 puzzles in nlo pqcd . at the same level of accuracy",
    ", we need to calculate nlo corrections to the @xmath3 meson transition form factors for completeness .",
    "in this paper we shall extend the nlo framework for the pion electromagnetic form factor in the @xmath1 factorization @xcite to the @xmath0 transition form factors . in this framework light partons in both qcd quark diagrams and effective diagrams for hadron wave functions are off mass shell by @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "not only the collinear divergences from gluon emissions collimated to the pion , but also the soft divergences from gluon exchanges between the two mesons exist .",
    "compared to the pion form factor @xcite , a new point is that an infrared regulator associated with the @xmath12 quark is not needed . due to its finite mass , gluons radiated by the @xmath12 quark do not generate collinear divergences .",
    "soft divergences can be regularized either by the virtuality of internal particles , or by the virtuality @xmath2 of other light partons , to which the radiative gluons attach .",
    "that is , the @xmath12 quark remains on - shell in the above framework , a condition which justifies the approximation of the @xmath12 quark field by the effective heavy - quark field for defining the @xmath3 meson wave function .",
    "the nlo pion wave function is found to be identical to those constructed in the pion electromagnetic and transition form factors @xcite , consistent with its universality .",
    "note that the diagrams considered here differ from those in the qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) approach @xcite and in the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , which are based on the collinear factorization theorem @xcite : there is no end - point singularity in the @xmath1 factorization , so it is not necessary to introduce soft form factors @xcite or to perform the zero - bin subtraction @xcite in our calculation .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the collinear and soft divergences in the quark diagrams are cancelled by those in the effective diagrams for the @xmath3 meson and pion wave functions .",
    "taking the difference of the above sets of diagrams , we derive the @xmath1-dependent nlo hard kernel at leading twist for the @xmath0 transition form factors .",
    "the infrared finiteness of the hard kernel confirms the application of the @xmath1 factorization theorem to @xmath3 meson semileptonic decays @xcite .",
    "similar to the analysis in @xcite , both the large double logarithms @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 being a parton momentum fraction , are identified .",
    "the former is absorbed into the @xmath3 meson and pion wave functions and summed to all orders in the coupling constant @xmath16 by the @xmath1 resummation @xcite , and the latter is absorbed into a jet function and summed to all orders by the threshold resummation @xcite . due to the dominant soft dynamics associated with the @xmath12 quark ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath1 resummation from the @xmath3 meson side is minor .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath17 and the factorization scale @xmath18 are introduced by higher - order corrections to the quark diagrams and to the effective diagrams , respectively .",
    "choosing @xmath17 and @xmath18 appropriately , with both being lower than the @xmath3 meson mass as postulated in @xcite , the nlo corrections are under control : they amount only up to 30% of the form factors at large recoil of the pion , when varying models for the meson wave functions .    in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the @xmath19 qcd quark diagrams for the @xmath20 semileptonic decay , the @xmath21 effective diagrams for the @xmath3 meson and pion wave functions , and their convolutions with the @xmath21 hard kernel . since the @xmath1 factorization is appropriate for qcd processes dominated by contributions from small @xmath15 @xcite , we shall keep only terms in leading power of @xmath15 .",
