    "understanding the proximity effect in superconducting films is important for the development of practical devices such as superconducting tunnel junctions ( stj s ) . depositing a superconductor @xmath3 onto another @xmath4 modifies the properties of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 materials .",
    "if both superconductors are thick enough ( typically thicker than @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the coherence length of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) ) , the extremities of the bilayer behave as bulk materials obeying the bcs theory , though not necessarily like bulk @xmath3 and bulk @xmath4 .",
    "the intermediate region around the @xmath3-@xmath4 interface is characterised by a relatively sharp transition between the two bulk - like regions , and can be pretty far from a bcs - like description .",
    "if the layers are relatively thin , any bcs - like behaviour can be absent from the structure .",
    "finally , in the case where the layers are extremely thin , as described by mcmillan @xcite , each layer behaves again like a bcs superconductor .",
    "the physical quantities affected in a proximised bulk superconductor , are the cooper pair potential @xmath7 , the density of states for the cooper pairs , @xmath8 , and the density of states for the quasiparticles , @xmath9 . as the density of states in both superconductors",
    "is modified due to the proximity effect , the resultant bandgap @xmath10 lies at an intermediate value between the bulk values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "this feature has been fully described in the specific case , of a thin , low bandgap material @xmath4 next to a thick , high bandgap material @xmath3 , with both superconductors in the dirty limit @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to present the need for , and develop a model of , the proximity effect , which is not restricted to this very specific case",
    ".    in particular section  [ numeric : applic ] shows that there are many situations where this special case does not apply , and for which the simple bcs approach does not provide a satisfactory description .",
    "specifically , in the case of stj s used as photon detectors , a more general description of the proximity effect is required to adequately address such issues as device performance .",
    "the general conditions for an extended model are presented in section  [ sufficient ] .",
    "such a model can be applied not only to stj s , but also to any application involving bi- or trilayers of superconductors .",
    "the single factor which would make the model inapplicable is the roughness of the @xmath3-@xmath4 interface .",
    "the limitations caused by this parameter are therefore also discussed .",
    "the extended model is described in section  [ prox ] , while numerical calculations based on the model are presented in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "the model is applied to existing stj s in section  [ numeric : applic ] , so as to highlight a typical application of the model .",
    "the proximity effect in dirty @xmath3-@xmath4 bilayers was studied previously in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite for the case of arbitrary transparency of the @xmath3-@xmath4 interface , but only the case of a thin @xmath4 layer and bulk @xmath3 layer was considered .",
    "more recently , the case of arbitrary thickness of @xmath4 and @xmath3 layers was considered in @xcite , but only the limiting case of the high transparency of the @xmath3-@xmath4 interface with @xmath13 was studied . here",
    "we generalise the theory to the case of arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath3 layer thicknesses for the most general case of a finite critical temperature for the @xmath4 layer with @xmath14 .",
    "we also consider the case of trilayer systems @xmath15 with a very thin @xmath16 layer .",
    "the trilayer model remains valid for any thickness of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the model is constructed for the case of @xmath17 , but @xmath18 can have any value .    in case",
    "where the relevant length scales ( coherence lengths , mean free paths and sample thicknesses ) are much larger than the atomic scale , the proximity effect can be described in terms of a quasiclassical green s function formalism @xcite-@xcite .    for an arbitrary relationship between the electronic mean",
    "free path and the coherence length the density of states can be derived from the solution of the eilenberger equations @xcite .",

    "the main restriction of the model presented here is the use of dirty superconductors .",
    "it is straigthforward to show that , in most cases , the clean limit does not need to be considered .",
    "the difference between clean and dirty limits lies in the presence of impurities or crystallographic dislocations in a dirty superconductor , acting as scattering centres for quasiparticles .",
    "if scattering centres are on average separated by a distance smaller than the coherence length , then the dirty limit applies . in other words",
    ", the dirty limit localy applies to a spherical region of radius equal to the coherence length , and centered at a scattering centre .",
    "the physical presence of interfaces ensures the presence of scattering centres . as long as the interfaces affect several atomic layers of both superconductors , the boundary conditions are those of the dirty limit .",
    "moreover , over a scale length equal to the coherence length in both films , any solutions for the pair potential and the densities of states are also governed by the same equations valid in a dirty superconductor . at depths larger than the coherence length ,",
    "the fluctuations in pair potential and in densities of states are not significant , and the behaviour tends towards that of a bulk superconductor @xcite .",
    "anderson s theorem @xcite implies that in the case of a bulk superconductor , the solutions in the clean limit are the same as in the dirty limit .",
    "hence , any solution for the pair potential and the density of states in regions of the films deeper than the coherence length , is expected to be a smooth interpolation between two dirty regions ( in the case of a clean region separated by two rough boundaries ) , or a smooth extrapolation out of a single dirty region ( in the case of a clean region located between a rough boundary and a flat one ) .",
    "the solutions related to such smooth interpolations or extrapolations are identical , independently of the use of the equations valid for the clean or for the dirty limit .",
    "the clean limit only need to be considered in cases of atomically sharp inferfaces , where the roughness @xmath84 of the @xmath3-@xmath4 interface is of the order of or smaller than the interatomic distance of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( typically around 4 - 5   ) .",
    "this case is extremely restrictive , and also technically difficult to achieve , even with the most advanced methods of epitaxial thin film depositions .",
    "it leads to the conclusion that the clean limit does not need to be considered .",
    "in this section some typical examples of pair potential and density of states for the quasiparticles are determined and discussed for bi- and trilayers .      for this bilayer",
    ", we have solved numerically the usadel equations ( [ us])-([self ] ) by a selfconsistent procedure similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but without the approximation @xmath65 .",
    "we start from the trial pair potentials @xmath85 and find the solutions for @xmath86 in the matsubara representation ( @xmath87 ) . using these solutions ,",
    "the new pair potentials @xmath88 are found from the selfconsistency equation .",
    "the iterations are repeated until convergence is achieved .",
    "next , after the pair potentials are determined , we solve the equations ( [ us])-([self ] ) on the real energy axis @xmath89 . according to equ.([n ] ) , this method provides spatially and energy resolved densities of states in both layers .    in order to demonstrate the validity of the approach and to be representative of the devices discussed in section [ numeric : applic ] ,",
    "the cases of an al - nb and an al - ta bilayer ( @xmath90  k , @xmath91 k , @xmath92  k ) at @xmath93  k are considered .",
    "the parameters for this simulation are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 .",
    "this choice of parameters is justified in section [ numeric : applic ] .",
    "the results are represented in fig.1 .",
    "the quantities represented here are the pair potential as a function of position in the bilayer ( fig .",
    "1a ) and the density of states at different positions ( fig .",
    "the density of states of fig .",
    "1b is shown at the free interface of @xmath3 ( nb ) and of @xmath4 ( al ) ( solid lines ) , and on both sides of the al - nb interface ( dashed lines ) . in al ,",
    "the density of states is peaking at an energy slightly higher than the gap , and then roughly decreases to 1 for infinite energies . getting closer to the nb film ,",
    "a smaller peak is also visible around the energy gap of pure nb . in nb",
    ", the density of states is strongly peaking around @xmath100 , and goes to 1 at infinite energy .",
    "below @xmath100the density of states is very much depressed as compared to the density of states in al .",
    "however , it stays finite and importantly the energy gap is the same as in the al film .",
    "the position dependence of the energy gap is represented on fig .",
    "1a ( dashed line in the middle ) .",
    "clearly , it is not position dependent at all , despite the very strong fluctuations of the pair potential .",
    "it must be stressed that , even if fig .",
    "1b suggests a small density of states in nb below @xmath101 , this level actually corresponds to a significant number of states . as a matter of fact , the density of states at the free interface of nb ( solid line in fig .",
    "1b ) at 0.3@xmath100 is @xmath102states / mev/@xmath103m@xmath104 .",
    "despite the fact that the gap is constant , the reduction in the dos still has an effect on quasiparticle dynamics , since the quasiparticles in the energy range @xmath105 entering nb are partially andreev reflected . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the probability to enter the reduced density of states region is proportional to @xmath106 .      for this simulation",
    "the parameters are @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 again the choice of this set of parameters is explained in section [ numeric : applic ] .",
    "the results are represented in fig 2 .",
    "the value used for @xmath60 is very similar to that used for the nb - based sample , whereas the value used for @xmath61 is about 20 times lower .",
    "this has a direct impact on the shape of the pair potential ( fig .",
    "2a ) and the density of states ( fig .",
    "the discontinuity at the ta / al interface is extremely strong .",
    "the behaviour of ta is almost bulk - like , with a constant pair potential and a steep peak of the density of states at around @xmath113 .",
    "however there is still a considerable amount of states available in ta below @xmath113 ( typically 0.1 @xmath114 2@xmath115 = 8.1 10@xmath116 states / mev/@xmath117 ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the pair potential and the density of states within al are also rather small , though a clear contribution from ta remains visible at @xmath113 . despite the very weak coupling between al and ta",
    ", the gap is still constant through the whole device thickness .",
    "such a strong discontinuity at the interface emphasizes the role of quasiparticle confinement in al , due to andreev reflections .",
    "next we consider two representative examples of a trilayer system : al - nb - nbn and al - nb - ta , which also do have practical applications .",
    "the inclusion of a thin nbn passivation layer on the top electrode of an al - nb stj in place of the natural niobium oxides reduces the quasiparticle loss rate , thereby enhancing the probability of multiple tunnel processes @xcite . on the other hand the deposition of a thin nb layer on top of the al facilitates the deposition of the top ta in al - ta stjs .",
    "the best ta based devices , in terms of detection of optical photons , have a top electrode of this kind .    in both cases",
    "the al layer has a thickness @xmath118 , for which the thin layer approximation works reasonably well , while no limitation on the thickness of other layers was introduced.the method of numerical solution in this case is similar to that for a bilayer with additional boundary conditions ( [ bc3 ] ) , as described in the previous section .      in the case of al - nb - nbn",
    "we have taken thicknesses @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the parameters of the al - nb interface are @xmath123 and @xmath124 , as in the previous example . for the nb - nbn interface @xmath125",
    "is expected from the resistivity ratio , while for the barrier transparency parameter we have assumed @xmath126 .",
    "the results of calculations of the spatial distribution of the pair potential in the al - nb - nbn trilayer are shown in fig.3a .",
    "the dashed line shows the energy gap , which is again constant across the trilayer .",
    "the densities of states are shown in fig.3b at the free interface of nbn , @xmath127 ( solid line ) , on both sides of the nbn - nb interface , @xmath128 ( dashed lines ) , on the nb side of the nb - al interface , @xmath129 ( solid line ) and in al ( dotted line ) . again , in al the density of states is peaking at an energy slightly higher than the gap .",
    "the magnitude of the gap is higher than in the case of fig.1 due to the smaller thickness of al and the influence of the nbn layer .",
    "note , the gap in al is now as big as about half of the gap of pure nbn , @xmath130 .",
    "the density of states at the free interface of nbn , @xmath127 peaks around @xmath130 , while a lot of states are also present in this layer at @xmath131      in the case of al - nb - ta we have taken thicknesses @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "the parameters of the nb - ta interface are assumed to be @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "for the al - nb interface @xmath123 and @xmath138 were chosen again .",
    "the distribution of the pair potential , the energy gap and the local densities of states are shown in fig.4a , b .",
    "the notations in fig.4b are the same as in fig.3b with nbn and ta interchanged .",
    "as is seen from comparison of figs.3 and 4 , the energy gap in the al - nb - ta trilayer is lower than that in the al - nb - nbn .",
    "this is expected , since the only difference between these two cases is that the high gap material , nbn , is substituted by the low gap one , ta .",
    "moreover , the peaks of the density of states in nb are sharper in the case of al - nb - ta trilayer .",
    "the reason is the more homogeneous distribution of the pair potential in this case , as is seen from fig.4a .",
    "the stj would represent a typical but not exclusive example of an application of multi - layered superconducting thin films .",
    "such devices used as photon detectors have produced good results in terms of energy resolution , charge output and quantum efficiency , for photon energies from the near infrared to x - rays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most important results currently achieved can be summarised as follows : ta / al junctions provide a typical response of up to @xmath139 electrons per ev of the detected photon , at a temperature of 300 to 400  mk ; the associated measured energy resolution is within a few percents of the predicted theoretical limit ; the quantum efficiency at uv wavelengths is about 60% ; the longest wavelength detected is currently 2@xmath140 , with the possibility to extend this limit to 10@xmath140 ; the same junctions operate also at x - ray energies as high as 6 kev , with a quantum efficiency of about 10% and an energy resolution of about 40 ev fwhm .",
    "very encouraging results have been also achieved with nb / al @xcite and nbn / nb @xcite stj s . at x - ray energies",
    "( 6 kev ) , the best results currently achieved yield an energy resolution of 12  ev for 5.9  kev photons , with an al - based junction working at 50  mk @xcite .    a major problem to be addressed is the ability to predict the junctions response to photon absorption .",
    "this response can be modified by changing such variables as film thickness , film quality , and overall device dimensions .",
    "especially , the performance of existing devices is still difficult to predict when the proximity effect plays a significant role . in particular ,",
    "a significant difference in junction behaviour has been observed when irradiated by x - rays , as opposed to optical photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "note while the trend in x - ray responsivity reflects the generally increasing role of quasiparticle self - recombination with increasing photon energies , the details of this response have been difficult to model using existing theories .",
    "also , adressing adequately the problems of energy non - linearity ( @xcite-@xcite ) and quasiparticle trapping ( @xcite ) requires a detailed knowledge of the proximity effect theory .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that the existing models for the proximity effect are for very specific cases and regimes only and need generalisation in order to explain the performance of an stj .",
    "the type of junctions in which the energy dependence of the responsivity is difficult to account for are described in @xcite .",
    "they essentially consist of symmetrical nb / al / alo@xmath141/al / nb junctions deposited on super - polished @xmath142-plane sapphire , with 100  nm of nb and 15 to 120  nm of al .",
    "the base electrode is epitaxial , whilst the top is polycrystalline .",
    "the polycrystalline film is usually covered by a thin nbo layer , followed by a nb@xmath143o@xmath144 layer ( @xmath145  nm in total ) , due to the normal exposure to air .",
    "note , the bandgap is much smaller in al than in nb .",
    "the al layer represents the @xmath4 layer , and the nb the @xmath3 layer .",
    "a typical value for the coherence length in bulk , clean al at 0  k is @xmath146  1.6  @xmath140 . for the polycrystalline film ( superscripts",
    "@xmath147 indicates polycrystalline ) , the electron mean free path @xmath148 is limited by the grain size .",
    "using a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) , the grain size in the polycrystalline al film has been estimated at about 40  nm . in the dirty limit ,",
    "the coherence length is given by @xmath149  147  nm , and @xmath150  53  nm .",
    "thus the condition of the dirty limit for the polycrystalline films @xmath3 and @xmath4 is not actually valid .",
    "furthermore , this coherence length is precisely in the middle of the range of al thicknesses available , and the condition of small al thickness is also not satisfied . as for the epitaxial film ( superscripts @xmath151 ) , the mean free path @xmath152 is not limited by the grain size anymore , but it is simply constrained by the boundary scattering due to the thickness of the electrode ( 220  nm ) and thus is always far lower than @xmath153 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with @xmath154 ( resistance residual ratio ) measurements , which lead to an average mean free path of @xmath155  150  nm over the whole electrode .",
    "the coherence length @xmath156 can therefore be assumed to be governed by a dirty environment , and will not exceed @xmath157  nm .",
    "this is not very large compared to either @xmath158 or @xmath159 . as a consequence , in the epitaxial film ,",
    "none of the assumptions associated with the dirty limit and with a thin al layer are valid .    in nb ,",
    "@xmath160  38  nm .",
    "this is very close to the grain size in the polycrystalline film , implying that the nb polycrystalline film is in between the dirty and the clean limit .",
    "if the layer @xmath3 was assumed to be dirty , the coherence length is @xmath161  23  nm . in reality",
    ", it is somewhere between 23 and 38  nm . in any case",
    ", the dirty limit does not apply . in the epitaxial layer ,",
    "@xmath154 measurements have determined an electron mean free path @xmath162  150  nm ; here we are clearly in the clean limit , constrained by boundary scattering , such that for a nb film of thickness 100  nm ( applicable for all examples described herein ) , the condition of a thick @xmath3 layer is not fulfilled .",
    "the model has been applied to two different stj layups .",
    "the first one is a symetrical nb based stj with 100 nm of nb and 90 nm of al .",
    "the second is a symetrical ta based stj with 100 nm of ta and 55 nm of al . in order to determine the density of states and the order parameters , all the input parameters for the proximity effect model have to be established .",

    "these values are actually averages between the values found for polycrystalline and epitaxial films.using these values we determine the ratios of thickness to normalised coherence length as used for the numerical simulations in sections [ numerical ] [ bilayer ] [ al - nb ] and [ al - ta ] .",
    "the method chosen to determine the values of the interface parameters is to compare an experimentally determined value with the theoretical estimate , as derived from a simple analytical expression for this value , which includes the densities of states .",
    "the quantities to be fitted to the model were chosen to be the energy gap as a function of temperature and the critical current as a function of temperature .",
    "both quantities are easily found experimentally from the junctions i - v curve characteristics .",
    "the critical current @xmath171 through the junction is calculated in the following way@xcite @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the normal - state resistance of the junction , and @xmath174 is the local green s function in the vicinity of the barrier in electrode 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "both electrodes are assumed to be identical , therefore simplifying eq .",
    "( [ super ] ) , since @xmath175 , and thereby ensuring a unique set of @xmath176 parameters for the whole junction .",
    "5a and 6a show the model values compared to the experimental data of the energy gap as a function of device temperature for the nb and the ta based stjs respectively .",
    "figs 5b and 6b show essentially the same information , but this time in regard to the critical current .",
