    "neutrinos are the most elusive fermions in the standard electroweak model , partly because they are electrically neutral and their masses are too small as compared with those charged leptons and quarks .",
    "the neutrality and smallness of neutrinos make it experimentally difficult to identify whether they are the dirac or majorana particles , but most theorists believe that massive neutrinos should have the majorana nature ( i.e. , they are their own antiparticles @xcite ) . to verify the majorana nature of massive neutrinos , the most feasible way up to our current experimental techniques is to detect the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay of some even - even nuclei @xcite : @xmath12 , in which the lepton number is violated by two units .",
    "however , the @xmath0 decay is a cp - conserving process and can not directly be used to probe the majorana cp - violating phases .",
    "hence one has to consider other possible ways out of such a situation",
    ".    given three massive neutrinos of the majorana nature , the @xmath13 pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath2 @xcite can be parametrized in terms of three flavor mixing angles ( @xmath14 ) and three cp - violating phases ( @xmath15 ) as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 ) . although @xmath20 is usually referred to as the  dirac \" cp - violating phase which naturally appears in those lepton - number - conserving processes such as neutrino - neutrino and antineutrino - antineutrino oscillations , one should keep in mind that it is actually a majorana phase like @xmath21 or @xmath22 and can also show up in those lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) processes such as the @xmath0 decay and neutrino - antineutrino oscillations .",
    "this point will soon become clear .",
    "so far all the three neutrino mixing angles have been measured to a good degree of accuracy in a number of solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",

    "such a comprehensive analysis of the majorana phases in cp - violating and cp - conserving lnv processes should be useful to illustrate how important they are in both lepton flavor mixing and cp violation and how difficult they are to be measured in reality .    the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
