    "while the transport properties of one - dimensional systems have been of great interest from the point of view of fundamental physics for some time@xcite , recently , further interest in the transport properties of nano - scale one - dimensional systems was aroused because of their importance for the development of molecular electronics , where diverse molecular devices ( switches , memory elements , sensors ) all need to be self - assembled together with electrically conducting molecular - scale wires .",
    "to be of practical use , the connectors need to have reliable contacts and also be able to withstand mechanical deformations while retaining their conducting properties . till",
    "now there has been no recognized material which could be used for this purpose , and this has seriously impeded progress in the development of large scale molecular electronics in recent years .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the transport properties of mo@xmath0s@xmath1i@xmath0 molecular wires@xcite , which have been recently shown to be very promising flexible molecular - scale conductors .",
    "mo@xmath0s@xmath1i@xmath0 wires are air - stable one - dimensional inorganic cluster polymers ( see fig.1 ) , which are unique in that they enable covalent bonding to gold surfaces and organic molecules via sulphur atoms at the ends of each molecular wire@xcite .",
    "single molecular wires were also recently shown to self - assemble gold particles into critical scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "such molecular wires may expect their electron transport properties to be governed by quantum properties on the microscopic level .",
    "thus , to make further progress in molecular electronics with mosi connectors , we must first investigate and understand their molecular scale electronic transport properties .",
    "earlier experimental work has shown metallic signatures , such as a low - frequency drude response in the optical conductivity@xcite , but relatively low room temperature conductivities @xmath3 s / m , which decrease with decreasing temperature@xcite .",
    "recently venkataraman , hong and kim @xcite described electron transport measurements in multichannel li@xmath4mo@xmath0se@xmath0 nanowires with diameters in the range 7.2 to 12 nm in terms of a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) in contact with fermi liquid ( fl ) electrodes . in another related material nbse@xmath1 , nanowires ranging between 30 and 300 nm in diameter have been observed to display similar power - law behaviour , albeit over a rather limited range of temperature@xcite .",
    "the extreme one - dimensional nature of the mosi wires suggests that signatures of tll behaviour might also be observed in thick multi - strand bundles , and not only in very thin wires . on the other hand",
    ", we may expect that the electronic transport properties in mosi wires might depart from ideal tll behaviour because of the deformable nature of the s bridges which link together the mo@xmath0 clusters into 1d chains @xcite .",

    ", width=302,height=302 ]    in this paper we present a systematic study of mosi wires of different diameter from 4 nm to 1000 nm , examining the @xmath8-dependence , diameter dependence and current - voltage characteristics at different temperatures .",
    "we are particularly interested in the behaviour of realistic circuit configurations , with irregular wire geometries .",
    "the intrinsic flexibility of the mosi wires , arising from their accordion - like structure @xcite means that they bend easily to conform to surface contours .",
    "we have therefore focused on dielectrophoretically deposited thin wires over contacts in which the wires conform to the surface relief .",
    "considering the possible transport mechanisms , we confine ourselves to the common ones discussed in literature@xcite , namely tll tunneling@xcite , environmental coulomb blockade @xcite ( ecb ) and variable range hopping ( vrh ) in the presence of coulomb charging effects @xcite :    \\1 .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 dependence for tunneling into a 1d tl liquid via fermi - liquid metal contacts is given by : @xmath11    where @xmath12 and the luttinger parameter @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a fitting parameter that accounts for the voltage drop over the circuit @xcite . a collapsed diagram of the underlying transport characteristic is obtained by plotting @xmath15 against @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the slope of zero voltage conductivity against temperature @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the exponent for the high voltage limit ( @xmath20 ) arising from the power law behavior @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite it also gives a non - zero intercept for @xmath32 given by the charging energy @xmath33 .",
    "3 . for the variable range hopping mode , a plot of @xmath34 ( for low voltage ) against @xmath35 yields curves which become linear with the correct hopping exponent @xmath36 .",
    "the fits to the data typically give a large error in the exponents , so to extract the best value of @xmath36 , fits to the data are tested statistically by calculating pearson s correlation coefficients .    rather than choosing a few measurements which obey one or another type of behaviour , we present here a summary of a number of experiments , to try and understand the different types of behaviour that can arise in nanoscale circuits with mosi wires .",
    "the thin wires were prepared according to the method reported by nicolosi et al @xcite by repeated dispersion and dilution .",
    "the dispersion procedure separates the wires into two distinct categories : thin wires , with diameters @xmath37 nm and thick multichannel bundles with @xmath38 nm@xcite . in the ultrasonic bath processing procedure ,",
    "the defective wires break up into shorter segments , leaving less defective long thin wires in solution .",
    "the individual strands within the thin wires may thus be expected to have significantly fewer imperfections than within the thick bundles , which may result in different electron transport behaviour in thick and thin wires .",
    "this should be evident in the room temperature conductivity ( @xmath39 ) as well as the @xmath8-dependence and @xmath29 systematics .",
    "the wires were dielectrically deposited typically over nickel electrodes prepared by electron beam lithography ( ebl ) by placing a drop of solution over the electrodes and applying a 50hz ac electric field to the electrodes .",

    "the behaviour of na23 is very different to na27 .",

    "( overall , approximately half our circuits showed the tll collapse . )    attempting to fit the ecb model to the data , we would expect the @xmath55 slope to cross over from @xmath56 at low voltages to @xmath57 at high voltages .",
    "correspondingly , the derivative @xmath30 should show a systematic @xmath8-independent cross - over from @xmath58 to 0 corresponding to the low and high voltage limits respectively .",
    "we plot @xmath30 vs. @xmath47 , in figs . 5 a ) and b ) respectively for na23 and na27 .",
    "circuit na27 shows a rather small variation of @xmath30 with v over the entire range of @xmath47 and @xmath8 ( note the small values on the log scale on the @xmath30 axis ) , quite unlike the ecb model predictions .",
    "in contrast , na23 shows a systematic variation with @xmath47 , which for low temperatures is not far from what is expected on the basis of ecb theory : at low @xmath47 , @xmath59 ( within experimental error ) , but clearly saturating at high @xmath47 .",
    "for completeness , attempting to fit the data to the vrh model , we first plotted @xmath34 ( for low voltage ) against @xmath35 for different @xmath36=1/4 to 1 , according to the vrh model ( fig.6 ) . making a statistical evaluation using pearson s correlation test , we find that the best fit is with @xmath60 for na27 and @xmath61 for na23 .",
    "such small values of @xmath36 within vrh models would imply the dominance of 3d hopping processes , which is not expected .",
    "( we shall discuss the implications later ) .",
    "a ubiquitous feature of the thick wire bundles ( @xmath62 ) is their linear i - v characteristic from 18k to 300k @xcite .",
    "the room temperature conductivity @xmath63 is typically 3 orders of magnitude _ smaller _ than for the thin wires , around 1 - 10 s / m .",
    "this is taken as a clear indication that only a small fraction @xmath64 of the molecular strands in the bundle contribute to the transport .",
    "confirming earlier preliminary measurements , the t - dependence was not very well described by a 1d vrh model@xcite .",
    "the new systematic data on many circuits now confirms this .",
    "the dependence of the conductivity is shown in figure 7 for a number of bundles of different diameter .",
    "surprisingly , the data for the different bundles all appear to follow power - law behaviour @xmath65 quite well .",
    "moreover , a systematic trend is observed , whereby the larger diameters have a smaller exponent @xmath17 , an indication that the numbers of conducting channels scales with diameter@xcite ( figure 8) .     of a large number of thick wires , with @xmath66 nm .",
    "in two measurements , a break is obseved , which is believed to be strain - induced change in the number of conducting channels . , width=302,height=302 ]     of thick wires on bundle diameter @xmath67 from the data in fig .",
    "the present set of experiments shows a rather wide range of behaviour , suggesting caution in trying to interpret the data by any single model . discussing the simple vrh model first , our fits give 3d exponents , which is clearly inconsistent with the nature of the system investigated here and is dismissed from further discussion .",
    "the calculation of fogler et al .",
    "@xcite considered a quasi-1d wire with a finite density of impurities modeled by a series of weakly coupled quantum dots .",
    "they predict power law behaviour of the current for both t and v , as @xmath21 at high @xmath47 and @xmath68 at low @xmath47 with @xmath69 .",
    "the model holds for a large number of parallel statistically independent conduction channels , where power laws are not obscured by the fluctuations of g. this case is fulfilled here for thick wires , with bundle diameters between 100 nm and 1 @xmath70 might have @xmath71 to @xmath72 conducting channels .",
    "however , the prediction that @xmath73 is not fulfilled here for either the thin or the thick multichannel bundles , suggesting that this model may not be applicable for describing mosi circuits .    in circuit na 27 the tll prediction can be confirmed with some degree of confidence by the collapsed plot of @xmath15 vs. @xmath16 . for tunneling from a fermi liquid into a perfect tll without defects ,",
    "the model prediction is that @xmath74 .",
    "imperfections , such as deformations and kinks or stoichiometric defects break up the wire into tll segments , which introduces tll - tll tunneling between these segments@xcite , for which the predicted ratio changes to @xmath75 .",
    "the measured value for na27 is @xmath76 .",
    "a similar circuit with a wire diameter of 5 nm ( na12 , not shown ) gives a near - identical collapse as na27 with @xmath77 .",
    "the exponent @xmath17 for a @xmath78-channel wire is given by tll theory@xcite as :    @xmath79,\\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 is the electron - electron interaction parameter .",
    "the number of conducting channels @xmath78 in a nanowire of diameter @xmath67 can be written as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the lattice constant , and @xmath64 is the fraction of molecular wires which actually carry current without interruption . for circuit na27 , using @xmath83 , @xmath52 , and @xmath84 channels ( for @xmath85 nm ) , we calculate @xmath86 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the value 0.15 obtained by venkataraman et al for li@xmath4mo@xmath0se@xmath0 nanowires .",
    "other wires which we have measured have @xmath17 between 2 and 3.5 , giving a range of @xmath87 . comparing this with @xmath80 estimated from materials parameters",
    ", we can use the expression from the coulomb charge screening model@xcite @xmath88 , where @xmath89 m/s is the fermi velocity calculated by dft calculations , @xmath90 is the resistance quantum and the single wire capacitance per unit length is @xmath91}$ ] . using @xmath92 for the si oxide layer of thickness @xmath93 nm , we obtain @xmath94 . in this estimate ,",
    "the dft value of @xmath95 is likely to be overestimated , which may account for a large part of the discrepancy between the values obtained directly from the measurements .",
    "it has also been noted previously that the static coulomb screening model overestimates @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the data in figure 8 for the thick wires can be fit using the expression ( 4 ) .",
    "a range of values of @xmath80 can be obtained from the fits to the present data , @xmath96 with corresponding filling factors @xmath97 .",
    "values outside this range of @xmath80 can not be made to fit the data . however , since the @xmath29 characteristics are ubiquitously linear , for the thick wires , this in itself can not be taken as proof for tll behaviour .",
    "the low value of @xmath63 in thick wires is assumed to be related to imperfections on the wires .",
    "it suggests that the transport along the wires is dominated by tunneling between tll segments .",
    "in fact the resistance of both thick and thin wires is typically of the same order of magnitude , which suggests that in the thick bundles only a very small number of wires are uninterrupted , or that only strands on the outside of the bundle are conducting , with the inner strands being unreachable due to the extremely small perpendicular inter - molecular hopping rates within each wire .    turning to the case of na23 , which shows clear characteristics of ecb behaviour , the intercept of the @xmath29 curve at @xmath32 gives @xmath98v and consequently @xmath99f .",
    "comparing this qdot capacitance with an estimate of c for a single wire over a si ground plane with a 600 nm sio@xmath4 insulating layer and length @xmath100 nm between contacts , we have @xmath101 , for na23 . depending on what we assume for the qdot shape",
    ", its size appears to be some fraction ( @xmath102 ) of the distance between the electrodes .",
    "considering the possible origin of the ecb behaviour and the observed departures from the predicted tll characteristics , we can imagine imperfections and breaks of continuity in the wires of diverse origin .",
    "the most obvious and unavoidable effect arises from the deformation of the nanowires adapting to the relief of the contacts ( figure 2 ) .",
    "their inherent flexibility allows for a substantial deformation , which is accompanied by significant changes in electronic structure near the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "we can thus envisage that the deformations can lead to breaks in the continuity of individual channels , and as a result the formation of a qdot in between the breaks . in this case",
    "the ecb capacitance would scale with the distance between electrodes .",
    "another effect , which might be important arises from the intrinsic tendency of the wires to form discontinuities in the structure , as shown in the hrtem image in figure 5 a ) .",
    "clear stripes are sometimes observed across the wire bundles , which arise from from stacking faults which appear during the growth process .",
    "indeed such compositional ordering has been recently theoretically predicted@xcite .",
    "hrtem diffraction analysis shows that the structure of the wire is identical on both sides of the fault , but clearly continuity is broken at these points .",
    "sections in between the faults may thus act as qdots , leading to the ecb behaviour we observe . considering that the distance between faults may be a few tens of nanometers , the comparison of qdot capacitance with the static capacitance calculated in the previous paragraph suggests this effect may also be important .",
    "one of our objectives has been to determine how imperfect , bent and deformed mosi wires might behave in molecular - scale circuits such as may form upon self - assembly@xcite .",
    "it is clear from the present experiments that quantum transport dominates their behaviour .",
    "the tll model with its characteristic data collapse of the @xmath29 characteristics at different temperatures appears to hold well for a significant proportion of the thin wire circuits . at the same time",
    "clear signatures of the ecb predicted j - shaped @xmath29 curves are also occasionally observed .",
    "discontinuities in the wires either as a result of bending , and/or structural stacking faults within the wire are believed to cause the formation of qdots , which lead to the occasional occurrence of ecb behaviour .",
    "the diameter of the present mosi wire bundles is small enough to allow covalent s bonding to individual molecules@xcite , so for the construction of molecular scale circuits , where thin and relatively short wires are of interest , they may potentially revolutionize molecular electronics .",
    "a point of interest is the possibility of making variable sizes of qdots with mosi wires by stretching them over appropriately sized regular topological features to produce arrays of qdots .",
    "the other possibility of creating single qdots by using the tip of an atomic force microscope , was already recently demonstrated @xcite .",
