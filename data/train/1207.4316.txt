    "correlation functions of gauge invariant local operators are the natural observables of any conformal field theory . over the last few years , there has been rapid progress in the understanding / computation of correlations functions of @xmath3 sym , see for instance @xcite , and now explicit results , that would be impossible to obtain by standard feynman diagram techniques , are available .    given an @xmath4point correlation function @xmath5 an interesting limit to consider is the one where consecutive ( after choosing a specific ordering ) distances became null @xmath6 , at equal rate .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that in such a limit one obtains    @xmath7 \\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 $ ] is a wilson loop in the adjoint representation , over the null polygonal path @xmath9 , with cusps at @xmath10 .",
    "this relation is quite general and does not require the theory to be planar .",
    "if we focus on a planar theory , as we will do in this paper , then @xmath11 \\rangle = \\langle w_{\\text{fund}}^n[{\\cal c } ] \\rangle^2 $ ] , the square of a wilson loop in the standard fundamental representation .",
    "one can also consider a generalization of the above limit , in which all distances but one became null .",
    "it was argued in @xcite , see also @xcite , that in this limit one obtains    @xmath12 { \\cal o}(y )    \\rangle } { \\langle w^n_{\\text{adj}}[{\\cal c}]]\\rangle}\\ .\\ ] ]    on the right hand side we obtain the correlation function of a null wilson loop with a local operator .",
    "this is a very interesting class of objects , in particular , they interpolate between a wilson loop and a correlation function , and they are finite , since uv divergences in the numerator and denominator cancel out . the planar limit of a wilson loop with operator insertions was discussed in detail in @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath13 { \\cal o}(y ) \\rangle \\rightarrow 2 \\langle w_{\\text{fund}}^n[{\\cal c } ] \\rangle   \\langle w^n_{\\text{fund}}[{\\cal c } ] { \\cal o}(y ) \\rangle $ ] .",
    "hence , in the planar limit    @xmath14 { \\cal o}(y ) \\rangle } { \\langle w^n_{\\text{fund}}[{\\cal c}]]\\rangle}\\ ] ]    in this paper we will focus on the simplest case , where the polygonal null wilson loop has four edges , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 . in this case",
    "conformal symmetry implies :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the cross - ratio that can be constructed out of the location of the local operator @xmath18 and the location of the cusps @xmath10 :    @xmath19    hence @xmath20 is a function of a single variable @xmath17 , in addition to the coupling constant @xmath21 . from the definition of the cross - ratio and cyclic symmetry of the location of the cusps , we expect @xmath20 to have `` crossing '' symmetry :    @xmath22    for the case of @xmath23 , the operator that couples to the dilaton ( i.e. the @xmath3 action ) , this function was computed in @xcite at leading order both in the weak and strong coupling expansions , with @xmath24 . in the appendix",
    "we show that @xmath25 in order for ( [ integratedf ] ) to be satisfied . as for the weak coupling result ,",
    "one is to set @xmath26 in @xcite , and further multiply by @xmath27 , since @xcite used a non - standard convention for traces in the fundamental representation . ]",
    "@xmath28    we can see that both expressions satisfy the crossing symmetry ( [ crossing ] ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compute @xmath20 to higher orders in perturbation theory .    a related quantity ,",
    "namely the four - point correlation function of the stress - tensor multiplet , has been extensively studied in the past as well as more recently and has now been explicitly computed at the integrand level to 6 loops  @xcite .",
    "this multiplet , in particular , contains the chiral lagrangian of @xmath29 sym .",
    "computations of the correlator have made extensive use of the method of langrangian insertions .",
    "this method relies on the observation that derivatives with respect to the coupling constant of any correlation function can be expressed in terms of a correlation function involving an additional insertion of the @xmath3 sym action .",
    "for instance ,",
    "@xmath30    this method is very powerful : by successive differentiation with respect to the coupling , it allows one to express the @xmath31loop correction for the four - point correlation in terms of the integrated tree - level correlation function with @xmath32 additional insertions of the @xmath3 sym lagrangian .    from the discussion above it is clear that a particular limit of those integrands will produce the integrands for @xmath33 in the particular null limit we are interested in",
    "this will give integrand expressions for loop corrections to @xmath34 .",
    "in the next section we start by writing down those integral expressions",
    ". then we compute the one - loop correction to @xmath20 ( proportional to @xmath35 ) and show that the two - loop correction ( proportional to @xmath36 ) is finite .",
    "this is to be expected , but it is far from obvious from the integral expressions , since each integral diverges as @xmath37 in dimensional - regularization .    before proceeding , let us finish with a brief comment .",
    "the insertion procedure in particular implies an integral constraint on @xmath20 , namely    @xmath38    one can check that this equation is indeed satisfied by the leading results at weak and at strong coupling , and we do so in the appendix .",
    "following @xcite we introduce    @xmath39    here @xmath40 is a grassmann variable , @xmath41 is the lowest component of the stress - tensor multiplet and @xmath42 is the component proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "we define the thooft coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "the object we want to compute is then simply given by @xmath45 expressions for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( in terms of certain functions to be defined bellow ) , can be found in @xcite . in general , those depend on the insertion points , together with certain auxiliary harmonic variables @xmath48 . in the null limit considered in this paper , however , the dependence on the harmonic variables factors out , and goes away when taking the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) . in the null limit",
    "we obtain    @xmath49    which is consistent with the insertion formula @xmath50 finally we also need expressions for the @xmath51 functions .",
    "these have a remarkably simple form  @xcite . at @xmath52 loops",
    "these are given by are multiplied by the overall factor @xmath53 compared to the definition in  @xcite . ] @xmath54 these functions satisfy certain symmetries .",
    "upon multiplication by the product of all external kinematic invariants @xmath53 and for generic ( non - null - separated ) points , these functions are completely symmetric under interchange of any two points and can be written as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a homogeneous polynomial in @xmath57 of uniform weight @xmath58 at each point .",
    "these properties hold at all loops in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "when taking the null limit the functions @xmath59 will have fewer terms , but some symmetries will be lost .",
    "let us now consider the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) order by order in perturbation theory    @xmath60 \\ + \\    a^2 \\,\\bigg[{g_{5;1}^{(1)}\\over g_4^{(0)}}-{g_{5;1}^{(0)}\\over      g_4^{(0)}}{g_{4}^{(1)}\\over g_4^{(0)}}\\bigg]\\notag \\\\    & + a^3 \\,\\bigg[{g_{5;1}^{(2)}\\over g_4^{(0)}}-{g_{5;1}^{(1)}\\over      g_4^{(0)}}{g_{4}^{(1)}\\over g_4^{(0)}}-{g_{5;1}^{(0)}\\over      g_4^{(0)}}{g_{4}^{(2)}\\over g_4^{(0)}}+{g_{5;1}^{(0)}\\over      g_4^{(0)}}\\left({g_{4}^{(1)}\\over g_4^{(0)}}\\right)^2\\bigg]+\\dots \\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , at leading order in perturbation theory ( proportional to @xmath61 ) we find    @xmath62    which precisely agrees with the leading order result found in @xcite .",

    "the explicit expression for the box functions can be found for instance in@xcite , where dimensional regularization is used . even though each box function is divergent",

    "these permutations will not always produce a different integrand ( for example @xmath82 is completely symmetric under all such permutations ) .",
    "we have divided by the corresponding symmetry factor in the definition of the integral ( see figures ) .",
    "putting this all together into  ( [ eq:4a ] ) gives @xmath83      we wish to check that the combination of ( divergent ) two - loop integrals  ( [ eq:5 ] ) is finite .",
    "to do this at the level of the integrand we have to first understand where the divergences come from , and then see if they cancel . as is well - known there are two overlapping sources of infrared divergences for massless integrals , soft ( when the internal momentum between two massless external legs vanishes ) and collinear ( when the integration momentum becomes collinear to a massless external leg )  @xcite .",
    "we make these divergences explicit in the current situation , by changing integration variables .",
    "firstly we perform a transformation and lorentz transformation to put @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "next transform to the following variables @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 thus when @xmath89 we have @xmath90 collinear with @xmath91 whereas when @xmath92 we have @xmath93 , so that the collinear and soft singularities occur when @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "similarly for @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 . making this change of variables , and focusing only on the potential divergences as @xmath99 , a generic two - loop integral takes the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 and where the numerator term is generically 4th order in @xmath102 .",
    "so for example for the two loop ladder diagram we have @xmath103 where in defining the integrand we always sum over permutations of the integration variables , giving the two terms here .",
    "we then see that the integral diverges as @xmath104 where to get the second line we use that @xmath105 an approximation we can make , since there are poles in @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we thus see the expected @xmath106 divergence of the two - loop ladder .    now , before addressing the case of interest , we consider another interesting two - loop integral , namely the logarithm of the amplitude at 2-loops . we know that this has a reduced infrared divergence , and it is interesting to see how this manifests itself at the level of the integrand . again , performing the change of variables above we find that the numerator for the log of the amplitude takes the form @xmath107 notice that this vanishes in any collinear ( @xmath108 ) or soft ( @xmath109 ) limit in distinction with the ladder diagram alone above .",
    "this shows that it must have a reduced divergence compared to the ladder diagram .",
    "indeed this simple fact ( that the numerator vanishes when the loop integration becomes collinear with a massless external momentum ) was used to great effect recently for determining high - loop four - point amplitudes  @xcite and correlation functions  @xcite . here",
    "we go slightly further and consider the exact degree of divergence in this case .    implementing the change of integration variables , the log of the amplitude takes the form @xmath110 to see the degree of divergence in this integral ,",
    "it is useful to change variable once more , and let @xmath111 , @xmath112",
    ". then the potential divergences occur at @xmath113 ( also when @xmath114 but we have symmetrized the integration variables , allowing us to concentrate on the former case ) . in these variables , from  ( [ eq:6 ] ) @xmath115 then one can see there are no singularities when @xmath116 ( unlike in the two - loop ladder case ) , and so the log of the amplitude takes the form @xmath117 and we identify the @xmath118 divergence .    finally then , we consider the case of interest , the two - loop integral defined in  ( [ eq:5 ] ) . making the change of variables we find that this time the numerator is of degree 6 in the @xmath119 variables , in particular @xmath120 for some finite @xmath121 .",
    "let us then consider the degree of divergence of such an integral . plugging into  ( [ eq:7 ] ) and changing to the @xmath122 variables the numerator @xmath123 and",
    "there are then no poles at all as @xmath124 and thus the integral is completely finite there .    while perhaps not a completely rigorous proof of finiteness , the above argument gives a strong indication that the above integral is finite .",
    "furthermore it provides an integrand - level criterion for obtaining finite integrals : they must have numerators of the form form  ( [ eq:2 ] ) . indeed implementing this criterion on an arbitrary linear combination of the integrals @xmath125",
    "gives the unique solution  ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we considered the correlation function of a local operator ( the @xmath3 lagrangian ) with a four cusped null wilson loop @xmath126 in perturbation theory .",
    "this correlation function is expected to be finite , and conformal symmetry implies that the non - trivial dependence is encoded in a function @xmath20 of a single cross - ratio and the coupling constant . by using previous results on correlation functions , we computed @xmath20 at one - loop in perturbation theory , obtaining    @xmath127    our result is consistent with crossing - symmetry @xmath128 and furthermore has the expected degree of transcendentality . furthermore",
    ", we have given an integral representation for the two - loop contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "this is given in terms of seven integrals , including double boxes and pentaboxes , plus permutations . even though each contribution diverges as @xmath129 in dimensional regularization",
    ", we argue that this particular combination is finite . this claim is also supported by a numerical analysis of the integrals .",
    "we hope to come back in the future with a more detailed analysis , and hopefully an analytic answer , of the two - loop result .",
    "finally , let us mention that the computation of @xmath20 should be simpler in certain limits .",
    "for instance , if the insertion point is null separated to one of the cusps ( but not to the other ) @xmath17 vanishes ( or becomes infinity ) , hence it should be possible to understand this limit in terms of the light - cone ope for correlation functions .",
    "we hope to go back to this question in the future .",

    "this is the usual massless scalar box function , and it has been computed in dimensional regularization , for instance , in @xcite . at leading order in @xmath134",
    "we obtain                where the world - sheet corresponds ends on the regular polygon with four edges .",
