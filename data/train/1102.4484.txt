    "the subject of this paper is a self - consistent theory of specific soliton states that were originally predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and reportedly observed experimentally.@xcite without any doubt , these states can be regarded as a hallmark of two - band superconductivity in mesoscopic doubly - connected samples .",
    "indeed , owing to the emergence of additional degrees of freedom of the order parameter , the nomenclature of topological objects in multiband superconductors is much richer than that in conventional single - band superconductors . in particular , ginzburg - landau equations describing two - band superconductivity in bulk samples admit topologically stable solutions ( with one - dimensional singularities of the order parameter ) that can be interpreted as vortices carrying fractional magnetic flux.@xcite in the absence of any interband coupling , these vortices are accompanied by a circulating neutral superfow associated with gradients of the interband phase difference . in the presence of `` josephson - type '' interband coupling , the neutral superflow generates static solitons of the sine - gordon type .",
    "in contrast to traditional abrikosov vortices in type - ii superconductors , the energy per unit length of these composite topological defects diverges at spatial infinity : hence they are thermodynamically metastable and difficult to create in bulk samples .",
    "however , solitons of the interband phase difference can exist by themselves in doubly - connected mesoscopic samples , when the formation of any magnetic vortices in the volume of the superconductor is prohibited energetically.@xcite moreover , soliton states in this case can be induced by an externally applied magnetic field , which makes them a convenient object of investigation .",
    "thus , experimental studies@xcite of the magnetic response of mesoscopic two - band superconducting rings reveal certain nontrivial features that , according to the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , can be attributed to the creation of metastable soliton states .",
    "our research is largely motivated by the absence in current literature of any quantitative theoretical analysis of this pronounced feature of two - band superconductivity .",
    "( unfortunately , the arguments of ref . @xcite and of the recent publications@xcite are mostly heuristic by nature . )",
    "mathematically , the approach of this paper is based on a ginzburg - landau - type theory , which is a commonplace in theoretical studies of topological defects in two - band superconductors : see the next section .",
    "this means , of course , that we are restricted to the temperature range@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the critical temperature of the superconducting transition .    ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 obey conditions ( [ 1.3])-([1.6]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as to the physical object , we consider a two - band superconductor in the form of a straight , circular thin - walled cylinder , whose symmetry axis is the @xmath7 axis of cylindrical coordinates @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the constant external magnetic field @xmath9 is applied along the symmetry axis : @xmath10 .",
    "the length of the generatrix of the wall of the cylinder satisfies the condition@xmath11 which allows us to neglect end effects . the wall thickness @xmath12 and the average radius of the cylinder @xmath5 satisfy the following conditions:@xmath13@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the `` coherence lengths '' in bands 1 and 2 , respectively , and @xmath19 is the weak - field penetration depth .",
    "exact definitions of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 will be given in the next section ; however , the role of conditions ( [ 1.3])- ( [ 1.6 ] ) should be explained right now .",
    "thus , condition ( [ 1.3 ] ) precludes the formation of any magnetic vortices in the wall of the cylinder .",
    "condition ( [ 1.4 ] ) mainly simplifies mathematical consideration .",
    "in contrast , a combination of conditions ( [ 1.5 ] ) and ( [ 1.6 ] ) is of primary importance : taken together , these two conditions guarantee that self - induced magnetic fields are small and can be treated perturbatively .",
    "( this fact justifies the definition `` mesoscopic cylinders '' in the title of the paper . ) moreover , as will be shown , the dimensionless quantity @xmath20 serves as a natural expansion parameter of the gibbs free energy . in order to carry out a rigorous analysis of thermodynamic stability of soliton states",
    ", we will have to evaluate the gibbs free energy _",
    "exactly _ up to small terms of order @xmath21 , which implies the necessity of self - consistent evaluation of the vector potential up to first - order terms in @xmath20 .",
    "we conclude the formulation of the problem by specifying boundary conditions for soliton states .",

    "it should be emphasized that there are _ no _ a priori reasons for setting @xmath31.@xcite as in the case of fractional magnetic vortices in bulk two - band superconductors,@xcite nontrivial topological states arise when @xmath32 . in the presence of interband coupling , they are of the soliton type .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the gibbs free - energy functional of the system and analyze its basic properties . in section iii , we derive a self - consistent expression for the electromagnetic gibbs free energy .",
