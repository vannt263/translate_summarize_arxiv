    "the pair correlation is one of the fundamental nucleon many - body correlations , which governs many aspects of the nuclear structure@xcite .",
    "recently attentions are paid to the properties of the pair correlation in neutron - rich nuclei , which exhibit new features such as the neutron halo , the neutron skin and the presence of weakly bound neutrons .",
    "for example , a spatial two - neutron correlation or the di - neutron correlation , between two weakly - bound neutrons forming the halo in @xmath3li and @xmath4he has been discussed extensively @xcite , and its experimental signatures are reported recently @xcite .",
    "there exists also several theoretical studies demonstrating similar spatial two - neutron correlation in many other nuclear systems .",
    "the spatial two - particle correlation was originally discussed in the closed - shell + two - particle systems @xcite , and recent selfconsistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field calculations suggest that the correlation is generically enhanced around the nuclear surface of neutron - rich nuclei covering also medium- and heavy - mass regions @xcite . furthermore it is found that neutron matter at low densities may exhibit features of the strong coupling pairing@xcite , characterized by the small size ( @xmath5 fm at minimum ) of the cooper pair comparable with the average inter - neutron distance @xcite , reflecting the large scattering length @xmath6fm of the bare nuclear force .",
    "this may also suggest a possible enhancement of the pair correlation in the surface and exterior regions of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the spatial two - neutron correlation and the surface enhancement of the neutron pairing is also discussed in the cases of a slab and a semi - infinite nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "also the pairing interaction induced by the coupling to the phonons is expected to increase the surface enhancement@xcite .",
    "it is important to ask how one can probe the surface enhancement of the pair correlation in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we consider here the transfer of a neutron pair since the matrix element of the pair transfer has direct relation to the degree of the pair correlation@xcite .",
    "recently the neutron pair transfer process in light neutron - rich nuclei @xmath3li and @xmath7he has been studied experimentally @xcite . in the theoretical side ,",
    "a possible link between the pair transfer between the @xmath8 ground states and the surface enhancement of the pairing in medium and heavy neutron - rich nuclei was suggested by dobaczewski _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "recently the pair transfer feeding the excited @xmath8 states in neutron - rich nuclei has been investigated @xcite from the viewpoint of the pair vibrational mode , which are collective vibrational modes associated with the pair correlation@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite has argued that the pair transfer can be a possible probe of different models of the pairing interactions with differences in density dependence and surface enhancement .    in the present work , we shed light on the neutron pair transfer with the _ quadrupole _",
    "multipolarity@xcite , i.e . , the transitions from the ground state of a nucleus with neutron number @xmath9 feeding excited @xmath10 states , in particular the first @xmath10 state , in the neighboring @xmath11 isotopes .",
    "it is noted that the first @xmath10 state in open shell nuclei is a collective state of the surface vibrational type with a strong influence by the pair correlation@xcite . with this surface character of the mode",
    ", we expect that the pair transfer feeding the @xmath12 state may provide information on the pair correlation possibly enhanced in the surface and exterior regions of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the low - lying quadrupole vibration is revealed recently to show new features in some neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "for instance , the ratio between the neutron and proton amplitude becomes significantly different from the liquid drop ratio @xmath13@xcite .",
    "new aspects of the quadrupole vibration may emerge also in the pair transfer transitions feeding the @xmath10 states . in our previous studies on the dipole and octupole responses",
    ", we have shown that soft modes accompanying a large pair transition amplitude in the surface and exterior regions emerge above the threshold energy in nuclei with small neutron separation energy@xcite .",
    "we also found that these soft dipole and octupole modes are sensitive to the surface - enhancement of the pair correlation .",
    "the low - lying quadrupole vibration is different from these soft modes in many respects : it exists systematically from stable nuclei to nuclei far from the stability line , and the excitation energy is located below the separation energy in most of the cases . nevertheless , as we shall show below , the low - lying quadrupole mode also has sensitivity to the surface pair correlation .",
    "the sensitivity is systematically seen in the pair - addition transfer feeding the lowest - lying quadrupole state , and it becomes significant in neutron - rich nuclei beyond the shell closure , i.e. in sn isotopes with @xmath1 .",
    "we shall perform systematic numerical study by adopting the sn isotopes as a representative case since its long isotopic chain enables us to see systematic trends .",
    "in particular we focus on isotopes beyond the @xmath14 shell gap , above which the neutron separation energy suddenly decreases .",
    "our study is based on the skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field theory in describing the pair correlated ground state , and the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa)@xcite ( and references in @xcite ) to describe the @xmath10 states and the associated pair transfer modes . in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on the nuclear structure aspects , and leave the cross section and the reaction mechanism of the neutron pair transfer@xcite for future works .",
    "the formalism is described in section 2 .",
    "to elucidate effects of the surface - enhanced pairing , we compare different models of the effective pairing interaction , which have and do not have the property of the surface enhancement . after presenting",
    "the adopted effective pairing interactions in section 3 , we discuss numerical results in section 4 , and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",

    "we recapitulate it briefly in order to explain the procedure to describe the pair transfer modes .    in performing the hfb calculation",
    ", we assume the spherical symmetry for the ground state and the associated mean - fields . the skyrme energy density functional ( the energy density functional associated with the skyrme interaction ) is adopted to derive the hartree - fock potential and the position - dependent effective mass@xcite .",
    "the parameter set sly4 is adopted@xcite . as the residual interaction responsible for the pairing correlation we use the density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) @xcite @xmath15 where the the pairing interaction strength @xmath16 is a function of the neutron and proton densities @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and",
    "hence it depends on the position @xmath19 .",
    "we solve the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equation in the radial coordinate space to obtain the wave functions of the quasiparticle states .",
    "we assume the box boundary condition at @xmath20 with @xmath21 fm .",
    "we truncate the quasiparticle states by the maximum quasiparticle energy @xmath22 mev .",
    "we also truncate the quasiparticle states by the maximum orbital angular quantum number @xmath23 , which is sufficiently large to obtain the converged hfb solutions of the sn isotopes .",
    "the qrpa calculation is then performed on the basis of the self - consistent hfb mean - fields .",
    "as the residual interaction in the particle - particle channel , we adopt the dddi , eq .",
    "( [ dddi ] ) , the same effective pairing interaction used for the hfb calculation .",
    "concerning the residual interaction in the particle - hole channel , we derive it also from the skyrme functional used for the hfb calculation , but we apply the landau - migdal approximation to the residual interaction@xcite .",
    "namely , we approximate the particle - hole residual interaction by a position - dependent contact interaction @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the landau - migdal parameters derived from the skyrme functional . the position dependence is taken into account in the landau parameters by the local density approximation to the fermi momentum . as a prescription commonly adopted in the qrpa studies using the landau - migdal approximation@xcite",

    "however this parameter set leads to neutron pairing gaps in sn isotopes which are systematically smaller than the empirical values estimated from the odd - even mass difference using the three - point formula@xcite .",
    "we therefore vary @xmath108 and fix to @xmath101 so as to reproduce the empirical gap in @xmath115sn@xcite while keeping the scattering length relevant to the low - density limit .",

    "the density - independent delta interaction is often called the volume pairing interaction@xcite .",

    "it is pointed out in the literature@xcite that the surface enhancement of the pairing interaction influences the average paring gap only to a small extent unless one sees the trend in a very wide range of mass@xcite , and the difference may grow only in very neutron - rich nuclei close to the drip - line@xcite . on the other hand",

    "spatial extension is hardly seen in the pair - addition transition density , and the transition densities is mostly concentrated in the internal and surface region @xmath187 fm @xmath188 fm .",
    "the spatial extension emerges suddenly at @xmath176 . comparing the pair - addition transition density in @xmath189sn ( the largest one in fig.[fig : transitiondensity](b ) ) with that in @xmath178sn ( the third largest one among the solid curves in fig.[fig : transitiondensity](a ) ) , the maximum amplitude is almost the same , but the pair - addition strength @xmath168 in @xmath178sn ( @xmath190 ) is about twice as large as that in @xmath189sn ( @xmath191 ) because of the spatial extension in @xmath178sn .",
    "the sudden change across the @xmath14 shell closure may be ascribed to the fact that the isotopes with @xmath154 have a feature of weakly bound nuclei although they are located far from the neutron drip - line .",
    "the calculated one - neutron separation energy suddenly change from @xmath192 mev in @xmath177sn to @xmath193 mev in @xmath98sn .",
    "this arises from the shell gap at @xmath14 and from the fact that the neutron single - particle orbits @xmath194 and @xmath195 lying above the @xmath14 shell gap are bound only weakly ( the hartree - fock single - particle energies in @xmath177sn are @xmath196 mev and @xmath197 mev ) .",
    "these orbits have significantly small binding energies compared with the orbit @xmath198 just below the shell gap ( @xmath199 mev ) .",
    "since the quadrupole pair - addition mode in @xmath177sn and heavier isotopes necessarily contain two - quasiparticle components consisting of these weakly bound orbits , the pair - addition transition density should inherit the long tail arising from the weak binding .",
    "in particular , approaching @xmath129sn and @xmath180sn , neutrons start to occupy the @xmath195 orbit which has a very small binding energy .",
    "we remark that the closing of shells has a strong influence on the pair transfer in general@xcite .",
    "for instance , the neutron shell is closed at @xmath176 ( @xmath14 ) and the calculated neutron pairing gap vanishes there . in this case , the qrpa equation ( [ rpa ] ) is decomposed into the particle - hole , the particle - particle , and the hole - hole sectors .",
    "the pair - addition mode in @xmath177sn belongs to the particle - particle sector , and the lowest - lying qrpa solution in this sector has a character of a correlated pair of neutrons built upon the @xmath177sn core .",
    "it is nothing but the quadrupole pair vibrational mode in closed shell nuclei , and in this case a large collectivity in the pair - addition mode is known , with a typical example of @xmath200pb@xcite .",
    "this is , however , only one of the mechanisms of the large pair - addition strength @xmath168 seen at @xmath176 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we note that the strength in @xmath177sn for the dddi - bare interaction is more than twice larger than that in @xmath201sn ( another shell closure at @xmath202 ) , and this relative enhancement at @xmath177sn is a consequence of the characteristic spatial extension of the transition density in the isotopes beyond the @xmath14 shell closure .",
    "figure  [ fig : pairstrength ] ( b ) shows the systematics of the pair - removal strength @xmath169 for transition from the ground state of an isotope @xmath203 to the @xmath0 state in the isotope @xmath204 .",
    "it is seen that the pair - removal strength is generally small , compared with the pair - addition strength .",
    "another trend seen here is that the pair - removal strength is very small at the beginning of shells ( at @xmath205 ) and of a subshell ( at @xmath206 ) ; it takes a value comparable with the pair - addition strength @xmath168 around the mid - shell ( @xmath207 ) , and it is relatively large at @xmath208 because of the shell closures at @xmath202 and @xmath14 in parallel to the situation in @xmath200pb.@xcite    figure  [ fig : transitiondensity](c ) displays the pair - removal transition densities @xmath166 associated with the @xmath0 mode in the isotopes from @xmath115sn ( located in the middle of the shell ) to @xmath177sn ( at the end of the shell ) .",
    "it is seen that the transition densities @xmath166 of the pair - removal mode in these isotopes does not exhibit the spatial extension toward the outside , rather it is concentrated only around and inside the surface region @xmath209 fm @xmath210 fm .",
    "this feature originates from the fact that the pair - removal transition consists mainly of the obits situated near the fermi energy and those bound more deeply . in the isotopes with @xmath211 , these are strongly bound orbits with the binding energy @xmath212 mev ( e.g , @xmath199 mev in @xmath177sn ) and they do not have tails extending far outside the nuclear surface .",

    "fig.[fig : dddi ] ) . in the case of @xmath98sn",
    "we see a large difference in the quadrupole pair - addition strength in @xmath98sn while in the case of @xmath115sn the difference is small .",
    "a systematic comparison is made in fig.[fig : pairstrength ] for the pair - addition and -removal strengths @xmath168 and @xmath169 of the @xmath0 mode calculated with the three kinds of the pairing interactions , including the mix pairing as well .",
    "it is seen that the pair - addition strength exhibits a sensitivity in all the nuclei to some extent , and the sensitivity becomes prominent in @xmath181sn .",
    "the ratio of @xmath168 obtained with the dddi - bare and that with the volume pairing is 2.3 , 2.8 , 4.0 , 3.5 , 2.8 for @xmath213,136,138 , 140 , 142 , respectively , while for @xmath214 it is in the range 1.4 - 2.0 .",
    "note , on the other hand , that the pair - removal strength @xmath169 is much less sensitive in all the isotopes .",
    "the difference in @xmath169 for the different pairing interactions is negligible in many isotopes .",
    "let us analyze the mechanism of the sensitivity of the pair - addition strength by looking into the transition densities .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionint ] ( a)-(c ) the transition density @xmath160 of the pair - addition mode calculated with different pairing interactions in the three representative sn isotopes . in this figure",
    "we see an intimate relation between the degree of sensitivity and the radial profile of the transition density .",
    "namely a large sensitivity observed in @xmath98sn and @xmath180sn can be linked to the pair - addition transition density extending far outside the nuclear surface , @xmath215fm .",
    "the sensitivity is small in @xmath115sn where the transition density is confined mostly within the surface region @xmath209fm .    for more detailed discussion let us examine the values of the pair - addition transition density @xmath160 in @xmath98sn at @xmath216 fm , corresponding approximately to the half density radius @xmath217 ( @xmath218 fm ) , and @xmath219 fm , and @xmath220 fm .",
    "the ratio of @xmath160 obtained with the dddi - bare and that with the volume pairing is 1.45 , 1.82 and 2.71 for @xmath216 fm , respectively , indicating an increase of the sensitivity as moving from the surface toward the outside .",
    "it is also useful to compare @xmath160 with the transition density @xmath221 associated with the unperturbed pair - addition transfer ( i.e. the transition associated with the lowest - energy two - quasiparticle excitation obtained by neglecting the residual pairing interaction ) , which is also shown in fig.[fig : transitionint ] with the dotted curve .",
    "the ratio between the transition density @xmath160 obtained with the dddi - bare ( or the volume pairing ) and the unperturbed transition density @xmath221 is a measure of the influence of the rpa correlation ( the configuration mixing ) caused by the residual pairing interaction . in the case of the dddi - bare , the ratio @xmath222 reads 2.7 at the nuclear surface @xmath223 , and it increases to 3.8 - 6.2 at @xmath224 .",
    "this is in contrast to the volume pairing causing much smaller ratio 1.9 - 2.1 - 2.3 at the same positions .",
    "we see even stronger sensitivity to the density - dependence of the pair interaction in @xmath180sn , for which the tail extends further outside .",
    "we thus see that the strong sensitivity of the pair - addition transfer originates from the rpa correlation taking place in the surface and exterior regions in @xmath98sn and @xmath180sn .",
    "we recall the reader here that the three pairing interactions have interaction strengths different by a factor of more than 2 ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : dddi ] ) at the positions @xmath215 fm corresponding to low densities @xmath225 .    a contrasting case is @xmath115sn shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionint](c ) , in which we see very little the rpa correlation effect and the difference between the dddi - bare and the volume pairing interactions .",
    "this is what we can expect from the discussions above as there is essentially no significant spatial extension of the pair - addition transition density in this tightly bound stable isotope , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionint](c ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionint](d ) we show the transition density @xmath166 of the pair - removal mode in @xmath177sn . in this case",
    "the pair - removal amplitude is concentrated only in the vicinity and the inside of the surface @xmath209 fm , exhibiting a very different radial profile from that of the pair - addition mode in @xmath226sn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionint](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "it is also seen that the pair - removal transition density @xmath166 does not depend on which we adopt the dddi - bare or the volume pairing .",
    "we can interpret this insensitivity in terms of fig .",
    "[ fig : dddi ] : the effective pairing strengths of the three interactions are comparable in size on average in the region @xmath227 fm where the transition strength is concentrated .",
    "finally we remark that the three pairing interactions give essentially identical results for @xmath133 and @xmath144 except for @xmath228 , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : exstrength ] ( a ) and ( b ) . the excitation energy and the @xmath144 of the @xmath0 state in superfluid nuclei",
    "is known to depend on the pairing correlation@xcite .",
    "however , the results indicate that these quantities are not influenced very much by the density - dependence of the pairing interaction as far as the average pairing gap is constrained to the same value .",
    "we have investigated the neutron pair transfer modes with the quadrupole multipolarity feeding the low - lying quadrupole states in the neutron - rich sn isotopes by means of the qrpa based on the skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - fields . as a model of the surface - enhanced paring",
    ", we used the density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) whose strength increases at low nucleon densities reflecting the large scattering length of the @xmath106 bare interaction in the free space .",
    "the numerical calculations indicate that the lowest - lying quadrupole state exhibits a sudden change of its character as the neutron number increases across the magic number @xmath14 , beyond which features of weakly binding emerge in the neutron motion .",
    "the most noticeable feature is found in the pair - addition mode .",
    "namely the transition density of the pair - addition mode feeding the @xmath0 state extends spatially far outside the nuclear surface with a long tail reaching @xmath2 fm in the isotopes @xmath229sn .",
    "accordingly the strength of the quadrupole neutron pair - addition transition is enhanced for @xmath154 .",
    "the enhanced pair - addition transfer is a consequence of the rpa correlation caused by the pairing interaction acting strongly in the surface and external regions of a nucleus .",
    "comparing with other dddi s having different density dependence , i.e. the density - independent volume pairing and the mixed pairing having an intermediate density dependence , it is found that the quadrupole pair - addition mode exhibits generally sensitivity to the increase of the pairing interaction strength in the surface and the external regions of a nucleus .",
    "the sensitivity of the pair - addition mode to the three interactions is about a factor of 1.4 - 2.0 in the isotopes with @xmath151 , and it is magnified to a factor of 2.0 - 4.0 in the isotopes @xmath154 . therefore one can expect that the neutron pair - addition transfer feeding the @xmath0 state in the neighboring @xmath230 isotope , especially those feeding the isotopes @xmath231 , provides a probe to the enhancement of the pairing interaction strength expected in the surface and the external regions . on the other hand , the neutron pair - removal transfer feeding the @xmath0 state in the @xmath204 isotope does not have the sensitivity , and neither @xmath135 nor the quadrupole neutron strength @xmath232 does , as far as the sn isotopes analyzed in the present work are concerned .",
