    "the matrices of the third and fourth term can be multiplied , leading to @xmath84 hence , the friedel sum is given by @xmath85 which has been applied in the past to substitutional @xcite and interstitial @xcite alloys .",
    "in this section a single @xmath2 or @xmath3 impurity is considered embedded in unperturbed al host .",
    "this means that the charge transfer to the surrounding host atoms as well as lattice distortion are neglected .",
    "furthermore , an impurity atom has an assumed electronic configuration , which in reality may depend on its metallic environment . from fig .",
    "[ fig : impinal ] , in which the calculated impurity resistivities are shown , it is clear that this configuration is very important .",

    "the impurity resisitivity of atoms having two @xmath86 electrons decreases with increasing atomic number , while it shows a maximum for mn , when only one @xmath86 electron is present .",
    "the experimental values @xcite , indicated in the figure by asterisks , also show such a maximum , but the values are underestimated by the calculations .",
    "the potentials used in the calculations just described do not lead to a charge neutral system , which is unphysical .",
    "the neutrality can be restored by adding a surface charge to the atomic spheres .",
    "@xcite this procedure is called the shifting procedure , because it corresponds to a shift of the atomic potential by a constant energy .",
    "the charge of the system is calculated using the generalized friedel sum expression given in sec .",
    "[ sec : restheory ] . this procedure has been applied to the transition metal impurities with the @xmath87 electronic configuration , the ca(@xmath88 ) and the @xmath3 impurities .",
    "the impurity resistivities , obtained with these potentials , are given by open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : impinal ] .",
    "the addition of charge leads to an increase of the resistivity in all cases , except for sc , ge and as .",
    "the agreement with the experimental values becomes much better .",
    "for all @xmath3 impurities and for the transition metal impurities with more than six @xmath2 electrons the agreement is very good .",
    "the addition of surface charge is a crude attempt to simulate the effect of charge relaxation in the alloy .",
    "still , in the case of the @xmath2 impurities fe , co and ni it enhances the accuracy of the resistivity significantly .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for the other @xmath2 impurities .",
    "apparently , the surface charge does not simulate all effects of charge relaxation in the right way",
    ". therefore it would be very interesting to repeat the calculations for sc , ti , v , cr and mn with self - consistently calculated potentials .",
    "the method of calculation of the resistivity is not affected by the use of such potentials .",
    "the resistivities of these impurities in al were already calculated by boerrigter _",
    "@xcite , schpke and mrosan @xcite and recently by papanikolaou _",
    "schpke and mrosan @xcite used the spherical band approximation , which means that the fermi surface is approximated by a sphere .",
    "they found resistivities , which were approximately equal to the ones following from the well - known free - electron formula of friedel @xcite , which only contains the scattering phase shifts .",
    "just as the other authors mentioned they found an underestimation of the resistivities , which was attributed to the anisotropy of the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite tried to incorporate these anisotropy effects in a tricky way and found values for the @xmath2 impurities , which were too large . in our calculation",
    "this anisotropy is fully and consistently taken into account , but still the impurity resistivities are underestimated .      according to our calculation the resistivity of a vacancy in al is 0.57 @xmath89 .",
    "we used host phase shifts for all surrounding al atoms . in first order",
    "the resistivity is the sum of the resistivities of the separate scatterers .",
    "therefore it is likely that the vacancy resistivity is underestimated . in the present case account of the scattering by the first shell enlarges the resistivity only slightly , to 0.60 @xmath89 .",
    "our value contradicts with earlier calculations of van ek _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who found 0.93 @xmath89 .",
    "the vacancy resistivity is also extracted from simultaneous measurements of the resistivity and the expansion of both the total volume and the lattice constant in an al sample @xcite . in this way a value of 3.0 @xmath89 is found , which is much larger than the value we found .",
    "this could have several reasons .",
    "one of the reasons can be that the electronic structure of the vacancy defect is not calculated self - consistently . from the previous subsection indeed a strong dependence on the electronic structure was observed .",
    "another reason may be that the volume expansion is not entirely due to the absorption of vacancies or that the enlargement of the resistivity is not merely due to the presence of vacancies .    during a jump",
    "the resistivity changes from the initial value , via the value at the saddle point , back to the initial value .",
    "the saddle point value depends also on the direction of the jump with respect to the direction of the current . in the calculation a single saddle point atom",
    "is taken into account , so scattering by the two small moon - shaped vacancies next to the atom is neglected .",
    "this procedure leads to a resistivity which is smaller than the one of the vacancy for all directions of the current , namely @xmath90 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 both have the value of @xmath93 .",
    "the resistivities for the different directions are defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : jfcc ] .",
    "it is expected that the small vacancies contribute considerably to the resistivity , leading to a value , which is larger than the vacancy resistivity .",
    "calculations for a pair of vacancies show that the resistivity , averaged over all current directions , is equal to the resistivity of two single vacancies .",
    "perhaps a larger cluster of perturbed host atoms or self - consistently calculated phase shifts could alter this conclusion .",
    "the symmetry of a pair is the same as the symmetry of an atom at the saddle point .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : jfcc ] ) holds .",
    "the parallel resistivity @xmath94 turns out to be 0.94 @xmath89 , which is considerably smaller than the resistivity in the other two directions ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "the much smaller resistivity of a pair of vacancies aligned along the current is easily explained intuitively with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig : twovac ] . assuming a monotonic relation between the geometrical and scattering cross - sections , the scattering cross - section is obviously larger when the pair of vacancies is aligned perpendicular to the current .",
    "however , from the results for impurity - vacancy pairs , to be presented below , it follows that this intuitive , classical explanation does no justice to the quantummechanical character of the scattering process .",
    "microscopically , one has to consider the scattering probability due to a pair of potentials @xmath97 and @xmath98 , lying at a distance * r * , which , of course , is not simply equal to the sum of the individual probabilities too . even in lowest order in the potential , this probability @xmath9 , calculated in the free electron model ,",
    "so using plane waves , is proportional to @xmath99 in which @xmath100 is a real quantity for a spherical potential in free space . for a pair of vacancies @xmath101 .",
    "it is clear that the cosine term does not have a definite sign , and that the contribution will be different for different alignments of * r*. our results for the pair of vacancies imply , that the average contribution of this term is positive for * r * perpendicular to the current , and negative for alignment along the current . for large values of * r",
    "* this term will average out , and the individual probabilities just add .",
    "the experimentally obtained resistivities of the @xmath102 impurities in ag @xcite have already been used in the analysis of their wind valence by dekker _",
    "et al . _ @xcite . in this section",
    "the impurity resistivities will be calculated for a single impurity , one next to a vacancy and one at the saddle point during a diffusion jump . in most of the calculations",
    "the perturbation of the surrounding host atoms is not taken into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5spsubs ] it is seen that the calculations , indicated by filled circles , and the measurements , indicated by asterisks , show the same trend .",
    "however the measured values are larger .",
    "only the value of 1.18 @xmath89 for the @xmath103 impurity pd is an overestimation .",
    "a much lower value of 0.02 @xmath89 is found , when a @xmath104 electronic configuration is used for the pd atom .",
    "the experimental value of 0.44 @xmath89 lies between the two theoretical values , which suggests that the electronic configuration is a mixture of both .",

    "[ fig:5spsubs ] . just like in the case of impurities in al",
    "the resistivities are enlarged .",

    "the impurity potential @xmath98 is certainly attractive , which corresponds to an overall negative sign , and a vacancy potential @xmath97 is repulsive .",
    "so , on the average , the cosine term in eq .",
    "( [ propfree ] ) has the opposite sign compared with the scattering by two vacancies .",
    "this implies a conversion of the behavior , in agreement with or finding for the impurity - vacancy pair .",

    "the calculated resistivities due to the @xmath102 impurities in ag show a similar dependence on atomic number as the experimental values .",
    "@xcite just as for impurities in al the resitivities are underestimated . however , after achieving charge neutrality by adding a surface charge to the impurity , they become too large .",
    "the resistivity due to an impurity - vacancy pair is smaller than the sum of the impurity and vacancy resistivities . when the pair is aligned with the current , the resistivity is largest and approximately equals that sum .",
    "the fact that the resistivity is largest in that direction is in contradiction with the smaller geometrical cross - section .",
    "an impurity halfway its jump path has a larger resistivity than the impurity - vacancy pair in spite of the neglected small vacancies .",
    "the calculated resistivities of the impurities cr and ta in the bcc transition metal v agree fairly well with experiment , while the one of ti is underestimated .",
    "the values for a @xmath114 impurity - vacancy pair and an impurity halfway its jump path are larger than the ones for a single impurity .    in conclusion , it has been shown that the resistivity due to low - symmetrical defects can be calculated accurately .",
    "the calculated impurity resistivities compare reasonably well with the available experimental material .",
    "they may even improve when self - consistent potentials for the alloy are used .",
