    "the perfection of the function in thaddeus paper was suggested by the work of frankel @xcite while the perfection of ours is suggested by duistermaat s paper @xcite .    for technical reasons , in this paper we will only take up the case of genus two @xmath14curves , hoping to address the case of higher genera elsewhere . for @xmath14curves of genus two ,",
    "the second author @xcite described @xmath15 algebraically as the intersection of two quadrics in the five  dimensional real projective space ; however , it proved to be rather difficult to extract any further information about the topology of @xmath15 from that description .",
    "the morse theoretic approach of this paper , on the other hand , gives a complete calculation of the integral cohomology of @xmath15 .",

    "it should be mentioned that the above isomorphism does not hold at the level of cohomology rings , see remark [ r : rings ] .",
