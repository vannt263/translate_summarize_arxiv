    "in this appendix we describe the theory behind our fiber - optical analogue of the event horizon @xcite . after a brief summary of nonlinear fiber optics",
    "we show how an optical pulse establishes a moving medium and how this medium corresponds to a space - time geometry .",
    "this point of view is relatively unusual in the fiber optics community , but , as we demonstrate , it is completely consistent with the established knowledge of this field @xcite .",
    "we then take advantage of our approach in quantizing the electromagnetic field of a probe in the presence of a pulse .",
    "we describe the classical and quantum physics of fiber - optical horizons , explaining the classical frequency shifting and the quantum hawking effect with as few assumptions on the physics and the prior knowledge of the reader as possible without going into excessive detail .",
    "optical fibers @xcite are metamaterials  materials with optical properties that are dominated by their structure  for the following reason : an optical fiber confines light to narrow transversal regions , usually at the core of the fiber . the electromagnetic field in the transversal plane depends on the frequency and polarization of the light in relation to the transversal structure of the fiber . in this way",
    "@xcite , the waveguide gives rise to an effective dispersion @xcite and birefringence @xcite that supersedes the natural optical dispersion of silica glass .",
    "the confinement of the light in the fiber also enhances the intensity over the fiber length such that the natural optical nonlinearity of glass becomes relevant , in particular the kerr and raman nonlinearity caused , respectively , by the electronic and molecular optical response of glass @xcite . for making artificial event horizons",
    ", one can exploit the custom - designed dispersion and birefringence and the enhanced nonlinearity of optical fibers , in particular of microstructured fibers ( also called photonic - crystal fibers ) @xcite .",
    "let us first describe the optical properties of glass . in the laboratory frame",
    ", @xmath0 describes the position in cartesian coordinates and @xmath1 the time .",
    "we use the operator @xmath2 to denote spatial derivatives and @xmath3 for time derivatives .",
    "we characterize the intrinsic linear optical response of the glass fiber by the susceptibility profile @xmath4 and denote the nonlinear polarization vector of the medium by @xmath5 .",
    "the vector @xmath6 of the electric field strength obeys the wave equation @xcite in si units , @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the electric permeability of the vacuum .",
    "we assume a lossless medium where @xmath9 is real .",
    "in isotropic materials such as glass , no second - order nonlinearity exists on symmetry grounds @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order nonlinearity is proportional to the response from the products of three electric - field components .",
    "such an effect , called kerr nonlinearity @xcite is generated by the electronic excitations of glass on a time scale comparable to the atomic size divided by the speed of light .",
    "assuming instantaneous response , the nonlinear polarization is proportional to a cubic form of the field strength .",
    "the effect of optical nonlinearities strongly depends on the frequency matching of the field components involved @xcite .",
    "consider instead of the full electric field @xmath6 either the positive or negative frequency component oscillating in the optical spectral range . to keep the notation simple",
    ", we describe these components by the symbol @xmath6 as well .",
    "the nonlinear polarization of the medium is only effective if @xmath5 oscillates in a similar spectral range as one of the frequency components of @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , @xmath5 combines two electric - field components @xmath10 and one complex conjugate @xmath11 . in isotropic materials such as glass , @xmath5",
    "is further restricted : isotropy implies for the @xmath5 components @xcite @xmath12 where the @xmath13 denote the material constants of the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "they correspond to the @xmath14 coefficients in nonlinear optics @xcite . in silica ,",
    "the @xmath13 constants are identical , to a very good approximation , @xmath15 in fibers @xcite , the electric field has two transversal components that we denote by @xmath16 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : kerrpol ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa ] ) give @xmath17 the first term describes the self phase modulation , the second term the cross phase modulation and the third usually is called four wave mixing @xcite .",
    "the self phase modulation does not act across polarizations , whereas the other two terms correspond to polarization interactions .",
    "for equally polarized fields that carry two distinct frequency bands , the kerr effect acts across these frequencies , because , writing @xmath18 we obtain @xmath19 the contribution proportional to @xmath20 or @xmath21 is also called cross phase modulation @xcite .",
    "we see that the coupling strength of the cross phase modulation between polarizations is @xmath22 of the self phase modulation and the cross phase modulation within one polarization is twice as strong as the self phase modulation @xcite .",
    "another cubic nonlinear effect caused by molecular excitations with longer response time , called stimulated raman scattering @xcite , contributes to the material polarization for pulses below @xmath23 duration .",
    "stimulated raman scattering is important for forming the shape of ultrashort pulses @xcite , but , it does not act across polarizations nor significantly different frequency bands , the cases we are interested in ; hence we ignore the raman effect here .",
    "consider the effect of the waveguide on the light confined in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 direction and propagating along the fiber in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "we assume that the fiber is homogeneous in @xmath26 and infinitely long , with the fourier - transformed susceptibility @xmath27 we represent the fourier - transformed field strengths as @xmath28 and require that the fiber modes @xmath29 are eigenfunctions of the transversal part of the wave equation for monochromatic light with eigenvalues @xmath30 , @xmath31 for single - mode fibers @xcite , only one eigenvalue @xmath32 exists for each optical polarization @xmath16 and frequency @xmath33 ( within a limited frequency range ) .",
    "we normalize the mode functions @xmath29 such that the integral of @xmath34 over the @xmath35 plane is unity .",
    "the optical nonlinearity acts predominantly within a narrow spatial region near the fiber core at @xmath36 . therefore ,",
    "we obtain , to a very good approximation , @xmath37 e_\\pm = \\frac{\\partial_t^2 p_\\pm}{\\varepsilon_0 c^2}\\ ] ] with the nonlinear polarization ( [ eq : pol ] ) .",
    "here we understand @xmath13 as being averaged over the transversal modes ( usually causing almost no difference between the two optical polarizations @xmath16 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath30 of the transversal modes set the effective refractive indices @xmath38 of the fiber for light pulses @xmath39 defined by the relation @xmath40 as a well - known consequence of causality @xcite the refractive index must be analytic on the upper half plane of complex @xmath33 . in the absence of losses within the frequency range we are considering ,",
    "the fourier - transformed @xmath41 in the longitudinal mode equation ( [ eq : upm ] ) is real on the real axis and the longitudinal mode equation ( [ eq : upm ] ) is hermitian and positive .",
    "consequently , @xmath38 is real on the real axis .",
    "furthermore , since the linear susceptibility @xmath42 is real , @xmath41 must be an even function of @xmath33 , which implies that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are even functions of the frequency @xmath33 .",
    "when the dielectric structure of the fiber varies over the scale of an optical wavelength , the polarization of light becomes an important issue and the refractive indices differ for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , causing birefingence @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , microstructured or photonic - crystal fibers @xcite allow for some freedom in tailoring the dispersion , nonlinearity , and birefringence for specific applications .      in our case",
    ", an intense ultrashort optical pulse interacts with a weak probe field .",
    "this probe may be caused by an incident continuous wave of light or by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field itself @xcite .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations are carried by modes that behave as weak classical light fields as well .",
    "the pulse is polarized along one of the eigen - polarizations of the fiber ; the probe field may be co- or cross polarized . due to",
    "stimulated raman scattering @xcite or the formation of optical shocks @xcite the pulse will change its shape and velocity ; but we assume that the intensity profile @xmath47 of the pulse uniformly moves with constant velocity @xmath48 during the interaction with the probe . since the probe field is weak or in the vacuum state we can safely neglect the backaction onto the pulse and the nonlinear self interaction of the probe . since the intensity profile of the pulse",
    "is assumed to be fixed and given , we focus attention on the probe field .",
    "we describe the probe by the corresponding component @xmath49 of the vector potential that generates the electric field @xmath50 and the magnetic field @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the probe field obeys the wave equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the susceptibility due to the kerr effect of the pulse on the probe .",
    "we take the @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) that corresponds to the probe polarization and denote the effective refractive index by @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : wave0 ] ) shows that the pulse indeed establishes an effective moving medium @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous @xcite to use as coordinates the retarded time @xmath57 and the propagation time @xmath58 defined as @xmath59 because in this case the properties of the effective medium depend only on @xmath57 . here",

    "( 1 ) of our paper @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : frame ] ) does not describe a lorentz transformation , but the @xmath57 and @xmath58 are of course perfectly valid coordinates ; they simply do not belong to an inertial system .",
    "assume , for simplicity , a dispersionless case where the refractive index @xmath56 of the probe does not depend on the frequency .",
    "note that a horizon inevitably violates this condition , because here light comes to a standstill , oscillating at increasingly shorter wavelenghts the closer it approaches the horizon .",
    "light waves are dramatically frequency shifted and thus leave any dispersionless frequency window . however , many of the essentials of horizons are still captured within the simplified dispersionless model .",
    "first , we can cast the wave equation ( [ eq : wave ] ) in a relativistic form , introducing a relativistic notation @xcite for the coordinates and their derivatives @xmath67 and the matrix @xmath68 that resembles the inverse metric tensor of waves in moving fluids @xcite . adopting these definitions and",

    "the effective metric tensor @xmath70 is the inverse of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath72 in subluminal regions where the velocity @xmath73 of the probe light exceeds the speed of the effective medium , _",
    "i.e. _ the velocity @xmath48 of the pulse , the measure of time @xmath74 in the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) is negative . here",
    "both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are timelike vectors @xcite . in superluminal regions , however , @xmath73 is reduced such that @xmath74 is positive .",
    "a horizon , where time stands still , is established where the velocity of light matches the speed of the pulse .",
    "the theory of quantum fields at horizons @xcite predicts the spontaneous generation of particles . in our case ,",
    "the quantum field is light in dielectric media .",
    "the quantum theory of light in media at rest has reached a significant level of sophistication @xcite , because it forms the foundation of quantum optics and , in particular , the quantum theory of optical instruments @xcite , but quantum light in moving media is much less studied @xcite . in optical fibers ,",
    "light is subject to dispersion , which represents experimental opportunities on one side , but poses a theoretical challenge on the other : we should quantize a field described by a classical wave equation of high order in the retarded time .",
    "moreover , strictly speaking , dispersion is always accompanied by dissipation , which results in additional quantum fluctuations @xcite . here",
    ", however , we assume to operate in frequency windows where the absorption is very small .",
    "we entirely focus on the dispersive properties of the fibre . to deduce the starting point of the theory , we begin with the dispersionless case in classical optics and then proceed to consider optical dispersion for light quanta .",

    "since the field equation is linear and classical , we represent @xmath85 as a superposition of a complete set of classical modes multiplied by quantum amplitudes @xmath90 .",

    "the scalar product serves to identify the quantum amplitudes @xmath90 and @xmath98 : the amplitude @xmath90 belongs to modes @xmath92 with positive norm , whereas the hermitian conjugate @xmath98 is the quantum amplitude to modes @xmath99 with negative norm , because @xmath100 using the orthonormality relations ( [ eq : on ] ) we can express the mode operators @xmath90 and @xmath98 as projections of the quantum field @xmath85 onto the modes @xmath92 and @xmath99 with respect to the scalar product ( [ eq : scalar ] ) , @xmath101 we obtain from the fundamental commutator ( [ eq : comm ] ) and the orthonormality relations ( [ eq : on ] ) of the modes the bose commutation relations @xmath102 = \\delta_{kk ' } \\,,\\quad [ \\hat{a}_k,\\hat{a}_{k ' } ] = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] which justifies the choice of the prefactor in the scalar product ( [ eq : scalar ] ) . in agreement with the spin - statistics theorem @xcite ,",

    "the modes with positive norm select the annihilation operators of a quantum field , whereas the negative norm modes pick out the creation operators .",
    "in other words , the norm of the modes determines the particle aspects of the quantum field . in the unruh effect @xcite , modes with positive norm in the minkowski space - time consist of superpositions of positive and negative norm modes in the frame of an accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "consequently , the minkowski vacuum is not the vacuum as seen in the accelerated frame .",
    "instead , the accelerated observer perceives the minkowski vacuum as thermal radiation @xcite . in the hawking effect @xcite",
    ", the scattering of light at the event horizon turns out to mix positive and negative norm modes , giving rise to hawking radiation .      a moving dielectric medium with constant refractive index but nonuniform velocity appears to light exactly as an effective space - time geometry @xcite .",

    "the dispersion relation has two sets of solutions describing waves that are co- or counter - propagating with the pulse in the laboratory frame .",
    "counter - propagating waves will experience the pulse as a tiny transient change of the refractive index , whereas co - propagating modes may be profoundly affected .",
    "consider the solution @xmath113 in this case , we obtain outside of the pulse in the laboratory frame @xmath114 , which describes light propagating in the positive @xmath26 direction .",

    "we also see that @xmath33 is the frequency of light in the laboratory frame , whereas @xmath115 is the frequency in the frame co - moving with the pulse .",
    "equation ( [ eq : doppler ] ) describes how the laboratory - frame and the co - moving frequencies are connected due to the doppler effect .    in order to find the evolution of the amplitude @xmath108 , we substitute in the exact scalar product ( [ eq : scalar ] ) the approximation ( [ eq : go ] ) with the phase ( [ eq : phase ] ) and the dispersion relation ( [ eq : doppler ] ) . in the limit @xmath116",

    "@xcite we notice that @xmath122 plays the role of the conjugate momentum here .",
    "therefore , we obtain hamilton s equations with a different sign than usual @xcite , @xmath123 we express @xmath124 in terms of the group index in the laboratory frame . here",
    "the group velocity @xmath125 is the derivative of the frequency @xmath33 with respect to the wave number @xmath126 or , equivalently , the inverse of the derivative of @xmath126 with respect to @xmath33 , which gives for the group index @xmath127 the standard expression @xcite @xmath128 we obtain from the first of hamilton s equations ( [ eq : he ] ) and the doppler formula ( [ eq : doppler ] ) @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the difference between the group velocity of the probe @xmath125 and the pulse speed @xmath48 .",
