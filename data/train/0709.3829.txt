    "whereas many physical properties were measured and analyzed for cubic trialuminides , thermal expansion and magnetostriction data for these materials , in particular at low temperatures , appear to be absent from the literature ( except for an early report @xcite on the thermal expansion of lual@xmath0 and ybal@xmath0 between @xmath6 k and @xmath7 k ) .",
    "in addition , for tmal@xmath0 the exact crystal electric field ( cef ) splitting of the hund s rule , ground state multiplet has remained unresolved @xcite , in part due to a lack of high temperature and high magnetic field specific heat data . in this work",
    "we report extensive measurements of specific heat as well as thermal expansion and magnetostriction data for ral@xmath0 ( r = tm , yb , lu ) single crystals so as to compare with other salient physical properties and to inquire into the effects of the cef and intermediate valence ( iv ) on these characteristics .",

    "sometimes , in the analysis of experimental data , lacking the temperature - dependent compressibility data , the temperature dependence of the grneisen parameter can be approximated @xcite as being proportional to @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 for cubic materials ) under the assumption that the relative temperature dependence of @xmath27 is significantly smaller then that of thermal expansion coefficient or heat capacity .",
    "we will adopt such approach in this work .    if more than one contribution to the thermodynamic properties is present ( e.g. vibrational , electronic , magnetic , etc . ) , the grneisen parameters are not additive , rather the grneisen parameter for the material is an average , weighted by the heat capacity contribution of each component @xcite : @xmath36 .",
