    "the increasing use of engineered nanomaterials ( enm ) in hundreds of consumer products has recently raised concern about their potential effect on the environment and human health in particular . in nanotoxicology , in vitro dose - escalation assays describe how cell lines or simple organisms are affected by increased exposure to nanoparticles .",
    "these assays help determine materials and exposure levels .",
    "standard dose - escalation studies are sometimes completed by more general exposure escalation protocols , where a biological outcome is measured against both increasing concentrations and durations of exposure .",
    "cost and timing issues usually only allow for a small number of nanoparticles to be comprehensively screened in any study . therefore",
    ", both one- and two - dimensional escalation experiments are often characterized by small sample sizes .",
    "furthermore , data exhibits natural clusters related to varying levels of nanoparticles bio - activity .",
    "the two case studies presented in section  [ sectionappli ] provide an overview of the structure of typical data sets obtained with both experimental protocols .    beyond dose - response analysis ,",
    "nanomaterial libraries are also designed to investigate how a range of physical and chemical properties ( size , shape , composition , surface characteristics ) may influence enm s interactions with biological systems .",
    "the nano - informatics literature reports several quantitative structure  activity relationship ( qsar ) models .",
    "this exercise is conceived as a framework for predictive toxicology , under the assumption that nanoparticles with similar properties are likely to have similar effects .",
    "most of existing qsar models summarize or integrate experimental data across times , doses and replicates as a preprocessing step , before applying traditional data mining or statistical algorithms for regression .",
    "for example , @xcite use a modified student s @xmath0-statistic to discretize outputs in two classes ( toxic or nontoxic ) and a logistic regression model to relate toxicity to physico - chemical variables .",
    "@xcite use the area under the dose - response curve as a global summary of toxicity and they model dependence on predictors via a regression tree . both approaches , while reasonably sensible , ignore the uncertainty associated with data summaries and can lead to unwarranted conclusions as well as unnecessary loss of information .",
    "@xcite summarize toxicity profiles using a new definition of toxicity , called _ the probability of toxicity _ , which is defined as a linear function of nanoparticle physical and chemical properties .",
    "while this last approach solves the issue of uncertainty propagation , it still makes it impossible to predict full dose - response curves from nanoparticle characteristics .",
    "moreover , the use of regression trees is inherently appealing , as they are able to model nonlinear effects and interactions without compromising interpretation .",
    "we aim to extend regression tree models to account for structured multivariate outcomes , defined as toxicity profiles of nanoparticles , measured over a general exposure escalation domain .",
    "multivariate extensions of the regression tree methodology have been proposed by @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the original tree - building algorithm of @xcite is modified to handle multivariate responses for commonly used covariance matrices , such as independence or autoregressive structures .",
    "@xcite proposes a similar method for an independent covariance structure .",
    "@xcite develop regression tree models for functional data , by representing each individual response as a linear combination of spline basis functions and using the estimated splines coefficients in multivariate regression trees .",
    "an alternative for longitudinal responses consists of combining a tree model and a linear model : @xcite replace the fixed effects of the traditional linear mixed effects model by a regression tree .",
    "the linear random effects are unchanged .",
    "@xcite fit a semi - parametric model , containing a linear part and a tree part , for multivariate outcomes in genetics .",
    "the linear part is used to model main effects of some genetic or environmental exposures .",
    "the nonparametric tree part approximates the joint effect of these exposures .",
    "finally , @xcite develop regression tree models for longitudinal data with time - dependent covariates . in this",
    "setting , measures for the same individual can belong to different terminal nodes .",
    "other extensions of standard regression trees include bayesian approaches , where tree parameters become random variables .",
    "@xcite introduce a bayesian regression tree model for univariate responses .",
    "the method is based on a prior distribution and a metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm which generates candidate trees and identifies the most promising ones .",
    "this methodology has since been extended to so - called _ treed _ models , where a parametric model is fitted in each terminal node [ @xcite ] , to a sum - of - trees model [ @xcite ] , and to incorporate spatial random effects for merging data sets [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite model nonstationary spatial data by combining bayesian regression trees and gaussian processes in the leaves .",
    "this approach is extended to the multivariate gaussian process with separable covariance structure in @xcite .",
    "building on previous contributions , we propose a new method to analyze the relationship between nanoparticles physico - chemical properties and their toxicity in exposure escalation experiments .",
    "we extend the bayesian methodology of @xcite to allow for dose- and time - response kinetics in terminal nodes .",
    "our work is closely related to the methodology introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , our model is specifically adapted to exposure escalation experiments , as observations for the same nanoparticle at different doses and times can not fall in separate leaves of the tree .",
    "therefore , the binary splits of the tree only capture structure activity relationships instead of the general increase of toxicity with exposure .",
    "a global covariance structure accounts for correlation between measurements at different doses and times for the same nanoparticle .",
    "our approach is able to model nonlinear effects and potential interactions of physico - chemical properties without making parametric assumptions about toxicity profiles .",
    "it also addresses the issues associated with conventional qsar models by combining evidence across measurements for all doses and times in a general experimental design .",
    "the proposed model is particularly versatile , as it provides scores of importance for physico - chemical properties and visual assessment of the marginal effect of these properties on toxicity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sectionmodel ] describes the regression model for dose - response data and section  [ sectionprior ] describes the corresponding prior model . the resulting posterior distribution and the associated mcmc algorithm are presented in section  [ sectionalgo ] .",
    "the model is extended to the case of dose- and time - response surfaces in section  [ sectiongeneralcase ] .",
    "the method is applied to a library of 24 metal oxides in section  [ sectionappli ] and section  [ sectiondiscu ] concludes this paper with a discussion .",
    "we first consider the case of a typical dose escalation experiment , where a biological outcome is measured over a protocol of increased nanoparticle concentration .",
    "this case will be expanded in section  [ sectiongeneralcase ] to include more general exposure escalation designs .",
    "let @xmath1 denote a real - valued response associated with exposure to nanoparticle @xmath2 and replicate @xmath3 at dose @xmath4 , for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 has been appropriately normalized and purified of experimental artifacts .",
    "for the two case studies of section  [ sectionappli ] , normalization was performed for each tray by subtracting a baseline mean response , measured in control wells where cells were not exposed to any nanoparticle .",
    "after normalization , we indeed assume independence between wells exposed to different nanomaterials on the same tray .",
    "current experimental protocols only allow for the observation of the outcome @xmath8 as it varies in association with a discrete prescription of dose - escalation .",
    "however , for notational convenience and without loss of generality , we maintain that @xmath8 shall be observed for any dose level @xmath4 ranging from no exposure @xmath9 to a maximal nanoparticle concentration level @xmath10 .",
    "let also @xmath11 be a @xmath12-dimensional vector of continuous physico - chemical characteristics or predictors associated to nanoparticle @xmath2 .",
    "we assume @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a random mean function , depending on the dose level @xmath4 and nanoparticle characteristics @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath14 is defined by a regression tree @xmath17 on the predictor space and a functional model for dose - response curves in the terminal nodes of @xmath17 .",
    "full details about the proposed mean structure are described in the following section .",
    "given @xmath14 , we assume that outcomes are independent across nanoparticles and , for any nanoparticle @xmath2 , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 $ ] . in this",
    "setting , two outcomes associated with the same nanoparticle at similar doses are assumed to be more correlated than measurements taken at distant doses , for any replicate .",
    "the major advantage of this assumption is related to a reduced representation of a high - dimensional covariance matrix , which is now fully characterized in terms of a @xmath20-dimensional variance parameter @xmath21 and a @xmath20-dimensional correlation  @xmath22 .",
    "the binary tree @xmath17 recursively splits the predictor space into two subspaces , according to criteria of the form @xmath23 vs @xmath24 , for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "each split defines two new nodes of the tree , corresponding to two newly created subspaces of predictors .",
    "let @xmath27 be the set of terminal nodes of tree @xmath17 .",
    "we model the dose - response curves in each terminal node as a linear combination of spline basis functions .",
    "unlike parametric models such as log - logistic , spline functions do not assume a particular shape for the curve .",
    "this makes our model fully applicable to sub - lethal biological assays , which are not expected to follow a sigmoidal dose - response dynamic .",
    "however , if needed , the spline model can easily allow for possible shape constraints , such as monotonicity , by using a modified basis [ @xcite ] .",
    "this flexibility makes the use of spline basis representations potentially preferable to gaussian process priors or similar smoothers .",
    "a formal comparison is , however , outside the scope of this manuscript .",
    "our chosen functional representation is easily extended to two - dimensional response surfaces ( section  [ sectiongeneralcase ] ) .",
    "let @xmath28 denote @xmath29 uniform b - spline basis functions of order @xmath30 on @xmath31 $ ] , with @xmath32 fixed knots .",
    "following @xcite , we avoid choosing the location of spline interior knots by deliberately overfitting curves with a number of knots coinciding with the dose - escalation grid .",
    "adaptive smoothness is determined by using a penalty on adjacent coefficients , via a smoothing prior that will be presented in section  [ sectionprior ] .    if @xmath15 is in the subset corresponding to the @xmath33th terminal node of @xmath17 , @xmath34 .",
    "we will denote with @xmath35 the vector of splines coefficients defining the expected dose - response trajectory in the @xmath33th terminal node .",
    "furthermore , we let @xmath36 define the random set of spline coefficients , including @xmath37 from all terminal nodes @xmath38 . the bayesian model is completed by prior distributions on @xmath17 , @xmath39 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we first introduce the general dependence structure of the prior , before describing each parameter s prior distribution .",
    "we follow @xcite , and assume that the tree is independent of variance components @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath40 moreover , conditionally on @xmath17 , terminal node parameters are assumed independent : @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the prior is fully determined by a tree prior @xmath42 , terminal node parameters priors @xmath43 , and variance parameters priors @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the tree prior @xmath42 is implicitly described by the stochastic tree - generating process of @xcite , where each new tree is generated according to the following : ( i ) the probability for a node at depth @xmath46 to be nonterminal , given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , ( ii ) the probability for a node to split at a predictor @xmath49 , @xmath50 , given by the discrete uniform distribution on the set of available predictors , and ( iii ) given the predictor @xmath49 , the probability for a node to split at a value @xmath51 , given by the discrete uniform distribution on the set of available splitting values .",
    "probability ( i ) is a decreasing function of @xmath46 , making deeper nodes less likely to split and favoring `` bushy '' trees . @xcite",
    "give guidelines to choose parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 by plotting the marginal prior distribution of the number of terminal nodes . in ( ii ) and ( iii ) , predictors and splits are available if they lead to nonempty child nodes .",
    "we follow @xcite and consider a conditionally conjugate p - spline prior : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an additional smoothing variance parameter and @xmath56 is a penalty matrix of size @xmath57 , corresponding to a first order random walk . note",
    "that this prior is improper , as the matrix @xmath58 is not of full rank . in order to work with a proper prior in a model comparison setting ,",
    "we replace the first and last element of the diagonal with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a small constant . the model is completed by assigning a conjugate inverse  gamma hyperprior to the smoothing parameter @xmath61 .",
    "we assume @xmath62 . for @xmath22",
    ", we choose the conjugate prior described by @xcite for autoregressive covariance matrices , with truncated support on @xmath63 $ ] .",

    "this last distribution completes the prior model .",
    "we now turn to posterior inference on parameters , given the observations .",
    "we are interested in the posterior distribution @xmath74 .",
    "the rest of this section describes a markov chain monte carlo algorithm for sampling from this distribution , as the number of potential trees prevents direct calculations .",
    "our gibbs sampler is adapted from the algorithms of @xcite and @xcite , with changes due to the specific structure of our model .    at each iteration ,",
    "the algorithm performs a joint update of @xmath75 , conditionally on the rest of the parameters , followed by standard gibbs component - wise updates of each variance parameter .",
    "the joint tree and terminal nodes spline coefficients update is decomposed into @xmath76    the draw of @xmath17 in ( [ eqtr ] ) is performed by the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm of @xcite , which simulates a markov chain of trees that converges to the posterior distribution @xmath77 .",
    "the proposal density suggests a new tree based on four moves : grow a terminal node , prune a pair of terminal nodes , change the split rule of an internal node , and swap the splits of an internal node and one of its children s .",
    "the target distribution can be decomposed as follows : @xmath78\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & & \\qquad \\propto p({\\mathcal{t } } ) \\int p \\bigl(\\mathbf{y } { |}\\bolds{\\beta } , { \\mathcal{t } } , \\sigma^2 , \\varphi_d , \\tau^2 \\bigr ) p \\bigl ( \\bolds{\\beta } { |}{\\mathcal{t } } , \\sigma^2 , \\varphi_d , \\tau^2 \\bigr ) \\,d \\bolds{\\beta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression for the integral above is given in @xcite , in a closed form by conjugacy of the prior on @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the draw of @xmath17 in  ( [ eqtr ] ) does not require a reversible - jump procedure for spaces of varying dimensions , even if nodes are added or deleted . the proposal density of the metropolis ",

    "we perform two series of posterior predictive checks : in the first one , the generated predictive samples are conditioned on the full set of dose - response curves , via the tree .",
    "the objective is to assess model adequacy and calibration .",
    "the second series studies model prediction accuracy using a leave - a - curve - out validation scheme , where each data curve is compared to the corresponding predictive sample obtained by fitting the tree on the remaining curves .",
    "posterior inference based on monte carlo samples is also used to derive inferential summaries about nontrivial functionals of the parameter / model space .",
    "the marginal effect of a physico - chemical property @xmath89 on the response can be represented by the partial dependence function of @xcite : let @xmath90 be a grid of new values for @xmath89 .",

    "monte carlo integration over the model space provides straightforward inference on nontrivial functionals of parameters of interest and prediction of full dose - response curves from nanoparticle characteristics .",

    "this issue is not specific to our model and possible improvements would be obtained by combining multiple studies in a meta - analysis framework , with the appropriate adjustments for data heterogeneity or formalizing explicit prior knowledge about hazardous nanoparticle properties . as seen in the case study for cell death and cellular membrane permeability , different toxicity mechanisms can be closely related .",
    "therefore , an important opportunity for model extensions would be to combine different biological assays in a single analysis , the final goal being that of understanding if nanoparticles physical and chemical properties have a differential effect on different cellular injury pathways .",
