    "the following is a brief description of fredholm operators . for more details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a bounded operator @xmath0 on a separable hilbert space is _ fredholm _ if there exists a bounded operator @xmath1 such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are compact .",
    "the fredholm index is defined by @xmath4    the simplest example of a fredholm operator with nonzero index is the unilateral shift operator : let @xmath5 be the canonical basis for the hilbert space @xmath6 , and let the operator @xmath7 act by @xmath8 the reason for denoting the unilateral shift operator by @xmath7 is its similarity to the harmonic oscillator lowering operator .",
    "the adjoint of @xmath7 acts by @xmath9 since @xmath10 , @xmath7 is fredholm .",
    "the kernel of @xmath7 is 1-dimensional and the kernel of @xmath11 is 0-dimensional .",
    "thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "although neither the dimension of @xmath14 nor that of @xmath15 is stable under deformations of @xmath0 , the index _ is _ stable . for any compact operator @xmath16 , for any bounded operator @xmath1 , and for @xmath17 sufficiently small , @xcite : @xmath18",
    "the following theorem is standard :    if @xmath19 are fredholm operators , then the product @xmath20 is also fredholm , and @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath22 are fredholm operators on the same hilbert space , then there is a continuous path of fredholm operators from @xmath0 to @xmath22 if and only if @xmath23 .",
    "( by continuous , we mean relative to the operator norm ) .",
    "put another way , the path components of @xmath24 , the space of fredholm operators on @xmath25 , are indexed by the integers .",
    "the @xmath26-th path component is precisely the set of fredholm operators of index @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "our main concern in this paper is the following problem : suppose one interpolates between fredholm operators with different indices .",
    "what can one say about the way the indices change ?",
    "another way of phrasing this is : what is the phase diagram of fredholm indices ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on the choice of the embedding space . in the space of bounded operators ,",
    "the `` phases''each labeled by its index  are open sets .",
    "but the boundary between phases , as we shall explain , is rather wild : a point on the boundary of one phase is also on the boundary of _ every other _ phase .",
    "this behavior is difficult to visualize .",
    "another class of embedding spaces that we consider is associated with toeplitz operators with various regularity assumptions on a class of functions . here , at least if the functions are sufficiently smooth , the boundaries between phases have a simple structure and the phase diagrams satisfy simple rules that have the flavor of gibbs phase rule @xcite .",
    "typical of our results is the statement that under appropriate conditions , phases whose indices differ by one have a common boundary whose codimension is one , and phases whose indices differ by two meet on a set of codimension two etc .",
    "fig.[shifts ] is an example of one of the phase diagrams we obtain .",
    "theories of the quantum hall effect are roughly of two kinds : those that focus on the bulk of the hall and those that focus on the edge @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that the bulk - edge duality is an illustration of the _ holographic principle_. in either approach , the quantized hall conductance can be related to a fredholm index .",
    "it is common knowledge that the hall conductance can be identified with a chern number @xcite . for non - interacting electrons in two dimensions ,",
    "this result is a special case of the fact that the hall conductance is a fredholm index .",
    "since this is not common knowledge , we recall how chern numbers and fredholm indices are related .    for non - interacting electrons in two dimensions with the fermi energy in a gap , tkn@xmath27 , showed that the hall conductance for landau hamiltonians with _ periodic _ potential , is related to a chern number @xcite .",
    "the ( magnetic ) brillouin zone associated with the periodicity plays an role in this theory . because of this , the interpretation of the hall conductance as a chern number does not carry over to random or even quasi - periodic potentials nor to `` irrational magnetic fields '' , all of which have no ( classical ) brillouin zone .",
    "although the quantization of the hall conductance can be established in these cases by a limiting argument @xcite , the interpretation as a chern number does not survive .",
    "j. bellissard @xcite , in a work that had impact on non - commutative geometry @xcite , showed that the hall conductance with _",
    "potential , be it periodic , quasi - periodic or random , and real magnetic field , rational or not , is a fredholm index .",
    "this result was derived in @xcite without using non - commutative geometry .",
    "more precisely , consider the ( infinite dimensional ) spectral projection @xmath28 on the states below the fermi energy @xmath29 for the one particle hamiltonian in the plane .",
    "let @xmath30 be the multiplication operator @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the usual polar angle in the plane .",
    "@xmath30 is a singular gauge transformation that introduces an aharonov - bohm flux tube at the origin of the euclidean plane .",
    "the hall conductance is the fredholm index of @xmath33 thought of as an operator on the range of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "since the fredholm index does not need a brillouin zone , this approach offers a natural framework that accounts for the quantization and stability of the hall conductance .",
    "finite quantum hall systems have chiral edge currents @xcite . consider the case that the boundary is a circle of circumference @xmath34 .",
    "the dispersion relation of the edge states is approximately linear in a small neighborhood of the fermi energy and the hamiltonian for a single edge channel , with velocity @xmath35 , is @xmath36 now , the projection @xmath28 is associated with the occupied edge states , @xmath37 with @xmath38 . introducing a flux tube into the system",
    "is associated with the unitary @xmath39 and sends @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to the spectral flow of the edge states .",
    "@xmath33 is the unilateral shift operator @xmath7 and the number of edge states that cross the fermi energy is @xmath41 . by an argument of halperin @xcite this is also the hall conductance .",
    "an extension of this idea to harper models with an edge is described in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the space of bounded operators with the topology defined by the operator norm , and we wish to understand the phase diagram of a generic family of such operators . as we shall explain , the phase diagram in the entire space is quite wild : any point on the boundary of the `` index = @xmath42 '' phase is also on the boundary of every other phase .    to understand this bizarre behavior ,",
    "recall that the zero operator ( which is _ not _ a fredholm operator ) is on the boundary of every phase : zero is the limit , as @xmath43 , of @xmath44 , with @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) , for any @xmath26 .",
    "the point of the theorem is that similar behavior occurs at all boundary points .",
    "let @xmath45 be the set of fredholm operators of index @xmath26 .",
    "every point on the boundary of @xmath45 is also on the boundary of @xmath46 , for every integer @xmath47 .",
    "proof : let @xmath48 be a ( not fredholm ) operator on the boundary of @xmath45 . given @xmath49",
    ", we must find an operator in @xmath46 within a distance @xmath17 of @xmath48 .",
    "suppose that the kernel and cokernel of @xmath48 are infinite dimensional , and that there is a gap in the spectrum of @xmath50 at zero .",
    "( if this is not the case , we may perturb @xmath48 by an arbitrarily small amount to make it so ) .",
    "now let @xmath1 be a unitary map from the kernel of @xmath48 to the cokernel .",
    "let @xmath51 be the orthogonal projection onto @xmath52 , and let @xmath7 be a shift operator on @xmath53 .",
    "for each @xmath54 , @xmath55 has a bounded right inverse @xmath56 it follows that the cokernel of @xmath57 is empty .",
    "it is easy to see that the kernel of @xmath57 is @xmath47 dimensional hence @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 has index @xmath60 . @xmath61",
    "in this section and the next we show that there are interesting and simple `` generic '' phase diagrams of fredholm indices in some finite dimensional spaces , and in some infinite - dimensional spaces with sufficiently fine topologies .",
    "we shall also see also how control is lost as the space is enlarged and the topology is coarsened .",
    "we begin by considering linear combinations of the shift operator @xmath7 and the identity operator 1 .",
    "that is , we consider the operator @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants .    [ 0 - 1 ] if @xmath65 , then @xmath48 is fredholm .",
    "the index of @xmath48 is 1 if @xmath66 and zero if @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 , then @xmath48 is not fredholm .    proof : first suppose @xmath69 . then @xmath48 is invertible : @xmath70 as the sum converges absolutely .",
    "thus @xmath48 has neither kernel nor cokernel , and has index zero .    if @xmath71 , then the kernel of @xmath48 is 1-dimensional , namely all multiples of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . notice how the norm of @xmath74 goes to infinity as @xmath75",
    "however , @xmath76 has no kernel , since for any unit vector @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "thus the index of @xmath48 is 1 .    if @xmath79 , then @xmath48 is at the boundary between index 1 and index 0 , and so can not be fredholm.@xmath61      next we consider linear combinations of @xmath80 up to some fixed @xmath81 .",
    "that is , we consider operators of the form @xmath82 this is closely related to the polynomial @xmath83    if none of the roots of @xmath84 lie on the unit circle , then @xmath48 is fredholm , and the index of @xmath48 equals the number of roots of @xmath84 _ inside _ the unit circle , counted with multiplicity . if any of the roots of @xmath84 lie _ on _ the unit circle , then @xmath48 is not fredholm .",
    "proof : the polynomial @xmath85 factorizes as @xmath86 , where @xmath42 is the degree of @xmath84 ( typically @xmath87 , but it may happen that @xmath88 ) .",
    "but then @xmath89 . if none of the roots @xmath90 lie on the unit circle , then each term in the product is fredholm , so the product is fredholm , and the index of the product is the sum of the indices of the factors . by theorem [ 0 - 1 ] , this exactly equals the number of roots @xmath90 inside the unit circle .",
    "if any of the roots lie on the unit circle , then a small perturbation can push those roots in or out , yielding fredholm operators with different indices .",
    "this borderline operator therefore can not be fredholm.@xmath61    the last theorem easily generalizes to linear combination of left - shifts and right - shifts .",
    "the index of an operator @xmath91 equals the number of roots of @xmath92 inside the unit circle , minus the degree of the pole at @xmath93 ( that is @xmath47 , unless @xmath94 ) .",
    "this follow from the fact that @xmath95    since there is no qualitative difference between combinations of left - shifts and combinations of both left- and right - shifts , we restrict our attention to left - shifts only , and consider families of operators of the form ( [ a ] ) .",

    "proof : our parameter space is the space of coefficients @xmath100 , or equivalently the space of polynomials of degree @xmath101 .",
    "this is either @xmath102 or @xmath103 , depending on whether we allow real or complex coefficients . in either case ,",
    "the set @xmath104 of fredholm operators of index @xmath42 is identical to the set of polynomials with @xmath42 roots inside the unit circle and the remaining @xmath105 roots outside ( if @xmath88 , we say there is a root at infinity ; if @xmath106 , there is a double root at infinity , and so on .",
    "counting these roots at infinity , there are always exactly @xmath26 roots in all . )",

    "this is of such high codimension that it has no effect on the phase portrait we are developing . ) .",
    "we consider the common boundary of @xmath104 and @xmath107 . if @xmath108 , a nonvanishing polynomial is on the boundary of both @xmath104 and @xmath107 if it has at most @xmath42 roots inside the unit circle and at most @xmath109 roots outside .",
    "it must therefore have at least @xmath110 roots on the unit circle .",
    "if we are working with complex coefficients , this is a set of codimension @xmath110 .",
    "the roots themselves , together with an overall scale @xmath111 , can be used to parametrize the space of polynomials . for each root , being on the unit circle is codimension 1 , while being inside or outside are open conditions .",
    "since the roots are independent , placing @xmath110 roots on the unit circle is codimension @xmath110 .",
    "if we are working with real coefficients , the roots are not independent , as non - real roots come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "thus , the common boundary of @xmath104 and @xmath107 breaks into several strata , depending on how many real roots and how many complex conjugate pairs lie on the unit circle .",
    "if @xmath110 is even , the biggest stratum consists of having @xmath112 pairs , and has codimension @xmath112 .",

    "the points above the parabola @xmath117 have complex conjugate roots , while points below have real roots .",
    "notice that the transition from index 2 to index 0 occurs at an isolated point when the roots are real , but on an interval when the roots come in complex - conjugate pairs .",

    "a @xmath143 toeplitz operator @xmath133 is fredholm if and only if @xmath135 is everywhere nonzero on the unit circle . in that case",
    "the index of @xmath133 is minus the winding number of @xmath135 around the origin , namely @xmath144    given the first half of the theorem , the equality of index and winding number is easy to understand .",

    "for now we do not impose any reality constraints or other symmetries on the coefficients @xmath154 .",
    "this space of functions is a banach space , with norm given by the sup norm on the annulus .",
    "this norm is stronger than any sobolev norm on the circle itself .",
    "the analysis of the corresponding toeplitz operators is straightforward and similar to the proof of theorem [ finite - combinations ]",
    ". since @xmath135 has no poles in the annulus , we just have to keep track of the zeroes of @xmath135 . for the index of @xmath133 to change , a zero of @xmath135",

    "can be freely varied , so this is a codimension-@xmath157 event .",
    "if we impose a reality condition : @xmath158 , then zeroes appear only on the real axis or in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "in that case , changing the index by 2 is merely a codimension-1 event . combining these observations we obtain    [ analytic ] in the space of toeplitz operators that are analytic in a ( fixed ) annulus containing @xmath127 , almost every operator is fredholm . for every integer @xmath120 ,",

    "however , since a @xmath161-small perturbation does not change the @xmath26-th derivative by much , the sign of the real part of @xmath135 can change at most @xmath26 times near @xmath165 , so the argument of @xmath135 can only increase or decrease by @xmath170 or less .",

    "all other scenarios have higher codimension and are analogous to having 2 or more zeroes of the @xmath47 zeroes crossing the unit circle at the same point .",
    "the situation is different , however , when the function @xmath135 and the first @xmath160 derivatives all vanish at a point @xmath165 .",
    "then the higher - order derivatives are not protected from @xmath161-small perturbations and , by making such a perturbation , we can change @xmath135 into a function that is identically zero on a small neighborhood of @xmath173 . by making a further small perturbation , we can make @xmath135 wrap around the origin as many times as we like near @xmath173 . more specifically ,",

    "fig.[tanf ] , which we borrowed from @xcite , shows the phase diagram for a split landau level in the harper model with disorder .",
    "more precisely , the diagram describes a harper model with fractional flux @xmath184 through a unit cell .",
    "= 2.5truein    without disorder the conductance @xmath185 of each isolated band satisfies the diophantine equation similar to eq .",
    "[ dio ] , except that for a split landau band @xmath84 and @xmath186 are interchanged . for flux",
    "@xmath184 the diophantine equation fixes the conductances @xmath187 of the bands at the flanks and @xmath188 at the center .",
    "zero disorder is , of course , not generic , and , indeed , there are bands on the @xmath179 axis where the index is not defined , something that the phase rules for toeplitz forbid . under perturbation",
    "the diagram should might so that these bands where the index is not defined disappear .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the diagram in @xcite is obtained by drawing @xmath26 lines emanating from each band where @xmath26 is its hall conductance .    in summary ,",
    "the wild character of the phase diagram of the harper model is tamed by disorder and one finds , remarkably , a phase diagram compatible with the phase rules for toeplitz operators .",
    "motivated by the effect of disorder on the harper model phase portrait , we next consider the effect of perturbations on the phase portraits of landau hamiltonians .",
    "such perturbations will modify the phase diagram near phase boundaries . as a consequence one expects a phase diagram to be qualitatively modified near points of accumulation of phases , even if the perturbation is small .",
    "figures 2 and 3 satisfy the phase rules in the region of large magnetic fields , but fail to do so for small magnetic fields .",
    "we now examine how the two figures might be modified to satisfy the phase rules everywhere .",
    "the phase diagram of the landau hamiltonian in the plane , fig .",
    "[ landau ] will be significantly modified near the line @xmath180 which , by symmetry , must lie in a region with index @xmath189 . a schematic phase diagram that is generic and close to the landau phase diagram",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ landau+toeplitz ] .",
    "= 2.5truein    the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ hyperbolic ] has a region of full measure , the shaded parabola , where the operator is not fredholm .",
    "this is non - generic , and unstable .",
    "a perturbation might produce a phase diagram like [ hyper - toeplitz ] .",
    "note that the two perturbed diagrams , fig .",
    "[ landau+toeplitz ] and [ hyper - toeplitz ] are topologically identical .",
    "= 2.5truein    how do the phase diagrams , figs .",
    "[ landau+toeplitz ] and [ hyper - toeplitz ] , compare with what one finds in experiments on the quantum hall effect ?",
    "for large magnetic fields one finds phase diagrams that resemble both figs .",
    "[ landau ] and [ landau+toeplitz ] and satisfy the phase rules . for weak magnetic fields",
    "one observes a transition to an insulating phase .",
    "the emergence of an insulating phase ( with index 0 ) for small magnetic fields is in agreement with the phase rule and fig .",
    "[ landau+toeplitz ] . however , some experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite have been interpreted as giving evidence to direct transitions from a hall conductance of 2 and 3 to the insulating phase . taken literally",
    ", such transitions would violate the phase rule .",
    "however , these results may merely indicate that , for @xmath1 small , the phase boundaries of fig .",
    "[ landau+toeplitz ] are too closely spaced to be distinguished numerically and experimentally .",
    "the main gap in our analysis is that we have not established a direct relation between the algebra of toeplitz operators , where our phase rules are proven , and the class of operators relevant to ( disordered ) quantum hall systems .    at the minimum ,",
    "toeplitz operators serve as a natural mathematical laboratory . however , there is a more direct justification for considering toeplitz operators .",
    "the most elementary paradigm for a quantum hall system is the landau hamiltonian , in which case one has :    let @xmath28 be a projection on the lowest landau level in @xmath190 , and let @xmath30 be the gauge transformation associated with an aharonov - bohm flux tube at the origin .",
    "then @xmath33 , acting on the range of @xmath28 , differs from a toeplitz operator by a compact operator .",
    "proof : a basis for the lowest landau level is @xmath191 as a consequence @xmath192    in this case , a compact perturbation of @xmath33 is not only a toeplitz operator ; it is a simple shift . however , if the flux tube is placed at a different point , or if the magnetic field is spread out over a finite region , then we obtain a more general toeplitz operator .",
    "if @xmath28 is a projection on a higher landau level , the same results hold but the calculation is more involved . if @xmath28 is a projection onto multiple landau levels , then @xmath33 is a compact perturbation of a direct sum of toeplitz operators , one for each landau level .",
    "this is not to say that toeplitz operators apply directly to all systems , only that they apply to many .",
    "there are basic models where @xmath33 fails to be toeplitz .",
    "indeed , an elementary model for localization is a random multiplication operator , i.e. @xmath193 on @xmath194 .",
    "this is a caricature of strong disorder .",
    "the eigenfunctions are now concentrated at lattice points .",
    "the projection @xmath28 ( below a fermi energy ) is @xmath195 where the sum is over a random set of lattice points with , @xmath196 , in @xmath197 .",
    "@xmath33 is now a multiplication by a phase .",
    "it is an invertible operator and has fredholm index zero .",
    "it is , however , not toeplitz .",
    "it is tempting to directly study the index of @xmath33 , for spectral projections @xmath28 and unitary operators @xmath30 , rather than rely on generic results based on toeplitz operators .",
    "there are , however , several technical obstacles .",
    "the first is that @xmath33 is thought of as acting on @xmath198 , which is a hilbert space in its own right .",
    "this means that a deformation of the parameters of the system leads to a deformation of the space @xmath199 .",
    "in contrast , our strategy so far is formulated on a fixed space .",
    "the second obstacle is that our results depend on continuity properties while spectral projections tend to have bad continuity properties that come from a discontinuity at the fermi energy .    to overcome the first problem one",
    "can replace @xmath33 by an operator @xmath0 defined on the entire hilbert space with coinciding index .",
    "there is large arbitrariness in choosing @xmath0 , but a natural choice is : @xmath200 where @xmath201 .    to overcome the second problem one may want to replace @xmath28 by a fermi function .",
    "that is , replace @xmath28 by a smooth version @xmath202 in that case , however , @xmath203 is no longer equal to @xmath28 , and the different expressions for @xmath0 in equation ( [ f ] ) are no longer equivalent . for each choice",
    ", it would be interesting to derive a phase portrait for index@xmath204 as the temperature , fermi energy , magnetic field and degree of randomness are varied .",
    "in this paper we explored what can be said about generic phase diagrams of indices of fredholm operators .",
    "we did not use the fact that the fredholm operators relevant to the quantum hall effect are of the form @xmath33 , with @xmath28 a spectral projection of an ergodic schrdinger operator .",
    "rather , we considered the index of several natural classes ( and algebras ) of operators .",
    "the weakness of this strategy is that we can not say much that is definitive about quantum hall systems . in its defense",
    ", we recall that replacing the particular by the generic proved to be useful in quantum physics in the hands of wigner , von neuman and dyson @xcite .",
    "whether it will turn out to be useful for quantum hall effect remains to be seen .",
