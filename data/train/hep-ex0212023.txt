    "leptoquarks are hypothetical bosons which couple to a lepton and a quark via a yukawa coupling ( denoted @xmath0 ) . in the standard model , both quarks and leptons occur in left - handed @xmath1 doublets and right - handed @xmath1 singlets .",
    "the symmetry between quarks and leptons leads to the cancellation of triangle anomalies which make the sm renormalizable .",
    "leptoquarks appear in theories@xcite in which this symmetry is more fundamental",
    ".    leptoquarks ( lqs ) are color triplets , which would be pair produced in either @xmath2 or @xmath3 interactions at @xmath4 or @xmath5 colliders . because they carry electroweak charge , they would also be pair produced in @xmath6 or @xmath7 collisions .",
    "only standard model gauge couplings are involved in pair production ; therefore the cross sections depend neither on the quark - lepton - lq yukawa coupling nor on the quark and lepton generations to which the leptoquark couples .",
    "in contrast , leptoquarks would be singly produced via the yukawa coupling in a lepton - quark collision .",
    "searches at electron - proton colliders are sensitive only to lqs which couple to electrons and the sensitivity to lqs which couple to second and third generation quarks is far below that of first - generation lqs .",
    "leptoquarks are usually ( but not always ) assumed to be _",
    "generation diagonal_. models in which lqs couple to more than one generation of quarks or leptons would induce flavor - changing neutral currents@xcite or lepton flavor violation@xcite respectively .",
    "the model of buchmller , rckl and wyler@xcite ( brw ) , in which leptoquarks couple to a single generation of sm fermions via chiral yukawa couplings which are invariant under @xmath8 is often used to classify possible leptoquark species . in the brw model baryon and lepton numbers ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 )",
    "are conserved ; there exist ten possible leptoquark species characterized by the chirality of the coupling , the the spin ( @xmath11 or 1 ) , the weak isospin ( @xmath120 , @xmath13 , or 1 ) , and the fermion number , @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "four of the species could have separate couplings to right- and left - handed leptons .",
    "a leptoquark which coupled first generation quarks to both left- and right - handed electrons would mediate @xmath16 decay@xcite .",
    "the agreement of the measured decay rate with sm predictions motivates the conventional assumption that only one of the couplings can be nonzero . in the most commonly used notation@xcite @xmath17 scalar ( @xmath18 ) and vector ( @xmath19 ) species",
    "are denoted @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the @xmath27 species are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the sub- and superscripts indicate the lepton chirality and the weak isospin respectively .",
    "the species @xmath35 and @xmath36 differ by two units of hypercharge from @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "partial widths for scalar and vector lqs with mass @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the tevatron experiments have performed searches for first , second , and third generation leptoquarks , including separate analyses for decays to charged leptons and to neutrinos .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : tevatron ] .",
    "limits are more restrictive for lqs which decay to @xmath40 and @xmath41 than those decaying to @xmath42 .",
    "cdf has used their silicon vertex detector to tag @xmath43 and @xmath44 quarks@xcite while d0 identifies @xmath43-jets by associated muons@xcite . for scalar lqs , nlo cross section calculations@xcite",
    "are used in limit setting . in vector lq cross section calculations@xcite ( done at lo ) , the coupling of the lq and gluon fields is model dependent and limits for several different models@xcite are quoted .",
    ".limits on leptoquarks from the tevatron .",
    "the first two columns give the generation and @xmath45 , the branching ratio to a charged lepton and a quark .",
    "the next two columns give the lower bounds on @xmath37 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "vector lqs limits are given for both low and high cross section models .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , < \" , ]     table [ tab : lephera ] shows combined lep limits@xcite on lqs which couple to @xmath46 and quarks of different generations .",
    "these limits were obtained using the cross section for @xmath47 hadrons for @xmath48 between 130 and 207 gev . for lqs which couple to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the the @xmath51 and @xmath52 fractions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the forward - backward asymmetries were also used .",
    "for first generation leptoquarks , the tevatron experiments have set limits on scalars ( coupling to @xmath40 ) of @xmath55 gev and corresponding vector lq limits in the range from 233 to 345 gev , depending on model assumptions .",
    "the lep experiments have set lower limits on @xmath37 ( which are approximately proportional to @xmath0 ) which range from 165 to 917 gev for @xmath56 .",
    "the hera experiments have set lower mass limits in the range of @xmath57 to 280 gev for @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , searches at the tevatron and lep have constrained lqs coupling to leptons and quarks of the second and third generations .    9 j.c .",
