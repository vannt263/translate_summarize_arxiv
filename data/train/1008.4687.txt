    "in many low dimensional systems , heat transport unexpectedly violates fourier s law of heat conduction  @xcite .",
    "this can be because of integrability or proximity to integrability , which is more common in low dimensions , as recognized starting from the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , even ergodic low - dimensional systems can show anomalous heat conduction , with the conductivity diverging with system size , if they conserve momentum .",
    "apart from the theoretical interest , understanding heat transport in such systems is of relevance to heat conduction in carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "most of the recent activity  @xcite in this field has dealt with the zero - frequency conductivity .",
    "but time dependent temperature sources have been discussed in experimental situations in the context of measuring the frequency dependent thermal conductivity  @xcite and specific heat  @xcite of glassy systems .",
    "theoretically , there have been a few studies on the frequency dependent thermal current response using a microscopic approach based on luttinger s derivation of the green - kubo formula and a hypothesis about the equality of certain transport coefficients  @xcite , and from a phenomenological approach @xcite . a recent paper studied thermal ratchet effects in an inhomogeneous anharmonic chain coupled to baths with time - dependent temperatures @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt a different approach : we find the linear heat conductance of a system placed in contact with two heat reservoirs with time - dependent temperatures . physically",
    "the notion of bath temperatures oscillating in time make sense if we assume that the frequency of oscillation is much smaller compared to time scales for local thermal equilibration in the reservoirs .",
    "an exact expression ( in the linear response regime ) for the heat current due to a small oscillating temperature difference between the reservoirs is obtained .",
    "our earlier result  @xcite obtained the zero frequency conductance of a finite system rather than the conductivity in the infinite system limit .",
    "thus the thermodynamic limit was not taken first ( in fact , not at all ) , in contrast to the standard green - kubo formula  @xcite , which can not be applied when the infinite system conductivity diverges .",
    "our expression for the zero frequency conductance involved the heat current auto - correlation function for an open system .",
    "the extension to finite frequencies in this paper follows the same approach , with the response now depending on the position inside the system where the current is measured .",
    "we also show results of numerical simulations for the frequency dependent response function by measuring the appropriate correlation function . for one - dimensional momentum conserving anharmonic crystals , we find a resonant response at a frequency @xmath0 for a chain of @xmath1 particles due to sound waves propagating from one end of the system to the other . as @xmath1 increases ,",
    "the resonance gets broader and its height decreases slightly .",
    "however , its height relative to the zero - frequency response _ increases _ , and for large @xmath1 this resonance is stronger than the zero frequency response .",
    "we find that the low frequency peak disappears for systems where momentum is not conserved .",
    "fourier s law is known to be valid for such systems , so that the heat current should satisfy the diffusion equation .",
    "if one compares the numerical results for the frequency - dependent heat current with the prediction from the diffusion equation at the single bond level , there seem to be substantial discrepancies .",
    "numerical simulations for the frequency dependent response function of a one - dimensional harmonic crystal , and an exact analytical expression for the full response ( for finite @xmath2 ) of the same , are also presented . as far as we are aware of this",
    "is the first example of a case where an analytical expression for the response function has been obtained . for a harmonic system",
    "the full response is also linear and hence we expect the linear response result to agree with the exact response function .",
    "indeed we find excellent agreement between the numerical simulations of the expression of the linear response and the numerically evaluated exact response expression .",
    "all three systems mentioned above also show a high - frequency peak in the response function , whose location is independent of @xmath3 one can loosely ascribe this to the fact that the dynamics in the interior of the system are underdamped ( actually , undamped ) , so that particles approaching each other recoil , and the heat current auto - correlation function shows rapid oscillations in the temporal domain .",
    "such high - frequency oscillations are not seen in hard particle models , such as the random collision model  @xcite .",
    "this is discussed further when we derive the analytical expression for the harmonic oscillator . however , a quantitative understanding of the high - frequency peak is lacking .",
    "we follow the derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the finite frequency heat conductance of an oscillator chain with langevin baths at the ends ; more detail is provided in ref .",
    "consider the motion of @xmath1 particles on a one dimensional lattice , described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 are the displacements of the particles about their equilibrium positions and their velocities , and @xmath8 are their masses .",
    "we assume fixed boundary conditions , @xmath9 the particles 1 and @xmath1 are connected to white noise langevin heat baths at temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 thus the equations of motion are @xmath12\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\delta_{l,1}[\\eta_l(t ) -\\gamma_l v_1 ] + \\delta_{l , n}[\\eta_r(t ) -\\gamma_r v_n ] \\label{dyneq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath13 here @xmath14 are uncorrelated zero mean gaussian noise terms satisfying the fluctuation dissipation relations @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes an average over the noise .",
    "the derivation of the linear response theory starts with the fokker - planck equation for the full phase space distribution function @xmath17 . if @xmath18 the steady state solution to the equation is the equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",
    "we now assume that the temperatures at the two ends are oscillating in time with @xmath19 .",
    "we will obtain a perturbative solution about the equilibrium solution .",
    "the steps are very similar to the standard derivation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem . the fokker planck equation corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ dyneq ] ) is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the force acting on the @xmath22th particle .",

    "we get for the average heat current flowing between any bond on the chain by : @xmath49 for a oscillating temperature given by @xmath50 this gives : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the magnitude of the response  to be computed numerically in section  [ sec : numerical ]  and @xmath53 is the phase .",
    "the correlation function @xmath54 on the right hand side of this equation is for a system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath55    a few comments are appropriate here .",
    "first , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath56 it is possible to manipulate the integrand on the right and make it proportional to the aut - correlation function of the heat current integrated over the entire chain , @xmath57 yielding a result resembling the standard green - kubo formula ( but without the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "this manipulation is not possible for @xmath58 thus the current response depends on @xmath59 the position inside the chain where the response is measured , as one would expect .",
    "moreover , the correlation function involves @xmath60 which is different from the heat current .",
    "second , although we have assumed that @xmath61 to resemble the zero - frequency calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite where such an assumption is appropriate , at @xmath62 there is no reason why one can not treat @xmath63 and @xmath64 as independent variables .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the derivation above and obtain the response to @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) replaced by the first and second part of eq .",
    "( [ jfpdef1 ] ) respectively . for large @xmath67",
    "one expects that the response to a oscillatory temperature perturbation at one end of the chain should only depend on the distance from that end and be the same as for a semi - infinite chain .    finally , expressions similar to eq .",
    "( [ j12ff ] ) can be obtained for any quantity that depends on the phase space variables of the system , not just @xmath68 it does _ not _ apply to the heat current flowing into the system from the reservoirs , since they involve the langevin noise @xmath69 and these have to be obtained indirectly .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ j12ff ] ) is valid for @xmath70 and one also has @xmath71 replacing the @xmath72 with a @xmath73 acting on @xmath2 and integrating by parts , adding this to eq .",
    "( [ j12ff ] ) , and using the fact that @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the heat current flowing in from the left reservoir ) , we have @xmath76 fourier transforming , for @xmath77 the heat current flowing from the left reservoir is @xmath78 this response function has a non - zero @xmath79 limit from the second term on the right hand side .",
    "this is reasonable : if @xmath2 oscillates at a very high frequency , the effect on @xmath80 should be negligible , but the current flowing from the left reservoir should oscillate because @xmath81 is proportional to the instantaneous temperature of the reservoir . the instantaneous response of eq .",
    "( [ j1lffft ] ) is a peculiarity of white noise stochastic baths , and is not seen for nose - hoover baths  where even the heat current at the boundary is in terms of the extended phase space variables  or a fluid system with maxwell boundary conditions where continuity requires that the heat current at the boundary and just inside the system should be the same .",
    "therefore , hereafter we work with @xmath82 and @xmath83 when we want the current at the boundaries .",
    "although the derivation given above is for a one - dimensional chain , it is straightforward to see that it is valid for any system that is connected to only two reservoirs , regardless of its dimensionality .",

    "higher harmonics of the low frequency peak can be barely discerned . as the system size",
    "is increased , the low frequency peak broadens and decreases slightly in height , but the zero frequency response drops much faster .",
