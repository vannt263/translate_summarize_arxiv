    "the @xmath199 mass is required to be near the @xmath200 .",

    "the clas(p ) reaction @xmath203 @xcite is an exclusive reaction uncomplicated by nuclear target effects ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "after cuts are made to isolate this reaction the published @xmath19 mass spectrum shows no structure .",
    "but then kinematic cuts are made to remove processes that are potential backgrounds to @xmath14 production such as :    1 .",
    "@xmath204 followed by @xmath205 2 .",
    "@xmath206 followed by @xmath207 and @xmath208 3 .",
    "@xmath209 followed by @xmath207    to remove these `` backgrounds '' the following cuts are made : @xmath210  ( gev/@xmath41)@xmath211 and @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the angle of the @xmath43 in the overall center - of - mass . the result is a @xmath19 mass distribution sharply reduced in statistics but with a peak at the @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore it is claimed that the @xmath214 effective mass shows a peak at 2.4  gev/@xmath5 leading to the conclusion that an important mode for @xmath14 production is @xmath215 followed by @xmath216 .",
    "the authors do not discuss the stability of observed peaks with respect to the kinematic cuts .",
    "we did monte carlo studies of reactions such as @xmath217 and found that the kinematic cuts can produce peaks observed in the clas(p ) data depending on details of the spin - state of the @xmath182 .",
    "stoler also pointed out @xcite that the these data do show an anti - correlation of @xmath14 signal with the @xmath218 signal which is surprising since one might expect associated production of the @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath219 to be favored .",
    "however , this anti - coorelation would be expected from a kinematical reflection .",
    "the leps(1 ) and leps(2 ) reactions take place off a carbon nucleus leading to complications due to fermi motion of the target nucleon . because only the @xmath43 and @xmath39 are measured",
    ", they then must assume that the unobserved neutron carries off the remaining missing momentum .",
    "in the case of clas(d ) , the @xmath14 is observed in the effective mass of @xmath19 where the @xmath189 is missing .",
    "however , to be able to reconstruct the reaction , the proton is required to have sufficient energy to escape the target .",
    "the proton is required to somehow be involved in the reaction , which leads to complications in understanding both the reaction itself and the backgrounds to the reaction .",
    "the cosy experiment @xcite depends on identification of the reaction @xmath220 but this experiment is highly unconstrained .",
    "this only information about this experiment is a collection of space - points from three pairs of hodoscope planes downstream of a `` point '' target .",
    "there is no momentum measurement , time measurement nor particle identification .",
    "the @xmath200 is identified through its decay into @xmath221 between the first and second hodoscope planes and the @xmath222 is identified as a kink. this experiment is seriously under - constrained and subject to backgrounds .    reported masses , with error bars , of the @xmath14 . ]",
    "figure  [ masses2 ] shows a plot of the masses reported for the @xmath14 .",
    "the quoted masses are inconsistent with each other although the reported widths are less than experimental resolution and these experiments accurately reproduce masses of established resonances .",
    "cahn and trilling @xcite analyzed the data from the diana experiment and conclude that the width of the @xmath14 has a width of less than 1  mev/@xmath5 .",
    "et al _ @xcite reanalyzed @xmath223 and conclude that the addition of the @xmath14 with a width of about 5  mev/@xmath5 is improbable but the data are consistent with a width of the @xmath14 less than 1  mev/@xmath5 .",
    "the experimental evidence for the pentaquark states @xmath14 , @xmath34 and @xmath37 has been reviewed .",
    "the @xmath14 has been observed in 13 reactions where two of the reports are from the leps group @xcite and another two from the clas group @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 has been searched for by 16 separate experiments and all those came up with null results .",
    "the positive sightings are complicated by nuclear target effects , mechanisms that can generate spurious peaks and problems with kinematic identification of final states .",
    "furthermore , stringent cuts , the stability of which are not well understood , are required to isolate the peaks . on the other hand , experiments that have searched for the @xmath14 with null results have high statistics and superior resolution .",
    "the reported masses for the @xmath14 are inconsistent with each other and the width is unusually small for a typical hadronic state .",
    "there have been attempts , _",
    "e.g. _ karliner and lipkin @xcite , to understand all these results in terms of models that would suppress pentaquark production in some processes and not others .",
    "if it is real , the @xmath14 is exotic not only in its flavor quantum numbers but also in its production and its decay .",
    "the @xmath34 has only been observed by na49 @xcite and searched for , but not observed , by 9 experiments @xcite .",
    "it is hard to reconcile the existence of the @xmath34 with this overwhelming negative evidence .",
    "the @xmath37 has only been observed by h1 @xcite and searched for , but not observed , by 6 experiments @xcite .",
    "it is hard to reconcile the existence of the @xmath37 with this overwhelming negative evidence .",
    "based on all this , the conclusion is that the experimental evidence for pentaquarks is very weak .",
