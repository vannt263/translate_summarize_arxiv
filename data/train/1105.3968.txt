    "there are several notions of duality in homotopy theory , and a family of such originates with brown and comenetz . in",

    "brown - comenetz duality is difficult to tackle directly , so mahowald and rezk studied a tower approximating it , such that at each stage the self - dual objects turn out to have interesting chromatic properties .",
    "in particular , they show that self - duality is detected on cohomology as a module over the steenrod algebra .",
    "consequently , a version of the spectrum @xmath8 of topological modular forms possesses self - dual properties .",
    "the question thus arises whether this self - duality of @xmath8 is already inherent in its geometric construction .",
    "indeed , the advent of derived algebraic geometry not only allows for the construction of an object such as @xmath8 , but also for bringing in geometric notions of duality to homotopy theory , most notably grothendieck - serre duality .",
    "however , it is rarely possible to identify the abstractly constructed ( derived ) dualizing sheaves with a concrete and computable object .",
    "this stands in contrast to ordinary algebraic geometry , where a few smallness assumptions guarantee that the sheaf of differentials is a dualizing sheaf ( eg . ) .    nevertheless , the case of the moduli stack of elliptic curves or @xmath9 ; we chose the notation from . ]",
    "@xmath10 and topological modular forms allows for a hands - on approach to serre duality in a derived setting . even if the underlying ordinary stack does not admit a traditional serre duality pairing , the derived version of @xmath10 is considerably better behaved .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how the input from homotopy theory brings duality back into the picture .",
    "conversely , it provides an integral interpretation of the aforementioned self - duality for @xmath8 that is inherent in the geometry of the moduli stack of elliptic curves .",
    "the duality that naturally occurs from the geometric viewpoint is not quite that of brown and comenetz , but an integral version thereof , called anderson duality and denoted @xmath11 .",
    "after localization with respect to morava @xmath12-theory @xmath13 for @xmath14 , however , anderson duality and brown - comenetz duality only differ by a shift .",
    "elliptic curves have come into homotopy theory because they give rise to interesting one - parameter formal groups of heights one or two .",
    "the homotopical version of these is the notion of an elliptic spectrum : an even periodic spectrum @xmath15 , together with an elliptic curve @xmath16 over @xmath17 , and an isomorphism between the formal group of @xmath15 and the completion of @xmath16 at the identity section .",
    "tale maps @xmath18 give rise to such spectra ; more strongly , as a consequence of the goerss - hopkins - miller theorem , the assignment of an elliptic spectrum to an tale map to @xmath10 gives an tale sheaf of @xmath19-ring spectra on the moduli stack of elliptic curves .",
    "better still , the compactification of @xmath10 , which we will hereby denote by @xmath0 , admits such a sheaf , denoted @xmath20 , whose underlying ordinary stack is the usual stack of generalized elliptic curves .",

    "we begin by recalling the definitions and properties of brown - comenetz and anderson duality .    in , brown and comenetz studied the functor on spectra @xmath24",
