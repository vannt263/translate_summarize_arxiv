    "the searches for micro - lensing events towards the magellanic clouds have as their hopeful goal the determination of what the dark matter is made of ( paczyski 1996 , and references therein ) . while just over a handful of robust micro - lensing events have been detected towards the lmc by the macho collaboration ( alcock et al .",
    "1997a ) , the interpretation of the result has not been agreed upon .",
    "the review of the vigorous discussion of the subject is beyond the scope of this short paper .",
    "a very intriguing event has been recently discovered towards the small magellanic cloud by the macho collaboration ( alcock et al .",
    "1997b ) , and confirmed by the eros collaboration ( palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "it had a very long time scale , @xmath0 days ( 247 days on the macho scale ) .",
    "it has been found to be a periodic variable with the amplitude @xmath4 and the period of 5.1 days ( palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , it was not clear what varied , the lensed star or its unresolved blend .",
    "this has been clarified by the ogle collaboration ( udalski et al .",
    "1997 ) , which resolved the two stars thanks to a smaller pixel size and a better seeing : the variable is the lensed star .",
    "the variability continues with the same amplitude as it was during the micro - lensing event .",
    "the persistence of periodic variability implies that the lensed star is likely to be an ellipsoidal variable ( udalski et al .",
    "such stars are common .",
    "their variability is a result of a tidal distortion in a binary with the orbital period twice the photometric period , in this case 10.2 days .",
    "an alternative explanation for the periodic variability might be a slowly pulsating b stars ( spb ) as discovered by the hipparcos mission ( waelkens et al . 1997 )",
    ". however , such oscillations , just as the @xmath5 cephei pulsations ( dziembowski & pamiatnych 1993 ) , are likely to be driven by iron opacity , and therefore they are not likely to be present in the smc . in any case , the nature of the periodic oscillations , ellipsoidal variability or spb , should be settled with spectroscopic observations .",
    "this paper is based on the assumption that the lensed star is a binary ellipsoidal variable .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe parallactic effect due to binary motion of the source .",
    "this is analogous to the parallactic effect of earth s orbital motion ( gould 1992 , alcock et al .",
    "consider a source which is a binary , with the orbital period @xmath6 , and a circular orbit with the angular diameter @xmath7 .",
    "the orbit has an inclination @xmath8 to the celestial plane , with @xmath9 corresponding to the observer located in the orbital plane .",
    "the orbit appears as an ellipse with the minor axis @xmath10 .",
    "the angle between the major axis and the direction of the source s proper motion with respect to the lens is @xmath11 .",
    "an example of such lensing geometry is shown in fig.1 , where the two binary components have equal mass , and the two orbital angles are : @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    for the purpose of this analysis i shall adopt a hypothesis that the lens is in the smc , and that the relative proper motion of the source with respect to the lens is @xmath14 .",
    "the angular einstein ring radius is @xmath15 let the two stellar masses be @xmath16 , and the orbital period @xmath3 days .",
    "the diameter of the circular orbit is @xmath17 ^{1/3 } \\left ( { p_{orb } \\over 2 \\pi } \\right ) ^{2/3 } = 2.2 \\times 10^{12 } ~ { \\rm cm } ~ \\left ( { m_1 + m_2 \\over 4 ~ m_{\\odot } }   \\right ) ^{1/3 } .\\ ] ] the corresponding angular orbital diameter at the distance of 60 kpc is @xmath18    a model light curve was calculated for the recent smc event assuming that the blend contributed 26% to the total light at minimum ( udalski et al .",
    "1997 ) , the impact parameter was @xmath19 , the lensed source had its brightness modulated with the period @xmath20 days , and the amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "first , no lensing effects due to binary motion of the source were taken into account .",
    "the difference between the modulated light curve and a micro - lensing light curve with identical parameters but without any modulation is shown at the top of fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "if the periodic light modulation is due to tidal distortion of the binary components , then the periodic displacement of the two stars with respect to the binary center of mass modifies the lensing magnification .",
    "let the fractional contribution of the two components and the blend to the minimum light be : @xmath21 , respectively , with @xmath22 , and the blend contribution @xmath23 ( udalski et al . 1997 ) .",
    "let the two components have the mass fractions @xmath24 , respectively , with @xmath25 , and the total mass @xmath26 . the binary center of mass moves along a straight line along the ` x ' direction .",
    "the time dependence of the two angular coordinates is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the time of maximum magnification .",
    "the primary component moves around the binary center of mass according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the secondary s orbit is given as @xmath31 finally , the trajectories of both components are given as @xmath32    the magnification with respect to the combined non - lensed brightness of the binary and the blend can be calculated as @xmath33 + f_3 , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 note , that the ellipsoidal light variations with the amplitude @xmath35 reach the local light maximum at the time of maximum angular separation between the two components , when the two stars are seen ` sideways ' and the tidal distortion makes them appear somewhat larger , and brighter , than a quarter of the orbital period later ( or earlier ) .",
    "a few examples of binary modulation of a micro - lensing light curve are are shown in fig.2 and fig.3 . in both figures",
    "the uppermost curve corresponds to the photometric modulation due to binary components tidal distortion .",
    "the following three light curves present the effects of binary source modulation of the lensing . in fig.2",
    "these are the differences between the four models and the standard micro - lensing light curve . in fig.3",
    "the three lower light curves are the differences between the corresponding curves in fig.2 , and the topmost curve .",
    "the first of these three corresponds to a binary with both components having identical masses and luminosities , and the orbit diameter set to be 0.067 of the einstein ring radius , following equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the last two curve corresponds to a binary with only one bright component separated from the center of mass by 0.013 einstein ring radii .",
    "all curves are labeled with the values of orbital angles @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "the main practical problem with the binary parallactic effect is the very large number of parameters which make model fitting impractical unless the binary nature of the source is constrained with spectroscopic observations . in the case of the recent smc event",
    "the spectroscopy is needed to verify the hypothesis that the source is a binary .",
    "fig.2 and fig.3 demonstrate that the effect of binary modulation is likely to be small in the recent smc event .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the binary effect can be estimated expanding the binary modulation in a power series by writing equation ( 9 ) as @xmath36 + f_3 , \\ ] ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 ^{1/2 } , \\hskip 1.0 cm \\tan \\beta = { \\varphi _ { y , cm }",
    "\\over \\varphi _ { x , cm } } .\\ ] ] the angle @xmath5 is between the line joining the lens and the binary center of mass and the trajectory of that center . the small range of distances from the lens covered by the orbital ellipse",
    "is calculated as @xmath39 .",
    "the lens magnification is expanded in a power series , with the first two small terms corresponding to the dipole and quadrupole moments of the binary light distribution : @xmath40 the corresponding amplitudes of dipole and quadrupole variations are calculated as @xmath41 the amplitudes calculated with these formulae are shown with dashed lines in fig.3 .",
    "if the lensed binary has a photometric dipole moment then the lensing variations are much larger than in the case when there is no dipole , as quadrupole variations are very small ( cf .",
    "it follows that binary lens modulation is much stronger if the two components are not identical .",
    "if future spectroscopic observations of the smc star confirm its binary nature , then it will be very important to determine not only the amplitude of the orbital radial velocity variations , but also to estimate the luminosity ratio of the two components .",
    "only macho collaboration has the full event well covered photometrically",
    ". it will be very interesting to find out if that data will provide useful information about the presence or absence of the binary parallactic effect .",
    "the presence or absence of the effect will provide additional constraint on the location of the lens ."
