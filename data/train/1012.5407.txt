    "the article in _ science _ describes an experiment involving the magnetic material cobalt niobate ( conb@xmath1o@xmath2 ) .",
    "the experiment involved a 2-centimeter - long piece of this crystal , weighing about 8 grams . ]",
    "the material was chosen because the internal crystal structure is such that magnetic co@xmath3 ions are arranged into long chains running along one of the crystal s axes , and this could give rise to 1-dimensional magnetic behavior . , and",
    "( 2 ) the strength of the magnetic interactions between the co@xmath3 spins is low enough that the quantum critical point corresponding to @xmath4 in ( [ quant.h ] ) can be matched by magnetic fields currently achievable in the laboratory . ] in particular , physicists expected that this material would provide a realization of the famous ising model , which we now describe briefly .",
    "the term _ ising model _ refers generically to the original , classical model .",
    "this simple model for magnetic interactions was suggested by w.  lenz as a thesis problem for his student e.  ising , whose thesis appeared in hamburg in 1922 @xcite .",
    "the classical form of the model is built on a square , periodic , @xmath5-dimensional lattice , with the periods sufficiently large that the periodic boundary conditions do nt play a significant role in the physics .",
    "each site @xmath6 is assigned a spin @xmath7 , interpreted as the projection of the spin onto some preferential axis .",
    "the energy of a given configuration of spins is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant and the sum ranges over pairs @xmath10 of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "this hamiltonian gives rise to a statistical ensemble of states that is used to model the thermodynamic properties of actual magnetic materials .",
    "this essentially amounts to a probability distribution on the set of spin configurations , with each configuration weighted by @xmath11 ( the boltzmann distribution ) , where @xmath12 is constant and @xmath13 is the temperature .",
    "the assumption of this distribution makes the various physical quantities , such as individual spins , average energy , magnetization , etc .",
    ", into random variables",
    ". for @xmath14 , spins at neighboring sites tend to align in the same direction ; this behavior is called _ ferromagnetic _ , because this is what happens with iron .    to describe the cobalt niobate experiment we actually want the quantum spin chain version of the ising model . in this quantum model ,",
    "each site in a 1-dimensional ( finite periodic ) chain is assigned a 2-dimensional complex hilbert space . the pauli spin matrices @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 act on each of these vector spaces as spin observables , meaning they are self - adjoint operators whose eigenstates correspond to states of particular spin .",
    "for example , the @xmath18 eigenvectors of @xmath17 correspond to up and down spins along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "a general spin state is a unit vector in the 2-dimensional hilbert space , which could be viewed as a superposition of up and down spin states , if we use those eigenvectors as a basis .",
    "the hamiltonian operator for the standard 1-dimensional quantum ising model is given by @xmath20.\\ ] ] in the quantum statistical ensemble one assigns probabilities to the eigenvectors of @xmath21 weighted by the corresponding energy eigenvalues .",
    "this then defines , via the boltzmann distribution again , a probability distribution on the unit ball in the total hilbert space of the system .",
    "just as in the classical case , physical quantities become random variables with distributions that depend on the temperature and constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is by means of these distributions that the model makes predictions about the interrelationships of these quantities .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ quant.h ] ) has a ferromagnetic effect ( assuming @xmath24 ) , just as in the classical case .",
    "that is , it causes spins of adjacent sites to align with each other along the @xmath19-axis , which we will refer to as the _ preferential _ axis .",
    "( experimental physicists might call this the  easy \" axis . )",
    "the second term represents the influence of an external magnetic field in the @xmath25-direction , perpendicular to the @xmath19-direction ",
    "well refer to this as the _ transverse _ axis .",
    "the effect of the second term is _ paramagnetic _ , meaning that it encourages the spins to align with the transverse field .",
    "the 1-dimensional quantum ising spin chain exhibits a phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "the phase transition ( also called a critical point ) is the point of transition between the ferromagnetic regime ( @xmath26 , where spins tend to align along the @xmath19-axis ) and the paramagnetic ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the critical point @xmath28 is distinguished by singular behavior of various macroscopic physical quantities , such as the _ correlation length_. roughly speaking , this is the average size of the regions in which the spins are aligned with each other .    to define correlation length a little more",
    "precisely , we consider the statistical correlation between the @xmath19-components of spins at two sites separated by a distance @xmath29 .",
    "these spins are just random variables whose joint distribution depends on the constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 as well as the separation @xmath29 and the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "( we are assuming @xmath29 is large compared to the lattice spacing , but small compared to the overall dimensions of the system . ) for @xmath27 the correlation falls off exponentially as @xmath30 , because spins lined up along the @xmath25-axis will be uncorrelated in the @xmath19-direction ; the constant @xmath31 is the correlation length .",
    "in contrast , at the critical point @xmath4 and @xmath32 , the decay of the spin correlation is given by a power law ; this radical change of behavior corresponds to the divergence of @xmath31 .",
    "this phase transition has been observed experimentally in a lihof@xmath33 magnet @xcite .",
    "one might wonder why an external magnetic field is included by default in the quantum case but not in the classical case .",
    "the reason for this is a correspondence between the classical models and the quantum models of one lower dimension .",
    "the quantum model includes a notion of time - evolution of an observable according to the schrdinger equation , and the correspondence involves interpreting one of the classical dimensions as imaginary time in the quantum model . under this correspondence ,",
    "the classical interaction in the spatial directions gives the quantum ferromagnetic term , while interactions in the imaginary time direction give the external field term , see @xcite for details .",
    "although there are some important differences in the physical interpretation on each side , the classical - quantum correspondence allows various calculations to be carried over from one case to the other .",
    "for example , the critical behavior of the 1-dimensional transverse - field quantum ising model ( [ quant.h ] ) at zero temperature , with the transverse field parameter tuned to the critical value @xmath4 , can be `` mapped '' onto equivalent physics for the classical 2-dimensional ising model ( [ class.h ] ) , at a non - zero temperature .",
    "the latter case is the famous phase transition of the 2-dimensional classical model , which was discovered by peierls and later solved exactly by onsager @xcite .",
    "the actual magnet used in the experiment is not quite modeled by the quantum ising hamiltonian . in the ferromagnetic regime ( @xmath34 )",
    ", weak couplings between the magnetic chains create an effective magnetic field pointing along the preferential axis @xcite .",
    "the relevant model for the experiment is thus @xmath35,\\ ] ] which is just with an additional term @xmath36 representing this internal magnetic field .    the first phase of the cobalt niobate experiment tested the appropriateness of as a model for the magnetic dynamics in the absence of an external magnetic field , i.e. , with @xmath37 .",
    "the experimental evidence does support the claim that this 3-dimensional object is behaving as a 1-dimensional magnetic system .",
    "for example , figure [ zerofield ] shows a comparison of the experimental excitation energies ( as a function of wave vector ) to theoretical predictions from the 1-dimensional model .",
    "the presence of a sequence of well - defined and closely spaced energy levels , as shown in these pictures , is predicted only in dimension one .",
    "before we explain how the rather simple quantum ising model from the previous sections leads to a theory involving @xmath0 , we had better nail down what it means to speak of  @xmath0 \" .",
    "it s an ambiguous term , with at least the following six common meanings :    1 .",
    "the _ root system _ of type @xmath0 .",
    "this is a collection of 240 points , called _ roots _ , in @xmath38 .",
    "the usual publicity photo for @xmath0 ( reproduced in figure [ gosset.pop ] ) is the orthogonal projection of the root system onto a copy of @xmath39 in @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath0 _ lattice _ , which is the subgroup of @xmath38 ( additively ) generated by the root system .",
    "[ list.c ] a _ complex lie group_in particular , a closed subgroup of @xmath40that is simple and 248-dimensional .",
    "there are also three simple _ real _ lie groups  meaning in particular that they are closed subgroups of @xmath41whose complexification is the complex lie group from .",
    "( the fact that there are exactly three is part of elie cartan s classification of simple real lie groups ; see @xcite for an outline of a modern proof . )",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "the _ split _ real @xmath0 .",
    "this is the form of @xmath0 that one can define easily over any field or even over an arbitrary scheme .",
    "its killing form has signature 8 .",
    "the _ compact _ real @xmath0 , which is the unique largest subgroup of the complex @xmath0 that is compact as a topological space .",
    "its killing form has signature @xmath42 .",
    "3 .   the remaining real form of @xmath0 is sometimes called  quaternionic \" . its killing form has signature @xmath43 .    in physics ,",
    "the split real @xmath0 appears in supergravity @xcite and the compact real @xmath0 appears in heterotic string theory @xcite .",
    "these two appearances in physics , however , are purely theoretical ; the models in which they are appear are not yet subject to experiment .",
    "it is the compact real @xmath0 ( or , more precisely , the associated lie algebra ) that appears in the context of the cobalt niobate experiment , making this the first actual experiment to detect a phenomenon that could be modeled using @xmath0 .",
    "there have also been two recent frenzies in the popular press concerning @xmath0 .",
    "one concerned the computation of the kazhdan - lusztig - vogan polynomials which you can read about in the prizewinning paper @xcite ; that work involved the split real @xmath0 .",
    "the other frenzy was sparked by the manuscript @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 referred to in @xcite is clearly meant to be one of the real forms , but the manuscript contains too many contradictory statements to be sure which one might be specified . at the top of page 18 is a form containing a product of the non - split , non - compact form of @xmath44 and the compact @xmath45 ; therefore it is the split real @xmath0 by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath0 described in the middle of page 21 is supposed to contain a copy of @xmath46 , but there is no such real form of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , on page 29 , the quaternionic @xmath0 is mentioned in the text . ] , and in any case the whole idea has serious difficulties as explained in @xcite .      throughout this note",
    "we conflate a real lie group @xmath47 , which is a manifold , with its lie algebra @xmath48 , which is the tangent space to @xmath47 at the identity and is a real vector space endowed with a nonassociative multiplication .",
    "this identification is essentially harmless and is standard in physics . even when physicists discuss symmetry `` groups ''",
    ", they are frequently interested in symmetries that hold only in a local sense , and so the lie algebra is actually the more relevant object .",
    "moreover , physicists typically compute within the complexification @xmath49 of @xmath48 .",
    "this is the complex vector space with elements of the form @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where complex conjugation acts via @xmath53 .",
    "note that one can recover @xmath48 as the subspace of elements fixed by complex conjugation .",
    "therefore , morally speaking , working with the @xmath54-algebra @xmath48 ( as mathematicians often do ) amounts to the same as working with @xmath49 together with complex conjugation ( as physicists do ) .",
    "this is an example of the general theory of galois descent as outlined in , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "what possible relevance could a 248-dimensional algebra have for a discrete one - dimensional statistical physics model ? this is a long and interesting story , and we can only give a few highlights here .    as we mentioned above , the 1-dimensional quantum ising model from",
    "undergoes a phase transition at zero temperature at the critical value of the transverse magnetic field strength .",
    "if the system is close to this critical point , the correlation length ( described in  [ ising.sec ] ) will be very large compared to the lattice spacing , and so we can assume that the discrete spins vary smoothly across nearby lattice sites . in this regime we can thus effectively model the system using continuous `` field '' variables , i.e. , using quantum field theory . for the 1-dimensional quantum ising model ,",
    "the corresponding continuous theory is a quantum field theory of free , spinless fermionic particles in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions .    to understand what happens as the critical point",
    "is approached , one can apply `` scaling '' transformations that dilate the macroscopic length scales ( e.g.  the correlation length ) while keeping the microscopic lengths ( e.g.  the lattice spacing ) unchanged .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for a more thorough explanation of this . ) the limiting theory at the critical point should then appear as a fixed point for these transformations , called the _ scaling limit_. polyakov famously argued in @xcite that the scaling limit should be distinguished by invariance with respect to local conformal transformations .",
    "this paper established the link between the study of phase transitions and _ conformal field theory _",
    "( cft ) .",
    "in @xcite , belavin , polyakov , and zamolodchikov showed that certain simple cft s called _ minimal models _ could be solved completely in terms of ( and so are determined by ) a hilbert space made of a finite number of  discrete series \" ( unitary , irreducible ) representations of the virasoro algebra , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  7 ) for more details .",
    "these representations are characterized by the eigenvalue @xmath55 assigned to the central element , called the _ central charge _ , which can be computed directly from the scaling limit of the statistical model .",
    "this works out beautifully in the case of the critical 1-dimensional quantum ising model : in that case , the central charge is @xmath56 , the minimal model is built from the three discrete series representations of the virasoro algebra with that central charge , and this cft exactly matches the ising phase transition , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "e ) , @xcite , or @xcite for details .",
    "the discrete series representations mentioned above are described by @xmath55 and another parameter @xmath57 which have some relations between them , and there are tight constraints on the possible values of @xmath55 and @xmath57 to be unitary @xcite . to prove that all of these values of @xmath55 and @xmath57 indeed correspond to irreducible unitary representations ,",
    "one employs the _ coset construction _ of goddard , kent , and olive , see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "this construction produces such representations by restricting representations of an affine lie algebra , i.e. , a central extension of the ( infinite - dimensional ) loop algebra of a compact lie algebra @xmath48 .",
    "using the coset construction , there are two ways to obtain the @xmath58 minimal model that applies to our zero - field ising model : we could use either of the compact lie algebras @xmath59 or @xmath0 as the base @xmath48 for the affine lie algebra ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ,  18.4.1 ) .",
    "these two algebras are the only choices that lead to @xmath58 @xcite .    of course",
    ", the appearance of @xmath0 here is somewhat incidental .",
    "the minimal model could be described purely in terms of virasoro representations , without reference to either @xmath59 or @xmath0 .",
    "as we explain below , @xmath0 only takes center stage when we consider a perturbation of the critical ising model as in .",
    "in a 1989 article @xcite , zamolodchikov investigated the field theory for a model equivalent to the 1-dimensional quantum ising model , in the vicinity of the critical point , but perturbed by a small magnetic field directed along the preferential spin axis . in other words , he considered the field theory model corresponding to ( [ hmag ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath61 very small . note the change of perspective : for zamolodchikov @xmath23 is fixed and the perturbation consists of a small change in the value of @xmath61 .",
    "but in the cobalt niobate experiment , this magnetic `` perturbation '' is already built - in  it is the purely internal effect arising from the inter - chain interactions as we described in  [ adapt.sec ] .",
    "the experimenters ca nt control the strength of the internal field , they only vary @xmath23 . fortunately , the internal magnetic field @xmath61 turns out to be relatively weak , so when the external field @xmath23 is tuned close to the critical value the experimental model matches the situation considered by zamolodchidkov .",
    "the qualitative features of the particle spectrum for the magnetically perturbed ising model had been predicted by mccoy and wu @xcite .",
    "those earlier calculations show a large number of stable particles for small @xmath23 , with the number decreasing as @xmath23 approaches @xmath62 .",
    "zamolodchikov s paper makes some predictions for the masses of these particles at @xmath63 .    as we noted above",
    ", the @xmath58 minimal model is the conformal field theory associated with the phase transition of the unperturbed quantum ising model .",
    "the perturbed field theory is no longer a conformal field theory , but zamolodchikov found six local integrals of motion for the perturbed field theory and conjectured that these were the start of an infinite series . on this basis",
    ", he made the fundamental conjecture :    1 .",
    "[ z0 ] the perturbation gives an integrable field theory .",
    "one implication of is that the resulting scattering theory should be `` purely elastic , '' meaning that the number of particles and their individual momenta would be conserved asymptotically .",
    "zamolodchikov combined this purely elastic scattering assumption with three rather mild assumptions on the particle interactions of the theory @xcite :    1 .   [ z1 ]",
    "there are at least 2 particles , say @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "[ z2 ] both @xmath64 and @xmath65 appear as bound - state poles on the scattering amplitude for two @xmath64 s .",
    "[ z3 ] the particle @xmath64 appears as a bound - state pole in the scattering amplitude between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "assumptions and merely assert that certain coupling constants that govern the interparticle interactions are non - zero , so they could be viewed as an assumption of some minimum level of interaction between the two particles .",
    "the word  particle \" bears some explaining here , because it is being used here in the sense of quantum field theory : a stable excitation of the system with distinguishable particle - like features such as mass and momentum .",
    "however , it is important to note that the continuum limit of the ising model is made to look like a field theory only through the application of a certain transformation ( jordan - wigner , see @xcite ) , that makes `` kink '' states ( boundaries between regions of differing spin ) the basic objects of the theory .",
    "so zamolodchikov s particles are nt electrons or ions .",
    "the field theory excitations presumably correspond to highly complicated aggregate spin states of the original system . on the statistical physics side",
    "the usual term for this kind of excitation is _",
    "quasiparticle_. in the experiment these quasiparticles are detected just as ordinary particles would be , by measuring the reaction to a beam of neutrons .    from the mild assumptions  , he showed that the simplest purely elastic scattering theory consistent with the integrals of motion contains 8 particles with masses listed in table [ masses ] .",
    "( see @xcite for more background on these calculations . )",

    "so it can be difficult to judge from the appearance of a lie algebra in the physics literature if any particular form of the algebra is being singled out .    nevertheless , the algebras appearing here are the compact ones .",

    "in fact , the field theories based on these other algebras do have interesting connections to statistical models .",

    "clebsch - gordan \" necessary condition for the coupling of particles , see @xcite .",
    "we remark that these fusing rules are currently only theoretical ",
    "it is not clear how they could be tested experimentally .",
    "let s get back to the cobalt niobate experiment .",
    "as we noted above , when the external magnetic field is very close to the critical value that induces the phase transition , it was expected that the experimental system would be modeled by the critical 1-dimensional quantum ising model perturbed by a small magnetic field directed along the preferential axis .",
    "this model is the subject of zamolodchikov s perturbation theory , and the resulting field theory has been identified as the @xmath0 atft .    to test this association , the experimenters conducted neutron scattering experiments on the magnet .",
    "figure  [ intensity.fig ] shows an intensity plot of scattered neutrons averaged over a range of scattering angles .",
    "observations were actually made at a series of external field strengths , from 4.0 tesla ( t ) to 5.0 t , with the second peak better resolved at the lower energies .",
    "both peaks track continuously as the field strength is varied .",
    "figure  [ intensity.fig ] represents the highest field strength at which the second peak could be resolved .",
    "the two peaks give evidence of the existence of at least two particles in the system , which was one of zamolodchikov s core assumptions . and",
    "indeed , the ratio of the masses appears to approach the golden ratio ",
    "see figure [ ratio.fig]as the critical value ( about 5.5 t ) is approached , just as zamolodchikov predicted twenty years earlier .     of the masses of the two lightest particles",
    "approaches the golden ratio as the transverse magnetic field approaches critical strength of 5.5 tesla . ]",
    "we can also compare the relative intensities of the first two mass peaks to the theoretical predictions exhibited in figure [ predicted.fig ] . here again we see approximate agreement between the observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "the figure shows a threshold at @xmath125 , where a continuous spectrum is generated by the scattering of the lightest particle with itself .",
    "particles with masses at or above this threshold will be very difficult to detect , as their energy signature is expected to consist of rather small peaks that overlap with the @xmath125 continuum .",
    "hence the fact that only two particles out of eight were observed is again consistent with the theoretical model .",
    "we can now finally address the question from the title of this paper , slightly rephrased : did the experimenters detect @xmath0 ?",
    "first we should say that they themselves do not claim to have done so . rather , they claim to have found experimental evidence for the theory developed by zamolodchikov , et al , and described above  which we shall call below simply _",
    "zamolodchikov s theory_and that this in turn means giving evidence for @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the argument for these claims goes as follows .",
    "the @xmath0 atft is an integrable field theory describing the magnetically perturbed ising model and satisfying . in that situation , zamolodchikov and delfino - mussardo made some numerical predictions regarding the relative masses of the particles and relative intensities of the scattering peaks .",
    "the experimental data show two peaks , but the second peak is only resolved at lower energies",
    ". the ratios of masses and intensities are certainly consistent with the theoretical predictions , although the ratios appear to be measured only rather roughly .    at this point , we want to address three objections to this line of argument that we heard when giving talks on the subject .",
    "we heard the following objection : experiments can never provide evidence for a scientific theory , they can only provide evidence against it .",
    "( this viewpoint is known as _",
    "falsificationism_. ) this is of course preposterous .",
    "science only progresses through the acceptance of theories that have survived enough good experimental tests , even if the words  enough \" and  good \" are open to subjective interpretations .",
    "a less extreme version of this same objection is : confirmatory experimental results are automatically suspect in view of notorious historical examples of experimenter s bias such as cold fusion and n - rays .",
    "this sort of objection is better addressed to the experimental physics community , which as a whole is certainly familiar with these specific examples and with the general issue of experimenter s bias . as far as we know",
    ", no such criticisms have been raised concerning the methods described in @xcite .",
    "recall that the experimental results can be summarized as a limited set of numbers which approximately agree with the theoretical predictions . based on this",
    ", we have heard the following objection : if you start by looking at this small amount of data , how can you claim to have pinned down something as complex as @xmath0 ?",
    "this question contains its own answer .",
    "one does nt analyze the results of the experiment by examining the data , divorced from all previous experience and theoretical framework .",
    "instead , humanity already knows a lot about so - called critical point phenomena and there is a substantial theoretical model that is expected to describe the behavior of the magnet .",
    "the experiment described in @xcite was a test of the relevance and accuracy of zamolodchikov s theory , not an investigation of magnets beginning from no knowledge at all .    to put it another way , someone who approaches science from the viewpoint of this objector",
    "would necessarily reject many results from experimental physics that are based on similar sorts of indirect evidence . to give just one example of such a result , the reported observations of the top quark in @xcite and @xcite were not direct observations but rather confirmations of theoretical predictions made under the assumption that the top quark exists .",
    "if you examine the papers @xcite by zamolodchikov and @xcite by delfino and mussardo , you see that the numerical predictions are made without invoking @xmath0 . at this point",
    ", one might object that @xmath0 is not strictly necessary for the theoretical model .",
    "but , as we explained in",
    " [ zam.sec ] , the role of @xmath0 in the theory is that by employing it , zamolodchikov s _ assumption _ is turned into a _",
    "deduction_. that is , by including @xmath0 , we reduce the number of assumptions and achieve a more concise theoretical model .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 version of the theory justifies the amazing numerological coincidences between zamolodchikov s calculations and the @xmath0 root system .",
    "finally , we should address the distinction between  detecting @xmath0 \" and  finding evidence for @xmath0 symmetry \" . while the former is pithier , we re only talking about the latter here .",
    "the reason is that , as far as we know , there is no direct correspondence between @xmath0 and any physical object .",
    "this is in contrast , for example , to the case of the gauge group @xmath126 of the strong force in the standard model in particle physics .",
    "one can meaningfully identify basis vectors of the lie algebra @xmath127 with gluons , the mediators of the strong force , which have been observed in the laboratory . with this distinction in mind",
    ", our view is that the experiment can not be said to have detected @xmath0 , but that it has provided evidence for zamolodchikov s theory and hence for @xmath0 symmetry as claimed in @xcite .",
    "the experiment with the cobalt niobate magnet consisted of two phases . in the first phase",
    ", the experimenters verified that in the absence of an external magnetic field , the 1-dimensional quantum ising model accurately describes the spin dynamics , as predicted by theorists . in the second phase",
    ", the experimenters added an external magnetic field directed transverse to the spins preferred axis , and tuned this field close to the value required to reach the quantum critical regime .",
    "in that situation , zamolodchikov , et al , had predicted the existence of 8 distinct types of particles in a field theory governed by the compact lie algebra @xmath0 .",
    "the experimenters observed the two smallest particles and confirmed two numerical predictions : the ratio of the masses of the two smallest particles ( predicted by zamolodchikov ) and the ratio of the intensities corresponding to those two particles ( predicted by delfino - mussardo ) . in this article , we have focused on the @xmath0 side of the story because @xmath0 is a mathematical celebrity .",
    "but there is a serious scientific reason to be interested in the experiment apart from @xmath0 : it is the first experimental test of the perturbed conformal field theory constructed by zamolodchikov around 1990 .",
    "also , it is the first laboratory realization of the critical state of the quantum 1-dimensional ising model in such a way that it can be manipulated  the experimenters can continuously vary the transverse field strength @xmath23 in across a wide range while preserving the 1-dimensional character  and the results observed directly .",
