    "different numerical methods have been designed to approximate the invariant sets  @xcite or to compute specific properties such as the fractal dimension  @xcite . while the success of these methods for systems with a single positive lyapunov exponent ( @xmath22 is well established , for the challenging case of hyperchaotic systems the most popular  @xcite and efficient solution is the stagger - and - step method proposed by sweet and yorke in 2001  @xcite . here",
    "we revisit the core problem of all these methods , which can be formulated as follows : starting from a point @xmath8 with escape - time @xmath17 , the task is to search a new point @xmath23 with higher escape - time @xmath24 .",

    "this is justified by the notion that the points that escape at time @xmath17 are the @xmath17-th pre - images of a suitably defined escape region , and thus the size of its pre - images decrease exponentially with the maximum lyapunov exponent  @xcite .",
    "the stagger proposal  ( [ eq.stagger ] ) is independent of @xmath17 and does not explore this regularity ( right panel of fig .",
