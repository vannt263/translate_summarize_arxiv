    "complex top - down electronic nanostructures with a large number of local gates have become of great interest , e.g. , for experiments in gate defined quantum rings@xcite or double - quantum dots@xcite with charge detectors , to study possible majorana fermions in semiconducting nanowires,@xcite or to form and shape qds on suspended carbon nanotubes , giving control over the coupling between the electrical and the mechanical degrees of freedom.@xcite    local control of the device parameters is also essential in a device for cooper pair splitting ( cps ) .",

    "the electrons in a superconductor form spin - singlet cooper pairs which can be separated ( split ) coherently into n1 and n2 by the interactions on the qds , resulting in a stream of spatially separated entangled electron pairs.@xcite experimental evidence for correlated currents have been reported recently for devices based on inas nanowires ( nws)@xcite and carbon nanotubes,@xcite with efficiencies up to 90%.@xcite the cps efficiency and the relevant physical processes depend strongly on the tunnel couplings , which were determined in previous devices by poorly controlled details in the fabrication process .",
    "a maximum cps efficiency is expected for a reasonably strong tunnel coupling of the qds to the normal contacts and a weaker coupling to s , and for a large , sharp energy gap in the superconductor.@xcite    here we present experiments on an inas nw cps device fabricated on top of an array of narrow bottom gates .",
    "these gates allow us to form qds at different positions and to tune individually and in - situ the qd - lead tunnel couplings , the chemical potentials of the qds and the inter - dot coupling.@xcite the superconducting contact is made of nb , which has a @xmath0 times larger bulk energy gap than al , the superconductor used in most previous experiments . in the presented transport experiments we find that the correlation between the conductances of the two qds depends strongly on the gate configurations .",
    "in particular , we tune the barriers on the normal and the superconductor side of the qds , as well as the inter - dot coupling between two dots , each inducing a transition from positive to negative correlations .",
    "we qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings in a semi - classical rate equation model and attribute the observed transitions in the conductance correlations to the competition between the different transport processes on qds with a finite average population .",

    "first , using electron - beam lithography , an array of twelve local gates was fabricated on a highly doped silicon substrate that serves as a global backgate , insulated by @xmath5 nm sio@xmath6 .",

    "the experiments were carried out in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature @xmath18mk . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1]b , we applied a sinusoidal voltage @xmath19v to the superconductor s and simultaneously recorded the resulting variations of the currents in the contacts n1 and n2 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , using current - voltage ( iv ) converters and lock - in amplifiers .",
    "we define the differential conductances through qd @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "the lever arms of the different gates were found by bias spectroscopy experiments , applying a dc voltage to s. if not stated otherwise , all presented experiments were done at zero dc bias , which was achieved by compensating offsets in the iv - converters by external voltage sources ( not shown in fig .",

    "the lever arms obtained from similar experiments with the other gates suggest that qd1 is indeed formed between g1 and g3 . at low bias",
    "some resonances occur , reminiscent of andreev bound states,@xcite which suggests a relatively strong coupling to s and a weaker coupling to n1 . from these states",
    "we deduce an effective superconducting energy gap on or near qd1 on the order of @xmath26ev .",
    "this gap considerably smaller than the bulk value of nb ( @xmath27mev,@xcite ) , possibly due to the strong suppression of the proximity induced gap expected for relatively thick semiconducting nws.@xcite as shown in fig .",

    "cooper pair splitting is a a nonlocal two - particle process and leads to a nonlocal signal , i.e. , a signal that depends on the transmissions of both qds .",
    "experimentally , we investigate the change of conductance in one qd when the other dot is brought into resonance.@xcite competing processes , e.g. , the sequential tunneling of cooper pairs through the same qd ( local pair tunneling ) , are local in nature and depend intrinsically only on the settings of one qd . the aim of this work is to investigate the evolution of the nonlocal signal in a cps device when one tunnel barrier of a qd is varied .",
    "in this section we tune the local gate g1 to change the tunnel coupling of qd1 to lead n1 . due to the close proximity of g1 to the center of qd1",
    ", this also changes the chemical potential of the dot , which we compensate using the local gate g2 ( tuning gate ) .",
    "this procedure allows us to compare the same coulomb blockade ( cb ) resonance for different tunnel barrier strengths .",

    "the reduction of the cb resonance widths and amplitudes suggests a variation of the involved tunnel barrier . intuitively , g1 tunes @xmath30 , i.e. , the single electron tunnel coupling to n1 .",
    "we expect that @xmath30 decreases when @xmath31 is made more negative , i.e. , from @xmath31-position i in fig .",
    "[ figure2]a to position iv .",
    "however , on a larger gate voltage scale the modulation of the resonance amplitude exhibits more than a single maximum , in contrast to what one might expect from tuning a simple tunnel barrier in a transport broadened qd . we attribute this experimental finding to the fact that the gates also tune other parts of the device , though by a considerably smaller lever arm .    to investigate the nonlocal signals in the cps device , we simultaneously record @xmath24 and @xmath32 as a function of the tuning gates g2 and g9 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ figure2]a , g9 tunes qd2 through the three resonances r1 , r2 and r3 .",
    "the resonances of the two qds run perpendicular in these plots , which shows that the capacitive cross talk between the qds is very small .",
    "though not shown , we note that the conductance through qd1 and qd2 in series does not exhibit anti - crossings , which suggests that the inter - dot tunnel coupling is considerably smaller than the life - time broadening of the cb resonances .",
    "the amplitude of one qd resonance is independent of the gate voltage applied to the other qd , except where both qds become resonant with the fermi energy in the leads . in fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ( configuration i ) both conductances increase at these resonance crossings,@xcite for which we use the term _ positive correlation _ between the conductance variations in the qds .",
    "this positive correlation is characteristic for cps,@xcite as we discuss in more detail below .",
    "similar gate sweeps over the same resonances in configuration iv are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure2]c .",
    "while the qd2 resonances are similar as in setting i , the ( local ) conductance of qd1 is decreased by about an order of magnitude due to the increased barrier strength .",
    "focusing on the resonance crossings one finds that the amplitudes of the qd1 resonances are _ reduced _ at the resonance crossings , while the qd2 resonances still exhibit an increased conductance , which results in a _ negative _ conductance correlation between the two qds , in contrast to gate configuration i. the nonlocal signal on qd2 only changes in amplitude , but not in sign .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the origin of these dips to section vi and only point out that 1 ) the qd1 conductance away from the qd2 resonances is determined by the local processes and changes significantly between the gate configurations i - iv , as expected if the tunnel barrier strength is varied .",
    "2 ) different neighboring qd states of similar amplitudes and widths can exhibit different conductance correlations ( not shown ) , excluding electrostatic effects .",
    "also resistive cross talk@xcite can be excluded as the origin of the observed effects because it would lead to a dip in both conductances at a resonance crossing .",
    "the evolution from a positive to a negative conductance correlation with the voltage on the local gate g1 can be followed better in fig .",
    "[ figure2]d , where the amplitude of the qd1 resonance l1 is plotted as a function of the voltage applied to qd2-gate g9 , @xmath4 , for the four @xmath31-settings indicated in fig .",

    "we observe three peaks where g9 tunes qd2 through the resonances r1-r3 and label each crossing by the two respective resonances , e.g. ( l1,r1 ) for the gate configuration where l1 and r1 are both resonant .",
    "the conductance variation on these crossings are similar for the settings i and ii , but decrease significantly for setting iii . for configuration iv , we find a dip instead of a peak at the resonance crossings .",
    "for all four curves the local conductance background and the nonlocal conductance variations both decrease with more negative @xmath31 .",
    "we note that no offsets are subtracted in fig .",
    "[ figure2]d and curve iv is multiplied by @xmath33 .",
    "the evolution of the nonlocal signal on qd1 has to be compared to the one on qd2 : in fig .",
    "[ figure2]e the amplitude of the qd2 resonance r1 is plotted for the same @xmath31-settings",
    "because the local conductance background is almost identical for all curves , ii - iv are offset for clarity .",
    "for all four gate configurations we find a peak in the conductance as r1 crosses l1 and l2 .",
    "with decreasing @xmath31 , the conductance variation at the resonance crossings increases in amplitude by almost a factor of 2 between i and iv .    as a measure for the cps efficiency we use @xmath34 , which essentially compares the fraction of currents due to cps to the total current in the system.@xcite",
    "if the conductance variations are the same in both qds , one obtains a conservative estimate for @xmath35 by setting @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the conductance variations on the resonance crossings .",
    "this is applicable for the @xmath31-setting i , for which we find , for example for the resonance crossing ( l1,r2 ) , an efficiency of @xmath3817% .",
    "clearly , we can not use this approximation for the cases ii - iv . to describe the transition from a positive to a negative correlation of the qd conductances one might also use the _ visibility _ of the nonlocal signal in one branch of the cps device , which is defined as @xmath39 at a resonance crossing.@xcite for the resonance crossing ( l1,r2 ) we find that @xmath40 decreases from @xmath41% to about @xmath42% when @xmath31 is tuned from configuration i to iv , while @xmath43 increases from @xmath44% to @xmath45% . the evolution of the visibilities directly illustrates the sign change of the conductance correlations between the two qds when the tunnel coupling of qd1 to n1 is reduced .",

    "[ figure1]b .",
    "the exact gate voltages used to form the qds are given in the appendix.@xcite we show that a transition from a positive to a negative conductance correlation between the qds can be induced by increasing the tunnel coupling of qd2 to s , similar as in section iii for a decreasing coupling of qd1 to n1 . for simplicity ,",

    "similarly as discussed for @xmath30 in the previous section , this probably corresponds to a stronger barrier and a weaker coupling @xmath46 to s. the two vertical lines labeled v and vi are the two @xmath47-settings for which we now investigate the nonlocal signals .",

    "we use barrier gate g8 to also tune the chemical potential of qd2 , and similarly gate g4 to tune qd1 . the aim is to investigate the effect of the gates g6 and g7 _ below _ the superconducting contact s on the conductance correlations in the cps device .",
    "because of the finite size of the nw and despite the screening by the superconductor , we expect that the electron density below s is reduced when the gates are set to more negative potentials , which should lead to a reduction of the single electron tunneling rate between the qds . in fig .",
    "[ figure4]a the amplitude of a qd1 resonance ( @xmath24 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath47 , i.e. , the gate defining qd2 , for a series of voltages applied to the gates below s. in all experiments we set @xmath51 .",
    "for the same voltages on @xmath54 and @xmath55 the amplitude of a qd2 resonance ( @xmath32 ) is plotted in fig .  [ figure4]b as a function of @xmath53 , i.e. a gate of qd1 .",
    "the respective four curves in figs .",
    "[ figure4]a and [ figure4]b have the same ( local ) background conductance within experimental error and are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "this suggests that the tunnel barriers to the source and drain contacts are not significantly altered by the gates g6 and g7 .",
    "in addition , the curves are shifted horizontally , so that the resonance crossings are centered at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "this is necessary because these gates affect the resonance position of both qds by a small capacitive coupling . for @xmath58",
    "the nonlocal signal on qd1 is positive , but negative on qd2 , so that we find a negative conductance correlation at the resonance crossing .",
    "when we continuously tune both gate voltages to more negative values , the nonlocal signal on qd2 at the resonance crossing evolves from negative to positive values , while the signal on qd1 is only slightly reduced . at @xmath59v",
    "we find a positive correlation and similar amplitudes for the qd conductances .",
    "the visibilities in the two arms evolve with decreasing voltage from @xmath60% and @xmath61% at @xmath58 to @xmath62% and @xmath63% at @xmath59v .",
    "in the experiments presented above we find large qualitative and quantitative differences in the conductance variations for different crossings of resonances of the two qds .",
    "these ` nonlocal ' signals are surprisingly simple to tune from a positive to a negative correlation .",
    "in fact , we can induce such transitions by using any single local barrier gate . in this section",
    "we present a simple toy model ( similar to the one in ref .  ) , which qualitatively describes the experimental findings and allows to identify the physical mechanisms that could lead to the observed transitions in the conductance correlations .",
    "a more involved model can be found , for example , in ref .  .",
    "the two basic ideas are that 1 ) both , the local and nonlocal processes depend on the qd occupations , which couples the resulting rates , and 2 ) a finite inter - dot coupling can lead to electrons tunneling between the qds , i.e. , a local process that depends on the occupation of both qds ."
