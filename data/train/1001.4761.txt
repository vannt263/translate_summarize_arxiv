    "<S> this technique derives its power from the fact that the precise value of the core level binding energy depends on the chemical environment of the emitting atoms , but it is tacitly assumed that it has a single , well - defined energy , i.e. it does not show any dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> violations of this assumption have only been found for small molecules in the gas phase such as c@xmath2h@xmath2 or n@xmath2 with much stronger bonding and shorter bonding distances than present in solids @xcite . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2 ] therefore shows a much more extensive data set measured over many polar and azimuthal angles and at different photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> again , a good fit to all the spectra in the data set was obtained for a single c @xmath0 component using always the same line shape . </S>",

    "<S> the agreement between experiment and calculation is excellent .    </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy modulation , on the other hand , is shown as a function of @xmath8 , the wave - vector component parallel to the surface , which is the only relevant wave - vector for a two - dimensional system like graphene . </S>",
    "<S> as the portion of the reciprocal space covered by the experiment increases at higher photon energies , a periodic pattern emerges which , however , does not coincide with the reciprocal lattice mesh . at the origin ( @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy is always close to its maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments at @xmath10  ev and 500  ev show that the binding energy takes its maximum value also at the next - nearest neighbor reciprocal lattice points , while the experiments at 600 and 700 ev show that this occurs again at the next - nearest neighbors of these latter points . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , at all the other reciprocal lattice points the binding energy takes its minimum value . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic pattern , therefore , is described with two complementary sublattices : the binding energy is at its maximum value at all the points connected by vectors that are @xmath11 times longer than the primitive vectors and rotated by 30@xmath7 , and it is at its minimum value at all the other reciprocal lattice points .    . </S>",

    "<S> the green crosses correspond to the reciprocal lattice points of graphene , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ to the @xmath12 points . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=312 ] +    there are , in principle , several different mechanisms which could lead to the observed binding energy variations . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the existence of several unresolved components which change their relative intensity due to a final state effect ( photoelectron diffraction ) and thereby mimic a peak - shift . </S>",
    "<S> this appears highly unlikely in the present case , not only because of the excellent agreement with the intensity calculation for a single component , but also because a peak shift of the observed magnitude would essentially require a complete supression of peak intensities in certain directions , and this is unrealistic for a usual photoelectron diffraction - type modulation . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be very unlikely that the mechanism leads to a binding energy modulation which is periodic _ in reciprocal space _ , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the second possible explanation is a recoil effect in which some of the photoelectron s energy is used to excite lattice vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been reported for photoemission from the graphite c @xmath0 state @xcite . for increasing photon energies </S>",
    "<S> it leads to a decreasing apparent binding energy since some of the photoelectron s energy remains with the emitting atom . </S>",
    "<S> the effect can be of considerable size , several hundred mev for photon energies of several kev , but its magnitude should be insignificant for the low energies used here . </S>",
    "<S> one would not expect it to lead to any periodic modulation either .    </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a third possibility which is an initial state effect , _ i. e. _ a band - like dispersion of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest conceivable picture for this is the formation of a @xmath13-type band between the 1@xmath14 states of the two atoms in the unit cell of graphene , highlighted in orange in the sketch of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> a tight - binding calculation of such a band is shown in fig . [ fig:3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute binding energy and the band width are arbitrarily chosen to mimic those observed here . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion shows two bands with the highest energy separation at @xmath12 and degeneracy at the @xmath15 point of the two - dimensional brillouin zone . in the following we refer to these bands , somewhat loosely , as the bonding and the anti - bonding band .    on the face of it </S>",
    "<S> , it appears hard to reconcile such a dispersion with the experimental observation , as one would expect to observe a single , narrow c @xmath0 peak at @xmath15 and a broad or even split peak at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly not supported by the data . also , the @xmath13-band should be periodic in reciprocal space , _ </S>",
    "<S> e. g. _ the peak position and width should be the same at all @xmath12 points . according to the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , this is not the case either . </S>",
    "<S> most of the @xmath12 points marked in the figure appear close to either a maximum or a minimum in the binding energy but clearly the observed periodicity is not the same as that of the reciprocal lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of band dispersion and the experimental data can , however , be reconciled when taking into account a curious interference effect which is caused by the presence of two atoms in the unit cell of graphene . in the most simple picture , </S>",
    "<S> this interference can be interpreted as a type of young s double slit phenomenon in which the two atoms in the unit cell act as electron sources . </S>",
    "<S> the effect has been studied in detail for the valence band of graphite and graphene @xcite .    as an illustration of the interference effect </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the expected photoemission intensities for all the anti - bonding and all the bonding states . </S>",
    "<S> the results are given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) and ( c ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the interference effect is evident : in the first brillouin zone , for instance , emission from the anti - bonding states is entirely suppressed while it is intense from the bonding states . in the neighboring zones it is the other way round . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ( d)-(f ) show the emission intensity for smaller energy windows at the top of the anti - bonding band , at the bottom of the bonding band , and just below the dirac point at @xmath15 . in the last case </S>",
    "<S> , a constant energy contour shows a triangular shape , as expected for the non - linear dispersion away from @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the photoemission intensity around this triangular contour shows strong variations which are caused by the interference effect and very similar to the results obtained for the valence @xmath16-band of graphite and graphene @xcite .    as already expected from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) and ( c ) , the interference effect is even stronger for emission from the bonding and anti - bonding states at @xmath12 ( see fig . [ fig:3](d ) and ( e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity variations of both bands are almost opposite to each other : for some @xmath12 points only the bonding band is observed , for others only the anti - bonding band . for normal emission </S>",
    "<S> this is easy to understand : for the bonding band the wave functions centred on the two atoms in the unit cell emit in phase and this band is observed . </S>",
    "<S> for the anti - bonding wave function , the two atomic wave functions emit out of phase , thus suppressing the photoemission .    </S>",
    "<S> -type band formed from the c  @xmath0 core states in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the bonding ( blue ) and anti - bonding ( red ) bands are degenerate at @xmath15 and show the highest splitting at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the brillouin zone of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( c ) calculated photoemission intensity from all the anti - bonding and bonding states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the grey - scale is chosen such that bright corresponds to high intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the green crosses mark the reciprocal lattice of graphene and the green hexagon the first brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> ( d)-(f ) calculated photoemission intensity from the states in the binding energy windows indicated by the small circles in ( a ) . note the similarity of the emission pattern from the bonding states in ( d ) with the positions of maximum binding energy in the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=312 ] +    the presence of the interference effect easily reconciles the hypothesis of a @xmath13-band formation with the data . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it explains the fact that the peak shape is similar for all emission directions . for emission near @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> the peak is narrow because of the degeneracy of the bands at @xmath15 . at </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 points the peak is also narrow , in contrast to naive expectation , because it does not show both the bonding and the anti - bonding bands but rather only one of them at every given @xmath12 point . </S>",
    "<S> the interference effect is also responsible for the apparently incorrect periodicity of the band dispersion in reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is not such that all @xmath12 points are equivalent , because one either observes emission from the bonding or from the anti - bonding band . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sign of the observed modulation is consistent with this interpretation , too . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of the peak observed at normal emission is close to the global maximum of the entire data set , consistent with emission from the bonding @xmath13-band . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the calculated emission from the bonding band shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](d ) can be compared directly to the plot of the apparent binding energy in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , which is also scaled such that high binding energies are bright .    </S>",
    "<S> the size of the bonding / anti - bonding splitting in graphene can be inferred from the difference of observed binding energies at inequivalent @xmath12 points . combing all the available data from @xmath12 points showing either the bonding or the anti - bonding band , we evaluate the size of the splitting to be @xmath17  mev . </S>",
    "<S> we can compare this value to the size of the bonding / anti - bonding splitting in small carbon - containing molecules such as c@xmath2h@xmath2 ( c - c distance of 1.2   , splitting of 105  mev @xcite ) and c@xmath2h@xmath18 ( c - c distance of 1.34    expected splitting of 20 - 30  mev @xcite ) if we assume that the matrix element for hopping between the core electrons on the two carbon atoms depends exponentially on the c - c distance and that the size of the splitting scales linearly with the number of nearest neighbors . assuming a splitting of 105  mev and 25  mev for c@xmath2h@xmath2 and c@xmath2h@xmath18 , respectively </S>",
    "<S> , we would expect a total bandwidth of @xmath130  mev for graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the observed magnitude of the dispersion is somewhat larger but in the right order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from the fundamental importance of our results for the bonding in solids , a dependence of the core level binding energy on the emission angle can have implications for the interpretation of high - resolution core level data from graphene , graphite and related materials . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute magnitude of the binding energy variation observed here is appreciable compared with usual chemical shifts and could easily be interpreted incorrectly . in a limited data </S>",
    "<S> set , for instance , an apparent shift of the c  @xmath0 peak as a function of polar emission angle might be mistaken for signs of a surface core level shift in graphite because of the higher surface sensitivity for off - normal emission . </S>",
    "<S> ignoring dispersion effects might play some role in the recent dispute about the existence of a surface core level shift in graphite @xcite , but note that the interference effect reported here is inconsistent with the observation of multiple c  @xmath0 components . here </S>",
    "<S> we can state that to a good approximation either the bonding or the anti - bonding band can be observed in any given emission direction .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the interaction between the two atoms in the unit cell of graphene is sufficiently strong to induce the formation of a @xmath13-band derived from the carbon @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> interference effects in the photoemission process give rise to a strong suppression of either the bonding or the anti - bonding band for different emission directions , such that the absolute size of the splitting could be determined from the entire data set . </S>",
    "<S> the interference effect furthermore allows to observe only the bonding or the anti - bonding states under certain conditions , opening the unique opportunity for detailed and possibly local as well as time - resolved studies of bonding in solids . </S>"
