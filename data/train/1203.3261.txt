    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are huge explosions of magnetized plasma from the sun .",
    "their interplanetary counterparts , interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) , are considered to be the main driver of geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "the major scientific objective of the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo )",
    "mission @xcite launched in october 2006 is to better understand the initiation and propagation of cmes .",
    "a big advantage of the stereo twin spacecraft is that they allow a simultaneous observation of a cme from two different perspectives .",
    "quite a number of papers have been dedicated to the 3d reconstructions of cmes based on the coronagraph observations of the stereo spacecraft .",
    "different reconstruction methods of coronagraph observations have been used in the past . among them",
    "are forward modeling , triangulation method , polarisation ratio method .",
    "a review on these methods can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a combination of forward and inverse method to estimate the cme mass distribution .    in this paper",
    ", we are aiming to obtain the 3d morphology of a cme by using the coronagraph observations from three viewpoints .",
    "unlike forward modeling where a restricted family of geometrical cme shapes is assumed beforehand , our method allows any a - priori shape of a cme . for tie - point approaches , the identification of corresponding structures from different views",
    "is required but is often difficult to achieve .",
    "the method described in the current work does not have this problem .",
    "the polarisation ratio method utilises the polarising properties of the thomson scattering . in principle",
    ", only one view is required .",
    "however , the information returned is only a depth surface representative of the scattering centres in the cme cloud along the line - of - sight .",
    "no information about the depth distribution can be retrieved . moreover",
    ", the resulting plane bears the ambiguity of two symmetric solutions with respect to the plane of sky .",
    "the combination of forward and inverse methods of @xcite also uses a forward modelling step essentially based on family of flux rope cme models . in a second step ,",
    "the flux rope 3d volume is then used as the support for an inverse estimation of the density distribution of the cme .",
    "the latter step , however , is heavily under constrained and multiple solutions are possible .    along with the very large variety of coronagraph reconstruction techniques , 3d geometric reconstructions using heliospheric imagers",
    "have also been developed by some authors , where a cme was treated as a complete volume rather than a point source .",
    "for example , @xcite used a 3d magneto - hydrodynamic code to disentangle observational from physical effects . by comparing the simulation with the observations from coronagraph and heliospheric images , the 3d nature of two successive cmes and their evolution in the inner heliosphere",
    "were studied .",
    "@xcite compared their model of interplanetary disturbances with heliospheric image data from the solar mass ejection imager . by identifying the simulated icme",
    "that best matched the observations , they obtained the parameters that can describe icme s 3d leading - edge structure , orientation and kinematics .",
    "the cme localisation and morphology in 3d yield information about the cme s orientation , propagation direction , angular width in longitude and latitude etc . and help to make reliable predictions about the arrival time of a cme at earth or other planets .",
    "reversely , in - situ observations can be combined with near - sun 3d reconstructions to constrain the cme model a - posteriori .",
    "such investigations aimed to study cme propagation properties in the interplanetary space have been performed by some authors , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated a cme observed between sun and venus using the stereo , _ venus express _",
    "( vex ) and messenger data .",
    "they compared the ( i)cme orientation obtained by white light analysis with the in situ flux rope axis by messenger and vex .",
    "the cme orientation in the stereo / cor2 field of view ( fov ) was derived by a fit of the graduated cylindrical shell ( gcs ) model @xcite . due to the limited separation angle at the time of these observations ,",
    "the gcs flux rope was only fitted to cor2 a. early work before the stereo era devoted to the comparison of the orientation of the source region neutral line , the cme cloud shape in coronagraph images and the flux rope axis orientation from in situ measurements have been made by @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a new method for the reconstruction of the cme cloud based on the back projection of the observed cme periphery in multiple coronagraph images without any restriction by a predefined class of cme shapes . from the superposition of these back projections ,",
    "we obtain a 3d volume which must contain the cme cloud entirely .",
    "reversely , the real cme cloud also must fill this 3d volume in the sense that the cloud has to touch each wall of the 3d volume somewhere . based on these principles , we propose a scheme to obtain an approximation to the real 3d cme cloud shape . since the problem of 3d reconstruction from 2d images is notoriously under constrained , we have designed our scheme so as to incorporate images from as many different view directions as possible .",
    "in the application presented here , coronagraph data from three spacecraft were used .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 , the coronagraph observations from three vantage points , stereo a & b , and soho are described .",
    "details of our reconstruction method are presented in  3 . in  4",
    ", we use the 3d morphology obtained from our reconstruction to interpret in - situ magnetic field and plasma parameters observed during the passage of the cme near venus , earth , and two stereo spacecraft .",
    "the data we consider were obtained by the magnetometers ( mag ) onboard vex orbiting venus , _ advanced composition explorer _ ( ace ) orbiting earth , and from the in - situ measurements of particles and cme transients ( impact ) and the plasma and suprathermal ion composition ( plastic ) telescopes onboard stereo . from a series of 3d reconstructions with time , we are able to follow the cme morphological evolution . the height , speed evolution from the sun to venus are also discussed .",
    "the orientation of the filament in the source region , the orientation of the cme major principle axes and the flux rope axis direction derived from vex / mag data are compared .",
    "the cme we have investigated was observed on august 7 , 2010 from three perspectives by the white light coronagraphs large angle spectroscopic coronagraph ( lasco ; @xcite ) c2 and c3 onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ; @xcite ) , cor1 and cor2 in the the sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ; @xcite ) instrument suite onboard stereo .",

    "cor1 reaches a lower altitude with its fov from 1.4 to 4  r@xmath0 , cor2 from 2.5 to 15  r@xmath0 . on august 7 , two stereo spacecraft were separated by around 150 degrees .",
    "the spatial positions of stereo a and b , the planets and their orbits in the inner solar system are presented in figure  [ fig : hee_posi ] in the heliocentric earth ecliptic ( hee ) coordinate system .",
    "venus was located between stereo b and the earth .",
    "the magnetometer onboard vex @xcite will be utilised to verify the cme propagation direction and to determine the cme arrival time at venus .    in figure",
    "[ fig : corab_lasco ] we present the time series of coronagraph images of the cme event for the three viewpoints employed .",
    "all images were processed by standard solarsoft routines secchi_prep and lasco_prep .",
    "cor1 and cor2 images from stereo a are shown in the first row , cor images from stereo b are in the second row , and the c2 and c3 images from lasco are presented in the last row . in each panel",
    ", the operated instrument and observational time are marked at the bottom .",
    "the occulter of coronagraph is indicated as a black mask . as a size reference",
    ", we also plot the solar limb as a white circle onto each panel .",
    "two different background subtraction methods have been applied here to make the cme leading edge and its related shock more prominent . for cor data ,",
    "the respective pre - cme images were subtracted . for lasco - c2 ,",
    "a 12-hour minimum image was created by taking the minimum brightness of each pixel during the 12 hours centred around the cme s first appearance .",
    "the dark area inside the cme in cor1 and cor2 indicates the position of a preexisting helmet streamer which stayed more or less quasi - stationary during the cme evolution .",
    "the first appearance of the cme in cor1 a was at 18:15 , in cor1 b at 18:25 ut , and in c2 at 18:36 ut .    for this particular cme",
    ", we identified shock signatures in the white - light observations .",
    "they appeared as a smooth front which outlined the cme out - most envelope and was associated , spatially and temporally , with streamer deflections @xcite .",
    "they are marked in column 5 in figure  [ fig : corab_lasco ] with two deflected streamers accompanied closely . at lower altitudes as in column 2 , the shock looked like a diffusive area enclosing the cme cloud @xcite .",
    "it is best seen in the c2 image of column 2 where the cme periphery is indicated by plus signs .",
    "the presence of a shock for this cme event is confirmed by the type ii radio burst at a height of about 1.36  r@xmath0 ( n. gopalswamy 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "the shock signature can presumably be linked to the coronal eit waves down to the fov of euvi @xcite onboard stereo  and aia @xcite onboard sdo ( _ solar dynamics observatory _ ) , which are 1.7 and 1.3 solar radii , respectively . in panel ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of figure  [ fig : cme_ini ] , we present the dimming and the wave front in the running difference images observed by euvi b , aia , and euvi a. an animation of the high - cadence aia observations is available in the online journal where the coronal wave signature can be seen more prominently . the wave signatures observed above the limb were well connected to the wave signatures observed against the solar disk .",
    "euvi a provided a better view of the wave dome . inside the dome ,",
    "the erupted prominence was visible in panel ( f ) .",
    "the prominence in 30.4 nm is colored in red , while the wave front is colored in light blue .",
    "when the cme entered the cor 1 fov ( panel ( e ) ) , the cme periphery and shock front are delineated by plus signs and asterisk signs , respectively . in the same panel ,",
    "the cme associated streamer belt is also shown .",
    "details of the shock / eit wave analysis is beyond the scope of this paper and will be pursued in a separate paper .",
    "similar wave behavior and related quantative analyses can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the subtraction of the pre - cme image somehow removed part of the internal structure of the cme . to make the internal structures visible , for cor 1 images we applied the 12-hour minimum image as well .",
    "the resulting images are shown in panel ( d ) of figure  [ fig : cme_ini ] . the cme periphery we used for 3d reconstruction is indicated as black asterisk signs . we tried to exclude as well the sheath between the shock front and the cme which manifested as a diffusive region there .",
    "red plus signs represent the outer boundary of the cme cavity and the area inside green signs indicates the core region . for this cme",
    ", we found that its internal structure is a little bit complicated . in the cavity , it seems that a bright line feature appeared .",
    "if we regard the cme flux rope as the cavity and the prominence attached below @xcite , the area inside the red signs is mainly the cme flux rope and possibly some material following it . except the unknown part hidden behind the occulter",
    ", we found that the cme flux rope occupied most of the area surrounded by the black signs , which we used for the 3d reconstructions .    in order to locate the cme source region ,",
    "we have checked euv images at various wavelengths taken by the euvi instrument onboard stereo and by the aia telescope onboard the sdo spacecraft . at the time of the cme launch , a m1.0 class flare occurred in active region ar  11093 located at n12e31 as viewed from earth on august 7 .",
    "according to goes light curves , the flare started around 17:55 and peaked at 18:24 .",
    "magnetograms from hmi ( helioseismic and magnetic imager , @xcite ) were used to determine the orientation of the magnetic polarity inversion line in the cme source region .",
    "in the traditional stereoscopic technique , two corresponding points from an image pair are back projected along the respective line - of - sight to obtain their 3d coordinates @xcite . @xcite",
    "geometrically reconstructed the cme location plane by plane from two viewpoints .",
    "the authors selected two points on the cme boundary in each image and back - projected to the sun totally four points which lie in the same plane .",
    "their back - projections formed a quadrilateral in that specified plane where the cme is ideally localised .",
    "later , @xcite included the geometric localisation method into the polarimetric technique to remove the ambiguity inherent in this technique .",
    "the idea of our reconstruction method employs the inverse approach of the traditional stereoscopic technique . in this newly developed method",
    ", we forward project a point in the 3d space onto each coronagraph image .",
    "if the three projections are all located inside the respective cme periphery observed in each image , this 3d point is considered as a point inside a 3d volume which must contain the 3d cme cloud entirely . on the other hand , for the cme surface to be consistent with the observed peripheries , it must be close enough to the boundary of the reconstructed 3d volume so that their projections onto the coronagraph images coincide .    in a first step",
    ", we identify the cme periphery in each coronagraph image . at the moment",
    ", it is done by tie - pointing the cme leading edge in each image .",
    "the tie - points are then interpolated by a parametric cubic spline to obtain a smooth periphery curve .",
    "examples of periphery tie - points are shown in column 2 and 6 of figure  [ fig : corab_lasco ] . since we do not know how the cme continues behind the occulter",
    ", we simply extrapolate the ends of the periphery curve from the occulter edge radially to the sun s surface .",
    "the result of this step is saved as binary masks @xmath1 for each image @xmath2 taken by stereo a , lasco and stereo b , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath3 to unity at image pixels @xmath4 inside the periphery curve and to zero outside .",
    "note that the lasco images were not always recorded exactly simultaneously to those from stereo . in these cases ,",
    "the cme periphery curves from two neighbouring frames in time from lasco were interpolated to the time of the stereo observations .    as the next step",
    ", we select a regular 3d mesh of the space around the sun . in our method , the distance of grid points is chosen adaptively depending on the projected cme size in the images . since we are considering a time evolution problem ,",
    "all calculations in this work are performed in a cartesian carrington coordinate system . for each 3d grid point",
    "@xmath5 $ ] we obtain its projection @xmath6 onto image @xmath7 by @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the the matrix of the coordinate transform @xmath10 % a^t_i must be a 2x3 matrix because r_p is 2d , therefore the % last column has to vanish a_i= \\left [ { \\begin{array}{ccc }   -\\sin l_i & -\\cos l_i\\sin b_i \\\\    \\cos l_i & -\\sin",

    ", we set a 3d mask @xmath14 according to @xmath15 this process is repeated for all 3d points until the 3d mask @xmath14 is completely determined .",
    "this mask then defines the embedding 3d volume containing the cme cloud .    as an example of the reconstructed 3d mask we show a horizontal cut of @xmath14 which yields the polygon in figure  [ fig : bezier ] .",
    "the mask area is marked by plus signs at the respective grid points .",
    "the region defined by mask @xmath14 may include areas which do not belong to the true cme area but are yet covered but the projections of the 2d image masks . assuming the real cme surface is smooth , these areas are probably confined to the vicinity of the vertices of the polygon from @xmath14 .",
    "these vertices occur naturally where the boundaries of the back projected 2d masks intersect . from three images",
    "there are up to six vertices possible in every horizontal plane intersecting @xmath14 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bezier ] , these vertices are marked as diamonds .    in a final step ,",
    "we smooth the corners of @xmath14 . for each horizontal plane",
    ", we find the centres on the faces of the 3d mask between each neighbouring pair of vertices .",
    "in figure  [ fig : bezier ] , these centres are marked as stars .",
    "for each vertex we then define a quadratic bzier spline @xmath16 \\label{equ : bezier}\\ ] ] from the three control nodes @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the central @xmath18 is the vertex position and @xmath20 are located at the face centres to either side to the vertex .",
    "this choice of the spline curve insures that the boundary formed by the combination of all spline curves is continuous and smooth as demonstrated by the example in figure  [ fig : bezier ] .",
    "this new boundary is finally adapted as the approximation to the cme shape in each horizontal plane .",
    "similar techniques were used in earlier papers .",
    "@xcite fitted an ellipse to a quadrilateral which was derived from two viewpoints .",
    "however , our bzier curve fitting has more flexibility and is readily adapted to include more than two view directions .",
    "additional view directions provide more constraints to the 3d cme localisation",
    ". however , we have to admit that as the control nodes on the face centres are selected somewhat arbitrarily , there is still some uncertainty about the real cme shape . from our procedure",
    "we obtain the surface with the least curvature compatible with the observations .",
    "this fitting process described above is performed for each horizontal plane . in the end , a smoothed surface of the cme cloud is obtained .",
    "one example of such reconstruction is shown in figure  [ fig : prin_axis_eg ] and is represented by red curves .",
    "we have to mention that since the cme structure below the occulter is unknown , the cme cloud in the region inside the occulter radius from the sun s centre is not plotted .",
    "since a determination of the density distribution in the cme cloud is a highly ill - posed problem and can not be done reliably from only three view directions without further constraints , we take the cme shape as the basis for a further analysis .",
    "we therefore neglect the internal structure of the cme in the analysis below and only characterize the shape of the cloud and its morphological evolution .",
    "hence the centre of the cloud may not be its centre of gravity , but the geometric centre which is still a significant quantity to characterise the position and motion of the cme cloud .",
    "natural characteristics of an amorphous volume are its geometric centre ( gc ) , its three principle axes and their eigenvalues . the geometric centre @xmath21 of the cme cloud can be obtained from @xmath22 where @xmath23 is unity inside the cme cloud and zero elsewhere .",
    "the principle axes and their eigenvalues are found from a diagonalisation of matrix @xmath24 these integrations are straight forwardly performed on the 3d grid chosen to generate the mask @xmath14 .",
    "grid cells intersected by the boundary of @xmath23 are weighted according to their overlap with @xmath23 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : prin_axis_eg ] , we plot the directions of three eigenvectors calculated from the matrix diagonalisation for the cme cloud at 21:24 .",
    "the thickness of three principle axes is proportional to the magnitude of eigenvalues .",
    "all three eigenvectors are centred at cme s geometric centre .",
    "we name minor , intermediate and major axis , respectively , according to the order of their eigenvalues .",
    "based on the reconstructed 3d surface of the cme cloud , further analyses can be made .",
    "a straight forward application is to identify the longitude and latitude of the cme cloud and its spatial extension in 3d .",
    "this information can assist to interpret in - situ measurements . from a time series of the 3d cloud ,",
    "the cme s morphological evolution and propagation properties can be derived .      from the space weather point of view , the longitude and latitude position , the angular width of the cme cloud are very crucial to determine whether or not a cme can interact with a planet s magnetosphere or a spacecraft .",
    "figure  [ fig : topview ] provides a view from a vantage point above the solar north pole in which the localisation of cme relative to the sun , venus and two stereo spacecraft are indicated .",
    "the cme initiated on august 7 was propagating closely towards venus . in figure",
    "[ fig : vex ] we present the magnetic field measurement by the magnetometer onboard venus express ( vex / mag ) from august 9 to 12 . from top to bottom , we plot the total magnetic strength and three magnetic field components in the radial - tangential - normal ( rtn ) coordinate frame . here , vector @xmath25 is the unit vector from sun to the spacecraft , @xmath26 is the unit vector in the direction of the cross product of @xmath25 and solar rotational axis , and @xmath27 completes the right - handed triad .",
    "vex has an elliptical polar orbit with a 24-hour period , and stays in the venusian magnetosheath and magnetosphere from 07:00 to 10:20 ut for each orbit .",
    "mag continuously operates , but we block the data from 07:00 to 10:20 ut to focus on the solar wind structure .    on august 10 , from about 04:00 ut mag detected a sudden discontinuous increase in the magnetic field strength and the abrupt changes in the field direction .",
    "it is likely the shock and sheath signature preceding an icme .",
    "further verification requires also a sudden increase in flow speed , density and thermal speed .",
    "unfortunately , plasma measurements by vex was not available for the solar wind structure .",
    "the spacecraft enters the venusian ionosphere when plasma measurements are made . from 11:00 ut on the same day ,",
    "the magnetic field strength was enhanced and smooth rotations of the field were found . it implies the appearance of a magnetic cloud . due to the lack of plasma measurements ,",
    "a further proof of the lower proton temperature is not available in figure  [ fig : topview ] .    the magnetic field and plasma measurements in figure  [ fig : insitub ] taken from the impact and plastic particle spectrometers onboard stereo b only show the signature of a shock which appeared around 10:00 ut on august 11 . from top to bottom , we plot the magnetic field in rtn coordinates and its total strength , the proton density , the bulk speed and the proton temperature .",
    "we did not see any clear icme at stereo b following the shock .",
    "this observation can be explained by checking the cme localisation relative to the line connecting the sun and stereo b in figure  [ fig : topview ] .",
    "the flank of the reconstructed cme cloud just touches this connection line which is an evidence that the cloud did not pass stereo b. however , since the shock has a larger spatial extension than the cloud , it was still observed at the spacecraft . the projected shape of the cme on the solar equatorial plane indicated that the cme was mainly directed to vex and stereo b. unfortunately , we do not have direct observations of the shock on the equatorial plane , we speculate that the in - situ shock signature might be more prominent in the vex and stereo b observations .",
    "we did not see any signature of an icme and/or a shock in the ace data observed at l1 point .      by following the variation of the calculated eigenvalues and eigenvectors",
    ", we can deduce the cme s morphological evolution . in table  [ tab : eigen ] , the ratio of eigenvalues of the major to the minor axis , and of the intermediate to the minor axis are listed .",
    "the related uncertainties are propagated from the 2d cme tracing uncertainties . in the first column ,",
    "the average distance between the traced cme peripheries and its standard deviation are presented . here",
    "the 2d uncertainty is derived by repeating the tracing process for ten times .",
    "it can be seen that the major morphological differences occurred during the first three time instances .",
    "after 20:08 ut , the shape appears to have remained stable .",
    "this trend can also been seen from the orientation of principle axes in figure  [ fig : prin_evol ] .",
    "we have to admit that our reconstruction is subject to another uncertainty . from the coronagraph observations we can only observe the part of cme outside of the occulter .",
    "this produces a larger uncertainty on the reconstructed cme shape in the early phase of propagation when an unnegligible part of cme was still below the occulter .",
    "therefore , the orientation of the reconstructed cme cloud at the earliest time in figure  [ fig : prin_evol ] might have relatively big error bars .    in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : prin_evol ] , the intermediate principle axis at four different time instances is shown from viewpoint of stereo a. the black sphere represents the sun , the red sphere represents stereo a. the green dots are the geometric centre at different times .",
    "and the green line is the linear interpolation of these green dots indicating the cme propagation direction .",
    "the projected cme cloud at 18:48 ut and 21:24 ut is presented as well in red and blue in panel ( a ) , respectively .",
    "we find that the orientation along which the cme is most extended as seen in cor a is more or less consistent with the intermediate axis , not with the major axis .",
    "it implies that for this cme , the most elongated direction in 3d is not lying in the projected cor a image plane .",
    "the evolution of the intermediate axis shows big changes in orientation from 18:48 ut to 20:39 ut .",
    "this shape change is also evident in cor a observations . in the early phase of the propagation",
    ", the northern part was moving ahead of the southern part .",
    "the reason is that the northern part of the filament related to this cme erupted first @xcite .",
    "later on , the southern part of the cme entered the fast solar wind region and was probably accelerated .",
    "the interaction of the cme with the fast and slow solar wind components likely produced a heart - like shape .",
    "the slow solar wind appears to originate from a region that is known as the streamer belt , which was around the solar equatorial plane as can be seen in panel ( e ) of figure  [ fig : cme_ini ] . because the cme had a speed ( see  4.4 ) greater than the slow solar wind , say typically about 400 km  @xmath28 , it became significantly decelerated near the streamer belt ; whereas the part of cme in higher latitudes might even be accelerated , if the ambient fast solar wind had a higher speed .",
    "varying conditions at different latitudes likely caused the distortion of the cme structure .",
    "it can also be seen in panel ( a ) that the propagation of the cme geometric centre points more or less to the dip of the concave inward bulge of the cme shape which marks the position of the streamer belt .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the major axis projected onto the solar equatorial plane . the thin orange solid line is the direction perpendicular to the cme propagation .",
    "we find that the orientation of the major axis does not show much variation during the cme evolution .",
    "interestingly , it is not perpendicular to the propagation direction .",
    "the asymmetry with respect to the propagation direction probably reflects a west - east asymmetry of the filament eruption .",
    "panel ( c ) presents the evolution of the major axis as seen along the propagation direction .",
    "again we find an almost constant orientation during the later phase of the cme evolution .",
    "our analysis indicates a rotation of the major axis in the early stage from 18:48 ut to 19:54 ut .",
    "however , this rotation might also be due to the uncertainty of the cme shape at 18:48 ut introduced by the part of the cme still hidden behind the occulter .",
    "a comparison of the orientation of the cme with the related filament and in - situ icme will be discussed in  4.3 .",
    "the last panel in figure  [ fig : prin_evol ] shows the intermediate and the major axes together with the projected cme cloud as seen from the perspective perpendicular to the cme propagation at 18:48 ut and 21:24 ut .",
    "the major axis at 19:54 ut and 20:39 ut from this perspective are plotted as well .",
    "it is clear that the shape has changed significantly from 18:48 ut to 21:24 ut .",
    "again , the most obvious change is during the early phase of the evolution .      extrapolating of the cme geometric centre propagation direction backwards to the solar surface , we arrive at a location very close to ar 11093 .",
    "considering the error bar of the 3d reconstructions especially at the early phase of the propagation , the active region may be regarded as the possible source region .",
    "the extrapolation of the geometric centre is quite helpful for the identification of a cme s source region , especially around the solar activity maximum when there are multiple active regions and more frequent activities .",
    "reddy et al . ( 2011 ) and srivastava et al . ( 2011 ) made detailed analyses of ar 11093 .",
    "they found that it was the rising of a filament that led to a m 1.0 class flare and the cme on august 7 , 2010 . here",
    "we present some complementary investigations of the source region . in figure",
    "[ fig : sourcer ] are aia and hmi observations .",
    "the upper panel shows the euv image at 304    right before the flare with hmi magnetogram contours overplotted .",
    "the lower panel shows the post - flare arcades observed at 171    by aia well after the cme release .",
    "from goes observations we find that the flare started around 17:55 ut and peaked at 18:24 ut .",
    "the filament marked 1 in figure  [ fig : sourcer ] , upper panel , rose before the flare which is also indicated by the deviation of this filament to the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) .",
    "as filament 1 is relatively high , the projected filament is , due to the projection effect , not lying along the pil .",
    "however , filament 2 seems to be consistent with the pil .",
    "its disappearance is probably related to the heating by the flare .",
    "the orientation of the pil in the active region approximated by filament 2 can be compared with the orientation of the major principle axis calculated from the 3d cme cloud and the flux rope orientation deduced from the vex / mag data .",
    "we note that the orientation derived from the vex data only involves the flux rope component in a cme , while the major axis of the reconstructed 3d cme is related to the leading edge , flux rope and possibly some material following it . in section 2",
    "we found that the cme flux rope in the coronagraph image occupied most of the area which we used for the 3d reconstructions , the major axis is used as a first approximation of the orientation of the 3d cme flux rope .",
    "the filament is curved as seen from figure  [ fig : sourcer ] , we can only make a rough comparison .",
    "the general orientation of the filament lies in the direction from northeast to southwest which is consistent with the major axis indicated in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : prin_evol ] .",
    "the orientation of the flux rope observed by vex was computed by the minimal variance analysis ( mva ) method .",
    "it has a direction of ( 0.96 , 0.01 , -0.29 ) in rtn coordinate system which means that the detected flux rope is mainly in the radial direction . compared with the flux rope orientation in the remote - sensing data , there is a big difference . from the top view of the reconstructed 3d cme in figure  [ fig : topview ]",
    ", it seems realistic that only the leg of the flux rope structure passed through vex . in consequence ,",
    "the orientation measured by mag indicates a nearly radial direction .",
    "if a spacecraft traveled through different parts of the magnetic cloud , the flux rope orientation seen by the spacecraft may vary significantly . a diagram depicting the possible vex spacecraft path in the magnetic flux rope",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : mc_ske ] . however ,",
    "if the spacecraft went through the flux rope along the green path , we might arrive at a flux rope axis almost perpendicular to the green direction .      in figure",
    "[ fig : lonlat_evo ] , the trajectory of the cme geometric centre is plotted .",
    "the figure shows its distance from the sun and its longitude and latitude .",
    "near the sun , the geometric centre has an average speed near around 512 @xmath29 .",
    "the averaged longitude and latitude in the carrington coordinates are -12.8 and -6.18 degrees , respectively .",
    "the cme was propagating roughly in the radial direction .",
    "however , the latitude decreases from the source region at around 12 degrees in the northern hemisphere to -9 degrees in the southern hemisphere at a distance of about 10 solar radii .",
    "similar deflections of a cme have been reported by @xcite and other authors .",
    "cmes which are launched inside the solar activity belts at a time before the solar maximum and which possess a total plasma and magnetic pressure less than the ambient solar wind , are often deflected to the latitude where the slow solar wind resides .",
    "after deriving the 3d localisation of the cme cloud , we also localise the part of the cme leading edge around the solar equatorial plane directed to venus . in figure",
    "[ fig : ht_vt ] , the corresponding height - time ( ht ) plot is presented in the left panel .",
    "the last point in the ht diagram is derived from vex data .",
    "it corresponds to the arrival of the icme at venus at around 11:00 ut on august 10 .",
    "the @xmath30 axis is in units of hours starting from the beginning of august . on the right side of figure",
    "[ fig : ht_vt ] , the speed is calculated from the ht plot with an exponential fit .",
    "the fit is constrained by ht data on the left .",
    "the vex data point was included such that the respective travel time of the speed agrees with the distance to venus .",
    "we conclude from the low asymptotic speed of about 430  @xmath29 that the cme was embedded in the slow solar wind which severely decelerated the cme .",
    "we have developed a new method to obtain the 3d shape of a cme cloud without assuming a predefined family of shape functions .",
    "we applied our method to a cme which erupted on august 7 , 2010 .",
    "the geometric centre , three principle axes and the corresponding scale along them were derived and their evolution with time is presented .",
    "we could observe the evolution of the cme shape for approximately 3 hours .",
    "we find that a significant deformation occurred during the first two hours . during the last hour of observation , the shape evolution was more limited and continued almost self - similarly .",
    "we attribute the change of the cme morphology during the first two hours to its interaction with the ambient solar wind .",
    "the projected cme major axes are found not perpendicular to the propagation direction .",
    "it is probably due to the east - west asymmetry of the cme related filament eruption .",
    "the determination of the cme shape is helpful to interpret the in situ observations by vex / mag , stereo a & b / impact , stereo a & b / plastic and ace .",
    "vex detected a magnetic cloud following the preceding shock , stereo b only saw the shock .",
    "this is supported by our reconstruction which , if extrapolated out to 1 au , predicts that the cme just missed the location of stereo b. for ace , the shock had probably dissolved into the background solar wind before it arrived at the earth .",
    "therefore , ace did not detect any shock signature .    by extrapolating the cme geometric centre propagation direction backwards to the solar surface , we find that the source region of this cme is likely the active region ar 11093 located at n12e31 in which a m1.0 class flare occurred about 40 min before the cme became visible in the stereo coronagraphs .",
    "the rise of the destabilised filament led to cme eruption .",
    "the orientation of the polarity inversion line in ar 11093 is in general consistent with the major principle axes of the cme shape we have obtained from its reconstructed shape .",
    "however , it is not consistent with the flux rope axis deduced from the vex data with the mva method .",
    "according to the reconstructed cme localisation in the equatorial plane , it is very probable that only the leg of the cme flux rope passed the vex spacecraft .",
    "indeed , the flux rope observed showed a strong inclination in the radial direction .",
    "a comparison of the latitude of the source region with the latitude of geometric centre of the reconstructed 3d cme implies there is a southward component of its motion .",
    "if the plasma pressure and magnetic pressure in the cme is less than that of the background solar wind , the cme is often deflected away from the coronal hole where the fast solar wind dominates .    combining the remote - sensing measurement and the in situ data from vex",
    ", we derive the 3d distance and speed evolution of the cme motion from sun to venus .",
    "the cme speed decreases from 900 @xmath29 at one hour after its initiation to 430 @xmath29 .",
    "probably the cme speed was finally adjusted to the ambient solar wind flow .",
    "@xcite investigated at which heliospheric distance the drag force starts to prevail over the driving magnetic force so that the speed of the icme gets finally adjusted to the speed of the ambient solar wind .",
    "they analysed the observations of different cmes and found that this heliospheric distance varies considerably from below 30 @xmath31 to beyond 1 au",
    ". theoretical and observational work on the driving and drag forces during the cme evolution and propagation from the sun to the interplanetary medium can also be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for the cme we have analysed",
    ", we estimate that this distance at which the cme speed becomes adjusted to the solar wind speed is beyond the fov of cor2 .",
    "therefore , to derive a reliable speed profile , eventually to make an accurate prediction of the cme transit time on earth or other planets , at least heliospheric imager i ( hi 1 ) in the secchi instrument package has to be included for the investigated cme . in the near future , we will extend the mask fitting method to hi observations .",
    "a precise prediction of the cme travel time also depends on the accuracy of the reconstruction method .",
    "comparison of our mask fitting method and other 3d reconstruction methods , for example , gcs forward modeling , polarisation ratio , local correlation track combined with tie - pointing , geometrical localization , etc .",
    ", will be presented in another paper .",
    "for this particular cme associated with a complicated polarity inversion line , the forward modeling of the cme by a single flux rope model will probably be not very successful owing to the odd shape of the cme .",
    "a fit with two flux ropes might give better results .",
    "a shortcoming of our mask fitting method is that the internal structure of the cme is not included .",
    "we are planning to extend our shape reconstruction method by a tomographic approach to determine a constrained density distribution model within the 3d cme cloud .",
