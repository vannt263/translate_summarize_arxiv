    "r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are rare , hydrogen - deficient , carbon rich supergiants ( clayton 1996 ) . at irregular intervals",
    ", they exhibit dramatic declines of 2 to 8 magnitudes .",
    "these declines are caused by dust formation along the line of sight .",
    "the rarity of rcb stars may stem from the fact that they are in an extremely rapid phase of the evolution toward white dwarfs .",
    "therefore , understanding rcb stars is a key test for any theory attempting to explain hydrogen deficiency in post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "only about 35 rcb stars are known in the galaxy . because of their rarity , the identification of new rcb stars is important to the study of this exotic class of star .",
    "rcb stars are true irregular variables ( clayton , whitney , & mattei 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "they spend a majority of their time at maximum light with a characteristic time between declines of about 1100 days ( feast 1986 ) .",
    "however , there is a wide variation in decline activity from star to star ( jurcsik 1996 ) .",
    "also , individual stars often vary from extremely active to extremely inactive on the timescale of decades ( e.g. , mattei , waagen , & foster 1991,1993 ) .    on the basis of a more complete census of rcb stars in the lmc than is possible in the galaxy , alcock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that many rcb stars lie undiscovered in the galaxy .",
    "they also suggest that cool ( t@xmath0 5000 k ) rcb stars are far more numerous but intrinsically fainter than the warm ( t@xmath0 7000 k ) stars .",
    "so these fainter , redder stars may have been selectively missed in previous surveys .",
    "this suggestion has been supported in that rcb stars recently discovered in the galaxy have tended to be cool ( e.g. , clayton et al . 2002 ; benson et al . 1994 ) .    in 2001 , the star cd -22 12017 , not previously known to be a variable , went into a deep rcb star - like decline ( haseda & kato 2001 ) .",
    "this new variable star was temporarily known as hadv98 and is now officially designated as v2552 oph ( kazarovets et al .",
    "this paper presents photometric and spectroscopic data suggesting that v2552 oph is indeed a member of the rcb class of variable stars .",
    "v2552 oph is listed in the hubble space telescope guide star catalog ( gsc 2.2 s223121279620 ) with coordinates , @xmath1(2000.0 ) = 17@xmath2 23@xmath3 14556 , @xmath4(2000.0 ) = -22  52  0623 .",
    "we obtained a low resolution spectrum of v2552 oph on 2002 june 10 using the steward observatory 90-inch  telescope with its boller & chivens spectrograph , a ccd detector , 45  slit and a 300 line @xmath5 grating .",
    "a spectral range from 4300 to 8200   was recorded at a spectral resolution of about 10  .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure 1 along with a spectrum of the lmc rcb star , w men for comparison ( alcock et al .",
    "the spectra are not photometric so the slope differences should not be given credence .",
    "the spectra of the two stars are very similar .",
    "they are very typical warm ( t@xmath0 7000 k ) rcb star spectra having the following features : weak or absent hydrogen lines and ch bands , strong carbon lines and fairly weak molecular bands ( cn , c@xmath6 ) ( clayton 1996 ) .",
    "these features are marked in figure 1 .",
    "the identification of v2552 oph as an rcb star has been confirmed recently by comparing a high resolution spectrum of v2552 oph to the spectra of other rcb stars ( rao & lambert 2003 ) .",
    "they find that the spectrum is very similar to that of r crb itself , and that the abundances of v2552 oph most closely resemble fh sct and y mus in that sr , y and zr are enhanced .",
    "the recent lightcurve of v2552 oph from 1997 to 2003 is shown in kato & haseda ( 2003 ) .",
    "the star was apparently constant in brightness at v@xmath710.7 mag for almost 4 years from jd 2450654 to 2452022 .",
    "twenty days later , v2552 oph was discovered to be in a deep decline at v @xmath712 mag ( kato & haseda 2003 ) .",
    "before 1997 , the brightness of v2552 oph was not monitored regularly .",
    "it was observed by hipparcos in 1991 .",
    "the tycho-2 catalogue gives v=10.9 @xmath8 0.2 mag and b - v = 1.0 @xmath8 0.2 mag .",
    "these magnitudes have been converted to the johnson system ( esa 1997 ) and are consistent with the maximum light brightness of v2552 oph given by kato & haseda ( 2003 ) .",
    "rao & lambert ( 2003 ) estimate the reddening toward v2552 oph to be e(b - v)@xmath70.4 mag based on the strength of a diffuse interstellar band .",
    "the measured b - v of v2552 oph is @xmath71.0 mag .",
    "therefore , its intrinsic b - v would be 0.6 mag in good agreement with the intrinsic colors of other warm rcb stars such as r crb and ry sgr .",
    "v2552 oph appears in the first volume of the cordoba durchmusterung ( cd ) catalog with a visual brightness of 9.7 mag ( thome 1892 ) .",
    "the transformation from @xmath9 to @xmath10 has been determined to be , @xmath11 = 0.21@xmath12(@xmath13 ) ( stanton 1999 ) .",
    "so for v2552 oph , the cd catalog implies that v2552 oph had a brightness of v@xmath79.5 mag sometime before 1892 .",
    "the star does not appear in any other stellar catalog including the hd , cp and sao catalogs .",
    "the fact that v2552 oph does not appear in these catalogs makes it likely that its magnitude and color were more similar to their present day values than the uncertain v@xmath79.5 mag quoted in the cd catalog .",
    "v2552 oph was not noticed to be variable at any time before 2001 .",
    "the harvard college observatory ( hco ) photographic plate collection was searched for fields containing v2552 oph .",
    "the majority of the hco collection consists of blue plates taken with a variety of refractors having focal scales of 60 - 600 @xmath14 .",
    "eye estimates of the photographic magnitude ( m@xmath15 ) of v2552 oph were carried out on 80 plates covering 1931 - 1951 and 1970 - 1989 .",
    "the temporal coverage of the hco plates is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the brightness of v2552 oph was visually compared to that of two neighboring stars of similar magnitude , gsc2.2",
    "s223121279668 and s223121280800 . no significant brightness variations were found . on all plates studied v2552 oph",
    "was observed to be constant at or near maximum light , at around m@xmath15=12.2 mag .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath16 measurements is of order @xmath80.4  mag .",
    "the transformation from @xmath16 to johnson @xmath10 ( @xmath17 = 0.17 - 1.09@xmath12(@xmath13 ) ) is @xmath17 = -0.9 mag ( arp 1961 ; pierce & jacoby 1995 ) .",
    "so the brightness of v2552 oph on the hco plates obtained between 1931 and 1989 is v@xmath711.3 mag , which is consistent with its maximum light brightness at the present epoch .",
    "v2552 oph is also present on various survey plates ( e.g. , usno , gsc , serc ) obtained on the following dates : 1950.529 , 1980.485 , 1986.940 , 1987.579 , 1987.634 , 1987.650 , 1992.555 , 1992.57 , 1997.244 , and 1999.490 . on all of these plates",
    ", v2552 oph appears to be at maximum light .",
    "the lightcurve of v2552 oph , while fragmentary , shows no sign of a decline in the 70 years before 2001 .",
    "it is certainly possible for a small decline of a few tenths of a magnitude to have been missed . but a significant decline of several magnitudes will typically last a year or more .",
    "a good example is the decline that v2552 oph experienced in 2001 - 2002 ( kato & haseda 2003 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that such a decline was missed during the years for which at least one hco plate was measured .",
    "v2552 oph has been observed twice in the near - ir by 2mass and denis . in 1999",
    "( 2451305.8021 ) , 2mass found v2552 oph to be , j=8.69@xmath80.02 mag , h=8.39@xmath80.04 mag , and k=8.16@xmath80.02 mag ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) . in 2000",
    "( 2451827.983647 ) denis found j=8.68@xmath80.06 mag and k=8.14@xmath80.06 mag .",
    "the data agree well within the errors .",
    "v2552 oph , when corrected for reddening , lies very close to y mus in the ( h - k)@xmath18 vs ( j - k)@xmath18 plot ( feast 1997 ) .",
    "both stars lie in the region of the diagram populated by the hydrogen - deficent carbon stars which make little or no dust . in over a hundred years , y",
    "mus has been observed to decline only twice , in 1897 and 1953 ( feast 1997 ) .",
    "most rcb stars show an near - ir excess even if they have not had a decline for several years , indicating that dust is still being formed near the star just not along the line of sight to the star ( feast 1997 ) . however , for y mus and v2552 oph , the data indicate that recent dust formation has been small or non - existent . in the 2mass and denis photometry ,",
    "v2552 oph exhibited no excess emission because the data were obtained in 1999 - 2000 just before the start of dust production resulted in the decline in 2001 .",
    "this indicates that like y mus , v2552 oph had not been making dust recently .",
    "v2552 oph is not in the iras point source catalog or faint source catalog ( fsc ) .",
    "however , it does appear in the fsc rejects list which includes objects with s / n greater than 3 that do not meet other criteria for inclusion in the fsc .",
    "v2552 oph had measured fluxes of 0.27@xmath80.08 jy , 0.26@xmath80.06 jy , 1.46@xmath80.34 jy , and 11.48@xmath82.64 jy in the 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  bands , respectively . in particular , the iras fluxes for v2552 oph increase to higher wavelengths .",
    "all of the rcb stars observed with iras show the opposite behavior .",
    "they are brightest at 12  ( walker 1985 ) .",
    "in particular , y mus , shows a 12  flux of 1.02@xmath80.09 jy .",
    "the estimated distances of y mus and v2552 oph are very similar assuming they both have m@xmath19= -5 mag ( alcock et al .",
    "y mus is at 7.2 kpc and v2552 oph is at 7.9 kpc assuming interstellar dust extinction with r@xmath19=3.1 ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ; lawson et al .",
    "if both stars had identical dust clouds surrounding them , then y mus would appear about 20% brighter .",
    "but even if the suspect v2552 oph iras flux is correct , y mus is about 4 times as bright at 12  indicating more dust is present around that star . so v2552 oph may have been inactive for a longer period of time than y mus .",
    "spectroscopically , v2552 oph is a typical warm rcb star .",
    "but it is one of the most inactive of the rcb stars over the last 70 years putting it in a class with y mus .",
    "now that v2552 oph may have entered an active phase , it will be interesting to monitor its new dust affects the near- and far - ir emission from the star especially now that sirtf has been launched .",
