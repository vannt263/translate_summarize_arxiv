    "we are concerned with quantum compression , which is best understood in the context of quantum information theory .",
    "informally , the schumacher coding theorem @xcite states that a qubit source can be compressed to its von neumann entropy with high fidelity .",
    "this statement is strongly analogous to the shannon coding theorem for classical information theory which states that a bit source can be compressed to its shannon entropy with high probability .",
    "quantum compression is therefore concerned with algorithms for achieving compression near to the von neumann entropy of a qubit source in a reasonable amount of time and space .",
    "the main result of this paper is a compilation algorithm which takes as input any family of classical block compression ( and decompression ) algorithm as well as a description of the quantum source .",
    "the output is a quantum block compression and decompresion algorithm with the following properties :    1 .   if the classical compression algorithm asymptotically approaches shannon entropy , then the quantum compression algorithm asymptotically approaches the von neumann entropy .",
    "2 .   if the classical compression and decompresion algorithm each take space @xmath0 and time @xmath1 , then the quantum compression algorithm uses space @xmath2 and time @xmath3 ( for any @xmath4 ) .",
    "several hand constructed algorithms for block quantum data compression have been proposed .",
    "these include quantum arithmetic compression @xcite which runs in @xmath5 time and a combinatoric index compression algorithm @xcite running in @xmath5 time and @xmath6 space . in further work ,",
    "the combinatoric index compression was parallelized to a circuit of only polylogarithmic depth @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper will discuss some information theory preliminaries , present the compiler , compare the performance of this compiler with hand crafted approaches , and then close with discussion .",
    "suppose that we have a qubit source producing qubits in the state @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 .",
    "then the density matrix of this source will be given by the average outer product : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the eigenvectors of the density matrix and @xmath11 is the eigenvalue of @xmath10 .",
    "we wish to compress the tensor product of @xmath12 qubits each drawn independently from this source so as to achieve a high `` fidelity '' .",
    "fidelity is defined as the probability that a measurement can distinguish between the input and output states .",
    "let @xmath13 be the input state chosen with random bits @xmath14 , and @xmath15 be the output of a compression / decompression cycle .",
    "then , the fidelity is defined by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an expectation with respect to the quantum source as well as with respect to the outcome of the quantum measurement .",
    "the schumacher coding theorem states that the minimum coding rate of any compression scheme with a high expected fidelity is given by the von neumann entropy : @xmath18 thus , we are particularly motivated by compression schemes which can ( asymptotically ) achieve the von neumann entropy .",
    "a generic ( classical ) block compression algorithm , @xmath19 , maps @xmath12 bits to @xmath20 bits with @xmath12 larger than @xmath20 . the corresponding decompression algorithm , @xmath21 ,",
    "will then ( hopefully ) invert the compression to give the original state .",
    "we can use the general result that any classical function can be implemented @xcite ( reasonably efficiently ) on a quantum computer .",
    "in particular , if we let @xmath22 be the bits of the input string and @xmath23 be the bits of the compressed string then we can compile the compression circuit into the reversible circuit which calculates : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are auxiliary bits .",
    "the same trick can be done with the decompression circuit to get : @xmath26 pictorially , our circuits are the following :    these elements will be our two fundamental building blocks in the construction of generic quantum block compression .",
    "two challenges exist :    1 .   @xmath27 and @xmath28 both have outputs which are entangled with their input .",
    "this is unacceptable in any quantum compression scheme .",
    "2 .   there are some quantum sources with a low von neumann entropy but a large shannon entropy .",
    "we will need to make a circuit which achieves compression near the shannon entropy to achieve compression near the von neumann entropy .",
    "these two challenges are met in the next subsections .",
    "we are not finished with the compression because the output of @xmath27 leaves the compressed bits entangled with the input bits .",
    "there is a simple construction which removes this entanglement : compose the decompressor with the compressor to get the following circuit :    here we have set the auxiliary bits to @xmath29 .",
    "the output of the first compression block is the compressed bits along with the uncompressed bits .",
    "the uncompressed bits are then fed into the decompression block instead of @xmath29 s , resulting in an output consisting of the compressed bits plus things of the form @xmath30 .",
    "this term is @xmath29 precisely when the compression is lossless . by assumption ,",
    "the compression is lossless with high probability implying that we will essentially always measure the @xmath29 vector .",
    "at this point , we can measure all of the `` @xmath29 '' qubits . if any of our measurements are nonzero , we have detected a low probability event .",
    "the process of this measurement will project the wavefunction onto the typical subspace , letting us achieve the projection done explicitly in @xcite for `` free '' as a byproduct of our compression process .",
    "this construction is also particularly elegant because decompression ( with entaglement removal ) can be accomplished by simply reading the circuit backwards .    in summary",
    ", we now have a technique for constructing a quantum compression circuit which outputs the compressed string _ without _ extra entanglement .",
    "the above approach only does _ classical _ compression of qubits and so it can only achieve the shannon entropy .",
    "in particular , it will fail to compress some highly compressible quantum state distributions such as the state which is @xmath31 with probability @xmath32 .",
    "this state is highly compressible because it has a trivial distribution over possibilities and yet no classical algorithm will compress the qubits well . in order to accomplish compression of this state , we must add an extra rotation to the input and output of the compression and decompression .",
    "for example , the operation @xmath33 ( hadamard applied to each bit ) , would convert the input to @xmath34 which is highly compressible .",
    "this extra rotation involves @xmath35 operations since it can be done on each symbol from the quantum source individually giving us the following circuit :    the interpretation of this circuit is simple : we first rotate every qubit to align the eigenbasis and the computational basis . then",
    ", we apply the compression circuit using the decompression circuit to remove entanglement with the input values . mathematically",
    ", we compute @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rotation into the eigenbasis .",
    "once again , decompression is done using the circuit backwards .",
    "this solution works for _ any _ quantum source .",
    "given a description of any quantum source , the eigenvalue decomposition theorem says that we can construct a matrix @xmath37 which satisfies : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and @xmath37 is a matrix consisting of eigenvectors . the @xmath37 matrix will rotate the input source so that the computational basis and the eigenbasis coincide .",
    "this rotation does not affect the von neumann entropy of the source .",
    "now , given that the computational basis and eigenbasis coincide , the von neumann entropy will be exactly the same as the shannon entropy .",
    "the compiled circuit will therefore achieve the von neumann limit .",
    "to summarize , the compiler is the following :    _ make_quantum_compression_circuit(@xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) _    1 .   compile the quantum reversible circuits @xmath28 and @xmath27 from the classical circuits @xmath42 and @xmath41",
    "2 .   compose @xmath28 and @xmath27 as in section [ unentangle ] .",
    "3 .   calculate the eigenvalue matrix , @xmath37 , given @xmath40 .",
    "4 .   rotate all input and output qubits of the quantum circuit by @xmath37 as in section [ rotate ] .",
    "how efficiently can we compile compression algorithms made for classical ( irreversible ) computers into reversible quantum mechanical programs ?",
    "there are a very few results here which are well summarized in @xcite .",
    "there are a variety of tradeoffs all of which are typically parameterized by the space @xmath0 and time @xmath1 of the original irreversible algorithm .",
    "one of the more concrete results is that reversible space is @xmath43 and the reversible time is ( for any @xmath4 ) @xmath44 .    applying this result to the common bzip2 block compression algorithm which runs in space @xmath45 and time @xmath46 will require @xmath47 space and @xmath48 time ( for any @xmath4 ) .",
    "if we choose @xmath49 , this is a smaller running time than @xmath5 as used by previous hand crafted quantum block compression algorithms .",
    "it is easy to imagine that hand compilation of irreversible compression / decompression algorithms can yield further functional improvements .",
    "the technique for automatically compiling classical compression algorithms into quantum compression algorithms gives us a baseline and general structure for comparison with hand crafted quantum compression algorithms .",
    "the automatic approach is reasonably efficient and can give results better than current hand crafted approaches in some cases .",
    "hand crafted algorithms which are functionally more efficient than this baseline are a nontrivial improvement .",
    "the technique of section [ unentangle ] applies to _ any _ pair of classical algorithms with an inversion property : @xmath50 .",
    "this includes encryption and decryption or encoding and decoding . for algorithms with this property",
    ", we can construct quantum analogs with a special property : the `` inputs '' are disentangled from the `` outputs '' .",
    "this disentanglement comes at a relatively small price : a factor of @xmath51 increase in the circuit size .",
    "in addition to hand crafting efficient compression algorithms , one other significant problem in quantum data compression exists : removing the requirement for full information about the quantum source .",
    "we know this is ( information theoretically ) possible @xcite although no explicit quantum algorithm yet exists that achieves asymptotically efficient compression without knowledge of the source .",
    "intuitively , this is possible because the precision of the specification of @xmath37 improves exponentially with increasing ( qu)bits while the necessary precision required in specifying @xmath37 scales linearly with @xmath12 , the number of input qubits .",
    "consequently , the portion of the bits which must be allocated to specifying @xmath37 is asymptotically @xmath29 .",
    "an explicit algorithm for doing universal quantum compression would yield a significant improvement in our understanding of quantum compression .",
