    "the study and understanding of the properties of growing interfaces have attracted great interest . in fact , interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and their study has opened a promising field of multidisciplinary research @xcite . interfaces naturally emerge in a wide variety of systems such as film growth by vapour deposition , chemical deposition or molecular beam epitaxy @xcite , propagation of fire fronts @xcite , diffusion fronts @xcite , bacterial growth @xcite , solidification @xcite , propagation of reaction fronts in catalysed reactions @xcite , electrodeposition/ dissolution experiments @xcite , sedimentation @xcite , etc .    models of growing interfaces may be defined and studied either by using discrete lattices or by means of continuous equations .",
    "discrete models are defined by a set of rules that provide a detailed microscopic description of the evolution of the growing aggregate . in these models",
    "the interface is described by a discrete set @xmath18 that represents the height of site @xmath19 at time @xmath20 .",
    "the interface has @xmath21 sites , where @xmath22 is the linear size and @xmath23 is the dimensionality of the substrate .",
    "the interface of the aggregate is characterised through the scaling behaviour of the interface width @xmath24 ^ 2 } $ ] . for this purpose ,",
    "the family - vicsek phenomenological scaling approach @xcite has proved to be very successful for the description of the dynamic evolution of growing interfaces .",
    "in fact , it may be expected that @xmath25 would show the spatio - temporal scaling behaviour given by @xcite : @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the crossover time between these two regimes .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are called roughness , growth and dynamic exponents , respectively .",
    "also , different models can be grouped into universality classes when they share the same scaling exponents .",
    "in contrast to the microscopic details of the growing mechanisms of the interface , continuous equations focus on the macroscopic aspects of the roughness . essentially , the aim is to follow the evolution of the coarse - grained height function @xmath34 by using a well - established phenomenological approach that takes all the relevant processes that survive at a coarse - grained level into account .",
    "this procedure normally leads to stochastic non - linear partial differential equations that , in general , may be written as follows @xcite    @xmath35    where the index @xmath36 symbolically denotes different processes , @xmath37 is a local functional that contains the various surface relaxation phenomena and only depends on the spatial derivatives of @xmath34 since the growth process is assumed to be determined by the local properties of the surface only .",
    "also , @xmath38 denotes the mean deposition rate and @xmath39 is the deposition noise that determines the fluctuations of the incoming flux around its mean value @xmath38 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the noise is spatially and temporally uncorrelated .    in order to establish the correspondence between a continuous growth equation and a discrete model one can apply at least three different methods : ( i ) to numerically simulate the model and compare the obtained scaling exponents with those of the corresponding continuous equation , ( ii ) to develop a set of plausibility arguments using physical principles and ( iii ) to derive the continuous equation analytically starting from a given discrete model .",
    "there are few papers in the direction of the last method .",
    "for example , a systematic approach proposed by vvedensky et al @xcite , where the continuous equations can be constructed directly from the growth rules of some discrete models , based on the master equation description , has been applied successfully@xcite .",
    "this procedure requires a regularisation step , in which non - analytic quantities are expanded and replaced by analytic approaches , e.g. , the step function is approximated by a shifted hyperbolic tangent function expanded in a taylor series . as pointed out by pedota and kotrla @xcite ,",
    "the choice of the regularisation scheme for the step function is ambiguous .",
    "thus , the coefficients entering in the derived continuum stochastic equation can not be determined uniquely .",
    "another method has shown the connection between the ballistic deposition discrete model and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation in @xmath40 dimensions . however , this method is not successful in @xmath41 dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that most of the already mentioned progress in the understanding of the properties of interfaces has been achieved when the growth of the aggregate is due to one kind of particle only .",
    "in contrast , less attention has been drawn to the study of the dynamics of competitive growing processes .",
    "it is well known that these competitive processes are significant to the growth of real materials in at least two different ways : a ) when the growing process involves two or more kinds of particles , and b ) when deposition of a single kind of particle is considered , but such type of particle may undergo different growing mechanisms .",
    "one example of case a ) arises from the deposition of alloys or systems with impurities , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in this case , there may be different interactions between different kinds of particles causing the growing mechanisms to change @xcite . based on these ideas , cerdeira et al @xcite",
    "have studied various models for binary systems involving competitive random - like and ballistic - like deposition .",
    "recently , the scaling behaviour of a two - component surface - growth model has been studied by kotrla et al @xcite .",
    "this study addresses the relationship between kinetic roughening and phase ordering in a @xmath42-dimensional single - step solid - on - solid model with ising - like interactions between two components .    on the other hand ,",
    "considering the deposition of one kind of particle ( case b ) , pellegrini et al @xcite have studied a ballistic model of surface growth that considers `` sticky '' and `` sliding''particles .",
    "the model interpolates between a standard ballistic model when only sticky particles are deposited ( with probability @xmath43 ) and a completely restructured ballistic model for @xmath44 when only unrestricted sliding particles are allowed to become attached to the sample . using this model pellegrini",
    "et al @xcite have given evidence of a roughening transition in dimensions @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while such kind of transition is no longer observed in @xmath47 .    in a related context of competitive growing processes ,",
    "we have also studied two competitive growth models in @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 dimensions @xcite . in the first discrete growth model , namely the rdsr / rd model ,",
    "the same types of particles are aggregated according to the rules of random deposition with surface relaxation ( rdsr ) with probability @xmath1 and according to the rules of random deposition ( rd ) with probability ( @xmath51)@xcite . in the second discrete growth model , namely the bd / rd model",
    ", particles are aggregated according to the rules of ballistic deposition ( bd ) with probability @xmath1 and according to the rules of random deposition ( rd ) with probability ( @xmath51)@xcite .    for both the rdsr / rd and the bd / rd models the saturation process of the interface width depends sensitively on @xmath1 : saturation takes place at longer times for smaller values of @xmath1 , while the final width of the interface is smaller for larger @xmath1-values . furthermore , in both models , three different regimes and two corresponding crossovers can easily be observed . for short times , say @xmath52 , the random growth of the interface is observed ( i.e. the rd process dominates ) . at this stage , correlations have not been developed yet and @xmath53 @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) holds . during an intermediate time regime ,",
    "say @xmath56 , correlations develop since the rdsr ( bd ) process now dominates leading to @xmath53 @xmath57 ( @xmath53 @xmath58 ) . at a later stage , for @xmath59",
    ", correlations can no longer grow due to the geometrical constraint of the lattice size and saturation is observed .",
    "the saturation value of the interface width @xmath60 and the characteristic crossover time @xmath4 behave as @xcite    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath6 are exponents and x @xmath63 rdsr or bd , depending on the model . on the other hand",
    ", one has that the crossover time @xmath64 also scales with @xmath1 as @xmath4 does ( see equation ( [ eq8 ] ) ) .    in these previous studies",
    "we have shown that the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath9 are independent of the dimensionality .",
    "for the rdsr / rd ( bd / rd ) model we have found that @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite . based on these numerical estimates we have conjectured the following exact values @xmath67 and @xmath68 for rdsr / rd , and @xmath15 and @xmath69 for bd / rd . very recently",
    ", this early conjecture has proved to be correct by using an exact analysis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these values allowed us to formulate another conjecture by statintg that @xmath70 for both models @xcite .",
    "also , we have shown that the stochastic representation of the rdsr / rd model is given by @xcite    @xmath71    while for the bd / rd model one has    @xmath72^{2}+\\eta ( { \\mathbf x},t ) ,   \\label{eq31}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 plays the role of an effective surface tension , @xmath74 represents the lateral growth , and @xmath39 is the uncorrelated white - noise term .    within this context , the aim of this work is to perform a systematic study of a wide variety of competitive growth models of the type x / rd , with x = dst ( das sarma - tamboronea ) @xcite , kk ( kim - kosterlitz ) @xcite , lds ( lai - das sarma ) @xcite , wv ( wolf - villain ) @xcite , lc ( large curvature ) @xcite , rdsr @xcite , bd @xcite , bd1 , bd2 and bd3 . the last three ballistic deposition - motivated models are variants of the bd model that will be described in detail below .",
    "the study is focused on the behaviour of the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath9 as well as on the derivation of the stochastic equations of competitive models . for this purpose the manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii and iii the relevant properties of @xmath6 and @xmath9 are addressed and the exact relationship between both exponents is derived , respectively . subsequently , in section iv numerical results obtained by means of monte carlo computer simulations covering all competitive models listed above are presented . after that , in section v , the exact values for the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath9 are obtained for all the studied models .",
    "section vi is devoted to the derivation of the stochastic equations for different competitive models while our conclusions are stated in section vii .",
    "in previous papers @xcite we have shown that for the rdsr / rd and the bd / rd models , the values of the exponents @xmath9 and @xmath6 are independent of the dimensionality of the substrate . furthermore , our study leads us to conjecture a simple relationship between them , namely @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , we have also proposed and numerically tested the following phenomenological dynamic scaling ansatz for both the rdrs / rd and the bd / rd models @xcite    @xmath75    where x @xmath63 rdsr or bd depending on the model and @xmath38 is a suitable scaling function . now",
    ", if we restrict the previous anzats by considering variations of @xmath1 only ( i.e. fixing @xmath22 ) , equation ( [ ecu.anzats0 ] ) can be written as    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is a suitable scaling function such that : ( i ) @xmath78 for @xmath79 , ( ii ) @xmath80 for @xmath81 in the intermediate regimen , and ( iii ) @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the anzats given by equation ( [ ecu.anzats ] ) is valid for the three regimens ( @xmath84 ) while the previous one , given by equation ( [ ecu.anzats0 ] ) , only holds for regimes ( ii ) and ( iii ) with @xmath85 .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that by fixing the lattice size one also fixes the crossover time @xmath64 that depends on @xmath22 . in order to check the validity of the new anzats ,",
    "figure 1 shows log - log plots of @xmath86 versus @xmath87 as obtained in @xmath88 dimensions , by using values of @xmath1 within the range @xmath89 , and for both models . here",
    ", we have taken @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the rdsr / rd and the bd / rd models , respectively .     versus @xmath87 where x = rdrs , bd .",
    "results obtained for different values of @xmath1 ( @xmath89 ) and lattices of size @xmath92 for x = rdrs and @xmath93 for x = bd .",
    "the data corresponding to the bd / rd model have been shifted one decade to the left for the sake of clarity .",
    "the dotted line has slope @xmath11 and has been drawn for the sake of comparison .",
    "more details in the text.,width=566,height=755 ]    considering the short - time regime @xmath52 , or equivalently @xmath79 in equation ( [ ecu.anzats ] ) , we observed that the initial slope is independent of the considered model and it is given by @xmath11 , since the rd process dominates the early stages of growth .",
    "consequently , within the short - time regime , equation ( [ ecu.anzats ] ) can be written as    @xmath94    and , according to the results shown in figure 1 , this relation has to be independent of @xmath1 .",
    "so , this is true only if    @xmath95    this result strongly suggests that the factor @xmath96 already found in the relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath6 @xcite is just @xmath97 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that @xmath98 is independent of the dimensionality of the substrate , and therefore one should expect that equation ( [ dely ] ) would also hold in any dimension .",
    "versus @xmath1 obtained for lattices of different size , as indicated in the figure , and assuming @xmath99 .",
    "the full line has slope @xmath100 and corresponds to the best fit of the data .",
    "the insert shows the same scaled plot but obtained assuming @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "again , the full line with slope @xmath100 corresponds to the best fit of the data.,width=755,height=566 ]    usually , it is observed that the numerical values of the scaling exponents ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath105 ) undergo systematic deviations when the size of the lattices used in the simulations is changed .",
    "figure 2 shows log - log plots of @xmath106 versus @xmath1 as obtained for lattices of different size and taking the bd / rd model . in this figure",
    ", we have added the data corresponding to @xmath104 to the results already shown in paper @xcite . using the exact value @xmath107 , straight lines",
    "are observed , in agreement with equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , and the best fit of the data gives the slope @xmath108 .",
    "however , a rather small systematic deviation of the data , according to the size of the lattice , is observed : the larger the lattice , the smaller the ordinate .",
    "this behaviour is due to high - order corrections to scaling that we have neglected in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "using the roughness exponent obtained by fitting our data , namely @xmath109 for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for @xmath104 , it is possible to achieve an excellent data collapsing , as shown in the inset of figure 2 . in this case , the slope obtained by means of a least - squares fit is also @xmath110 .",
    "summing up , all results shown in figure 2 point out that the scaling anzats given by equation ( [ eq7 ] ) holds for the bd / rd model .",
    "furthermore , we would like to emphasise that the systematic shift of the data observed in figure 2 does not affect the slope of the power law , and consequently the exponent @xmath9 is almost independent of the lattice size ( up to @xmath111 in figure 2 ) .     versus @xmath1 obtained for lattices of different size , as indicated in the figure , and assuming @xmath112 .",
    "the full line has slope @xmath113 and corresponds to the best fit of the data.,width=453,height=302 ]    figure 3 shows log - log plots of @xmath114 versus @xmath1 as obtained for the rdsr / rd model using lattices of different size . in this figure , we have also added the data corresponding to @xmath104 to the results already shown in paper @xcite . using the exact value @xmath115 for @xmath102 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 , straight lines",
    "are observed , in agreement with equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , and the best fit gives the slope @xmath118 .",
    "so , these results show that the values of @xmath9 are not appreciably affected by systematic deviations even when extremely small lattices are used ( up to @xmath104 in the examples of figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for both models we have arrived at the same conclusion in higher dimensions .",
    "more explicitly , we have performed numerical simulations by using @xmath119 in @xmath41 and @xmath120 in @xmath121 and we have found @xmath122 and @xmath123 independently of the dimensionality , for the bd / rd and rdsr / rd models , respectively .",
    "( these results are not shown here for the sake of space ) .",
    "the lack of appreciable finite - size effects in the values of @xmath9 ( up to @xmath104 ) is a rather surprising result .",
    "it should be noticed that a similar behaviour is also found in the exponent @xmath98 for the random deposition model , and it is due to the lack of correlations between different columns of the aggregate .",
    "so , although we have not a convincing explanation for the behaviour of @xmath9 in our case , we think that it may be related in a non - trivial way to the decorrelation induced by the fraction @xmath124 of particles that are deposited according to the random deposition rules , which are expected to play a relevant role precisely for @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we take advantage of the almost negligible dependence of the values of the exponent @xmath9 on the lattice size , as discussed in the previous section , in order to evaluate it by using small lattices for a wide family of competitive models called x / rd . this family of models is defined such that particles of the same type are aggregated according to the rules of a generic discrete model x with probability @xmath1 and according to the rules of rd with probability ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we expect that for this family of models , the dynamics of the rd process would play the same role as in the cases of the rdsr / rd and the bd / rd models .",
    "that is , rd causes the slowing down of correlations among particles .",
    "so , we also expect that equations ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) would be valid , but the values of the exponents @xmath31 and @xmath105 entering in the scaling relationships have to be those of the x model that introduces the correlations among particles .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the general relationship given by equation ( [ dely ] ) will also hold , allowing us to evaluate the exponent @xmath6 after the determination of @xmath9 .",
    "figure 4 shows log - log plots of @xmath7 versus @xmath1 , in @xmath88 , as obtained for the family of models of the type x / rd where x = dst ( das sarma - tamboronea ) @xcite , kk ( kim - kosterlitz ) @xcite , lds ( lai - das sarma ) @xcite , wv ( wolf - villain ) @xcite , lc ( large curvature ) @xcite , rdsr @xcite , bd @xcite , bd1 , bd2 , bd3 .",
    "the last three models are variants of the bd model and the difference between them is due to the rules used for the sticking of the particles that are shown schematically in figure 5 .",
    "in fact , for the bd1 model , when the height of a selected site for the deposition of a particle is lower than that of a neighbouring site , the particle becomes stuck at half height between the selected site and the highest neighbouring site . for the case of the bd2 model ,",
    "when the height of the site selected to deposit a particle is lower than that of a neighbouring site , the particle becomes stuck to the highest neighbouring site but the actual deposition height is decreased by one lattice unit .",
    "finally , for the bd3 model , when the selected site for the deposition of a particle is lower than a neighbouring site , the particle sticks leaving a single hole in the selected column , so after deposition the height of the selected site becomes enlarged by two lattice units .",
    "( see also figure 5 ) .        as shown in figure 4 , the behaviour of @xmath9 exhibits two relevant features . on the one hand ,",
    "the obtained values of @xmath9 are independent of the universality class of the competitive model that introduces the correlations to the aggregate .",
    "so , models belonging to different universality classes may have the same value of @xmath9 , while models belonging to the same universality class may have different values of @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", the exponents @xmath9 obtained in the @xmath125 limit can only assume two possible values that are very close to @xmath126 and @xmath17 .",
    "further support to this statement is given in figure 6 that shows plots of the effective value of the exponent @xmath9 obtained for the family of x / rd models .",
    "so , we conjectured that in the @xmath125 limit the exact values for @xmath127 should be @xmath96 or @xmath128 , depending on the model",
    ". furthermore , due to the large number of models considered , it would not be surprising that the exponent @xmath9 for all models of the type x / rd may assume one of the already found values .",
    "in order to evaluate the exact values of @xmath9 we have used three concepts linking the interface width ( @xmath129 ) to the height difference between two neighbouring sites ( @xmath130 ) in a competitive growth model .",
    "first , we take into account that from the statistical point of view , it is easy to show that if the interface width stops its growth ( i.e. by reaching a saturation value ) , then the height difference between two neighbouring sites must stop its growth too .",
    "secondly , we considered that if the growing stage of the interface width can be described by a power law of the type @xmath131 , then one also has that @xmath132 .",
    "finally , if the dependence of the interface width on @xmath1 is given by another power law , namely @xmath133 , then the relationship @xmath134 must also hold .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the inverse relationships are also valid in all cases .",
    "so , based on these statements we studied the behaviour of @xmath135 in order to obtain the relevant properties of the interface width . the simplest example for the application of the above - discussed concepts",
    "is provided by the rd model . here , the height difference between two neighbouring sites due to the deposition of a single particle can only be increased or reduced by one lattice unit .",
    "so , this height difference corresponds to the displacement of a typical random walk .",
    "this fact allows us to conclude that if @xmath136 ( as usual ) , then @xmath137 and using this result we conclude that @xmath138 , in agreement with the fact that @xmath11 .    considering a competitive growth model ,",
    "let us call `` rd particles '' and `` x particles '' those particles that are deposited according to rd rules and x rules , respectively .",
    "since in the @xmath125 limit the deposition probability of rd particles is larger than that of x particles , the deposition process in an x / rd model can be thought as cycles involving the deposition of @xmath139 rd particles followed by a single x particle ( @xmath139 is the number or rd particles in the cycle @xmath19 ) . also , it is clear that from the statistical point of view , the evolution through this kind of cycles is equivalent to the evolution of any hypothetic model such that the same number @xmath14 of rd particles followed by an x particle is deposited during each cycle , where @xmath14 are the average number of rd particles given by    @xmath140    since the statistical evolution of the height difference @xmath141 is related to the saturation width of the interface according to    @xmath142    our aim is to show that the behaviour of @xmath143 can also be derived from the statistical knowledge of @xmath144 as a function of the deposition cycles .    on the one hand",
    ", it is straightforward to show that for models such as bd / rd , bd1/rd and bd2/rd , the behaviour of @xmath130 in each cycle corresponds to a random walk that after @xmath14 steps returns either ( i ) to its initial position , ( ii ) to a point placed at a distance that is just half of the maximum distance reached from its initial position , or ( iii ) to a neighbouring site of its initial position .",
    "so , these types of competitive models @xmath145 correspond to a random walk that in each cycle walks @xmath14 steps and after that returns to a site placed at a certain distance ( from the starting point ) that is proportional to the maximum distance reached from its initial position , @xmath146 being the proportionality constant . hereafter , this kind of random walk is called `` type a '' .",
    "now , when the number of cycles is large enough the saturation of the interface width is expected to occur and consequently one has    @xmath147    where @xmath36 is the number of cycles .",
    "so , using equation ( [ intervalo1 ] ) it follows that equation ( [ intervalo8 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath148 ( @xmath13 ) , so that equation ( [ hp ] ) gives    @xmath149    on the other hand , it is easy to show that for the bd3/rd , tds / rd , lds / rd , kk / rd , wv / rd , lc / rd and rdsr / rd models , the behaviour of @xmath141 in each cycle corresponds to a random walk that after @xmath14 steps returns to a site placed at a distance @xmath16 from the maximum distance reached during the walk ( we call this random walk `` type b '' ) .",
    "so , after the first cycle one has    @xmath150    then after the second cycle it follows that    @xmath151    and so on . the analytic form of @xmath152 when the number of cycles is large enough can be obtained by following a simple procedure : since after reaching saturation @xmath141 stops growing , in the next cycle after saturation the increment of @xmath141 due to the deposition of @xmath14 rd particles is equal to the effect caused by the subsequent x particle . as we have already discussed , the effect of the additional x particle is just to move towards its initial point @xmath153 step .",
    "so , if before the deposition of the new particle one had @xmath154 ( where @xmath155 is a constant ) , then after that deposition one already has @xmath156 .",
    "then , the difference between them is given by @xmath157 , and it has to be equal to the effect of the @xmath14 rd particles .",
    "so ,    @xmath158    and using equation ( [ hp ] ) one obtains    @xmath159    therefore , we conclude that for all models that can be mapped into random walks of type a and b one has that @xmath15 ( see equation ( [ intervalo9 ] ) ) and @xmath67 ( see equation ( [ intervalo16 ] ) ) , respectively .",
    "these results provide an independent , more general , confirmation of the exact values of the exponents obtained very recently for the rdsr / rd and bd / rd models @xcite . of course ,",
    "by using equation ( [ dely ] ) one can also obtain the exact value of the exponent @xmath6 for any model that can be mapped into the two types of random walks already considered .",
    "it is well known that the stochastic growth equations describing the bd / rd and the rdsr / rd models are the kpz ( kardar - parisi - zhang , see equation ( [ eq31 ] ) ) and the ew ( edwards - wilkinson , see equation ( [ eq22 ] ) ) equations , respectively .",
    "so , both models belong to the same universality class as that of the model that introduces the correlations among particles , namely the x model with @xmath160 and @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "also , using scaling arguments on @xmath1 and the values of @xmath9 and @xmath6 we have found that for the bd / rd model the parameter @xmath1 appears in the linear and non - linear terms of the stochastic equation , taking the form @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( see equation ( [ eq31 ] ) ) , while for the rdsr / rd model the parameter @xmath1 appears as a factor of the form @xmath164 ( see equation ( [ eq22]))@xcite .",
    "so , for any competitive model belonging to the x / rd family we can propose a stochastic growth equation similar to its x model equation where the parameter @xmath1 appears in the linear and non - linear terms .",
    "after that , by using the scaling arguments on @xmath1 and the exact values of @xmath9 and @xmath6 , it is possible to obtain the exact dependence of the prefactors on @xmath1 for any stochastic equation .",
    "this systematic procedure and the results of the previous section allows us to conclude that the behaviour of @xmath144 quantitatively determines the exact dependence of the stochastic equation on @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in table i we have summarized the list of all possible stochastic equations resulting for competitive deposition models belonging to four different universality classes when the competitive process can be mapped into the two types of random walks already considered .",
    "summary of stochastic equations corresponding to models belonging to four different universality classes such that the competitive process can be represented by random walks of type a and b. more details in the text .",
    "+    * iv . conclusions .",
    "* + we have studied a wide family of competitive growth models ( generically called x / rd models ) where particles of the same type are aggregated according to the rules of a generic discrete model x with probability @xmath1 and according to the rules of random deposition ( rd ) with probability ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "first , we have focussed our study on the properties of the exponents related to the interface width @xmath173 and the characteristic crossover time @xmath174 .",
    "we have shown that both exponents are not independent and one has that the exact relationship @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) holds for the bd / rd and rdsr / rd models .",
    "however , we expect that the above relationship would hold for any competitive growth model of the type x / rd .",
    "also , we have found that the values of the exponent @xmath9 do not significantly depend on the finite size of the sample .",
    "this property has allowed us to systematically study competitive growth models using lattices of modest size .",
    "this study shows that @xmath9 exhibits universality and its values , in the limit @xmath13 , are restricted to either @xmath15 or @xmath67 , depending on the model considered .",
    "furthermore , by using a correspondence between two neighbouring sites in the discrete model @xmath175 and two types of random walks , we have determined the exact values of the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "when the height difference between two neighbour sites corresponds to a random walk of type a that in each cycle walks @xmath14 steps and after that returns to a point at a distance proportional to its initial position , one has @xmath126 and consequently @xmath176 . on the other hand , when the height difference between two neighbouring sites corresponds to a random walk of type b that after @xmath14 steps moves towards its initial position @xmath153 steps , we have found that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    finally , using the exact values for the exponents @xmath9 and @xmath6 , as well as a scaling argument on @xmath1 , we have derived the stochastic growth equations for the whole family of competitive models studied .",
    "so , we conclude that the properties of the height difference at saturation @xmath144 in the * discrete model * , which determines the behaviour of @xmath7 , have allowed us to quantitatively determine the exact dependence on @xmath1 of the * coarse - grained * stochastic equations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the derivation of this type of coarse - grained stochastic equations , based on the growing rules of the corresponding microscopic models , is an interesting challenge in the field of modern statistical physics .",
    "so , we expect that the relationships between microscopic parameters and stochastic equations obtained and discussed in this work will stimulate studies of this field .",
