    "abundant circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that black - hole feedback suppresses star formation in massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but a deep mystery remains : how does accretion fueling of the black - hole engine become closely coupled with the vast hot - gas atmosphere surrounding it ?",
    "precipitation - driven feedback models are providing particularly promising answers to this question .",
    "numerical simulations show that cool clouds can precipitate out of a galaxy s hot - gas atmosphere via thermal instability if it is in a state of global thermal balance , with heating approximately equal to cooling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the critical criterion for precipitation depends on the ratio between the time @xmath5 required for gas at temperature @xmath6 to radiate @xmath7 per particle and the free - fall time @xmath8 required for a dense cool cloud to fall from a radius @xmath9 at the local gravitational acceleration @xmath10 .",
    "when the average @xmath11 ratio is less than 10 , then cooling is fast enough for some of the hot gas to condense into cold clouds and precipitate out of the hot medium .",
    "precipitation itself plays an essential role in maintaining the required state of global thermal balance because it provides fuel for accretion .",
    "recent numerical simulations of this feedback loop have been very encouraging , because they show that  chaotic cold accretion \" of precipitating clouds can produce a black - hole fueling rate two orders of magnitude greater than the bondi rate and can therefore generate a feedback response that brings the system into approximate balance at @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have recently presented measurements of galaxy - cluster atmospheres that strongly support this picture .",
    "the amount of multiphase gas in the cores of galaxy clusters steeply anticorrelates with @xmath13 , indicating that the precipitation rate , and therefore the feedback response , depends very strongly on this parameter @xcite .",
    "even more compelling is the finding that @xmath12 is a global lower limit on this ratio at all radii and at all temperatures among galaxy clusters in the _ accept _ database @xcite .",
    "here we show , using _",
    "observations originally presented by @xcite , that the @xmath12 precipitation limit also applies to massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "those observations revealed a close link between the presence of extended multiphase gas in ellipticals and the thermodynamic properties of their hot - gas atmospheres .",
    "this paper interprets that finding in terms of a model combining supernova - driven outflows and precipitation - driven feedback .",
    "section  2 briefly summarizes the key features of the werner et al .",
    "section  3 shows that type ia supernovae ( snia ) can drive outflows that sweep stellar ejecta out of ellipticals with velocity dispersion @xmath14 but can not prevent precipitation within the central kiloparsec .",
    "section  4 argues that outbursts of precipitation - driven black - hole feedback at @xmath15  kpc prevent @xmath5 from falling much below @xmath16 .",
    "section  5 shows that the black hole s jets are poorly coupled to the 110 kpc region but usually manage to maintain an isentropic core at @xmath17  kpc .",
    "section  6 concludes by hypothesizing that black - hole feedback shuts off star formation in massive ellipticals by switching on supernova sweeping .",
    "profiles of electron density ( @xmath18 ) , temperature ( @xmath6 ) , and entropy index ( @xmath19 ) for ten massive elliptical galaxies from @xcite are shown in figure  1 as functions of radius @xmath20 . dashed lines and blue symbols show the subset of five with multiphase emission - line nebulae at @xmath2110 kpc . solid lines and red or purple symbols show the subset of five without extended nebulae .",
    "the density panel shows that @xmath22 is a good approximation at 110  kpc for the single - phase ellipticals , whereas the multiphase ellipticals tend to have density profiles closer to @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature panel shows that the multiphase galaxies are systematically cooler than those without extended nebulae . in this sample",
    ", the temperature difference corresponds to a difference in velocity dispersion : the five galaxies with extended nebulae have one - dimensional velocity dispersions in the range @xmath24@xmath25 , and the five without extended nebulae have @xmath26@xmath27 , according to the hyperleda database .     +    combining @xmath28 and @xmath29 to obtain",
    "@xmath30 reveals that the hot atmospheres of multiphase ellipticals distinctly differ from those without extended nebulae . the single - phase elliptical galaxies follow the power law @xmath31 in the 110  kpc range , whereas the multiphase elliptical galaxies tend to follow @xmath32 .",
    "this latter power law corresponds to the precipitation threshold predicted by @xcite and confirmed in central cluster galaxies by @xcite . setting @xmath33 yields @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the usual radiative cooling function for gas in collisional ionization equilibrium and depends on elemental abundances in this temperature range , with @xmath36 for a solar - abundance plasma . just as in central cluster galaxies ,",
    "the entropy profiles of elliptical galaxies with extended multiphase gas at 110  kpc appear to be maintained by precipitation - driven feedback , strengthening the overall case for this mechanism .",
    "however , something else must be happening at these radii in single - phase elliptical galaxies .",
    "we propose that the difference between multiphase and single - phase ellipticals arises because snia are successfully sweeping gas ejected by the old stellar population out of the single - phase ellipticals .",
    "stars belonging to an old stellar population shed matter with a specific mass ejection rate @xmath37 where @xmath38 is within a factor of 2 of unity but depends somewhat on the age of the stellar population and the low - mass tail of the stellar mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ejecta can not linger , because otherwise the galaxy would either contain more gas or would be forming stars at a rate equivalent to the mass ejection rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead",
    ", the time - averaged outflow rate of stellar ejecta at radius @xmath9 must be @xmath39 where we have assumed that the stellar mass - density profile is approximately @xmath40 with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath41 , for which the stellar mass within radius @xmath9 is @xmath42 . given the power - law electron density profile shown in figure  1 , the average outflow velocity is then @xmath43 implying that a steady outflow would be subsonic and therefore close to hydrostatic equilibrium .    in order to illustrate how supernovae can produce an outflow with the power - law entropy profile observed in single - phase ellipticals ,",
    "let us temporarily ignore radiative cooling .",
    "in that case the entropy equation for steadily outflowing gas can be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the heating rate per unit volume , @xmath46 is the number density of gas particles , @xmath47 is the mean mass per gas particle , and @xmath48 is the local stellar mass density . the first term accounts for the change in specific entropy due to heat input , and the second accounts for introduction of new particles into the system .",
    "supernovae are not the only heat source .",
    "mass ejected from old stars carries a specific kinetic energy per particle @xmath49 that becomes thermalized in the ambient medium as the ejecta merge with it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the specific energy ejected by the old stellar population ( @xmath50 ) therefore separates into a supernova heating term ( @xmath51 ) and a kinetic energy term : @xmath52 \\ ; \\ ; , \\ ] ] substituting for @xmath45 in the entropy equation and multiplying by @xmath53 then leads to @xmath54 \\frac { 3 \\rho _ * } { \\bar{\\rho } _ * }   \\ , \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the mean stellar mass density within @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the power - law slope of the radial entropy gradient depends primarily on the ratio of specific energy per ejected particle to thermal energy per ambient particle .",
    "if that ratio exceeds 5/3 , then the entropy gradient of the outflow will be positive , and if it does not , then the entropy gradient will be negative and convectively unstable .",
    "furthermore , the density factor can be neglected for the stellar mass distribution we have assumed , in which @xmath56 .",
    "this relationship conveniently allows us to infer the supernova heating rate from the slope of the entropy gradient at 110  kpc . for the single - phase ellipticals , in which @xmath57",
    ", we obtain @xmath58 since they have @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in order to impart this much energy to the matter ejected by the old stellar population ,",
    "the specific snia rate needs to be @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the heat energy introduced per supernova into the ambient gas .",
    "this result is broadly consistent with direct observations of snia rates in old stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and validates our outflow analysis .",
    "however , it is in tension with the iron abundances observed in the hot gas , which are approximately solar .",
    "an iron yield @xmath63 per supernova is equivalent to a mass fraction @xmath64 relative to all the stellar ejecta , amounting to @xmath65 times the solar abundance .",
    "reconciliation of the observed gas - phase iron abundances with the observed snia rate would therefore seem to require the newly - produced iron to be poorly mixed with the ambient gas , at least within the central 10  kpc of the outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "now let us return to the issue of radiative cooling .",
    "the cooling - free outflow solution for single - phase ellipticals must become invalid at small radii , because radiative cooling per unit volume scales as @xmath66 while heating scales as @xmath67 . defining @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath69 leads to the following expression for the unstable locus of supernova - heating balance for a galaxy with @xmath70 and @xmath60 : @xmath71 this is shown with a green dashed line in the bottom panel of figure  1 .",
    "the power - law profiles of density and entropy observed in single - phase ellipticals do indeed break where they intersect this locus , indicating that supernova heating exceeds radiative cooling at larger radii , and that supernova sweeping alone can not rid the inner @xmath72  kpc of its stellar ejecta .",
    "inside of @xmath73  kpc , nine of the ten galaxies in our sample become isentropic , with core entropy @xmath74 .",
    "these all have radio power @xmath75 . adopting the conversion from radio power to jet power from @xcite indicates a typical jet power @xmath76 . the total power available from bondi accretion",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be estimated from the typical core entropy and black hole mass ( @xmath77 ) for these galaxies : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "dividing the jet power by this value gives an inferred jet efficiency @xmath81 , meaning that the jets in these galaxies can plausibly be fueled by bondi accretion onto the central black hole at the present time .",
    "the tenth galaxy is ngc  4261 , shown with purple stars in figure 1 .",
    "it is the only one that drops below the precipitation threshold within @xmath82 ( see figure 2 ) , and its radio luminosity ( @xmath83 ) corresponds to a jet power @xmath84 , almost two orders of magnitude greater than in the other galaxies . from the central black - hole mass of this galaxy ( @xmath85 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its entropy in the innermost bin , we infer a total bondi power @xmath86 , which would imply an implausibly large jet efficiency @xmath87 .",
    "we therefore suggest that ngc  4261 may be a case in which cold chaotic accretion triggered by precipitation of cold clouds has temporarily boosted the accretion rate far above the bondi level , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "+    in all cases , the jet power greatly exceeds the @xmath88 x - ray luminosity from @xmath15  kpc , implying that the jets are poorly coupled to the isentropic core and deposit most of their energy at larger radii .",
    "this finding agrees with the radio morphologies of the jets , which extend well beyond the central kpc . tapping a small percentage of their power",
    "would compensate for cooling within @xmath72  kpc , and the flatness of the inner entropy profiles suggests that some combination of turbulent mixing and convection distributes that heat energy .",
    "furthermore , if the jet ever fails to couple to the isentropic core , the core will fill up with stellar ejecta , thereby lowering @xmath89 until the system reaches the precipitation limit . according to models of cold chaotic accretion ,",
    "the jet power should then rise by two orders of magnitude , as observed in ngc 4261 . in this sense ,",
    "precipitation - driven feedback is like a backup system which ensures that the central cooling time remains @xmath90 , should either supernova sweeping or bondi accretion ever fail to keep stellar ejecta from accumulating within the galaxy .",
    "a simple scaling argument suggests that the jets couple poorly to the inner regions of ellipticals because of their power . in an isothermal potential , gas at the precipitation threshold",
    "has @xmath91 and @xmath92 , implying @xmath23 and @xmath93 .",
    "setting @xmath94 therefore gives @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the x - ray luminosity .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the shock velocity @xmath97 driven through gas with this density profile by a jet of power @xmath98 by setting @xmath99 and obtaining @xmath100 . for this shock velocity , the entropy jump condition from @xcite yields an entropy increment @xmath101 that is independent of radius",
    ".    in other words , jet outbursts of the power observed in nine of these ten systems suffice only to boost @xmath89 to the observed level and have little effect on the @xmath7210 kpc region .",
    "that is because they deposit the bulk of their power at greater radii .",
    "most of it is probably thermalized beyond the radius @xmath102 at which jet - driven shocks become subsonic .",
    "this is also the radius at which the typical jet power is comparable to the x - ray luminosity in the precipitating configuration , which is probably not a coincidence .",
    "furthermore , the excellent agreement of single - phase ellipticals with the power - law supernova sweeping model , along with the lack of scatter in their @xmath30 profiles at @xmath103  kpc , supports the idea that most of their jet power is deposited farther out .",
    "even ngc  4261 agrees well with the others at 110 kpc , implying that the vast majority of its @xmath84 jet power passes straight through the 110 kpc region with very little dissipation .",
    "we conclude with a hypothesis for the cessation of star formation known as quenching .",
    "it would appear from the data presented in  2 that black - hole feedback alone can not completely quench massive elliptical galaxies because some have persistent multiphase gas . instead , massive elliptical galaxies separate into two groups . in single - phase ellipticals ,",
    "snia keep stellar ejecta from accumulating by sweeping it out of the central 110 kpc (  3 ) . in multiphase ellipticals",
    ", supernova heating can not quite overcome radiative cooling in the 110 kpc region .",
    "these galaxies therefore fall into a precipitating state in which black - hole feedback maintains @xmath94 and can can not entirely shut off star formation (  4 ) .",
    "jet power can fluctuate between @xmath104 ( bondi - like accretion ) and @xmath84 ( cold chaotic accretion ) without disrupting the 110  kpc region because the jets deposit most of their energy beyond @xmath105  kpc (  5 ) .",
    "why then are the five ellipticals with @xmath106 fully quenched while low - level star formation persists in the five multiphase ellipticals with lower velocity dispersions ?",
    "some insight can be gained by comparing @xmath107 with @xmath108 . in galaxies with @xmath109",
    ", the interstellar medium can be thermally unstable even if supernova heating exceeds radiative cooling .",
    "we therefore expect those galaxies to experience multiphase circulation in which snia drive hot gas out of the central regions where the stars are but cool clouds precipitate back in from the margins . in contrast",
    ", galaxies with @xmath110 can drive outflows capable of shutting off precipitation , by raising @xmath111 high enough to prevent the outflowing gas from cooling after it leaves the galaxy .",
    "the condition for avoiding potentially star - forming multiphase gas is then @xmath112 implying that galaxies with @xmath113 @xmath114 should be embedded within a precipitating circumgalactic medium .",
    "intriguingly , this result implies that quenching depends more directly on the concentration of stellar mass toward the center of a galaxy than on the total stellar mass itself , in qualitative agreement with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it also implies that quenching requires a greater value of @xmath115 at earlier times , when the stellar population is younger and @xmath116 is greater .",
    "however , the bottom panel of figure  1 implies that something more is needed for quenching to be complete .",
    "we hypothesize that black - hole feedback outbursts are also required to flip massive ellipticals with @xmath110 from the precipitation locus to a supernova - sweeping state .",
    "this  black - hole feedback valve \" can accomplish the task with an outburst powerful enough to produce an entropy increase @xmath117 .",
    "it will be interesting to test this quenching mechanism and see how it plays out in simulated elliptical galaxies .",
