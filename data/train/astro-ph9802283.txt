    "the rapid aperiodic and quasiperiodic variability of the x - ray signals from galactic black - hole candidates ( gbhcs ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( for a review see @xcite ) contains valuable information about the source of high - energy emission in these objects .",
    "its typical timescales , typical repetition frequency , power spectrum density ( psd ) , autocorrelation function , time lags between different energy bands etc . give hints toward important parameters such as the extent of the emitting region , the dominant microscopic timescales , the dominant emission mechanism and the geometry of the source .    with the new generation of x - ray telescopes such as the pca and the hexte on board rxte it is now possible to measure the above properties of the rapid variability of x - ray binaries in great detail with high timing resolution and good spectral resolution .",
    "as we will see in this paper , the photon - energy dependence of the rapid aperiodic variability can provide important diagnostics of the nature of the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "early measurements of the fourier - frequency dependence of time lags between the signals in different x - ray energy channels from gbhcs ( @xcite , @xcite ) have been interpreted as evidence that comptonization of soft photons in a hot , uniform plasma could not be the dominating mechanism for the production of hard x - rays .",
    "this conslusion , however , is strongly geometry - dependent and does not hold for a very extended , inhomogeneous comptonizing region , as was recently found by kazanas et al . ( 1997 ) . in that and in two subsequent papers",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) the effect of radial density gradients in the hot comptonizing regions in gbhcs on the power density spectra and the phase and time lags between different energy bands were discussed . from the comparison of the measured fourier - frequency dependent time",
    "lags between two energy channels of the signal from cyg  x-1 , they deduced that a radial density dependence @xmath0 in the comptonizing hot plasma is appropriate to account for the observed hard time lags and the hard x - ray spectrum at the same time .",
    "however , their work was restricted to a geometry with a central soft photon source surrounded by a spherical corona of hot comptonizing plasma .",
    "furthermore , the density was the only parameter allowed to vary radially .    in this paper , we extend the investigation of the effects of comptonization the rapid variability in x - ray binaries , discussing two fundamentally different source geometries and radial gradients of other physical parameters , such as the electron temperature .",
    "this is done primarily with monte - carlo simulations of instantaneous flares of soft radiation ( described as a @xmath1-function in time ) , being comptonized by the x - ray emitting region .",
    "the generalization to the case of multiple , randomly distributed flares ( shot - noise ) is straightforward .",
    "the light curves resulting from the monte - carlo simulations are then fourier transformed , and the psd as well as the fourier - frequency dependent phase and time lags between different energy bands are calculated .    in section 2 , we describe our monte - carlo simulations leading to the energy - dependent light curves for the different geometrical situations , together with analytical approximations for these light curves .",
    "their fourier transforms and the corresponding time lags between different energy bands will be discussed in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we investigate specific differences between the psds and hard time lags resulting from different geometries and compare the predictions of both scenarios to the power spectra and hard time lags observed for some gbhcs",
    ". we will suggest further observational tests which could either confirm a preferred geometry , or rule out to the comptonization scenario in general .",
    "for our time - dependent monte - carlo simulations on compton scattering in a hot plasma we use an improved version of the comptonization code developed by canfield et al .",

    "it can handle spherically symmetric or slab geometry of the comptonizing region with thermal soft photon sources located in the center of the comptonizing cloud , distributed throughout the cloud , and/or located outside the comptonizing region .",
    "all parameters ( such as density , electron temperature , radiation temperature of an internal soft photon field ) may have arbitrary radial dependencies within the cloud .",
    "practically , we split the comptonizing region into 20 radial zones , each zone having the same ( radial ) thomson depth , within which the parameters are set to a constant value corresponding to an average of the respective radial dependencies over the zone . for several of our simulations ,",
    "we run test simulations with a finer radial grid ( 50  100 zones ) in order to check that the step function dependency of the parameters in the comptonizing region does not introduce artificial structures in the light curves .",
    "no significant difference to our simpler ( and faster ) 20 zone simulations has been found in any of these tests .    in this paper , we focus on two basic situations with respect to the location of the flaring soft photon source : a source located at the center of the cloud and a source located outside the cloud .",
    "the former situation is representative of an accretion - disk - corona model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) where photons resulting from a flare in the cold , optically thick disk are compton - upscattered by the hot corona to produce the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "the latter case represents a hot - inner - disk model ( @xcite ) or an advection - dominated accretion flow ( @xcite , @xcite ) , assuming that a soft photon flare occurs in the cold , optically thick outer disk and its radiation impinges on the hot inner disk ( torus ) , producing the hard x - rays via compton upscattering .    for all simulations shown in this paper ,",
    "the soft photon spectrum is assumed to be a thermal blackbody of @xmath2  kev .    for each of the light curves resulting from central soft photon injection ,",
    "a total of @xmath3 photons , being injected instantaneously at @xmath4 , are simulated .",
    "the photons leaving the system are collected in 5 energy channels and in equal time steps appropriate to reveal the detailed structure of the light curves ( typically @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the comptonizing region ) .",
    "the light curves resulting from external soft photon injection turn out to be mathematically more complicated and require a higher numerical signal - to - noise ratio in order to yield reliable fourier transforms .",
    "therefore , the simulations for this geometry have been carried out with 25  million photons each .    for both geometries",
    ", we investigate the effect of density and temperature gradients within the hot comptonizing region .",
    "1 shows the energy - dependent light curves for the case of a central photon source inside a homogeneous cloud .",
    "we did further simulations for comptonizing clouds with density profiles @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 and for clouds with temperature profiles of the same form .",
    "generally , the light curves for a central source can be parametrized by a gamma distribution , @xmath10 as suggested by hua et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , where @xmath11 is the heaviside function and @xmath12 is a normalization constant . inspecting the simulated light curves for the different cases , we find that both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are energy - dependent in both the case of a homogeneous cloud as well as a cloud with parameters spatially varying .",
    "this is in contradiction to the finding of hua et al .",
    "( 1997b ) who found a qualitative difference between the light curves in these two cases .",
    "according to our simulations , the difference between these two situations is purely quantitative .",
    "the choice of a much smaller homogeneous comptonizing region compared to the case of an extended cloud with @xmath15 leads to the fact that the differences in the short - term behavior ( @xmath16 ) for different energy channels only affects very high fourier frequencies for which no phase and time lags are measured and which have not been resolved in the simulations of hua et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "however , in the situation investigated there , this effect only affects very high fourier frequencies for which no phase and time lags are measured anyway .",
    "both the early - time slope @xmath13 , describing the light curve immediately after the onset of the flare ( accounting for the light travel time ) and the cut - off time @xmath14 ( which is of the order of the photon escape time @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) tend to increase with photon energy .",
    "the assumption of a density gradient ( conserving the total thomson depth @xmath19 and extent @xmath6 of the region ) leads to a considerable reduction of @xmath13 and a moderate reduction of @xmath14 .",
    "these changes are much more pronounced for the high photon energies than for the lower energy channels , implying that the energy dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is reduced due to the spatial gradient .",
    "the assumption of a temperature gradient has a similar effect on the light curve parameters than a density gradient . in both cases , scattering in the outer regions of the cloud",
    "becomes less efficient , leading to a steeper light curve .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 yielding a good representation of the simulated light curves for central soft photon injection are listed in table 1 .",
    "however , we point out that in the case of radial parameter gradients the light curves of the higher two energy channels show significant deviations from a power - law at the onset of the flare of comptonized radiation . this issue will be discussed further in the next section .    for the case of radiation impinging from outside onto the comptonizing region",
    ", we assume that the source of soft photons is located close to the outer boundary of the hot plasma region , implying that the radiation enters the comptonizing region at angle cosines with respect to the radial direction which are randomly distributed between -1 and 0 . in this case",
    ", the light curve can generally be parametrized by the sum of a power - law resulting from single scattering over the light crossing time through the source , @xmath20 plus a multiple scattering component , described by a light curve of the form of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , i. e. @xmath21 where @xmath12 and @xmath22 are normalization constants .",
    "2 and 3 illustrate the energy - dependent light curves for scattering of an external soft radiation flare in a homogeneous and an inhomogeneous cloud , respectively , of the same total radial extent and thomson depth .",
    "the resulting comptonization spectra of these two situations are similar to the ones obtained from the situations assumed in the case of central photon injection .    for a homogeneous cloud , clearly the first term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is dominant , i. e. the parametrization is basically the same as in the case of a central soft photon source , except in the two highest photon energy channels , where the light curves at @xmath23 are given by a broken power - law with a flat early - time slope . with a more pronounced radial density gradient , the second term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes more important and dominates the shape of all light curves until @xmath24 for density profiles with @xmath25 , where @xmath7 .",
    "however , although the parametrization of the light curves for a uniform cloud scattering radiation impinging from the outside is formally the same as for scattering of radiation coming from a central soft photon source , the energy - dependence of the spectral index @xmath13 of the light curves for @xmath23 is significantly weaker in the case of the external source .",
    "this becomes obvious when comparing tables 1 and 2 , where the parameters characterizing the light curves for the two geometrically different situations are listed , and from inspection of fig .",
    "10 , where the energy - dependence of the early - time slope of the light curves is plotted .",
    "it should be noted that the light curves resulting from our numerical simulations differ significantly from the analytical results of lightman and rybicki ( 1979b ) for the problem of inverse - compton reflection off a hot plasma .",
    "this descrepancy is due to the fact that lightman and rybicki used the photon escape probability corresponding to the case of a semi - infinite , plane - parallel medium with infinite thomson depth .",
    "lightman and rybicki ( 1997a ) have shown that the inverse - compton spectrum in that case is basically given by a power - law of photon index 1 , which is much harder than the observed hard x - ray spectrum of galactic black - hole candidates ( typically @xmath26 ",
    ". therefore we have to consider a medium of finite thomson depth , @xmath28 .",
    "we performed a numerical fourier transform for each energy band in our simulated light curves and calculated the resulting power spectrum densities .",
    "4 and 5 show the psd corresponding to the simulations for external soft photon injection for the cases @xmath29 and @xmath8 , respectively , illustrated in figs . 2 and 3 . knowing the fourier transform @xmath30 of the light curve in energy channel @xmath31 at fourier frequency @xmath32 , the phase difference @xmath33 between two energy channels @xmath31 and @xmath34 can be computed .",
    "the resulting time lag between the signals in different energy channels is then given by @xmath35 .",
    "the time lags as a function of fourier period @xmath36 resulting from our simulations for central soft photon injection into a homogeneous and a @xmath8 cloud , respectively , are displayed in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "figs . 8 and 9",
    "show the respective time lag curves for the case of external soft photon injection . in order to suppress numerical noise contained in the simulated light curves , we use smooth analytical curves following the light curves closely for the computation of the hard time lags . in figs . 4 and 5 ,",
    "the psds from our analytical representations ( thin curves ) are shown in comparison to the psds of the simulated light curves ( thick curves ) .",
    "the figures demonstrate that the simulated signal of the highest energy channel ( with the worst photon statistics ) is strongly dominated by numerical noise at high frequencies .",
    "we therefore do not consider our results concerning the highest energy channel ( 31 - 70  kev ) in the case of external photon injection as fully reliable .    generally , for both the central and the external soft photon source , the time lags are increasing with fourier period for frequencies @xmath37 in the case of a central soft photon source and for frequencies @xmath38 for an external soft photon source . for lower frequencies ( longer periods )",
    "the respective time lags turn into a flat curve where @xmath39 .    for an external soft photon source ,",
    "no significant deviation from linearity is found , independent of parameter gradients or photon energy , except at the lowest photon energies which are close to the energy of the injected soft photons .",
    "however , in the case of a central source the gradual rise of the light curves at the onset of the flare , systematically deviating from a power law , causes a flattening of the time lag dependence on the fourier period with increasing photon energies of the respective channels . in fig .",
    "6 ( central source , @xmath29 ) , the time lag between the lowest two energy channels depends on the fourier period to a power greater than unity , which we attribute to the fact that the early - time slopes of the two light curves in these energy channels are nearly equal ( see below ) .",
    "the effect of the flattening of the hard - time - lag curve with increasing photon energy becomes more pronounced with a steeper density gradient . for a density @xmath40 ,",
    "especially the hard lag between the lower energy channels deviates from a simple power - law ; for the higher channels the curves show power - law behaviour with a slope smaller than unity . in this case , the long - period behavior is no longer flat , but the hard time lag begins to decline with fourier period for frequencies @xmath41 .",
    "the power spectra and hard time lags resulting from our simulations show a significantly different energy dependence for the two different geometries . in the case of the central soft photon source and a density or temperature gradient , the psd is flat for low photon energies , while for higher photon energies it becomes gradually steeper to higher fourier frequencies . for the @xmath8 case ,",
    "this can be approximated by a broken power - law with break frequency @xmath42 . for the solid sphere , the psd",
    "can generally well be described by a broken power - law with flat low - frequency slope and the high - frequency slope increasing with photon energy .    for an external soft photon source the psd",
    "can roughly be represented by a broken power - law for all energy channels with break frequency @xmath43 and a flat low - frequency branch .",
    "the power - law slope depends only very weakly on photon energy and is always close to 2 .",
    "both the analytical representations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of the light curves in the two geometrical cases considered here can be fourier - transformed analytically .",

    ", the hard time lags between two energy bands in the high- and low - frequency limits are @xmath52 as found by hua et al .",
    "( 1997b ) . if the values of @xmath13 for two energy bands are exactly equal , then it is easy to show that the phase difference in the high - frequency limit is @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    from our simulations , we find that the fourier transforms of the light curves in the case of an external photon source are dominated by the second term in eqs . 5 and 7 , respectively , in both limits @xmath55 and @xmath56 , if the scattering medium has a strong radial density gradient ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the high - frequency limit of the fourier transform ( 5 ) is completely determined by the shape of the light curves at @xmath23 and can always be obtained by simply fourier transforming a function for the form @xmath58 , describing the light curve for @xmath23 , without accounting for the cutoff at @xmath59 or @xmath60 , respectively . therefore , for @xmath56 we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 for a weak density gradient ( @xmath63 ) and low photon energies and @xmath64 else .",
    "however , as mentioned in the previous section , this relation between the early - time slope of the light curve and the high - frequency branch of the psd does not apply to the case of the free - fall density gradient @xmath65 and internal soft photon injection , where the light curves at the onset of the flare significantly deviate from a power - law behavior , which leads to a deviation of the psd from a simple power - law at high fourier frequencies .    for the hard time",
    "lags we find in the case of external soft photon injection @xmath66    the qualitative similarity of the asymptotic expressions for the fourier transforms for both injection geometries is a consequence of the fact that in both cases the rise of the compton - scattered flare is described by a power - law , which results in a power - law psd at high frequencies , while for both geometries there is a fast decay after one light - crossing time @xmath67 , which always results in a constant psd at frequencies @xmath68 .",

( 11 ) it is obvious that the time lags between different energy bands remain unaffected by the summation of multiple shots , and in the psd only near the average shot repetition frequency some additional structure is introduced . therefore the asymptotic expressions ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) yield a very good description of the expected high - frequency branch of the psd from a model of comptonized random shots of soft photons in the two geometries discussed here , and eqs .",

    "the analysis of the frequency - dependent light curves and their fourier transforms enables us to extract important information from observed or observable properties of the rapid aperiodic variability of galactic black - hole candidates .",
    "observable quantities on which we will focus now are : a ) the high - frequency power - law index of the psd and its photon - energy dependence , b ) the turnover frequency of the psd , c ) the photon - energy dependence of hard time lags with respect to the soft x - rays , d ) the turnover frequency in the hard - time - lag versus fourier - period relation .    as we have seen in the previous section , the power - law index of the psd at high fourier frequencies is dominated by the short - term behaviour of individual flares and is described by the parameter @xmath13 or @xmath74 of eqs .",

    "( 16 ) reveals a major problem of the comptonization scenario as an explanation for the rapid aperiodic variability of galactic black - hole candidates in general .",
    "if indeed the spectral breaks in the psd and the hard time lags are the result of inverse compton scattering as analyzed in the previous sections , then the estimated size of the comptonizing region is much larger than the expected extent of an accretion - disk corona .",
    "this problem is obviously even more severe for the case of external photons impinging on a hot inner - disk torus .",
    "the problem resulting from the break in the power spectrum could be overcome assuming a soft radiation flare of much longer intrinsic duration than the light crossing time of the inner disk region . in this case",
    ", the turnover frequency of the psd would yield an estimate for the typical intrinsic duration of the flare , @xmath96  110  s , which , e. g. , is of the order of the radial drift time scale in the inner accretion disk .",
    "this would generally produce an additional break in the psd at the turnover frequency of the single - shot power spectrum . a second break or a smooth steepening of the psd around @xmath97  hz",
    "has indeed been observed in the low states of several gbhcs .",
    "however , we expect that the assumption of a broad flare as opposed to a @xmath1-shot in time does not shift the turnover of the hard - time - lag versus fourier - period curves if it is indeed due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "therefore , the fourier - period dependence of the hard time lag is still a puzzle in the framework of comptonization models .",
    "as one possible solution to this problem we suggest an intrinsic hardening of the soft input photon spectrum during the evolution of an extended flare , which could be caused by a hot spot in the accretion disk heating up as it spirals inward .",
    "this idea will be worked out in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we presented a systematic study on the predicted fourier power spectra and hard time lags resulting from two fundamentally different geometries in comptonization models for the hard x - ray emission of galactic black - hole candidates : a flaring soft photon source located in the center of the comptonizing region ( e. g. , a hot corona ) and a soft photon source located outside a hot inner disk region .",
    "the different scenarios yield different predictions for the fourier power spectra and fundamental differences in the photon - energy dependence of the fourier psd slope and of the slope describing the hard - time - lag versus fourier - period relation .",
    "we found that comptonization of flares of external soft radiation generally leads to a weak photon - energy dependence of the power spectrum and the hard time lag , with the power spectrum being marginally consistent with the psd measured for gx  339 - 1 , but significantly steeper than for cyg  x-1 .",
    "comptonization of centrally injected soft photon flares , in turn , leads to a significant photon - energy dependence in the psd power - law slope at high fourier frequencies and photon - energy dependent deviations from linearity of the hard time lags as a function of fourier period . with a density gradient @xmath15 ,",
    "the simulated psd for medium - energy x - rays is consistent with the slope observed in cyg  x-1 .",
    "the turnover in the fourier - frequency dependent hard time lag curve poses a severe challenge to comptonization models for the rapid aperiodic variability in gbhcs in general due to the resulting large size estimates .",
    "detailed measurements of the energy - dependent properties of the rapid aperiodic gbhc x - ray variability are strongly encouraged . using the diagnostic tools developed in this paper , they can shed light on the question of the geometry of black - hole accretion disks and the location of the comptonizing region and may serve to rule out a specific geometry or even the comptonization models as a mechanism involved in the rapid aperiodic x - ray variability of galactic black - hole candidates in general .",

    "<S> the photon - energy dependent light curves , their fourier transforms , power spectra and fourier - period dependent time lags of hard photons with respect to softer photons are discussed . on the basis of a comparison with existing data we find arguments against comptonization of external soft radiation as well as comptonization in a homogeneous medium as dominant mechanisms for the rapid aperiodic variability in galactic black - hole candidates . </S>",
