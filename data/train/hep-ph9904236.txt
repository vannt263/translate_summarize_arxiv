    "the conventional framework for particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) assumes that the fundamental mass scale of nature is the planck mass : @xmath15 gev .",
    "it is then natural to ask : why are the masses of the elementary particles so small ? proposed solutions to this hierarchy problem have a common feature : new non - perturbative gauge interactions dynamically generate a much lower scale , @xmath16 , from which electroweak symmetry breaking is generated , and hence all the masses of the known elementary particles .",
    "schematically , this mass hierarchy is @xmath17 in supersymmetric theories , @xmath16 is the scale at which supersymmetry is broken , and the triggering of electroweak symmetry breaking may be mediated , for example , by gravitational - scale physics , or by gauge interactions at much lower energy scales .",
    "alternatively , @xmath16 may be the scale of a new gauge force , technicolor , which forms fermion condensates that directly break @xmath9 .",
    "finally , new strong gauge forces could bind a composite higgs boson .",
    "recently an alternative framework has been proposed  @xcite in which spacetime is enlarged to contain large extra compact spatial dimensions . at distances smaller than the size of these extra dimensions",
    "the gravitational force varies more rapidly than the inverse square law , so that the fundamental mass scale of gravity can be made much smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "the conventional mass hierarchy of ( [ eq : masshier ] ) is completely avoided if this fundamental mass scale is of order the weak scale . in this case , the length scale of the extra dimensions is much larger than the scales probed experimentally at colliders , and hence this framework requires that the quarks , leptons and gauge quanta of the sm are spatially confined to a @xmath19 dimensional sub - space of the enlarged spacetime .    the physics at the fundamental scale , @xmath0 , which may well be that of string theory , will be directly accessible to colliders of sufficiently high energy ; but even at lower energies this physics may be experimentally probed . at energies below the fundamental mass scale ,",
    "physics is described by an effective lagrangian , which we take to be the most general set of @xmath20 invariant operators involving quark , lepton and higgs doublet fields of the sm : _ eff = _ sm + _",
    "i c_i ^p _ i^4+p [ eq : leff ] where @xmath21 is the sm lagrangian , @xmath22 runs over all gauge invariant operators , @xmath23 , of dimension @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are unknown dimensionless couplings .",
    "in this letter we study consequences of several of the dimension-6 operators .",
    "first we derive bounds on the @xmath27 from existing experimental results under very conservative assumptions about flavor - breaking in the ultraviolet theory .",
    "we then re - examine the precision electroweak bounds on the higgs boson mass .",
    "analyses within the standard model find a light higgs ; however , we will show that such results do not survive the addition of non - renormalizable operators , even if those operators are suppressed by scales as large as @xmath28 . in theories with large extra dimensions there is no good argument for a light higgs over a heavy higgs or a non - linearly realized @xmath29 symmetry , in which case ( [ eq : leff ] ) must be replaced by a chiral lagrangian .",
    "finally we examine two operators in particular and their effects on the discovery of higgs bosons : _ g & = & ^ g^a_g^a [ eq : hop1 ] + _ & = & ^ f_f^ [ eq : hop2 ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the qcd and electromagnetic field strengths , and @xmath7 is the higgs doublet with re@xmath32 .",
    "the first operator contributes to higgs production at hadron colliders via gluon - gluon fusion , and the second to higgs decay to @xmath13 .",
    "there are two reasons why these effects provide a significant discovery potential for extra dimensions : first , they are competing against a sm signal which is suppressed by loop factors , and second , the sm @xmath33 is further suppressed by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "however we assume that the physics at scale @xmath0 which generates ( [ eq : hop1])([eq : hop2 ] ) , does so in a way that the coefficients are not suppressed by powers of the sm gauge coupling constants ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a behavior is certainly _ not _ expected if the theory at @xmath0 is a 4-dimensional gauge field theory : in that case operators of the form ( [ eq : hop1])([eq : hop2 ] ) would arise by integrating out heavy fields , but these fields must couple to @xmath12 and @xmath11 with the usual sm gauge couplings , and further , as shown in @xmath36 , they must be also be loop - suppressed .",
    "thus even if the gauge theory at @xmath0 were strongly - coupled , it seems unlikely that coefficients of @xmath37 could be generated .",
    "this is very important  the effect of the interaction @xmath38 on the @xmath39 branching ratio has been studied , and is small for @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "thus observation of the physics we will describe in section  [ sec : expt ] would provide support for an extra - dimensional theory .",
    "are the coefficients @xmath41 expected to be large enough for an observable @xmath39 signal ? in general this can not be excluded , since physics induced by operators @xmath42 will place bounds on ( f_i=1 ) not on @xmath0 .",
    "however , it would be unreasonable to expect @xmath43 to be orders of magnitude larger than all the other @xmath26 .",
    "it is tempting to assume that although the dimensionless coefficients @xmath26 are unknown , they are all of order unity .",
    "however , in this case operators which violate baryon number constrain @xmath44 , and @xmath45 violating operators contributing to @xmath46 constrain @xmath47 . thus the framework of large compact extra dimensions , allowing a fundamental scale close to the weak scale , is clearly excluded unless the low energy effective theory possesses an approximate flavor symmetry , in which case one expects c_i = _ fi c_i [ eq : cprime ] with @xmath48 of order unity .",
    "the flavor symmetry breaking parameters , @xmath49 , depend on the flavor symmetry group and the pattern of flavor symmetry breaking . for operators which violate flavor and @xmath45 they must be small , while for operators which conserve flavor and @xmath45 they may be set to unity .    to allow low values for @xmath0 ,",
    "the flavor group should be large , and its breaking should be kept to a minimum , consistent with the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings .",
    "the maximum flavor group of the sm is @xmath50 .",
    "the three generations of quarks and leptons transform as @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ; @xmath55 .",
    "if there are only three symmetry breaking parameters , one for each of the up , down and charged lepton mass matrices , @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ; @xmath58 , then baryon number and lepton number remain unbroken .",
    "( the @xmath59 are equal to the yukawa couplings up to an @xmath37 factor , @xmath26 : @xmath60 .",
    ") however , even after imposing such a flavor symmetry , there remain operators such as _ qq = ( |q_l ^_u _ u^q_l)^2 = c_u^4(|q_l^_u_u^q_l)^2 [ eq : oqq ] which contribute to @xmath46 and constrain @xmath61 .",
    "there are two ways to avoid this bound .",
    "first , since the bound depends quadratically on @xmath62 , values slightly larger than 1 will weaken the bound significantly ; this seems entirely natural to us .",
    "second , one could postulate that @xmath63 are real and the observed @xmath46 has an exotic origin ; we view this as disfavored given that measurements of @xmath64 and @xmath65 mixing indicate values of the ckm matrix elements consistent with a standard model origin of @xmath46 to better than @xmath66 .    for the @xmath39 signal ,",
    "we are interested in the operators ( [ eq : hop1])([eq : hop2 ] ) , which conserve @xmath50 .",
    "hence , even if the higher dimension flavor violating operators , such as ( [ eq : oqq ] ) , are completely absent , it is important to study constraints on @xmath0 expected from operators which conserve @xmath50 .",
    "such operators include flavor - conserving four - fermion operators and operators involving the higgs doublet and the gauge fields .",
    "there have been many analyses to date which obtain constraints from these operators , and here we will simply repeat the results of these analyses , in the notation we are using for @xmath0 .",
    "( an analysis similar to ours was recently presented in  @xcite . )    among the @xmath45-conserving four - fermion operators , the strongest constraints come from atomic parity violation .",
    "the operator @xmath67 gives a constraint @xmath68  @xcite at 95% cl .",
    "if the operator @xmath69 were generated with the same coefficient , @xmath70 would be preserved in atomic systems and the previous limit would vanish . although we do not expect @xmath70 to be a good symmetry of the underlying theory , a partial cancellation could easily weaken this bound . apart from @xmath70-violation , the best bounds on @xmath71 currently come from opal  @xcite , using the @xmath72 component , and from cdf  @xcite , using the @xmath73 component .",
    "both find @xmath74 at 95% cl .",
    "the bounds on the coefficients of the operators @xmath75 of ( [ eq : oqq])([eq : olq ] ) do not provide strict bounds on the scale @xmath0 , because @xmath76 , and the @xmath26 are unknown .",
    "nevertheless , if the ( flavor - conserving ) @xmath77 are expected to be of order unity for these operators , then @xmath78 is clearly allowed , while a value of @xmath0 as low as @xmath79 seems disfavored .",
    "a second class of constraints arise from precision measurements in the electroweak gauge sector , namely from the @xmath80 and @xmath81 parameters ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest of these constraints arise from the operators : _ bw&= & b^ ( ^^a w^a ) [ obw ] + _ & = & ( ^d^ ) ( d_^ ) [ op1 ] which contribute s_new & = & -f_bw + t_new & = & -f _ where @xmath82 are the sine and cosine of the weak angle and @xmath83 , @xmath84 are unknown signs .    a global fit to electroweak observables  @xcite yields @xmath85 and @xmath86 assuming @xmath87 .   and defines @xmath88 in the sm .",
    "we rescale to @xmath87 using the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ds])([dt ] ) ) .",
    "we then treat deviations from @xmath87 as `` new physics . ''",
    "] since each operator contributes only to one of @xmath80 or @xmath81 , we can find independent bounds on each .",
    "we find that at 95% cl : _ bw & > & 3.6[bwbound ] + _ & > & 3.0 .",
    "we can also extract a bound if @xmath89 : @xmath90 , allowing the higgs mass to vary over the range @xmath91 .",
    "we see that the constraints from precision electroweak physics are very similar in magnitude to those obtained in the previous section .",
    "how important are these constraints for restricting @xmath92 ?",
    "although the electromagnetic field strength , @xmath93 , is not @xmath94 invariant , the operator @xmath95 is generated , after electroweak symmetry - breaking , from the invariant operators @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 of eq .",
    "( [ obw ] ) : = c_w^2+s_w^2 + c_ws_w .",
    "[ foper ] all @xmath99 and @xmath100 on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ foper ] ) were equal , then the bound ( [ bwbound ] ) on @xmath101 implies @xmath102 .",
    "however , changes in the relative signs or sizes of each contribution significantly reduces the bound ; thus we have no strong lower bound on the scale @xmath92 itself .",
    "likewise we know of no strong constraint on the scale @xmath103 either .    finally we wish to address the question of the higgs mass .",
    "it is well - known that fits to the electroweak data indicate a light higgs .",
    "a simple fit can be done using only @xmath80 and @xmath81 as given above and the following parameterization of the higgs contributions from ref .",
    "@xcite : s_h&=&0.091 x_h - 0.010 x_h^2 [ ds ] + t_h&=&-0.079 x_h-0.028 x_h^2 + 0.0026 x_h^3 [ dt ] where @xmath104 . using these forms ,",
    "one can do a fit demanding @xmath105 and likewise for @xmath81 . for the sm alone , a 95% cl",
    "upper bound of @xmath106 has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "however it is clear that from the point of view of the oblique parameters , shifts in @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be compensated by similar shifts in @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus we can derive an effective `` 95% cl bound '' on the higgs mass as a function of @xmath0 under the requirement that the fit to the experimentally obtained @xmath111 and @xmath112 be no worse than that obtained for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "( we do this by constructing a @xmath115 distribution from @xmath80 and @xmath81 alone . )",
    "how large can the higgs mass become with the inclusion of @xmath98 and @xmath116 ?",
    "the answer is : quite large .",
    "fitting to @xmath117 as a function of @xmath0 and using @xmath80 and @xmath81 as `` experimental '' inputs , we find for particular choices of the signs of the operators ( , @xmath118 ) that _ the precision electroweak bound on the higgs mass disappears completely for @xmath119 ! _",
    "( by `` disappear ''",
    "we mean that the 95% upper bound on @xmath117 exceeds the unitarity bound of approximately @xmath120 and so is meaningless . ) thus , in the context of gravitational physics at or below @xmath121 , the usual claims that electroweak physics prefers a light higgs do not hold . and even for @xmath0 as high as @xmath122 , the upper limit on the higgs mass exceeds @xmath123 .",
    "these results are summarized in figure  [ massfig ] where we show the 95% cl allowed range for @xmath117 as a function of @xmath124 .",
    "the hatched region at small @xmath0 is ruled out because of its large contribution to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while the region at large @xmath0 and large @xmath117 is ruled out because the new operators contribute too little to @xmath80 and @xmath81 to significantly effect the sm fit to the higgs mass .",
    "however for intermediate @xmath0 ( unhatched region ) it is clear that there is effectively no limit on the higgs mass thanks to the effects of the new operators .",
    "= 4truein    ( if the physics at @xmath0 were weakly - coupled then we would expect that @xmath125 ; then allowing @xmath126 would reproduce fig .  [ massfig ] , only with the @xmath0 rescaled by @xmath127 .",
    "thus the preference for a light higgs in the sm is even removed for a weakly - coupled gauge theory if @xmath128 . )    finally , we note that the one other argument for a light higgs , namely triviality , is no longer applicable in these models either . with such a low ultraviolet cutoff ( @xmath129 few tev ) , the higgs self - coupling can not run to its landau pole for @xmath130 .",
    "the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , it is commonly believed that the higgs boson exists , and is light .",
    "the two indirect indications for this are :    * the successful prediction of the weak mixing angle from gauge coupling constant unification .",
    "this prediction results in theories with weak scale supersymmetry which are perturbative to a high scale ; such theories have a light higgs boson , @xmath131  @xcite . *",
    "the experimental values of the precision electroweak observables are consistent with the standard model , at 95% c.l .",
    ", only if @xmath132  @xcite .",
    "if there are large extra dimensions allowing the fundamental scale , @xmath0 , to be in the tev domain , neither of these points can be used to argue that the higgs boson is light . for the first",
    ": it has not been demonstrated that it is possible to predict the weak mixing angle to the percent level of accuracy in these theories ; furthermore , there is no need for the field theory below @xmath0 to be supersymmetric since there is no large hierarchy between the weak scale and @xmath0 .",
    "the argument from fits to the precision electroweak observables applies only if the standard model is the correct theory up to scales of at least 10 tev ; it is a very weak bound which is immediately evaded by large extra dimensions , allowing several scenarios for ewsb :    * _ light higgs _ ( @xmath133 ) : for @xmath134 some protection mechanism for the higgs mass would be required ; if this is supersymmetry , the higgs will be light . for @xmath135 ,",

    "_ heavy higgs _ ( @xmath136 ) : this could arise for @xmath137 tev , if the higgs mass parameter is somewhat less than @xmath0 , or alternatively for @xmath138 if the higgs mass parameter vanishes at tree level but arises at 1 loop . in both cases a large value for the higgs self coupling is needed , and the operators ( [ obw ] ) and ( [ op1 ] ) must mimic the effects of a light higgs in the @xmath80 and @xmath81 parameters . * _ no higgs _ : physics at the fundamental scale @xmath139 may itself cause ewsb .",
    "an example of this has already been proposed @xcite . in this case",
    "the theory below @xmath0 will have @xmath9 realized non - linearly , and the chiral lagrangian will have operators analagous to ( [ obw ] ) and ( [ op1 ] ) which mimic the effects of a light higgs in the @xmath80 and @xmath81 parameters .",
    "a light higgs boson is just one possibility amongst several for ewsb , and is not preferred .",
    "we have shown that , in theories with large extra dimensions having @xmath140 with @xmath141 of order unity , the precision electroweak data provide a lower bound on the fundamental scale , @xmath142 . for values of @xmath0 in the range ( 13)@xmath143 , the signs @xmath144 are critical . for two sign choices , no successful fit can be found for any higgs mass . for a third choice",
    ", a good fit to the data is found for higgs masses all the way up to @xmath145 .",
    "for the final choice , masses up to @xmath120 are also obtained , though the fits are less convincing . only in the case of very large @xmath0",
    "does the data still prefer a light higgs , but then the quadratic finetuning of the light higgs mass to one part in @xmath146 is reintroduced .    in view of the bounds on @xmath147 of @xmath148 from each of @xmath149 ( [ eq : oqq]),@xmath150 ( [ eq : olq ] ) , @xmath98 ( [ obw ] ) , and @xmath116 ( [ op1 ] ) , it may be felt that the exciting possibility of @xmath0 in the @xmath151 range is unlikely .",
    "why would all the relevant @xmath26 coefficients be small ?",
    "one possibility is that the dominant interactions of the new physics at @xmath0 preserve symmetries that are broken by the electroweak gauge interactions , including @xmath70 , @xmath45 and custodial @xmath5 .",
    "if these symmetries are broken by sub - dominant interactions at @xmath0 , then the smallness of the relevant @xmath26 can be naturally explained .",
    "for the case that there is a higgs boson , either light or heavy , we now study the effects of @xmath152 of ( [ eq : hop1])([eq : hop2 ] ) on the signal for @xmath39 at hadron colliders .",
    "these operators have two immediate consequences .",
    "first , when both higgs fields are set to their vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) , the gauge couplings of qed and qcd are shifted .",
    "but these shifts can be reabsorbed into the definition of the gauge couplings and therefore have no observable implications .",
    "( if one attempts to unify the sm gauge couplings at some ultraviolet scale , or otherwise define theoretical relations among them , then these shifts will enter into the relation between the theoretical couplings and those extracted from data . however , for all but the lightest @xmath0 , this shift is smaller than the experimental uncertainties . )    the second consequence is the possibility of unusual production and decay modes of the ( physical ) higgs bosons . taking one of the higgs fields to its vev , one obtains terms in the effective lagrangian : _ eff = + f_hf_f^ + f_g hg^a_g^a + [ eq : hleff ] where @xmath153 is the physical higgs boson , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are unknown signs .",
    "first , @xmath156 can contribute to the gluon fusion process @xmath157 .",
    "it is well - known that the dominant production mode for higgs bosons at the tevatron and the lhc is through gluon fusion , via a loop of @xmath158-quarks .",
    "because the process occurs at one - loop , non - renormalizable operators are more likely to provide a significant correction to the cross - section . integrating out the @xmath158-quark , the relevant low - energy operator is then ( for a recent discussion of the relevant sm higgs physics , see  @xcite ) : _ g , eff=(-i_g+f_g ) hg^a_g^a where @xmath159 is the su(2 ) coupling constant and @xmath160 for @xmath161 @xmath162 . for @xmath163 , the new physics will actually dominate the production of higgs bosons .",
    "note that the cross - section is maximized for constructive interference , @xmath164 , and minimized for @xmath165 .",
    "the operator @xmath95 does not contribute to higgs production could turn the nlc into an @xmath166-channel higgs factory when run in @xmath167 mode . ] .",
    "however it can contribute to the decay of the higgs into photons : ( h)= for @xmath168 . in the sm , this process is dominated by loops of @xmath169-bosons and @xmath158-quarks . integrating them out yields an effective operator : _",
    ", eff=(-i_+ f _ ) hf_f^ where @xmath170 varies from roughly @xmath171 to @xmath172 as @xmath117 is varied . once again",
    ", the new physics will dominate the width for @xmath173 given @xmath174 . if @xmath175 , its decay width is dominated by final state @xmath176-quarks",
    "; then @xmath173 becomes the dominant decay mode given @xmath177 .",
    "however , even for larger @xmath92 , the branching ratio @xmath173 may be more than sufficient to provide a strong signal .",
    "the signal is maximized for @xmath178 ( , constructive interference of the sm and new physics ) and minimized for @xmath179 .",
    "( in the context of lep , ref .",
    "@xcite recently examined the effect of @xmath95 and related operators on @xmath180 and found sensitivity there to new physics roughly below a scale @xmath181 . )    unfortunately , the operator @xmath156 can also contribute to the higgs decay width via @xmath182 which is unobservable among the qcd backgrounds .",
    "in fact , to lowest order , ( hgg)=8()^4 ( h ) . in the limit in which the new physics is dominating the higgs decays and @xmath183 , the @xmath182 decays suppress the branching ratio into @xmath173 by about a factor of 10 .",
    "however , once final state @xmath184 dominate the higgs width , the decays to gluons provide no real additional suppression of the @xmath173 branching fraction .",
    "finally we note that the interference of @xmath156 with the sm gives simultaneously larger ( smaller ) higgs cross - sections and larger ( smaller ) @xmath185 .",
    "the sensitivity of any experiment to new physics in the higgs channel is then a function of several variables : @xmath117 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath92 and @xmath103 .",

    "the maximum signal case has @xmath178 and @xmath164 ; we checked that over the entire range of interest the increase in the cross - section implied by @xmath164 more than offset the corresponding increase in @xmath189 .",

    "it has been found that nlo qcd corrections can change the cross - sections and decay widths by @xmath191  @xcite .",
    "naively such changes appear to correspond only to @xmath192 shifts in @xmath0 , which are too small for the physics we are interested in here .",
    "however , it is possible that interference effects and enhanced backgrounds ( , @xmath173 in the sm ) could produce a larger effect  we will not consider that possibility here .    throughout our analysis",
    "we also have to address issues of acceptances and backgrounds in an approximate manner . in run",
    "i , cdf reported an efficiency times acceptance approaching 15% in inclusive @xmath193 higgs searches  @xcite ; we will assume that this figure prevails at all future facilities .",
    "there are also two major sources of backgrounds for our @xmath167 signal : sm processes which produce or fake @xmath167 , and the usual sm decay of @xmath173 itself .",
    "the latter can be calculated explicitly .",
    "for the former we estimate by fitting to the cdf background spectrum  @xcite , appropriately scaled to the luminosity of future tevatron runs , or the atlas background spectrum  @xcite appropriately scaled for lhc runs .    in figures  [ fig1](a)-(b )",
    "we show the sensitivity to @xmath92 that can be obtained at various machines by plotting their @xmath194 discovery reaches ( with no @xmath156 contribution ) .",
    "the colliders shown are : the tevatron with @xmath195 and @xmath196 of luminosity ( run i ) , with @xmath197 and @xmath198 of luminosity ( run ii ) , with @xmath197 and @xmath199 ( a proposed run iii ) , and the lhc with @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( initial luminosity ) and @xmath202 ( final luminosity ) respectively .",
    "( note that the tev run i line falls below the region of parameter space plotted . ) as one expects , once the @xmath203 threshold opens up at @xmath204 , the large @xmath205 is sufficient to overwhelm the photonic width and our experimental sensitivity drops significantly .",
    "nonetheless , given the possibility of a light higgs ( and the robust arguments for one in supersymmetric frameworks ) experimentalists should be encouraged to view @xmath173 as a viable and potentially large signal .",
    "= 6truein    in terms of extracting a conservative discovery reach for @xmath0 , figure  [ fig1](b ) should be used since it chooses @xmath186 in order to minimize the signal .",

    "@xmath207 for a light higgs .",
    "however it is important to realize that for generic @xmath186 , the various colliders may have reaches as high as those shown in figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "thus , for example , if the higgs mass is below the @xmath208 threshold , the lhc can possibly find a signal for @xmath0 up to @xmath209 for a light higgs !",

    "we again show the same set of 5 collider options .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) is the conservative @xmath194 discovery reach , chosen to minimize the @xmath212 rate .",
    "it is interesting that for a light higgs , the limits are slightly stronger than those obtained with @xmath190 ; now even the tevatron run i data has the ability to probe scales above @xmath206 .",
    "however the more noticable difference is the ability to produce larger numbers of heavy higgs bosons and observe their @xmath167 decays .",
    "for example , the lhc is capable of probing scales near @xmath213 even for @xmath214 .",
    "= 6truein    figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the maximal reach of the various colliders , with the lhc now extending its sensitivity to @xmath0 as high as @xmath121 for a light higgs ! finally , we summarize a few of our results for @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath123 for both exclusion and discovery in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "all bounds assume @xmath217 . for each choice of the higgs mass ,",
    "we have shown a conservative limit on @xmath0 which can be excluded , and a maximum @xmath0 below which a signal may be discovered .",
    "thus for the exclusion bounds ( @xmath218 ) we have taken the interference effects to minimize the signal ; for the maximum discovery reaches ( @xmath194 ) , we have chosen the interference effects to maximize the signal .    .exclusion limits and maximum discovery reaches ( in tev ) for various collider runs for 3 representative higgs masses . the first column for each",
    "@xmath117 is a conservative @xmath218 exclusion reach for each machine ; the second column is the optimistic @xmath194 discovery reach .",
    "unfilled columns represent limits below @xmath206 .",
    "we take @xmath219 for the table . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    we have attempted in this analysis to be rather conservative . for one thing , the @xmath218 exclusion limits of the various colliders are often several tev higher than the @xmath194 discovery limits .",
    "secondly , we have treated the discovery of the @xmath173 signal as simply a counting experiment , throwing away useful experimental information , for example on the shape of the diphoton mass spectrum , which would be available experimentally to help extract the signal from the backgrounds .",
    "lastly , we have not included qcd corrections to the amplitudes , which we believe could increase the signal ( though also increasing the `` background '' @xmath173 signal ) by @xmath220 .",
    "therefore we believe that the reaches given here are to be taken as conservative values , insofar as one should take the scales deduced from naive power - counting seriously .",
    "in this paper we have studied two consequences of large extra dimensions for electroweak symmetry breaking : a relaxation of the precision electroweak bound on the higgs boson mass , and an enhanced rate for @xmath13 events at hadron colliders from higgs decay .",
    "the relaxation of the precision electroweak bound on the higgs mass applies when any new physics generates ( [ obw ] ) and ( [ op1 ] ) at a scale of several tev .",
    "it is well known that @xmath80 and @xmath81 depend only logarithmically on the higgs boson mass , but it may not be appreciated that the mass bound can be evaded completely for a wide range of values of @xmath0 , extending as high as 10 tev . for example ,",
    "even a weakened bound of @xmath221 , only applies if the standard model is the correct description of nature up to energies of @xmath122 .",
    "we find this implausible , since it implies a fine tuning in the higgs mass squared parameter of 1 part in 2000 .",
    "there is only one strong argument for a light higgs boson : the correct successful prediction of the weak mixing angle at the percent level of accuracy requires weak scale supersymmetry , and therefore a light higgs boson . in theories with large extra dimensions this argument is not applicable , since the percent level prediction for the weak mixing angle is lost .",
    "hence , in these theories , there is no preference for a light higgs boson , and thus alternatives with a heavy higgs or no higgs should be considered seriously .",
    "if there is a higgs boson , we have shown that a generic signal of large extra dimensions is an anomalously large @xmath167 signal at machines capable of producing higgs bosons .",
    "expectations from the sm put such a signal out of reach of the tevatron . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we showed the @xmath222 discovery reaches for @xmath223 at the tevatron and lhc . at run ii of the tevatron collider this signal would be discovered for a light higgs if @xmath0 is less than 2 ( 3 ) tev for destructive ( constructive ) interference .",
    "lhc not only increases the discovery potential for a light higgs boson mass , up to @xmath121 for constructive interference , but also has significant discovery potential up to the largest higgs masses .",
    "this signal compares favorably with that of graviton production at colliders @xcite , especially if the scale which sets the size of the @xmath224 dimensional gravitational coupling is somewhat larger than the scale @xmath0 .",
    "we are grateful to nima arkani - hamed , michael chanowitz , savas dimopoulos and henry frisch for many useful conversations .",
