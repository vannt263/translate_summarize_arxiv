    "present observations of the cmb anisotropies by the boomerang @xcite , maxima-1 @xcite , cbi @xcite and dasi @xcite experiments combined with the data from the supernova project ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that although the geometry of the universe is flat , its matter content is dominated by the vacuum energy or so - called quintessence . the background cosmology has a very strong influence on the structure formation . in this paper",
    "we address the formation of first bound objects in the flat @xmath8cdm cosmology .",
    "the structure formation on both large and small scales has been studied very carefully in the dark matter dominated cosmology , in particular in the flat pure cdm model .",
    "this is not so for the vacuum - energy - dominated models , which are of prime relevance according to the above observations .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting objects to study are the first bound objects in the universe ",
    "the first quasars and the population iii stars that were the first sources of photons after the light of cmb faded away , and ended the ` dark ages ' of the universe . some of these calculations were described in a review by @xcite .",
    "the recent identification of quasars at @xmath9 in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite strongly motivates such an investigation .",
    "our code is similar to the one by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "we consider the evolution of a single spherically symmetric density perturbation in the early universe starting soon after recombination until it finally forms a bound stationary object .",
    "our aim here is to extend their analysis , which was restricted to the @xmath6 cdm cosmology , to the @xmath8-dominated universe and compare the results with those for the flat , dark matter dominated universe but with more up - to - date cosmological parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "we start tracing the initial expansion of the perturbation at high redshift when its density contrast is still in the linear regime .",
    "then we follow decoupling of the perturbation from the hubble flow and its subsequent collapse and formation of a virialized cloud .",
    "we include the gas dynamics and various cooling and heating processes operating in the expanding and collapsing cloud .",
    "the chemical evolution of the collapsing primordial gas cloud is also accounted for .",
    "after the initial collapse , a virialized gas cloud is formed .",
    "the kinetic energy of the infalling gas is dissipated through shocks and the cloud becomes pressure - supported .",
    "we study the further evolution of the cloud which is determined by its ability to cool sufficiently fast .",
    "the most important cooling mechanism for low - mass clouds is the radiation of excited h@xmath10 molecules .",
    "the presence of a small amount of the molecular hydrogen h@xmath10 is crucial for triggering the final collapse of such clouds which could form the first luminous object in the universe .",
    "a major approximation we use is the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "this assumption is best justified in the case of first objects formed in the universe which are supposed to originate from the rare highest fluctuations in the primordial density field @xcite .",
    "it allows us to focus mainly on gas dynamical processes which are expected to control the collapse of low - mass clouds which are supposed to form the first luminous objects .",
    "the spectrum of density fluctuations has more power on small scales , hence the first nonlinear structures are expected to occur on relatively small scales @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in small scales , much lower than the horizon , we use newtonian gravity and treat the expansion of the universe as a hydrodynamical flow . to describe the evolution of a spherically symmetric density perturbation in the nonlinear regime we use lagrangian coordinates .",
    "we divide both baryonic and dark matter into concentric shells .",
    "the dynamics of primordial matter is given by the equations below .",
    "the continuity equation for baryonic matter reads    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the radius of a sphere of mass @xmath13 .",
    "the radial velocity of the surface of this sphere is    @xmath14    and the acceleration satisfies the dynamical equation    @xmath15    where @xmath16 ) is the total mass within radius @xmath12 including the effects of radiation and vacuum energy components of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "two last contributions result from the cmb and cosmological constant components of the energy density of the universe ,    @xmath17    and    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the present contribution of the cmb to the total energy density of the universe in terms of the critical density .",
    "although , as we have shown in @xcite , at least the radiation component is not negligible , both dark energy and radiation terms are not very important .",
    "the energy conservation condition for baryonic matter reads    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath22 is the pressure and @xmath23 is the baryon density .",
    "the last term in the eq.([energia ] ) describes cooling / heating of the gas , with @xmath24 being the energy emission ( absorption ) rate per unit volume .",
    "we use the equation of state of the ideal gas    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , as the primordial baryonic matter after recombination is assumed to be composed of monoatomic hydrogen and helium with a small ( but very important ) admixture of molecular hydrogen h@xmath10 .",
    "dynamics of dark matter is simpler , as we assume it to be collisionless .",
    "the continuity equation is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the radius of dark matter sphere of mass @xmath29 .",
    "the radial velocity of this sphere is    @xmath30    and the acceleration reads    @xmath31    to solve the above equations we must specify the cooling / heating function @xmath24 and the the initial conditions .",
    "let us begin with the initial conditions . we start to follow the evolution of the perturbation soon after the recombination at a sufficiently high redshift that the perturbation is still in the linear regime .",
    "we choose the initial redshift to be @xmath32 like in @xcite .",
    "we apply the initial density profiles in the form of a single spherical fourier mode used also by @xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the actual value of the hubble parameter .",
    "the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 measure , respectively , the baryon and dark matter density enhancement with respect to the mean densities @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    for this profile there exist two distinguished values of the radius , @xmath42 and @xmath43 which correspond , respectively , to the first zero and the first minimum of the function @xmath44 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ rozklsin ] .    inside the sphere of radius @xmath45 which contains mass @xmath46 ,",
    "the local density contrast is positive .",
    "the mass @xmath46 and the radius @xmath42 will be referred to as the cloud mass and the cloud radius , respectively .",
    "the local density contrast is negative for @xmath47 , with the average density contrast vanishing for the sphere of radius @xmath48 with the mass @xmath49 . according to the gravitational instability theory in the expanding universe ,",
    "the shell of radius @xmath43 will expand together with the hubble flow not suffering any additional deceleration .",
    "this is why we regard this profile as very convenient in numerical simulations because it eliminates numerical edge effects and mentioned shell simply follows the hubble expansion of the universe .",
    "it can thus be regarded as the boundary of the perturbation and the mass @xmath49 will be referred to as the bound mass .",
    "it is worth to note that for radii not greater than @xmath50 this profile is very similar to the gaussian profile    @xmath51\\ ] ]    with @xmath52 .",
    "both profiles are compared in fig .",
    "[ rozklady ] .    as the initial velocity we use the hubble velocity for baryon matter ,    @xmath53    whereas for dark matter",
    "the initial velocity is @xcite    @xmath54    the expression in brackets indicates averaging over the sphere of radius r. slower expansion of dark matter at @xmath32 results from the fact that the dark matter perturbations start to grow earlier than do the baryon matter ones .    finally , the amplitudes of baryon and dark matter perturbations , @xmath38 and @xmath39 should be specified .",
    "to do so one should use the power spectrum corresponding to the initial redshift @xmath32 that provides rms density fluctuations at a given mass @xmath46 . for cold dark matter model we use transfer functions calculated using the cmbfast program by @xcite .",
    "the actual value of the rms density fluctuation is equal to    @xmath55    where @xmath56 .",
    "the value of normalization constant @xmath57 may be also obtained from the cmbfast program .",
    "the rms fluctuation @xmath58 depends on the shape of the window over which the density is averaged . however , this dependence is quite weak . in the table [ sigma ]",
    "we list some values for @xmath59 obtained by applying this formula to the transfer function and cobe - normalized normalization obtained from cmbfast to the gaussian profile of filter radius @xmath52 . instead of @xmath60 , we use m@xmath61 which is equal to the total baryonic mass within a sphere of the radius r@xmath61 .",
    ".rms overdensities for @xmath8cdm and flat cdm . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sigma ]    it is worth to note that these results are not much different from the results obtained by applying the fit by @xcite .",
    "however , our results are systematically greater by about 23 - 24% for the @xmath8-dominated model and by about 7 - 10% for the pure cdm model .",
    "probably it is due to the fact that the mentioned fit is less accurate for larger redshifts ( especially for @xmath62 ) and greater @xmath63 ratios .",
    "as the baryon density perturbations start to grow only after the recombination , we have decided to set its initial value to @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "let us note that cmbfast predicts @xmath65 to be about @xmath66 in both @xmath8 and dark matter dominated models .",
    "however , as we have shown in @xcite , if @xmath67 is 0.2 or less the results are pretty much insensitive to this ratio , runs with its values equal to 0.2 , 0.1 and 0.0 were almost indistinguishible .",
    "to specify the cooling / heating function @xmath24 in eq.([energia ] ) one should include all relevant thermal and chemical processes in the primordial gas .",
    "there are many papers discussing the most important contributions to the function @xmath24  see e.g. @xcite .",
    "all formulas may be found in @xcite .",
    "the primordial gas consists of neutral atoms and molecules , ions and free electrons . in this paper",
    "we have taken into account nine species : h , h@xmath68 , h@xmath69 , he , he@xmath69 , he@xmath70 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath71 and e@xmath68 .",
    "some authors ( e.g. @xcite ) include also deuterium and lithium .",
    "the abundance of various species can , generally , change with time as the chemical reactions between species occur and the ionization and dissociation photoprocesses take place in the hot gas .",
    "the chemical reactions include such processes as e.g. the ionization of hydrogen and helium by electrons , the recombination of ions with electrons , the formation of negative hydrogen ions , the formation of h@xmath10 molecules , etc .",
    "the full list of relevant chemical reactions is given in @xcite .",
    "photoprocesses include ionization of neutral hydrogen h , helium he and he@xmath69 by photons , and dissociation of negative hydrogen ions h@xmath68 and h@xmath10 molecules by photons .",
    "time evolution of the number density of the component @xmath72 is described by the kinetic equation :    @xmath73    the first component on the right - hand side of this equation describes the chemical reactions and the other one describes photoionization and photodissociation processes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 are reaction rates , the quantities @xmath75 are photoionization or photodissociation rates and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are numbers equal to 0 , @xmath78 or @xmath79 depending on the reaction .",
    "all the reaction rates , photoionization and photodissociation rates are given in @xcite .",
    "the cooling ( heating ) function @xmath24 includes emissivities ( absorption rates ) due to such processes as the collisional ionization of h , he and he@xmath69 , recombination to h , he and he@xmath69 , the collisional excitation of h and he@xmath69 , bremsstrahlung , the compton cooling and the cooling by deexcitation of h@xmath10 molecules . the formulae for the heating / cooling contributions of various processes are given in @xcite .",
    "the dynamical equations ( [ ciaglosc])-([predkoscd ] ) are solved numerically . at each timestep also the chemical composition of the gas is updated by solving eq.([chemia ] ) and the appropriate value of the cooling function @xmath24 is calculated .",
    "we based our numerical code on the code described by @xcite , which is the standard , second - order accurate , lagrangian finite - difference scheme .",
    "details of the code are described in @xcite .",
    "we handle timesteps and central boundary conditions in the way proposed by thoul and weinberg @xcite . for dark matter",
    ", we treat the center as a hard sphere of some `` small '' radius @xmath80 . in order not to affect the results of calculations",
    "the value of @xmath80 should be much less than any other characteristic radius in the problem but it should not be too small because smaller @xmath80 means worse energy conservation and longer computation time .",
    "we have chosen @xmath80 equal to the initial radius of the most innermost dark matter shell .",
    "for the baryonic component , if a shell falls below @xmath80 we assume that it has ` collapsed ' and fix its radius , temperature and chemical composition .    in the collapse of baryon",
    "matter one encounters the formation of shocks . in our code shocks are treated with the artificial viscosity technique @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that set of equations [ chemia ] is very stiff and may require very small timesteps . to deal with this problem we follow @xcite and we used the stifbs routine from @xcite .",
    "we have performed two sets of calculations , for the @xmath8-dominated universe ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and for the pure cdm model ( @xmath1 , @xmath81 ) , with @xmath4 in both cases .",
    "we started our calculations at @xmath59 .",
    "the initial gas temperature and chemical composition were obtained by running our own program that starts at @xmath82 with equilibrium values and ends at a required redshift .",
    "we have compared its predictions to the results of @xcite and the differences were not greater than 10% .",
    "one should note note that these authors have included more species ( e.g. deuterium and lithium ) and some of their reaction rates were slightly different .",
    "the difference between the temperatures of the baryonic gas and the cbr turned out to be lower than 1% at @xmath59 .",
    "for the @xmath8-dominated model we have performed runs with cloud masses m@xmath61 from 2000 to 10@xmath83 m@xmath84 , for the pure cdm model cloud masses were between 500 and 5000 m@xmath84 . for each cloud mass",
    "we have chosen a few values of the initial dark matter overdensity between 0.07 and 0.40 , depending on the mass .",
    "we have divided the baryonic component to 200 concentric shells of equal mass , the dark matter component was divided to 1000 equal mass shells .",
    "it turned out to be enough  in fig .",
    "[ pordokl ] we compare the calculated amount of virialized and collapsed mass for the same initial conditions and three different runs : with 200 baryonic and 1000 dark matter shells , 200 baryonic and 2000 dark matter shells and , finally , with 400 baryonic and 2000 dark matter shells .",
    "the results are the same within our numerical accuracy .",
    "we expect that there will be a significant difference between the low - mass structure formation in the @xmath8cdm and the standard cdm models .",
    "the main reason is that the rms fluctuations in the dark energy dominated model are about 2.5 - 2.7 times lower than in the standard cdm model ( table [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the other one is that in the standard cdm the average matter density is equal to the critical density so any overdensity would eventually stop its expansion and collapse . in the @xmath8cdm the matter density is lower ,",
    "so there is some threshold overdensity necessary for recollapse .",
    "any given overdensity would collapse slower ( if at all ) than in standard cdm .",
    "it means that in the @xmath8-dominated universe there would be much less luminous objects at large redshifts and the first ones would appear much later as compared to the dark matter dominated universe .",
    "in addition , we may expect that the masses of the first collapsed objects would be greater .",
    "the behaviour of dark matter shells plays the crucial role in the cloud collapse as there is much more dark matter than the baryonic matter . by assumption , dark matter is collisionless , so there is no energy loss mechanism apart from possible gravitational energy exchange .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter shells in the absence of baryonic matter is that their radii increase to some maximal value , then the shells collapse and after some oscillations due to bounces off the artificial hard sphere the dark matter cloud becomes stationary . in the presence of baryonic matter",
    "the behaviour of dark matter shells is similar because the amount of baryonic matter is much lower than the amount of dark matter .",
    "the difference is that the average radius of a dark matter shell slowly decreases .",
    "the behaviour of baryon matter shells is that after reaching maximum radii , the shells collapse and the shock develops at some stage due to pressure crowding of neighbouring shells @xcite .",
    "the shock stops the collapse and the baryon shells virialize .",
    "then if the clouds have a sufficient temperature and density for efficient cooling , they can undergo the final collapse .",
    "we assume that the shell has ` virialized ' if the mean density inside the shell exceeds @xmath85 times the actual mean baryon density of the universe .",
    "this value was calculated for the top - hat overdensities in the einstein - de sitter model but , however , @xcite have shown that in the @xmath8cdm models the dependence on @xmath86 is not very strong . of course , this criterion depends on the redshift . for a virialized baryonic shell",
    "its radius and density are roughly constant but the mean matter density of the universe decreases so the overdensity increases .",
    "this means that overdensity is not a good criterion of the collapse  we need to take something related to the actual size of the object .",
    "we have decided to assume that a shell has ` collapsed ' if its radius falls below some ` small ' value , in our case : the initial radius of the cloud @xmath42 .",
    "the results of our calculations are displayed in figs .",
    "[ lambdacdm ]  [ txew ]",
    ". perhaps the most interesting are plots that show the evolution of the amount of the collapsed baryonic mass for various cloud masses and initial overdensities . figs .",
    "[ lambdacdm ] a - d show the fraction of the cloud mass that meets the collapse criterion at a given redshift for the @xmath8-dominated universe .",
    "similar plots for the dark matter dominated universe are shown in figs .",
    "[ scdm ] a - d .",
    "if there is a line that is described but can not be found on a plot it means that for this overdensity no baryonic shell has collapsed before @xmath5 .",
    "the results confirmed our expectations . in the dark energy",
    "dominated universe initial clouds need greater mass and larger initial overdensities in order to at least partially collapse before @xmath5 . if we restrict ourselves to clouds of @xmath59 dm overdensities not greater than 0.4 , the minimal mass needed for at least partial collapse before @xmath5 is 3000  m@xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ lambdacdm ] b ) . for @xmath87 and @xmath88 the fraction of the collapsed mass is on order two percent ( fig . [ lambdacdm ] a ) .",
    "one should remember that for these cloud masses the rms fluctuations at @xmath59 are about 0.05 so overdensities equal to 0.4 represent @xmath89 peaks , which are * extremely unlikely*. for the dark matter dominated universe , the minimal cloud mass is about 500 m@xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ scdm ] a )  for the initial overdensity equal to 0.4 ( the rms overdensity is about 0.14 ) about 9% of the cloud mass may collapse before @xmath5 .",
    "if we look at higher masses , the collapse becomes easier and easier , threshold initial overdensities for partial collapse before @xmath5 fall much faster than the rms overdensities .",
    "however , for the @xmath8-dominated universe and cloud masses not greater than 10@xmath90 m@xmath84 the clouds need overdensities larger than @xmath91 in order to at least partially collapse  unlike in the flat cdm model . for greater baryonic masses",
    "the collapse is a bit more likely but even for 10@xmath83 m@xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ lambdacdm ] d ) they need at least 2 @xmath92 to start their collapse before @xmath5 .    fig .",

    "the values of initial dark matter density enhancements are , respectively , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the shells shown on the plots enclose @xmath98 , @xmath99 of the bound mass .",
    "this fractional division of mass applies to both dark matter and baryon matter shells .",
    "it applies also to the fig .",
    "[ txew ] ( plots a and b ) that show thermal evolution of gas shells .",
    "the behaviour of both baryonic and dark components is quite typical , very similar to the results of @xcite and our previous work @xcite .",
    "dark matter shells expand to some maximum radius , then recollapse to about a half of this value and then very slowly contract . in our calculations",
    "the behaviour of dark matter is quite independent of the cloud mass  however , the position and the value of the maximal radius depend on the initial overdensity .",
    "in contrast , the behaviour of baryon matter shells strongly depends on the cloud mass and initial overdensity .",
    "of course , higher masses and overdensities cause faster and more violent final collapse .    in figs .",
    "[ txew ] a and b we show the temperature of shells as a function of redshift .",
    "the curves indicating temperatures of baryonic shells behave in an opposite way than the radii of baryonic shells .",
    "the temperature falls during expansion and increases in the collapse phase .",
    "after virialization the temperature remains roughly constant until it starts to fall quite rapidly during the final collapse .",
    "these figures show that virial temperatures in standard cdm are higher than in @xmath8cdm for objects of the same mass : even though for the @xmath8cdm cloud initial overdensity was higher ( 0.3 compared with 0.2 ) , virial temperatures of its shells were about two times smaller .",
    "we also have noticed that in both cosmological models shells that undego the final collapse must reach some critical temperature .",
    "for @xmath8cdm it is about 500 k while for standard cdm it is about 450 k and it is quite independent on the mass of the cloud .",
    "shells at lower temperatures do not collapse before @xmath5 .",
    "the abundance ( by mass ) of various species as a function of redshift is shown in figs .",
    "[ txew ] c and d. the results correspond to the shell of mass @xmath100 of the same cloud as in figs .",
    "[ rew ] and [ txew ] a , b. one can notice the increase of the amount of h@xmath10 molecules at later redshift when the shell collapses .",
    "this makes h@xmath10 cooling more efficient , triggering the final collapse of inner shells .    in figs .",

    "while plots with no cooling / heating ( e and f ) and no h@xmath10 cooling ( c and d ) are almost self - similar for different shells ( the difference in final radii is probably due to different mean initial overdensity for each shell ) and similar to those predicted by bertschinger @xcite , plots with cooling are self - similar and bertschinger - like up to virialization only .",
    "it also shows that h@xmath10 cooling is necessary to collapse before @xmath5 .",
    "for the dark energy dominated universe we need very large overdensities , usually much exceeding the 3@xmath92 limit , for low - mass ( @xmath103 ) objects in order to at least partially collapse before @xmath5 . for the flat , dark matter dominated universe",
    "the collapse is much faster and direct formation of a low - mass object is quite likely , even as soon as for @xmath104 .",
    "it is a result of much lower normalization in @xmath8cdm ( table 1 ) and lower virial temperatures for @xmath8cdm clouds of the same mass and initial overdensity .",
    "a secondary reason may be that in the flat cdm model any overdensity will stop its evolution and possibly cool and collapse while for @xmath105 there is some threshold overdensity that depends on the model and epoch .",
    "the chemical evolution is pretty much insensitive to cosmology , at least before the final collapse . in the @xmath8-dominated universe",
