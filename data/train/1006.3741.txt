    "we consider a quantum system initially defined within a finite space interval @xmath0 ( for clarity , we use notations appropriate for a model defined on the continuum , such as the lieb - liniger model @xcite ; our reasoning also applies to lattice models such as spin chains by trivial modifications ) .",
    "we suppose that the initial hamiltonian can be written as the integral of a hamiltonian density @xmath1 and that specific boundary conditions ( _ e.g. _ periodic or twisted ; the reasoning for the open case is slightly different , and is discussed in the next section ) labeled by @xmath2 are imposed on the wavefunctions . in the case of integrable systems , a complete set of orthonormalizable eigenfunctions",
    "is explicitly given in each @xmath3-particle sector by a bethe ansatz ; individual wavefunctions @xmath4 are labeled by their cardinality-@xmath3 set @xmath5 of rapidities , solution to the bethe equations associated to quantization in the space @xmath0 under boundary conditions @xmath2 .",
    "completeness ensures that the number of allowable solutions coincides with the dimensionality of the hilbert space .",
    "one important observation , reflected in our notation , is that the eigenfunctions @xmath6 do not explicitly depend on the length @xmath7 or boundary conditions @xmath2 ; rather , these dependencies are carried only implicitly by the sets of rapidities .",
    "this simple observation forms the basis of what we propose here .",
    "the generic experiment we have in mind can be described as follows .",
    "suppose that we initially prepare the system in a specific eigenstate @xmath8 . at time @xmath9",
    ", we glue a new , empty region onto the original system , thereby changing its size from @xmath7 to @xmath10 , a process we call a geometric quench . from this point",
    "onwards , to control the subsequent time evolution exactly , all calculations must be done in the basis of eigenstates of the new hamiltonian @xmath11 defined by integrating the same hamiltonian density as before ( so all interaction parameters remain unchanged ) over the larger space interval up to @xmath12 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath13 ( choosing boundary conditions labeled by @xmath14 ) are functions of the form @xmath15 where the sets of rapidities @xmath16 now solve the bethe equations associated to quantization in the space @xmath17 under boundary conditions @xmath14 .    at first sight , the gluing of the wavefunctions before and after the geometric quench is not simple .",
    "this gluing condition can be written as the nonlinear condition @xmath18 decomposing this into the basis of eigenstates of @xmath13 can now be achieved by relying on the crucial observation made above , namely that the wavefunctions of @xmath19 ( respectively @xmath13 ) do not depend explicitly on @xmath20 ( respectively @xmath21 ) .",
    "this allows us to make the identifications @xmath22 in other words , in the region of space where the initial wavefunction is nonvanishing , we can exactly match the functional form of bethe wavefunctions of @xmath13 when restricted to the evaluation domain @xmath23 , to the wavefunctions of @xmath19 but this time evaluated using the rapidities of the @xmath24 state .",
    "the overlap of the initial state with a given eigenfunction of @xmath13 is thus given by the well - known slavnov formula @xcite ( associated to the original domain ) , @xmath25 the exact decomposition of our initial state onto the wavefunctions of @xmath13 is simply written as @xmath26 the subsequent time evolution is now trivial to build back in , since @xmath24 are exact eigenstates of @xmath13 .",
    "this simple expression is the central result of our paper .",
    "from the previous analysis we clearly see that the the dynamics of the geometric quench problem is encoded in the overlaps @xmath27 defined by .",
    "the natural framework for computing norms and overlaps of bethe eigenstates is the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "this approach is based on the construction of a monodromy matrix @xmath28 , which leads to an algebraic formulation of the problem , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the monodromy matrix , @xmath29 with @xmath30 an auxiliary space and @xmath31 the hilbert space , should satisfy the intertwining relation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34matrix satisfying the yang - baxter equation .",
    "one can define the transfer matrix as @xmath35 , where the trace is taken over the auxiliary space .",
    "the transfer matrix now acts as a generating function for a set of mutually commuting conserved charges , including the hamiltonian . for simplicity",
    "we focus in this discussion on xxz - type models ( which includes the lieb - liniger gas ) given by an @xmath36-matrix of the form @xmath37 for this type of @xmath36-matrix the monodromy matrix @xmath28 is a @xmath38 matrix in auxiliary space , @xmath39 the commutation relations of the operators @xmath40 follow from . using these operators , eigenstates of the transfer matrix ( and thus of the hamiltonian ) can be constructed as @xmath41 were the rapidities @xmath42 should satisfy the bethe equations .",
    "the pseudovacuum @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) has the following properties : @xmath45 the form of the vacuum eigenvalues @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on the specific representation of the @xmath36-matrix .    in order to describe the geometric quench we decompose the hilbert space into two spatial intervals : one of length @xmath7 and one of length @xmath48 ( the part that is added ) : @xmath49 .",
    "the operators before the quench act on @xmath50 , while the operators after the quench act on @xmath31 . to be able to make a connection between the two we consider the generalized two - site model introduced in @xcite , namely the monodromy matrix @xmath28 of any algebraic bethe ansatz solvable model can be written as a matrix product of two factors @xmath51 with @xmath52 . from the decomposition of the monodromoy matrix follows that @xmath53 and similar expressions for the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 operators .",
    "we can write the initial @xmath3-particle state ( at @xmath57 ) as @xmath58 while eigenstates in @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath59 act on @xmath60 and will therefore not contribute to the decomposition of the initial state .",
    "the overlaps then become @xmath61 the scalar product @xmath62 is of a special type namely , the state @xmath63 is an eigenstate while @xmath64 is not .",
    "this type of scalar product can be represented efficiently as a determinant @xcite . to obtain the normalized quench overlap @xmath27",
    "as given in one should divide by the norms of the states @xcite before and after the quench . the quench overlap is now defined up to a momentum dependent phase , which is related to the representation of the @xmath36-matrix .",
    "so far we considered periodic boundary conditions , however we can easily generalize this by considering twisted boundary conditions . in this case the scalar product is given in @xcite . since the twist of the state after the quench does not appear explicitly , one has the freedom to chose the twists before and after the quench independently .",
    "the geometric quench setup has a natural generalization to the perhaps more physical case of open boundary conditions .    for an integrable system with open boundary conditions one should define the boundary conditions in terms of matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for xxz - like",
    "models the diagonal solution of the boundary yang - baxter equation @xcite is given by @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 describing the left and right boundaries respectively .",
    "each is parametrized by @xmath70 .",
    "following @xcite we introduce ` double - row ' monodromy matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denotes matrix transposition in the auxiliary space .",
    "the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 are called the boundary operators in contrast with @xmath79 and @xmath56 which are called the bulk operators .",
    "eigenstates can be constructed using boundary operators @xmath80 the action of boundary operators on the vacuum is similar to that of the bulk operators , expect for different vacuum eigenvalues .",
    "we now consider a geometric quench where we keep the left boundary fixed and move the right boundary from @xmath7 to @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to write everything in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath82 operators .",
    "equivalently we could fix the right boundary and write everything in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions we factorize the monodromy matrix as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the double - row monodromy of the smaller system with the same left boundary .",
    "we can now decompose the @xmath87 operator as a combination of bulk and boundary operators : @xmath88 we write the initial state as @xmath89 and we write the final state as @xmath90 the terms without overlap are terms with no @xmath91 operator acting on @xmath60 and will not contribute when taking the scalar product with .",
    "this results in the geometric quench overlap : @xmath92 for the xxz spin chain , the determinant representation for the scalar product @xmath93 is computed in @xcite and is related to the overlap @xmath27 of by a normalization prefactor @xcite . since does not depend on the right boundary condition , we can not only expand the system but also change the right boundary condition after the quench .",
    "we have shown how a sudden , global change in the geometrical support of an integrable model could be completely described within bethe ansatz , by providing an exact decomposition of the original ( arbitrarily chosen ) eigenstate into the basis of eigenstates after such a geometric quench .",
    "the idea is quite simple , but potentially very powerful : it applies directly to any model for which the slavnov formula for wavefunction overlaps is explicitly known , and allows at least in principle to reconstruct the exact subsequent time evolution of wavefunctions , operator expectation values and time - dependent correlation functions via techniques similar to the ones used in the equilibrium case .",
    "on the practical side , since the energy of the states populated by the geometric quench can be obtained nonperturbatively , results can be accurately given for arbitrarily long times after the quench .",
    "moreover , since the space of eigenstates is mapped out in detail via the bethe ansatz , extremely efficient truncations of the required hilbert space sums can be implemented .",
    "we will explore a number of specific cases in forthcoming publications .",
    "we thank n. slavnov for useful discussions .",
