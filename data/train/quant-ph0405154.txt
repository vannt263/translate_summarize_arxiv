    "in this section we describe in detail the conveyor belt synchronization scheme , which was first proposed in @xcite . the two pre - conditions that must be satisfied are those underlying einstein s protocol : a ) we need a physical medium that supports signaling between alice and bob in which the alice - to - bob and bob - to - alice transit times , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are identical ; b ) we require alice and bob to have near - perfect , albeit unsynchronized , clocks , viz . , their relative drift is negligible over a roundtrip time @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . [ in app .",
    "a we discuss some variations of our scheme which permit some softening of these requirements ] .    our protocol can be explained by means of a simple illustrative scenario .",
    "suppose that there is a conveyor belt connecting alice and bob , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nastro ] , moving at speed @xmath4 . upon initiation of the protocol , and",
    "continuing until its completion , alice pours sand onto the belt at points @xmath5 and @xmath6 according to the following schedule : when her clock reads @xmath7 she deposits sand at rate @xmath8 at both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "bob , for his part , removes sand at rate @xmath9 from point @xmath10 when his clock reads @xmath11 .",
    "alice completes the protocol by monitoring the amount of sand at point @xmath12which is after point @xmath6 on the conveyor belt  as a function of @xmath7 , and waiting for it to stabilize to a constant value @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath13 is proportional to the time difference between alice s clock and bob s clock , as we now demonstrate .    in terms of an external reference clock , showing time @xmath14 , we may express @xmath7 and @xmath11the times shown on the clocks in alice s and bob s possession  as follows : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the offset between alice s clock and bob s that the conveyor belt protocol is trying to measure . once the initial transient is over , i.e. , when @xmath17 , we find that @xmath18 where the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sabbia ] ) is the amount of sand that alice deposited at point @xmath5 at time @xmath19 , the second term is the amount of sand that bob removed from point @xmath10 at time @xmath20 , and the third term is the amount of sand that alice added at position @xmath6 at time @xmath14 .",
    "= .9    the three main features of this scheme are : 1 ) no time measurements are needed ; 2 ) the only role played by the signal transit time between alice and bob is setting the duration of the transient that must be endured before the synchronization measurement can be made ; and 3 ) the synchronization precision only depends on the precision with which sand may be added to , removed from , and measured on the conveyor belt .    that our protocol differs dramatically from einstein synchronization",
    "can be seen from the fact that ours is transit - time independent , i.e. , except for its impact on the duration of the conveyor - belt transient , the transit time @xmath21hence the distance between alice and bob , @xmath22plays no role in the protocol .",
    "indeed , neither alice nor bob need to know @xmath21 to run the protocol , nor can they to deduce this transit time by measuring the post - transient amount of sand on the belt at point @xmath12 . a simple modification of our scheme , however , does permit @xmath21 to be measured , so that the distance between alice and bob may be inferred if @xmath4 is known : alice continues to add sand at rate @xmath23 at point @xmath5 , bob ceases any action at point @xmath10 , and alice removes sand at rate @xmath23 from point @xmath6 .",
    "once the ensuing transient is over , the amount of sand on the conveyor belt at point @xmath12 will be @xmath24 if we use microwave signal propagation in lieu of a conveyor belt and the imposition of a positive ( negative ) frequency shift instead of adding ( removing ) sand , the ranging protocol we have just described is then the familiar frequency - modulated continuous wave ( fmcw ) radar @xcite .",
    "now , having illustrated the essentials of conveyor belt clock synchronization in terms of the sand - based protocol , let us address more realistic implementations .",
    "alice and bob may exchange electrical signals , whose voltages are modulated in accord with the conveyor belt idea . alternatively , they may transmit sound waves ( as in sonar applications ) , modulating their frequencies to achieve clock synchronization via our protocol .",
    "the most appealing scenario , however , involves light pulses . in this context alice and bob",
    "may encode synchronization information on the pulses using the polarization direction ( through faraday rotators ) , frequency ( through acousto - optic modulators ) or phase ( through electro - optic modulators ) .",
    "an application of this type is analyzed in the next section .",
    "dispersion - induced pulse spreading and pulse distortion are among the principal performance - limiting factors in schemes that are currently used to synchronize distant clocks @xcite .",
    "we can exploit our protocol s independence of time - of - arrival measurements to devise synchronization schemes that thwart the ill - effects of dispersion . in a previous paper @xcite we achieved this goal by means of quantum - mechanical effects . here , we show that classical pulses can be used to achieve similar dispersion immunity under a wide range of conditions .",
    "= .9    the configuration for classical light - pulse clock synchronization via the conveyor belt protocol is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] .",
    "in essence , it is a polarization - based , time - delay interferometer .",
    "a linearly polarized ( say @xmath25 ) laser source emits intense light pulses of center frequency @xmath26 and bandwidth @xmath27 .",
    "conveyor belt encoding and decoding is achieved by means of time delays . in particular : at points @xmath5 and @xmath6 , alice delays the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) polarization with respect to the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) polarization by an amount proportional to the time shown on her clock ; and at point @xmath10 , bob delays the @xmath30 polarization with respect to the @xmath28 polarization by an amount proportional to the time shown on his clock , with bob s proportionality constant being twice alice s .",
    "the net effect of these actions , as seen at the input port to the polarizing beam splitter pbs , is to delay the @xmath29 component of the returning light pulse relative to that pulse s @xmath31 component by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is bob s proportionality constant ( a dimensionless quantity ) .",
    "alice now obtains the desired synchronization information by measuring @xmath34 , the average photon number in the horizontally - polarized component of the return pulse , by means of the polarizing beam splitter and the integrating photodetector @xmath35 .",
    "because no time - of - arrival information is sought in this measurement , dispersion can be neglected if the @xmath29 component encounters the same dispersion as its @xmath31 counterpart . as shown below , where we analyze the behavior of the fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] system , this common - mode dispersion condition can be relaxed in several ways .",
    "= .75    before delving into the mathematics , an initial comment about our theoretical approach is warranted .",
    "we will employ quantum photodetection theory in our treatment , despite that fact that semiclassical ( shot - noise ) theory is quantitatively correct for the fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] system because it uses coherent - state ( classical ) light @xcite .",
    "our choice in this regard makes it more difficult to connect our work to the literature on laser radar @xcite , which relies on semiclassical theory and could be used , e.g. , to address the performance of time - of - arrival measurements for light - pulse einstein synchronization .",
    "our reason for choosing to use quantum theory is to enable an easy transition to assessing the additional benefits that accrue from the use of nonclassical light ",
    "specifically entangled states  in conveyor belt synchronization .",
    "semiclassical photodetection is unable to treat such systems correctly .",
    "the average photon flux arriving at detector d@xmath36 at time @xmath14 is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the quantum state of the light emitted by the source and the field operators at the detector are given by @xmath39 the annihilation operator @xmath40 destroys a @xmath41 polarized photon of frequency @xmath42 at the location of detector @xmath35 .",
    "the average photon flux arriving at detector @xmath43 is obtained in a similar manner . in order to connect the operators @xmath40 and @xmath44 with those at the source , we first express the @xmath25 and @xmath41 components in terms of their @xmath29 and @xmath31 counterparts : @xmath45 the annihilation operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 may be now linked to the corresponding annihilation operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the source position by accounting for the time - varying delays that alice and bob impose in the conveyor belt protocol .",
    "their actions are equivalent to what occurs in the fig .",
    "[ f : delay ] arrangement , in which the two polarizations impinge on opposite faces of a moving mirror .",
    "electro - optic modulators would be employed in an actual application , but the idealized fig .",
    "[ f : delay ] setup affords us an easy route to calculating the field evolution from the source to the detector .",
    "alice has two fig .",
    "[ f : delay ] setups , one at point @xmath5 and one at point @xmath6 . at time @xmath50",
    "she starts moving both of her mirrors with constant speed @xmath51 , imparting a doppler frequency shift  in the non - relativistic , @xmath52 , limit@xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) to the @xmath31 ( @xmath29 ) polarization of an incoming frequency-@xmath42 field , where @xmath55 is the phase velocity in the propagation medium at frequency @xmath42 .",
    "bob , on the other hand , starts moving his mirror  located at position @xmath10at time @xmath56 with constant speed @xmath57 in the opposite direction to what alice employs .",
    "thus , his action leads to a doppler frequency shift @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) on the @xmath31 ( @xmath29 ) polarization of an incoming frequency-@xmath42 field .",
    "it follows that the overall annihilation operator transformation that we are after is @xmath60 where the term @xmath61 accounts for the distance @xmath62 separating alice and bob , and @xmath63 contains the time shift that is needed to synchronize alice s clock with bob s .",
    "note that we have neglected propagation loss in the roundtrip between alice and bob . because we assume coherent state light in our classical clock synchronization protocol , no loss of generality ensues from this assumption .",
    "in essence , any propagation loss in an actual implementation can be accounted for by attenuating the input state used in the analysis below .    the @xmath64 expression in ( [ deftheta ] ) is easily derived in the non - relativistic limit @xmath65 by observing that @xmath66 is the path length increase which the interferometer introduces for the @xmath31 polarization relative to the @xmath29 polarization ( see fig .",
    "[ f : interf ] ) . in eqs .",
    "( [ delays1 ] ) and ( [ delays2 ] ) the terms @xmath67 represent the dispersive propagation medium encountered by the @xmath29 and @xmath31 polarizations ; @xmath14 refers to propagation _ to _ bob , while @xmath68 refers to propagation _ from _ him .",
    "we neglected doppler frequency shifts in deriving these dispersion terms ; see app .",
    "[ s : relat ] for a fully relativistic calculation .",
    "equations  ( [ delays1 ] ) and ( [ delays2 ] ) show that our interferometer encodes the time - difference information into both polarization components , whereas for synchronization purposes it would be sufficient to encode such information on just one .",
    "[ thus , the scheme adopted here is an instance of the differential conveyor belt protocol described in app .",
    "[ s : appa ] ] .",
    "however , as will be clarified later , the use of only one polarization component does not provide dispersion immunity .",
    "= .6    the initial state of the system is a @xmath25-polarized coherent - state light pulse .",
    "it can be described in the frequency domain as a tensor product of monochromatic coherent states of the form @xmath69 where the ket subscripts refer to polarizations and @xmath70 is a coherent state of frequency @xmath42 with amplitude function @xmath71 that has center frequency @xmath26 and bandwidth @xmath27 , e.g. , a gaussian .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ trasf1])([delays2 ] ) to express the @xmath41-polarized output field in terms of the @xmath29-polarized and @xmath31-polarized input fields and then employing ( [ statoin ] ) we obtain @xmath72 for the average photon flux at the @xmath73 detector .",
    "dispersion in the propagation medium enters this expression through sum and difference terms , i.e. , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the sum term does not contribute to the output of an integrating detector , @xmath76 to suppress the difference term  and hence achieve dispersion immunity  the two polarization components must undergo the same dispersion in their roundtrip propagation between alice and bob , viz .",
    ", @xmath77 under this constraint , the average photon number satisfies @xmath78 where our notation emphasizes the fact that the average photon number depends on the offset between alice s clock and bob s . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : dip ] , the average photon number consists of an envelope of duration @xmath79@xmath80 that is modulated by fringes of frequency @xmath81,which result from interference between the @xmath29 and @xmath31 return pulses at the polarizing beam splitter .",
    "the mean value of this average photon number fringe pattern is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the average photon number of the input state ( [ statoin ] ) .",
    "( remember that propagation loss is ignored in our treatment . )",
    "the extent of the fringe pattern is set by the clock offset @xmath84 beyond which the @xmath29 and @xmath31 return pulses do not overlap at the polarizing beam splitter , so that no interference occurs . when @xmath85 , the average photon number @xmath86 vanishes , because the @xmath29 and @xmath31 return pulses then arrive in synchrony and in phase , forming a @xmath25-polarized field at the polarizing beam splitter .",
    "if we include propagation loss , then the occurrence of a perfect @xmath87 null requires that the @xmath29 and @xmath31 pulses encounter the same loss in their roundtrip travel between alice and bob",
    ". such will be the case if : ( a ) we model loss by assigning imaginary components to the dispersions @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; and ( b ) we require that ( [ condiz ] ) be satisfied for the resulting complex - valued dispersions .    alice completes the conveyor - belt synchronization protocol by using a sequence of pulses  shifted in time  to locate the null of the @xmath34 interference pattern ( see sec .",
    "iia for a more complete description ) .",
    "the accuracy of such a measurement will be @xmath79@xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the fringe width , and",
    "snr is the measurement signal - to - noise ratio that is achieved with this pulse sequence .",
    "when @xmath92 , this accuracy can become comparable to the period @xmath93 of the optical carrier without violating our non - relativistic constraint , i.e. , while maintaining @xmath52 .",
    "note that alice can double the snr of her synchronization by also observing the average photon number @xmath94 from the @xmath43 detector . by energy conservation ,",
    "@xmath95 so that this additional measurement has a complementary fringe pattern , whose global maximum is located at the offset between alice s clock and bob s .",
    "= .9    in essence , our scheme embodies the precision of phase - locking schemes such as @xcite , while maintaining the ability to directly recover the time difference between alice s clock and bob s .",
    "interestingly , because we measure the average photon number , i.e. , the constant quantity @xmath86 , our protocol is immune to dispersion provided that condition ( [ condiz ] ) is satisfied .",
    "how can we enforce such a condition in practice ?",
    "usually dispersion in an optical system is polarization dependent , so that eq .",
    "( [ condiz ] ) can not be satisfied directly .",
    "however , it is possible to transfer the polarization degree of freedom to other degrees of freedom that undergo the same dispersion .",
    "for example , if the medium is sufficiently homogeneous in space , then alice may send her pulses as co - polarized , spatially separated beams  which she recombines in an appropriate interferometer after they return from bob  to achieve the equivalent of ( [ condiz ] ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the medium is sufficiently stable in time , then alice may send two co - polarized , temporally separated pulses that she recombines in a manner akin to the polarization - restoration scheme describe in @xcite to achieve the equivalent of ( [ condiz ] ) .",
    "alice needs to identify the global minimum  the null  of the @xmath34 fringe pattern in order to complete the conveyor - belt clock synchronization protocol . in order to do",
    "so she will send a sequence of pulses , and employ the resulting @xmath41 photon number measurements from the @xmath35 detector . for each pulse",
    ", she will vary slightly the delays that she imposes at points @xmath5 and @xmath6 , adding a distinct constant @xmath96 to her starting time @xmath50 for the @xmath97th pulse , viz .",
    ", she will treat the first pulse as if her clock s initial time were @xmath98 , she will treat the second pulse as if her clock s initial time were @xmath99 , etc .",
    ", something she can accomplish without knowing @xmath50 .",
    "bob , however , will continue to base his delays on the time shown on his clock . from @xmath41 photon number measurements made on this pulse sequence",
    ", alice can estimate the fringe pattern @xmath100 , and hence pinpoint the location of the null .",
    "the use of quantum resources can improve the performance of traditional clock synchronization and positioning protocols @xcite . the same is true for conveyor belt synchronization . in particular , the use of frequency - entangled pulses offers greater immunity to dispersion than is obtainable from the classical version of the protocol , as we now will show .",
    "suppose that the input state to the fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] interferometer is a stream of time - resolved , frequency - entangled ( @xmath101 ) bi - photons from a type - ii phase matched parametric downconverter . instead of measuring the photon number at the output of the @xmath35 detector , we now detect photon coincidences , i.e. , near - simultaneous arrivals of photons at the @xmath35 and @xmath43 detectors .",
    "it can then be shown that condition ( [ condiz ] ) for dispersion - immune classical operation is replaced by the following less stringent condition under which the quantum system is not degraded by dispersion : @xmath102 interestingly , eq .",
    "( [ miracolo ] ) does not require the two polarization components to undergo the same dispersion : this effect results from the quantum frequency - correlations of the two photons @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ miracolo ] ) will be satisfied when the odd - order terms in the taylor - series expansions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 about @xmath26 are equal .",
    "we now present the essentials of the quantum dispersion cancellation derivation .",
    "the clock synchronization signature that we are seeking is embedded in the probability that the @xmath35 and @xmath43 detectors both register photons within a coincidence interval whose duration @xmath103 greatly exceeds @xmath104 , the reciprocal of the downconverter s fluorescence bandwidth , while still being short enough that the probability of two bi - photons being present in this time interval is negligible .",
    "this probability can be calculated by considering a bi - photon initial state of the following form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the state s spectral function versus detuning @xmath107 from frequency degeneracy , i.e. , when both component photons are at the center frequency , @xmath26 .",
    "the coincidence probability is then given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the joint probability density for detectors @xmath35 and @xmath43 to register photons at times @xmath14 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "unlike the classical case considered earlier , in which the clock synchronization signature appeared in a fringe pattern , the coincidence probability @xmath111 exhibits a `` mandel dip '' ( quantum interference ) @xcite of width @xmath112 whose null location is specified by the offset between alice s clock and bob s : @xmath113 thus , alice can perform quantum dispersion - cancelling clock synchronization by a time - shifting procedure similar to what we outlined in sec .",
    "[ s : step ] for the classical case , obtaining an accuracy @xmath79@xmath114 .",
    "an analogous quantum dispersion - cancelling synchronization result was reported in @xcite , using a different interferometer .",
    "for the same snr value , the classical synchronization system will outperform the quantum synchronization system when @xmath115 , a condition that is unlikely to be satisfied for typical @xmath79thz downconverter bandwidths . on the other hand",
    ", we may well inquire whether a frequency-@xmath26 fringe pattern might be imposed onto the quantum system s mandel dip , dramatically enhancing its accuracy .",
    "from @xcite it appears that certain experimental configurations allow fringes to be retained with use of the bi - photon state ( [ tbst ] ) .",
    "as the authors of @xcite point out , however , there is no quantum dispersion cancellation in the regime in which the fringes are present , i.e. , when the variable delay in their experiment is placed _ after _ the beam splitter .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that this regime does not exploit the quantum correlation which is present in the state ( [ tbst ] ) : the signal from one of the two detectors is used only to ` filter out ' a single @xmath25 polarized photon from the state ( [ tbst ] ) which is then sent into the interferometer .",
    "this means that the fringes - present regime in @xcite is equivalent to a single - photon interferometer .",
    "so , had the authors of @xcite measured the average photon flux resulting from a coherent - state input  instead of the coincidences resulting from a bi - photon input  they would have obtained the same fringes .",
    "we have presented an optical implementation of the `` conveyor belt '' clock synchronization protocol that uses classical sources and , under rather general conditions , is not disturbed by the presence of a dispersive medium .",
    "the advantages of using quantum sources have been discussed and compared with previous results on the same topic @xcite .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the alice - to - bob and bob - to - alice propagation times are identical , viz . ,",
    "this amounts to having bob located at the midpoint of the conveyor belt in fig .",
    "[ f : nastro ] .",
    "we can eliminate this constraint by means of a differential version of our protocol .",
    "differential schemes  such as the two - way method for einstein clock synchronization  are conventionally employed to get rid of asymmetries .",
    "the strategy we choose is to introduce a second conveyor belt that proceeds in the opposite direction with respect to the first one ( i.e. , it runs from @xmath6 to @xmath5 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : diff ] .",
    "the protocol is carried out as before : alice and bob respectively add and remove sand at points @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath10 , but now they do this on both conveyor belts . after the initial transient is over , the amount of sand that alice measures at the output of the first conveyor belt ( point @xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ f : diff ] ) is given by @xmath118 where @xmath21 is the transit time from @xmath5 to @xmath10 and @xmath119 is the transit time from @xmath10 to @xmath6 .",
    "likewise , the amount of sand that alice measures , after the initial transient , at point @xmath120 at the output of the second conveyor belt satisfies @xmath121 clearly , @xmath122 provides the desired synchronization information without requiring @xmath123 .",
    "note that the differential scheme requires that the forward transmission times from @xmath5 to @xmath10 and from @xmath10 to @xmath6 equal the backward transmission times from @xmath10 to @xmath5 and @xmath6 to @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these equalities can be achieved in optical implementations in which the forward ( backward ) transmitter and backward ( forward ) receiver at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are co - located .",
    "the requirement that alice and bob possess perfect clocks ",
    "i.e , that their clocks run at the same rate and do not drift appreciably during a signal roundtrip time  may also be softened .",
    "to do so , alice must monitor the amount of sand on the conveyor belt as a function of time , since it will not be a constant , even after the initial transient has passed .",
    "for example , suppose alice and bob have drift - free clocks that run at different rates .",
    "insofar as the conveyor belt protocol is concerned , this is equivalent to saying that alice and bob have clock s running at the same rate , but that bob uses proportionality constant @xmath124 , instead of @xmath125 , when he removes sand from point @xmath10 . equation  ( [ sabbia ] ) then becomes @xmath126 alice can now use a feedback loop to null out the @xmath14-dependent part of ( [ sabbia4 ] ) and thus make her proportionality constant , hence her clock rate , the same as bob s .",
    "a similar procedure will also work if bob s clock drifts slowly  with respect to the signal roundtrip time ",
    "with respect to alice s .",
    "the conveyor belt protocol requires alice to deposit sand at rate @xmath8 and bob to remove sand at rate @xmath9 . with the passage of time",
    ", these requirements will soon get out of hand .",
    "the essential behavior of the conveyor belt protocol can be retained , however , by periodically restarting the protocol at time intervals that are long compared to both the roundtrip propagation time and the offset between alice s clock and bob s .",
    "a more convenient alternative might be for alice and bob to periodically reverse their rates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : rate ] .",
    "in fact , this periodic - ramp approach is what is used in fmcw radar @xcite .",
    "we use lorentz transformations to go from the source outputs ( in the laboratory reference frame ) , to the fields at the moving mirrors ( in the mirrors reference frames ) , to the return pulses ( back in the laboratory reference frame ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to show that ( [ deftheta]) ( [ dispersive ] ) become @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",

    "<S> a protocol for synchronizing distant clocks is proposed that does not rely on the arrival times of the signals which are exchanged , and an optical implementation based on coherent - state pulses is described . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol is not limited by any dispersion that may be present in the propagation medium through which the light signals are exchanged . </S>",
    "<S> possible improvements deriving from the use of quantum - mechanical effects are also addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> the synchronization of distant clocks is of considerable importance for communications , multi - processor computations , astronomy , geology , the global positioning system ( gps ) , etc . </S>",
    "<S> existing synchronization protocols fall into two categories : eddington adiabatic transfer @xcite and einstein clock synchronization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eddington s method requires that the two parties ( say alice and bob ) exchange a running clock , e.g. , alice sends her clock to bob , and he compares it with his own . </S>",
    "<S> this method does not require time - of - arrival measurements , but it is usually impractical because a complex system ( a clock ) must be exchanged . </S>",
    "<S> it is much easier to implement einstein s method , in which all that is exchanged is a sequence of signal pulses , e.g. , alice sends a signal pulse to bob , which he then returns to alice . by recording the signal </S>",
    "<S> s times of departure and arrival , alice and bob can synchronize their clocks . </S>",
    "<S> a variation of one or the other of these protocols is invariably employed whenever two clocks must be synchronized @xcite : either it is necessary to exchange clocks , or there is an explicit dependence on time - of - arrival measurements . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples of einstein clock synchronization are the `` two way '' protocols in which alice and bob both exchange signals , phase - locked loop techniques , and pseudo - random code correlation measurements such as are used in gps .    here </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a synchronization protocol that is neither equivalent to eddington nor to einstein synchronization , but instead embodies the best features of each . as in einstein s scheme , </S>",
    "<S> it is based on exchanging signals , thus avoiding the technological problems associated with the exchange of complex systems such as clocks ( `` shocks on clocks '' ) or entangled systems @xcite . as in eddington </S>",
    "<S> s scheme , no time - of - arrival measurements are required , thus avoiding the problems associated with such measurements , e.g. , those arising from dispersion in the signal s propagation medium . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on implementations that rely on classical signals , but the method is well - suited for intrinsically quantum - mechanical clock synchronization protocols @xcite .    in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s : schema ] we introduce the `` conveyor belt '' protocol and describe its basic features ( some useful variations are discussed in app .  </S>",
    "<S> a ) . a list of possible implementations in different physical contexts is also given . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s : sasha ] we present an implementation that relies on polarized laser pulses . under rather general conditions </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this implementation s attainable synchronization accuracy is unaffected by any dispersion which may be present in the propagation medium . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s : quantum ] we show how quantum - mechanical effects may be used to enhance the protocol s dispersion suppression : employing frequency - entangled pulses affords dispersion cancellation in even more general circumstances than is the case for implementations using classical ( laser ) light pulses . </S>"
